This includes profiling against Twelve Manipulation Vectors and their corresponding Twelve Protection Vectors, modeling the Manipulation Potential Field ($V_{manip}$) and Force ($F_{manip}$), analyzing Manipulation Wound Channel formation ($\\\\Phi_{manip}$), assessing Target Vulnerability ($S_{vuln}$) and Protection Resilience ($R_{prot}$), and estimating the Probabilistic Success Model ($P(success|manip)$).",

It often involves lowering the target's $T_a$ to their own values, increasing their effective $\\Gamma$ (reducing critical discernment), and using $K_i$-resonant pacing or framing to create a 'manipulation wound channel' that bypasses conscious defenses. Understanding these dynamics allows for the identification of manipulative tactics and the formulation of resonant protection strategies.",
