    "coreTransformationAchieved": "Transforms input data describing a practice (its goals, methods, frequency, duration, practitioner characteristics, and context) into a quantitative assessment of its effectiveness and coherence. This includes profiling across Twelve Dimensions of Effective Practice, modeling its Practice Potential Field ($V_{practice}$) and Practice Coherence Score (PCS), analyzing Practice Wound Channel dynamics ($\\\\Phi_{practice}$ – skill embedding/habit formation), and evaluating the Skill Acquisition Model ($dS/dt$).",

Diagnose why a current practice may not be yielding desired results by identifying weaknesses in its resonant structure (low PCS or misalignment in specific Dimensions).\n3. Predict the rate of learning or change ($dS/dt$) associated with a given practice and estimate the time or effort required to reach a target proficiency or state.\n4. Understand how to structure practice for optimal $K_i$-resonant entrainment and feedback integration, leading to deeper and more stable learning ('Practice Wound Channels').\n5.
