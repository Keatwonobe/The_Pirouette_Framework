    "coreTransformationAchieved": "Transforms input data describing an entity (individual, organization, research project), its environment, and its interaction patterns into a quantitative assessment of its serendipity potential. This includes profiling against Twelve Resonant Serendipity Dimensions, modeling the Serendipity Potential Field ($V_{serendipity}$), calculating Serendipity Event Probability ($P(S|E,O)$), analyzing Serendipity Wound Channel formation ($\\\\Phi_{serendipity}$), classifying types of serendipitous discovery, and identifying strategies to cultivate serendipity.",

Optimal Time-Adherence ($T_a^{entity}$) balances focus with flexibility; optimal Gladiator Force ($\\Gamma^{entity}$) allows interaction with a wide range of opportunities without losing coherence; and $K_i$-resonant sensitivity enables recognition of subtle patterns or connections. Serendipitous events create unique 'wound channels' that can reorient an entity's trajectory.",
