        "theoreticalInsight": "The complex behavior of the logistic map, $x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n)$, is entirely determined by its control parameter 'r'. By inverting the relationship, one can treat 'r' not as an input but as an output, enabling 'chaos tuning'\u2014the precise engineering of a desired dynamical regime. This is a form of resonant system design where the goal is a specific temporal pattern (a periodic orbit) or complexity level (a Lyapunov exponent). While not a direct Pirouette module, it serves as a tool for modeling simplified systems where a periodic orbit can be seen as a high-$T_a$ (coherent) state and chaos as a low-$T_a$ state.",
