  "primaryPurposeConciseStatement": "To derive, from first principles of the Pirouette Framework, the local Gladiator Force field Γ(x,t) in both physical and informational domains by analysing propagation curvature and coherence gradients, thereby revealing the latent ‘defensive pressure’ that sustains Cognitive Gravity Wells and other attractors.",

When re‑expressed in informational space, Γ manifests as the curvature‑inducing pressure that limits an idea’s mean‑free path. Thus, the same differential geometry that traps a particle in physical space also traps concepts in semantic space.",
