    "coreTransformationAchieved": "Transforms system data, typically potential fields $V(\\Gamma, T_a, \\phi)$ in Compass Space or equivalent parameter spaces, into a 'Time-Adherence Curl Map' or 'Time Lock Map' identifying time eddy zones. It quantifies eddy intensity, correlates these zones with local Time-Adherence ($T_a$) values, and analyzes their contribution to system stability, locking geometries, and oscillatory behaviors like mesonic pulses.",

These eddies act as temporal latches, enabling coherent relationships between field configurations that would otherwise be incompatible. 'Locking geometry emerges exactly where time disadherence is highest'. The Ki constant influences the re-coherence timescale and oscillatory patterns (e.g., mesonic pulse return) associated with these eddies.",
