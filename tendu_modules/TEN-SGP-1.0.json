A supportive shell acts as a 'Coherence Reservoir' or a low-$\\Gamma$ buffer zone, providing a high-coherence, low-stress local environment that protects the altruistic entity from the full cost of its coherence contributions, thus stabilizing its own Resonant Persistence ($R_P$) and enabling sustained altruistic action.",
