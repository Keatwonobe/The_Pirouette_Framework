This process isolates and quantifies fault loci, highlighting regions of misalignment, decoherence, or anomalous resonance that may indicate impending failure or systemic drift.",

        "theoreticalInsight": "Stable systems exhibit predictable resonance patterns and phase relationships governed by Pirouette constants. Instead of searching for these patterns directly in a noisy field (as TEN-URLA does), Resonance Fault Detection assumes a nominal, healthy state, computationally inverts this expected pattern to create a 'null template,' and then subtracts the observed field. In a perfectly healthy system, the result is near zero. Significant non-zero residues ('fault loci') immediately highlight deviations, decoherence, or stress, indicating potential system faults long before they cascade into catastrophic failure. It is a search for 'anti-resonance' or dissonance against an ideal background.",
