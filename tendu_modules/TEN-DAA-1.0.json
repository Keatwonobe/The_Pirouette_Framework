It further provides an assessment of its stability based on prime factorization of its dimensional characteristics and its relationship to fundamental Fold Constants (Fi, Pi, Bi, Ki), offering insights into its inherent resonance patterns, evolutionary pathways, and interaction behaviors.",

Systems stabilize or transform based on their ability to express these prime dimensional forms and their harmonic relationships with Fold Constants (Fi, Pi, Bi, Ki). This 'folded space paradigm' treats dimensions as emergent properties of resonance.",
