    "conceptualAnchor": {
      "theoreticalInsight": "Information and resonance patterns are not always strictly confined within their domain of origin. 'Bleed Resonance' describes how coherent patterns or field effects in one domain can penetrate boundaries and induce resonant structures or transfer influence to adjacent or interacting domains, even across significant topological separations. This transfer is governed by the permeability of the boundary (influenced by the $T_a$ and $\\Gamma$ of the involved domains) and the potential for resonant alignment (influenced by $K_i$ and phase relationships).",

In the context of bleed, higher $\\Gamma$ values for a domain boundary may imply greater porosity or 'softness,' making it more susceptible to bleed-through, contrasting its role in intra-domain entity confinement."
