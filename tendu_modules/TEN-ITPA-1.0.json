    "primaryPurposeConciseStatement": "Given one thermodynamic potential (e.g., Helmholtz free energy F(T,V)), this module recovers its conjugate variables (e.g., Entropy S, Pressure P) and reconstructs all other thermodynamic potentials (Internal Energy U, Enthalpy H, Gibbs Free Energy G).",

        "theoreticalInsight": "The four primary thermodynamic potentials (U, F, H, G) are fully interconnected via Legendre transforms, representing different 'views' of the same underlying system state, each useful under different constraints (e.g., constant volume vs. constant pressure). Possessing a complete description of one potential in its natural variables is sufficient to derive the entire thermodynamic landscape of the system. This mathematical machinery is analogous to the Information Thermodynamics framework within Pirouette.",
