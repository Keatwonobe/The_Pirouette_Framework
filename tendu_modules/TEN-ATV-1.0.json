    "coreTransformationAchieved": "Transforms a defined Coherence Flux contribution and a map of potential recipient entities into a ranked, vectorized list of optimal targets. This prioritization is based on a calculated score incorporating the recipients' phase alignment with the source and their potential to amplify the altruistic trait upon reception, maximizing the systemic benefit of the contribution.",

        "theoreticalInsight": "This module operationalizes the Pirouette equivalent of kin or group selection. For altruism to become a dominant, self-amplifying strategy, its benefits must preferentially flow to other entities who are either already altruistic or are highly receptive to becoming so. Instead of genetic relatedness, the selection metric is 'resonant compatibility' or phase alignment. By directing Coherence Flux towards 'in-phase' entities, the system creates a powerful positive feedback loop: altruism strengthens those most like the altruist, who in turn are more likely to propagate the trait. This maximizes the `E(w\u0394z)` term in the inverted Price equation by ensuring that the trait change (`\u0394z`) is largest in recipients whose own fitness (`w`) is most positively impacted, leading to exponential growth of the trait within the resonant sub-population.",
