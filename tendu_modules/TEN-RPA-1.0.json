Identify leverage points for enhancing system stability by understanding how it naturally disperses stress or allocates resources.\n3. Predict potential points of failure or transition by monitoring parameters near identified critical points.\n4. Design new systems that inherently incorporate robust self-correction mechanisms based on observed inverse Pareto distributions in successful natural or artificial systems."
