Key decisions act as funnel inversions or forks, leading down one path while leaving others dormant.

This module uses a 'reverse-funnel sweep'—a conceptual inversion of the current life vector—to unfold the local resonance manifold and reveal these nearby, dormant coherence channels, offering a map of potential for reintegration and purpose discovery.",
