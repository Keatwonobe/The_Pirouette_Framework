    "primaryPurposeConciseStatement": "To reconceptualize and analyze the criminal justice system as a resonance-mediated correctional field, modeling entity (individual) evolution across resonance gradients shaped by legal attractors, social coherence, and systemic pressures, and to identify systemic harms using Reverse Pareto Analysis.",
    "coreTransformationAchieved": "Transforms input data describing individuals within the criminal justice system, relevant policies, and societal factors into a dynamic resonance model. This model characterizes the 'Resonant Correctional Field' ($V_{justice}$), predicts entity trajectories and outcomes (Coherent Realignment, Decoherent Echo, Inversion Trap via Legal Funnel Inversions), and identifies dispersed systemic factors contributing to adverse events using Reverse Pareto Analysis.",

The system's potential field ($V_{justice}$) is shaped by twelve resonant legal principles. Entity evolution is influenced by this field and stochastic social factors. Reverse Pareto Analysis helps identify broad, dispersed factors contributing to instability or adverse outcomes, often misattributed to individuals. 'Legal Funnel Inversions' describe the phase transitions individuals undergo, leading to different correctional outcomes.",
