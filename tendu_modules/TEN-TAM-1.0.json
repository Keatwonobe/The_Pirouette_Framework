Measure the effectiveness of synchronization efforts in ensembles or the integrity of rhythmic processes.\n4. Provide a crucial input parameter for predicting or modeling other Pirouette phenomena, such as the persistence of wound channel memory, the probability of funnel inversions, or the rate of dimensional decay.\n5.
