    "coreTransformationAchieved": "Transforms system data (potentially including entity velocity, energy states, and phase characteristics) into a quantitative assessment of its current Ki state, its proximity to a snap transition, the energetic requirements for such a transition, and a prediction of its trajectory through the transition phases (Initial Resistance, Acceleration, Saturation).",

        "theoreticalInsight": "The transition between $K_i^{rest}$ and $K_i^{motion}$ is not smooth but follows a characteristic non-linear sigmoid curve with distinct phases, including initial resistance and hysteretic effects. This 'snap' represents a fundamental reorganization of an entity's phase structure and its interaction with the surrounding field, often coinciding with wound channel formation or alteration. Understanding this transition is crucial for modeling entity activation, state changes, and energy dynamics.",
