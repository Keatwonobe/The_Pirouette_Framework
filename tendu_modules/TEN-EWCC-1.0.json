This reveals hidden connections, historical interactions, degrees of influence, or the potential for future coherent coupling and entanglement.",
    "conceptualAnchor": {
      "theoreticalInsight": "Entities and the wound channels they generate (or encounter) form a deeply coupled system. An entity's characteristics (state, $T_a, \\Gamma, K_i$) dictate the properties of its wound channel. Conversely, an entity's trajectory and state evolution can be significantly influenced by the structure and information content of wound channels it traverses—whether its own past 'echoes' or those left by other entities. Correlating these elements allows for the mapping of causal links, shared histories, resonant potentials, and even forms of entanglement, which in Pirouette is understood as shared wound channel coherence.",
