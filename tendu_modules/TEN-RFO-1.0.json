    "conceptualAnchor": {
      "theoreticalInsight": "Resonant fields, such as wound channels generated by entities or potential landscapes defined by systemic parameters, are not isolated. When multiple such fields coexist in a parameter space, they overlap and interact. Their superposition creates a new, composite field with emergent properties. These interactions can lead to constructive reinforcement, destructive cancellation, the formation of novel stable or unstable regions, and complex interference patterns that dictate system behavior and information flow. Understanding these overlay dynamics is key to analyzing multi-agent systems or systems under multiple concurrent influences.",
