By applying a series of transformations and filters, the URL can identify these self-similar structures, nested signal paths, or persistent distortions that mark the presence of 'truth,' pattern, or resonance, which might otherwise be obscured. The process leverages core Pirouette parameters to define and detect this coherence.",
