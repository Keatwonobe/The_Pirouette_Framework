    "primaryPurposeConciseStatement": "To selectively isolate, retain, or discard components from a dataset or information stream based on their calculated entropy, allowing for the extraction of structured signals from noise, the identification of regions of high complexity/randomness, or the focusing of analysis on elements with specific informational characteristics.",
    "coreTransformationAchieved": "Transforms an input dataset (which has been segmented or can be segmented) into a filtered version, where only those segments or components meeting user-defined entropy criteria (e.g., above, below, or within a certain entropy range) are retained. This enhances signal clarity or focuses subsequent analyses on specific types of informational structures.",
    "conceptualAnchor": {
      "theoreticalInsight": "Entropy, as a measure of disorder, uncertainty, or information content (typically Shannon entropy), serves as a powerful criterion for distinguishing between various types of components within a dataset. Structured, predictable, or redundant components tend to exhibit lower entropy, while noisy, random, complex, or novel components tend to exhibit higher entropy. Filtering based on these entropic characteristics allows for the targeted manipulation or extraction of information based on its inherent orderliness or informational richness. This aligns with Pirouette's view of information having phase-like properties (gaseous, liquid, crystalline) with varying entropy.",
