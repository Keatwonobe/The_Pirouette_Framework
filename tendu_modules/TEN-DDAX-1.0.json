This includes profiling arguments against Twelve Axiological Vectors, modeling the Debate Potential Field ($V_{debate}$) and Argument Force ($F_{arg}$), analyzing Persuasion Vector Alignment ($\\\\vec{P}_{align}$) and Debate Wound Channel formation ($\\\\Phi_{debate}$), and modeling Consensus Formation ($C(t)$).",

Successful debate leads to vector alignment and potentially a new, shared resonant state (consensus).",
