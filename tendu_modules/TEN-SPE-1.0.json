This module operates on the premise that by applying adapted analytical techniques, such as modified Stochastic Gulping for segmentation or analyzing the characteristics of these few 'gulps', indicative estimations of $T_a, \\Gamma,$ and $K_i$ can be made. These estimations, while less precise than those from comprehensive data, can offer valuable initial insights or a 'temperature reading' of the system's state, guiding further investigation or decision-making under uncertainty. The accuracy is inherently limited by data sparsity, but the goal is to extract maximal indicative information.",
