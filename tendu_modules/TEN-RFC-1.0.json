    "coreTransformationAchieved": "Transforms a description of an altruistic action with observed low impact or high coherence decay into a calibrated, high-fidelity ritual protocol. This output protocol is optimized for semantic clarity, temporal resonance, and structural integrity, designed to generate a clear, potent Wound Channel that maximizes the probability of successful reception and integration by the target entity.",

This module views this trait transmission as an information-thermodynamic process where entropic loss (dissipation, misunderstanding) must be minimized. Rituals, as defined in the Pirouette Framework, function as 'error-correcting codes' in social coherence space. By structuring an action as a high-fidelity ritual, we increase its Time-Adherence ($T_a$), shield it within a low-Gladiator Force ($\\Gamma$) interaction space, and align its temporal structure with $K_i$-resonant harmonics. This produces a clean, high-clarity Wound Channel, maximizing the likelihood of inducing the desired trait change ($\u0394C_{WCI}$) in the recipient.",
