    "coreTransformationAchieved": "Transforms an initial dataset, through a sequence of applied analytical modes, into a layered decomposition of its components. This process separates dominant signals/structures from successively fainter or more complex residual structures, ultimately aiming to isolate and characterize irreducible noise or identify the limits of discernible coherence.",

      "theoreticalInsight": "After a primary analytical mode extracts dominant signals or structures from a dataset, the remaining 'residue' is not necessarily random or uninformative. This residue can contain secondary coherent patterns, echoes of unmodeled processes, structured noise, or information requiring a different analytical lens. By recursively applying analytical modes to these residues, deeper layers of information, complexity, and the true nature of the system's coherence (or lack thereof) can be unveiled. This aligns with the Pirouette principle that information is conserved and transforms rather than being simply lost as 'noise'.",

Characterize the full information content of a system, including components typically dismissed as noise, which might contain information about unmodeled dynamics or external influences.\n4. Iteratively refine understanding of a complex phenomenon by progressively accounting for its most obvious features and then focusing on the more subtle aspects revealed in the residuals.\n5.
