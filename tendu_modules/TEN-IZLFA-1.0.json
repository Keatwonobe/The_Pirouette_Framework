    "coreTransformationAchieved": "Transforms empirical rank-frequency data into an estimated power-law exponent ($\u03b1$) and normalization constant (C). Alternatively, it transforms a desired statistical property (e.g., tail coverage) into the specific distribution parameters ($\u03b1, k$) that produce that property.",

        "theoreticalInsight": "Power-law distributions are ubiquitous in complex systems and describe phenomena where a small number of items have high frequency/rank and a 'long tail' of items has low frequency/rank. This module solves the inverse problem: inferring the law from the data. It is the core characterization engine for Pirouette's Reverse Pareto Analysis, which analyzes the stabilizing effects of such distributions. The exponent \u03b1 is a critical measure of concentration and inequality in a system.",
