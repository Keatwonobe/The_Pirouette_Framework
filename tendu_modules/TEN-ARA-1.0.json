    "coreTransformationAchieved": "Transforms input data describing an artwork (its form, content, context) and observer interactions into a quantitative and qualitative assessment of its resonant properties. This includes profiling across the Twelve Resonant Artistic Vectors, calculating the Artistic Resonance Equation ($A_{res}$), analyzing Time-Adherence ($T_a$) of interpretation and Gladiator Force ($\\Gamma$) of artistic boundaries, modeling its Metaphysical Wound Channel ($\\\\Phi_{artwork}$), and assessing the probability of inducing Observer Inversion States.",

        "theoreticalInsight": "Art acts as a catalyst for wound channel formation in observers, creating a resonant bridge to deeper layers of reality or collective consciousness. Its power ($A_{res}$) derives from the coherent alignment of its artistic vectors, which can induce Observer Inversion Statesâ€”transformative shifts in perception. Time-Adherence ($T_a$) of interpretation reflects the stability of meaning; Gladiator Force ($\\Gamma$) of boundaries defines its openness to interpretation; and $K_i$-modulated rhythms underpin aesthetic experience.",
