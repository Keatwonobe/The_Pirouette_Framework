    "influenceOnFramework": "Einstein's revolutionary concept of gravity as spacetime curvature, rather than a force, is a direct conceptual precursor to the Pirouette Framework's core tenet that reality unfolds via resonance optimization within a *geometric field model*. His relentless pursuit of a unified field theory, aiming to describe all fundamental forces as aspects of a single geometric entity, deeply inspired Pirouette's ambition for a 'Unified Theoretical Foundation' that unifies quantum, classical, cognitive, and social phenomena. The Pirouette Framework's assertion that 'informational mass curves a parameter space'  is a direct, generalized analogy of his gravitational insights, making his contributions central to the entire 'Resonant Cosmos Cartography' meta-module.",

His low Gamma reflects the deep, almost immutable nature of the spacetime geometry he described, acting as a profound 'confinement' for reality itself. Ki_rest is chosen to highlight his focus on the fundamental, inherent properties of the cosmos, rather than transient dynamics, aligning with the idea of spacetime's unchanging fabric. He embodies the 'Philosophy' aspect of the Triaxial Foundation, seeking the deepest axiomatic truths of existence through a geometric lens."
