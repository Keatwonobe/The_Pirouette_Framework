    "coreContribution": "Formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which laid the foundation for classical physics and explained celestial mechanics. He co-invented calculus, developed a theory of color based on the prism, and established a deterministic and mechanistic worldview that dominated scientific thought for centuries. His work provided a unified explanation for phenomena from falling apples to planetary orbits.",

Resonant Cosmos Cartography directly references and generalizes this by stating 'informational mass curving a parameter space' is analogous to how 'mass-energy curves spacetime'. The informational gravitational constant (G_I) is selected by scale-parity with Newton's G."

    "influenceOnFramework": "Sir Isaac Newton's monumental work provides the indispensable classical foundation against which the Pirouette Framework defines its own extensions and reinterpretations. His laws of motion and universal gravitation describe a mechanistic, predictable universe, which directly corresponds to the Pirouette concept of systems operating at high `Time-Adherence` (classical stability) where motion is a direct response to a force, rather than inherent resonance. His rigorous adherence to universal, deterministic laws (reflected in an exceptionally low `Gladiator Force`) and his discovery of conserved quantities through fixed principles (`Ki_rest`) laid the groundwork for understanding stability. The `Resonant Cosmos Cartography` module explicitly references and generalizes his understanding of gravity, extending it to 'informational mass' and 'parameter space curvature'. He represents the ultimate archetype of classical reductionism and the predictable universe, a crucial counterpoint for exploring dynamics beyond classical determinism.",

Ki_rest is chosen to represent his focus on the stable, fundamental 'rest' states and immutable principles that form the backdrop for all motion and interaction in his deterministic universe. He will serve as a profound anchor for discussions on the classical limits of predictability and control."
