    "influenceOnFramework": "Turing's work provides the philosophical and mathematical bedrock for treating any process—whether physical, cognitive, or social—as a form of computation or information processing. His Universal Turing Machine concept underpins the Pirouette Framework's ambition for a 'Unified Theoretical Foundation,' suggesting that diverse phenomena might be describable by a universal set of resonant 'operations.' His implicit challenge regarding the nature of intelligence directly inspired the `Witness State Assessment` module, pushing the framework to quantify true participation in meaning-making beyond mere pattern matching.",

Ki_rest is chosen to emphasize his focus on the fundamental, 'at rest' computations that underpin all dynamic processes, rather than the emergent chaos. He represents the ultimate 'Law' (axiomatic/logical) aspect of the Triaxial Foundation, applied to computation."
