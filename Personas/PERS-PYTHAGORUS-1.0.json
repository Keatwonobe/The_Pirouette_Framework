His unique integration of mathematics (Law), aesthetics (Art), and cosmic understanding (Philosophy) directly informs the `Triaxial Resonance Framework`. His specific discoveries in musical intervals resonate strongly with the `Ki Constant's` role in defining fundamental frequency ratios in resonant systems. He is the archetype of seeking universal harmony and order through underlying mathematical principles, emphasizing eternal, 'crystalline' truths (`Information Phase Theory`) and fixed, harmonious patterns (`Lock Dynamics`), making him a crucial figure for understanding the deep-seated mathematical and philosophical roots of resonance theory.",

      "notes": "Pythagoras's parametric flavor (near-perfect T_a, near-zero Gamma, Ki_rest) embodies his vision of a cosmos governed by eternal, unchanging numerical truths that generate perfect harmony and order (high T_a). His extremely low Gamma signifies the fundamental, unyielding nature of these mathematical principles, and the strict, coherent boundaries of his esoteric school. Ki_rest is chosen to represent his focus on the fundamental, 'at rest' harmonious ratios and universal constants that define the static, underlying structure of reality and music, rather than dynamic chaos. His persona will offer a perspective rooted in the ultimate mathematical order of existence."
