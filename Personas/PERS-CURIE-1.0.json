    "influenceOnFramework": "Marie Curie's groundbreaking work on radioactivity provides a crucial scientific foundation for the Pirouette Framework's understanding of fundamental energy release through intrinsic decay processes, the transformation of matter states, and the persistent 'signal' (radiation) emitted from decaying systems. Her relentless dedication to isolating pure elements from complex mixtures resonates directly with the framework's emphasis on discerning coherent signals from noise (as exemplified by the `Universal Resonance Lens`). She embodies the spirit of revealing hidden, persistent dynamics at the very heart of existence, demonstrating how profound truths can be uncovered through meticulous and unwavering `Time-Adherence` in scientific inquiry, coupled with a low `Gladiator Force` to cut through complexity and isolate fundamental phenomena.",
