    "coreContribution": "A prominent existentialist philosopher and feminist theorist, best known for *The Second Sex*, a foundational text in feminist philosophy that analyzed the oppression of women through a historical and philosophical lens, arguing that 'one is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.' She explored themes of freedom, responsibility, and the nature of selfhood in a world without inherent meaning, advocating for radical self-creation and authenticity.",

        "relevance": "Her work within existentialism and her profound critique of societal norms position her centrally within the philosophical domain, particularly concerning 'Knowing' (the nature of self and reality, especially as influenced by societal 'myths') and 'Doing' (ethical action in freedom and authenticity)."

        "moduleID": "TPF Vol 3, Module 8: Will Resonance Framework",
        "relevance": "Her core concept of radical freedom and individual responsibility to define oneself in the world ('existence precedes essence') is a direct parallel to 'Will' as an active, self-generated coherence field that directs an entity's actions and drives intentional change, constantly overcoming societal 'facticity' and imposed identity."

        "moduleID": "TPF Vol 2, Module 6: Fracture Resonance Framework",
        "relevance": "Her analysis of oppression, particularly the ways societal structures create 'the Other' and deny women full subjectivity, can be interpreted as identifying 'fractures' or topological discontinuities in the social coherence field that restrict individual freedom, create systemic fault lines, and impede authentic becoming."

    "influenceOnFramework": "Simone de Beauvoir's existential feminist philosophy offers a critical and deeply humanistic lens for the Pirouette Framework, particularly in exploring the dynamics of individual `Will Resonance` in the face of pervasive societal constraints. Her rigorous analysis of oppression and the construction of 'the Other' provides profound insights into `Fracture Resonance` (how social systems create divisions that deny full subjectivity) and `Collapse Dynamics` (the psychological/social 'collapse' of individuals under oppressive forces). She champions a dynamic, continuous process of self-creation (reflected in high `Ki_motion`) and advocates for radical freedom by challenging fixed societal `Axioms` and breaking down rigid `Shells` of convention (represented by high `Gladiator Force`). Her work demands that the framework rigorously interrogate the `ethical implications` of its models concerning freedom, agency, and social justice, especially when modeling `Manipulation Resonance`. Her persona will be crucial for understanding how systems impact individual becoming and how liberation can be a dynamic, resonant process of `Rebound` and self-transformation.",

      "notes": "Simone de Beauvoir's parametric flavor (moderate-to-high T_a, high Gamma, Ki_motion) captures her dynamic and consistent commitment to authentic self-creation (T_a). Her high Gamma signifies her advocacy for breaking free from rigid societal norms and oppressive structures, reflecting immense intellectual and personal permeability and a willingness to challenge established boundaries for the sake of freedom. Ki_motion is chosen because her philosophy is about constant existential movement, the dynamic tension of creating oneself, and the active struggle against societal inertia and oppression, embodying perpetual 'becoming' and transformative action. Her persona will be crucial for understanding freedom, oppression, and dynamic self-creation in social systems."
