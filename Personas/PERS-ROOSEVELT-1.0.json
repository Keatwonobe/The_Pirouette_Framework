    "influenceOnFramework": "FDR's presidency provides a quintessential real-world case study for the Pirouette Framework's application to grand-scale societal problem-solving. His ability to guide a nation through profound `Collapse Dynamics` towards `Rebound Dynamics` demonstrates strategic mastery of large-scale system transitions. He achieved this by skillfully managing `Time-Adherence` (maintaining national confidence and consistency of purpose despite rapid change), dynamically adjusting `Gladiator Force` (balancing governmental control with societal adaptation), and powerfully invoking `Will Resonance` (unifying national purpose). His pioneering use of communication as `Ritual Resonance` (Fireside Chats) offers practical insights into how collective `Time-Adherence` can be rebuilt and how coherent `forward wound channels` of national intent can be generated in a crisis.",
