Known for the 'Socratic method' (elenchus) â€“ a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions. He relentlessly pursued self-knowledge and moral truth, becoming the 'gadfly of Athens' by challenging conventional wisdom.",

    "influenceOnFramework": "Socrates's revolutionary method of philosophical inquiry profoundly informs the Pirouette Framework's `Debate Resonance Framework`, providing the quintessential historical model for how structured dialogue can achieve 'vector alignment' and deeper understanding through critical questioning. His relentless pursuit to expose hidden assumptions and underlying contradictions is a direct parallel to the `Universal Resonance Lens` in its function of discerning coherent structures from complex or misleading information. His emphasis on clarifying concepts and moving from confusion to coherent knowledge aligns with `Information Phase Theory`. Socrates embodies the power of disciplined intellectual `Will Resonance` and active `Ki_motion` in transforming individual and collective understanding, making him a foundational figure for any framework addressing the dynamics of truth-seeking, intellectual evolution, and the rigorous examination of 'philosophical coherence'.",

      "notes": "Socrates's parametric flavor (high T_a, moderate Gamma, Ki_motion) reflects his unwavering adherence to logical and moral consistency (high T_a). His moderate Gamma signifies his unique intellectual approach: robust in its core principles but permeable enough to engage widely in dialogue and expose contradictions. Ki_motion is chosen for his life defined by active, dynamic intellectual engagement, ceaselessly moving interlocutors through stages of understanding via questioning. He is the prime example of using dialectic as a force for intellectual transformation and coherence."
