    "coreContribution": "Articulated and practiced Stoic philosophy as a Roman Emperor, advocating a life governed by reason, virtue, and duty. His private reflections, 'Meditations,' offer timeless insights into resilience, self-mastery, and the acceptance of external events while maintaining internal tranquility. He exemplified the application of profound philosophical principles to practical leadership.",

        "moduleID": "TPF Vol 3, Module 8: Will Resonance Framework",
        "relevance": "His core practice of directing one's inner attention and discipline towards virtue and duty is a perfect embodiment of 'Will' as an active, self-generated coherence field that shapes an entity's actions and reality engagement."

        "moduleID": "TPF Vol 2, Module 3: Rebound Dynamics Framework",
        "relevance": "His philosophy offers a robust framework for responding to adversity. Stoic principles for accepting what cannot be changed while focusing on what can be controlled, and building internal fortitude, directly align with achieving 'Adaptive' or 'Transformative Rebound' after perturbations."

    "influenceOnFramework": "Marcus Aurelius's philosophical system provides a profound historical blueprint for applying principles of internal coherence and disciplined interaction with external realities. His emphasis on cultivating a robust internal state (high `Time-Adherence`) and maintaining disciplined boundaries against emotional or chaotic influences (low `Gladiator Force`) directly informs the Pirouette Framework's understanding of `Will Resonance` and `Shell Resonance` as mechanisms for personal and systemic integrity. His leadership during times of plague and war, guided by Stoic principles, serves as a powerful case study for `Rebound Dynamics`, demonstrating how a system can not only recover from collapse but also transform through principled action, making him an embodiment of the 'Philosophy' vector in the `Triaxial Foundation` applied to the self and governance.",
