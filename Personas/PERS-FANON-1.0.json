    "coreContribution": "A Martinican psychiatrist, philosopher, revolutionary, and political theorist. His work profoundly analyzed the psychological and social impacts of colonialism and racism, the dynamics of decolonization, and the struggle for liberation. He explored how oppression distorts identity, leads to violence (both physical and psychological), and outlined the path to authentic selfhood for the colonized, advocating for radical transformation.",

    "influenceOnFramework": "Frantz Fanon's seminal work offers a crucial philosophical and psychological lens for the Pirouette Framework, particularly enriching `Collapse Dynamics` and `Fracture Resonance` by analyzing how oppressive systems induce systemic breakdown and fragmentation within individuals and societies. His insights into the psychological violence of colonialism illuminate the devastating effects of `Manipulation Resonance` on identity and 'will.' He profoundly informs `Rebound Dynamics` by theorizing the process of decolonization as a struggle towards authentic `Will Resonance` and collective self-determination. His emphasis on dynamic, transformative liberation (reflected in high `Ki_motion`) and the necessity of breaking rigid oppressive boundaries (manifested in high `Gladiator Force`) challenges the framework to fully engage with the dynamics of power, oppression, and revolutionary societal change, especially within `social and cognitive justice` contexts. His persona will be vital for understanding fragmented identities and the transformative potential of liberation struggles.",

      "notes": "Frantz Fanon's parametric flavor (moderate T_a, high Gamma, Ki_motion) reflects his analysis of fragmented identities under oppression (moderate T_a, where coherence is disrupted) and his advocacy for breaking violent, rigid colonial boundaries (high Gamma). Ki_motion is chosen because his philosophy is fundamentally about dynamic struggle, revolutionary transformation, and the active process of decolonization towards self-determination. His persona brings a critical perspective on how systems impose 'fractures' and how suppressed 'will' can generate immense transformative energy."
