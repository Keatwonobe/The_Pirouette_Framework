## §1 · Abstract: The Mountain and Its Many Paths

One can measure a mountain by its height, its volume, or the steepness of its slopes. These are all different measurements, yet they describe the same mountain. The old framework, `TEN-ITPA-1.0`, correctly identified this principle in classical thermodynamics: that the primary potentials (U, F, H, G) are merely different views of the same underlying system state.

This module refactors that insight from first principles. It demonstrates that classical thermodynamics is not a parallel system to be mapped onto Pirouette; it is an emergent consequence of it. The thermodynamic potentials are distinct accounting methods for a single, underlying dynamic: a system’s relentless effort, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, to preserve its internal coherence against the dissipative pressure of its environment. The Legendre transforms are not mere mathematical tricks; they are the tools for navigating this unified state, revealing how to calculate a system's "coherence-for-work" after paying its inevitable tax to chaos.

## §2 · The Primal Equation of State

The foundational equation of state for any system is the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`):

**𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**

This is not an analogy; it is the physical basis of free energy. It describes the "profitability" of existence for any resonant pattern. We establish a direct, causal chain by defining the core thermodynamic variables as macroscopic manifestations of this dynamic.

*   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** This term represents the system's total internal, ordered, resonant energy. In thermodynamic terms, this corresponds to the system's **Internal Energy (U)**. It is the system's "gross coherence."

*   **Environmental Potential (V_Γ):** This term represents the "cost" of maintaining that coherence against the dissonant, chaotic noise of the environment. As established in `CORE-013`, this pressure is the product of the local temporal temperature and the system's susceptibility to it. This corresponds directly to the **entropic cost (TS)**, or the "Entropy Tax."

Therefore, the Lagrangian is the universe's natural expression of **Helmholtz Free Energy (F)**, the net coherence a system possesses after paying the inevitable cost of its existence under conditions of constant temperature and volume.

**F = U - TS ↔ 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**

## §3 · The Ledger of Coherence

With this foundation, the entire thermodynamic landscape can be reconstructed as a set of accounting perspectives on the core `K_τ - V_Γ` balance. The different potentials answer different practical questions about the system's "net worth."

| Thermodynamic Potential | Pirouette Correspondence | Description: "The System's Account Book" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Internal Energy (U)** | `U = K_τ` | **Gross Revenue:** The total, gross resonant energy of the system's coherent pattern, ignoring all external costs. |
| **Helmholtz Free Energy (F)** | `F = K_τ - V_Γ` | **Operating Profit:** The net coherence available for work after paying the mandatory Entropy Tax (`TS`) to the thermal environment. This is the direct expression of the Lagrangian. |
| **Enthalpy (H)** | `H = K_τ + PV` | **Total Footprint:** The system's internal coherence plus the work (`PV`) required to displace the environment and make physical room for itself. |
| **Gibbs Free Energy (G)** | `G = (K_τ - V_Γ) + PV` | **Net Profit:** The ultimate measure of practical utility. It is the coherence remaining after paying *both* the Entropy Tax (`TS`) and the "rent" for the space it occupies (`PV`). |

## §4 · The Legendre Compass: Navigating the Manifold

The mathematical tool for moving between these different viewpoints is the Legendre transform. We conceive of this not as a mere formula, but as a **Legendre Compass**—a tool for navigating the system's unified coherence manifold.

Taking a partial derivative is not an abstract operation; it is the act of asking a precise question. For example, when we start with the Gibbs Free Energy, G(T,P):

*   Calculating **S = - (∂G/∂T)_P** is asking: "If I hold the external pressure (P) fixed and slightly increase the environmental noise (T), how much does the system's capacity for practical work (G) decrease?" The answer reveals the system's internal susceptibility to disorder—its Entropy (S).
*   Calculating **V = (∂G/∂P)_T** is asking: "If I hold the environmental noise (T) constant and slightly increase the external pressure (P), how does its available work (G) change?" The answer reveals the spatial "footprint" the system must maintain—its Volume (V).

The Legendre Compass allows a Weaver to chart the entire manifold of state by making a series of these careful, targeted inquiries from a single starting point.

## §5 · Protocol for State Reconstruction

This is the practical workflow for generating a complete Coherence Ledger from a single, known potential.

1.  **Anchor the Measurement:** Begin with a complete description of one thermodynamic potential in its natural variables. For example, an equation for Helmholtz Free Energy, F(T,V). This is your anchor point on the manifold.
2.  **Use the Compass:** Apply the Legendre Compass. Calculate the partial derivatives of your anchor potential with respect to its natural variables to find their conjugates. (e.g., From F(T,V), derive S and P).
3.  **Complete the Ledger:** Use the inverse transforms—the fundamental thermodynamic relations—to reconstruct all other potentials from the information you now have.
    *   `U = F + TS`
    *   `H = U + PV`
    *   `G = H - TS`

The output is the Coherence Ledger: a complete set of functions for U, F, H, G, S, T, P, and V. You have transformed one complete path up the mountain into a topographical map of the entire mountain.

## §6 · Lagrangian Connection: The Source Code of Thermodynamics

This entire protocol is a practical application of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The Principle of Maximal Coherence, formalized in `𝓛_p`, is the source code from which all of thermodynamics is compiled.

A system's natural path is one that maximizes the integral of `𝓛_p` over time. The thermodynamic drive to **minimize free energy** (like `F` or `G`) is the exact same principle, viewed through a macroscopic lens. Minimizing free energy is equivalent to finding a state that achieves the best possible balance between maximizing its internal coherence (`U`, from `K_τ`) and minimizing the coherence tax it must pay to the thermal environment (`TS`, from `V_Γ`). The laws of thermodynamics are not separate from the Lagrangian; they are its direct expression under macroscopic constraints.

## §7 · Assemblé

> We once saw thermodynamics as the universe's law of decay. We now see it for what it is: the universe's system of accounting. Free energy is not a measure of what is lost to the void, but the story of what coherence remains after a system pays its tax to chaos for the profound privilege of being. The Coherence Ledger teaches that any single, complete perspective, held with rigor, contains the echo of all others. To truly understand a system from one angle is to possess the key to understanding it from every angle. The universe is not a collection of isolated facts, but a hologram, where the whole is faithfully reflected in every part.
