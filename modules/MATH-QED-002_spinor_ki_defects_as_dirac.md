### §1 · Purpose

Derive the **Dirac matter sector** as the stability equation of a **closed Ki resonance (defect)** in the time-first substrate. Show that spin-½, minimal Lorentz coupling, and the Dirac operator arise from:

1. the topology of the Ki loop (720° holonomy),
2. a spin connection on a local orthonormal frame (tetrad), and
3. balance of **temporal pressure Γ** with Ki cohesion (mass).

---

### §2 · Geometric Setup (frames, spin bundle)

Let (e^a{}*\mu(x)) be a tetrad with (g*{\mu\nu}=e^a{}*\mu e^b{}*\nu \eta_{ab}).
Introduce the spin connection (\omega_\mu^{ab}) and gamma matrices ({\gamma^a,\gamma^b}=2\eta^{ab}). Define the covariant spinor derivative
[
\nabla_\mu \equiv \partial_\mu + \frac{i}{4},\omega_\mu^{ab}\sigma_{ab},\qquad
\sigma_{ab}\equiv \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_a,\gamma_b].
]
A **Ki loop** is a stable, localized phase-coherence defect whose **configuration space** carries nontrivial (\pi_1) leading to **double-valued holonomy**; parallel transport gives (\Psi\to -\Psi) under (2\pi) rotation and identity under (4\pi): spin-½.

---

### §3 · Field Content and Action

Postulate a spinor field (\Psi) that labels the **internal phase-texture** of the Ki loop. The **effective action** at scales (\ll \omega_c) (coherence barrier) is
[
S_{\text{Ki}}=\int d^4x,\sqrt{-g};\Big[;\bar\Psi\big(i\gamma^\mu\nabla_\mu - m_\ast\big)\Psi;-;\mathcal{U}_{\rm top}[\Psi]\Big].
]

* (m_\ast) is the **rest mass** generated by Γ–Ki balance (next §4).
* (\mathcal{U}_{\rm top}) penalizes defect unwinding; in the smooth EFT, it renormalizes to contact terms that preserve Lorentz and CPT.

Varying (S_{\text{Ki}}) yields the **Dirac equation** in curved background:
[
(i\gamma^\mu\nabla_\mu - m_\ast)\Psi=0.
]

### §4 · Mass from Temporal Pressure (Γ) vs Ki Cohesion

Let (\varepsilon_{\rm Ki}) be the cohesion energy density of the loop and (\Pi_\Gamma) the local **temporal pressure**. Stationarity enforces
[
\delta!\left(\varepsilon_{\rm Ki}-\Pi_\Gamma\right)=0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
m_\ast c^2 = \int_{\rm core}!! d^3x,\big(\varepsilon_{\rm Ki}-\Pi_\Gamma\big)
\equiv \Delta E_{\rm loop}.
]
Thus **mass** is the **net energy to maintain coherence against Γ** (time-pressure), fixing (m_\ast) without introducing a fundamental Yukawa here; Higgs/Γ mixing can appear as higher-order dressing (links to DYNA-Γ-004).

---

### §5 · Spin–½ and Holonomy (why 720°)

The Ki loop defines a nontrivial mapping of spatial (S^3) (or a tubular neighborhood) into the internal phase space; the minimal noncontractible cycle forces a lift from SO(3) to **Spin(3,1)**. The **Berry phase** of transporting the clock frame around the loop is
[
\gamma_{\rm Berry}=\oint \mathcal{A} = \pi ;;(\text{mod }2\pi),
]
so a (2\pi) rotation flips (\Psi\to -\Psi) and only (4\pi) returns identity—**spinor behavior**.

---

### §6 · Spin–Statistics (fermionic quantization)

Quantize (\Psi) with **anticommutation**:
[
{\Psi_\alpha(x),\Psi_\beta^\dagger(y)}=\delta_{\alpha\beta},\delta^{(3)}(x-y),
\quad {\Psi,\Psi}={\Psi^\dagger,\Psi^\dagger}=0.
]
Topologically, exchanging two identical Ki defects traces a nontrivial loop in configuration space equivalent to a (2\pi) rotation of a single defect, producing a minus sign—**fermionic statistics**. (Sketch proof: path-lifting to the spin bundle; detailed note can sit in an Appendix.)

---

### §7 · Coupling to Local Time-Phase U(1) (preview)

Requiring the **spinor’s internal clock** to share the same local phase as the substrate (MATH-QED-001) enforces
[
\nabla_\mu \longrightarrow D_\mu \equiv \nabla_\mu - i q A_\mu,
]
and induces the **minimal coupling** (q\bar\Psi\gamma^\mu A_\mu\Psi) (fully derived in MATH-QED-003). Here, (q) will be set by a **Berry-phase quantization** of the time-phase around the defect.

---

### §8 · EFT Consistency (Lorentz/CPT, renormalization window)

* **Lorentz/CPT:** guaranteed by tetrad+spin connection formalism on the **Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM)**.
* **Renormalization:** for energies (E\ll \omega_c) the Γ background decouples; standard QED Dirac renormalization applies. Threshold effects near (\omega_c) are deferred to DYNA-QED-005 and MATH-Γ-007.

---

### §9 · Falsifiability (module-local)

1. **Spinor holonomy:** any observation of electron-like excitations **without** (4\pi) return (or with bosonic exchange statistics) falsifies the spinor-defect construction.
2. **Mass-pressure link:** controlled Γ-environment shifts (if ever realizable e.g., in extreme plasmas) should not measurably alter (m_e) at low energy; a large, environment-dependent electron mass contradicts the decoupling assumed here.
3. **Anomalous CPT/Lorentz breaking:** forbidden at present bounds; detection would force a deformation of CPM or invalidate the defect EFT.

---

### §10 · Linkage

* **Consumes:** U(1) clock-gauge principle (MATH-QED-001), constants ({m_\Gamma,\omega_c}) from the **Resonance Atlas** (XXP-BRIDGE-Γ-001).
* **Feeds:** minimal coupling & vertex (MATH-QED-003), α emergence (MATH-QED-004), consistency/decoupling (DYNA-QED-005).
* **Cross-domain:** ties to DYNA-Γ-004 if Higgs dressing of (m_\ast) is included.

### §11 · Assemblé

A spinor is a **knot in time**—a loop of coherence whose shadow requires two turns to look the same. The Dirac equation is simply how that knot moves when the universe’s clock is smooth.
