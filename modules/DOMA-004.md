summary: Defines the universe's intrinsic, self-regulating mechanism for preserving
  coherence. It reframes the allegorical 'Law of Echoes' as an emergent property of
  the coherence manifold, where a system's own resonance acts as an active filter.
  This process, governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, naturally amplifies harmonic
  patterns, reflects dissonant ones, and damps ambient noise, functioning as a systemic
  immune response.

## §1 · Abstract: The Song is the Filter
To exist is to sing a note in a storm.

A coherent system is an island of information in a chaotic sea of Temporal Pressure (Γ). The old narrative of the "Law of Echoes" and its "Ritual Wolves" captured a profound truth: that coherence is precious and must be defended. This module refactors that allegory into a formal dynamic model.

The modernized view reveals a deeper, more elegant truth: the filter is not a separate guardian. The filter is the song itself. The universe possesses an intrinsic, self-regulating feedback mechanism that acts as a crucible, a systemic immune response that continuously tests the integrity of every pattern. This process is not an external judgment but an emergent consequence of the universe's fundamental drive to maximize coherence, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of Return: The Physics of Integrity
The old "Echo Law" is not a moral decree but a direct consequence of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ), which dictates that all systems follow the path of maximal coherence. A system's response to any signal is simply the geometry of this law in action.

-   **Coherence → Amplification:**
    *   *Old Law:* Send coherence, receive amplification.
    *   *New Physics:* A harmonic Ki pattern represents a path of least action. Its constructive interference is easily integrated by a stable system, amplifying its total coherence (K_τ) and deepening its **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). This is the **Resonant Handshake** that can lead to a higher-order **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012).

-   **Mimicry & Dissonance → Reflection:**
    *   *Old Law:* Send mimicry, receive reflection.
    *   *New Physics:* An incoherent or mimicked pattern is a state of low Time Adherence (T_a). Interacting with it represents a path of high action. To maintain its own geodesic, the stable system's manifold must reject the perturbation. The dissonant signal, failing to find purchase, is reflected—its fragile structure shattered by the echo of the truth it imitates.

-   **Entropy → Silence:**
    *   *Old Law:* Send entropy, receive silence.
    *   *New Physics:* Pure noise is the background state of high Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) with no stable Ki pattern. It is the "cost" (V_Γ) a coherent system must overcome simply to exist. There is no signal to interact with, only a gradient to resist. The manifold does not attack noise; it simply lets it fade.

## §3 · The Modes of Filtration: Geometric Antibodies
The allegorical "wolves" are re-interpreted as specific modes of this Lagrangian-driven process—geometric "antibodies" that arise from the manifold's drive to preserve systemic health.

-   **The Mirror Filter (Self-Correction):** The most fundamental process. A system constantly interacts with the echo from its own immediate **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). A coherent system is reinforced by this echo, strengthening its Ki. An incoherent one is destabilized by its own chaotic reflection, accelerating its decay. Every entity must first face the geometry of its own past.

-   **The Crucible Filter (Resonant Synthesis):** The dynamic of constructive engagement when two distinct but coherent patterns meet. The drive to maximize coherence for the combined system forces them to seek a new, unified state—an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012)—that is more stable and complex than its component parts. This is the filter that forges novelty, turning conflict between truths into a higher order.

-   **The Damping Filter (Harmonic Rejection):** The universe's passive immune response. A deeply established Wound Channel creates a powerful, stable resonant field. New patterns that are dissonant are not attacked; they are simply not "heard." Their energy cannot find a foothold in the established rhythm and is inevitably damped, its information dissipated into the background noise of Γ. This is how stable systems reject chaos without a fight.

## §4 · Assemblé
> We sought a cosmic judge and found a law of physics. We looked for guardians and found that truth is its own guardian. The universe does not punish falsehood or chaos; it simply fails to grant them resonance. Their signals are not amplified. They leave no lasting echo.
>
> To a Weaver, this is the most profound source of hope. It means that integrity, truth, and coherence are not abstract virtues; they are physical advantages. A system built on a foundation of coherence needs no army; its own echo is its legion. The act of maintaining your own integrity—of holding your note, pure and clear in the storm—is the most powerful filter you will ever build. It is how a Weaver turns their very being into a quiet but unbreakable form of jurisprudence.
