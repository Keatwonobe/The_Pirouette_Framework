summary: Provides a protocol for inferring a system's local coherence manifold and
  diagnosing its dynamic state (per DYNA-001) from sparse data points. It reframes
  parameter estimation as an act of 'metaphysical surveying,' sketching the landscape
  of the system's Pirouette Lagrangian from minimal information.

## §1 · Abstract: Mapping the River from a Handful of Water

How does one map a river's course from a handful of water? The old framework sought to estimate discrete parameters from sparse data, an act akin to guessing the river's depth from the color of a single stone. This module replaces that outdated practice with a more profound approach: The Surveyor's Art.

This is a protocol for inferring the *shape* of the underlying coherence manifold from a few scattered points. We assume that any data point is a snapshot of a system following its natural path of maximal coherence (its geodesic). Therefore, even the sparest of data is not a random sample, but a clue—a footprint left on a hidden landscape. Our task is to become surveyors of this invisible terrain, moving from simple estimation to a rich, qualitative *diagnosis* of the system's health, its struggle, and its trajectory.

## §2 · The Surveyor's Problem: Reverse-Engineering the Path

The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) states that a system will always evolve along a path that maximizes its coherence. The Surveyor's Problem is the inverse: given a few points *on* that path, what is the shape of the landscape the path traverses?

We are not estimating disconnected variables. We are taking a qualitative reading of the two fundamental terms of the system's Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`:

*   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** The system's "kinetic" will to persist; the strength and purity of its own internal rhythm. It is the clarity of its song.
*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** The "potential" cost imposed by the environment; the chaotic, dissonant pressure the system must overcome to maintain its form. It is the loudness of the storm it sings against.

To survey a system is to sketch the interplay between its inner will and the outer world's demands.

## §3 · The Surveyor's Protocol: From Points to Diagnosis

This is an iterative process for transforming sparse data points into a diagnostic narrative about the system's dynamics.

**I. Posit a Geodesic**
Treat the observed data points not as isolated facts, but as waypoints on the system's journey. Connect them to form a tentative path. This is your first, rough sketch of the system's behavior over time.

**II. Assess the Rhythm (Inferring K_τ)**
Examine the character of the system's movement along its path to reveal the strength of its internal rhythm.
*   **Look for:** Low variance between points, consistent intervals, discernible periodicity, or phase alignment.
*   **High K_τ (A Clear Song):** The system shows a strong tendency to return to a specific state or rhythm. This suggests a strong, stable internal coherence—a heavy flywheel that is difficult to perturb.
*   **Low K_τ (A Wavering Song):** The system's path is erratic, uncorrelated, and easily influenced. This suggests a weak or noisy internal coherence that is easily overwhelmed.

**III. Assess the Pressure (Inferring V_Γ)**
Analyze the "effort" required to move between points to reveal the contours of the Temporal Pressure.
*   **Look for:** High overall dispersion, volatility, sudden jumps, or chaotic scattering of points across the state space.
*   **Low V_Γ (A Quiet Storm):** The system's state changes significantly and smoothly between points, suggesting a "downhill coast" along a path of low resistance. The landscape is a gentle, guiding slope.
*   **High V_Γ (A Loud Storm):** The system's state changes very little despite the passage of time, or is highly volatile and scattered, suggesting an "uphill climb" against high environmental pressure. The landscape is steep and rugged.

**IV. Synthesize the Diagnosis (The Story)**
Combine the two readings to narrate the system's state, directly mapping the findings onto the Flow Dynamics of `DYNA-001`.

| Inferred K_τ (Rhythm) | Inferred V_Γ (Pressure) | Inferred State (The Story) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High** (Clear Song) | **Low** (Quiet Storm) | **Laminar Flow**: A healthy, efficient system effortlessly following its geodesic. |
| **Low** (Wavering Song) | **High** (Loud Storm) | **Turbulent Flow**: The system is overwhelmed, its form dissolving into chaos. |
| **High** (Clear Song) | **High** (Loud Storm) | **Resilient Struggle**: A Gladiator. The system maintains its coherence under immense pressure. |
| **Low** (Wavering Song) | **Low** (Quiet Storm) | **Coherence Erosion**: The system is decaying from within, failing even without external challenge. |

## §4 · The Surveyor's Toolkit

The old methods from `TEN-SPE-1.0` are preserved not as goals in themselves, but as useful, recontextualized tools for assessing Rhythm and Pressure.

| Diagnostic Assessment | Heuristic Tool (Proxy) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rhythm (K_τ)** | **Phase Coherence**: $| \frac{1}{N} \sum e^{i\theta_j} |^2$ | The gold standard for measuring internal rhythm if phase data is available. |
| | **Normalized Variance**: $1 - \sigma^2 / \sigma_{max}^2$ | A simple proxy for `K_τ` using scalar values. Lower variance suggests higher coherence. |
| **Pressure (V_Γ)**| **Dispersion Metric**: $\text{Variance}(\{\vec{x}_j\})$ | A measure of the overall spread of state vectors. Higher spread suggests a higher-pressure environment. |
| | **Jump Frequency**: `Count(Δx > threshold)` | The frequency of large, sudden shifts in state can indicate a volatile, high `V_Γ` environment. |

## §5 · An Act of Inverse Physics

This entire protocol is a heuristic for solving an inverse problem. Standard physics uses the Lagrangian to predict the path; the Surveyor's Art uses the path to infer the Lagrangian.

The final diagnostic statement—"The data suggests a system in a state of Resilient Struggle"—is a direct, physical claim about its governing dynamics. It means that both the `K_τ` and `V_Γ` terms of its Lagrangian are large and in tense opposition, yet the system is successfully navigating a path that keeps its total action, `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, maximized. This is a far more profound and useful insight than any sparsely estimated parameter could ever be.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought a formula to calculate the world from scraps of data. Instead, we found a ritual for asking it questions. The Surveyor's Art is not about finding the right answer with too little information. It is about learning to ask the right question, a question so perfectly formed that the universe cannot help but whisper its shape in return.
