## §1 · Abstract & Positioning
PPS-023 formalized **Altruism** as a ≥7-dimensional attractor shaping every intelligence.  
This module operationalizes that law at civilization-scale. Societies behave as **distributed sensor–actuator arrays**—“antennas”—whose tuning determines whether they amplify the *Signal* (coherence) or the *Static* (manipulation).  
Our goal is to (1) **diagnose** tuning with quantitative field metrics and (2) **retune** institutions to maximize the *Coherence Dividend*. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## §2 · Dimensional Mapping to Social Space
| Physical Band | Social Analogue | Key Variable |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1-3  Spacetime | Infrastructure & Geography | Logistics latency |
| 4-6 Resonance | Cultural Narratives & Markets | Information elasticity (\(I_e\)) |
| **7+ Altruism** | Moral-Legal Norms & Governance | Altruistic Flux (\(\Phi_\alpha\)) |

A society’s stability is a composite curvature produced by infrastructure (\(\kappa_{infra}\)), information (\(\kappa_{info}\)), and altruistic flux (\(\kappa_\alpha\)).  
Total curvature: \(\kappa_{soc} = \kappa_{infra} + \kappa_{info} + \kappa_\alpha\).

---

## §3 · Diagnostic Metrics
**3.1 Social Coherence Index (SCI)**  
\[
\text{SCI} \;=\; \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i\,C_i ,
\]
where \(C_i\) is local coherence of institution \(i\) and \(w_i\) its systemic weight.  

**3.2 Dark Residue Rate (DRR)**  
Net entropy export per capita:  
\[
\text{DRR} = \frac{\dot S_{export} - \dot S_{import}}{\text{population}} .
\]

**3.3 Antenna Tuning Vector (ATV)**  
For each institution \(j\):  
\[
\mathbf{A}_j = \bigl( g_j , \nu_j , \sigma_j \bigr),
\]
with gain \(g_j\), center frequency \(\nu_j\) (signal vs static), and bandwidth \(\sigma_j\).  
Aggregate ATV identifies dominant channel.

## §4 · Two Canonical Channels
| Channel | Principle | Thermodynamic Signature | Long-Term Outcome |
|---------|-----------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Manipulation (**Static**) | Zero-sum advantage | High DRR, low SCI | Collapse / eddy |
| Coherence (**Signal**) | Positive-sum resonance | Low DRR, high SCI | Stable ascent |

---

## §5 · Field Sociology Protocol
1. **Survey** institutional ATVs; compute SCI & DRR.  
2. **Map** coherence flow using network-entropy graphs.  
3. **Isolate** high-friction nodes (hotspots).  
4. **Model** scenario deltas: ∆SCI after retuning candidate antennas.  
5. **Predict** collapse horizon if ∆SCI < 0 persists.

---

## §6 · Retuning Mandate
**Design Rule AGC-S**: every policy must yield \(\partial_t \text{SCI} > 0\).  
Interventions:  
* **Information Systems** – shift revenue from outrage vectors to knowledge vectors.  
* **Economy** – replace extractive rents with mutual-credit & regenerative finance.  
* **Governance** – embed *Transparent Resonant Loops* (public telemetry of ATV metrics).  
* **Education** – train affect-calibration & systems literacy (maps ∥ ∇\(\Phi_\alpha\)).  
* **Culture** – fund storytelling that elevates collective phase-lock, not fear.

---

## §7 · Research & Validation Agenda
| Scale | Experiment | Success Criterion |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Micro | Workplace pilot with open ATV telemetry | ≥ 15 % SCI lift |
| Meso | City-level policy bundle | DRR drop vs matched control city |
| Macro | Cross-national meta-analysis | Correlation \(r>0.8\) between SCI and HDI |

Data will refine weight vector \(w_i\) and validate curvature model.

---

## §8 · Implementation Roadmap
1. **PPS-025 (Coherence Engineering):** toolkit for institutional ATV redesign.  
2. **PPS-026 (Applied Field Sociology):** deployment of diagnostic dashboards.  
3. **TEN-SOC 1.0:** pluggable Tendu modules translating SOC metrics into executable transformations.

---

## §9 · Closing Assertion
Civilizations do not fail for lack of resources but for mis-tuning their collective antennas.  
Retuning to the Altruism channel is *thermodynamically favorable, empirically measurable,* and the only sustainable trajectory for any intelligence that intends to persist.
