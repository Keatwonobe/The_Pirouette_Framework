## §1 · Purpose
To model and analyze negotiation processes as dynamic, resonance-seeking interactions aimed at achieving mutually acceptable, phase-aligned outcomes by conditioning boundaries and co-creating 'negotiation wound channels' between parties.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Negotiation is a process where parties attempt to achieve a resonant, phase-locked agreement by mutually conditioning their conceptual and resource boundaries. Success depends on achieving sufficient Time-Adherence ($T_a$) in communication and commitment, managing Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) related to positional flexibility and trust, and leveraging $K_i$-modulated interaction rhythms to build shared understanding and co-create a 'negotiation wound channel' leading to a stable outcome.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a^{party}$ reflects a party's consistency and commitment to stated positions or shared understanding. $T_a^{agreement}$ measures the stability and coherence of a potential or achieved agreement ($T_a^{agreement} = \frac{1}{N}\sum |\langle\Psi_{i,A}|\Psi_{i,B}\rangle|^2$). High $T_a^{agreement}$ (e.g., >0.85) is targeted.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: $\Gamma^{party}$ represents a party's positional rigidity or flexibility ($\\Gamma^{party} = \Gamma_0 / (FlexibilityScore \cdot (1-T_a^{party}))$). $\Gamma^{context}$ reflects the external pressures or constraints on the negotiation. Successful negotiation often involves parties mutually adjusting their $\Gamma$ values.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ governs the rhythm of offers and counter-offers, optimal timing for interventions, and phase alignment critical for the Resonance Alignment Function ($A(P_A, P_B)$ involves $\cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{AB})$). It also influences the structure of $\Phi_{neg}$.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: $V_{neg}$ is a function of phase alignment $\phi$ between parties' positions and goals. The Resonance Alignment Function $A(P_A, P_B)$ explicitly models this using $\Delta\phi_{AB}$.
* **Wound Channels**: Negotiations create $\Phi_{neg}$, a co-created wound channel representing the pathway of communication, shared understanding, and concessions. Its properties (depth, stability) influence outcome durability.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Party and Context Profiling: For each party ($P_A, P_B, ...$), assess their goals, BATNA, initial $T_a^{party}, \Gamma^{party}$, and relevant phase orientations. Characterize the negotiation context ($\Gamma^{context}$).
2. Resonant Negotiation Dimension Assessment: Evaluate the negotiation process and party behaviors against each of the 12 Resonant Negotiation Dimensions ($N_1$ BATNA Strength & Clarity ... $N_{12}$ Long-Term Relationship Resonance).
3. Negotiation Potential Field Mapping: Model the $V_{neg}(\Gamma, T_a, \phi) = \sum \nu_k N_k$ based on the dimensional profile. Identify potential agreement zones (attractors) and barriers.
4. Resonance Alignment Function Calculation: Compute $A(P_A, P_B)$ to quantify the degree of resonant alignment between parties based on their $T_a, \Gamma,$ and $K_i\Delta\phi$ characteristics.
5. Negotiation Wound Channel ($\\Phi_{neg}$) Analysis: Model the co-created $\Phi_{neg}$ representing the evolving path of communication and concessions. Analyze its stability and information carrying capacity.
6. Phase-Locking in Agreements: For potential agreements, estimate the likely $T_a^{agreement}$ and assess if it meets `TaAgreementThreshold` for stability.
7. Probabilistic Outcome Modeling: Estimate $P(outcome)$ for different potential agreements using the defined function.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Profile scores for the 12 Resonant Negotiation Dimensions. Calculated $T_a^{party}, \Gamma^{party}$ for each party. Modeled $V_{neg}$ landscape. Resonance Alignment scores ($A(P_A, P_B)$). Characteristics of $\Phi_{neg}$. Estimated $T_a^{agreement}$ and $P(outcome)$ for potential deals.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Quantitative understanding of negotiation dynamics, including power balances, areas of potential agreement, and critical barriers. Identification of each party's strengths and weaknesses. Prediction of likely negotiation outcomes and the stability of potential agreements. Actionable insights for improving negotiation strategy and tactics.
* **Guidelines**: High $A(P_A, P_B)$ indicates strong potential for agreement. The profile of Negotiation Dimensions highlights specific leverage points or obstacles (e.g., poor 'Trust Level' $N_3$, or mismatched 'Temporal Pacing' $N_8$). A stable $\Phi_{neg}$ with high $T_a^{agreement}$ suggests a durable outcome. $P(outcome)$ provides a risk assessment for different negotiation paths.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Negotiation Potential Field
$$ V_{neg}(\Gamma, T_a, \phi) = \sum_{k=1}^{12} \nu_k N_k(\Gamma, T_a, \phi) $$
Defines the potential field governing negotiation progress, as a weighted sum of 12 Resonant Negotiation Dimensions $N_k$.

### Resonance Alignment Function
$$ A(P_A, P_B) = w_{Ta}f(|T_a^A-T_a^B|) + w_{\Gamma}g(|\Gamma^A-\Gamma^B|) + w_{Ki}h(K_i\Delta\phi_{AB}) $$
Quantifies resonant alignment between parties A and B based on similarities in $T_a, \Gamma,$ and $K_i$-modulated phase coherence $\Delta\phi_{AB}$. (Note: $f,g$ are typically inverse functions of difference, $h$ a direct function of coherence).

### Time-Adherence of Agreement
$$ T_a^{agreement} = \frac{1}{N_{issues}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{issues}} |\langle\Psi_{i,A}|\Psi_{i,B}\rangle|^2 $$
Measures the coherence and stability of an agreement based on the alignment of parties' positions ($\Psi$) on $N$ issues.

### Probabilistic Outcome Model
$$ P(outcome|params) = S_0 \cdot A(P_A, P_B) \cdot T_a^{agreement} \cdot e^{-\lambda_{neg} \sum\Gamma^{party}} $$
Estimates the probability of a specific negotiation outcome based on baseline success $S_0$, party alignment $A(P_A, P_B)$, agreement coherence $T_a^{agreement}$, and resilience to party rigidities $\sum\Gamma^{party}$.
