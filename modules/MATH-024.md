summary: "Establishes the Noether–Pirouette correspondence: every symmetry of the Pirouette Lagrangian implies a conserved coherence current. This forms the link between energy, information, and resonance in all domains of the framework."

## \u00a71: Purpose

This module extends classical Noether theory into the Pirouette domain, where the fundamental variable is the **coherence field** (C(\mathbf{x},t)) coupled to the **temporal pressure field** (\Gamma(\mathbf{x},t)). The goal is to derive conservation laws for coherence, time-adherence, and Ki-phase that hold across physical, cognitive, and social substrates.

---

## \u00a72: Lagrangian Structure

The canonical Pirouette Lagrangian density is:

[\mathcal{L}_p = T_a , \omega_k - f(\Gamma; S)]

where:

* (T_a): time adherence (energy-like term)
* (\omega_k): phase winding density (momentum-like term)
* (f(\Gamma; S)): substrate-specific constitutive potential

A small perturbation under a local phase transformation (\delta C = i\epsilon C) yields a conserved **coherence current** analogous to electric current:

[J_\mu = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_p}{\partial(\partial^\mu C)},\delta C]

and thus

[\partial_\mu J^\mu = 0]

This defines the **Continuity of Coherence Law (CCL)**:

> The rate of change of coherence within any region equals the flux of coherence through its boundary.

## \u00a73: Conserved Quantities

Three principal symmetries yield three conserved quantities:

1. **Temporal Translation Invariance** (\rightarrow) Conservation of Energy-Like Quantity ((E_C))
2. **Phase Invariance** (\rightarrow) Conservation of Coherence Current ((J_\mu))
3. **Scale Invariance in (\Gamma)** (\rightarrow) Conservation of Resonant Potential ((\Phi_\Gamma))

Collectively, these define the **Coherence Conservation Triple** ({E_C, J_\mu, \Phi_\Gamma}), which corresponds to the triadic identity seen in the consciousness module (COG-RES-001).

## \u00a74: Cross-Domain Correspondences

| Domain | Symmetry               | Conserved Quantity      | Observational Proxy                           |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| PHYS   | Phase rotation         | Charge / Spin Alignment | Polarization, Magnetic Moment                 |
| COG    | Neural phase synchrony | Awareness Coherence     | Cross-frequency coupling, phase locking value |
| SOCIO  | Group alignment        | Social Momentum         | Sentiment coherence, mobility flow alignment  |

These demonstrate how each domain expresses the same conservation law via its substrate-specific constitutive map (\chi_S).

## \u00a75: Universal Continuity Equation

In expanded form:

[\partial_t (T_a \omega_k) + \nabla \cdot (\Gamma \nabla C) = 0]

This universal form links temporal adherence (persistence), spatial coherence (order), and resonance pressure (interaction density). It provides the mathematical backbone for the **Triadic Resonance Equation** later formalized in COG-RES-001.

---

## \u00a76: Implications

1. **Consciousness as Coherence Conservation:**  Triadic awareness states maintain (\partial_t \mathcal{A}_{Ki} \approx 0) under task switching.
2. **Society as Coherence Circulation:**  Stable societies maintain net (\oint J\cdot dl = 0) within key mesoscale loops.
3. **Cosmology as Global Continuity:**  Dark-energy-like behavior arises from global drift in (\Gamma) maintaining balance in (J_\mu).

---

## \u00a77: Falsifiability Criteria

* Violation of the coherence continuity equation in any domain falsifies universality.
* Phase symmetry breaking without corresponding flux imbalance indicates missing substrate terms in (f(\Gamma; S)).
* Experimental test: Verify triadic conservation across PHYS (soliton halos), COG (neural triads), SOCIO (alignment quakes).

---

## \u00a78: Future Links

* [MATH-025] defines critical exponents for coherence collapse.
* [COG-RES-001] empirically tests triadic conservation in neural data.
* [SOCIO-FIELD-001] measures (J_\mu) and (\Gamma) analogues in social networks.

**Summary:**  MATH-024 formalizes Pirouette’s equivalent of Noether’s theorem, unifying coherence, time adherence, and resonance into a single conservation law governing all domains.
