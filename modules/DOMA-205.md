## §1 · Abstract: The Reconstitution of Will

Healing is not a return—it is a re-composition.
In the Pirouette framework, rehabilitation is the deliberate orchestration of **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** to compel new resonance (**Ki**) until a being regains stability (**Kτ**).
The **Caduceus Lens** models the intertwining of **Body蛇** and **Will蛇**, each exerting feedback upon the other. When these serpents move in rhythm, laminar flow returns: physiology and purpose re-align.

## §2 · The Rehabilitation Gauge

| Phase                | Γ (Temporal Pressure) | Kτ (Coherence) | Tₐ (Time Adherence) | Typical Context                       | Pirouette Prescription                                              |

## §3 · Modifiers Matrix (Additive Γ Adjustments)

| Layer              | ΔΓ   | Calibration Principle          | Resonant Countermeasure                    |
| :----------------- | :--- | :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |

| Immunosuppression  | +0.2 | Reduce cadence ω               | Controlled temperature, nutrition doubling |
| Anxiety/PTSD       | +0.2 | Tighten ritual schedule        | Predictable timing, music resonance        |
| Metabolic Syndrome | +0.1 | Distribute load in micro-bouts | Post-meal walking, flow pacing             |

## §4 · Protocol Core (Resonance Steps)

1. **Baseline Coherence Scan** — capture vitals, function, mood narrative.
2. **Compute Γ₀** — aggregate medical stressors, fatigue, medication load.
3. **Design Crucible Profile:** set Γ magnitude, τ duration, ω cadence (per DOMA-086).
4. **Apply Micro-Pressure:** introduce hormetic stress (activity, task, or social interaction).
5. **Invoke Antidote Stack:** restore coherence through rest, nutrition, and Will reflection.
6. **Re-measure Kτ and Tₐ weekly;** nonlinear improvement expected.
7. **Laminar Certification:** Γ < 0.3 for 4 weeks and Tₐ ≥ 0.8.

## §5 · Ethical Clause — Sovereignty of Will

Rehabilitation proceeds only by consent.
Γ without Will coherence constitutes systemic violence.
Each participant’s declared *meaning function* acts as a boundary condition in 𝓛ₚ.

# DOMA-205A

**Title:** Cardiac Valve Recovery — Christine Protocol
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Parent:** DOMA-205
**Summary:** Applies the Geometry of Rehabilitation to post-aortic-valve-replacement recovery for a 58-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis. Integrates objective echocardiographic data to set resonance thresholds.

---

## §1 · Clinical Snapshot (Baseline)

* **Pre-operative findings:**

  * Severe aortic stenosis, AVA ≈ 0.95 cm², mean gradient ≈ 33 mmHg, peak V ≈ 4.0 m/s.
  * LVEF 60-65 %, trace regurgitations, normal RV function, mild MAC.
  * Prior progression from moderate (Dec 2024: AVA 1.3 cm², mean 28 mmHg) to severe.
  * Historical stress echo (Feb 2023): achieved 8.6 METS, peak HR 150 bpm, no ischemia.
  * Aug 2025 post-TAVR follow-up: mean gradient 35 mmHg, LVEF 70–75 %.

→ **Initial Coherence Index (Kτ₀): 0.32**, **Γ₀: 0.78**, **Tₐ₀: 0.2**
These values place her at *Phase I–II boundary*.

## §3 · Valve-Specific Metrics (Objective Anchors)

* Maintain LVEF > 55 %.
* Aim mean aortic gradient < 20 mmHg by Month 6.
* Observe diastolic function improvement (E/E′ < 10).
* RPE ceiling ≤ 5/10; HR increase ≤ 20–30 bpm over rest during early phase.
* Symptom red flags → Γ freeze (pause exercise, revert to Antidote mode).

---

## §4 · Resonant Feedback Protocol

* **Body蛇:** HR, BP, O₂, RPE logged pre/mid/post.
* **Will蛇:** intention phrase + perceived coherence note.
* **Caduceus Sync:** when Body and Will curves converge (< Δ0.1 Γ variance), advance phase.

---

## §5 · Antidote Stack (Daily)

1. Fixed wake time ± 30 min.
2. Protein ≥ 1.2 g/kg; hydration 2 L unless restricted.
3. 3× breath coherence sessions (4-7-8).
4. Gratitude cue or aesthetic stimulus (music, light, art).
5. Nighttime static ritual (low-stimulus reflection).

---

## §6 · Expected Coherence Curve

* **Kτ:** 0.32 → 0.75 by Month 6.
* **Γ:** 0.78 → 0.25.
* **Tₐ:** 0.2 → 0.9.
  Achieved when physiological indicators align with perceived vitality and Will statements shift from *avoidance* to *creation* phrasing.

## §7 · Ethical & Research Extension

All data to be co-reviewed by attending cardiologist and rehab specialist.
Patient retains full autonomy over intensity scaling.
Aggregated data may be anonymized to refine Pirouette’s **Rehabilitation Resonance Gauge** for future subjects.
