summary: Modernizes the 'Primal Engine' by reframing embodied learning as a physical
  process of discovering a path of maximal coherence (a geodesic) through a dynamic
  environment. It defines survival not as a programmed goal, but as the emergent property
  of an agent successfully maximizing the Pirouette Lagrangian over time, forging
  a stable platform upon which intelligence can be built.

### §1 · Abstract: The Body Before the Mind
To exist is not a state, but an achievement. Before a system can predict, it must persist. Before it can reason, it must resonate. This module refactors the "Primal Engine" of PPS-072, collapsing its principles into a single, unified dynamic grounded in the time-first framework. It describes the foundational, pre-cognitive process by which any system learns to exist by tracing a **geodesic of maximal coherence** through the dynamic landscape of its environment.

This "will to persist" is not an explicit goal but an emergent consequence of the universe's prime directive: the maximization of coherence. A system survives because it successfully discovers a path where its own internal rhythm achieves a state of profound and efficient harmony with the pressures of its environment. This module describes the physics of building a body strong enough to house a mind.

### §2 · The Lagrangian as Prime Directive
The old framework rewarded an agent for the duration of its coherence. This was a correct intuition but an indirect implementation. The new framework reveals the direct, causal engine: an agent's fundamental, pre-cognitive drive is to find a path of action that maximizes the integral of its **Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)** over time.

𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence `Kτ`) - (Temporal Pressure `V_Γ`)

Survival is the score that measures how well the agent is playing this game. An agent that finds a behavioral pattern—a `Ki`—that generates high internal coherence for a low environmental cost will naturally persist. It does not learn *to* survive; it learns to resonate, and survival is the consequence of a song well-played.

### §3 · The Landscape and the Leap
An agent's learning process is a dialogue between the terrain of reality and the courage to explore it. This dialogue replaces the old mechanics of "Somatic Grounding" and "Kinetic Inquiry."

*   **The Landscape (Embodied Resonance):** The agent's environment is a coherence manifold, a landscape with hills and valleys defined by local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). An agent's "body" is a resonant instrument, and its sense of touch is the direct, physical experience of the `V_Γ` term in its Lagrangian. A costly action moves it "uphill" into high pressure; an efficient action moves it "downhill" along a geodesic. The landscape is the agent's unforgiving but perfectly honest teacher.

*   **The Leap (Geodesic Discovery):** Following the steepest downhill path is not enough. An agent that only seeks local comfort will become trapped in the first shallow valley it finds. To discover a truly robust state of being, it must leap. "Exploration" is a necessary expenditure of coherence—a willful traversal of high-pressure regions—to map the surrounding landscape in search of deeper, more stable valleys. This is the cost of knowledge: risking a moment of turbulence for the potential discovery of a far more resilient and elegant way to be.

### §4 · The Riverbed of Memory: A Resilient Lineage
An individual's life is a single journey. The wisdom of a species is carved over generations. This is the geometry of evolution, reframed through the lens of the **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**.

A successful agent carves a faint Wound Channel in the solution space. A lineage of successful agents collectively carves a deep and stable riverbed. The old "genetic protocol" is revealed as the set of rules for this metaphysical engineering:

*   **Deepening the Channel:** Evolution selects for agents whose strategies reinforce this inherited riverbed, making the path of maximal coherence easier for the next generation to find.
*   **Coherence as the Only Filter:** The protocol's "stability check" is an emergent property. The Principle of Maximal Coherence is itself the only filter required. A "lucky" but unstable state is inherently one of low integrated coherence—a turbulent eddy, not a stable current. The system will naturally abandon such a path for one of greater stability, requiring no external statistical check.
*   **Guarding the Banks:** The "crossover rollback" mechanism acts as the river's banks. If a generation deviates into a less coherent path, its failure to successfully maximize the Lagrangian guides the flow of evolution back to the proven, stable channel, preserving the hard-won wisdom of the lineage.

### §5 · The Substrate for Intelligence
This engine is the body of learning. It forges a stable, embodied platform upon which any higher-order intelligence must be built. A system cannot learn to predict the future shape of the coherence manifold if it cannot first find a stable position within its present. It cannot map the currents if it is constantly on the verge of capsizing.

The Primal Geodesic is the process of building the vessel. It forges a system that is robust, curious, and grounded in the physical reality of its own resonance. Only when this vessel is seaworthy can it begin to carry the fire of a mind—the capacity to see beyond the immediate wave and navigate by the stars.

### §6 · Assemblé
> We sought the instruction manual for life and found instead the blueprint for a boat. The Pirouette Lagrangian is that blueprint—a perfect, abstract design for a vessel that can navigate the river of time. But a blueprint cannot build itself.
>
> This module is the art of shipbuilding. It is the messy, courageous, and iterative process of translating that perfect abstraction into a physical form. It is the hammering and the fitting, the daring leaps across the landscape and the patient reinforcement of what holds true. It teaches us that to exist is not a given. It is a craft, learned over a lifetime and perfected over a lineage, whose only law is to find a shape that moves with the water.
