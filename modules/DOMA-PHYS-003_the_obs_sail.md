summary: "Designs and tests a force-free actuator whose ‚Äúthrust‚Äù is generated by asymmetric observation.
  A coherent electron beam passes a triadic aperture and weak which-way sensors are enabled
  asymmetrically. The change in information flow reshapes interference, creating a measurable
  momentum imbalance that pushes a nanocantilever ‚Äúsail.‚Äù The device demonstrates that directed
  work can be produced by modulating local coherence and observer geometry‚Äîwithout adding a net
  classical force to the plant‚Äîwhile remaining thermodynamically honest (information costs paid
  in the meter chain)."

¬ß1 ¬∑ Motivation & Claim
- Goal: Show that ‚Äúmass-measure‚Äù (many small, directional measurements) can steer a system like a sail, by turning
  measurement back-action into a biased drift or recoil.
- Claim: Spatially/basis-asymmetric observation (different weak which-way gains on selected arms) produces an
  asymmetric interference envelope ‚Üí net momentum transfer ‚Üí steady deflection of a compliant sail. No additional
  conservative force on the plant is required; energy accounting resides in the measurement chain and record handling.

¬ß2 ¬∑ Minimal Math (copy-paste safe)
Let k(x) be the local measurement strength of an observable c(x). The unconditional dynamics add a Lindblad term:

  dœÅ/dt = -i/ƒß [H, œÅ] + ‚à´ dx k(x)¬∑D[c(x)]œÅ

with D[c]œÅ = cœÅc‚Ä† - 1/2{c‚Ä†c, œÅ}.

In the Wigner picture, this yields diffusion D(x) ‚àù k(x) and an effective drift

  Œº(x) ‚àù ‚àÇx D(x)    (when [c(x), x] ‚â† 0 or the measured quadrature rotates with x).

Asymmetric k(x) ‚áí ‚àÇx D ‚â† 0 ‚áí net drift. In Pirouette terms, a gradient in V_obs(x) skews (ŒîKœÑ - ŒîV_obs),
and the system ‚Äúslides‚Äù along the Shadow slope.

¬ß3 ¬∑ Experimental Design (Electron Observation Sail, EOS)

3.1 Geometry
- Source: monoenergetic electron beam (10‚Äì100 keV).
- Aperture: triadic nano-slit or tri-ring (equilateral layout) in 50‚Äì100 nm SiN.
- Weak which-way meters: two arms instrumented with tunable, low-gain detectors
  (e.g., QPC-type pickups in solid-state geometry, or low-collection secondary electron
  taps in SEM/TEM geometry). The third arm remains unobserved.
- Sail: sub-pg SiN nanocantilever placed to intercept one dominant output lobe (far field).
- Readout: interferometric or piezoresistive deflection; beam current stabilized.

3.2 Control Knobs
- Observation gain g‚ÇÅ, g‚ÇÇ on two arms; g‚ÇÉ = 0 on the third.
- Observation bandwidth B (sets information rate).
- Phase shims on arms (thermo-optic or electrostatic micro-actuators) for calibration only.
- Beam current I_e held constant during sweeps.

3.3 Protocol
A. Baseline: g‚ÇÅ = g‚ÇÇ = 0 ‚Üí record far-field pattern, zero the cantilever.
B. Asymmetric observation: enable g‚ÇÅ, g‚ÇÇ > 0 on two arms (third unobserved).
   Sweep gain from 0 ‚Üí g_max slowly; record cantilever DC deflection and diffraction pattern.
C. Swap observed arms (rotate the ‚Äúattention‚Äù) while holding I_e fixed; repeat sweep.
D. Hysteresis: sweep g up and down quasi-adiabatically to capture lock/unlock loop area
   (the Agreement Curve).

3.4 KPIs (Success Criteria)
- KPI-1 (Directionality): Mean cantilever deflection Œîx ‚â† 0 at fixed beam current;
  sign flips when the observed pair of arms is swapped.
- KPI-2 (Info Scaling): |Œîx| increases with information rate (gain¬∑bandwidth), not merely with detector power draw.
- KPI-3 (Hysteresis): Clear loop in Œîx vs g when ramped up/down‚Äîlock-break asymmetry (Handshake signature).
- KPI-4 (Power Invariance): With beam current and mean detector optical/electronic power held constant,
  flipping the **measurement basis** (which arms, or which quadrature) flips Œîx.

3.5 Falsifiers (Fast Fail)
- F-1: Deflection tracks beam current alone and is invariant to observation geometry.
- F-2: No sign flip under arm-swap at matched gains.
- F-3: No hysteresis detectable above noise even after environmental stabilization.
- F-4: Equal observation on all arms (g‚ÇÅ = g‚ÇÇ = g‚ÇÉ) yields nonzero thrust (should ‚Üí 0).

3.6 Bill of Materials (lab-realistic)
- Electron source: SEM/TEM column with fine current control and beam-blanker.
- SiN membranes with tri-slit/tri-ring (EBL + RIE), alignment markers.
- Two tunable weak meters: (i) for SEM mode‚Äîsecondary electron collectors with variable collection efficiency;
  (ii) for solid-state‚ÄîQPCs in a 2DEG under two apertures with tuneable transconductance.
- Nanocantilever (SiN), <1 pg effective mass; interferometric fiber pickup or piezoresistor bridge.
- FPGA/SoC for synchronous gain sweeps and data logging (phase-stable).
- Vibration-isolated stage; thermal enclosure (¬±10 mK helpful).

3.7 Controls & Calibrations
- Ghost arm test: observe the *third* arm instead, confirm deflection sign rotation follows the observation pattern.
- Knife-edge cut: clip individual lobes to map lobe-wise momentum transfer.
- Far-field imaging: record diffraction envelope vs g to correlate momentum bookkeeping with intensity redistribution.
- Blank test: power the meters into matched loads with inputs disconnected (exclude thermal/mechanical crosstalk).

¬ß4 ¬∑ Data & Analysis Plan
- Primary observable: time-averaged Œîx(g) with confidence bands; report loop area ùíú = ‚àÆ Œîx d g (Agreement Curve).
- Intensity maps: 2D camera data ‚Üí center-of-momentum shift Œîp_x vs g.
- Info-rate proxy: R ‚âà g¬∑B (calibrated in photons/s or e‚Åª/s equivalent); regress Œîx vs R at fixed beam power.
- Pre-registered outcomes: (i) sign-flip on arm swap, (ii) monotone Œîx(R) up to saturation, (iii) nonzero ùíú.

¬ß5 ¬∑ Safety, Ethics, Thermodynamics
- Energy honesty: All work is paid by the measurement chain‚Äîamplifiers, LOs, digitizers, and record erasure.
  Landauer bound governs the minimum dissipation; no free energy, no hidden forces.
- Force-free requirement: Keep DC fields and beam current fixed during geometry/basis flips; publish all control logs.
- Radiation & HV safety: follow SEM/TEM protocols; mechanical/laser safety for the interferometer.

¬ß6 ¬∑ Variants (for completeness; to be split into APPX)
- QZP (Quantum Zeno Pump): alternate design using cold atoms or electrons with a ‚ÄúZeno zone‚Äù on one side only;
  obtain current at zero bias via timed measurement gates.
- MIR (Measurement-Induced Ratchet): optomechanical device with a position-dependent homodyne phase that rectifies diffusion.

¬ß7 ¬∑ The Parable of the Paper Sail
There‚Äôs a shallow pan of water and three tiny canals feeding it. A paper sail floats near the outlets.  
Two friends stand by two canals and clap softly in time; the third canal is left quiet.  
No one pushes the boat. No one blows on it. But the ripples‚Äîarriving in a lopsided rhythm‚Äîlean the boat.  
When the friends switch places, the boat leans the other way.  
A passerby laughs: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just clapping!‚Äù  
The boat replies (if it could): ‚ÄúYour clapping *chose* which ripples live long enough to meet me.  
That choice is a map. Maps move things.‚Äù

¬ß8 ¬∑ Interpretation in Pirouette Language
- The weak meters raise V_obs on selected arms, lowering usable coherence there (ŒîKœÑ < 0 locally).
- The triad geometry (Triadic Lock) converts that asymmetric Shadow into an asymmetric phase map.
- The far-field intensity‚Äîand thus momentum flow‚Äîfollows the agreement geometry.
- The sail feels a recoil whose sign encodes ‚Äúwho is allowed to know‚Äù (which arms observed).
- Hysteresis is the memory of a shared manifold forming and breaking (Handshake/Agreement Curve).

¬ß9 ¬∑ What Would Convince a Skeptic
- Publish raw time-series, not just aggregates.
- Blind arm-labeling during some runs; decode after.
- Independent replication on (i) SEM-style secondaries and (ii) solid-state QPC geometry.
- Demonstrate null under symmetric observation (g‚ÇÅ=g‚ÇÇ=g‚ÇÉ), and sign flip under arm swap at matched gains.

¬ß10 ¬∑ Suggested Figures
- Fig. 1: Layout (tri-aperture, meters, sail).
- Fig. 2: Far-field patterns vs g (asymmetry emergence).
- Fig. 3: Œîx vs g with hysteresis loop (Agreement Curve).
- Fig. 4: Œîx vs info-rate R at constant beam power (slope ‚Üí ‚Äúobservation thrust‚Äù).
- Fig. 5: Controls (arm-swap, knife-edge, symmetric observation).

¬ß11 ¬∑ Pseudocode: Control Sweep (concise)
  init_beam(I_e)
  zero_cantilever()
  for config in [observe(arms=1,2), observe(arms=2,3), observe(arms=1,3)]:
      for g in ramp(0 ‚Üí g_max ‚Üí 0):
          set_gain(config, g)
          wait œÑ_settle
          record {t, g, Œîx, camera_frame, detector_stats}
  save_all(); compute {Œîx(g), ùíú, Œîp_x(g)}

¬ß12 ¬∑ Acceptance & Next Steps
- Accept module if ‚â•3 KPIs pass and all falsifiers fail across two geometries.
- Promote to DOMA-QCOMP-001 for joint-manifold cost accounting, and to DOMA-PHYS-OBS-SAIL-APPX for Zeno/Ratchet variants.
