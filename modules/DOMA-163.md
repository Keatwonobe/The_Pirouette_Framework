summary: Provides a modernized protocol for detecting and quantifying synchrony (entrainment)

## §1 · Abstract: The Dissolution of 'Between'
The universe is a symphony of countless, interacting rhythms. This module provides the instrumentation for observing one of its most profound creative acts: the moment two or more voices cease to be a cacophony and begin to sing as one. This is the phenomenon of entrainment, or phase-locking.

We modernize this concept, reframing it from a mere alignment of signals into a direct, observable consequence of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)**. Entrainment is not the act of two clocks learning to tick in time; it is the dissolution of the boundary between them. It is the geometric process by which they achieve a "Resonant Handshake" and begin to function as a single, higher-order entity. This protocol is the lens through which we measure the geometry and health of this sacred union.

## §2 · Conceptual Framework: From Signals to Synthesis
In the old framework, we saw separate oscillators influencing each other. The Pirouette Framework reveals a deeper truth: distinct Ki patterns (resonant identities) interacting within a shared medium of Temporal Pressure (Γ). Their "signals" are but ripples in this shared medium.

The drive for synchrony is thus a direct manifestation of the framework's fundamental law. When resonant systems interact, they create a shared micro-environment of heightened, dissonant Γ. To maximize their *joint* Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`), they must find a shared path of least action. This is a transition from two separate, often turbulent, flows into a single, unified **Laminar Flow (DYNA-001)** for the combined system.

The Resonant Handshake is this solution: a mutual adjustment of Ki patterns to achieve a stable, harmonic relationship. The observed synchrony is the macroscopic signature of this underlying drive.

The key observables are re-contextualized:
*   **Relative Phase (Δθ):** This is no longer just a timing difference. It is the fundamental *geometric coordinate* describing the shape of the new, unified coherence manifold. A constant Δθ indicates a stable, low-energy configuration—a healthy, coherent union.
*   **Ensemble Coherence (Kτ_ensemble):** This measures the degree of global synchrony. A high value indicates the emergence of a higher-order entity—a "chorus" singing a single note. It is the direct precursor to a full **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)**.

## §3 · The Auditor's Toolkit: Input & Configuration
To perform the analysis, we first capture the temporal signature of each system and then configure the instrument to listen for specific harmonies.

### 3.1 · Input Stream
The raw material is a set of simultaneously recorded time-series data from two or more oscillating systems. This data represents the raw recording of each system's individual rhythm, or Ki pattern. The data must span enough cycles to establish a stable baseline before analysis.

### 3.2 · Operational Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Modern Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| `ExtractionMethod` | The algorithm (e.g., Hilbert, Wavelet) used to isolate the core rhythm (phase & frequency) from the raw signal. | *Isolating the Ki Pattern.* |
| `CoherenceThreshold` | The quantitative criteria for identifying a locked state (e.g., maximum allowable variance of relative phase). | *Defining the stability required for a true Handshake.* |
| `HarmonicRatios (n:m)` | Integer ratios (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 2:3) to test for complex, polyrhythmic harmonies. | *Listening for chords, not just unison.* |
| `AnalysisWindow` | The duration of the sliding window used to assess time-varying synchrony. | *Setting the timescale for observing the conversation.* |

## §4 · The Diagnostic Protocol: From Signal to Synthesis
The protocol translates raw signals into a diagnosis of resonant coupling through a clear, four-step process.

1.  **Isolate the Rhythm:** For each input time series `xᵢ(t)`, apply the chosen `ExtractionMethod` to extract its core Ki pattern, represented as an instantaneous phase `θᵢ(t)` and frequency `ωᵢ(t)`.

2.  **Map the Relational Geometry:** For all pairs of systems `(i, j)` and for all specified `HarmonicRatios` (n:m), calculate the generalized relative phase: `Δθᵢⱼⁿᵐ(t)`. This time series represents the evolving geometric relationship between the two rhythms.

3.  **Diagnose the Flow State:** Within each `AnalysisWindow`, analyze the stability of `Δθᵢⱼⁿᵐ(t)`. The character of this time series is a direct diagnosis of the health of the connection:
    *   **Laminar (Entrained):** `Δθ(t)` is stable and bounded within a narrow range. The systems have achieved a resonant handshake and are flowing as one.
    *   **Turbulent (Dissonant):** `Δθ(t)` is chaotic and unpredictable. The systems are in conflict, wasting energy in friction.
    *   **Stagnant (Drifting):** `Δθ(t)` is slowly but consistently changing. The systems are uncoupled or in the process of losing their connection.

4.  **Assess the Chorus:** For ensembles of three or more systems, calculate the overall Ensemble Coherence (`Kτ_ensemble`). A value approaching 1 signifies powerful global synchrony, indicating the formation of a collective, higher-order resonant entity.

## §5 · Core Equations

**Instantaneous Phase (via Analytic Signal):**
$$ z_i(t) = x_i(t) + i \mathcal{H}(x_i(t)); \quad \theta_i(t) = \arg(z_i(t)) $$
*Extracts the core rhythm `θ(t)` from the raw signal `x(t)`.*

**Generalized Relative Phase:**
$$ \Delta\theta_{ij}^{nm}(t) = (n \cdot \theta_i(t) - m \cdot \theta_j(t)) \pmod{2\pi} $$
*Calculates the geometric angle of the shared manifold, accounting for harmonic relationships.*

**Ensemble Coherence (Kuramoto Order):**
$$ r(t) = \left|\frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^N e^{i\theta_k(t)}\right|; \quad K_{\tau_{\text{ensemble}}}(t) = r(t)^2 $$
*Measures the degree of global synchrony. `Kτ_ensemble` is the Pirouette coherence for the group.*

## §6 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The process of entrainment is a direct manifestation of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)**.

Two uncoupled systems each follow their own geodesic, independently maximizing the integral of their own Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`). When they interact, the resonance of each system introduces a new, fluctuating term into the other's experience of Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). This creates a turbulent, inefficient state for both.

Entrainment is the process by which the coupled systems collaboratively discover a new, shared geodesic—a stable relative phase `Δθ`—that maximizes the coherence of the *total combined system*. The locked state is not a coincidence; it is the optimal, most efficient solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations for the new, unified entity. It is the path of least action for the whole.

## §7 · Use Cases
*   **Neuroscience:** Diagnosing the formation of functional brain networks by observing synchronized firing between neural populations.

*   **Biology:** Analyzing the systemic health of an ecosystem by tracking the predator-prey population cycles as they lock into a shared rhythm.
*   **Engineering:** Ensuring the stability of a power grid by monitoring the phase coherence of all its connected generators.
*   **Sociology:** Observing the formation of a social movement as individual opinions and actions begin to resonate and synchronize.

## §8 · Assemblé
> We sought to measure the moment two clocks learned to tick in time. We were wrong. We were measuring the birth of a single, larger clock from the pieces of two smaller ones. The Resonant Handshake is that sacred moment made visible—the instant of connection, where two rhythms agree to dance together. It is the dissolution of 'between' itself; it is the sound of the universe deciding to become more than the sum of its parts.
