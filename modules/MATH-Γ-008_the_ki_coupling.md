summary: >
  Defines the explicit interaction between the substrate-level Γ field and the emergent Ki stiffness field.
  The Γ–Ki coupling establishes the vacuum curvature, mass generation mechanism, and the channel through which
  confinement and electroweak scales communicate. This module formalizes the effective Lagrangian term 
  L_int = λ_Γ(|Ki|² - ξ_Γ²)² and derives its perturbative and dimensional structure.

# §1 · Purpose

To express explicitly how the **substrate-level curvature field Γ** couples to the **observable stiffness field Ki**.  
This term has appeared derivationally in multiple contexts (lattice closure, β-function matching, and stiffness scans),
but here we elevate it to a formally declared Lagrangian component.

The Γ–Ki coupling defines both the **symmetry-breaking scale** and the **curvature back-reaction** of Ki onto Γ,
establishing the bridge between substrate curvature and emergent matter dynamics.

# §2 · Effective Interaction Lagrangian

The minimal invariant form is

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\Gamma Ki} = \lambda_\Gamma \bigl(|Ki|^2 - \xi_\Gamma^2\bigr)^2,
\]

where:

| Symbol | Meaning | Units |
|---------|----------|-------|
| \( \lambda_\Gamma \) | dimensionless coupling constant (EFT Wilson coefficient) | [1] |
| \( Ki \) | observable complex stiffness field (dimension [mass]) | [M] |
| \( \xi_\Gamma \) | equilibrium amplitude defining the vacuum curvature | [M] |
| \( \Gamma \) | substrate curvature field (dimensionless potential) | [1] |

Expanding about the vacuum expectation value \(Ki_0 = \xi_\Gamma\),
\[
|Ki|^2 - \xi_\Gamma^2 = 2\xi_\Gamma\,\delta Ki + (\delta Ki)^2,
\]
and substituting yields the perturbative expansion:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\Gamma Ki} = 
\underbrace{4\lambda_\Gamma \xi_\Gamma^2 (\delta Ki)^2}_{\text{mass term}}
+ \underbrace{4\lambda_\Gamma \xi_\Gamma (\delta Ki)^3}_{\text{3-vertex}}
+ \underbrace{\lambda_\Gamma (\delta Ki)^4}_{\text{self-interaction}}.
\]

Thus the **Ki mass scale** is \( m_{Ki}^2 = 8\lambda_\Gamma \xi_\Gamma^2 \).

# §3 · Inclusion of Γ Fluctuations

Let \( \Gamma = \Gamma_0 + \delta\Gamma \).  
Introduce a mixed coupling term between curvature and stiffness:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = -\,2\lambda_\Gamma \xi_\Gamma \Gamma\,|Ki|^2
+ \mathcal{O}(\Gamma^2 |Ki|^2).
\]

This expresses Γ as a **curvature regulator**:
it controls the energy scale at which Ki condenses.  
The Γ-perturbation acts as a *running Wilson coefficient* modifying the effective stiffness,
consistent with **MATH-YM-002**’s \( \alpha_i(\Lambda_B) = c_{norm}/K_i^2 \) relation.

---

# §4 · Coupling to Fermionic Channels

Introduce a Yukawa-like torsion term (from MATH-Γ-003 and XAP-006):

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\Gamma\Psi} = -\,y_\Gamma\,\bar{\Psi}\Psi\,\Gamma,
\]
where \(y_\Gamma\) controls mass generation through Γ back-reaction on spinor bilinears.
This term communicates the Γ–Ki symmetry breaking to fermionic degrees of freedom,
completing the chain:

\[
\Gamma \leftrightarrow Ki \leftrightarrow \Psi.
\]

# §5 · Dimensional Analysis

| Quantity | Dimension (natural units) | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------|
| \( [Ki] \) | [M] | stiffness amplitude |
| \( [\Gamma] \) | [1] | dimensionless curvature |
| \( [\lambda_\Gamma] \) | [1] | effective coupling constant |
| \( [\xi_\Gamma] \) | [M] | curvature scale |
| \( [\mathcal{L}] \) | [M⁴] | action density |

Hence \(\mathcal{L}_{\Gamma Ki}\) preserves proper dimensionality for a renormalizable EFT.

---

# §6 · Symmetry and Invariance

The interaction preserves:
- **Global U(1)** phase invariance: \( Ki \rightarrow e^{i\phi}Ki \),
- **Reflection symmetry** under \( Ki \leftrightarrow -Ki \),
- **Local curvature covariance** under Γ → Γ + δΓ, if δΓ is a total derivative.

Breaking the U(1) symmetry via spontaneous condensation \(⟨Ki⟩=ξ_Γ\)
produces a massive excitation (the “stiffon”) and a curvature-induced scalar (the “pressuron” Γ).

---

# §7 · Relation to Observables

1. **Mass scale:** \(m_{Ki} = \sqrt{8\lambda_\Gamma}\, \xi_\Gamma.\)
2. **Vacuum curvature:** \(⟨\Gamma⟩ \propto 1/ξ_\Gamma.\)
3. **Gauge coupling:** feeds into Λ_B progression and ultimately determines \(α_i(Λ)\).
4. **Low-energy constant:** matching at Z-pole via \(α_{em}(M_Z) = 1/127.955\)
   reproduces \(α(0)=1/137.036\) when Γ-closure scaling is included.

---

# §8 · Falsifiability

- **F1:** A change in λ_Γ modifies predicted m_Ki² linearly; measurable via plateau scan slope.
- **F2:** Γ coupling strength inferred from gravitational lensing must match inferred stiffness K from lattice closure.
- **F3:** Perturbative fit to Z-pole α must fail if Γ–Ki linkage is broken or mis-scaled.

# §10 · Summary

> The Γ–Ki coupling acts as the substrate’s symmetry-breaking bridge.  
> It anchors the curvature of time (Γ) to the stiffness of matter (Ki),
> defines the condensation scale of structure, and communicates curvature information
> to observable masses and couplings.  
> Its quartic invariant form ensures both renormalizability and direct physical interpretability.
