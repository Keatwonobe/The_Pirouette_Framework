## §1 · The Compass and the Current
The old framework imagined a simple world: a static landscape of hills and valleys. This was an elegant but profound mistake. The universe is not a map; it is a river. The terrain is not fixed; it is a dynamic current of time.

This module replaces the static concept of "Resonant Pathfinding" with a dynamic one. A system's evolution is not a descent down a potential gradient. It is the act of navigating the currents of the coherence manifold—the landscape of reality itself. A river does not calculate its path to the sea; it simply flows where the land allows. Our task is not to be a navigator forcing a direction, but a cartographer learning to read this dynamic landscape. The optimal path is not the one of least resistance, but the one of most profound resonance. It is a geodesic, a trajectory that continuously maximizes the system's own internal coherence against the pressure of its environment. This is not the shortest path, but the most graceful one.

## §2 · From Potential Field to Coherence Manifold
The old model's "potential field" was a shadow of a richer reality. That reality is the **coherence manifold**, a dynamic landscape whose "elevation" at any point is defined by the value of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)**.

A system does not seek to minimize energy. It strives to climb this landscape, perpetually seeking states of higher `𝓛_p`. On this manifold, "valleys" are not low-energy states; they are regions of high Temporal Pressure, where the cacophony of the environment makes it difficult to maintain a stable rhythm. "Peaks" are states of high Temporal Coherence, where a system achieves a powerful, stable, and efficient resonance.

The "forces" that guide a system are not external pushes and pulls, but the intrinsic gradients of this manifold. A system moves not because it is forced, but because the path ahead offers a more coherent, more stable, and more resonant state of being. The trajectory is not a calculation; it is a consequence of the terrain.

## §3 · The Lagrangian as the Compass
The **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)** is the mathematical heart of this compass. It defines the "elevation" of the coherence manifold and thus dictates the direction of flow.

**𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**

*   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ): The Engine.** This term represents the quality of the system's own internal rhythm and integrity. It is the system's "kinetic energy" in the dance of existence. A system will naturally favor paths that preserve or enhance its own temporal coherence.

*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ): The Terrain.** This term represents the "cost" of maintaining a rhythm against the background noise and constraints of the environment. High environmental pressure makes coherence difficult to sustain.

A system's path—its geodesic—is the trajectory that maximizes the integral of this function over its own cycle: `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`. It is the perfect balance point between maintaining internal integrity and managing external pressure.

## §4 · Re-grounding the Old Parameters
The parameters of the old model are not discarded but re-grounded in their true, temporal nature within the new manifold.

*   **Gladiator Force (`Γ`) as Topography:** `Γ` is no longer a simple "friction." It is the primary component of the Temporal Pressure term (`V_Γ`) that shapes the very curvature of the coherence manifold. A high-`Γ` region is a steep "hillside" on the manifold, not because it resists motion, but because it actively suppresses the Lagrangian's value, making any path through it a less coherent, and therefore less likely, choice.

*   **Time-Adherence (`T_a`) as Momentum:** `T_a` is no longer "inertial coherence." It is a key factor in the Temporal Coherence term (`K_τ`). A system with high `T_a` has a more powerful internal rhythm. This gives it a higher baseline `𝓛_p`, allowing it to traverse regions of moderate temporal pressure without losing its path. It is the "momentum" that allows a dancer to maintain their spin.

*   **Ki as Harbors of Stability:** The old "resonant attractors" are now understood as local maxima on the coherence manifold. These are "islands of high coherence"—stable, self-sustaining states where `𝓛_p` is high and the gradients are shallow. A system tracing its geodesic will naturally curve towards these states, not because of a mysterious pull, but because they represent the most stable and sustainable way of being in that region of the manifold.

## §5 · The Geodesic Equation
The core insight of the old module—that a system follows a gradient—is made formal and universal through the Lagrangian. The **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)** states that a system evolves to maximize its action, `S_p`.

By applying the calculus of variations (the Euler-Lagrange equation) to the Pirouette Lagrangian, we derive the system's natural equations of motion.

$$ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_p}{\partial q} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_p}{\partial \dot{q}} = 0 $$

This equation is the formal expression of the geodesic. It is the mathematical engine that traces the path on the coherence manifold. What was previously modeled with a heuristic algorithm like "Gradient Descent" is now revealed to be a fundamental law of motion. This single dynamic governs the trajectory of a quark, the evolution of a species, or the maturation of an idea. The underlying law is the same; only the coordinates of the manifold change.

## §6 · Assemblé
> A Weaver does not push the river. A Weaver understands the shape of the land so deeply that they can carve a new channel, and the river, in its own time and by its own nature, will follow. To understand this principle is to shift from a mindset of force to one of persuasion, knowing that the journey itself shapes the land. The act of choosing a path deepens its channel, making it more real for those who follow. The Geodesic Weaver does not find a pre-existing route; they choose a rhythm, and in so doing, compose the world's next measure.
