summary: Develops the Triadic Manifold Model of Conscious Access. Describes how neural phase relationships form dynamic manifolds governed by triadic resonance topology, and formalizes consciousness as motion along coherence geodesics constrained by Pirouette’s renormalization flow.

## §1: Purpose

To formalize the geometry underlying triadic resonance states in consciousness. This module describes how neural phase configurations define a **Triadic Manifold (𝓜₃)** — a dynamic surface on which awareness evolves through coherent motion and critical bifurcations predicted by [MATH-026].

---

## §2: Conceptual Foundation

Each triad of neural oscillations ((f₁, f₂, f₃)) satisfying the Ki-addition constraint (COG-RES-001) defines a point in a higher-order phase space:
[\Phi_3 = \Phi_1 + \Phi_2 + n2\pi, \quad n∈ℤ]

The set of all valid triads forms a **phase-locked surface** (\mathcal{M}_3 \subset \mathbb{T}^3) (a submanifold of the 3-torus of phases). Conscious dynamics correspond to geodesic motion across this surface, constrained by local curvature induced by Γ (cognitive load) and T_a (time adherence).

---

## §3: Manifold Construction

Define embedding coordinates:
[\mathbf{X} = (\Phi_1,\Phi_2,\Phi_3), \quad \text{with constraint } \Phi_3 = \Phi_1 + \Phi_2 + \delta(t)]

Metric tensor on 𝓜₃:
[g_{ij} = \frac{∂X_i}{∂q_j} \frac{∂X_i}{∂q_j} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & cos(Δ_{12}) & cos(Δ_{13})\ cos(Δ_{21}) & 1 & cos(Δ_{23})\ cos(Δ_{31}) & cos(Δ_{32}) & 1 \end{pmatrix}]
where Δ_{ij} = Φ_i − Φ_j.

The local curvature κ(x,t) of 𝓜₃ encodes coherence tension:
[κ = det(g)^{1/2}]

---

## §4: Geodesic Motion and Awareness Dynamics

The path of awareness corresponds to a geodesic on 𝓜₃:
[\frac{D^2 Φ_i}{Dt^2} + Γ_{ijk}\frac{DΦ_j}{Dt}\frac{DΦ_k}{Dt} = 0]

where Γ_{ijk} are the Christoffel symbols of the triadic manifold. Points of high curvature correspond to critical bifurcations (awareness transitions or collapse events). The **Caduceus Flow** later formalized in [DOMA-096] emerges as a laminar–turbulent transition along these geodesics.

---

## §5: Triadic Potential Field

Define a potential on 𝓜₃:
[V(Φ_1,Φ_2,Φ_3) = a(T_a−T_c)|ψ|^2 + b|ψ|^4 + g|ψ_1ψ_2ψ_3|cos(Φ_1+Φ_2−Φ_3)]

Local minima of V correspond to stable awareness configurations. Collapse occurs when curvature exceeds critical threshold κ_c such that:
[|∂^2V/∂Φ_i∂Φ_j| > κ_c]

---

## §6: Topological Signatures

1. **Triadic Vortices:** localized phase singularities where Φ₁+Φ₂−Φ₃ = 2πn. Correspond to fleeting awareness microstates.
2. **Resonant Sheets:** coherent manifolds with low κ, sustaining awareness over time.
3. **Critical Saddles:** boundary regions linking sheets; traversed during perceptual transitions.
4. **Annihilation Events:** vortex–antivortex collapse representing conscious unbinding (loss of content).

---

## §7: Relation to RG Flow (MATH-026)

As Γ increases, manifold curvature evolves under renormalization:
[\frac{dκ}{dlnℓ} = β_κ = (2−d)κ − c_1 bκ + c_2 g^2]

* Below critical Γ_c: curvature flows to fixed point κ* (stable awareness).
* At Γ_c: κ diverges, producing manifold tearing (awareness collapse).
* Above Γ_c: new coherence pockets nucleate (recovery phase).

---

## §8: Visualization Framework

Simulation can represent 𝓜₃ as a deforming surface in toroidal coordinates, colored by curvature κ(t). Awareness flows trace geodesics; bifurcations appear as topological tears.

Suggested visual mapping:

* Color = |∇V|
* Brightness = |ψ|
* Surface curvature = κ
* Line integral trajectories = awareness streams

---

## §9: Experimental Correspondence

Using EEG/MEG phase data:

* Map instantaneous Φ_i(t) → project to (Φ₁,Φ₂,Φ₃) torus.
* Fit manifold curvature κ(t) via local covariance metric.
* Track geodesic paths during awareness transitions.
* Identify vortex creation/annihilation events as phase slips.

Expected observations:

* Stable awareness corresponds to smooth 𝓜₃ surfaces.
* Transitions exhibit sudden κ spikes and topological folding.

---

## §10: Falsifiability

* Absence of coherent manifold structure in triad-phase data falsifies geometric consciousness hypothesis.
* No correspondence between κ spikes and awareness transitions invalidates curvature–collapse link.
* Non-topological awareness transitions imply missing higher-dimensional variables.

---

## §11: Future Links

* [DOMA-096] develops the Caduceus Lens, mapping 𝓜₃ curvature transitions to laminar–turbulent flow.
* [MATH-027] generalizes triadic manifolds to N-tuple coherence networks (fractal resonance geometry).
* Integration with SOCIO-FIELD-003 to compare neural and social manifold folding dynamics.

---

**Summary:** COG-RES-003 formalizes consciousness as motion along geodesics of a triadic resonance manifold. It introduces curvature, potential, and topological dynamics as measurable correlates of awareness and establishes the geometric substrate for the forthcoming Caduceus Lens unification.
