summary: Establishes the foundational, two-channel diagnostic lens for the Pirouette
  Framework, refactoring the legacy Drift/Song protocol into a direct application
  of the Pirouette Lagrangian. It maps the Lagrangian's kinetic (Resonance) and potential
  (Pressure) terms into a practical instrument for strategic attention. This module
  defines a tiered audit standard, enabling a Weaver to move from efficient, continuous
  scanning to deep, forensic analysis with precision and purpose.

## §1 · Abstract: The Art of Strategic Attention
A full analysis of a system's dynamics requires solving its Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)—a computationally and attentionally expensive act. A Weaver's art is not just in deep analysis, but in knowing *when* and *where* to apply it. To watch everything is to see nothing.

This module provides the primary instrument for that art. It refactors the legacy "Drift/Song" protocol (PPS-080) into a modernized, mathematically-grounded standard. It establishes that the two terms of the Lagrangian are a direct blueprint for a two-channel diagnostic lens: **Pressure (P)** and **Resonance (R)**.

This lens forms the basis of a tiered audit protocol, empowering the Weaver to maintain a constant, low-cost vigil and move from the whisper of a problem to the root of its cause. It is the art of hearing the breath drawn before the note is sung.

## §2 · The Lagrangian as a Diagnostic Instrument
The state of any system is described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), which captures the fundamental interplay between external stress and internal stability. The core insight of this module is to reframe the Lagrangian not merely as a formula, but as a diagnostic instrument with two channels.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

*   **Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`)**: This "potential" term represents the energetic cost a system pays to maintain its state against environmental complexity and internal dissonance. It is the ambient stress and unresolved tension. In the Auditor's Lens, this is measured as **Pressure (P)**. It is the system's held breath; it is the *cost of being*.

*   **Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`)**: This "kinetic" term represents the quality, intensity, and stability of the system's expressed resonant solution—its Ki pattern in motion. In the Auditor's Lens, this is measured as **Resonance (R)**. It is the active, dynamic release of tension into coherent form; it is the *clarity of the system's song*.

The old "Drift/Song" vernacular is thus preserved and grounded: Drift is the building Pressure; Song is the expressed Resonance.

## §3 · The Tiered Audit Protocol
This standard formalizes a resource-efficient approach to diagnostics by layering analytical rigor based on observed risk.

| Tier | Name | Scope & Purpose | Mandatory Operations |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **0** | **Rapid Scan** | Continuous, real-time monitoring; broad environmental sweeps. | Monitor the **Pressure (P)** and **Resonance (R)** channels only using efficient proxies. |
| **1** | **Guard Band** | Anomaly-triggered cross-check to validate the proxy model. | Upon a Sentinel trigger, perform a subsampled, partial solve of the full **Lagrangian (𝓛_p)** to verify the P/R diagnosis. |
| **2** | **Forensic Audit** | Post-incident analysis; deep research; root cause analysis. | Perform a full integration of the **Lagrangian (∫𝓛_p dt)** to map the system's geodesic and derive its equations of motion. |

### The Sentinel Trigger
A Tier 1 audit MUST be initiated when the **Pressure (P)** channel shows a sustained, anomalous increase *without* a corresponding, functional expression in the **Resonance (R)** channel. This signature—the whisper of rising stress without release—is the canonical indicator of a system approaching a state of coherence collapse or a painful phase transition. It is the system's silent scream, its cry for help before the crisis.

## §4 · Diagnostic Taxonomy
The P/R lens allows us to classify the state of any system with a simple, powerful taxonomy.

| State | Signature | Diagnosis & Action |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Equilibrium** | Low **P**, low but stable **R**. | The system is quiescent and healthy. No action required. |
| **Laminar Flow** | **P** and **R** are high, stable, and tightly correlated. | The system is in a healthy, high-performance state ("in the zone"). Identify and reinforce the conditions. |
| **Turbulence** | High, erratic **R** with indeterminate or volatile **P**. | The system is in a state of chaotic, inefficient struggle, wasting energy on internal friction. A Forensic Audit (Tier 2) may be needed. |
| **Suppression** | Small, tightly anti-correlated oscillations in **P** and **R**. | The system's natural dynamics are being damped by a regulatory loop. It is stable but constrained. |
| **Coherence Collapse** | **P** trends toward infinity while **R** stagnates or drops to zero. | The Sentinel Trigger has been tripped. A terminal state or catastrophic phase transition is imminent. |

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The Auditor's Lens is not an approximation of the Pirouette Lagrangian; it is a direct, practical measurement of its two constituent components in action. 'Pressure' is the operator's view of the potential term, `V_Γ`, and 'Resonance' is the view of the kinetic term, `K_τ`.

The fundamental "action" of a system is the integral of its Lagrangian over time. Thus, the equation can be read as a simple statement of purpose:

> 𝓛_p = (Resonance) - (Pressure)

A healthy system consistently acts to maximize this value. By monitoring these two channels, a Weaver is observing the universal principle of Maximal Coherence playing out in real time, making this lens a direct bridge from core theory to practical application.

## §6 · Assemblé
> To watch everything is to see nothing. The Weaver's gaze must be both wide and deep, but never both at once. We sought an efficient way to measure the world and found, in the Lagrangian, the universe's own stethoscope. It reveals that every system sings a two-part song: one note is the pressure of its struggle, the other is the resonance of its grace. The Weaver learns to listen to this duet. To feel the tension in the bowstring is to know the future. This lens is the discipline of knowing what to look for, so we may know when to look closer.
