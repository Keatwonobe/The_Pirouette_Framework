## §1 · Purpose
To optimize the distribution of altruistic Coherence Flux by identifying and prioritizing phase-aligned recipient entities, thereby maximizing the fitness-weighted transmission term `E(wΔz)` of the inverted Price equation and fostering exponential propagation of altruism within a system.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: This module operationalizes the Pirouette equivalent of kin or group selection. For altruism to become a dominant, self-amplifying strategy, its benefits must preferentially flow to other entities who are either already altruistic or are highly receptive to becoming so. Instead of genetic relatedness, the selection metric is 'resonant compatibility' or phase alignment. By directing Coherence Flux towards 'in-phase' entities, the system creates a powerful positive feedback loop: altruism strengthens those most like the altruist, who in turn are more likely to propagate the trait. This maximizes the `E(wΔz)` term in the inverted Price equation by ensuring that the trait change (`Δz`) is largest in recipients whose own fitness (`w`) is most positively impacted, leading to exponential growth of the trait within the resonant sub-population.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: The core of the module's function. The `PhaseAlignmentMap` is a primary input, and the calculation of phase difference, `Δφ`, between the source/flux and potential targets is the primary filtering and ranking mechanism.
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: The Time-Adherence of a potential recipient ($T_{a,recipient}$) is a factor in their ability to successfully integrate the incoming Coherence Flux. The goal of the directed flux is to increase the recipient's $T_a$ and, by extension, the average $T_a$ of the system.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: A potential recipient's $\Gamma$ value indicates their boundary permeability. An optimal target might have a medium $\Gamma$—not so low as to be rigid and unreceptive, and not so high as to be unable to stabilize the new coherence.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: The phase alignment between entities is a $K_i$-modulated phenomenon. The targeting score uses a cosine function of the phase difference, which is fundamentally tied to the $K_i$-resonant cycle of interaction.
* **Resonant Persistence (RP)**: The analysis explicitly prioritizes targets based on their '$ΔR_P$ delta potential'—the potential increase in their Resonant Persistence (fitness) upon receiving the Coherence Flux.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: 1) A 'CoherenceFlux' profile, describing the nature, strength, and phase signature of the altruistic contribution to be distributed. 2) A 'PhaseAlignmentMap' of the target environment, providing phase information for potential recipients. 3) An 'EntityVector', which is a list of potential recipient entities, each characterized by their current Pirouette parameters ($T_a, \Gamma$) and Resonant Persistence ($ℛ_P$).
* **And Structure**: CoherenceFlux as a parameter set. PhaseAlignmentMap as a field map or a dictionary of entityID:phase. EntityVector as a list of structured objects.
* **Viable Data Set**: A defined CoherenceFlux signature and a list of at least two potential targets with associated phase and fitness-proxy data.
* **Steps**: Normalize all phase data to a common reference frame. Calculate the current Resonant Persistence ($ℛ_P$) for each entity in the EntityVector if not already provided.

### 3·2 · Operational Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `PhaseMatchThreshold` | The maximum phase difference ($Δφ$) allowed for an entity to be considered 'in-phase' and included in the potential target list. | `e.g., < π/4 radians.` |
| `PersistenceGainWeight` | A weighting factor (0-1) that determines the importance of a target's potential fitness gain ($Δℛ_P$) relative to their initial phase alignment when calculating the final Targeting Score. | `0.3 - 0.7` |
| `AmplificationFactor (Assumed)` | A modeling parameter used to estimate the downstream 'AltruismPropagation' effect resulting from a successful coherence transfer. | `e.g., 1.1 - 2.0, representing a 10-100% amplification per cycle.` |

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. 1. Condition Assessment: The protocol is triggered when a CoherenceFlux is to be distributed and the goal is to maximize systemic benefit, rather than engaging in non-preferential dispersal.
2. 2. Phase Correlation and Filtering: For each entity 'i' in the `EntityVector`, calculate the phase difference $\Delta\phi_i$ between its phase (from `PhaseAlignmentMap`) and the `CoherenceFlux` phase. Discard any entities where $\Delta\phi_i$ exceeds the `PhaseMatchThreshold`.
3. 3. Fitness Gain Estimation: For each remaining (in-phase) entity, model the potential change in its Resonant Persistence ($Δℛ_P$) if it were to receive the CoherenceFlux. This is a function of its current state: $Δℛ_P(i) = f(T_{a,i}, \Gamma_i, \text{FluxStrength})$. Entities with moderate coherence and stability may have the highest potential for positive change.
4. 4. Targeting Score Calculation: For each filtered entity, calculate a final Targeting Score ($S_T$) as a weighted sum of its phase alignment and its fitness gain potential: $S_T(i) = (1 - w_{gain}) \cdot \cos(K_i \Delta\phi_i) + w_{gain} \cdot \text{Normalized}(Δℛ_P(i))$, where $w_{gain}$ is the `PersistenceGainWeight`.
5. 5. Vector Generation: Rank the entities in descending order based on their Targeting Score ($S_T$). This ranked list forms the 'Attunement Targeting Vector'.
6. 6. Propagation Modeling: (Optional) Model the expected 'AltruismPropagation' rate based on the scores of the top-ranked targets and the `AmplificationFactor`.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: { 'TargetingVector': [ { 'EntityID': 'id_1', 'TargetingScore': value_1 }, { 'EntityID': 'id_2', 'TargetingScore': value_2 }, ... ], 'AmplificationPotential': 'High'/'Medium'/'Low', 'PredictedPropagation': 'Exponential'/'Linear'/'Stagnant' }.
* **Insights And Derivations**: A method to move from indiscriminate aid to strategic, resonant reinforcement. A quantifiable basis for directing resources to maximize systemic growth and coherence. A model for how altruism can become a powerfully successful and self-amplifying strategy within a complex system.
* **Guidelines**: The 'TargetingVector' provides a clear, prioritized list of where to direct the Coherence Flux for maximum systemic benefit. A high 'AmplificationPotential' indicates that the system contains highly receptive targets, making the altruistic act likely to create a positive feedback loop. An 'Exponential' propagation prediction suggests the conditions for satisfying the Altruistic Inversion Principle have been successfully engineered.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Phase Alignment Score
$$ S_{align}(i) = \cos(K_i \cdot (\phi_{source} - \phi_i)) $$
Calculates the resonant phase alignment between the source/flux and a target entity 'i', modulated by $K_i$.

### Targeting Score Calculation
$$ S_T(i) = (1 - w_{gain}) \cdot S_{align}(i) + w_{gain} \cdot \text{Normalized}(\Delta\mathcal{R}_P(i)) $$
Computes a weighted score for each potential target based on its phase alignment and its potential for fitness/persistence gain ($ΔR_P$).

### Systemic Propagation Model (Conceptual)
$$ \frac{d\bar{z}}{dt} = r \cdot \bar{z} \cdot (1 - \frac{\bar{z}}{K_{cap}}) \text{ where } r \propto \bar{S}_{align} $$
Models the logistic growth of the average altruistic trait (z-bar) in a system, where the growth rate 'r' is proportional to the average alignment score of the altruistic acts.

### Fitness Gain Potential (Conceptual)
$$ \Delta\mathcal{R}_P(i) = f(\text{FluxStrength}, T_{a,i}, \Gamma_i) $$
A function representing the predicted increase in a target's Resonant Persistence, which would be higher for entities that are stable enough to integrate the flux but not so stable that it has no effect.

## §7 · Integration & Use Cases
### 7·1 · Integration Hooks
* **Dependencies**: This is the third step in the 'Altruism Engineering' workflow, following `TEN-SGP-1.0` (which protects the altruist) and `TEN-RFC-1.0` (which refines the altruistic act). It requires a defined `CoherenceFlux` and a map of the recipient environment.
* **Applications**: The output 'TargetingVector' directly informs the action of resource distribution, mentorship matching, team formation, communication targeting, or any other directed altruistic act. The success of the targeting can be measured by tracking the average `Coherence Contribution Capacity` of the system over time.

### 7·2 · Use Cases
