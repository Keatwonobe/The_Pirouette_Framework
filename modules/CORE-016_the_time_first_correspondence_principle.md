summary: Declares Time as substrate and standardizes a correspondence gauge that recovers the Standard Model as an effective, spatialized description without making space fundamental.

## §1 · Axiom (Substrate)
All that is, is Time. Physical “space” is a derived chart on a time-first substrate; coordinates [x,y,z] are a modeling gauge, not ontology.

## §2 · Correspondence Gauge (SM-CG)
Choose a spatialization map Σ that assigns local charts [x,y,z] to the time substrate so that, in the high-coherence, high-event-density limit, the effective action reduces to the Standard Model Lagrangian on a Lorentzian manifold.

Formally: there exists Σ such that
S_time[Ki, Γ, T_a]  →  S_SM[fields | g_{μν}]  as density → ∞ and fluctuations → small.

## §3 · Dictionary (minimal)
- EM potential: A_{μ} := ∂_{μ} arg(Ki) under Σ.
- Charge: q := orientation/asymmetry of coherence coupling in CORE-007 (crest- vs trough-leading).
- Gravitational well: gradients in Γ act as effective curvature (CORE-004/008).
- Spin-½: double-cover holonomy of the Ki motif (CORE-009).
This explains recovery of SM/QFT predictions without making spacetime fundamental.

## §4 · Normalization & Non-Circularity
- Normalization: Fix scales using external metrology (CODATA α, c, ħ) when operating in SM-CG.
- Non-circularity: Do not feed back results derived in SM-CG to calibrate CORE primitives before an independent anchor (e.g., DOMA-101 uses external α, not a value computed from CORE-009).
This preserves a clean, acyclic DAG.

## §5 · What becomes “limit theorems”
Any module that presumes fields on spacetime is canon in SM-CG, and a limit theorem of CORE-020, not ontology. (No rewrites required—tag only.)

## §6 · Immediate win
Standard Model/QFT successes in Pirouette are not coincidental: they are the Σ-shadow of a time-first substrate.

## §7 · Compliance Checklist
- [ ] Module declares whether it runs in SM-CG.
- [ ] Calibrations cite external metrology where used.
- [ ] No result is reused upstream as a premise.
- [ ] Continuum-limit assumptions are stated if invoked.
