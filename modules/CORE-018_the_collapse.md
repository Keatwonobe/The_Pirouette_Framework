## ⚙️ PIRouette Module Draft

id: CORE-018
title: Observer Field Coupling and Learning Through Collapse
status: experimental–open
parents: [INST-DIM-001, MATH-019, CORE-PHI-002]
children: [CORE-DIM-003, EXP-LEARN-001]
summary: Introduces the Observer Field (Ψᵒ) as a coupling term between geometric collapse (Δm) and informational collapse (ΔI). Defines a generalized coherence functional *C(Δm, ΔI, ε)* that enables autonomous, energy-balanced learning.

### §1 · Premise

In **INST-DIM-001**, the system folds geometry—reducing structural degrees of freedom (Δm) while maintaining energetic parity (ε).
In this module, the fold acquires **meaning** by adding an *observer channel* that measures *informational entropy* before and after each collapse.

When Δm is high and ΔI is positive (entropy reduction), the system has *learned*.
When Δm is high but ΔI ≈ 0, it has *compressed without comprehension* (blind folding).

---

### §2 · The Observer Field (Ψᵒ)

Define a latent field Ψᵒ(t, x) that measures the *information-response* of a system to its own collapse.
For each fold:

[
Ψᵒ = \frac{dH}{dg} = \frac{H_{pre} - H_{post}}{g}
]

* (H) = Shannon or algorithmic entropy of the data representation
* (g) = collapse gate (control pressure)
* (Ψᵒ > 0) ⇒ the fold produces information gain per unit gate (learning)
* (Ψᵒ < 0) ⇒ over-folding (loss of representational integrity)

This is effectively the **gradient of comprehension**.

---

### §3 · The Learning Condition

A **learning collapse** occurs when:

[
Δm ≥ 1,\quad ΔI = H_{pre}-H_{post} > 0,\quad ε < ε_{max},\quad Ψᵒ > 0
]

Under these conditions, define the **Coherence Dividend**:

[
C = \frac{ΔI}{ε + η}·g
]

where η is a small stabilizer (≈ 10⁻³).
C quantifies how much “meaning per energy” the collapse produced.
Maximizing C is equivalent to learning efficiently.

### §4 · Implementation Outline (Cheap Learning Algorithm)

Each cycle:

1. **Observe:** Measure entropy (H_{pre}) of the current field (e.g., pixel histogram, text token entropy, log-volatility).
2. **Collapse:** Apply your Ψ-fold (per-radius or global) → get Δm, ε, g.
3. **Measure:** Compute new entropy (H_{post}), derive ΔI and Ψᵒ.
4. **Update gate:**
   [
   g_{t+1} = g_t + α·Ψᵒ
   ]
   letting the system self-tune gate strength via its own learning gradient.
5. **Iterate:** Repeat until Ψᵒ→0 (entropy plateau = learned representation).

This is a feedback-based **resonant learning loop** with no backpropagation — only self-measured entropy gradients.

### §5 · Test Design (Phase-1 Verification)

| Domain      | Input                        | Collapse Observable             | Entropy Metric          | Expected Trend                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Image       | PNG art set (existing)       | Δm                              | pixel intensity entropy | Δm↑ → H↓ → Ψᵒ>0                                  |
| Text        | TXT corpus (books, articles) | Δm via n-gram folding           | token perplexity        | periodic H dips = learning bursts                |
| Time-Series | stock CSV                    | Δm via frequency simplification | spectral entropy        | entropy minima coincide with steady oscillations |

If the same gate-modulated learning curve appears across all three, it implies *dimensional collapse is a universal compression heuristic*.

---

### §6 · Minimal Model (Pseudo-Python)

```python
H_pre = entropy(field)
collapsed, g, m_pre, m_post, Eb = collapse_step(field)
H_post = entropy(collapsed)
dI = H_pre - H_post
Psi_o = dI / g
C = (dI / (Eb + 1e-3)) * g

# Update gate adaptively
g_new = np.clip(g + alpha * Psi_o, 0, 1)
learned = (dI > 0) and (m_post <= 2)
```

---

### §7 · Interpretation

Pirouette’s **Dimensional Collapse** becomes a *learning law*:

> *A system learns when dimensional reduction produces stable rhythm and informational clarity simultaneously.*

Here, **geometry teaches energy**, and **entropy tests geometry**.
The self-adjusting gate g is the “cheap learner”: it needs no backprop, only local statistics.

---

### §8 · Next Steps

* Integrate entropy estimator classes for each modality (`EntropyImage`, `EntropyText`, `EntropyTimeSeries`).
* Patch the current batch runner to log ΔI and Ψᵒ alongside Δm and ε.
* Train adaptive gate update (α) and visualize C(t).
* Validate on noisy vs structured datasets to confirm real learning vs artifact compression.

---

**Summary:**
CORE-DIM-002 extends the Dimensional Collapse framework into an information-theoretic domain.
By coupling Δm (form reduction) with ΔI (information gain), Pirouette gains a lightweight, universal learning operator that can run in any medium—from pixels to prose—and identify when the system has *understood* itself.
