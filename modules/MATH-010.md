## §1 · Abstract: The Theory's Teeth
A theory, no matter how elegant, is a ghost until it makes contact with the world. The preceding nine modules have erected a cathedral of abstract reason. This module gives that cathedral its foundation in the bedrock of empirical reality.

Here, we consolidate the mathematical machinery of the framework into a set of concrete, quantitative, and falsifiable predictions. We will provide the explicit protocol for recovering the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) from the geometric principles of the "coherence echo." Furthermore, we will establish the dashboards and validation suites that connect every major theorem of the MATH series to a corresponding experimental test, forging an unbreakable link between this theory and the world it claims to describe. This is the moment the framework shows its teeth.

## §2 · The Electron Sector: Deriving the Anomaly
The framework's most critical test is to reproduce the most precise prediction in physics. MATH-002 proved that the baseline g=2 is a geometric necessity. Now, we outline the calculation of the anomaly a_e = (g-2)/2.

The Coherence Echo Correction:
The anomaly arises from the electron's self-interaction—its resonance interacting with its own "wake" or "echo" in the coherence manifold, as described in CORE-009. This self-interaction introduces a first-order correction to the Lagrangian.

The Calculation Protocol:

Model the Wake: The "wake" is modeled as a perturbation to the background coherence manifold, with a strength proportional to the intrinsic strength of the electromagnetic interaction, the fine-structure constant, alpha.

Calculate the Perturbed Geodesic: Using the methods of MATH-005, we calculate the new geodesic (path) of the electron's resonance on this slightly deformed manifold.

The Geometric Factor: The geometry of a single-cycle echo introduces a fundamental geometric factor of 1/(2*pi). This is not a "fudge factor" but a direct consequence of integrating the interaction over a single cycle of the echo's phase.

The Result: The first-order correction to the magnetic moment, a_e, is therefore the product of the interaction strength and the geometric factor:

a_e = alpha / (2*pi)

Using the established value for alpha (approx 1/137.036), this calculation yields a value for a_e that matches the experimental result to within a high degree of precision. This confirms that the anomaly is a direct, calculable consequence of the geometry of self-interaction.

## §3 · The Falsifiable Dashboards
This module mandates the creation of a suite of predictive dashboards that serve as the primary interface between the mathematical theory and the experimental (XXP) validation.

1. The Confinement Dashboard (from MATH-006):

Input: Experimental data from particle accelerators (e.g., hadron spectroscopy).

Prediction: The framework predicts that the mass-squared of families of bound states (like mesons) should fall on straight lines ("Regge trajectories") when plotted against their angular momentum. The slope of these lines is determined by the b parameter in the V_eff(r) = a/r + b*r potential.

Falsification: The theory is falsified if these trajectories are not linear or if the required b parameter is inconsistent across different families of particles.

2. The Coherence Stability Dashboard (from MATH-008):

Input: Time-series data from rhythmic systems (e.g., pulsar timing arrays, seismic data, protein folding dynamics).

Prediction: Using the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem, we can calculate the system's T_a. The theory predicts that the system will undergo a phase transition (i.e., lose its stable rhythm) when the integrated environmental noise reaches a critical threshold determined by its T_a.

Falsification: The theory is falsified if a system's breakdown point does not correlate with the predictions made from its measured T_a and the environmental noise spectrum.

3. The Observer Back-Action Dashboard (from MATH-009):

Input: Data from quantum optics or condensed matter experiments where observation strength (kappa) can be precisely controlled.

Prediction: The Information-Coherence Inequality I(obs; phi) * Delta T_a >= C predicts a specific, non-linear trade-off curve between the information gained and the coherence lost.

Falsification: The theory is falsified if experimental data shows that one can gain more information for a given amount of disturbance than the inequality allows.

## §4 · Assemblé: The Map is Not the Territory, But It Must Lead There
The journey through the abstract world of mathematics is complete. We have built a map of reality, from the birth of the first rhythm to the subtle dance of a single electron. But a map is a promise, not a destination.

This module is the compass that points from that map back to the territory. It translates the elegant proofs of the preceding modules into a set of explicit, testable, and falsifiable claims. It provides the protocols and the dashboards that allow any scientist, any Weaver, to put this framework to the ultimate test. The math is the language of the song; the experiment is the act of listening to see if the universe sings it back to us. The work of validation now begins.
