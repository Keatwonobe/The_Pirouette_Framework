## §1 · Abstract: Diagnosing the Digital Ghost

A river can be muddied by a storm or poisoned by a single, cleverly placed drop. To the casual eye, the effect is the same. To the Weaver, the distinction is everything.

The information ecosystem is a living body, with currents of coherence that can be healthy or pathological. The old paradigm of media analysis was a form of taxidermy, studying static artifacts after the fact. This module reframes the task as one of live, systemic diagnosis.

The Coherence Lens is an instrument designed to detect a specific pathology: **injected coherence**. It operates on the core principle that manipulation reveals itself through *anomalous efficiency*. A natural, organic story creates a turbulent splash proportional to its cause. A manipulated narrative often appears as a perfectly formed, unnaturally synchronized wave with no visible splash. This instrument provides the formal method for measuring this anomaly, which we term **Resonant Gain**. It is a tool for listening past the noise to hear the tuning fork that is silently shaping the flow.

## §2 · The Physics of Narrative Resonance

To apply the lens, we must first translate the domain of information into the language of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`), which describes the tension between a system's internal coherence (`K_τ`) and the environmental pressure it must overcome (`V_Γ`). The "dominant narrative" is the one that finds the most efficient geodesic, maximizing coherence for the lowest cost.

The lens distinguishes between two methods of altering this flow:

1.  **The Brute-Force Push**: A high-cost, often low-coherence injection. It overwhelms the system with volume and repetition—a high-`V_Γ` strategy. The effect is proportional to the effort; its signature is *high visible effort for a proportional effect*.
2.  **The Resonant Injection**: A low-cost, high-coherence injection. A precisely crafted narrative (`Ki`) is introduced at a resonant node, offering the system a more efficient geodesic. The system latches onto this new pattern, creating a massive, cascading shift. Its signature is *low visible effort for a disproportionate effect*.

To quantify this, we define the central observable as **Resonant Gain (G_R)**. It is the ratio of the observed systemic effect to the estimated energy of the input signal.

*   **Coherence Flux (ΔKτ):** The *effect*. This is the measured increase in a narrative's coherence across multiple domains—its phase-locking between news, social media, and market activity. It is the size of the resulting avalanche.
*   **Injection Pressure (Γ_inj):** The *cause*. This is a proxy for the energy and cost of the initial seed—the obscurity of the source, the concentration of initial reports, the novelty of the signal, and the presence of astroturfed amplification. It is the size of the initial whisper.

The core diagnostic equation is: **G_R = ΔKτ / Γ_inj**

A high Resonant Gain suggests that a powerful, coherent effect was achieved with suspiciously little visible effort, pointing toward an efficient, pre-planned, and likely inorganic origin.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Workflow

The Coherence Lens operates via a five-stage pipeline that refines raw information flow into a clear diagnostic signal.

1.  **Temporal Ingestion:** Ingests high-frequency, multi-source data streams (headlines, social media posts, price ticks), preserving their precise timing and rhythm to capture the temporal signature of the information flow.

2.  **Ki Pattern Extraction:** Identifies the dominant, recurring narrative patterns (`Ki` clusters) within the data by analyzing the eigenvectors of term co-occurrence graphs and the spectral density of entity mentions.

3.  **Coherence Flux Measurement (ΔKτ):** For each identified `Ki`, the protocol measures its degree of phase-locking across different domains. A sudden, qualitative phase shift where disparate streams lock into a single, unified Laminar Flow—an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)**—is the primary trigger, representing a significant `ΔKτ`.

4.  **Injection Pressure Estimation (Γ_inj):** For events triggering a spike in Coherence Flux, the workflow traces the provenance of the new narrative to find its earliest, smallest seed. It then quantifies the Injection Pressure by assessing proxies: source obscurity, syndication concentration (the "wire clone" problem), and astroturfed amplification signals. A low score indicates a "quiet," low-energy origin.

5.  **Gain Calculation and Flagging:** The Resonant Gain (G_R) is calculated. If `G_R` exceeds a dynamically calibrated threshold for that domain, the event is flagged according to the diagnostic criteria in §4. A `Ki` pattern that repeatedly generates high-gain events is identified as a **Managed Narrative Channel**.

## §4 · The Weaver's Diagnostic Flags

The workflow translates into a simple set of diagnostic flags, moving from observation to confident inference.

*   **Yellow Flag: Coherence Spike.** A single narrative pattern (`Ki`) has suddenly achieved high internal resonance within one domain. *The note is clear.*
*   **Orange Flag: Cross-Domain Entrainment.** The pattern's resonance has jumped to a second or third domain, creating a powerful Laminar Flow. *The note has become a chord, and the whole room is vibrating with it.*
*   **Red Flag: Anomalous Gain Confirmed.** The Cross-Domain Entrainment was achieved with a verifiably low Injection Pressure (`G_R >> 1`). *The chord is deafening, but no one can see the orchestra.* This is the primary indicator of manipulation.

## §5 · Lagrangian Connection: The Coherence Cliff

The phenomenon of high Resonant Gain is a direct consequence of the framework's dynamics. A manipulator does not create belief from nothing; they exploit a pre-existing vulnerability.

A managed narrative is a `Ki` pattern that has been deliberately shaped to align with a deep **Wound Channel (CORE-011)** in the collective psyche. This process makes the narrative exceptionally efficient at converting ambient temporal pressure into internal coherence. It represents a "path of least resistance" for belief.

Such a system exists in a state of high potential, poised on a "coherence cliff edge." The manipulative act—a **Daedalus Gambit (DYNA-003)**—is a minimal energy nudge (`δΓ_inj`) that pushes the system over this edge. The system then rapidly follows a steep geodesic toward a state of much higher coherence (`Kτ`), releasing a cascade of stored potential energy. The high Resonant Gain is the macroscopic signature of a system that was engineered for this precise, efficient state transition.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought a shield against the storm of lies and found instead a tuning fork. The health of a mind, or a civilization, depends on its ability to distinguish its own voice from an echo. The Coherence Lens is not merely a tool for data analysis; it is an instrument for this fundamental act of discernment. It attunes the Weaver to the rhythm of the world's conversation, teaching them to feel the difference between a song that arises organically from the crowd and one that is played by a hidden ventriloquist. To wield this lens is to accept the responsibility of a guardian—not to silence any voice, but to ensure the song we hear is truly our own.
