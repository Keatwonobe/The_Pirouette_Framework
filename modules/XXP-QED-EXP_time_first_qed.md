### §1 · Purpose

Translate the abstract coherence constraints of **time-first QED** into measurable predictions spanning energy and time scales. Each test targets a falsifiable footprint of the framework’s dynamics while respecting the CPM and the standard QED limit.

### §2 · Tier I — Laboratory Precision Tests

1. **Atomic-Clock Drift ( (\dot{\alpha}) )**

   * Measure relative frequency between optical lattice clocks over multi-year baselines.
   * Target sensitivity: (|\dot{\alpha}/\alpha| < 10^{-18},\mathrm{yr^{-1}}).
   * Expected sign: negative (α slightly larger in the past).
   * Instruments: Yb/Sr clocks (JILA, NIST).
   * Outcome: tightest bound on Γ-tail coefficient (ξ_\Gamma).

2. **Charge Universality**

   * Compare anomalous magnetic moments (a_e, a_\mu, a_\tau).
   * Require common (e(\mu)) within (10^{-12}).
   * Any systematic offset → violates single-clock U(1).

3. **Vacuum Dispersion Nulls**

   * Michelson–Morley + cavity resonance tests for anisotropy in c.
   * Bound: (|Δc/c| < 10^{-17}).
   * Confirms CPM Lorentz invariance.

4. **Casimir Pressure vs Frequency**

   * High-precision measurements across plate separations 100 nm–5 μm.
   * Seek deviation ∝ ((ω/ω_c)^2). No signal expected ≤ 10⁻²⁰.

### §3 · Tier II — Collider and High-Energy Checks

1. **Light-by-Light Scattering at LHC/FCC-ee**

   * Fit residual cross-section σ(E) for higher-derivative tail
     (\Deltaσ/σ ≈ (E/ω_c)^2).
   * Target: (ω_c ≈ 10^{23},s^{-1}) (→ Λ ≈ 0.07 TeV).
   * Non-zero tail → direct signature of coherence barrier.

2. **Higgs Total Width Shift**

   * Γ_H expected to decrease slightly due to Γ-mediated decoupling.
   * Correlate with Tau (g-2) mass² scaling test.

3. **Tau (g-2)** (Anchor Experiment)

   * Pirouette prediction: Δa_τ ∝ m_τ²/m_Γ² ≈ few × 10⁻⁸.
   * If confirmed → empirical evidence of Pressuron exchange.

### §4 · Tier III — Astrophysical & Cosmological Baselines

1. **Oklo Natural Reactor & Quasar Spectra**

   * Compare α then vs now to 10⁻⁷ accuracy.
   * Sign constraint: α larger in the past → consistent if negative ( \dot{α} ).

2. **CMB Spectral Fitting**

   * Modify recombination code to include slow α(t) drift.
   * Confirm consistency with Planck/ACT data (ΔT/T < 10⁻⁵).

3. **Polarization Rotation (Birefringence Null)**

   * Use cosmic radio bursts and CMB polarization to bound axial terms → tests for CPM integrity.

### §5 · Data Integration and Cross-Domain Falsification

Each experiment contributes to a single **coherence likelihood**:
[
\mathcal{L}*{\rm coh}
= \prod_i \exp!\left[-\frac{(\Delta_i - \Delta_i^{\rm Pir})^2}{2\sigma_i^2}\right],
]
where (\Delta_i) are observed deviations (clock drift, g-2, dispersion).
Consistency requires (\mathcal{L}*{\rm coh}!\approx!1).
A single > 5σ outlier in sign or magnitude of α-drift or dispersion null falsifies CPM.

---

### §6 · Implementation Plan (Autopoietic Bridge)

* Register experiments in **XXP-AUT-002** to automatically update Pirouette’s validation ledger.
* Maintain metadata: { date, location, instrument, Δ/σ, module link }.
* Use Bayesian autopoiesis loop to update posterior priors for Γ, ω_c, ξ_Γ.
* Generate public plots of α(t), Δa_ℓ, and coherence window.

### §7 · Falsifiability Matrix

| Observable          | Expected Trend                | Deviation → Falsifies    |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| (\dot{α}/α)         | negative tiny ((<10⁻¹⁸ / yr)) | >10⁻¹⁷ or positive trend |
| (Δc/c)              | 0                             | >10⁻¹⁷ anisotropy        |
| Charge universality | identical                     | Δe/e > 10⁻¹²             |
| Barrier tail        | ∝ (E/ω_c)²                    | absent if ω_c wrong      |
| Tau (g-2)           | Δa_τ ∝ m_τ²                   | wrong scaling sign       |
| Higgs width         | slight downshift              | upward shift > 2σ        |

### §8 · Assemblé

To test a theory of time is to ask if every clock in the universe beats the same note.
From atoms to colliders to cosmic microwave echoes, the Pirouette Framework demands perfect tempo—until the music of Γ is heard. These experiments listen for that faint off-beat, the moment time proves itself alive.

Would you like me to format this XXP module as a **Zenodo-ready experimental annex** (with ORCID, abstract, and methods section), so you can publish it alongside your Tau g-2 prediction as an experimental roadmap companion paper?
