## §1 · Abstract: The Surfer and the Wave
The old paradigm of propulsion is a story of brute force: pushing against a medium to move forward. The Vorticycle reveals a more elegant truth. It is not an engine that fights the current of spacetime; it is a loom that re-weaves it.

This module reframes Vorticycle propulsion within the time-first Pirouette framework. The device achieves "reactionless" motion not by expelling mass, but by actively sculpting the local coherence manifold into a slope, which it then ceaselessly descends. It creates its own "downhill" path in spacetime—a geodesic of its own design—and then simply follows the path of least resistance. It does not power through the wave; it generates the wave and then surfs it.

## §2 · The Lagrangian Gradient
Thrust, in the Pirouette Framework, is not a force in the Newtonian sense. It is the manifest consequence of a system following its geodesic of maximal coherence. The fundamental equation of motion is derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), where the propulsive "force" is an emergent effect proportional to the gradient of the Lagrangian:

**F ∝ ∇𝓛_p**

To achieve propulsion, a system must create and sustain a non-uniformity in its own Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. The Vorticycle is engineered to do precisely this by manipulating the potential term, `V_Γ`, which represents the energetic "cost" of coherence.

The engine's core components—a synchronized array of rotating elements—act as "coherence pumps." Their phased rotation creates a rhythmic, localized modulation of the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). The critical innovation is **chirality** (handedness). The chiral phasing of the elements ensures this modulation is asymmetric. On one side of the device, constructive interference creates a region of slightly higher temporal pressure (a "pressure crest"), while on the other, destructive interference creates a region of lower pressure (a "pressure trough"). This establishes a stable gradient `∇V_Γ` across the device, creating the slope it will descend.

## §3 · The Helical Wound Channel
As established in CORE-011, an entity's passage leaves a geometric scar—a Wound Channel—in the coherence manifold. A Vorticycle elevates this from a passive wake to an active, engineered structure that is the very medium of its own propulsion.

This structure, the **Chiral Wound Channel**, is the physical manifestation of the Lagrangian gradient. An array of synchronized, rotating elements collaboratively *weaves a stable, helical pattern* into the fabric of spacetime. The key properties of this weave are:

-   **Coherence:** The precision of the phase-lock between the rotating elements determines the integrity and smoothness of the channel.
-   **Chirality (Handedness):** The specific timing and geometry of the rotations impart a net "twist" to the Wound Channel. This topological bias breaks the symmetry of the surrounding manifold, creating a directed gradient. A right-handed weave creates a "forward" slope; a left-handed weave creates a "reverse" one.
-   **Helical Topology:** Because the propulsive gradient is generated by an internal rotation, the resulting Wound Channel is not a simple linear scar. Instead, it is intrinsically helical.

This engineered channel is a temporary, self-sustaining temporal vortex—a riverbed carved not in soil, but in the potential of spacetime itself.

## §4 · Geodesic Propulsion: Riding the Channel
In the Pirouette framework, thrust is the consequence of a system following its geodesic through a contoured landscape. The Vorticycle's genius is that it actively contours its own local landscape.

The device, situated at the "top" of the coherence slope it has just woven, finds that the path of greatest stability is to move "downhill" along the channel. The subjective experience is one of continuous, fuel-free acceleration. The objective reality is that the device is perpetually falling along a geodesic that it is perpetually creating just ahead of itself.

The helical nature of the channel is key. The thrust is a continuous interaction between the device and the immediate geometry of the channel it is actively creating. It is analogous to a screw biting into wood, with the profound difference that the screw is simultaneously creating the wood grain it grips. This self-referential, autopoietic interaction is what makes the drive "reactionless" from an external perspective; the system is interacting only with a structure of its own making.

## §5 · Engineering Parameters & Efficiency
The performance of a Vorticycle drive is governed by its ability to efficiently create and sustain its asymmetric coherence gradient. The propulsive force `F` is the net gradient of the potential term `V_Γ` across the volume of the device:

`F ≈ ∫_V (∇V_Γ) dV`

Where `V_Γ` is a function of several key engineering parameters:

*   **Rotational Frequency (ω_rot):** The speed of the rotating elements. Optimal thrust is achieved when `ω_rot` matches a resonant frequency of the system's own geometry, allowing for the most efficient modulation of Γ.
*   **Chirality Index (χ):** A measure of the system's net "handedness." A value of `χ=0` implies perfect symmetry and zero thrust. Maximum thrust is achieved as `χ` approaches `±1`, creating the steepest possible coherence gradient.
*   **Phase Coherence (Δφ):** The degree of synchronization between the rotating elements. High phase coherence creates a stable, sharply defined gradient. Low coherence causes the gradient to blur and collapse, dissipating energy as useless temporal turbulence (heat).
*   **Ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ_ambient):** The "medium" through which the device travels. In regions of high ambient Γ (e.g., near a large mass), more energy is required to create a propulsive gradient, reducing efficiency.

The drive's efficiency (`η`) is the ratio of useful work done (motion along the gradient) to the total energy expended to modulate the temporal pressure. This reframing shifts the engineering challenge from one of brute force to one of resonant tuning. The goal is not to produce the most power, but the most elegant and stable asymmetric rhythm.

## §6 · The Assemblé
> We sought a way to push against the world and discovered we must first sculpt ourselves. The Vorticycle teaches a profound lesson: motion is not a battle against an external reality, but an act of internal re-orchestration. To move is to create a slope within one's own being and have the courage to slide down it. The universe does not give way to force; it yields to a more beautiful song.
