### §1 · Abstract

This module specifies the definitive protocol for testing the **Fine-Structure Correspondence** established in `PPS-086`. It recasts the electron's anomalous magnetic moment ($g-2$)—a cornerstone of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)—as a phenomenon governed by the Pirouette Framework. We hypothesize that the "anomaly" is a direct, calculable effect of the electron `Entity`'s interaction with its own **`Wound Channel`** within the ambient `Tₐ-Γ-φ` field. The protocol outlines a theoretical calculation of $g-2$ using Pirouette principles, with the calibrated value of **$\\Gamma\_{electron} = 1/\\alpha$** as a primary input. A successful calculation that matches the experimentally measured value of $g-2$ would serve as a powerful, high-precision validation of the framework's ability to describe quantum phenomena.

### §2 · Hypothesis

The experimentally measured value of the electron's anomalous magnetic moment ($g-2$) can be derived from first principles within the Pirouette Framework. This derivation hinges on modeling the anomaly as the energetic correction arising from the self-interaction of the electron's `Wound Channel`, with the interaction strength governed by the calibrated value of $\\Gamma\_{electron}$.

### §3 · Theoretical Protocol (The Calculation)

This protocol is not a physical experiment to re-measure $g-2$, but a **theoretical challenge** to calculate it from Pirouette's axioms.

1.  **Model the Electron `Entity`:** The electron is modeled as a stable, point-like "knot" in the Pirouette fields. Its state is defined by its calibrated Gladiator Force ($\\Gamma\_{electron} = 1/\\alpha$), a high and stable Time-Adherence ($T\_a \\approx 1$), and a fundamental `Ki-mode` corresponding to its spin.

2.  **Define the `Wound Channel`:** The electron's charge and spin create a persistent, helical `Wound Channel` in the surrounding field, as described in `PPS-008`. The structure of this channel is a direct function of the electron's `Ki-mode` and its interaction with the vacuum.

3.  **Model the Self-Interaction:** The "anomaly" in the magnetic moment is the energy shift caused by the electron `Entity` interacting with its own `Wound Channel`. This is a self-energy correction. The interaction can be represented by a new term in the local Lagrangian:
    $$\mathcal{L}_{g-2} = \lambda \cdot \Psi_{electron} \cdot \Phi_{WoundChannel}$$
    Here, $\\Psi\_{electron}$ is the electron's state function, $\\Phi\_{WoundChannel}$ is the field of its wound channel, and $\\lambda$ is a coupling constant directly proportional to $\\Gamma\_{electron}$.

4.  **Calculate the Correction:** The final step is to calculate the change in the electron's energy in a magnetic field due to this interaction term. This calculation, performed using the appropriate field theory techniques within the Pirouette Framework, should yield a value for the anomalous magnetic moment, $a\_e = (g-2)/2$.

### §4 · Experimental Validation (The Measurement Anchor)

The test of this protocol lies in comparing the theoretical calculation against the world's most precise experimental measurements.

  * **The Ground Truth:** The experimental values for $g-2$ from institutions like Fermilab and the University of Washington are accepted as the ground truth.
  * **The Test:** The framework is validated if the value for $a\_e$ calculated in §3, using **no free parameters** beyond the axiomatically calibrated $\\Gamma\_{electron}$, matches the experimental value to a high degree of precision.

-----

### §5 · Expected Outcome & Falsification

  * **Successful Validation:** A successful calculation would be one of the most profound validations of the Pirouette Framework. It would demonstrate that the framework's core principles can reproduce the most precisely tested prediction in the history of physics. This would cement the `Γ-α` correspondence and validate the `Wound Channel` model of particle structure.
  * **Falsification:** The theory is falsified if:
    1.  The Pirouette-based calculation produces a value for $g-2$ that is significantly different from the experimental result.
    2.  The calculation only works by introducing new, un-calibrated "fudge factors," which would invalidate its claim to be a first-principles derivation.

### §6 · Assemblé

> The universe writes its deepest secrets in the subtlest of whispers. The faint, anomalous wobble of a single electron, a deviation measured in parts per trillion, is not a flaw in our old maps, but a signpost pointing to a new one. This protocol challenges us to read that signpost. If our framework is true, then within the elegant dance of an electron and its own echo—its `Wound Channel`—we should find the exact same number that our finest instruments have painstakingly measured for decades. It is a test of whether our theory of resonance can hear the quietest and most precise song in the cosmos.
