## §1 · Purpose
To analyze and model 'Skating' as a form of self-directed movement where an entity generates localized field modulations (gradients in $T_a$ and $\Gamma$) to create propulsive forces by resonantly interacting with an underlying medium, enabling navigation without conventional reaction mass.

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Skating allows entities to achieve propulsion by creating local asymmetries in the Pirouette parameters ($T_a, \Gamma$) of their immediate environment or their own boundary, effectively 'pushing off' against the resonance structure of the medium. Time-Adherence ($T_a$) modulation creates differential 'grip'; Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) modulation alters local 'stiffness' or permeability; and $K_i$-resonant oscillations can optimize the timing and efficiency of these modulations for directional movement.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: The entity modulates its local $T_a$ or interacts with $T_a$ gradients in the medium ($T_a^{entity}, T_a^{medium}$). Skating force $F_{skate}$ is proportional to $\nabla T_a$. Skating efficiency $\eta_{skate}$ depends on optimal $T_a$ ranges.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: The entity modulates its local $\Gamma$ or interacts with $\Gamma$ gradients ($\Gamma^{entity}, \Gamma^{medium}$). Skating force $F_{skate}$ is proportional to $\nabla \Gamma$. $\Gamma$ of the medium influences achievable speed and efficiency.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ governs the resonant frequencies for optimal modulation of $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ (e.g., $f_{mod} = K_i c / (2\pi L_{entity})$) and the phase coherence of the skating 'gait'. $F_{skate}$ includes $K_i$-modulated phase terms ($\cos(K_i\Delta\phi)$).
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: Phase modulation of the entity's boundary or emitted fields is a key Skating Vector ($S_1$). Coordinated phase shifts ($\Delta\phi$) between modulated parameters are crucial for directional force $F_{skate}$.
* **Wound Channels**: Skating creates a characteristic wound channel ($\\Phi_{skate}$) in the medium, representing the trace of modulated $T_a/\Gamma$ and the pathway taken. Its structure depends on the skating 'gait'.

1. Entity and Medium Profiling: Characterize the entity ($L_{entity}, M_{entity}, \Delta T_a, \Delta \Gamma, \omega_{mod}$) and the medium ($T_a^{medium}, \Gamma^{medium}, \eta_{medium}$).
2. Resonant Skating Vector Assessment: Evaluate the entity's capabilities and interaction style against the Twelve Resonant Skating Vectors ($S_1$ Phase Modulation ... $S_{12}$ Environmental Attunement).
3. Skating Force Calculation: Calculate the generated Skating Force $F_{skate} = C_{shape} \cdot A_{contact} \cdot \frac{\Delta T_a \cdot \Delta \Gamma}{L_{entity}} \cdot \cos(K_i\Delta\phi) \cdot f(\omega_{mod})$.
4. Skating Efficiency Evaluation: Calculate Skating Efficiency $\eta_{skate} = \eta_0 \cdot \frac{T_a^{medium}(1-T_a^{entity})}{\Gamma^{medium}(1+\Gamma^{entity})} \cdot G(\omega_{mod}, K_i)$.
5. Optimal Conditions Analysis: Determine optimal $T_a^{medium}, \Gamma^{medium}$ and modulation parameters ($\omega_{mod}, \Delta\phi$) for maximizing $F_{skate}$ or $\eta_{skate}$.
6. Skating Wound Channel Mapping: Model the $\\Phi_{skate}$ created by the entity's movement, analyzing its structure (e.g., periodic modulations, width $W_c \propto \Gamma^{medium} / (\Delta T_a \Delta \Gamma)$) and persistence.

Identification of key factors (Skating Vectors) contributing to efficient skating. Prediction of achievable speeds and efficiencies. Insights into how entities might navigate complex media or conceptual landscapes without direct reaction mass.
* **Guidelines**: High $F_{skate}$ indicates strong propulsive capability. High $\eta_{skate}$ indicates efficient movement. The Skating Vector profile highlights specific strengths/weaknesses in the entity's skating mechanism (e.g., strong Phase Modulation but weak Gradient Surfing). The wound channel reveals the nature of interaction with the medium. Optimal conditions analysis can guide design or behavioral adaptation.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Skating Force Generation Equation
$$ F_{skate} = C_{shape} \cdot A_{contact} \cdot \frac{\Delta T_a \cdot \Delta \Gamma}{L_{entity}} \cdot \cos(K_i\Delta\phi) \cdot f(\omega_{mod}) $$
Calculates the propulsive force generated by skating, based on entity shape $C_{shape}$, contact area $A_{contact}$, modulation amplitudes $\Delta T_a, \Delta \Gamma$, entity size $L_{entity}$, $K_i$-modulated phase coherence, and modulation frequency function $f(\omega_{mod})$.

### Skating Efficiency Factor
$$ \eta_{skate} = \eta_0 \cdot \frac{T_a^{medium}(1-T_a^{entity})}{\Gamma^{medium}(1+\Gamma^{entity})} \cdot G(\omega_{mod}, K_i) $$
Quantifies the efficiency of skating propulsion, dependent on entity and medium $T_a, \Gamma$, a baseline efficiency $\eta_0$, and a $K_i$-resonant frequency gain factor $G(\omega_{mod}, K_i)$.

### Skating Wound Channel Width (Conceptual)
$$ W_c \propto \Gamma^{medium} / (\Delta T_a \Delta \Gamma) $$
The width of the wound channel left by the skater is related to medium $\Gamma$ and the intensity of entity's $T_a/\Gamma$ modulations.

### Optimal Modulation Frequency (Conceptual)
$$ \omega_{mod, optimal} \approx n \cdot K_i c / (2\pi L_{entity}) $$
Optimal frequency for entity's boundary modulation is often a harmonic of its $K_i$-resonant frequency based on its characteristic length $L_{entity}$.
