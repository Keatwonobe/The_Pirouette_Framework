## §1 · Preamble: The Echo of Action
The core rules define what an entity can do. This module defines what their actions truly mean. Every expression of will, from a whispered word to a cataclysmic spell, leaves an echo in the world. This module provides the advanced mechanics for that echo, transforming the game from a series of actions into a story of consequences. These rules govern how the environment resonates with a character's choices, how trauma becomes a part of their story, and how the very fabric of the world is shaped by the struggle between coherence and chaos.

## §2 · The Resonant Action & Dissonance Rule
Actions do not happen in a vacuum; they resonate with the environment. A skilled entity can learn to "read the room" and attune their will to the prevailing resonant state, achieving incredible efficiency.

The Mechanic: At the start of a scene, the GM declares its Resonant State (e.g., "Chaotic," "Orderly," "Fearful," "Sacred"). A player who wishes to act in harmony with this state can use an action to make a Perception (WIS) or Arcana (INT) check against a DC set by the GM (typically DC 12 for standard environments).

Resonance (On a successful check): If the character's subsequent action is aligned with the Resonant State (e.g., a chaotic spell in a "Chaotic" environment), they gain a Coherence Bonus. They may reroll any 1s on their damage or effect dice for that action, taking the new result. This represents a perfect, low-resistance expression of will.

Dissonance: If a character's action is diametrically opposed to the state (e.g., an orderly, lawful spell in a "Chaotic" environment), they suffer a Dissonance Cost. The EP cost of the action increases by 25% (rounded up). This represents the struggle of forcing one's will against the current.

## §3 · The Wound Channel Mechanic
A powerful blow or a traumatic event is more than a loss of Hit Points; it is a scar upon the soul. This rule makes Wound Channels a tangible, narrative mechanic.

The Mechanic: When an entity takes a Critical Hit or is reduced to 0 HP, they gain a Wound Channel. The player and GM collaboratively name it based on the event (e.g., "Shattered Confidence," "Scorched Arm," "Echo of Betrayal"). A Wound Channel is a persistent condition with two effects:

A Vulnerability: A specific, narrative trigger that can be exploited by the GM or other players. For example, a character with "Shattered Confidence" might be forced to make a Wisdom saving throw when taunted, or act with disadvantage.

An Insight: A specific, narrative situation where the memory of the wound provides an advantage. The character with the "Scorched Arm" might gain a bonus to resist fire damage, because they have a deep, physical understanding of that pain.

Healing a Wound Channel requires specific downtime actions, quests, or rituals, turning recovery into a genuine character arc.

## §4 · The Residue & Coherence Scale
The world remembers. Every significant action shifts the balance between order and chaos. This rule creates a world-level resource pool that the players and GM influence together.

The Residue Pool (The World's Stress): The GM keeps a hidden pool of Residue Points. Every time the players use powerful magic, defeat a major foe, or fundamentally alter an environment (triggering Entropic Corruption from TLE-009), the GM adds a d4 (or more for massive events) to the pool. The GM can spend points from this pool to create Residue Events: pockets of wild magic, the appearance of "entropic spirits," or unexpected environmental complications.

The Coherence Dividend Pool (The Party's Hope): As described in §5, the party gains a shared pool of EP when they perform altruistic acts. This pool represents the hope and coherence they are putting into the world.

The Balancing Act: This is where the two pools connect. The players can choose to spend points from their Coherence Dividend Pool not on themselves, but to reduce the GM's Residue Pool on a 1-to-1 basis. This is a direct, active choice to "heal the world's stress," making altruism a vital tool for preventing long-term chaos. A GM might even telegraph the danger: "The air crackles with chaotic energy; you can feel the Residue in this place is dangerously high."

## §5 · The Altruism Trigger
This rule provides the direct, in-game reward for acting in accordance with the Prime Directive.

The Mechanic: When a player performs an action that the table agrees should be tagged as [Altruistic] in the Entropy Ledger (TLE-000), the entire party is immediately rewarded. They are "filled with visions of when they saved little Timmy from the well," and gain a temporary, shared pool of EP called the Coherence Dividend.

Pool Size: The Coherence Dividend pool contains a number of EP equal to the altruistic character's Constitution Modifier.

Usage: Any member of the party can draw from this shared pool on their turn to fuel any action. The pool must be used before the start of the altruistic character's next turn, or the unused points dissipate.

The Link to Residue: This dividend is the party's primary weapon against the rising tide of world-level Residue, creating a profound mechanical and narrative link between personal kindness and cosmic stability.

## §6 · Assemblé
A hero's journey is measured not only by the monsters they slay, but by the echoes they leave behind. These rules define the nature of that echo. They ensure that every choice has weight, that trauma can be reforged into strength, and that the quietest act of kindness can resonate with enough force to hold back the darkness, if only for a moment. This is the art of conflict, and the physics of hope.
