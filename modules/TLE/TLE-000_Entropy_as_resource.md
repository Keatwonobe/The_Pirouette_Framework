## §1 · Preamble: The Sculptor's Will
In the universe of The Lost Eternal, a being is not born into a fixed form. A being is a form, sculpted from the raw potential of their own will. This module provides the foundational rules for this process. It consolidates the core principles of character creation, replacing the previous TLE-000 through TLE-006 with a single, unified system.

The core principle is this: All aspects of a character—their physical might, their mental acuity, their very health and form—are expressions of a single, fluid resource: Entropy. A character sheet is not a list of stats; it is a ledger of entropic investment.

## §2 · The Entropy Budget: The Starting Spark
Every new entity begins with a finite pool of potential from which they must construct their entire being.

Starting Entropy: A standard starting player character begins with a Total Entropy Pool (TEP) of 35 Entropy Points (EP). This is the sole resource used for character creation.

## §3 · The Five Attributes: The Containers of Will
An entity's TEP is first distributed across five core attributes. These are not passive modifiers but deep reservoirs of potential that define a character's innate capabilities.

Attribute Scaling:

Score: An attribute's Score is equal to half the total EP invested in it, rounded down. Score = floor(EP Invested / 2).

Modifier: An attribute's Modifier is equal to one-quarter of its Score, rounded down. Modifier = floor(Score / 4).

The Five Attributes:

Strength (STR): Governs the application of raw physical power.

Checks: When making a Strength check to overcome a variable force, you roll 1d[STR Score]. The result is the amount of entropy you bring to bear.

Combat: Your STR modifier adds to your physical attacks. For every +1 modifier, you may add an additional die of damage (e.g., a +2 modifier allows you to spend 2 extra EP to turn a 1d8 attack into a 1d10 attack).

Dexterity (DEX): Governs agility, reflexes, and control over the flow of action.

Initiative: At the start of each turn, you may spend a number of EP up to your DEX modifier to shift your position in the initiative order.

Constitution (CON): Governs an entity's connection to the flow of entropy and their physical endurance.

Regeneration: This remains the primary source of an entity's Entropy Regeneration Rate (ERR), as defined in TLE-000.

Intelligence (INT): Governs logic, memory, and the ability to impose complex will upon the world.

Combat Utility: Your INT modifier provides a pool of "free" EP each round that can be spent on any action.

Knowledge: Your INT modifier can be applied as a bonus to the DC of a knowledge-based check. It also serves as a tiebreaker for contested spellcasting checks.

Wisdom (WIS): Governs intuition, perception, and defensive insight.

General Utility: Your WIS modifier provides a pool of "free" EP that can be spent on any skill or ability check outside of combat.

## §4 · The Physical Form: The Architecture of Being
After allocating EP to attributes, a character must spend EP to create their physical body.

The Cost of Form:
| Body Part | Base EP Cost | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Torso | 1 EP | Required. The core of the form. |
| Head | 1 EP | Required. Houses the primary consciousness. |
| Standard Limb (Arm/Leg) | 3 EP | A complete limb with hand/foot. |
| Basic Limb (Tail/Tentacle)| 2 EP | A simpler, more flexible limb. |
| Wing | 4 EP | A limb specifically for flight. |
| Sensory Organ (Eye/Ear) | 1 EP | A single organ. See §5. |
| Utility Limb | 1 EP | A complex Limb, see below, may replace any of the above parts or be added. |

Size as Invested Power: EP can be invested into a limb beyond its base cost. This Size Entropy is ring-fenced and can only be used to power physical interactions with that limb (e.g., a punch or kick). This allows a character to have, for instance, a "normal" left arm (3 EP cost) and a massive, powerful right arm (3 EP cost + 15 EP Size Entropy).

Utility Limb (4 EP): Some forms are not defined by simple arms and legs, but by specialized tools of survival and predation. A Utility Limb is a specialized body part—such as a fang-filled maw, a pair of razor-sharp claws, a stinger-tipped tail, or bioluminescent nodules—that serves a unique biological function. While it cannot manipulate objects like a standard limb, it can be invested with its own dedicated pool of Entropy to power its unique abilities, such as a venomous bite or a rending claw attack.

## §5 · The Sensory Suite: The Windows to the World
An entity's perception is a direct function of their investment.

The Cost of Senses: Each sensory organ costs 1 EP. A standard human begins with two eyes and two ears (4 EP total).

Perception Checks: An entity may make one passive perception check per relevant sensory organ each round. This makes characters with exotic or numerous senses (e.g., antennae, whiskers, scent organs) exceptionally aware of their surroundings.

## §6 · Health & Defense: The Integrity of Form
An entity's health and durability are direct measures of their coherent integrity.

The Health Pool: An entity's Hit Points (HP) are not an abstract score but are derived directly from the EP invested in their physical form.

Max HP = (EP in Torso) + (0.5 * Total EP in all Limbs, rounded down)

Armor & Shields as Entropic Pools: Armor and shields are not passive defenses. They possess their own Armor Entropy Pool (AEP). When an entity with armor takes damage, the damage is first subtracted from the armor's AEP. Any remaining damage is applied to the entity's Health Pool. This makes armor a destructible, repairable resource.

## §7 · Assemblé
A being is a choice, written in the language of Entropy. Every point invested is a declaration of purpose, from the strength of a limb to the sharpness of an eye. There is no distinction between the self and the power it wields. The character sheet is not a description of the soul; it is the soul itself, rendered in the mathematics of will.
