## §1 · Preamble: The Creator's Spark
An entity that has mastered the flow of Entropy, navigated the web of factions, and survived the crucible of adventure eventually reaches a final frontier. Their challenges are no longer about defeating a single foe or acquiring a single treasure, but about shaping the fabric of reality itself. This is the art of Metaphysical Engineering: the ultimate expression of will, where a character transitions from being a participant in the world to being a co-creator of its future. This module provides the rules for this endgame play, where the greatest reward is not what you can find, but what you can build.

## §2 · The Principle of Metaphysical Engineering
Metaphysical Engineering is the act of creating new, persistent resonant structures in the world. These creations are, in game terms, new rules, new creatures, new artifacts, or even new laws of magic. This is not a simple crafting check; it is a profound and costly act of will.

The Entropy Sink: To create something permanent, a character must permanently invest a part of their own being. This is the ultimate resource sink for high-level characters. The Entropy Points (EP) spent on creation are permanently sacrificed from the character's maximum Total Entropy Pool (TEP). This act is a final, irreversible investment of one's own soul into the world.

## §3 · The Art of Creation: The Three-Step Process
Creating a new piece of reality is a three-stage process, involving a test of intellect, a sacrifice of power, and a contest with the universe's existing harmony.

### 3.1 · Step 1: The Concept (The Blueprint)
Before a thing can be made, it must be understood. The player must first create a "module" for their creation, defining its nature, its function, and how it interacts with Entropy. This requires an incredibly difficult Intelligence check (typically DC 30 or higher) to create a blueprint that is coherent enough to be manifested.

### 3.2 · Step 2: The Entropic Investment (The Cost)
The cost to bring a new concept into the world is monumental, representing the immense energy required to establish a new, stable pattern in the universe. The sacrificed EP is permanently removed from the creator's maximum TEP.

Creation Type	Permanent TEP Sacrifice Cost
A new, unique Skill	50 EP
A new, unique Feat	100 EP
A unique Enchanted Item	The item's desired TEP x 5
A new type of Creature	The creature's Entropic Budget (EB) x 10
A new Law of Magic	1000+ EP (GM Discretion)

This process can be collaborative. Multiple characters can pool their sacrificed TEP to fund a single, grand creation.

### 3.3 · Step 3: The Resonance Test (The Consequence)
A new creation does not enter a void; it enters a universe with existing laws and harmonies. The GM takes the player's blueprint and entropic investment and runs a Resonance Test. This is a narrative challenge where the GM personifies the existing laws of reality. The outcome of this "debate" determines the final form of the creation and, crucially, any unintended consequences (Residue Events). A powerful but hastily designed creation might have dangerous side effects, becoming a new source of conflict and adventure for the world.

## §4 · Example: The Golem of the Iron Heart
A party of high-level adventurers decides to create a new type of sentinel to guard their city.

The Concept: The party's Artificer player designs a new creature: "The Golem of the Iron Heart." They write a detailed module for it, specifying its body parts, attributes, and a unique ability to share its defensive EP with nearby allies. They succeed on a DC 35 Intelligence check.

The Investment: The Golem is designed with an Entropic Budget of 150 EP. The cost to create the first one is 150 x 10 = 1500 TEP. This is beyond any single character. The five members of the party each agree to sacrifice 300 TEP from their own maximum pools to fund the creation.

The Resonance Test: The GM runs the test. The universe "pushes back" on the concept of a golem that can share its essence so freely. The unintended consequence is that when the Golem takes massive damage, a portion of that damage is psychically echoed to all those it is protecting. The players have their guardian, but it comes with a new and dangerous risk.

## §5 · Assemblé
The ultimate expression of a coherent will is not to master the rules of the world, but to write new ones. Metaphysical Engineering is the final stage of a hero's journey, where they transition from the protagonist of a story to an author of the stories yet to come. By sacrificing a piece of their own soul, they leave a permanent, resonant mark on reality—a new song for the world to sing. This is the art of creation, and it is the truest and most lasting form of power.
