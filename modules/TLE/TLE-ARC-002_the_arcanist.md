Level 20 Summary: Combat Strategy
The Level 20 Arcanist is the ultimate "glass cannon," a master of control and overwhelming magical force.

Overwhelming Power: The Arcanist's primary strength is their massive pool of arcane energy. With the Entropic Font feat, they have a combined pool of 117 EP dedicated to their magic. Their +12 INT Modifier allows them to control this power with incredible precision, making their spells both devastating and accurate.

Battlefield Control: An Arcanist specializing in "Expression of Frost" can reshape the battlefield. They can spend EP to create vast walls of ice (TLE-004), flash-freeze the ground to create difficult terrain, or encase enemies in prisons of ice, all while staying at a safe distance.

Calculated Defense: While physically fragile, the Arcanist is not defenseless. Their "Abjuration" skill allows them to spend EP on magical shields and wards, and their high WIS Modifier (+5) makes them resistant to mental and social attacks.

Weaknesses: With only 11 HP and a STR Score of 0, the Arcanist is exceptionally vulnerable to physical damage. Any enemy that can close the distance and bypass their magical defenses can neutralize them with a single, well-placed blow. Their strategy is entirely dependent on maintaining distance, controlling the flow of the battle, and eliminating threats before they can get close.
