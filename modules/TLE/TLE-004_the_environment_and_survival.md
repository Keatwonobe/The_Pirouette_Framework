## §1 · Preamble: The World as a Character
The world itself is the oldest and most powerful entity a character will ever encounter. It is not a static backdrop for adventure, but an active, often hostile, participant in the story. This module provides the rules for treating the environment as a character with its own will, its own actions, and its own resources, and introduces the final form of combat: the struggle for survival.

## §2 · Environmental Budgeting
To understand the environment, one must first measure its will. Every region, from a serene meadow to a raging volcano, has an Entropy Budget that defines its nature and power.

### 2.1 · Quadrant Budgeting
A GM can quickly estimate the power of a region by calculating its Entropy Budget.

Formula: For a quick estimate, a GM can use a baseline of 45,000 EP per sentient inhabitant per day. This budget represents the total entropic output of the region's ecosystem.

Resolution: By comparing the budget of a settlement to the budget of the quadrant it's in, a GM can instantly gauge its significance. A small camp's destruction is a minor event. The fall of a major trading post could destabilize the entire region.

## §3 · The Environment in Combat
The environment is an ever-present entity that can act on its own initiative.

### 3.1 · Hazards as Minigames
Environmental hazards are not just passive damage sources; they are active opponents.

Mechanic: A hazard like a roaring fire or a blizzard has its own Entropy Pool and acts on its own turn. It can "attack" characters within its area of effect, forcing them to use Active Defense to resist being burned or frozen.

Forced Movement: If a hazard would push a character (e.g., a gust of wind, a rushing river), for every 5 feet the character cannot move, the remaining entropic force is dealt as damage.

### 3.2 · Traps & Lingering Entropy
Entropy that is stored externally to a host (in a magical trap, for instance) remains in the environment if the host dies. This can lead to ancient, masterfully crafted traps that are still lethally potent centuries after their creator has perished.

### 3.3 · Entropic Corruption
The environment reacts to the will imposed upon it.

The Rule: For every 2 EP a character spends on a magical effect (that is not simply moving an existing element), the environment in that 5x5 cube loses 1 EP from its budget.

The Consequence: Over time, a fire mage's sanctum will become a cold, ashen wasteland. A paladin's holy ground, site of many smites, will blacken and corrupt. This makes places of great magical power deeply scarred and often dangerous, requiring constant maintenance to remain stable.

The Exception: Spells that simply move or shape existing elements (e.g., controlling water, raising a wall of earth) do not cause corruption. This "natural" magic works in harmony with the environment.

### 3.4 · Shaping the Environment
An entity can create or shape matter from raw entropy.

Formula: Creating a 5x5x5 foot cube of a simple element (earth, ice, etc.) costs 5 EP. This scales linearly. A 10-foot-tall, 60-foot-long wall of ice would cost (10/5) * (60/5) * 5 = 2 * 12 * 5 = 120 EP.

Weaponizing the Environment: A shaped element can be used as an attack. A 5x5x5 foot block of ice can be hurled to deal 1d5 damage.

### 3.5 Light Levels

Light in the world can take one of nine levels: Total darkness > Fuzzy outlines > Vague Shapes > Dim Light > Normal Light > Full Light > Bright Light > Blinding Light > Total Whiteout

Characters can see normally in dim, normal and full light while taking a penalty to the TN of any attack or skill check made in other tiers based on how far away form perceptible it is. The target number goes up by 3 for each tier of light outside of visible light. 

Lights begin and end, meaning there is darkenss beyond them. Total Whiteout and Darkness require perceiving a target to make an attack. Feats that grant sight change or nullify these effects.

### 3.6 Poison

Poisons and venoms are like an item in that each has its own rules, but generic "venom" or "acme poison" would poison constitution directly, removing EP from it each round while poisoned. That means eventually ERR goes to 0 and death.

The Poisoned State: Some attacks do more than tear flesh; they corrupt the very essence of a being. A creature afflicted with the Poisoned state has had its entropic form compromised. At the end of its turn, a poisoned creature must make a Constitution check against the poison's potency. On a failure, they lose a specified amount of EP directly from their Constitution attribute pool, representing their body's struggle to maintain coherence. This loss reduces their Constitution Score and, consequently, their Entropy Regeneration Rate. If a creature's Constitution EP is reduced to 0, it perishes.

Mastering Potency (Alchemy): For those without a natural venom, poison is a craft to be mastered. By taking the Professional Aptitude (Alchemy) feat, a character can learn to brew toxins. The alchemist can invest additional TEP directly into their Alchemy skill beyond the initial feat investment. This invested EP represents their growing knowledge and serves as the dedicated pool from which they can enhance the potency of the poisons they create, making each dose more difficult to resist.

Mastering Potency (Biology): For some creatures, venom is not a craft; it is an extension of their own being. A character with a venomous Utility Limb (such as a stinger or fangs) can invest TEP directly into that limb's dedicated pool. This investment represents a biological optimization—a diet, meditative practice, or resonant focus—that refines and concentrates their natural toxins. The EP invested in the limb determines the potency of the venom it delivers.

## §4 · Survival as Combat
Foraging and surviving in the wild is the third and final form of combat. It is a contest between a character's will and the will of the environment itself.

### 4.1 · The Survival Encounter
When characters attempt to live off the land, they roll for initiative. The environment is their opponent.

The Opponent: The environment's "attributes" and "health pools" are derived from its Entropy Budget. A lush forest is a low-level opponent with plentiful resources. A barren desert is a high-level foe that is actively hostile.

The Health Pools: In a survival encounter, a environment's four core attributes (STR, DEX, INT, WIS) are their health pools. The environment will "attack" the HP character pools with various challenges.

### 4.2 · The Contest
The environment is not trying to have a conversation; it is trying to kill you.

Mechanic: The GM presents challenges that target a character's attributes. A chasm might require a Strength check to cross. A patch of poisonous berries requires an Intelligence check to identify. A hidden pitfall requires a Dexterity check to avoid. Failure results in damage as entropy.

The Goal: The players must successfully overcome these challenges to find the resources (food, water, shelter) they need, all while defending their own entropy pools from the environment's relentless assault.

## §5 · Dynamic Terrain: Imposing Your Will
Any being with control over their entropic output can alter the physical state of their surroundings, creating areas of difficult or impassable terrain.

### 5.1 · The Principle of Difficult Terrain
A 5-foot square of terrain that has been made difficult—such as by creating slick ice, grasping thorns, or super-heated air—impedes movement.

Movement Cost: To move through a 5-foot square of difficult terrain, a creature must succeed on a d2 roll. On a result of 1, their movement for the turn ends, though they still expend 5 feet of movement.

Creating Difficult Terrain: As an action, a character can spend 3 EP to make a 5-foot square within 30 feet into difficult terrain.

Intensifying Terrain: A character can intensify an existing patch of difficult terrain by spending an additional 5 EP. For each 5 EP spent in this way, a creature must make one additional successful d2 roll to pass through the 5-foot square.

Verticality & Falling: Each d2 roll required to move through a space is considered the equivalent of 5 feet of movement for the purposes of verticality. A creature falling through a 15-foot cube of turbulent air would need to make three successful d2 rolls to stop their fall; failure would result in them taking fall damage.

### 5.2 · The Principle of Persistence
Entropic manipulation of the environment is not a fleeting effect that requires concentration. It is a physical change to the world that decays slowly over time.

Duration: A patch of dynamically created difficult terrain remains in effect for one day per EP spent on its creation and intensification. A patch of terrain created with an initial 3 EP and intensified once with 5 EP (total 8 EP) would last for eight days (or until its entropy is exhausted by the environment like ice melting in the sun).

## §6 · Entropic Zones: The Arcane Battlefield
The environment can be viewed as a grid of 5-foot squares, each with its own entropic state. Powerful beings can engage in a battle of wills not by targeting each other directly, but by vying for control over these environmental zones.

### 6.1 · Establishing Control
As an action, a caster can invest EP from a relevant Arcane Skill pool into a 5-foot square within line of sight. This square is now a Controlled Zone. The amount of EP invested determines the strength of their control.

Example: A pyromancer invests 10 EP into a square (5 centered, with 2, 1, 1, 1 surrounding), causing it to smolder and glow with heat. A progenitor druid invests 8 EP into an adjacent square (4 centered with 1, 1, 1, 1 surrounding), causing thick, thorny vines to sprout.

### 6.2 · Contesting a Zone
If a caster targets a Zone that is already controlled by another being, a contest of wills begins.

The Overwhelm: The new caster invests their desired amount of EP. The being with the higher total EP invested in that Zone now controls it. The lesser investment is overwhelmed and its effect is nullified.

The Stalemate: If both casters have invested the exact same amount of EP, the Zone becomes a Contested Zone. The two elemental forces clash violently, creating a chaotic and dangerous area (e.g., a fiery vortex of thorns) that is hostile to all creatures.

### 6.3 · Propagation of Influence
A caster can use their Controlled Zones as a focal point to spread their influence across the battlefield.

The Rule of Adjacency: As an action, a caster can target any 5-foot square that is adjacent to one of their existing Controlled Zones, even if they do not have a direct line of sight to the new square. This allows a caster to "grow" their influence, spreading fire from a smoldering patch or having frost creep across the floor from a frozen spot. This makes establishing and maintaining a foothold on the battlefield a critical tactical objective.

## §7 · The Principle of Becoming
The question "Where do you come from?" is one of the most complex in the multiverse. While the act of courtship and romance is a cherished and common path to creating new life, it is but one thread in a vast and intricate tapestry. Origin stories are as varied as the beings themselves, and the answer "like everyone else" is a rarity. Family is a bond of will, not merely a matter of birth.

### §7.1 · Paths to Being
- Born of a Dream
Among some ancient and fey-touched lineages, new life is not conceived but discovered. An Elven dream priestess might walk the ethereal pathways of a sleeping mind and find, within a particularly innocent or powerful dream, a nascent soul. With gentle care, she can coax this dream-stuff into the waking world, where it coalesces into a new child, its first cries still echoing with the logic of slumber.

- Carved from the Earth
For beings deeply connected to the bones of the world, creation is an act of craft. Gnomish parents, for example, might spend years carving the perfect vessel for their child from a block of ancient wood or a sacred geode. When the form is complete, they perform a ritual to invite a spirit to inhabit it, and the carved figure awakens with the sturdiness of stone and the slow, deep wisdom of the earth.

- Forged by Nature
Some of the most powerful beings are not born of other beings at all, but are direct manifestations of the world's raw, chaotic power. A Giant might be born when a volcano rages, its body forming from a boulder of cooling magma. A roaring thunderstorm might birth a Storm Giant from a hailstone of impossible size that crashes to the earth. These beings are not children in the traditional sense, but living embodiments of a moment of profound natural force.

- Uplifted from the Wild
The bond between a druid and the natural world is so deep that it can transcend the boundaries of species. A druidic couple might find a young animal whose parents have perished. Through a powerful ritual of uplift, they can invest a portion of their own will and entropic potential into the creature, granting it sapience and a humanoid form. This child is raised with the instincts of the wild and the loving guidance of its chosen family.

- Willed into Being
In places rich with entropic residue or deep emotional resonance, life can arise spontaneously. An Etceteron—a being made of miscellaneous scraps of glass, cloth, and forgotten things—might be carefully assembled by a lonely soul who needs a friend. Or, it might pull itself from a junk heap, a consciousness born from the lingering memories and chaotic energy of a thousand discarded objects, achieving a life of its own.

- The Primal Font
For some elemental spirits, the source of new life is a finite and precious resource. Water Sprites of a particular glen might vie for control of a sacred spring that, once a year, seeps a single droplet of primal, life-giving liquid. The sprite who claims this droplet can use it to sculpt a new member of their kind, making the act of procreation a yearly contest of skill, cunning, or combat.

- The Dragon's Riddle
The origin of dragons is a paradox. Some are hatched from eggs of gemstone or metal laid by a great matriarch. Others are said to be "raised" from mundane lizards or serpents by an elder dragon's will. Still others are believed to be carved from a single, flawless gem and animated by a ritual that costs the lives of a dozen mages. The dragons themselves remain silent on which story is true, adding another layer to their mystique.

## Equipment & Artifacts

## §8 · Mundane Gear: The Tools of Survival
### 8.1 · Weapons: The Shape of the Strike
The power of a weapon comes not from its type, but from its quality and how it is wielded. All weapons deal damage based on the wielder's invested Entropy; the weapon itself simply provides an edge of efficiency.

Weapon Quality: The damage a weapon adds to a strike is determined by its craftsmanship.

Poor (1d2): A rusty shiv, a poorly-made club.

Fair (1d4): A standard bandit's blade or scavenger's axe.

Good (1d6): A well-crafted weapon from a city smith.

Excellent (1d8): A masterwork piece.

Perfect (1d12): The pinnacle of mundane craftsmanship.

Enchanted (1d13+): See §2.

Wielding Style:

Two-Handed: When you attack with a weapon in two hands, you make a single attack roll, combining the Entropy of two swings into one devastating blow.

One-Handed / Dual-Wield: When attacking with one-handed weapons, you make two separate, faster strikes. You can target the same creature twice or two different creatures.

Reach: A weapon with the "Reach" property (spear, halberd) can be used to make melee attacks against targets up to 10 feet away without any additional EP cost for range.

### 8.2 · Armor & Shields: The Art of Defense
Armor and shields do not have a health pool. Instead, they provide a chance to negate incoming damage through their inherent quality and the wielder's skill.

Armor: When you are hit by an attack, you may roll your armor's protection die. The result is subtracted from the incoming attack's damage as a form of entropic buffering.

Light Armor (Leather, Studded): 1d2 - 1d4

Medium Armor (Scale, Chain): 1d4 - 1d6

Heavy Armor (Plate): 1d6 - 1d8

Masterwork & Magical: 1d10+

Shields: A shield is an active defense tool. When you are targeted by an attack, you can use your reaction to either:

Block: Roll the shield's protection die and subtract the result from the incoming damage.

Deflect: Roll the shield's protection die and subtract the result from the attacker's to-hit roll.

Shield Quality: Bucklers (1 EP block), Wooden Shields (1d2), Steel Shields (1d3+).

## §9 · Enchanted Items & Artifacts
### 9.1 · The Enchanting Process
Enchanting an item is an act of permanent sacrifice, imbuing a piece of your own soul into an object.

The Cost: The base cost to give an item a magical property is a 3 TEP permanent sacrifice. This creates a simple "+1" effect. More powerful effects require a greater sacrifice (e.g., a "+2" effect costs 6 TEP).

Utility Items: Most magical items function as "dummy companions." They have their own small, dedicated EP pool that can only be used to power their specific effect (e.g., Boots of Speed might have a 3 EP pool that recharges, allowing the wearer to spend it on extra movement). This TEP is sacrificed by the creator and does not belong to the wearer.

### 9.2 · Attunement & The Price of Greed
There is no limit to the number of magical items a character can wear, but there is a limit to how much power one soul can safely channel.

The Overload Limit: A character can safely wear and use magical items whose total TEP cost is up to twice their own TEP.

The Risk: If you wear items exceeding this limit, you become Overloaded. Each time you use an ability from any of your magical items, you must roll a die equal to the item's EP cost. If the result is equal to or less than the amount of TEP you are Overloaded by, you permanently lose that much TEP. This lost TEP dissipates into the environment as chaotic Residue.

### 9.3 · Fate-Bound Weapons
A deep bond can be formed between a wielder and their weapon.

The Bond: By permanently investing at least 9 TEP into a single weapon (for damage, effects, or otherwise), it becomes Fate-Bound. A Fate-Bound weapon will always return to its wielder's hand if lost, thrown, or sold.

Contested Ownership: If another being invests more TEP into the weapon than the original owner, the bond is broken and a new one is formed.

## §10 · The Reward Loop
### 10.1 · Harvesting & Foraging
The true wealth of the bottom realm is found in the remains of its strange inhabitants and the potent materials of the land.

The Silent Auction: When harvesting a creature for valuable trophies or foraging for rare materials, the GM determines the total potential value. The player then makes a "silent bid," investing EP from a relevant skill (like Survival or a Professional skill). If the bid meets or exceeds the GM's hidden TN, the harvest is successful. Invest too much and potentially fail. Invest too little and miss out.

### 10.2 · Types of Rewards
Skins & Trimmings: Tiered crafting materials harvested from creatures.

Crafting Recipes: Blueprints for new items, found as diagrams, taught by a master, or reverse-engineered from an existing artifact.

Loot: Physical items, including mundane gear and enchanted artifacts.

Knowledge: Information gained by "conversing" with a location through skills like Investigation or Archaeology. The reward is a new clue, a hidden truth, or a forgotten story.

## §11 · Investing in the World: Land, Lairs & Commerce
Beyond personal gear, a character's true power can be measured by their investment in the world itself—be it a claim of land, a thriving business, or a lair that is a living extension of their will.

### 10.1 · Claiming Land
Land in the wastes is not bought, but won through persistence and strength of will.

The Claim: To claim a piece of land, a character must openly and actively homestead it. The maximum size of this claim in acres cannot exceed the character's TEP at the time the claim is made.

The Trial of Establishment: For the first 90 days, the claim is contested. The homesteader must defend their land from scavengers, beasts, and opportunistic rivals.

Established Holding: After 90 days of successful defense, the owner is considered "established." While major threats may still arise, the chaotic, constant pressure of the trial period subsides.

Purchasing Land: Land within an established territory (like a city or protected village) can be purchased outright, foregoing the trial period.

### 10.2 · Commerce & Guilds
Setting up a business requires navigating the complex social structures of the walking cities.

Merchant Guilds: Most cities have a merchant guild. A craftsman can leave their goods with the guild to be sold at a fixed rate, with the guild taking a cut from the final sale price.

Licensing: To operate an independent shop, one must acquire a license from the city's head of commerce. This is a social or economic challenge, typically requiring an excellent barter of rare goods or a direct entropic trade (an average of 30 TEP per year).

### 10.3 · Consecrated Ground & Sentient Lairs
A being's territory can become a literal extension of their power.

Favored Ground: A character can perform a ritual to consecrate or desecrate a piece of land, aligning it with their own entropic nature. While on this favored ground, the character's ERR is increased by 1.

The Sentient Lair: By making a massive and permanent TEP investment into a location, a character can awaken it, turning their stronghold into a sentient Lair.

The Lair's Sheet: A Lair has its own character sheet, with a TEP, an ERR, and its own initiative in combat.

Lair Actions: On its turn, the Lair can use its ERR to power effects: grasping vines, shifting walls, sudden darkness, etc.

The Final Bastion: The owner of a Lair can, as an action, draw upon the Lair's permanently invested TEP to fuel their own abilities. This makes a villain in their lair a truly formidable foe, as an intruder must fight both the master and their entire domain at once.
