This document is a catalog of the strange, dangerous, and unique creatures that inhabit the entropic landscape of the bottom realm. Each entry provides a mechanical stat block and tactical notes for the Game Master.

- Wheat-Wolf (Hungry Scavenger)
A wolf-hog hybrid with a stocky, powerful body covered in shaggy, wheat-colored fur. Its eyes glow with a feral red light, and sharp, carnivorous tusks jut from its maw. They are relentless pack hunters that stalk the endless fields of the August Jag.

Total Entropy Pool (TEP): 35 EP

Attributes (5 EP):

STR: 2 EP (Score 1, Mod +0)

DEX: 2 EP (Score 1, Mod +0)

CON: 1 EP (Score 0, Mod +0)

INT: 0 EP (Score 0, Mod +0)

WIS: 0 EP (Score 0, Mod +0)

Physical Form (30 EP):

Torso: 1 EP

Head: 1 EP + 2 Size Entropy (for Tusks)

Standard Limbs (Legs, x4): 24 EP (6 EP each)

Senses (Eyes x2, Scent Organ x1): 3 EP

Max HP: 1 + floor(0.5 * 24) = 13 HP

Movement: 60 feet (Two pairs of Standard Limbs)

Skills & Feats: None

Actions:

Tusk Gore: Melee Attack. Spends Size Entropy from its Head to deal damage.

Tactics: Wheat-wolves are simple pack hunters. They use their superior speed to surround a target, and then the pack alpha will charge in to make the first attack. They are not tactically brilliant and will fight until slain or until their alpha is killed, at which point the rest of the pack will flee.

Residue: Tusks, Pelt, Heart (Low-value Residue).

- Nomad Bandit (Template)
The wastes are home to nomadic camps that shadow the great walking cities. These "second cities" are a haven for criminals, scavengers, and those who cannot or will not live by the strict rules of the city-states. Bandits from these camps are survivors, more interested in a quick score than a fair fight.

Total Entropy Pool (TEP): 50 EP (Bandit Thug)

Archetype (Roll 1d6):

Juggernaut: High STR, focuses on intimidation and heavy melee.

Arcanist: A desperate hedge-mage with one damaging elemental skill.

Phantom: A classic rogue with high DEX and a "Subterfuge" skill pool.

Weaver: A "blood-sculptor" who uses their art to inflict minor wounds.

Sentinel: Wears scavenged armor and uses a makeshift shield.

Drifter: A nimble skirmisher who uses dirty tricks to create difficult terrain.

Attributes, Form, & Skills: Distribute the 50 TEP according to the rolled archetype. Most will have a standard Humanoid form (18 EP).

Tactics: Bandits are opportunists. They will try to ambush their targets and use their numbers to their advantage. They are not zealots; a bandit reduced to half their HP will almost always attempt to flee or surrender. Their goal is to steal TEP (in the form of trophies) or valuable barter items, not to die for a cause.

Residue: Scavenged gear, a single trophy representing their primary skill (e.g., a spell focus, a lockpick, a blood-stained rag).

- Hole Hag
A terrifying shade born of the countless bodies buried unceremoniously beneath the wheat fields. It appears as a gaunt, shadowy form with long, grasping arms made of compacted soil and root. It does not wish to kill, but to drag the living down into the suffocating darkness from which it came.

Total Entropy Pool (TEP): 95 EP

Physical Form (15 EP):

Torso: 1 EP

Head: 1 EP

Standard Limbs (Arms, x2): 6 EP

Senses (Resonant Sense): 1 EP

Utility Limb (Burrowing Form): 4 EP

Max HP: 1 + floor(0.5 * 6) = 4 HP

Skills & Feats (40 EP):

Skill Pool: "Subterfuge": 30 EP (Used for its initial stealth)

Feat: Gloom-Sight (8 EP)

Feat: Kinetic Conversion (2 EP from CON)

Abilities:

Burrow: The Hole Hag can move through earth and soil as if it were open air. It cannot be targeted unless it is on the surface or something has burrowed to touch range.

Grave Grasp: Melee Attack. On a hit, the target is grappled. The Hole Hag can then use its action on subsequent turns to drag the grappled victim 5 feet underground. A creature dragged underground is considered Smothered.

Tactics: The Hole Hag is an ambush predator. It will lie in wait, using its Subterfuge pool to remain hidden. When a target passes over it, it will erupt from the ground and attempt to use Grave Grasp. If it successfully grabs a victim, it will immediately disappear back underground, dragging its prey with it. The only way to fight it effectively is to have a prepared action to strike the moment it appears.

Residue: A heart of compacted, grave-soiled earth (Uncommon Residue).

## Wastes Fauna & Horrors
- Zug
An enormous, hyper-territorial rat-mole hybrid that carves massive tunnel systems beneath the August Jag. Its powerful forelimbs allow it to burrow with terrifying speed, and its sheer bulk makes it the ursine equivalent of the wheat fields. Zugs mate for life, and where there is one, another is surely nearby.

Utility Limb (Burrowing Form): 4 EP

Max HP: 21 + floor(0.5 * (46 + 6)) = 47 HP

Abilities:

Burrow: The Zug can move through earth and soil at its full movement speed.

Terrifying Roar: As an action, the Zug can emit a deafening roar. All creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a Wisdom check (TN 15) or be frightened for one round.

Tactics: A Zug is a straightforward brawler. It will often start a fight by bursting from the ground, using its Terrifying Roar to stun its prey, and then focusing its powerful claw attacks on the largest single threat.

Residue: Zug Claws, Pelts, Heart (High-value Residue).

- Pasty ("Skin")
The bitter end of a desperate soul, bleached and animated by ambient entropic energy. These eyeless undead are drawn inexorably to the scent of unlooted Residue. They do not shuffle, but run headlong towards their prey, their bodies little more than a delivery system for their grasping hands.

DEX: 5 EP (Score 2, Mod +0)

CON: 0 EP (Score 0, Mod +0)

INT: 0 EP (Score 0, Mod +0)

WIS: 0 EP (Score 0, Mod +0)

Physical Form (50 EP): Standard Humanoid (18 EP) with the rest invested as Size Entropy in its Torso for a reckless charge.

Max HP: 1 + 32 (Size) + floor(0.5 * 12) = 39 HP

Abilities:

Residue Sense: A Pasty automatically knows the location of any unharvested corpse within 1 mile.

Headlong Charge: A Pasty moves chest-first. It cannot take the Dodge action, but its first slam attack in a round deals bonus damage equal to its Torso's Size Entropy.

Tactics: Pasties are simple. They sense Residue and run directly towards it, attacking any living creature in their path. They fight mindlessly until destroyed.

- The Crazed (Template)
Not all can withstand the constant, chaotic pressure of the bottom realm. The Crazed are those whose minds have shattered, their bodies warped into unpredictable vessels of madness. They are tragic, dangerous, and utterly unpredictable.

Total Entropy Pool (TEP): 65 EP

Abilities:

Unstable Movement: When The Crazed uses its movement, it does not move normally. For every 5 feet it would move, roll 1d4. It teleports that many 5-foot squares in a random direction.

Tactics: The Crazed are erratic. They will attack the nearest creature, friend or foe, with their bare fists. Their random movement makes them a chaotic element in any battle, as likely to teleport into a pit as they are to appear behind a player.

- Skinbird
The apex predator of the wheat wastes. A terrifying, pterodactyl-like beast with a fleshy, maned neck and a long, muscular tail tipped with three venomous barbs. Its call is a deafening crack of thunder that can be heard for miles. It preys on Zugs, and anything else foolish enough to draw its attention.

Utility Limb (Venom Gland): 4 EP + 10 Size Entropy

Senses (x2): 2 EP

Max HP: 21 + floor(0.5 * (60 + 22 + 14)) = 69 HP

Abilities:

Thunderous Cry: As an action, the Skinbird can unleash its call. All creatures within 120 feet must succeed on a CON check (TN 18) or be deafened for one minute.

Paralytic Venom: A creature hit by the Skinbird's tail barb must make a CON check (TN 20). On a failure, they lose 5 EP from their Constitution pool and are paralyzed for one round.

Tactics: The Skinbird is a patient hunter. It will circle high above, using its Thunderous Cry to disorient prey before diving. It will use its tail to paralyze a target, then land to finish it with its powerful beak and wings.

Residue: Skinbird Beak, Venom Glands, Heart (Legendary-value Residue).

- Swarms (Template)
A single rat is a pest. A thousand rats, united by a singular, wrathful will, are a tide of death. A swarm is not a collection of creatures, but a single entity with a shared pool of HP and a singular purpose.

Mechanics: A swarm of tiny creatures occupies a 10x10 foot space. It has a single HP pool and TEP. It is immune to effects that target a single creature. It can move through any opening large enough for one of its component creatures.

Swarm Attack: As an action, the swarm attacks all creatures within its space.

Example: Haunted Rat Swarm (TEP 75): A swarm of rats possessed by a vengeful spirit. Its swarm attack deals minor physical damage and forces a Wisdom check to avoid being frightened.

- Lamb Lion
A patient and horrifying ambush predator. This creature, a nightmarish fusion of a praying mantis and a spider, digs a pit in a well-traveled path, covers it with a fragile lid of woven wheat, and waits. It prefers to eat its prey alive, limb by limb.

Total Entropy Pool (TEP): 120 EP

Attributes (50 EP):

STR: 30 EP (Score 15, Mod +3)

DEX: 15 EP (Score 7, Mod +1)

CON: 5 EP (Score 2, Mod +0)

Physical Form (70 EP):

Torso: 1 EP + 10 Size Entropy

Head: 1 EP + 10 Size Entropy (Mandibles)

Utility Limbs (Mantis Claws, x2): 8 EP + 30 Size Entropy

Standard Limbs (Legs, x6): 18 EP

Senses (Compound Eyes x2): 2 EP

Max HP: 11 + floor(0.5 * (38 + 18)) = 39 HP

Abilities:

Ambush Hunter: The Lamb Lion spends its day creating its trap. The TN to spot the trap is 20.

Mantis Grapple: On a successful hit with its claws, the target is grappled.

Devour Limb: As an action, the Lamb Lion can begin devouring a limb of a grappled creature, dealing 1d10 damage. The TN to escape the grapple increases by the damage dealt this way. If a creature is held for 3 consecutive rounds, the limb is severed permanently.

Tactics: The Lamb Lion is a patient trapper. Once it has its prey, it will focus exclusively on devouring it, ignoring other threats unless it takes significant damage. It prefers not to leave its pit.

- Crow-Man (Silent Watcher)
A mysterious, secretive being that appears as a scarecrow-like figure wrapped in dark cloth. They are the silent guardians of the deep wastes, using swarms of crows as their eyes and wings. Their culture and motivations are a complete unknown, even to the Lepi.

Total Entropy Pool (TEP): 100 EP

STR: 5 EP (Score 2, Mod +0)

DEX: 15 EP (Score 7, Mod +1)

INT: 10 EP (Score 5, Mod +1)

WIS: 20 EP (Score 10, Mod +2)

Physical Form (18 EP): Standard Humanoid

Skills & Feats (32 EP):

Arcane Skill "Primal Weaving": 10 EP

Feat: Thousand Forms Adept (12 EP) (Specialized in Crow Swarms)

Feat: Gloom-Sight (8 EP)

Tactics: Crow-Men are observers, not warriors. They will watch intruders from a distance. If bothered, they will use their Primal Weaving to harass with minor druidic spells (entangling vines, gusts of wind) before transforming into a crow swarm to escape. They are fiercely territorial but not inherently aggressive.

- Heresy (The Nothing That Is)
The fallen emperor of the Skazan, a howling wound in the world. Heresy is not a creature to be fought, but a force of nature to be survived. It appears as a tall, masked figure buzzing with flies, a being of pure, unmaking void. To attack it is to invite your own annihilation.

Total Entropy Pool (TEP): -500 EP (Acts as a positive value for all contests)

Attributes: All attributes are conceptually negative, granting it an overwhelming advantage in any contested check.

Abilities:

Aura of Dread: Creatures that start their turn within 120 feet of Heresy must succeed on a Wisdom check (TN 25) or be frightened.

Cannot Be Harmed: Heresy is "nothing." It is immune to all damage and effects. All attacks against it automatically miss.

Integration: If a creature attacks Heresy, it uses its reaction to integrate with the attacker. The attacker is instantly and irrevocably erased from existence. There is no save.

Tactics: Heresy is a pursuit predator. It does not run; it walks with a relentless, terrifying pace. It will lock onto a single target and pursue them for miles. The only goal is to escape. It is a narrative event, a chase, and a test of stamina, not a combat encounter.

## Civilized & Sapient Peoples
This section details the various sapient peoples who have built societies in the bottom realm, from the ancient natives to the immortal survivors and their mortal descendants. Each entry provides a brief description and a standard "Body Plan" template for character creation.

- Heresy, Minor
Half-truths and forgotten whispers given form, these enigmatic beings crew the quaint wooden cities that wander the wastes. They are flighty, speak in riddles, and value the tone of a conversation over its literal content. They are powerful allies if you can learn to dance to their tune.

Body Plan (Variable Cost): Heresies have no fixed form and can be built using any combination of body parts. They are often ethereal or strangely assembled.

- Village Commoner
The mortal descendants of the first immortal survivors. They live in established villages deep within the wastes, leading normal lives and dying of old age. They are wary of the "hunted," as their presence often brings the wrath of the Skazan Order down upon them.

Body Plan (18 EP): Standard Humanoid form.

- Lepi
The original natives of the plane, these moth-like people are hardy survivors and neutral arbiters in the conflicts of the realm. Their patterned wings are their pride, and their knowledge of the wastes is unparalleled. They are the only faction that treats openly with the Skazan.

Body Plan (20 EP):

Torso: 1 EP, Head: 1 EP, Arms (x2): 6 EP, Legs (x2): 6 EP, Wings (x2): 8 EP, Antennae Senses (x2): 2 EP

Max HP: 1 + floor(0.5 * (12 + 8)) = 11 HP

- Graff
Pangolin-armadillo hybrids, the Graff are hardy desert dwellers who loot ancient ruins. They are large, scaly, and can roll into a ball for both defense and high-speed travel.

Body Plan (23 EP):

Torso: 1 EP + 4 Size Entropy (Carapace), Head: 1 EP, Arms (x2): 6 EP, Legs (x2): 6 EP, Senses (x2): 2 EP, Utility Limb (Carapace): 4 EP

Max HP: 5 + floor(0.5 * 12) = 11 HP

- Boncit
Woodpecker-folk with a unique biological adaptation. They can strike with their heads and beaks with incredible force, using a specialized utility limb in their head for both offense and defense.

Body Plan (19 EP):

Torso: 1 EP, Arms (x2): 6 EP, Legs (x2): 6 EP, Senses (x2): 2 EP, Utility Limb (Reinforced Head/Beak): 4 EP

Max HP: 1 + floor(0.5 * 12) = 7 HP

- Saltician
Jumping spider-folk who are masters of explosive movement. They use all six of their limbs to launch themselves through the air. Some bloodlines are known to have a venomous bite.

Body Plan (26 EP):

Torso: 1 EP, Head: 1 EP, Standard Limbs (x6): 18 EP, Compound Eyes (x2): 2 EP, Utility Limb (Fangs, optional): 4 EP

Max HP: 1 + floor(0.5 * 18) = 10 HP

- Gage Mage
Elephant-folk of immense stature and intellect. They are often scholars and magi, though their physical power is not to be underestimated. A strange quirk of their biology sometimes causes the eldest among them to become unnaturally light.

Body Plan (20 EP):

Torso: 1 EP, Head: 1 EP, Arms (x2): 6 EP, Legs (x2): 6 EP, Senses (x2): 2 EP, Basic Limb (Trunk): 2 EP, Utility Limb (Tusks): 2 EP

Max HP: 1 + floor(0.5 * 16) = 9 HP

- Sha Reqa
Living elementals bound to a matrix of obsidian or other stone. Their "head" is a utility limb of pure, swirling energy, and their forms can be bizarre and asymmetrical. They are often graceful and unnervingly swift.

Body Plan (Variable Cost): Built from a Torso, a Head (Utility Limb, Pure Element), and any number of Standard or Basic Limbs made of stone.

- Chot
An empire of grasshopper-folk who dominate the dry wastes. They are a hive society, fiercely loyal to their queen-patrons. They ride massive katydids into battle and are known for their territorial raids.

Body Plan (22 EP):

Torso: 1 EP, Head: 1 EP, Arms (x2): 6 EP, Legs (x2 for jumping): 6 EP, Basic Limbs (x2 for stability): 4 EP, Senses (x2): 2 EP

Max HP: 1 + floor(0.5 * 16) = 9 HP

- Pindel
Small, impish beings with horns, wings, and a prehensile tail. Their skin is often brightly colored like a tropical bird, and some are known to be poisonous to the touch. They are mischievous and curious.

Body Plan (21 EP):

Torso: 1 EP, Head: 1 EP, Arms (x2): 6 EP, Legs (x2): 6 EP, Wings (x2): 8 EP, Basic Limb (Tail): 2 EP, Senses (x2): 2 EP

Max HP: 1 + floor(0.5 * (12 + 8 + 2)) = 12 HP

- Setabo
Poison-dart frog folk who are small, agile, and deadly. Their skin is coated in a toxic mucus, but this adaptation comes at a cost: they must remain hydrated, requiring regular bathing to survive.

Body Plan (18 EP):

Torso: 1 EP, Head: 1 EP, Arms (x2): 6 EP, Legs (x2): 6 EP, Senses (x2): 2 EP, Utility Limb (Poison Glands): 2 EP
