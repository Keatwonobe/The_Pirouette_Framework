## §1 · Preamble: The Contested Will
The purest expression of power is not the force of a blow, but the imposition of one's will upon another. This module details the mechanics of control, from the physical struggle of a grapple to the subtle war of a tense negotiation. It defines the rules for subverting an opponent's mind, cursing their form, raising the dead, and engaging in the high-stakes combat of conversation.

## §2 · Physical Control: The Grapple
A grapple is a contested roll to determine physical dominance, relying on both power and technique.

Mechanic: To initiate or escape a grapple, both entities make a contested roll. The roll is a combination of their physical attributes.
Grapple Check = d20 + STR Modifier + DEX Modifier

Resolution: The higher roll wins. A successful grapple can render an opponent immobile, prevent them from using certain limbs, or create an opportunity for a follow-up attack. A nimble rogue with high Dexterity can just as easily pin a powerful knight as the other way around, representing a victory of technique over brute force.

## §3 · Mental & Arcane Control
The most potent forms of control bypass the physical entirely, targeting an entity's mind and will.

### 3.1 · Mind Control
This is a direct assault on an entity's Intelligence score.

Mechanic: The attacker makes a contested roll of their (d20 + INT Mod + WIS Mod) against the target's (d20 + INT Mod + WIS Mod). If the attacker wins, they temporarily reduce the target's Intelligence Score by the difference.

The Handicap: For each point the target's Intelligence Score is pushed into the negative, they suffer an "entropy handicap." Any action they attempt that is not permitted by the controller costs an additional EP equal to their negative Intelligence Score.

Full Control: If the handicap becomes greater than the target's Entropy Regeneration Rate, they are effectively puppeted by the controller, who can now spend their own Actions to command the target.

Caster Cost: EP spent to maintain a mind control effect is locked and cannot be regenerated until the effect is released.

### 3.2 · Curses
A curse is a malicious reallocation of a target's own entropy. A werewolf's curse, for example, might forcibly drain all EP invested in Intelligence and Wisdom and dump it into Strength and Dexterity, creating a powerful but mindless beast.

### 3.3 · Necromancy & Summoning
A necromancer or summoner externalizes their own will, giving it form.

Mechanic: The caster "releases" a portion of their TEP, which becomes the TEP for the summoned creature. The caster cannot regenerate this released EP until the minion is destroyed or dismissed.

Minion Upgrades: A necromancer can store additional released EP in artifacts like rings or phylacteries, allowing them to maintain a larger or more powerful retinue of undead. The minion's body is constructed using the same rules as a player character (TLE-002).

### 3.4 · Intangible Grapples
Spells like a telekinetic grasp function as a grapple but use the caster's (d20 + INT Mod + WIS Mod) against the target's (d20 + STR Mod + DEX Mod). This makes a powerful mage a dangerous grappling threat, capable of pinning foes from a distance.

## §4 · Conversation as Combat
Social interaction is not a passive skill check; it is a dynamic battle of wits, presence, and will. "Charisma" is not an attribute, but the successful application of tactics in conversational combat.

### 4.1 · Entering the Conversation
Any attempt to persuade, deceive, intimidate, or haggle with a significant NPC initiates conversational combat. Both sides roll for initiative (d20 + DEX Modifier), and the normal rules for initiative order apply.

### 4.2 · The Mental Battlefield
A conversation has its own "health pools."

Resolve: An entity's Intelligence Score. Represents their logical fortitude and ability to resist deception.

Composure: An entity's Wisdom Score. Represents their emotional stability and willpower.

### 4.3 · Statements as Actions
An entity can make a number of "statements" (actions) per turn based on their attributes, as defined in TLE-004. Each statement is a social "attack."

Mechanic: The attacker makes a contested roll based on their approach. Intimidation might be a (d20 + STR Mod) check, while a clever persuasion might be a (d20 + INT Mod) check.

Damage: If the attacker wins, they deal "damage" equal to the EP they spent on the statement. This damage is split evenly between the target's Resolve and Composure, rounded down.

Vulnerability: Attacking the lower of the two mental pools is the key to victory. A brilliant but emotionally fragile academic is vulnerable to appeals to their ego (targeting Composure).

### 4.4 · The Stakes of Conversation
Reducing a target's mental pools to a negative value does not grant the attacker mind control, but it does achieve a social victory.

Outcome: A "defeated" opponent might be persuaded to lower their prices, convinced of your argument for the moment, or intimidated into backing down.

Impermanence: Just like in the real world, the effects of a single conversation are rarely permanent. Water carves canyons over time. A convinced opponent may change their mind later, and an intimidated foe may return with reinforcements.
