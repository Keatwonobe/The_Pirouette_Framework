## §1 · Purpose
To selectively isolate, retain, or discard components from a dataset or information stream based on their calculated entropy, allowing for the extraction of structured signals from noise, the identification of regions of high complexity/randomness, or the focusing of analysis on elements with specific informational characteristics.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Entropy, as a measure of disorder, uncertainty, or information content (typically Shannon entropy), serves as a powerful criterion for distinguishing between various types of components within a dataset. Structured, predictable, or redundant components tend to exhibit lower entropy, while noisy, random, complex, or novel components tend to exhibit higher entropy. Filtering based on these entropic characteristics allows for the targeted manipulation or extraction of information based on its inherent orderliness or informational richness. This aligns with Pirouette's view of information having phase-like properties (gaseous, liquid, crystalline) with varying entropy.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Entropy (H)**: This is the primary metric used for filtering. Shannon entropy is commonly used, but the concept can extend to other entropy measures.
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: Often inversely correlated with entropy; highly coherent segments (high $T_a$) may have low entropy. Filtering by entropy can sometimes be an indirect way of filtering by coherence, or vice-versa. The $T_a$ of segments passing the filter can be a secondary characteristic of interest.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: If entropy values themselves exhibit periodic fluctuations over a sequence of segments, $K_i$-Harmonic Decomposition could be applied to the entropy series itself, potentially revealing $K_i$-rhythms in the system's complexity dynamics.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: A dataset that has been, or can be, divided into discrete segments or components. For each segment, it must be possible to estimate a probability distribution of its constituent symbols or states to calculate entropy.
* **And Structure**: An array of segments/components, or a data stream that can be processed by a segmentation method (like Stochastic Gulping). Each segment might be a numerical array, a string of symbols, etc.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient number of segments for the filtering to be meaningful, and each segment must contain enough data points for a stable entropy estimate.
* **Steps**: Segmentation of the primary data stream (e.g., using Stochastic Gulping Tendu Module TEN-SG-1.0). Discretization or symbolization of data within segments if necessary to define probabilities for entropy calculation.

### 3·2 · Operational Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `EntropyThresholdLow (H_low)` | The lower bound for entropy filtering (used in HighPass, BandPass, BandStop). | `System-dependent, derived from the entropy distribution of the data.` |
| `EntropyThresholdHigh (H_high)` | The upper bound for entropy filtering (used in LowPass, BandPass, BandStop). | `System-dependent, derived from the entropy distribution of the data.` |
| `FilterType` | Specifies the filtering logic: 'LowPass' (retain H <= H_high), 'HighPass' (retain H >= H_low), 'BandPass' (retain H_low <= H <= H_high), 'BandStop' (discard H_low <= H <= H_high). | `['LowPass', 'HighPass', 'BandPass', 'BandStop']` |
| `EntropyCalculationMethod` | Method used to calculate entropy for each segment (e.g., 'Shannon', 'Tsallis'). | `Default is 'Shannon'.` |

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Input Segments: Receive or generate a collection of data segments $C_j$ (e.g., from Stochastic Gulping or another segmentation process).
2. Entropy Calculation: For each segment $C_j$, calculate its entropy $H(C_j)$ using the chosen `EntropyCalculationMethod`. For Shannon Entropy: $H(C_j) = -\sum_k P(x_k \in C_j) \log_b P(x_k \in C_j)$.
3. Filter Application: For each segment $C_j$ with its entropy $H(C_j)$, apply the filtering logic based on `FilterType` and the defined `EntropyThresholdLow` and/or `EntropyThresholdHigh`.
    - If `FilterType` is 'LowPass': Keep $C_j$ if $H(C_j) \le H_{high}$.
    - If `FilterType` is 'HighPass': Keep $C_j$ if $H(C_j) \ge H_{low}$.
    - If `FilterType` is 'BandPass': Keep $C_j$ if $H_{low} \le H(C_j) \le H_{high}$.
    - If `FilterType` is 'BandStop': Keep $C_j$ if $H(C_j) < H_{low}$ OR $H(C_j) > H_{high}$.
4. Output Generation: Collect all segments $C_j$ that satisfy the filtering criteria to form the filtered dataset $D_{filtered}$. Alternatively, output metadata indicating which original segments were selected or rejected.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: The filtered dataset $D_{filtered}$, containing only those segments/components that passed the entropy-based criteria. Optionally, a list of all input segments with their entropy values and a flag indicating if they were selected.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Isolation of data components with specific characteristics of order, disorder, predictability, or novelty. For example, a low-pass entropy filter can help isolate structured signals from high-entropy noise. A high-pass filter can identify regions of unusual complexity or randomness which might be anomalies or innovation zones. This can enhance signal-to-noise ratios or focus subsequent analyses on specific types of informational content.
* **Guidelines**: Low entropy segments typically represent order, predictability, redundancy, or 'crystalline' information. High entropy segments represent disorder, randomness, novelty, high information content, or 'gaseous' information. The choice of filter type and thresholds depends on the analytical goal: e.g., to find structure, use low-pass; to find anomalies or novelty, use high-pass.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Shannon Entropy Calculation
$$ H(C_j) = -\sum_k P(x_k \in C_j) \log_b P(x_k \in C_j) $$
Calculates the Shannon entropy for a given data segment $C_j$. The base 'b' of the logarithm is typically 2 (for bits) or e (for nats).

### Filtering Logic (Low-Pass Example)
$$ \text{IF } H(C_j) \le H_{high} \text{ THEN Keep } C_j $$
Example of a conditional rule for a low-pass entropy filter, where segments are retained if their entropy is below or equal to a high threshold.

## §7 · Integration & Use Cases
### 7·1 · Integration Hooks
* **Dependencies**: Typically requires segmented data as input. Therefore, often used after a Tendu module like Stochastic Gulping (TEN-SG-1.0), which provides both segments and their initial entropy calculations.
* **Applications**: The filtered dataset can be fed into any other Tendu analytical mode for more focused analysis. For instance, after a low-pass entropy filter, Ki-Harmonic Decomposition might more easily find periodicities in the now 'cleaner' signal.

### 7·2 · Use Cases
* Signal Processing: Removing high-entropy noise from a low-entropy signal of interest, or vice-versa.
* Anomaly Detection: Identifying segments in a data stream with unusually high or low entropy compared to the baseline (e.g., detecting equipment malfunction, fraudulent transactions).
* Text Analysis: Filtering out boilerplate or highly redundant text sections (low entropy) to focus on information-rich content, or identifying passages of high linguistic complexity.
* Image Segmentation: Identifying regions of uniform texture (low entropy) versus complex texture (high entropy).
* Feature Selection in Machine Learning: Selecting features or data segments based on their information content or predictability for model training.
