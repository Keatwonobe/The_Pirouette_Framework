## §1 · Preamble: The Unfolding World
The life of an adventurer is not solely defined by the flash of a blade or the crackle of a spell. It is also shaped by the long roads between destinations, the quiet moments of recovery and creation, and the complex web of needs and resources that binds civilization together. This module provides the rules for the "in-between" time—downtime, travel, and the unique economic landscape of a world scarred by forgotten magic.

## §2 · The Downtime Entropy Budget
During non-combat time (travel, resting, working in a city), an entity's will is not idle. It is constantly generating a pool of potential that can be directed toward a single, focused task. This is the Downtime Entropy Budget.

Mechanic: An entity's Downtime Budget is equal to their Entropy Regeneration Rate (ERR), applied over a given period. This budget can be spent on any single, non-combat task they are capable of performing.

Example Tasks: Healing (TLE-005), Crafting (TLE-004), Research, or maintaining passive awareness.

### 2.1 · The Traveler's Dilemma
Travel is the most common downtime activity, and it presents a crucial choice. An entity moving at their base speed (spending no EP on specialized movement) can apply their full Downtime Budget to a task.

The Choice: A wounded adventurer might dedicate their entire budget to healing, allowing them to recover from battle while on the road. However, by focusing their will inward, they are not spending any entropy on awareness. They make no passive perception checks and are vulnerable to ambush.

The Alternative: A cautious adventurer might dedicate their budget to Vigilance, spending their regenerated EP on constant perception checks to scan for danger. They will be much harder to surprise, but they will not heal any damage they have sustained. This creates a constant, meaningful resource management choice for the party.

## §3 · The World After the Prospero
The current economic and ecological landscape is a direct result of the fall of the Skazan Order and their master mages, the Prospero. The Prospero could create sustenance from their own will, but their magic was a poor defense. In their fall, they unleashed a chaotic torrent of creation that has permanently scarred the world.

The Environment: Vast fields of wild wheat are plagued by ergot, which blows in hallucinogenic fungal storms. Rivers run red and brackish with the remnants of magical wine. Forests are overgrown and filled with colossal, aggressive swarms of bees.

The Remnants: Ancient Skazan constructs still wander the continent on clockwork paths, their original purpose long forgotten. The trails they leave are often the only safe roads through the hazardous wilderness.

## §4 · The Economy of Need
In this strange world, traditional currency is almost worthless. The fall of the Skazan shattered any centralized economy, and the great roaming cities that remain are fiercely independent, each with their own culture and needs.

### 4.1 · Barter as Law
The primary method of exchange is barter. An adventurer's skill, the Entropy Shards they find, or a unique item they've crafted are far more valuable than a pocketful of forgotten coins. Value is determined by immediate, practical need.

### 4.2 · The City Entropy Budget
Every settlement, from a tiny village to a great roaming city, has a collective City Entropy Budget. This is a measure of its overall stability, needs, and ability to withstand threats.

Formula: The GM can estimate a city's budget by multiplying its approximate population by an "Average Individual Budget" (AIB) that reflects the local standard of living.
City Budget = Population * AIB

A Tool for Adventure: This budget is a powerful tool for the GM to generate quests. By comparing the City's Budget to the entropic signature of its surroundings, a clear picture of the city's needs emerges:

If Environment EP > City EP: The city is in immediate danger from an overwhelming external threat (e.g., a massive bee swarm, an approaching fungal storm).

If a High EP Bubble is Nearby: The city may feel threatened by an unknown power and hire adventurers to investigate.

If Environment EP is Low: This signals a problem like a magical blight, a severe drought, or a curse, prompting the city to seek a solution.

## §5 · The Weaponized Profession
Any profession, no matter how mundane, can be weaponized through the focused application of will and Entropy. A character with the Professional Aptitude feat can treat their "Professional" skill pool as a versatile tool for both utility and combat.

The Principle: You can spend EP from your Professional skill pool to fuel actions related to your trade. This is a narrative-first mechanic. A tailor might spend EP to animate needles and send them flying like darts. A blacksmith could spend EP to super-heat a piece of metal and use it as a thrown weapon. A farmer's lethality with a pitchfork is a direct result of the entropic focus they've honed through a lifetime of labor.

Constructs & Companions: A craftsman can create a companion related to their trade (a tailor's animated rug, a blacksmith's clockwork hound). These constructs are created and maintained using the standard Taming & Bonding rules, requiring a significant TEP and ERR investment from their creator.

## §6 · Temporary Enchanting: Imbuing Objects
A character can temporarily invest a portion of their own will into an object they have personally modified, creating a single-use enchanted item.

The Investment: As part of a short rest, you can invest your own EP into an object you have modified (e.g., carving a simple rune, tying a specific knot). This EP is removed from your own TEP and does not regenerate. The object is now "charged."

The Trigger: You must set a trigger condition for the stored Entropy to be released. This can be on contact, on a spoken command word, or when the object is broken.

Detection: A charged object radiates a faint entropic aura. The Target Number to detect this aura is equal to the EP invested. A weakly charged item is thus harder to detect than a powerfully charged one. This can be further concealed by the Veiled Casting feat.

## §7 · Crafting & The Materials Economy
The world is rich with strange and potent materials. A skilled professional can forage for these resources and use them to craft powerful new items.

### 7.1 · Foraging & Material Tiers
All characters with the Professional Aptitude feat are assumed to have the necessary skills to find and identify materials relevant to their trade. The success and quality of these materials are determined by a survival challenge set by the GM. Materials are categorized into four tiers of quality.

Tier 1 & 2 (Common): Can hold a maximum of 5 EP when used in a crafting recipe.

Tier 3 (Uncommon): Can hold a maximum of 20 EP.

Tier 4 (Rare): Can hold a maximum of 50 EP.

### 7.2 · The Crafting Process
Crafting an item requires a recipe, the correct tiered materials, and an investment of the craftsman's own will.

Recipes: A recipe is a blueprint that calls for specific types and tiers of materials (e.g., "one part Tier 3 Metal, two parts Tier 1 Leather").

Crafting ERR: A character can invest additional TEP directly into their Professional skill pool. This investment serves two purposes: it acts as a dedicated pool for weaponizing their profession, and it increases their Crafting ERR, allowing them to complete complex projects more quickly.
