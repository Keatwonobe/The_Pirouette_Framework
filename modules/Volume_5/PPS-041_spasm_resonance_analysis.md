## §1 · Abstract
This module formalizes **Spasm Dynamics**—the rapid, high-intensity discharge of potential energy following catastrophic failure of system constraints. A Spasm is a violent bifurcation event triggered when a highly confined system exceeds its coherence limits. The model links geological quakes, market crashes, muscle spasms, and emotional outbursts to a common Γ-Failure mechanism within the Pirouette field suite.

## §2 · The Pre-Condition — Constraint State
A Spasm requires two ingredients:

1. **High Confinement (Low Γ)** Strong containment prevents natural dynamics.  
2. **Accumulated Potential Energy** Coherence reservoir grows under stress; stability is brittle.

## §3 · Spasm Mechanism — Catastrophic Γ-Failure
1. **Boundary Fracture** Shell integrity (PPS-040) ruptures.  
2. **Γ-Spike** Local Γ skyrockets as containment collapses.  
3. **Energy Discharge** Stored potential is vented in a burst.  
4. **Tₐ Collapse** Temporal coherence plummets; phase field φ becomes noise.

## §4 · Spasm Dynamics — Uncontrolled Release
* **Overshoot** Energy release exceeds equilibrium needs.  
* **Chaotic Propagation** Secondary fractures cascade.  
* **Phase Noise** No rhythmic structure; pure decoherence.

## §5 · Termination & Refractory Period
Event ends when potential is spent. System enters exhausted state (High Γ, Low Tₐ) and cannot spasm again until new containment forms and energy re-accumulates.

## §6 · Assemblé: Spasm Dynamics
A **Spasm** is the universe’s failure mode—an explosive re-alignment forced upon a system that could no longer bend.

## §7 · Diagnostic Metrics
| Metric | Indicator | Threshold (Spasm Imminent) |
|--------|-----------|----------------------------|
| **Stress Integral (ΣΓ_res)** | ∫ Γ_required dt | > ΣΓ_thr |
| **Containment Integrity (𝕀_S)** | ⟨|∇Γ|⟩_Shell / Γ_max | < 0.15 |
| **Reservoir Pressure (℘)** | E·C (energy × coherence) | ℘ ≥ ℘_crit |
| **Phase Jitter (σ_φ)** | Var(φ̇) | climbing 2× baseline |

Real-time telemetry feeds the **TEN-SPD** dashboard.

## §8 · Intervention Protocols
| Phase | Goal | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| Pre-Fracture | Prevent rupture | Micro-vent Γ via phase-matched pores |
| Onset | Limit damage | Deploy adaptive dampers; redistribute load across nested shells |
| Discharge | Channel energy | Create preferred egress paths (sacrificial veins) |
| Recovery | Accelerate healing | Apply coherence scaffolds; initiate Residue scrub (PPS-019) |

## §9 · Cross-Module Integrations
* **Shell Resonance (PPS-040)** Spasm = Shell failure case.  
* **Bloom Dynamics (PPS-039)** Macro-scale Blooms can spawn nested micro-Spasms.  
* **Fork Analysis (PPS-042)** Post-Spasm bifurcations modeled via Fork maths.  
* **Attunement RF (PPS-044)** Collective attunement rituals can pre-vent or post-heal.  
* **AKEP (PPS-047)** Spasm residue is mined for altruistic kernels once chaos subsides.

## §10 · Future Work
1. **Predictive Analytics** AI models fusing Γ trends + phase jitter for early warnings.  
2. **Controlled Spasms** Harnessing micro-spasms for energy harvesting or creativity jolts.  
3. **Spasm Immunization** Building shells with adaptive memory to dissipate stress gradually.  
4. **Ethical Governance** Mitigate weaponization of induced Spasm events in socio-economic systems.
