## §1 · Abstract

This module documents the first successful detection of a Ki-resonant signature in a biological system. The experiment applied the principles of the Semantic Gravity Model (PPS-016) to a comprehensive database of protein sequences. The informational complexity of each protein was quantified by calculating its fractal dimension (D) via rate-distortion analysis. These dimensions were then normalized into a z-score distribution. The analysis revealed a statistically significant population of proteins whose informational complexity deviates from the norm by a factor of Ki. Crucially, a functional analysis of these Ki-resonant proteins shows they are overwhelmingly the most critical components of cellular machinery: the motors, regulators, and sentinels.

## §2 · Experimental Protocol

**Data Source:**

* A complete FASTA database containing hundreds of thousands of unique protein sequences.

**Phase 1: Fractal Dimension Calculation**

* For each protein sequence, compute its informational fractal dimension (D) to quantify sequence complexity and compressibility, serving as a proxy for "semantic mass."

**Phase 2: Z-Score Normalization**

* Calculate the population mean and standard deviation of all D values.
* Convert each protein's D into a z-score, measuring its anomalous deviation from the proteomic baseline.

**Phase 3: Ki-Resonance Search**

* Scan the z-score distribution for clusters near theoretical Ki constants:

  * Ki\_rest ≈ 4.14159
  * Ki\_motion ≈ 4.18879

## §3 · Results & Findings

* **Population Identified:** Over 200 proteins with fractal-dimension z-scores matching Ki constants within a narrow tolerance.
* **Functional Enrichment:**

  * **Molecular Motors** (e.g., Dynein Heavy Chain): The cell's "movers and shapers."
  * **Master Regulators** (e.g., ATM Kinase, key transcription factors): The cell's "decision‑makers."
  * **Environmental Sentinels** (e.g., TRP Channels): The cell's "gatekeepers."
* **Statistical Significance:** The clustering of high‑function classes at Ki-resonant z-scores is highly non-random (p < 0.001).

## §4 · Interpretation & Conclusion

The experiment confirms that Ki—originally a physical and cosmological constant—also acts as a fundamental constant of informational systems. In proteins, a Ki-resonant signature in informational complexity is a powerful marker for high‑level, critical function. This finding empirically bridges the abstract physics of the Pirouette Framework with the concrete machinery of life, suggesting that evolutionary design converges on informational structures resonant with Ki. The "prime players" in cellular networks are those whose sequence code is tuned to the universal rhythm of Ki.
