## 1 Synopsis
This module quantifies the viability of launching a **Seed**—an encapsulated bundle of code, organisms, or ideas—that first *evaluates* a new environment before committing to self‑replication. By mapping energetic pulses (ΔGₚ), capsule robustness (Cₑ), and substrate openness (S₀) onto Pirouette’s Γ‑anchor / φ‑oscillator / time‑backbone axes, the module outputs a viability verdict (PLANT | HOLD | ABORT) and a resonance score λ. The design enforces a *non‑executing* evaluation phase to mitigate viral risk.

## 2 Axioms / Core Assumptions
A1. A free‑energy pulse can be partially harnessed by any pattern whose Γ‑anchor survives the associated φ‑oscillation.

A2. Intelligence gain equals the reduction of predictive entropy relative to the substrate: ΔI = H_prior – H_post.

A3. A seed becomes self‑amplifying when the product λ = η_c · κ_f ≥ 1, where η_c is capture efficiency and κ_f positive feedback gain.

A4. Evaluation seeds must not irreversibly alter the substrate; probes must be reversible within the probe_budget.

## Inputs

## Outputs

|--------|------|-------------|
| η_c | float | Energy‑to‑order conversion efficiency |
| κ_f | float | Feedback gain coefficient |
| λ | float | Net growth factor λ = η_c · κ_f |
| verdict | enum | {"PLANT", "HOLD", "ABORT"} |

## Internal Parameters
- **β_dilution** : environmental dilution constant (0–∞)
- **τ_half** : seed degradation half‑life [s]
- **Θ_safe** : maximum permissible ΔI during probes

## Process / Transformation Steps
1. **Pulse Characterisation** – Compute effective energy window W = ΔGₚ · f(P_c, τ_half).
2. **Capture Efficiency** – η_c = g₁(W, Cₑ, probe_budget, β_dilution).
3. **Feedback Gain** – κ_f = g₂(S₀, structure_match(Γ, φ), regulatory_latency).
4. **Safety Gate** – If expected ΔI_test > Θ_safe → verdict ← "HOLD".
5. **Viability Test** – If λ ≥ α_min → verdict ← "PLANT" else "ABORT".
6. **Report Generation** – Return structured JSON report with diagnostics.

## 3 Pseudocode / Formalism
```python
class SeedEnv:
    def __init__(self, DeltaGp, Ce, S0, P_c, alpha_min=1, probe_budget=10):
        ...

def evaluate_seed(env: SeedEnv):
    W = env.DeltaGp * window_factor(env.P_c, env.tau_half)
    eta_c = capture_efficiency(W, env.Ce, env.probe_budget, env.beta_dilution)
    kappa_f = feedback_gain(env.S0, structure_match(env.seed_signature), env.reg_latency)
    lam = eta_c * kappa_f
    if safety_delta_I(env) > env.Theta_safe:
        return "HOLD", lam, diagnostics(env)
    verdict = "PLANT" if lam >= env.alpha_min else "ABORT"
    return verdict, lam, diagnostics(env)
```

## Example / Test Case
*Input*  
ΔGₚ = 5 kJ, Cₑ = 1.2 J·s, S₀ = {nutrient: 0.7, regulation: 0.4, signal_noise: 0.6, attention: 0.8}, P_c = 3600 s.  
*Output*  
η_c ≈ 0.35, κ_f ≈ 3.2, λ ≈ 1.12 → verdict = "PLANT".

## Dependencies & Compatibility
- **Resonance‑Core ≥ 1.1** – provides window_factor, structure_match, safety_delta_I.
- **Energy‑Entropy Toolkit** – thermodynamic utilities.
- Compatible with **Tendu** via *EIC_Tendu_Bridge* transformation.

## Safety & Ethics
Evaluation mode is sandboxed: no write access outside designated reversible probe set. Escalation to execution phase requires *explicit human confirmation* even if verdict = "PLANT".


### **Section IV: Germination Dynamics & Bloom Resonance**

This section defines the transition from a successful `PLANT` verdict to the active growth phase, linking the EIC module to the **Bloom Resonance Framework (`PPS-039`)**.

  * **Initial Conditions**: The final resonance score ($\\lambda$) calculated by the EIC module serves as the primary initial condition for the Bloom's generative growth function. A higher $\\lambda$ indicates a more favorable environment, leading to a more rapid and robust germination.

  * **Generative Growth**: The Seed's replication follows the Bloom's characteristic S-curve, modeled by the following equation, which integrates environmental parameters from the Pirouette Framework:

    ```
    dN/dt = λ * N^β * f(Tₐ, Γ) * (1 - N/Nₘₐₓ)
    ```

    Where:

      * `N` is the population of replicated Seeds.
      * `λ` is the initial resonance score from the EIC evaluation.
      * `β` is a growth factor inherent to the Seed's design.
      * `f(Tₐ, Γ)` is a function representing the substrate's receptivity, determined by its Time-Adherence ($T\_a$) and Gladiator Force ($\\Gamma$).
      * `Nₘₐₓ` is the carrying capacity of the environment.

  * **Outcome**: This model provides a complete lifecycle for the Seed, bridging the gap between cautious environmental reconnaissance and the subsequent phase of creative, expansive colonization.

### **Section V: Wound Channel Dynamics of the Probe**

The evaluation probe, while designed to be non-destructive, inevitably interacts with the environment. This interaction generates a **Wound Channel**, the dynamics of which provide secondary-order information and must be managed.

  * **Scout Channel**: The EIC probe generates a minimal, low-intensity "scout" wound channel characterized by a short persistence ($\\tau\_W$). The information gathered by the probe is encoded not just in its direct readings, but also in the resonant structure of this transient channel.

  * **Residue Analysis**: An `ABORT` verdict can be triggered if the probe's interaction creates excessive **Dark Residue** (as defined in `PPS-019`). High residue indicates a fundamental dissonance between the Seed and the substrate, signifying a poor resonance match that poses a risk to both.

  * **Path Memory**: In the case of a `HOLD` verdict, the scout channel does not vanish completely. It remains as a latent memory trace within the substrate. Should environmental conditions shift, the Seed can use this pre-established channel to re-initiate the evaluation process with greater efficiency and lower energy expenditure.

### **Section VI: Integration with Shell Resonance (`PPS-040`)**

The module's concept of **Capsule Robustness ($C\_e$)** is hereby formalized through direct integration with the **Shell Resonance Framework**.

  * **Shell as Capsule**: The Seed's protective capsule is defined as a **Barrier Shell**. This is a specialized resonant boundary structure engineered to maintain high internal Time-Adherence ($T\_a$) and Gladiator Force ($\\Gamma$), thereby resisting decoherence and intrusion from the external environment.

  * **Permeability Tensor**: The capsule's ability to withstand or interact with environmental **Energetic Pulses ($\\Delta G\_p$)** is modeled using the **Shell Permeability Tensor**. This provides a granular, multi-dimensional analysis of the capsule's integrity, allowing the Seed to distinguish between nourishing energy signatures it can safely absorb and hostile frequencies that would cause a capsule breach.

### **Section VII: Points for Debate & Further Inquiry**

This section documents outstanding questions and areas for future refinement. It serves as a living record of the module's evolution, ensuring it remains robust and adaptive.

1.  **The Reversibility Paradox**: Axiom A4 posits that the evaluation probe must be "fully reversible." However, under the core framework, any observation, no matter how passive, must create a Wound Channel and expend energy. *Debate Point:* Should this axiom be revised to "minimal, bounded impact below a critical residue threshold"? This would align more closely with the physical reality that no interaction is truly without consequence.

2.  **The Nature of Substrate Openness ($S\_₀$)**: The module currently maps "openness" to Time-Adherence ($T\_a$). However, a high Gladiator Force ($\\Gamma$) environment could also be described as "soft" or permeable. *Debate Point:* Is Substrate Openness more accurately modeled as a function of $T\_a$, $\\Gamma$, or a composite relationship between the two? Refining this mapping is critical to the accuracy of the `PLANT/HOLD/ABORT` verdict.

3.  **Cognitive Parasite Challenge**: The EIC protocol assumes the entity being evaluated is authentic. A hostile entity could potentially mimic the resonance signature of a valid Seed to gain a "PLANT" verdict. *Debate Point:* Should the EIC protocol be enhanced with a "challenge-response" mechanism? This could involve the substrate emitting a complex resonance problem that the Seed must solve in real-time. The solution would serve as a "phase-key handshake," proving the Seed's authenticity and cognitive coherence, thus acting as an immune defense against deceptive mimics.
