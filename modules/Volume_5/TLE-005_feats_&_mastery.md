## §1 · Preamble: The Shape of Mastery
As an entity's power grows, their will begins to crystalize into specific, repeatable expressions of mastery. These are Feats: unique abilities and passive enhancements that represent a deep, focused investment of entropy. This module provides the framework for this arc of progression, allowing characters to purchase bundled features that define their unique style of interacting with the world.

## §2 · Acquiring Feats
Feats are not granted at specific levels; they are purchased. An entity can choose to permanently invest a portion of their Total Entropy Pool (TEP) to acquire a new Feat. This represents a conscious decision to specialize in a particular area of expertise. The EP cost of each Feat is fixed.

## §3 · The Feat Menu
The following is a list of common Feats available for purchase. GMs are encouraged to create their own to suit their campaign and reward players for unique accomplishments.

## Movement Feats
- Entropic Stride

Cost: 10 EP

Effect: When you spend EP on a specialized movement action (running, flying, burrowing), you may roll 1d2 for each EP spent. You take the higher of the two results as the amount of EP applied to the movement. (e.g., spend 5 EP, roll 5d2, results are 1,2,1,2,2 - you apply 8 EP worth of movement, gaining 20 feet instead of 12.5).

- Kinetic Transfer

Cost: 8 EP

Effect: When you successfully push an opponent into a solid surface (like a wall), you may add the EP cost of your movement this turn to the damage of the attack.

- Impact Absorption

Cost: 6 EP

Prerequisite: Must possess a form of flight.

Effect: When flying, you may intentionally strike the ground. You negate all fall damage from a height up to three times your base movement speed.

- Earth Glide

Cost: 8 EP

Prerequisite: Must possess a form of burrowing.

Effect: You can burrow through solid stone at half your normal burrowing speed.

## Combat & Arcane Feats
- Reckless Strike

Cost: 10 EP

Effect: Before you make an attack roll, you can choose to take a -4 penalty to the accuracy check. If the attack hits, you may add 8 to the entropic force of the attack before the target makes their defensive roll.

- Far Caster's Gambit

Cost: 8 EP

Effect: When using the Spell Sniper's Gambit (TLE-003) to increase a spell's range, you may roll 1d2 for each EP spent on the variable portion of the range. You take the higher of the two results, multiply it by 5 feet, and add it to the spell's total range.

- Mender's Respite

Cost: 12 EP

Effect: When using healing magic on yourself, you may restore a number of Hit Points up to your Wisdom modifier each round without spending any Entropy Points.

## Entropic Fusion Feats
These feats allow a character to combine and synergize their various pools of invested Entropy.

- Feat: Entropic Font

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You have learned to treat your will as a single, unified source. You can treat all of your Arcane Skill entropy pools as a single, combined resource for the purposes of casting spells or using abilities. You must still express that through one skill at a time unless otherwise feated or stated by an item or ability.

- Feat: Arcane Synthesis

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: At least two Arcane Skill pools.

Effect: Choose two of your Arcane Skill pools (e.g., "Expression of Frost" and "Pyromancy"). You have learned to weave their energies together. You can now spend EP from either pool to create a combined "synthesis" effect. A "Frostfire" bolt, for example, might deal cold damage while also inflicting a burning status effect. The exact nature of the synthesis is determined by you and the GM.

- Feat: Soul-Clad Weapon

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You have learned to channel your will through a chosen weapon. You may now spend EP from an Arcane Skill pool to add an equal amount of bonus damage of that skill's type to your next weapon attack.

## Kinetic Weaving Feats
These feats allow a character to imbue their physical actions, particularly movement, with entropic power.

- Feat: Elemental Wake

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: An Arcane Skill pool with an elemental descriptor (e.g., Frost, Fire, Lightning).

Effect: When you take the Move action, you can spend EP from a relevant elemental Arcane Skill pool. For every 2 EP spent, you leave a 5-foot square trail of that element in one of the squares you exit. This trail lasts for one round. An ice trail creates difficult terrain, a fire trail deals minor damage to anyone who enters it, etc.

- Feat: Shadow Step

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: A "Subterfuge" Skill pool.

Effect: When you are in dim light or darkness, you can spend EP from your Subterfuge pool as a bonus action to teleport to another unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. The distance you can teleport is 5 feet for every 1 EP spent.

- Feat: Juggernaut's Momentum

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: When you take the Move action and move at least 15 feet in a straight line towards an enemy, you can spend Size Entropy from your Legs to add an equal amount of bonus damage to your first melee attack against that enemy before the end of your turn.

## Form & Essence Feats
These are advanced, high-cost feats that allow a character to manipulate the very fabric of being.

- Feat: Flesh Sculptor

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You have learned the rudimentary principles of shaping the entropic form. You gain the "Flesh Sculpting" Arcane Skill. You can spend EP from this pool to make cosmetic changes to a willing creature or yourself (changing hair color, eye color, minor features). More advanced uses, such as creating temporary gills or claws, require a high EP cost and a difficult Intelligence check. This is a profound and often unsettling art.

- Feat: Entropic Siphon

Cost: 20 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: CON Score of 15 or higher.

Effect: You have attuned yourself to the chaotic flow of Entropy in the world, but this connection is dangerous. Once per long rest, as an action, you can attempt to draw raw Entropy from your environment. Make a CON check against a Target Number of 20.

Success: You regain EP equal to your CON modifier.

Failure: You take psychic damage equal to your CON modifier and create a random "Spasm" or "Fracture" in your current location as the chaotic energy lashes out.

## Entropic Conversion Feats
These feats allow a character to transform one resource into another. This conversion is always inefficient—the "tax" for breaking the natural flow of Entropy—making it a strategic choice rather than a standard action.

- Feat: Kinetic Conversion

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: As a bonus action on your turn, you can sacrifice your potential for movement to fuel your will. You can reduce your movement speed for the turn in 10-foot increments. For every 10 feet of movement sacrificed, you regain 1 EP to a skill or attribute pool of your choice.

- Feat: Arcane Velocity

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: At least one Arcane Skill pool.

Effect: As a bonus action on your turn, you can burn your magical reserves to fuel a burst of speed. You can spend EP from any Arcane Skill pool. For every 2 EP spent, you increase your movement speed by 10 feet for the current turn.

- Feat: Vital Sacrifice

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: As an action, you can harm your own physical form to fuel your power. You can choose to take irreducible damage to your HP. For every 2 points of damage you take, you may allocate 1 EP to any skill or attribute pool.

- Feat: Will to Power

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: As a bonus action, you can convert your raw will into temporary physical might. You can spend EP from any attribute pool (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS). For every 2 EP spent, you can add 1 EP to the Size Entropy of one of your limbs. This bonus Size Entropy lasts until the end of your next turn.

## Combat & Targeting Feats
These feats alter the fundamental minigames of combat, allowing for advanced offensive and defensive maneuvers.

- Feat: Reactive Evasion

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You have the "final word" in your own defense. When an enemy makes an attack roll against you, after they roll but before the outcome is determined, you can use your reaction to spend EP from your Dexterity attribute pool. For every 3 EP you spend, you may subtract 1 from the enemy's attack roll.

- Feat: Precision Strike

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: Your accuracy can be converted into raw power. When you make an attack roll and the result is higher than the Target Number (TN), you can choose to add the difference to the attack's damage as bonus EP. This bonus cannot exceed +5 EP.

## Perception & Environment Feats
These feats govern how a character perceives and interacts with the world around them, particularly with varying levels of light.

- Feat: Gloom-Sight

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: Your senses are adapted to the dark. You can perceive two tiers of light lower than normal. For you, "Dim Light" is perceived as "Normal Light," and "Vague Shapes" are perceived as "Dim Light." You cannot perceive anything in "Total Darkness."

- Feat: Resonant Senses

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: WIS Score of 10 or higher.

Effect: You have developed a form of blindsight by sensing the entropic resonance of objects and beings. You can automatically perceive the location of any creature or object with an Entropy Pool within 30 feet, regardless of light levels or physical obstructions. This does not allow you to see fine details, only their shape and location.

- Feat: Umbral Affinity

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You draw power from the shadows. At the start of your turn, if you are in Dim Light or Darkness, you regain 2 EP to a pool of your choice.

- Feat: Solar Attunement

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You are energized by the sun's power. At the start of your turn, if you are in Full Light or Bright Light, you regain 2 EP to a pool of your choice.

## Disciplines
These feats represent dedicated practice and mastery over a specific, non-innate discipline, from a craftsman's trade to a cleric's rites.

- Feat: Professional Aptitude

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: Choose a specific non-combat profession (e.g., Blacksmithing, Alchemy, Cartography). You have dedicated yourself to its mastery. You gain a "Professional" skill pool with 5 EP invested in it. You can spend EP from this pool to gain advantage on checks related to this profession or to recall crucial information about it.

- Feat: Silver Tongue

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: Choose a specific area of performance or social grace (e.g., a musical instrument, a specific card game, a language, etiquette). You have mastered it. You gain a "Performance" skill pool with 5 EP invested in it. You can spend EP from this pool to influence others, create a masterful work of art, or cheat at a game of cards.

- Feat: Ritualist

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: WIS Score of 5 or higher.

Effect: You have been trained in the art of ritual magic or prayer. You gain the "Ritual" Arcane Skill. You can spend EP from this pool to perform long, complex magical effects outside of combat, such as blessing or corrupting a location, consecrating ground, or scrying on a distant target. The cost and time required are determined by the GM.

- Feat: Cleric Training

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: Must possess a holy symbol or divine focus.

Effect: Through devotion and training, you can channel a small measure of divine power. Your holy symbol gains a dedicated pool of 3 EP. As an action, you can spend this EP to heal a creature you touch, restoring HP on a 1-for-1 basis. This pool recharges all 3 EP after two full rounds of not being used.

## Social & Conversational Feats
This suite of feats makes social encounters as tactical and engaging as physical combat, allowing for a variety of approaches to conversation.

- Feat: Orator's Gambit

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You can apply the principles of entropic investment to social contests. When you attempt to persuade, deceive, or intimidate a target, you may declare you are using this feat. You secretly invest a chosen amount of EP from your Wisdom or Intelligence pool. The target then makes a contested Wisdom check. If their roll is lower than your invested EP, you succeed. This allows for high-stakes social maneuvering.

- Feat: Arcane Influence

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: At least one Arcane Skill pool.

Effect: You can subtly weave your magic into your words and presence. You may spend EP from an Arcane Skill pool instead of an attribute pool when using the Orator's Gambit feat. This may manifest as a charming illusion, a subtle telepathic nudge, or a faint aura of fear, depending on the nature of your magic.

- Feat: Empathic Reader

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: WIS Score of 8 or higher.

Effect: As an action, you can focus on a creature you can see and make a contested Wisdom check against them. On a success, you gain a brief, intuitive insight into their current emotional state and surface-level intentions (e.g., "they are angry and looking for a fight," or "they are hiding something").

- Feat: Disarming Presence

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: Your natural demeanor is unassuming and non-threatening. When you first meet an NPC, their initial disposition towards you is improved by one step (e.g., from "Hostile" to "Unfriendly," or "Neutral" to "Friendly"), unless you have taken overtly hostile actions.

- Feat: Intimidating Visage

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: Your physical presence is inherently menacing. You can choose to use your Strength or Constitution modifier instead of your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier when making checks to intimidate.

- Feat: Primal Manifestation

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You have learned to unravel and re-weave your own entropic form. As an action, you can transform into a beast or hybrid form you have designed using the creature creation rules. This transformation is governed by the following principles:

Form Investment: You must invest a certain amount of EP from your own TEP into the transformation. This is your Form Investment Pool (FIP). The FIP serves as the temporary Hit Points of your new form.

Form Potential: The maximum TEP of your new form, including its attributes and body parts, is equal to your FIP x 3.

Attribute Weaving: To create the powerful attributes of your new form, you may choose two of your own attributes to weave together. One becomes the Dominant Attribute, and the other the Supporting Attribute. The new form's combined attribute is calculated as: New Attribute EP = Dominant Attribute EP + floor(Supporting Attribute EP / 2).

Ending the Transformation: The transformation ends if your form's temporary HP (its FIP) is reduced to 0, if you choose to end it as a bonus action, or if the form's own TEP is somehow drained to 0. When you revert, you return to your previous HP total.

## Advanced Transformation Feats
These feats build upon the principles of Primal Manifestation, offering unique and specialized paths for those who wish to re-weave their own form.

- Feat: Feral Curse

Cost: This feat cannot be purchased. It is acquired as a curse or a dangerous pact.

Effect: Your form is unstable, bound to a powerful, primal entity. As an action, you can undergo a monstrous transformation. This transformation is governed by the following principles:

The Bargain: Choose two of your attributes. One is the Exalted Attribute, the other is the Sacrificed Attribute. For the duration of the transformation, the EP value of your Sacrificed Attribute becomes negative and is added to your Exalted Attribute. (Example: A character with STR 10 and INT 10 could sacrifice their INT, making it -10 EP, and add that to their STR, making it 20 EP).

The Beast Within: The transformed state has its own will. At the start of each of your turns, you must make a contested Wisdom check against the form's own will (the GM sets the TN, often based on the Pact's Hold or the curse's power). On a failure, the GM controls your actions for that turn as the beast acts on its own instincts.

Ending the Transformation: The transformation lasts for one hour, until you are knocked unconscious, or until the entity's goals are met.

- Feat: Thousand Forms Adept

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You are a master of minor transformations. You may design up to five different beast forms, none of which can have a total Entropy Budget greater than 20 EP.

Rapid Change: You can transform into one of your chosen forms as a bonus action. This transformation does not grant temporary HP or use the attribute weaving rules. You simply adopt the physical form and statistics of the creature, using its TEP and attributes instead of your own. Your own TEP and attributes are suppressed for the duration.

- Feat: Skin Dancer

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You are a master of mimicry. You gain the "Mimicry" Arcane Skill.

The Mask: After observing a humanoid creature for at least one minute, you can spend an action to transform into a perfect physical replica of them. This is a non-magical, physical change.

The Performance: You can spend EP from your "Mimicry" pool to perfect the illusion. Investing EP allows you to replicate the target's voice, mannerisms, and surface thoughts, with the GM setting an EP cost for the level of detail you wish to achieve. This feat does not grant you the target's memories, skills, or entropic abilities.

## Archetypal Feats
These feats grant access to the iconic abilities of classic archetypes, allowing any character to walk the path of a Barbarian, Monk, Sorcerer, or Necromancer.

## The Path of Rage
- Feat: Primal Rage

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: As a bonus action, you can enter a rage. While raging, you gain a temporary pool of "Rage EP" at the start of each of your turns equal to the sum of all your attribute modifiers (except Wisdom). This EP can be spent on any action but vanishes at the end of your turn. The rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to your ERR. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious, or if you end your turn without having attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since your last turn.

- Feat: Stalwart Defense

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: As a reaction when you take damage, you can enter a defensive stance until the start of your next turn. For every 5 points of incoming damage, you may spend 1 EP from your Constitution pool to roll a d2; on a result of 2, you ignore that 5 points of damage.

## The Path of Focus
- Feat: Patient Defense

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: At the start of your turn, you can declare you are using this feat. You may set aside a number of EP up to the sum of your DEX and WIS modifiers from their respective pools. The first time you are hit with an attack before your next turn, this set-aside EP is doubled and subtracted from the attack's damage.

- Feat: Superior Strike

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: A number of times per long rest equal to your CON modifier, you may add your DEX modifier as bonus EP to an unarmed strike's damage.

- Feat: Dim Mak

Cost: 20 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: WIS Score of 15 or higher.

Effect: When you successfully damage an opponent with an unarmed strike, you can use this ancient and forbidden technique. Make an attack roll with a TN of 20. On a success, you mark the target with a touch of death. At the start of each of their turns, the target must roll 1d100. If the result is a number you secretly chose when you applied the mark, the target dies instantly. This is a profound and often evil act with significant narrative consequences.

## The Path of Sorcery

- Feat: Metamagic Adept

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You have learned to break the fundamental rules of spellcasting. You gain access to the following abilities:

Empower Spell: When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend an additional 2 EP to empower it. If you do, the target's ERR is reduced by the damage dealt for one round.

Quicken Spell: You can spend an additional 5 EP to change a spell's casting time from 1 action to 1 bonus action.

Twin Spell: When you cast a spell, you can spend an additional 10 EP to make that spell's point of impact the origin point for a second, identical spell cast on the same turn.

## The Path of Necromancy
- Feat: Primary Thrall

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You have learned the dark art of direct entropic infusion. You can target a corpse and begin to pour your own TEP into it. You must invest EP into its negative attributes to make them positive. This undead creature is sustained only by your will; at the start of each of your turns, you must spend at least 1 EP from your own TEP to maintain its animation. It does not impose an ERR cost, but it collapses into dust if you fail to sustain it.

- Feat: Ritual of Animation

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You can perform a 10-minute ritual to animate a corpse as a lesser undead thrall. You must then immediately engage it in a Tamer's Conversation to assert your will. If successful, you can form a Soul Bond with it, paying its full Entropy Budget from your TEP and the subsequent ERR cost to maintain it as a permanent minion.

## Kinetic & Synergistic Feats
This school of abilities focuses on the manipulation of kinetic force and the interaction of different entropic energies.

- Feat: Kinetic Weaving

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You gain the "Kinesis" Arcane Skill and a pool of 5 EP. This skill is the foundation for manipulating physical force.

- Feat: Telekinetic Shove (Push)

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: "Kinesis" Arcane Skill.

Effect: As an action, you can spend EP from your Kinesis pool to unleash a wave of telekinetic force. Target a creature or object within 30 feet. The target must make a contested Strength check against your EP investment. If they fail, you can push them 5 feet for every 1 EP you spent.

- Feat: Entropic Grasp (Pull)

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: "Kinesis" Arcane Skill.

Effect: As an action, you can spend EP from your Kinesis pool to create a tether of force. Target a creature or object within 30 feet. The target must make a contested Strength check against your EP investment. If they fail, you can pull them 5 feet closer to you for every 1 EP you spent.

- Feat: Synergistic Casting

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: At least two elemental Arcane Skills (e.g., Fire, Ice, Water, Earth).

Effect: You have mastered the art of elemental interaction. When two different, interacting elemental effects created by you or your allies occupy the same space or target the same creature in the same round, you can use your reaction to spend 3 EP and create a tertiary synergistic effect.

Examples: Fire + Water = Obscuring Steam Cloud; Earth + Wind = Blinding Dust Devil; Fire + Ice = Shattering Thermal Shock (makes target vulnerable to physical damage for one round).

## Spell Modification Feats
This suite of feats allows a caster to alter the fundamental properties of their spells, adding layers of tactical depth and surprise.

Feat: Veiled Casting

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You can weave illusions into your magic to conceal its true nature. When you cast a spell, you can spend additional EP to make it invisible. For every 1 EP you spend on the spell's core effect (damage, range, etc.), you must spend an additional 1 EP to make that component invisible. To disguise secondary sensory effects (heat, cold, sound), you must spend another 1 EP.

- Feat: Concussive Force

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend an additional 3 EP to add a kinetic rider. The target is pushed 5 feet directly away from the spell's point of origin.

- Feat: Ricochet Cast

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: When you cast a spell that creates a projectile, you can spend an additional 1 EP to have it bounce off one surface, changing its trajectory up to 90 degrees. This can be done multiple times, but isn't a perfect shot, meaning it reflects uncontrollably after one ricochet. This can be fun for filling rooms with spell chaos.

- Feat: Spell Animator

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You gain the "Spell Animation" Arcane Skill. When you cast a spell, you can spend additional EP from this skill pool to give the spell a rudimentary, temporary consciousness.

Burrow (1 EP per 5 feet): The spell can travel through solid, non-magical material of up to 1-foot thickness.

Animate (1 EP per EP of the core spell): The spell manifests as a tiny, mobile construct (a fiery imp, an icy serpent). It can move on its own turn and intelligently seek its target, navigating around obstacles. It still requires an attack roll to hit when it reaches its target.
