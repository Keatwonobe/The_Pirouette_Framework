## §1 · Preamble: The Rule-Bending Object
In the world of The Lost Eternal, an item is more than a tool; it is a vessel for a unique idea, a physical container for a fragment of will. The most powerful artifacts are not those with the highest raw power, but those that possess their own unique "minigame"—a special subsystem that allows its wielder to interact with the world in a way no one else can. This module provides the framework for these interactive items, turning the act of gearing a character into a collection of unique, build-defining toys.

## §2 · The Soul of the Item: The Enchantment Principle
Every unique item begins with a simple principle: Entropy can be invested to create a rule. By permanently sacrificing TEP into an object, a creator can give it a soul—a pool of its own Entropy and a unique instruction on how to use it. This is the foundation of all minigames.

Example: The Returning Dagger (10 EP Investment):

A creator sacrifices 10 TEP into a dagger. This creates a 10 EP "Return" pool within the item. The wielder can spend 10 EP from this pool to have the dagger instantly return to their hand after being thrown. The pool regenerates half it's TEP per round when used for movement.

Example: The Swift Blade (10 EP Investment):

10 TEP is sacrificed into a sword to grant it "Lightness." This creates a 10 EP pool that the wielder can spend from to reduce the EP cost of their own attacks made with the blade, effectively granting them "free" swings.

## §3 · Minigame Type: Weapon Containment
Warriors and mages channel entropy differently. A mage's body is the conduit, risking an Entropic Overload on a miss. A warrior uses a weapon as a dedicated, safer conduit.

The Minigame: A weapon has its own TEP, representing its structural integrity. When attacking with the weapon, the wielder does not use the Universal Accuracy Check. Instead, they make a simple Weapon Attack Roll (d20 + relevant attribute modifier) against the target's Active Defense or a base DC.

The Risk & Reward: A warrior can safely channel EP into their weapon up to its TEP limit. However, they can choose to Overload the Weapon, pushing more EP into the strike than the weapon can contain.

The Check: When a weapon is Overloaded, it must make a Constitution "saving throw" (a d20 roll, using its own CON score, which is derived from its TEP). The DC is 10 + the amount of EP overloaded.

Success: The attack goes off with devastating force, and the weapon holds.

Failure: The attack still hits, but the weapon shatters into mundane fragments, its magic and TEP lost forever.

## §4 · Minigame Type: Arcane Conduits & Wards
Magic-users have a host of items designed to augment their dangerous art.

### 4.1 · Wands & Staves (The Glass Cannon)
A wand is an external battery for a mage. As per the enchanting rules, it has its own TEP, attributes, and a high ERR, allowing it to regenerate EP far faster than a character. This makes it an intensely powerful tool for burst damage.

The Minigame: The wand is a separate entity. The caster can draw EP from the wand's pool instead of their own to cast spells. However, the wand is a fragile object with its own (usually very low) Health Pool. Any attack that targets the wand can easily destroy it, making its wielder's source of power a vulnerable and tempting target for enemies.

### 4.2 · Wards (The Recharging Buffer)
A ward is a small, semi-sentient magical field that offers a buffer against incoming attacks.

The Minigame: A ward is an item that grants its wearer a Temporary HP Pool.

Capacity: This pool is typically very small (e.g., 4-8 EP).

Recharge: The ward has its own passive Recharge Rate (e.g., 1 EP per round). This recharge only begins on the round after the ward has taken damage.

The Dynamic: This creates a unique defensive rhythm. A warded character can absorb a small hit for free, but a sustained barrage will break through the ward and attack their true defenses. It rewards tactical positioning and gives characters a chance to mitigate chip damage from things like archer fire or environmental hazards.

## §5 · Assemblé
To find a new item is to find a new way to see the world. A sword is not just a sharp piece of metal; it is a choice between a measured strike and a final, shattering blow. A ward is not just armor; it is a breath, a rhythm of defense and recovery. In this world, the greatest heroes are not just those with the most power, but those who have collected the most interesting toys, and have mastered the unique, wonderful, and dangerous games that each one plays.
