## §1 · Purpose
A Tendu diagnostic tool that scans critical systems for resonance anomalies by inverting known constant patterns and detecting misalignments. Designed to identify pre-collapse signatures, decoherence threats, or high-friction lock formations in any structured domain.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Stable systems exhibit predictable resonance patterns and phase relationships governed by Pirouette constants. Instead of searching for these patterns directly in a noisy field (as TEN-URLA does), Resonance Fault Detection assumes a nominal, healthy state, computationally inverts this expected pattern to create a 'null template,' and then subtracts the observed field. In a perfectly healthy system, the result is near zero. Significant non-zero residues ('fault loci') immediately highlight deviations, decoherence, or stress, indicating potential system faults long before they cascade into catastrophic failure. It is a search for 'anti-resonance' or dissonance against an ideal background.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: The nominal state is defined by a high, stable $T_a$. Faults are often detected as localized zones of suppressed or fluctuating $T_a$ that deviate from the expected coherence. The magnitude of $T_a$ degradation is a key fault metric.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: The nominal state has a characteristic $\Gamma$ profile. Faults can manifest as regions of anomalously high $\Gamma$ (decoherence, boundary loss) or low $\Gamma$ (incipient lock formations, rigidity). The fault's 'resonance impedance' can be related to its local $\Gamma$ signature.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: The nominal state is expected to exhibit $K_i$-harmonic coherence. Faults can be detected as a loss of this harmonic structure or a drift in the system's dominant $K_i$ mode (e.g., from rest to motion), which the inverted template would flag as a misalignment.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: The core of the analysis involves detecting persistent, non-zero phase differences ($\Delta\phi$) between the actual system state and the inverted nominal state. These phase misalignments are the primary indicators of a resonance fault.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Data representing a multiscale resonance field, containing spatial or temporal distributions of key Pirouette parameters ($T_a(x,t), \Gamma(x,t)$) and phase information ($K_i\phi(x,t)$ or equivalent). The system must have a definable 'nominal' or 'healthy' state.
* **And Structure**: Gridded field data (2D, 3D, or higher), multivariate time-series, or network data where nodes/edges have associated Pirouette parameters. Often an output from a monitoring module or a system simulation.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient data resolution to capture the scale of potential faults. A clear definition or baseline measurement of the system's nominal/healthy resonance pattern is required to generate the inverse template.
* **Steps**: Normalization of input fields. Application of a smoothing kernel to reduce transient spikes and avoid false positives is recommended. Segmentation of data into relevant domains for localized fault detection.

### 3·2 · Operational Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `NominalStateDefinition` | A model or dataset representing the system's healthy, nominal resonance field ($R_{actual}$). This is the baseline from which the inverse template is generated. | `A reference field map, or a set of constants and functions defining the expected state.` |
| `InverseMappingFunction` | The transformation used to generate the inverse-expected field ($R_{expected\_inverse}$) from the nominal state. This could be a phase inversion, amplitude inversion, or more complex operator. | `Function handle, e.g., $f(x) = -x$ or $f(x) = 1/x$ depending on the field type.` |
| `FaultThreshold_delta (δ)` | The minimum magnitude of misalignment ($∆R$) to be classified as a fault locus. | `System-dependent, often defined relative to the variance of the nominal field.` |
| `FaultClassificationLogic` | A set of rules for classifying identified fault loci based on their characteristics (shape, depth, impedance) into types like 'Decoherence Threat', 'Pre-Fracture Stress', 'Incipient Lock'. | `Rule-based classifier.` |

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. 1. Define Nominal State: Load or define the nominal resonance field of the system, $R_{actual}(T_a, \Gamma, K_i, \phi)$.
2. 2. Generate Inverse Template: Apply the `InverseMappingFunction` to the nominal state to create the inverse-expected resonance gradient, $R_{expected\_inverse}$.
3. 3. Calculate Misalignment Field: Subtract the observed field from the inverse template to get the misalignment field: $∆R = R_{expected\_inverse} - R_{actual}$. In practice, this often means comparing the observed field to the *expected* field and looking for deviations: $∆R = |R_{expected} - R_{actual}|$.
4. 4. Identify Fault Loci: Scan the misalignment field $∆R$ and identify all contiguous regions where the magnitude exceeds the `FaultThreshold_delta` (δ). These are the fault loci.
5. 5. Classify Fault Zones: For each fault locus, analyze its properties (size, shape, depth/magnitude of $∆R$, local derivatives) and apply the `FaultClassificationLogic` to classify its type (e.g., pre-fracture, decoherence zone, lock formation) and predict its stability or Ki drift.
6. 6. Output Map Generation: Compile the list of classified fault loci, their coordinates, misalignment magnitudes, and other derived characteristics into the final Fault Signature Map.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: A 'Fault Signature Map' containing a list of identified fault loci, each with: [Fault Coordinates (x,y,z,t), Magnitude of Misalignment (∆R), Classified Fault Type (e.g., 'Predicted Fracture Type'), Stability Forecast (e.g., based on Ki drift or $T_a$ decay rate)].
* **Insights And Derivations**: Early detection of systemic faults, decoherence threats, or high-friction lock formations. Identification of pre-collapse signatures not visible in direct observation. A quantifiable map of systemic stress or misalignment. Prioritized list of vulnerabilities for intervention.
* **Guidelines**: The location of fault loci indicates where the system deviates from healthy resonance. The magnitude of misalignment ($∆R$) indicates the severity of the fault. The fault classification suggests the nature of the risk (e.g., a 'pre-fracture' fault might be addressed differently than a 'decoherence' fault). The stability forecast helps prioritize which faults require most urgent attention.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Inverse Template Generation (Conceptual)
$$ R_{expected\_inverse} = \mathcal{T}^{-1}(R_{nominal}(T_a, \Gamma, K_i)) $$
Generation of an inverse-expected resonance field via a transformation operator $\mathcal{T}^{-1}$ applied to the nominal system state.

### Misalignment Field Calculation
$$ \u2206R(\vec{x}) = |R_{expected}(\vec{x}) - R_{actual}(\vec{x})| $$
Calculates the magnitude of the fault or deviation field by comparing the expected (nominal) resonance field with the actual observed field.

### Fault Locus Identification
$$ L_{fault} = \{\vec{x} | \u2206R(\vec{x}) > \delta_{threshold}\} $$
Identifies the set of coordinates (the fault locus) where the misalignment magnitude exceeds a defined threshold $\delta_{threshold}$.

### Resonance Impedance (Conceptual)
$$ Z_{res}(\vec{x}) \approx \frac{\u2206R(\vec{x})}{|\nabla(\u2206R(\vec{x}))|} $$
A conceptual metric for classifying a fault, relating its magnitude to the sharpness of its boundary. A high impedance suggests a sharp, localized fault; low impedance a diffuse one.
