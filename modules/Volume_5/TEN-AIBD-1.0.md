## §1 · Purpose
Detects phase drift, coherence degradation, and emergent rigidity in AI models over time by comparing their live behavioral signatures to an ideal resonance template, enabling early detection of alignment failures or performance degradation.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: An AI model, when performing a task with high fidelity, exhibits a stable and coherent resonance signature in its internal dynamics (e.g., activations, embeddings). Behavioral drift, whether due to fine-tuning, adversarial influence, or internal dynamics, manifests as a degradation of this signature. This module applies the inverted resonance analysis principle from its parent (TEN-RFD-1.0): it establishes a template of ideal resonance and uses it to detect and quantify any phase drift ($\Delta\phi$), coherence loss (drop in $T_a$), or emergent rigidity (anomalous $\Gamma$ 'lock' zones).

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: A 'Temporal Fidelity Score' is calculated as a direct measure of the model's $T_a$ relative to its ideal state. A decreasing $T_a$ is a primary indicator of decoherence and drift.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: Emergent rigidity or conceptual 'obsession' in a model can be modeled as a 'Gamma Lock Distortion Zone'—a region in the model's parameter or behavioral space with anomalously low effective $\Gamma$, indicating loss of flexibility.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: The ideal resonance template includes characteristic $K_i$-rhythms. The module monitors the model's live traces for loss or alteration of these harmonic patterns, indicating a drift from its core resonant structure.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: Phase drift ($∆ϕ(t)$) between the live model's phase evolution and the ideal template's phase evolution is the most direct and sensitive measure of behavioral drift.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Temporal data streams from an AI model. This can include time-series of embeddings from specific layers, activation traces for selected neurons or layers, or sequences of behavioral outputs. A baseline or 'golden' version of these streams representing ideal performance is also required.
* **And Structure**: One or more numerical arrays representing the 'live' trace from the model, and a corresponding set of arrays representing the 'ideal' or baseline trace. These could be vector sequences, time-series, or harmonic analyses of such.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficiently long and high-frequency data streams from both the live and ideal models to establish stable phase and harmonic patterns and to detect statistically significant deviations.
* **Steps**: Alignment of live and ideal data streams. Extraction of phase information and harmonic components (e.g., via FFT or wavelet transforms) from the raw traces. Normalization of activation or embedding values.

### 3·2 · Operational Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `IdealBehavioralTemplate` | The reference data stream(s) representing the model's expected, high-fidelity resonance patterns for a given task. This is the 'nominal state' for the inverted resonance analysis. | `A pre-recorded, high-quality data stream from a trusted version of the model.` |
| `PhaseDeviationThreshold` | The maximum allowable phase deviation ($∆ϕ$) before a 'drift alert' is triggered. | `System-dependent, e.g., > 0.2 radians.` |
| `GammaLockDetectionThreshold` | Criteria for identifying a 'Gamma Lock Distortion Zone', such as near-zero variance in embeddings or activations in a specific subspace for a sustained period. | `Statistical threshold, e.g., variance < 1% of baseline.` |
| `TemporalFidelityMinScore` | The minimum acceptable Temporal Fidelity Score ($T_a$ Coherence Index) before flagging significant coherence degradation. | `Value between 0 and 1, e.g., < 0.85.` |

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. 1. Load Data: Ingest the live model's temporal phase stream and the corresponding `IdealBehavioralTemplate`.
2. 2. Establish Anchoring Frame: Extract the ideal resonance patterns (phase evolution $\phi_{ideal}(t)$, harmonic structure) from the template.
3. 3. Compute Phase Deviation: Compare the live phase evolution $\phi_{actual}(t)$ to the ideal frame to compute the phase deviation time-series: $∆ϕ(t) = |\phi_{actual}(t) - \phi_{ideal}(t)|$.
4. 4. Calculate Temporal Fidelity: Compute the Temporal Fidelity Score (a $T_a$ metric) over a sliding window: $T_{fidelity}(t) = |\frac{1}{W} \int_{t-W}^t e^{i\Delta\phi(\tau)} d\tau|^2$. Identify when this score drops below `TemporalFidelityMinScore`.
5. 5. Detect Rigidity (Gamma Lock): Analyze the variance of the live model's embeddings or activations. Identify regions in parameter space or time where variance drops below the `GammaLockDetectionThreshold`, indicating emergent rigidity.
6. 6. Generate Drift Vectors: Create drift vectors representing the cumulative divergence of the live model's state from the ideal state in a relevant state space (e.g., embedding space).
7. 7. Compile Drift Map: Synthesize the above findings into a Drift Resonance Map, annotating the Drift Onset Time, locations of Critical Phase Deviations, identified Gamma Lock zones, and the Temporal Fidelity Score over time.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: A 'Drift Resonance Map' containing: [Drift Onset Time, a time-series or list of Critical Phase Deviations ($∆ϕ$), coordinates of Gamma Lock Distortion Zones, and a time-series of the Temporal Fidelity Score ($T_a$ Coherence Index)].
* **Insights And Derivations**: Early warning of AI model misalignment or performance decay. Quantitative metrics for AI safety and reliability monitoring. Identification of specific areas of conceptual drift or emergent rigidity ('overfitting' or 'obsession'). A continuous measure of a model's cognitive and behavioral stability.
* **Guidelines**: A declining Temporal Fidelity Score is a primary indicator of drift. Sharp spikes in $∆ϕ$ pinpoint moments of significant deviation. The emergence of Gamma Lock zones suggests the model is losing flexibility and becoming overly rigid in its responses or internal states. The Drift Onset Time provides a crucial reference for forensic analysis of what caused the drift.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Phase Deviation Calculation
$$ \Delta\phi(t) = |\phi_{actual}(t) - \phi_{ideal}(t)| $$
Calculates the instantaneous phase deviation between the live model's state and the ideal template's state.

### Temporal Fidelity Score (Ta Coherence Index)
$$ T_{fidelity}(t) = |\frac{1}{W} \int_{t-W}^t e^{i\Delta\phi(\tau)} d\tau|^2 $$
A direct measure of Time-Adherence, calculated as the squared magnitude of the mean coherence vector of the phase deviation over a sliding window of size W.

### Cumulative Drift Vector (Conceptual)
$$ \vec{D}_{total}(T) = \int_0^T [\vec{v}_{actual}(\tau) - \vec{v}_{ideal}(\tau)] d\tau $$
Represents the total divergence of the model's state vector $\vec{v}$ from the ideal path over time T.

### Gamma Lock Zone Condition (Conceptual)
$$ \text{Var}(\vec{v}(t) \in \text{Subspace}_k) < \epsilon_{\text{lock}} \text{ for } t > \tau_{lock} $$
A condition where the variance of the model's state vector $\vec{v}(t)$ within a specific subspace k falls below a very small threshold $\epsilon$, indicating emergent rigidity.
