## §1 · Preamble: The Same Clay
In the universe of The Lost Eternal, the Game Master is not a mere storyteller, but the primary architect of the resonant field in which the players exist. The world, its inhabitants, and its very dangers are sculpted from the same fundamental clay as the player characters: Entropy. This module provides the GM with the tools to be a fair and consistent architect, defining a universal system for challenge design. From the mightiest dragon to the subtlest negotiation, every obstacle is built from an Entropic Budget.

## §2 · The Universal Challenge: The Entropic Budget (EB)
Every challenge a player faces has a total entropic power level, its Entropic Budget. This is the GM's primary tool for scaling encounters and defining their difficulty.

Calculating the Budget: An encounter's EB is determined relative to the party's combined power. First, calculate the Party's Average TEP.
Party Average TEP = (Total TEP of all characters) / (Number of characters)

Encounter Difficulty:
| Difficulty | Entropic Budget (EB) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Trivial | 0.5 x Party Average TEP | A minor obstacle, easily overcome. |
| Normal | 1.0 x Party Average TEP | An equal footing. A 50/50 slog where strategy is key. |
| Hard | 1.25 x Party Average TEP | A significant challenge requiring teamwork and resource management. |
| Very Hard | 1.5 x Party Average TEP | A boss-level encounter that will likely drain the party significantly. |
| Legendary | 2.0+ x Party Average TEP | A world-altering threat that may require extensive preparation to survive. |

For a group of opponents, the GM can either give each creature a smaller portion of the total EB or create one powerful leader and several weaker minions.

## §3 · Designing Creatures: Combat Encounters
A creature is a simplified character sheet, built in moments using its Entropic Budget.

The Process:

Assign an Entropic Budget (EB) based on the desired difficulty.

Allocate to Health Pool: A portion of the EB is invested in the creature's Torso to become its HP. This is its raw durability. (e.g., 50% for a standard creature, 75% for a brute).

Allocate to Attack Pools: The remaining EB is invested into one or more Attack Pools. These function exactly like a player's Size Entropy (TLE-002), fueling the creature's primary attacks (e.g., "Claw," "Bite," "Fire Breath").

Determine ERR: For simplicity, a creature's Entropy Regeneration Rate can be set to 10% of its total EB per round (rounded down).

Assign Actions: The number of actions a creature can take is determined by its nature (e.g., 1 for a simple beast, 2-3 for a legendary monster).

Example: A 60 EP Ogre (Hard encounter for a party with an average TEP of ~48)

Health Pool: 30 EP invested in its Torso (30 HP).

Attack Pool: 30 EP invested in a "Greatclub" arm. It can spend up to 30 EP for a single massive 1d30 damage swing.

ERR: 6 EP per round.

Actions: 1 per turn.

## §4 · Designing Hazards & Traps
An environmental hazard or mechanical trap is the simplest form of challenge: a single, non-regenerating pool of Entropy designed to be spent once.

Mechanic: The hazard's Entropic Budget is its total damage potential. When triggered, it unleashes its full EB as an "attack." Players in the area of effect must use Active Defense (TLE-005) to block the incoming entropic force. Once its budget is spent, the trap is inert.

Example: A 25 EP Fire Trap. When triggered, it attacks everyone in a 10-foot radius with 25 entropic force. A character must spend 25 EP on Active Defense to negate the damage entirely. The trap is now disarmed.

## §5 · Designing Social Challenges
A social encounter uses the exact same principles as a combat encounter, but the battlefield is the mind.

The Principle: "Conversation as Combat" (TLE-007) pits the players against an NPC's mental defenses. The GM uses the encounter's Entropic Budget to "buy" the NPC's mental attributes.

Mechanic:

Assign an Entropic Budget (EB) for the social challenge.

Invest in Mental Pools: The GM allocates this EB into the NPC's Intelligence and Wisdom. These EP pools determine the NPC's Resolve (INT Score) and Composure (WIS Score), which act as their "health pools" in the conversation.

The Remainder: Any leftover EB becomes the NPC's pool for making their own "statements" (social attacks) during the conversation.

This unified system allows a GM to design any challenge in the game—a monster, a trap, or a tough negotiation—using one simple, consistent, and scalable mechanic.

## §6 · Assemblé
The world is a tapestry of will, and the GM is its primary weaver. The Entropic Budget is the universal thread from which all challenges are woven. A monster's rage, a trap's deadly spring, and a merchant's stubborn haggle are all expressions of the same fundamental force. By mastering this single principle, the Architect can build a world that is not only challenging but coherent, consistent, and deeply resonant with the laws of reality itself.
