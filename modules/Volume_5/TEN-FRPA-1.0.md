## §1 · Purpose
To identify, characterize, and analyze self-similar, fractal, or recursive patterns within a system's structure, dynamics, or information content, quantifying their complexity and understanding their role in system behavior and resonance phenomena.

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Many natural and artificial systems exhibit self-similarity or recursive structures, where patterns repeat at different scales or through iterative processes. These fractal-like characteristics are not mere curiosities but often fundamental to a system's efficiency, resilience, and information processing capabilities. Time-Adherence ($T_a$) can describe the coherence of these patterns across scales; Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) the boundary conditions of their growth or iteration; and the $K_i$ constant can modulate the rhythm or phase characteristics of recursive generation.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a$ measures the coherence of self-similar patterns across different scales or iterations. High $T_a$ implies a well-preserved fractal or recursive rule; low $T_a$ might indicate degradation or variation in the recursion.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: $\Gamma$ defines the boundary conditions or confinement for fractal growth or recursive processes. It can influence the 'space-filling' nature of a fractal or the termination conditions of a recursion.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ can govern the scaling factor or the 'beat' of recursive generation, especially if phases or oscillations are involved in the recursive rule. $K_i$-modulated wavelets might be used to detect self-similar structures with inherent rhythms (e.g., fractal dimension of Bloom events is $K_i$ dependent).
* **Fractal Dimension (Df)**: A primary output metric, $D_f$ quantifies the complexity and space-filling capacity of identified fractal patterns. It's a key characteristic derived from the analysis.
* **Recursion Depth / Iteration Count (N)**: Measures the number of levels of self-similarity or the number of iterations in a recursive process, indicating the extent of the pattern's development.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Data representing system structures (e.g., geometric shapes, network topologies, branching patterns), time-series exhibiting potential self-affine properties, or descriptions of processes involving iterative rules.
* **And Structure**: Geometric data (coordinate sets, image data). Network adjacency matrices. Time-series data. Algorithmic descriptions of recursive processes. Parameter values for iterated function systems (IFS).

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Pattern Identification: Apply the chosen `FractalDetectionMethod` or recursive rule analysis to the input data to identify potential self-similar or recursive structures.
2. Fractal Dimension Calculation: If fractal patterns are detected, calculate their Fractal Dimension ($D_f$) and other relevant geometric properties (e.g., lacunarity). For recursive processes, identify the generating rule and iteration count.
3. Pirouette Parameter Correlation: Analyze how the system's $T_a, \Gamma,$ and $K_i$ values correlate with the properties of the identified fractal/recursive patterns (e.g., how does $T_a$ affect the coherence of recursion? How does $\Gamma$ constrain fractal growth? Are there $K_i$-modulated rhythms in the pattern generation?).
4. Resonant Fractal/Recursive Vector Profiling: Evaluate the identified patterns and their host system against Twelve Resonant Fractal/Recursive Vectors (e.g., $V_1$ Scale Invariance Degree, $V_2$ Algorithmic Compressibility, $V_3$ Boundary Complexity ($D_f$ of boundary), $V_4$ Information Encoding Efficiency, $V_5$ Resilience via Redundancy (fractal systems are often fault-tolerant), $V_6$ Emergent Property Potential, $V_7$ Recursive Stability ($T_a$ of recursion), $V_8$ Growth/Iteration Dynamics, $V_9$ Inter-Scale Coherence, $V_{10}$ Attractor Basin Complexity (if fractal attractors), $V_{11}$ $K_i$-Modulated Generation, $V_{12}$ Universal Archetype Alignment (e.g., Koch curve, Mandelbrot set)).
5. Impact Assessment: Analyze how the identified fractal/recursive structures contribute to the overall system's behavior, properties (e.g., efficiency, stability, adaptability), or information processing capabilities.
6. Stability and Evolution: Assess the stability of the recursive generating rules or the conditions under which the fractal pattern might change, grow, or dissipate.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Identification of fractal/recursive patterns. Calculated Fractal Dimension ($D_f$). Description of recursive rules and iteration depth. Profile scores for the 12 Resonant Fractal/Recursive Vectors. Assessment of Pirouette parameter influence on pattern characteristics. Analysis of the pattern's impact on system properties.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Understanding of how self-similarity and recursion contribute to system complexity, efficiency, and resilience. Quantification of a system's 'fractalness'. Identification of generative rules underlying complex structures. Insights into information compression, error tolerance, and adaptive capacity conferred by such patterns. Recognition of universal archetypal forms.
* **Guidelines**: $D_f$ values indicate complexity (e.g., $D_f$ between 1 and 2 for a fractal curve). The profile of Fractal/Recursive Vectors reveals the specific functional roles of these patterns (e.g., high 'Information Encoding Efficiency'). Correlation with $T_a, \Gamma, K_i$ explains the dynamic context of these patterns. For example, the fractal dimension $D_f$ of a Bloom event is directly related to $K_i, T_a, \Gamma$.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Fractal Dimension (Box-Counting Example)
$$ D_f = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \frac{\log N(\epsilon)}{\log (1/\epsilon)} $$
Calculates fractal dimension $D_f$ where $N(\epsilon)$ is the number of boxes of size $\epsilon$ needed to cover the set.

### Recursive Rule (Conceptual)
$$ S_{n+1} = \mathcal{T}(S_n, P_{env}, K_i, T_a, \Gamma) $$
A state $S_{n+1}$ is generated by a transformation $\mathcal{T}$ of the previous state $S_n$, potentially influenced by environmental parameters $P_{env}$ and modulated by Pirouette parameters.

### Self-Similarity Correlation (Conceptual)
$$ C(L, l) = \langle Pattern(x, L) \cdot Pattern(x', l) \rangle $$
Measures correlation between a pattern observed at scale $L$ and a rescaled version at scale $l$ to detect self-similarity.

### Fractal Dimension of Bloom Events (from TPF Vol 2, Mod 16)
$$ D_f = 1 + \frac{K_i}{2\pi} \cdot \frac{T_a}{1-T_a} \cdot \Gamma^{-1/2} $$
Connects fractal dimension of generative expansions to core Pirouette parameters.
