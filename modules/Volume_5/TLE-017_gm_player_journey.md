This guide provides a framework for the long-term progression of a campaign in "The Lost Eternal." It outlines the major story arcs that players can pursue and introduces a reputation system to mechanically track their standing within the complex social ecosystem of the bottom realm.

## 1 · Major Campaign Arcs: The Eight Paths
The bottom realm is a sandbox of possibilities. While the immediate goal is survival, the world is rich with deeper mysteries and grander objectives. The GM should subtly weave hints of these eight major paths into the campaign, allowing the players to choose their own destiny. A party may pursue one, several, or even all of these goals over the course of their journey.

The Enigma of Heresy: Uncover the true identity of the being known as Heresy. This path involves piecing together scattered journal entries, deciphering ancient Skazan lore, and confronting the tragic history of the fallen empire.

The Path of Return: Discover a way to reverse the Skazan's translocation ritual, escape the bottom realm, and break the curse of forgetfulness placed upon your loved ones. This is a quest for personal redemption and a return to a life that was stolen.

The Unseen War: Take the fight to the Skazan Order. This path is a shadow war of infiltration, counter-espionage, and assassination, where players must identify and eliminate the Skazan's secret agents embedded within the realm's factions before they can be "harvested."

Forging a New Home: Abandon the idea of escape and carve out a new life. This path is about building something permanent in the wastes—founding a new village, taking control of a walking city, and becoming a power in your own right.

The Unification: Bring an end to the endless conflicts between the walking cities. This is a grand-scale political and military campaign of diplomacy, sabotage, and alliance-building, with the goal of uniting the disparate factions against a common foe.

The Heresies' Peace: The minor Heresies are eternally hunted by the great Heresy. Discover a way to shield them from their pursuer. Success could be rewarded with passage to any other plane of existence or even the chance to transcend your mortal form.

The Endless Horizon: The world is vast and filled with forgotten wonders and horrors. This path is for the pure explorer—the treasure hunter who wishes to chart the unknown, from the frozen hulks in the fields of wildflowers to the wrecked Skazan ships in the mountains.

The Greater Cosmos: The bottom realm is but one battlefield in a larger cosmic war. This path involves leaving the starting plane to engage with the Skazan Empire on its own turf, navigating interstellar politics, and taking the fight to a truly galactic scale.

## §2 · Faction & Reputation System
A character's actions have consequences. Their standing with the major factions of the bottom realm is tracked on a simple scale from -5 (Hated) to +5 (Revered).

The Cities (e.g., The Endeavor)

Reputation: Gained by completing quests for city leaders, protecting trade routes, and upholding the law. Lost by committing crimes and associating with nomads.

+5 (Revered): You are a hero of the city. You are granted a permanent residence and a say in political matters.

-5 (Hated): You are exiled and hunted. A bounty is placed on your head, and city guards will attack you on sight.

The Nomad Camps

Reputation: Gained by trading fairly, sharing intelligence, and raiding city-aligned targets. Lost by betraying their trust or siding with city law.

+5 (Revered): You are considered one of their own. You are given access to their black markets, secret routes, and can call on them for aid.

-5 (Hated): You are a primary target. Nomad raiding parties will actively hunt you through the wastes.

The Lepi

Reputation: Gained only through acts of profound respect, fair trade, and by protecting their neutrality. Lost by acts of aggression, disrespect, or by trying to force them to break their neutrality.

+5 (Revered): You are a trusted friend. The Lepi will grant you safe passage through the most dangerous territories and may even share intelligence on the Skazan Order.

-5 (Hated): You are shunned. The Lepi will refuse to trade or speak with you, effectively cutting you off from the realm's most knowledgeable guides.

The Skazan Order (Threat Meter)

This is not a reputation, but a Threat Level, starting at 0 and increasing. It is raised by accumulating TEP, defeating their agents, and interfering with their plans.

Threat 1-5: Your handler watches from a distance, occasionally sending minor obstacles your way to "fatten you up."

Threat 6-10: Your handler begins to take a more active role, hiring bandits or manipulating beasts to test your limits.

Threat 11+: You are no longer just an investment; you are a problem. The Skazan will dispatch powerful, specialized agents with the sole purpose of harvesting you by any means necessary.

## §3 · Mass Combat: The Phalanx Clash
When large groups of combatants clash, the battle can be resolved through a streamlined system that captures the brutal calculus of war.

The Combined Pool: Each side totals the TEP of all participants to create a single, massive pool of entropic force.

The Multiplier: Each side rolls a die with a number of sides equal to its number of participants. This result becomes their damage multiplier for the round.

The Clash: Each side multiplies its combined TEP by its multiplier roll. The two totals are then subtracted from each other. The losing side suffers casualties equal to the difference in entropic force.

Resolving Casualties: The damage is assigned to the combatants on the front lines first, then moves towards the middle and back ranks. If a tie-breaker is needed for simultaneous losses, roll a d2; on the first non-tied result of 1, that individual perishes.

Example: The King's Regiment vs. The Caustic Fen

A regiment of 30 soldiers (15 Paladins, 15 Spearmen) is sent to destroy the Jellymancer's lair.

The King's Regiment: Let's assume an average TEP of 75 for each of the 30 soldiers. Their combined pool is 2,250 TEP.

The Caustic Fen: The Jellymancer has siphoned the heroes' TEP, adding it to his lair. The Lair now has a TEP of 3,000, and it is defended by 20 empowered Acidic Slime Minions with an average of 50 TEP each (1,000 TEP total). The Fen's combined pool is 4,000 TEP.

The Clash:

The Regiment has 30 participants, so they roll a d30. They get a 22. Their total force is 2,250 * 22 = 49,500.

The Fen has 21 participants (20 slimes + the Lair itself), so it rolls a d21. It gets a 15. Its total force is 4,000 * 15 = 60,000.

The Outcome:

The Fen's force (60,000) overpowers the Regiment's (49,500). The difference is 10,500.

This damage is dealt to the Regiment. 10,500 damage is enough to annihilate the entire force of 30 soldiers (10,500 / 75 TEP per soldier = 140 casualties, far more than are present).

Result: The king's regiment marches into the Caustic Fen and is utterly dissolved by a tidal wave of empowered, acidic sludge. The lair is victorious.
