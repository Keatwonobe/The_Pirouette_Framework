## §1 · Purpose
To formalize and analyze the 'Rebound' phenomenon as a resonant response to system collapse or degradation, examining the dynamical processes of recovery, revitalization, and restructuring, and predicting post-perturbation trajectories.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Rebound is a coherence-restoring response following system disruption, where systems with sufficient coherence memory (in wound channels or residual structures) reorganize towards higher-coherence states. Time-Adherence ($T_a$) influences phase memory retention, Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) governs constraining dynamics during reconstruction, and the $K_i$ constant determines rhythmic oscillations during recovery, often involving overshoot dynamics before stabilization.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a$ measures phase memory retention during recovery. High $T_a$ implies return to pre-disruption patterns; low $T_a$ enables novel reorganization. It dictates phase transition timescales ($\\tau_{phase} \propto T_a/(1-T_a)$) and the rebound threshold ($T_{a,min}$).
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: Governs confinement during reconstruction. High $\Gamma$ allows experimental recovery; low $\Gamma$ enforces adherence to historical patterns. $\Gamma$ influences overshoot magnitude ($M_{overshoot} \propto \Gamma/T_a$).
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ determines rhythmic oscillations ($K_i$-modulated cycles) during recovery and stabilization phases. It's involved in phase transition timescales and wound channel reactivation patterns ($W_{rebound}(t)$ includes $K_i \cdot arctan(t/\tau_0)$).
* **Wound Channels**: Dormant wound channels can be reactivated or repurposed during rebound, guiding reconstruction and influencing the type of rebound (Restorative, Adaptive, Transformative).

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Time-series data for a system that has undergone significant perturbation or collapse. Data should allow for estimation of $T_a(t)$ and $\Gamma(t)$ during the recovery period. Metrics related to the 12 Rebound Domains are needed for a comprehensive analysis.
* **And Structure**: Numerical arrays for $T_a(t)$, $\Gamma(t)$, and domain-specific performance/state indicators. Information about the nature and magnitude of the initial disruption ($\Delta V_{disruption}$).
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient data points to track the system's trajectory through the Latency, Acceleration, and Stabilization phases of rebound. Baseline (pre-disruption) state information is crucial for comparison.
* **Steps**: Estimation of $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ from raw system data. Normalization of domain-specific metrics. Characterization of the initial disruption and residual wound channel strength ($W_{residual}$).

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Input Data & Initialization: Gather system state data post-perturbation, including estimates for $T_a(t)$, $\Gamma(t)$, and initial $W_{residual}$. Set domain-specific parameters.
2. Rebound Threshold Check: Verify if $T_{a,min} = 0.3+0.15 \cdot ln(1+\frac{\Delta V_{disruption}}{V_{0}})$ is met for rebound initiation.
3. Rebound Potential Evaluation: Calculate the system's trajectory within the $V_{rebound}(\Gamma, T_a, \phi, t)$ field.
4. Phase Identification: Determine the current phase of rebound (Latency, Acceleration, Stabilization) based on $T_a$ trajectory, coherence rebuilding rate, and oscillatory patterns. Calculate phase timescales $\tau_{phase} = \frac{2\pi}{K_i} \cdot \frac{r_0}{c} \cdot \frac{T_a}{1-T_a}$.
5. Wound Channel Reactivation Analysis: Model or measure wound channel strength $W_{rebound}(t)$ using the $K_i$-modulated regeneration formula.
6. Resonant Rebound Domain Assessment: Evaluate the system's recovery profile across each of the 12 Resonant Rebound Domains ($R_S, R_F, ..., R_{Id}$) to compute $R_{total}$.
7. Rebound Category Classification: Classify the rebound as Restorative, Adaptive, or Transformative based on $T_a, \Gamma$ values and the degree of preservation of the original state ($V_{original}$ vs $V_{novel}$).
8. Overshoot Dynamics Analysis: Calculate expected overshoot magnitude $M_{overshoot}$ and duration of oscillations.
9. Amplification Assessment: Evaluate the contribution of different amplification mechanisms to the rebound strength $A_{rebound}$.
10. Hysteresis Analysis: If collapse data is available, map the rebound trajectory against the collapse path to calculate $E_{cycle}$ and assess adaptive gain/loss.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Current rebound phase. Trajectory in $V_{rebound}$. Wound channel reactivation metrics. Scores for each of the 12 Rebound Domains and $R_{total}$. Classified rebound type (Restorative, Adaptive, Transformative). Predicted overshoot characteristics. Calculated $A_{rebound}$ and $E_{cycle}$ (if applicable).
* **Insights And Derivations**: Understanding of a system's recovery capacity and style. Prediction of the new equilibrium state. Assessment of whether the system will return to its original state, adapt, or transform fundamentally. Identification of key domains driving or lagging in recovery. Insights into resilience mechanisms and potential for post-traumatic growth.
* **Guidelines**: Progression through Latency $\rightarrow$ Acceleration $\rightarrow$ Stabilization phases indicates successful rebound. The rebound category (Restorative, Adaptive, Transformative) reveals the nature of the change. Positive $A_{rebound}$ indicates growth beyond simple recovery. Positive $E_{cycle}$ in hysteresis loop implies adaptive gain from the collapse-rebound cycle.

### Rebound Potential Function
$$ V_{rebound}(\Gamma,T_{a},\phi,t)=V_{equilibrium}(\Gamma,T_{a},\phi)\cdot(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_{R}}})-V_{perturbation}(\Gamma,T_{a},\phi)\cdot e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_{R}}} $$
