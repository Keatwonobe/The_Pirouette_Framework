## §1 · Purpose
Detects latent cultural coherence zones or 'wound-channel fields' using inverse resonance analysis to reveal historic attractor loci. This module surfaces hidden legacy patterns, suppressed traumas, and persistent resonance fields in collective memory.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Significant historical events, particularly those involving high emotional or physical energy (e.g., major conflicts, cultural golden ages, traumas), create exceptionally persistent wound channels in a collective geo-cultural field. These channels act as 'frozen attractors' or 'memory vortices' that can lock a region into specific resonant patterns. This module uses the inverse resonance logic of its parent: by comparing a region's current resonance field to a nominal 'healed' or 'neutral' baseline, it highlights the anomalies, revealing the shape and influence of these buried historical structures.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: Anomalously high or low $T_a$ in a specific geographic area can indicate a memory vortex. A 'frozen' memory (e.g., a perpetually re-enacted trauma) might show pathologically high $T_a$, while a 'chaotic' memory (e.g., a site of unresolved conflict) might show very low $T_a$. The persistence of the wound channel itself is also a function of its original $T_a$.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: The $\Gamma$ of a memory vortex's boundary describes its relationship with the surrounding culture. A low-$\Gamma$ boundary indicates a 'walled-off' or encapsulated memory (e.g., a taboo topic), while a high-$\Gamma$ boundary suggests the memory is actively and chaotically bleeding into the present.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ can govern the rhythmic or cyclical re-emergence of themes related to the memory vortex. Furthermore, resolving or healing such a vortex may require interventions (e.g., rituals, dialogues) with specific $K_i$-resonant timing to be effective.
* **Wound Channels**: This module is fundamentally about detecting and characterizing a specific class of wound channel: those created by collective, historical events that become embedded in a geographic and cultural landscape.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: A composite 'Spatiotemporal Cultural Field' dataset. This can include: historical records of events, sociopolitical resonance histories (e.g., voting patterns, conflict data), localized fluctuations in cultural output (e.g., from TEN-ARA), linguistic shifts, and overlays of collective myths and narratives, all tied to geographic coordinates and time.
* **And Structure**: Geospatial data layers (GIS), time-series of cultural indicators per region, network graphs of historical influence, textual corpora of myths and histories.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient historical and geographical data for a specific region to establish baseline cultural resonance patterns and identify statistically significant, persistent anomalies.
* **Steps**: Collation and geo-temporal alignment of diverse data sources. Extraction of cultural resonance metrics (e.g., coherence, sentiment, complexity) from raw data. Creation of a baseline 'nominal' cultural field for comparison.

### 3·2 · Operational Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `NominalCulturalTemplate` | A reference model of a 'healed' or 'neutral' cultural resonance field for the region, used as the baseline for the inverse mapping. This is a critical and context-sensitive input. | `A theoretical model or a field derived from a comparable, non-traumatized region.` |
| `VortexIntensityThreshold` | Minimum magnitude of misalignment (deviation from the nominal template) required to classify a region as a memory vortex. | `Statistical measure, e.g., > 3 standard deviations from the mean field difference.` |
| `WoundChannelDepthMetric` | The function used to calculate the 'depth' of a wound channel, often related to the integrated intensity of the misalignment over time and space. | `Integral of misalignment magnitude.` |
| `ReintegratabilityIndexFunction` | A function that computes the potential for a memory vortex to be healed or reintegrated, based on its characteristics (e.g., depth, boundary $\Gamma$) and the coherence of the surrounding cultural field. | `A custom function based on Pirouette stability principles.` |

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. 1. Project Resonance Fields: Overlay the observed spatiotemporal cultural field onto the chosen geographical and historical coordinates.
2. 2. Generate Anomaly Map: Using the logic of its parent module (TEN-RFD-1.0), compare the observed field to the `NominalCulturalTemplate` to generate a misalignment map, highlighting deviations.
3. 3. Isolate Memory Vortices: Identify contiguous regions on the anomaly map that exceed the `VortexIntensityThreshold`. These are the candidate memory vortices or 'frozen attractors'.
4. 4. Characterize Wound Channels: For each vortex, apply `WoundChannelDepthMetric` to quantify its historical impact. Analyze its boundary characteristics to determine its effective $\Gamma$. Trace its influence on surrounding areas.
5. 5. Quantify Persistence and Reintegratability: Analyze the temporal data associated with the vortex to generate a 'Temporal Persistence Curve' (e.g., using TEN-DDA-1.0). Calculate the 'Collective Reintegratability Index' using the defined function.
6. 6. Compile Atlas: Assemble the characterized vortices and their properties into the final 'Cultural Resonance Atlas'.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: A 'Cultural Resonance Atlas' which includes: [A map with Memory Vortex Coordinates, a quantified Wound Channel Depth for each vortex, a Temporal Persistence Curve for each vortex, and a Collective Reintegratability Index for each vortex].
* **Insights And Derivations**: Identification of suppressed historical traumas or persistent cultural memories that invisibly influence present-day society. A map of 'sacred' or 'haunted' ground in a cultural-geographic sense. Understanding how historical events remain 'locked' in a region's resonance. A diagnostic tool for truth and reconciliation efforts.
* **Guidelines**: Memory vortices represent unresolved historical coherence patterns. Wound Channel Depth indicates the magnitude of the original event's impact. A long Temporal Persistence Curve indicates a deeply embedded memory. A low Reintegratability Index suggests that healing or resolving the memory will be difficult and may require significant, targeted effort (e.g., 'symbolic activation'). The output maps are nonlinear and reflect resonance fields, which are the *influence* of events, not necessarily the events themselves.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Cultural Misalignment Field
$$ \Delta C(\vec{x}, t) = |C_{observed}(\vec{x}, t) - C_{nominal}(\vec{x}, t)| $$
Calculates the deviation of the observed cultural resonance field from a nominal baseline, identifying potential memory vortices.

### Memory Vortex Intensity
$$ \xi_{vortex} = \nabla \times \vec{F}_{cultural} $$
Conceptually, the intensity of a memory vortex can be modeled as the curl of an abstract 'cultural force field', indicating a zone of unresolved, circulating energy or information.

### Wound Channel Depth (Integral Form)
$$ D_{WC} = \int_{Area} \int_{Time} \Delta C(\vec{x}, t) \cdot w(\vec{x}, t) \,dt \,dA $$
Quantifies the total impact of a historical wound channel by integrating the misalignment field over its area and time, with an optional weighting function $w$.

### Collective Reintegratability Index (Conceptual)
$$ I_{reint} = f(T_a^{surrounding}, 1/\Gamma^{vortex}, 1/D_{WC}) $$
A conceptual function estimating the potential for a memory vortex to be healed, favored by a coherent surrounding culture, a non-rigid (higher $\Gamma$) vortex boundary, and a less severe initial trauma (lower depth).
