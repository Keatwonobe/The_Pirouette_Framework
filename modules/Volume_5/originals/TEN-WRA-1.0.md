## §1 · Purpose
To analyze and model 'Will' as an active, internally-sourced coherence field that directs an entity's actions, shapes its reality engagement, and drives intentional change by generating a self-consistent resonant potential.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Will is conceptualized as a self-generated, coherent resonant field that an entity projects to influence its state and environment, effectively creating its own attractors in parameter space. Its strength and effectiveness depend on high internal Time-Adherence ($T_a^{will}$ – clarity and consistency of intent), well-defined conceptual boundaries (optimal $\Gamma^{will}$ – focus without rigidity), and $K_i$-resonant alignment of actions with goals. Will creates 'forward wound channels' of intention.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a^{will}$ represents the coherence and temporal consistency of an entity's intent and focus ($T_a^{will} = \frac{1}{N} \sum |\langle\Psi_{action,i}|\Psi_{intent}\rangle|^2$). High $T_a^{will}$ (e.g., >0.9) is characteristic of strong Will. It's a key component of WSI and $F_{will}$.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: $\Gamma^{will}$ reflects the boundary strength and focus of the Will; optimal $\Gamma^{will}$ is low enough for precise direction but high enough to overcome minor obstacles ($\\Gamma^{will} = \Gamma_0 / (FocusScore \cdot T_a^{will})$). It influences WSI and $F_{will}$.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ governs the rhythmic application of Will, the phasing of actions for maximum impact, and the resonant frequencies of the Will Potential Field ($V_{will}$ involves $\cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{goal})$). $K_i$-modulated persistence creates $\Phi_{will}$.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: $V_{will}$ depends on phase alignment $\phi$ between intent, action, and environmental receptivity. $F_{will}$ includes a $\cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{goal})$ term reflecting this alignment.
* **Wound Channels**: Will projects $\Phi_{will}$, a forward wound channel of intent that shapes future possibilities and guides action. Its strength and coherence determine the Will's effectiveness.
* **Funnel Inversion**: Strong, sustained Will can drive 'Will-Driven Funnel Inversions,' leading to profound personal or systemic transformations as the entity reshapes its own reality or that of its environment.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Data describing an entity's stated goals and intentions, observed actions, internal states (e.g., self-reported focus, emotional congruence, conviction levels), resource mobilization, and responses to obstacles. Information for scoring against the 12 Dimensions of Will.
* **And Structure**: Goal statements, strategic plans, behavioral logs, psychometric data (if available for internal states), resource audits. Qualitative or quantitative assessments for the 12 Dimensions of Will.
* **Viable Data Set**: Clear articulation of intent/goal, observable actions towards the goal, and some basis for estimating the entity's $T_a^{will}$ (consistency) and $\Gamma^{will}$ (focus/flexibility).
* **Steps**: Quantification or scoring of the 12 Dimensions of Will. Estimation of $T_a^{will}$ (e.g., from consistency of actions with stated intent) and $\Gamma^{will}$ (e.g., from ability to maintain focus amidst distractions vs. adaptability). Mapping of goal state $\Psi_{goal}$ and current state $\Psi_{current}$.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Entity Profiling & Goal Definition: Characterize the entity's baseline state, its stated intent/goal ($\Psi_{goal}$), and estimate its intrinsic $T_a^{will}$ and $\Gamma^{will}$ capacities.
2. Dimensions of Will Assessment: Evaluate the entity's current expression of Will against each of the 12 Dimensions of Will ($W_1$ Clarity of Intent ... $W_{12}$ Transcendental Alignment).
3. Will Potential Field ($V_{will}$) Modeling: Model the $V_{will}(\Gamma, T_a, \phi) = \sum \delta_k W_k$ that the entity is generating or navigating within, based on its dimensional profile and intent.
4. Will Force ($F_{will}$) Calculation: Calculate the effective Will Force $F_{will} = C_W \cdot rac{T_a^{will}}{\Gamma^{will} L_{goal}} \cdot (\sum \delta_k W_k^{active}) \cdot \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{goal})$ (where $L_{goal}$ is conceptual distance to goal, $W_k^{active}$ are manifested Will dimensions).
5. Will Wound Channel ($\\Phi_{will}$) Analysis: Model the $\Phi_{will}$ projected by the entity towards its goal. Analyze its coherence, strength, and persistence ($S_{channel} \propto T_a^{will} / \Gamma^{will}$).
6. Will Stability Index (WSI) Calculation: Compute $WSI = w_{Ta}T_a^{will} + w_{\Gamma}(1-\Gamma^{will}) + w_F (F_{will}/F_{max})$ to assess the robustness and sustainability of the entity's Will.
7. Will-Driven Funnel Inversion Potential: Assess if sustained $F_{will}$ is sufficient to overcome $V_{will,crit}$ and induce a transformative change in the entity or its environment.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Profile scores for the 12 Dimensions of Will. Calculated $T_a^{will}, \Gamma^{will}$. Modeled $V_{will}$ landscape. Estimated $F_{will}$. Characteristics of $\Phi_{will}$. WSI value. Assessment of Funnel Inversion potential.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Quantitative understanding of an entity's capacity for self-directed action and intentional change. Identification of strengths and weaknesses in its expression of Will. Assessment of the likelihood of achieving its goals. Insights into how to cultivate stronger, more effective Will.
* **Guidelines**: High WSI ($>0.8$ considered strong) indicates robust and effective Will. The profile of Will Dimensions highlights specific areas for development (e.g., low 'Clarity of Intent' $W_1$, or poor 'Resource Mobilization' $W_5$). High $F_{will}$ indicates strong capacity to overcome obstacles. A coherent $\Phi_{will}$ suggests a clear path of influence. Potential for Funnel Inversion suggests capacity for profound self-transformation or environmental impact.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Will Potential Field
$$ V_{will}(\Gamma, T_a, \phi) = \sum_{k=1}^{12} \delta_k W_k(\Gamma, T_a, \phi) $$
Defines the potential field generated or navigated by an entity's Will, as a weighted sum of 12 Dimensions of Will $W_k$.

### Will Force Equation
$$ F_{will} = C_W \cdot \frac{T_a^{will}}{\Gamma^{will} L_{goal}} \cdot (\sum \delta_k W_k^{active}) \cdot \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{goal}) $$
Calculates the effective force exerted by Will, based on its coherence $T_a^{will}$, focus $\Gamma^{will}$, distance to goal $L_{goal}$, active Will dimensions, and $K_i$-modulated phase alignment with the goal.

### Will Stability Index (WSI)
$$ WSI = w_{Ta}T_a^{will} + w_{\Gamma}(1-\Gamma^{will}_{eff}) + w_F (F_{will}/F_{max}) $$
Overall index of Will strength, coherence, and effectiveness, based on weighted $T_a^{will}$, effective focus $\Gamma^{will}_{eff}$, and achieved force $F_{will}$ relative to maximum potential $F_{max}$. (Note: $\Gamma^{will}_{eff}$ is effective focus, so $1-\Gamma^{will}_{eff}$ for high focus contributing positively).

### Will Wound Channel Strength (Conceptual)
$$ S_{channel}(\Phi_{will}) \propto \frac{T_a^{will}}{\Gamma^{will}} \cdot \text{ConvictionScore} $$
The strength of the forward wound channel projected by Will, influenced by its coherence, focus, and the entity's conviction.
