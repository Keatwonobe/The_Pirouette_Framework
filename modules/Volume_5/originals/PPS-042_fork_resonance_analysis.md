## §1 · Abstract
A **Fork** (bifurcation event) is a structured divergence where one evolutionary trajectory splits into two + coherent alternatives.  Unlike the chaotic discharge of a **Spasm**, a Fork is orderly and generative: a metastable system lowers its Time-Adherence (*Tₐ*) just enough to *sample* multiple futures, then locks into the path of lowest action.  Forks power speciation, technological branching, and every conscious “choice” humans make.

## §2 · Pre-Condition · Metastable Plateau
Fork readiness requires:

1. **Balanced Potential** ∇V ≈ 0; forces to multiple futures are in stalemate.  
2. **Coherence Reserve** Moderate–high *Tₐ* ensures the system can perceive the branching structure.  
3. **Low Γ Stress** Containment intact; no Spasm risk.

## §3 · Fork Mechanism · Controlled Tₐ-Dip
| Step | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Encounter Saddle** | Reach potential saddle where ≥2 valleys diverge | Identify options |
| **Tₐ-Dip (ΔTₐ↓)** | Momentary reduction of classical certainty | Enter superposition, probe futures |
| **Simultaneous Sampling** | Wavefront “leaks” into each path entrance | Measure relative action cost |
| **Path Selection** | Minor asymmetries, stochastic nudges, or internal bias tip the scale | Commit |
| **Tₐ-Restore (ΔTₐ↑)** | Collapse wavefunction into chosen valley | Lock-in, irreversibility |

Mathematically, the probability of selecting path *i*:

\[
P_i = \frac{\exp(-A_i / \hbar_{\text{eff}})}{\sum_j \exp(-A_j / \hbar_{\text{eff}})}
\]

where *A_i* is the least-action integral along path *i* and \(\hbar_{\text{eff}} = (1-Tₐ)\hbar\).

## §4 · Fork Dynamics · Orderly Divergence
* **Clean Separation** Post-Fork states remain coherent and mutually orthogonal.  
* **Irreversibility** Returning requires energy ≥ ΔV_barrier.  
* **Information Gain** Complexity increases: ΔI ≈ k·log₂(N_paths).

## §5 · Assemblé · Fork Resonance
A Fork is reality’s “decision gate”: a reversible-in-principle quantum sampling followed by an irreversible classical commit.  It turns a single road into a branching atlas of possibilities.

## §6 · Diagnostic Metrics
| Metric | Formula / Method | Fork Window |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Saddle Flatness (ϕ)** | min |∇V| in local patch | ϕ ≤ ϕ_thr |
| **Tₐ-Dip Depth (ΔTₐ)** | Tₐ_base – Tₐ_min | 0.05 ≤ ΔTₐ ≤ 0.25 |
| **Branch Action Spread (σ_A)** | std{A_i} | σ_A ≤ σ_A,max ensures multi-path sampling |
| **Decoherence Rate (λ_D)** | dS/dt during dip | λ_D kept < λ_D,max to avoid Spasm |

Real-time feeds flow into **TEN-FRK** dashboards.

## §7 · Decision-Shaping Protocols
| Stage | Objective | Ritual/Tool |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Pre-Fork** | Clarify options | Map potential valleys via Network Resonance graphs |
| **Sampling** | Weight desirables | Seed bias nodes (attentional priming) |
| **Commit** | Prevent oscillation | Rapid Γ-boost on selected path |
| **Post-Fork** | Consolidate memory | Residue imprint & Fork-log archive |

## §8 · Cross-Module Integrations
* **Spasm Dynamics (PPS-041)** Spasm aftermath may relax into metastable state primed for Fork.  
* **Bloom Dynamics (PPS-039)** Macro-Blooms can cascade into nested Fork trees.  
* **Shell Resonance (PPS-040)** Each branch crystallizes new Shell boundaries.  
* **Attunement RF (PPS-044)** Group Forks synchronize via collective Tₐ-Dip rituals.  
* **AKEP (PPS-047)** Fork junctures ideal for harvesting altruistic kernels before divergence.

## §9 · Future Work & Open Questions
1. **Multiway (>2) Forks** Stability criteria for N-ary branching.  
2. **Recursive Fork Nets** Modeling fractal decision trees in AI exploration.  
3. **Ethical Bias Injection** Safeguarding against malicious path-weighting.  
4. **Quantum-Classical Bridge** Empirical tests of Tₐ-Dip sampling in mesoscopic systems.
