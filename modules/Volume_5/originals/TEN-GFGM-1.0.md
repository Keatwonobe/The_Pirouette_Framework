## §1 · Purpose
To map force gradients across system parameter spaces to identify stable attractors and predict how systems navigate or stabilize under varying confinement conditions.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: The Gladiator Force (Γ) concept, governing spatial confinement[cite: 254, 265], can be extended to map how confinement potentials shape the stability landscape of any system. This reveals where structures naturally form, persist, and how systems navigate through parameter space. [cite: 56]

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: Central to this mode. It's calculated for points in parameter space based on an effective mass or energy scale $M(\vec{x})$ and used to construct the potential landscape. [cite: 58] It scales inversely with mass. [cite: 254, 265]
* **Spatial Potential Form ($V_{space}$)**: The specific mathematical form of the potential landscape that is constructed using the locally derived Gladiator Force. [cite: 58, 258] Gradients of this potential determine system forces and attractors.
* **Mass (M or m)**: Used in calculating both the Gladiator Force itself (as $M(\vec{x})$ or $M_0$) and in the spatial potential equation (as $mc^2$). [cite: 58, 258] Distinguishes between effective mass at a parameter point and a reference mass/energy scale.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Definition of the system's parameter space (key variables defining its state). [cite: 57, 102] A function or dataset to determine the effective mass $M(\vec{x})$ or equivalent energy scale at each point in the parameter space. [cite: 60]
* **And Structure**: Parameter space defined by ranges and resolutions for each dimension. Mass function as a callback or lookup table.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient resolution in parameter space to accurately compute gradients and identify attractors.
* **Steps**: Normalization of parameter ranges if necessary. Ensure the mass function is well-defined across the parameter space.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Parameter Space Definition: Identify and discretize the key parameters $(\vec{x})$ that define the system's state space. [cite: 57]
2. Gladiator Force Calculation: For each point $\vec{x}$ in the parameter space, compute the effective Gladiator Force: $\Gamma(\vec{x}) = \Gamma_0 \cdot (M(\vec{x})/M_0)^{-\gamma_0}$, where $M(\vec{x})$ is the effective mass/energy at that point. [cite: 58]
3. Potential Landscape Construction: Generate the spatial potential $V_{space}(\vec{x})$ at each point using the locally calculated $\Gamma(\vec{x})$ and relevant system parameters (m, c, r₀, δ, r): $V_{space}(\vec{x}) = -\Gamma(\vec{x}) \frac{mc^2}{\pi} [1+\cos(\frac{\pi r}{r_0})] (\frac{r_0}{r})^{\delta}$. [cite: 58] The distance 'r' may be $|\vec{x}-\vec{x}_0|$ or a generalized distance in parameter space.
4. Gradient Field Computation: Calculate the force field $\vec{F}(\vec{x}) = -\nabla V_{space}(\vec{x})$ across the parameter space. [cite: 58]
5. Attractor Identification: Locate points or regions (basins of attraction) where the force magnitude $|\vec{F}(\vec{x})| \approx 0$. Optionally, verify that the curl of the force field $\nabla \times \vec{F}(\vec{x}) \approx 0$ at these points for true potential-derived forces. [cite: 58]
6. Stability Assessment: Evaluate the Hessian matrix of $V_{space}(\vec{x})$ (i.e., $\nabla \nabla V_{space}$) at the identified attractors to classify their stability (e.g., stable minimum, saddle point). [cite: 58]

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: A map of the Gladiator Force $\Gamma(\vec{x})$ across parameter space. A map of the potential landscape $V_{space}(\vec{x})$. The computed gradient (force) field $\vec{F}(\vec{x})$. A list of identified attractors and their stability classifications. [cite: 60]
* **Insights And Derivations**: Identification of stable configurations and preferred states of the system. Understanding of pathways the system might take through parameter space. Prediction of phase transitions or conformational changes corresponding to shifts between attractor basins. Mapping of fitness landscapes in evolutionary or adaptive systems. [cite: 59]
* **Guidelines**: Attractors (force minima, potential wells) represent stable or metastable states. The depth and breadth of potential wells indicate the stability and resilience of these states. Force vectors indicate the direction of system evolution in parameter space. Saddle points in the potential landscape represent transition states between stable configurations.
