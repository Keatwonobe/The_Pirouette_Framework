## §1 · Purpose
To compute an optimal trajectory for an entity through a parameter space by navigating along the gradients of a defined potential field, considering the influences of Time-Adherence, Gladiator Force, and Ki-resonant features on the path's feasibility and cost.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: An entity's evolution through a parameter space (physical, cognitive, or social) can be modeled as pathfinding on a potential energy landscape. The optimal path is not necessarily the shortest geometrically, but is one of 'least action' that follows the negative gradient of the potential field. The entity's own Pirouette parameters ($T_a, \Gamma$) act as friction or momentum terms, while the field's $K_i$ resonances can create cyclical attractors or 'resonant shortcuts' that modify the simplest gradient descent trajectory.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Potential Field (V)**: The primary input. The landscape upon which pathfinding occurs. Its gradients ($-\nabla V$) define the force field guiding the entity.
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a$ of the entity can be modeled as 'inertial coherence' or resistance to changing direction. The coherence of the path itself can be calculated as a function of the $T_a$ of the medium it traverses.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: The $\Gamma$ of the medium along a path can be modeled as friction or resistance, increasing the 'cost' of traversing high-$\Gamma$ regions. Low-$\Gamma$ zones are preferred pathways.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: Can define cyclical attractors (limit cycles) or resonant frequencies in the potential field that influence the path. Optimal pathfinding may involve synchronizing steps with $K_i$-resonant rhythms.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: 1) A potential field map $V(\vec{x})$ over a discretized parameter space. 2) A starting coordinate $\vec{x}_{start}$. 3) An optional target coordinate $\vec{x}_{end}$ or a termination condition (e.g., reaching any local minimum). 4) The entity's own Pirouette parameters, which influence the pathfinding cost.
* **And Structure**: Potential field as a 2D or 3D numerical grid. Start/end points as vectors. Entity parameters as a structured object.
* **Viable Data Set**: A defined potential field map and a starting point.
* **Steps**: Ensure potential field grid has sufficient resolution for accurate numerical gradient calculation. Normalize field values and parameter space dimensions if necessary.

### 3·2 · Operational Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `pathfindingAlgorithm` | The algorithm used to find the path. 'GradientDescent' is the default Pirouette method. 'A_Star' or 'Dijkstra' can be used on the grid for finding paths between specific points. | `['GradientDescent', 'A_Star', 'SimulatedAnnealing']` |
| `stepSize_alpha` | The learning rate or step size for the Gradient Descent algorithm. | `Small positive real number (e.g., 0.01 - 0.1).` |
| `noiseTerm_zeta_magnitude` | Magnitude of the stochastic noise term to be added at each step, allowing for escape from shallow local minima. | `Real number, typically small relative to gradient magnitudes.` |
| `pathCostFunction` | The function used to evaluate the total 'cost' of a path, which can include geometric length, integrated potential, and coherence costs. | `e.g., Cost = w1 * length + w2 * ∫(1-Ta)dl + w3 * ∫Γdl` |

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. 1. Load Potential Field: Ingest the potential field map $V(\vec{x})$.
2. 2. Compute Force Field: Numerically calculate the negative gradient of the potential field to get the force field: $\vec{F}(\vec{x}) = -\nabla V(\vec{x})$. This is the primary driver for pathfinding.
3. 3. Initialize Path: Set the first point of the path, $P_0 = \vec{x}_{start}$.
4. 4. Iterate to Find Path: Based on the chosen `pathfindingAlgorithm`:
   - For 'GradientDescent': Iteratively calculate the next point: $\vec{x}_{n+1} = \vec{x}_n + \text{stepSize_alpha} \cdot \vec{F}(\vec{x}_n) + \vec{\zeta}(t)$.
   - For 'A_Star': Use the force field magnitude and `pathCostFunction` to determine edge weights and find the optimal path from $\vec{x}_{start}$ to $\vec{x}_{end}$.
5. 5. Termination: Stop when the path reaches the target coordinate $\vec{x}_{end}$, converges on a local minimum ($|\vec{F}(\vec{x})| \approx 0$), or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
6. 6. Path Metrics Calculation: Once the path is determined, calculate its total length, integrated cost using the `pathCostFunction`, and identify any major potential barriers traversed.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: { 'pathCoordinates': [ (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ... ], 'pathMetrics': { 'totalLength': value, 'totalCost': value, 'coherenceCost': value, 'barriersCrossed': int } }.
* **Insights And Derivations**: The most probable trajectory a system will take given a starting point. A clear visualization of the path of least resistance. Identification of energy barriers between stable states and the optimal pathways to cross them. A prescriptive guide for processes, learning, or strategic maneuvers.
* **Guidelines**: The generated path represents the evolution of least action. Segments of the path where progress is slow or direction changes rapidly indicate regions of high potential or steep barriers. The 'coherence cost' quantifies how much a path deviates from regions of high systemic coherence ($T_a$).

## §7 · Integration & Use Cases
### 7·1 · Integration Hooks
* **Dependencies**: Requires a potential field map as input. This is the canonical output of `TEN-GFGM-1.0` (Gladiator Force Gradient Mapping). Can also use potential fields from `TEN-PSA-1.0`, `TEN-CJSA-1.0`, `TEN-NDA-1.0`, etc.
* **Applications**: The computed path can be used as an input for `TEN-PLA-1.0` (Planning Resonance Analysis) to turn the trajectory into a concrete plan. The path itself can be analyzed for its own characteristics, such as its fractal dimension (`TEN-FRPA-1.0`) or decay properties (`TEN-DDA-1.0`).
