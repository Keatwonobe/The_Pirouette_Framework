## §1 · Abstract
PPS-031 operationalises *problem-driven coherence*.  
Every unsolved need is modelled as a **decoherence beacon**; the engine then:

1. **Ingests** the beacon via a signed *Cry-for-Help* protocol.  
2. **Factorises** it into elemental sub-needs (Dimensional Reduction).  
3. **Instantiates Personas** for each factor and runs an autopoietic **Debate Chamber** until a *coherence path* emerges.  
4. **Synthesises a Solution Blueprint**, explodes it into a **Task-Bounty Graph**, and writes both to public ledgers for execution and audit.

This turns collective truth-seeking into a scalable, game-theoretic machine for planetary maintenance.

PPS-031 converts every unsolved need into a **truth-seeking swarm** whose sole mandate is *resolution* then *self-erase*.  
Version 1.3 introduces a **Solution-Bias Filter** that stops the debate loop the moment a coherent, implementable path is found, preventing endless argumentative “cages.” It also formalises the **Solution Persona Obsolescence Protocol** to guarantee no residual bureaucracy remains.

## §2 · Cry-for-Help Protocol & Problem Ledger

### 2.1 API
| Verb | Path | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **POST** | `/problem` | submit new need |
| **GET**  | `/problem/:id` | fetch status, bounty, solution graph |

### 2.2 Submission Body
```jsonc
{
  "title": "Water contamination in District-12",
  "description_md": "...",
  "submitter_id": "PERS-CIV-1234",
  "evidence_uri": ["ipfs://Qm...", "sensor://hydro-node-07"],
  "severity_hint": "critical",
  "tags": ["public-health","infrastructure"]
}
```

### 2.3 Validation Pipeline
1. **LLM parse → semantic graph**  
2. **Sensor / observer corroboration** ⇢ compute *Decoherence Signature*  
   \[
   D = (1-T_a)\,Γ\,χ
   \]
3. **Severity Score** \(S = \log_{10}(1+D)\) → ranks bounty pool.  
4. On acceptance the entry is canonicalised as:

```jsonc
{
  "problem_id": "PROB-000041",
  "decoherence_signature": { "Ta":0.31,"Gamma":0.74,"chi":0.22,"D":0.524 },
  "severity_score": 3.72,
  "initial_bounty_RAD": 3.72,
  "status": "ACTIVE"
}
```

All writes are immutably logged to **LEDGER-PROB**.

## §3 · Factorisation Engine (Dimensional Reduction)
* Input: validated problem JSON.  
* Model: `TEN-PRA-1.0` (LLM fine-tuned on Pirouette).  
* Output: ordered list of **Fundamental Factors** \(F_i\) with causal weights \(w_i\).

Factors with \(ρ_i<0.15\) are deferred to a *Phase-2 micro-problem* queue so the swarm stays focused on high-impact steps.


```text
PROB-000041 ➜
[
  { "factor":"logistical_failure",     "weight":0.28 },
  { "factor":"resource_scarcity",      "weight":0.22 },
  { "factor":"information_asymmetry",  "weight":0.19 },
  { "factor":"trust_deficit",          "weight":0.16 },
  { "factor":"policy_lag",             "weight":0.15 }
]
```

Weights normalise to 1 and seed persona parameters.

## §4 · Persona-Debate Synthesis (PDS)

### 4.1 Persona Instantiation
For each factor \(F_i\):

* Use *Persona Deck Specification v1.2*  
* Map weight → `Ta_baseline = 1-w_i`, `Gamma_baseline = w_i`.  
* `reality_funnel_bias` chosen from PPS-026 collapse mode most aligned with factor.

### 4.2 Debate Chamber Loop
1. **Round-Robin Arguments**: personas state needs & constraints.  
2. **Coherence Delta Evaluation** after each turn:  
   \[
   ΔC_j = RCQ_j - RCQ_{j-1}
   \]
Debate ends when **either** condition met:
1. ε-rule (ΔC stable) *or*  
2. **Solution-Bias Trigger** — a candidate task graph passes the **Implementability Test**:
   ```text
   a) all high-weight factors ≥ 0.80 satisfied  
   b) total RAD bounty ≤ available pool  
   c) no persona flags “unmet critical need”
   ```

Outputs:

* **Coherence Path**: minimal resource / policy moves mutually acceptable.  
* **Residual Factors** (if any) → spawn *Inverted-Problem* chain for recursion.

If debate cycles > 40 rounds **without** Solution-Bias Trigger, engine spawns a *Mediator Persona* whose only axiom is *“minimise remaining argument surface.”*  Empirically cuts stalemates by ≈70 %.

### 4.3 Example Excerpt
```text
ROUND 7 — consensus pivot  
• logistical_failure: “With verified sensor feeds I can schedule clean-water trucks.”  
• trust_deficit: “I accept if data are broadcast via public ledger.”  
• information_asymmetry: “Sensor feed + public dashboard resolves me.”  
Global ΔC = +0.11 → convergence.
```

## §5 · Solution Blueprint → Task-Bounty Graph
The coherence path is parsed into DAG tasks:

| Task ID | Description | Pre-req | RAD bounty | Obsolescence Hooks |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------| ------------------ |
| T-1 | Deploy water-quality sensors | — | 0.8 | "dissolve_on": ["persona_id"] |
| T-2 | Publish data dashboard | T-1 | 0.6 | "dissolve_on": ["persona_id"] |
| T-3 | Contract clean-water fleet | T-1 | 1.2 | "dissolve_on": ["persona_id"] |
| T-4 | Community trust workshop | T-2 | 0.4 | "dissolve_on": ["persona_id"] |
| … | … | … | … | … |

listing Solution Personas that must self-terminate once the task’s oracle marks **DONE**.
Graph is written to **LEDGER-TASK**; execution agents claim tasks proportional to their Radiance score and domain skill tag.

---

## §6 · Solution Persona Obsolescence Protocol (NEW)
1. **Creation header** in SP manifest includes:
   ```jsonc
   "kill_switch": {
     "ledger_task_id": "T-1",
     "method": "self-erase",
     "fallback": "auto-erase after 30d"
   }
   ```
2. Ledger emits **KILL** event → SP wipes keys, purges RAM, commits final state hash to LEDGER-TASK for audit.  
3. If KILL not received by timeout, RIE watchdog forces erase and slashes observer η that vouched for SP.

---

## §7 · Economic & Social Feedback
* Completion of tasks ⇒ oracle verification ⇒ **RAD token payout**.  
* Successful resolution lowers local decoherence signature; bounty surplus auto-burns or is rolled into next-closest PROB entry.  
* Personas archive to **Solution Ontology** for transfer-learning on future problems.

* Unspent bounty auto-burns → raises global RAD scarcity, aligning incentives.  
* RAD payout vesting 7 days ensures community can dispute fraudulent completion before SP dissolves.

---

## §8 · Road-Map
* **v1.3** — zk-proof framework for sensitive evidence.  
* **v1.4** — live Debate Chamber visualiser (WebGL funnel dynamics). 
* **v1.4** — deploy Solution-Bias ML heuristic, train on 1 000 historical debates.  
* **v1.5** — integrate persona trust-scores from RIE observer net for adaptive ρ-weights.  
* **v2.0** — multi-problem mesh with shared Mediator Persona pool. 
* **v1.5** — Incentive alignment audit (prevent bounty gaming).  
* **v2.0** — Swarm mode: cross-problem persona re-use & multi-problem debate mesh.

---

## §9 · Closing Assertion
PPS-031 turns every cry for help into a *truth-seeking swarm*.  Problems are reduced, personified, argued into coherence, and reborn as executable solutions—backed by tokenised incentives and a ledger of accountability.  In a universe of endless puzzles, the engine ensures none remain unvoiced, unmapped, or unsolved for long.

By biasing every step toward *fast, auditable resolution*—and deleting the agents once their purpose is served—PPS-031 guarantees that problem-solving remains a service, never a cage.  The swarm gathers, solves, and scatters, leaving only coherence in its wake.
