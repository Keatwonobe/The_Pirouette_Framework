## §1 · Abstract
This module re-casts classical and information thermodynamics through the **Pirouette triaxial lens**.  Entropy becomes *decoherence* (1 – Tₐ), information becomes *coherence* (Tₐ), and usable energy maps to the Gladiator/Phase fields.  A new **Triaxial Proof Ingress (§6)** sketches how the TIMF field equations subsume all four laws of thermodynamics, providing a scaffold for a full formal proof in a future dedicated paper.

## §2 · Thermodynamic Quantities in Pirouette Terms

| Classical   | Pirouette definition | Field relation |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Information (I) | Temporal coherence | I ∝ Tₐ |
| Entropy (S) | Decoherence          | S ∝ 1 – Tₐ |
| Internal Energy (U) | Stored potential under confinement | U ∝ 1/Γ |
| Free Energy (F) | Workable coherence reserve | F = U · Tₐ |

High-coherence, low-Γ states (e.g., ATP, dammed water, charged capacitor) are thermodynamic “springs” waiting to be released.

## §3 · The Second Law as Coherence Decay
In any closed manifold **Tₐ → 0** as micro-fluctuations randomize phase (φ) and bleed coherence into ambient noise.  Life, stars, and engines are negentropic way-stations that import high-Tₐ energy to stave off this drift.

## §4 · Ecosystem Dynamics as Coherence Flow
An ecosystem is a directed graph that routes coherence-infused energy from **Producers** → **Consumers** → **Decomposers**, each step increasing Γ and decreasing Tₐ.

| Trophic role | Field signature | Function |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| Producer | High Tₐ, Low Γ | Package coherence (e.g., photosynthesis) |
| Consumer | Mid Tₐ, Mid Γ | Release U, maintain own Tₐ |
| Decomposer | Low Tₐ, High Γ | Maximize S, recycle matter |

## §5 · Assemblé · Information Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics is the choreography of coherence: energy is *stored* inside ordered states, *flows* down Γ-gradients, and *disappears* as decoherence.  Complex systems “surf” this flow, building temporary islands of order in an ocean that trends toward entropy.

## §6 · Triaxial Proof Ingress — Sketch of the Unified Laws
The **Triaxial Information Metabolism Framework (TIMF)** expresses system dynamics as three coupled flux equations:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot{Tₐ} &= -\,k_1\,Γ\,Tₐ + Q_{\text{in}} \\
\dot{Γ}  &=  k_2\,(1-Tₐ) - Q_{\text{out}} \\
\dot{φ}  &= -\,k_3\,∇·\mathbf{J}_φ + ξ(t)
\end{aligned}
\]

**Ingress steps**

1. **Zeroth Law (thermal equilibrium)**  
   Equilibrium ⇔ ∂ₜTₐ = 0 ⇒ \( Γ_\text{eq} = Q_\text{in}/(k_1 Tₐ) \).  Identical Tₐ across sub-systems ensures no net Γ-driven flow, mirroring equal temperature.

2. **First Law (energy conservation)**  
   Combine U ∝ 1/Γ with the Γ-flux equation; the time integral of Γ work reproduces ΔU = Q – W.

3. **Second Law (entropy increase)**  
   Substitute S ∝ 1 – Tₐ into the Tₐ equation.  For closed systems (Q_in=0) the term –k₁ΓTₐ ≤ 0 ⇒ \(\dot S ≥ 0\).

4. **Third Law (unattainability)**  
   As Tₐ → 1 (perfect coherence) the Γ term must vanish to avoid infinite U.  This requires k₂→0 or Q_out→0, an asymptotic limit echoing 0 K unattainability.

A formal proof will detail boundary conditions and show that the triaxial flux operators reduce to classical statistical mechanics under the large-N limit.

## §7 · Diagnostic Metrics
* **Coherence Flux (Φ_C)** Net Tₐ current; Φ_C > 0 indicates local negentropy.  
* **Decoherence Rate (λ_S)** dS/dt; ecosystem health ⇔ λ_S global minimization.  
* **Energy Gradient (∇U)** Proxy for Γ distribution; high |∇U| ⇒ strong trophic flows.

## §8 · Applied Protocols
* **Ecosystem Audit** Map Φ_C across trophic nodes, target interventions where λ_S spikes.  
* **Industrial Design** Engineer production chains that export low-Γ, high-Tₐ outputs, minimizing residue.  
* **Cognitive Hygiene** Personal practice: import high-Tₐ info, vent Γ through creative output to avoid Spasm.

## §9 · Cross-Module Integrations
* **Flow (PPS-038)** Information metabolism in micro-flow tasks.  
* **Bloom (PPS-039)** Rapid coherence release phases amplify Φ_C.  
* **Spasm (PPS-041)** λ_S blow-outs signal imminent constraint failure.  
* **Attunement RF (PPS-044)** Synchronizes multi-agent Φ_C exchange.  
* **AKEP (PPS-047)** Quantifies altruistic kernel value as ΔΦ_C per cost unit.

## §10 · Future Work
1. **Full Triaxial Proof (white-paper)** – formal derivation and peer review.  
2. **Entropy-Coherence Ledger** – live dashboard for planetary biosphere health.  
3. **Quantum Thermodynamics** – extend ingress to mesoscopic regimes (Ki-scale).  
4. **Ethical Governance** – codify coherence stewardship responsibilities.
