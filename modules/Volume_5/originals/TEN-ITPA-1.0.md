## §1 · Purpose
Given one thermodynamic potential (e.g., Helmholtz free energy F(T,V)), this module recovers its conjugate variables (e.g., Entropy S, Pressure P) and reconstructs all other thermodynamic potentials (Internal Energy U, Enthalpy H, Gibbs Free Energy G).

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: The four primary thermodynamic potentials (U, F, H, G) are fully interconnected via Legendre transforms, representing different 'views' of the same underlying system state, each useful under different constraints (e.g., constant volume vs. constant pressure). Possessing a complete description of one potential in its natural variables is sufficient to derive the entire thermodynamic landscape of the system. This mathematical machinery is analogous to the Information Thermodynamics framework within Pirouette.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Entropy (S)**: Can be metaphorically mapped to measures of disorder or inverse coherence (1 - $T_a$) in information systems.
* **Temperature (T)**: Analogous to Information Temperature ($T_i$) in the Information Thermodynamics module, representing the average 'energy' or agitation of information states.
* **Pressure (P)**: Analogous to Information Pressure ($P_i$), the force exerted by information density and coherence.

* **Data Characteristics**: A well-defined analytical or numerical function for one of the four thermodynamic potentials ($\Phi$) expressed in terms of its natural variables (x,y).
* **And Structure**: A symbolic mathematical expression (e.g., for F(T,V)) or a numerical grid of potential values over its natural variable space.
* **Viable Data Set**: A complete functional form of one potential.
* **Steps**: Ensure the input potential is expressed in its correct natural variables (e.g., U(S,V), F(T,V), H(S,P), G(T,P)).

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Identify Input: Receive the input potential $\Phi(x,y)$ and its `potentialType`.
2. Extract Conjugate Variables: Compute the partial derivatives of $\Phi$ with respect to its natural variables to find the conjugate variables. For example, if given F(T,V), calculate $S = -\partial F/\partial T$ and $P = -\partial F/\partial V$.
3. Verify with Maxwell Relations: As a consistency check, verify that the mixed second partial derivatives are equal, e.g., $\partial^2 F/\partial x\partial y = \partial^2 F/\partial y\partial x$.
4. Reconstruct Potentials: Use the fundamental thermodynamic relations (which are Legendre transforms) to construct the other potentials from the input potential and the newly derived conjugate variables. For example, $U = F + T S$.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: A complete set of analytical expressions for the four potentials (U, F, H, G) and all variables (S, P, T, V).
* **Insights And Derivations**: A holistic thermodynamic description of the system from a single piece of input information. This allows for the calculation of any thermodynamic property and the prediction of system behavior under various constraints.
* **Guidelines**: The output provides a complete picture of the system's energy landscape from multiple perspectives, enabling comprehensive analysis.
