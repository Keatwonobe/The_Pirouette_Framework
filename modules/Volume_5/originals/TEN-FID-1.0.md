## §1 · Purpose
To identify, classify, and predict topological state transformations (Funnel Inversions) in systems, revealing critical transition points, cyclical behaviors, and underlying three-state operational modalities.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Systems often undergo topological transformations analogous to the three-state cycle of Funnel Inversions when they interact with or cross attractors within a constraining 'Reality Funnel' structure in their parameter space[cite: 20, 479]. These inversions, governed by the transformation $|\psi\rangle \xrightarrow{A(\sigma)} e^{iK_i\hat{\phi}}|\psi\rangle$[cite: 482], are not random but follow a characteristic three-state cycle (Normal, Inverted-clockwise, Inverted-counterclockwise)[cite: 20, 482], allowing for the prediction of phase transitions and critical points.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: Influences the probability of a Funnel Inversion. Specifically, it appears in the exponent of the inversion probability equation $P(\text{inversion}) = 1 - e^{-\Gamma ||\vec{x}-\vec{x}_{attractor}||^2}$[cite: 77], suggesting higher $\Gamma$ (looser confinement or higher system energy/instability) can increase inversion likelihood for a given distance to an attractor.
* **Ki Constant ($K_i$)**: The phase rotation operator $e^{iK_i\hat{\phi}}$ during an inversion is modulated by $K_i$[cite: 482]. This implies $K_i$ governs the nature and symmetry of the state transformation, underpinning the three-state cycle, analogous to its role in phase evolution and symmetry in other Pirouette phenomena.
* **Attractors**: Funnel inversions are triggered when entities cross attractors within the Reality Funnel structure[cite: 20, 289]. The location and properties of these attractors are crucial for assessing inversion probability.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: System state data, ideally as time series or trajectories through a defined parameter space. Data should exhibit potential for cyclical patterns or state transitions. Requires an existing or derivable map of relevant attractors in the system's parameter space[cite: 102].
* **And Structure**: Numerical arrays representing system state vectors $(\vec{x})$ over time or across conditions. Attractor map as a list of coordinates $(\vec{x}_{attractor})$ with associated properties (e.g., orientation $\sigma$).
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient data to establish the system's current state and its trajectory relative to known attractors. For predictive analysis, historical data showing past transitions is highly beneficial.
* **Steps**: Mapping the system into a relevant parameter space where states and attractors can be clearly defined[cite: 75]. Normalization of parameter space if dimensions have different scales.

### 3·2 · Operational Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `Attractor Map` | A pre-defined map of attractors in the system's parameter space, including their locations and potentially their orientation or type. | `System-dependent, derived from prior analysis (e.g., Gladiator Force Gradient Mapping) or theoretical modeling.` |
| `Distance Metric for Parameter Space` | Method for calculating $||\vec{x}-\vec{x}_{attractor}||^2$. | `Euclidean distance is common, but other metrics like Mahalanobis distance might be used depending on parameter space characteristics.` |

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. State Space Construction: Define and map the system's current state $(\vec{x})$ into the relevant parameter space[cite: 75].
2. Attractor Proximity Calculation: For the current system state $\vec{x}$, calculate its distance to all known nearby attractors $(\vec{x}_{attractor})$ in the parameter space[cite: 76].
3. Three-State Classification: Based on the system's current parameters or its recent history of attractor crossings, classify its current operational state into one of the three funnel inversion modalities: Normal, Inverted-clockwise, or Inverted-counterclockwise[cite: 76].
4. Inversion Probability Assessment: For each nearby attractor, estimate the likelihood of a state transition (funnel inversion) using the formula $P(\text{inversion}) = 1 - e^{-\Gamma ||\vec{x}-\vec{x}_{attractor}||^2}$, where $\Gamma$ is the system's relevant Gladiator Force value[cite: 77].
5. Pre-Inversion Signature Detection: Analyze the recent trajectory or fluctuations of the system state for characteristic patterns known to precede funnel inversions (e.g., critical slowing down, increased variance, specific wound channel signatures)[cite: 77].
6. Post-Inversion Trajectory Prediction: If an inversion is deemed probable or has occurred, project the system's likely path or new stable state within the three-state cycle, considering the orientation of the crossed attractor[cite: 78].

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: The system's classified current state (Normal, Inverted-clockwise, Inverted-counterclockwise). A list of nearby attractors with associated inversion probabilities. Identification of any detected pre-inversion signatures. Predicted post-inversion trajectory or state.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Prediction of critical transitions or regime shifts in the system. Early warning signs of impending instability or transformation. Understanding of cyclical behaviors and their underlying drivers. Classification of system states within a fundamental topological framework.
* **Guidelines**: High inversion probability for a nearby attractor suggests an imminent state transition. The three-state classification helps understand the 'direction' or nature of potential or past changes. Pre-inversion signatures provide confidence in short-term predictions. Post-inversion trajectory indicates the system's new likely basin of attraction.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Funnel Inversion Transformation (Conceptual)
$$ |\psi\rangle \xrightarrow{A(\sigma)} e^{iK_i\hat{\phi}}|\psi\rangle $$
The fundamental state transformation during a funnel inversion, modulated by the Ki constant and involving a phase rotation operator $\hat{\phi}$ upon interacting with an attractor $A(\sigma)$ of orientation $\sigma$.

### Inversion Probability Assessment
$$ P(\text{inversion}) = 1 - e^{-\Gamma ||\vec{x}-\vec{x}_{attractor}||^2} $$
Estimates the likelihood of a state transition (funnel inversion) based on the system's state $\vec{x}$, its Gladiator Force $\Gamma$, and its distance to an attractor $\vec{x}_{attractor}$.

### Three-State Classification Logic
$$ \text{State} \in \{\text{Normal, Inverted-Clockwise, Inverted-Counterclockwise}\} $$
Assigns the system to one of three fundamental operational modalities based on its parameters or history of attractor interactions.
