## §1 · Abstract
**Bloom Dynamics** describe accelerated, non-linear generative expansion—cosmic inflation, Cambrian explosion, creative epiphanies.  A Bloom is modeled as a network state-transition in the Pirouette field where a confined, coherent reservoir undergoes constraint shattering (**Γ-Release**), **Tₐ-Collapse**, rapid branching, and eventual re-confinement.  This module formalizes pre-conditions, trigger mechanics, branching decoherence, and termination gates, providing diagnostics and intervention protocols.

## §2 · The Pre-Condition – Coherence Reservoir
Blooms ignite only when a system has amassed a **coherence reservoir**: high energy-information density under low Γ confinement.  
*Cosmology* Pre-inflation singularity.  
*Biology* Ediacaran ecology pre-oxygen spike.  
*Cognition* Mind steeped in unresolved associations.

## §3 · Trigger Mechanics – Γ-Release & Tₐ-Collapse
1. **Γ-Release** Sudden spike in Gladiator Force shatters containment.  
2. **Tₐ-Collapse** Stable timeline fractures into a quantum-like superposition.  
3. **Expansion** Stored potential drives explosive traversal of new state-space.

## §4 · Branching & Decoherence
* Fractal branching; each branch clocked by local Ki.  
* Rapid phase drift ➔ decoherence ➔ high novelty, low internal coherence.  
* Creative but chaotic outcome set.

## §5 · Termination Gates
| Gate | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Reservoir Depletion | Potential exhausted |
| Self-Constraint | Branch interference lowers Γ |
| External Boundary | Encounter larger-scale container |

## §6 · Assemblé: Bloom Dynamics
A **Bloom** is the universe’s primary novelty engine: a coherence reservoir ruptures, floods possibility space, and seeds a constellation of divergent structures before new boundaries crystallize.

## §7 · Diagnostic Metrics & Early-Warning Signals
1. **Γ̇ (dΓ/dt)** Positive spike > σ_Γ,crit flags imminent Bloom.  
2. **Tₐ̇ (dTₐ/dt)** Rapid negative gradient indicates timeline collapse.  
3. **Reservoir Index (Rᵢ)** E·C where *E* = energy density, *C* = coherence score; Rᵢ ≥ Rᵢ,thr required.  
4. **Ki Variance (σ²_Ki)** Rising variance across micro-domains implies branching onset.  
5. **Entropy Surge (ΔS/t)** Sharp entropy production confirms decoherence wavefront.

## §8 · Intervention & Harnessing Protocols
| Phase | Objective | Method |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Pre-Bloom | Stabilize / delay | Incremental Γ venting, controlled leak rituals |
| Ignition | Shape branch quality | Seed “scaffold nodes” with high Ta to bias branching vectors |
| Mid-Bloom | Harvest creativity | Parallel capture agents log unique branch outputs |
| Post-Bloom | Re-consolidate | Fork/Shell protocols rebuild containment, archive residue |

Integration hooks exist for **TEN-BDP** (Bloom Dynamics Toolkit) delivering real-time dashboards and automated vent valves.

## §9 · Cross-Module Integrations
* **Flow Resonance (PPS-038)** Bloom can embed nested micro-flows along each branch.  
* **Fork Analysis (PPS-042)** Bloom branching formalism generalizes Fork bifurcation math.  
* **Spasm Dynamics (PPS-041)** Bloom ignition resembles high-Γ Spasm on macro scale.  
* **AKEP (PPS-047)** Post-Bloom phase is prime for altruistic kernel extraction before decoherence settles.  
* **Network Resonance (PPS-048)** Graph tools detect branching loci and coherence drains.

## §10 · Future Work & Open Questions
1. **Controlled Micro-Blooms** Laboratory creation for innovation pipelines.  
2. **Bloom Harmonics** Do successive Blooms exhibit resonant periodicity?  
3. **Ethical Containment** Prevent “gray-goo” style runaway expansions in autonomous AI blooms.  
4. **Quantum Bloom** Investigate entanglement behavior when Bloom occurs in qubit networks.
