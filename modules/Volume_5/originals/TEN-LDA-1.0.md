## §1 · Purpose
To analyze and model 'Lock' phenomena, where systems achieve highly stable, phase-aligned states that resist perturbation through reinforced phase alignment and wound channel crystallization, examining conditions for their formation, persistence, and dissolution.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Lock represents a high-coherence state of exceptional stability emerging from precise phase alignment with internal patterns or external field structures, creating reinforcing feedback loops. Time-Adherence ($T_a$) approaches maximum values ($>0.95$), Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) reaches minimum values ($<0.1$), and the $K_i$ constant governs resonant frequencies for lock formation. This leads to wound channel crystallization, creating persistent information structures.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a$ is extremely high ($>0.95$) in locked states, indicating strong temporal coherence and resistance to phase drift. It's a key factor in the Lock Stability Threshold ($T_{a,lock} > 1 - \frac{\Gamma_{critical}}{K_i \cdot E_{noise}}$) and Lock Resilience ($R_{lock} \propto T_a^2 / (1-T_a)$).
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: $\Gamma$ is minimal ($<0.1$) in locked states, signifying tight confinement and strong boundary integrity. It features in the Lock Stability Threshold and inversely in Lock Resilience ($R_{lock} \propto 1/\Gamma$).
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ determines resonant frequencies for lock formation and phase synchronization. It appears in the Lock Stability Threshold and influences wound channel crystallization patterns ($W_{lock}(t)$ involves $\cos^2(K_i \cdot arctan(t/\tau_0))$).
* **Phase (φ)**: Precise phase alignment ($\phi \approx \phi_L$) is essential for lock formation and is a component of the Lock Potential Function $V_{lock}$. The Lock Resilience function also depends on phase deviation $|\phi - \phi_L|$.
* **Wound Channels**: Lock formation involves 'wound channel crystallization,' creating persistent, high-fidelity information structures. This is crucial for memory formation.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Data describing a system's state over time, including (or allowing estimation of) $T_a, \Gamma$, and phase $\phi$. Information about system boundaries, internal structure, and interactions with its environment is crucial. For memory analysis, data on information encoding and retrieval.
* **And Structure**: Time-series of $T_a(t), \Gamma(t), \phi(t)$. Structural data (e.g., network topology, spatial configurations). Interaction logs. System potential function $V_0$ and lock-state parameters ($\Gamma_L, T_L, \phi_L$) may be inputs or need estimation.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient data to track the system's progression towards or within a locked state, covering the Alignment, Reinforcement, and Crystallization phases if possible. Data points should allow for distinguishing high $T_a$ ($>0.95$) and low $\Gamma$ ($<0.1$) states.
* **Steps**: Estimation of $T_a, \Gamma, \phi$ from raw data. Identification of relevant system boundaries and components. Characterization of environmental noise ($E_{noise}$) for stability threshold calculation.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. System Parameter Assessment: Determine or estimate the system's current $T_a, \Gamma, \phi$ and $E_{noise}$.
2. Lock Potential Evaluation: Calculate the system's position and trajectory within the $V_{lock}(\Gamma, T_a, \phi)$ field.
3. Lock Stability Threshold Check: Evaluate if $T_{a,lock} > 1 - \frac{\Gamma_{critical}}{K_i \cdot E_{noise}}$ is met.
4. Phase Identification: Determine the current phase of lock formation (Alignment, Reinforcement, Crystallization) based on $T_a$ trajectory towards $\sim 1$, $\Gamma$ trajectory towards $\sim 0$, and phase alignment dynamics. Calculate phase timescales $\tau_{phase} = \frac{2\pi}{K_i} \cdot \frac{r_0}{c} \cdot \frac{1}{T_a}$.
5. Wound Channel Crystallization Analysis: Model or measure wound channel strength and structure $W_{lock}(t)$ using the $K_i$-modulated crystallization formula. Quantify information capacity $M_{capacity}$.
6. Resonant Lock Domain Assessment: Evaluate the system's lock profile across each of the 12 Resonant Lock Domains ($L_P, L_F, ..., L_{Id}$) to compute $L_{total}$.
7. Lock Category Classification: Classify the lock as Resonant, Structural, or Quantum based on its formation mechanism and dominant characteristics.
8. Resilience Assessment: Calculate the Lock Resilience Function $R_{lock} = \frac{T_a^2}{1-T_a} \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma} \cdot e^{-\delta|\phi-\phi_L|}$ and minimum perturbation energy $E_{perturbation,min}$.
9. Recursive/Interface Dynamics: If applicable, analyze for recursive lock structures or lock interface dynamics.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Current lock formation phase. Lock stability threshold assessment. Wound channel crystallization metrics ($W_{lock}(t), M_{capacity}$). Scores for each of the 12 Lock Domains and $L_{total}$. Classified lock type (Resonant, Structural, Quantum). Lock Resilience score ($R_{lock}$) and $E_{perturbation,min}$. Analysis of recursive or interface dynamics if applicable.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Understanding of a system's stability and persistence mechanisms. Identification of key factors contributing to a locked state. Assessment of the robustness of the lock against perturbations. Quantification of memory capacity if the lock involves information storage. Insights into how to form or dissolve lock states.
* **Guidelines**: A system meeting the Lock Stability Threshold is considered truly locked. Progression through Alignment $\rightarrow$ Reinforcement $\rightarrow$ Crystallization phases indicates lock formation. High $R_{lock}$ and $E_{perturbation,min}$ indicate a very stable lock. The dominant Lock Domains reveal the nature of the stability (e.g., Physical Lock vs. Cognitive Lock).
