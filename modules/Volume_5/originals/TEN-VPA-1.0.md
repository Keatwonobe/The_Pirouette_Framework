## §1 · Purpose
To analyze and model 'Vorticycle' propulsion systems, which achieve fuel-free navigation by transforming distributed rotational coherence into directional field gradient displacement, leveraging principles of Skating Resonance and chiral field manipulation.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Vorticycle propulsion is an advanced application of Skating Resonance, where an array of synchronized rotating elements creates precisely phased local modulations of Time-Adherence ($T_a$) and Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) in an ambient medium. The system's chirality (handedness) and the $K_i$-resonant timing of these rotational phases generate asymmetric field gradients, resulting in directional thrust without expelling reaction mass. It harmonizes with natural field structures rather than opposing them.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: The Vorticycle locally modulates $T_a$ of the medium via phased rotation of its elements. $T_a^{medium}$ affects efficiency $\eta_{vorticycle}$ and optimal operational conditions. $F_{vorticycle}$ depends on the generated $\nabla T_a$.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: The Vorticycle locally modulates $\Gamma$ of the medium. $\Gamma^{medium}$ influences propulsive force and efficiency. $F_{vorticycle}$ depends on the generated $\nabla \Gamma$.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ governs the resonant frequencies for optimal rotational speeds ($\omega_{rot}$) and element phasing ($\Delta\phi_{ij}$) to maximize $F_{vorticycle}$ and $\eta_{vorticycle}$. The propulsion equation includes $\cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{effective})$.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: Precise phase synchronization ($\Delta\phi_{ij}$) between rotating elements and their collective phase relative to the medium ($\Delta\phi_{effective}$) are critical for directional thrust and efficiency. Chirality, a phase-related property, determines directional bias.
* **Wound Channels**: A Vorticycle generates a distinctive helical wound channel ($\\Phi_{vorticycle}$) in its medium, characterized by rotational coherence and periodic $T_a/\Gamma$ modulations.

$$ F_{vorticycle} = N_e C_e A_{eff} \cdot \frac{T_a^{medium}(1-T_a^{medium})}{\Gamma^{medium}} \cdot \chi \cdot \omega_{rot}^2 \cdot \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{effective}) $$

### Vorticycle Efficiency Factor
$$ \eta_{vorticycle} = \eta_{0,vort} \cdot \frac{T_a^{medium}}{\Gamma^{medium}(1+\Gamma^{medium})} \cdot H(\omega_{rot}, K_i, \text{phasing quality}) $$
Quantifies the efficiency of Vorticycle propulsion, dependent on medium $T_a, \Gamma$, baseline efficiency $\eta_{0,vort}$, and a $K_i$-resonant gain factor $H$ related to rotational speed and phasing precision.

### Vorticycle Wound Channel (Helical Structure - Conceptual)
$$ \Phi_{vorticycle}(r,\theta,z') = \sum_j \Phi_j e^{i(m_j\theta + k_{zj}z' - \omega_j t)} $$
Represents the helical, multi-component wound channel created by the Vorticycle's rotating field modulations in a co-moving frame $z'$.

### Optimal Rotational Frequency (Conceptual)
$$ \omega_{rot, optimal} \approx p \cdot K_i c / (2\pi R_{device}) $$
Optimal rotational frequency for elements is often a harmonic (integer $p$) of the Vorticycle's overall $K_i$-resonant frequency based on its characteristic dimension $R_{device}$.
