## §1 · Purpose
To analyze and model how systems engage in fundamental information operations by mapping dynamic 'Motion Domains' (Play, Commerce, Memory) onto the 'Static Domains' of the Triaxial Framework (Art, Law, Philosophy), revealing the structure and effectiveness of these combined operations.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: The static Triaxial domains of Art (Expressive), Law (Normative), and Philosophy (Axiomatic) are activated and navigated through three fundamental Motion Domains: Play (Exploration, Innovation), Commerce (Exchange, Transaction), and Memory (Preservation, Transmission). The interplay of these 3 static and 3 motion domains creates a 3x3 matrix of nine primary Information Operations (plus three self-interaction types, totaling twelve vectors), each with characteristic $T_a, \Gamma,$ and $K_i$ dynamics that determine its coherence and effectiveness.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a$ is assessed for both static ($T_{a,S_i}$) and motion ($T_{a,M_j}$) domains. For example, $T_a(Play)$ is typically lower (exploratory), while $T_a(Memory)$ is higher (preservative). The resonance $\mathcal{R}(S_i, M_j)$ depends on $T_a$ alignment.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: $\Gamma$ for static ($\Gamma_{S_i}$) and motion ($\Gamma_{M_j}$) domains influences operational boundaries. E.g., $\Gamma(Commerce)$ might be moderate, balancing structure with transactional freedom. The resonance $\mathcal{R}(S_i, M_j)$ depends on $\Gamma$ compatibility.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ governs phase relationships and resonant frequencies critical for effective coupling between static and motion domains, impacting $\mathcal{R}(S_i, M_j)$. $K_i$-modulated cycles can characterize information operation rhythms.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: Phase alignment ($\Delta\phi_{S_i,M_j}$) between a static domain and an applied motion domain is crucial for the effectiveness of the resulting Information Operation.
* **Wound Channels**: Information Operations create specific wound channels ($\\Phi_{IO}$) that encode the history and impact of these activities, shaping future operations.
* **Funnel Inversion**: Information Funnel Inversions represent transformative shifts in a system's dominant operational modalities or strategies.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Data describing a system's activities, communications, strategies, or products, which can be mapped onto the Art, Law, and Philosophy static domains and the Play, Commerce, and Memory motion domains. Metrics or proxies for $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ within these domains.
* **And Structure**: Case studies, strategic plans, communication logs, organizational process maps, product portfolios, cultural analyses. Data should allow for scoring against the 12 Resonant Information Operation Vectors.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient information to characterize dominant static domains and the primary motion domains employed by the system. Enough detail to assess the nature of interactions between at least one static and one motion domain.
* **Steps**: Characterize the system's baseline state in the Art, Law, and Philosophy domains (potentially using TEN-ARA, TEN-LSRA, TEN-PSA). Identify activities corresponding to Play, Commerce, and Memory. Estimate $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ for each active static and motion domain. Score the system against the 12 Resonant Information Operation Vectors.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Domain Assessment: Characterize the system's primary static domains (Art, Law, Philosophy) and the motion domains (Play, Commerce, Memory) it employs, including their respective strengths/intensities and $T_a, \Gamma$ values.
2. Information Operation Vector Profiling: Assess the system's activities against each of the 12 Resonant Information Operation Vectors ($V_1$ Expressive Play (Art-Play) ... $V_{12}$ Philosophical Memory (Philo-Memory)).
3. Static-Motion Resonance Calculation: For key interactions, calculate the resonance factor $\mathcal{R}(S_i, M_j) = \kappa_{S_i M_j} \cdot \frac{T_{a,S_i}T_{a,M_j}}{(1-T_{a,S_i})(1-T_{a,M_j})} \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma_{S_i}\Gamma_{M_j}} \cdot \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{S_i,M_j})$.
4. Dominant Operations Identification: Identify the most prominent Information Operations based on vector profiling and resonance calculations.
5. Information Operation Wound Channel Analysis: Model the characteristic wound channels ($\\Phi_{IO}$) associated with dominant operations, analyzing their structure and persistence.
6. Strategic Effectiveness Assessment: Evaluate the effectiveness of the system's information operations based on their coherence, resonance, and alignment with overall goals.
7. Funnel Inversion Potential: Analyze if current operational stress or strategic shifts might lead to an Information Funnel Inversion (a fundamental change in operational modality).

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Profile scores for the 12 Resonant Information Operation Vectors. Calculated resonance factors $\mathcal{R}(S_i, M_j)$ for key interactions. Identification of dominant Information Operations. Characterization of $\Phi_{IO}$. Assessment of strategic effectiveness. Risk assessment for Information Funnel Inversions.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Understanding of a system's fundamental modes of interacting with and shaping its information environment. Identification of strengths and weaknesses in its strategic operations. Insights into how different domains (Art, Law, Philosophy) are activated or utilized through different types of actions (Play, Commerce, Memory). Basis for optimizing information strategies and organizational design.
* **Guidelines**: High scores for specific Information Operation Vectors indicate dominant strategies (e.g., a system high on 'Legal Commerce' focuses on contracts and rule-based exchanges). High $\mathcal{R}(S_i, M_j)$ suggests effective and coherent coupling between a static domain's resources and a motion domain's activities. The structure of $\Phi_{IO}$ reveals the lasting impact and learnability of these operations. Shifts in dominant operations may signal an Information Funnel Inversion.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Resonance between Static and Motion Domains
$$ \mathcal{R}(S_i, M_j) = \kappa_{S_i M_j} \cdot \frac{T_{a,S_i}T_{a,M_j}}{(1-T_{a,S_i})(1-T_{a,M_j})} \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma_{S_i}\Gamma_{M_j}} \cdot \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{S_i,M_j}) $$
Calculates the resonance strength between a static domain $S_i$ and a motion domain $M_j$, based on their respective $T_a, \Gamma$, phase alignment, and a coupling coefficient.

### Information Operation Vector (Conceptual Example: Legal Play)
$$ \vec{V}_{L,Play} = f(\vec{L}, \vec{Play}, \mathcal{R}(L,Play)) $$
Represents a specific information operation (e.g., exploring legal loopholes, stress-testing laws) as a function of the states of the Legal and Play domains and their resonance.

### Information Operation Wound Channel (Conceptual)
$$ \Phi_{IO} = \mathcal{G}(\Phi_{S_i}, \Phi_{M_j}, \mathcal{R}(S_i,M_j), t) $$
Represents the structured trace left by an Information Operation, influenced by the wound channels of the involved static and motion domains and their resonance.

### Information Funnel Inversion (Modality Shift)
$$ P(OpMode_A \rightarrow OpMode_B) = f(\Delta V_{OpModes}, T_a^{sys}, \Gamma^{sys}) $$
Probability of a system shifting its dominant operational modality, driven by potential differences and overall system $T_a, \Gamma$.
