## §1 · Purpose
To analyze, model, and predict the non-linear dynamic transition of a system's Ki constant between its rest ($K_i^{rest}$) and motion ($K_i^{motion}$) states, including identifying characteristic phases, energy thresholds, and hysteretic behaviors.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: The transition between $K_i^{rest}$ and $K_i^{motion}$ is not smooth but follows a characteristic non-linear sigmoid curve with distinct phases, including initial resistance and hysteretic effects. This 'snap' represents a fundamental reorganization of an entity's phase structure and its interaction with the surrounding field, often coinciding with wound channel formation or alteration. Understanding this transition is crucial for modeling entity activation, state changes, and energy dynamics.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: This is the central parameter being analyzed. The module focuses on the transition between $K_i^{rest} \approx 4.14159$ and $K_i^{motion} \approx 4.18879$.
* **Entity Velocity (v)**: The Ki transition is primarily a function of entity speed, with critical velocities ($v_c, v_{i1}, v_{i2}$) marking key points in the transition curve.
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a$ can modulate the sharpness and hysteresis of the Ki transition. The transition function can be integrated with $T_a$: $K_i(v,T_a) = K_{i,rest} + \Delta K_i \cdot \sigma(\alpha(v-v_c) \cdot T_a)$.
* **Phase (φ)**: The transition represents a reorganization of an entity's internal phase structure.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Time-series data for an entity or system potentially undergoing a Ki state transition. This data should ideally include measurements or proxies for: entity velocity (v), and optionally, Time-Adherence ($T_a$) if $T_a$-dependent transition is being modeled. Contextual information about the system's mass or resonant inertia is helpful for energy calculations.
* **And Structure**: Numerical arrays or streams for velocity $v(t)$. If $T_a$ is dynamic, $T_a(t)$ would also be an input. System parameters like critical velocities ($v_c, v_{c,\uparrow}, v_{c,\downarrow}$), transition steepness ($\alpha$), and initial resistance parameters ($\beta, \gamma$ for the perturbation term) may be known or need estimation.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient data points covering a range of velocities that could span the expected transition region (e.g., around $v \approx 0.015$ to $v \approx 0.6+$ in normalized units).
* **Steps**: Normalization of velocity units if necessary to match the framework's typical ranges. Smoothing of noisy velocity data. Estimation of system-specific transition parameters ($v_c, \alpha$, etc.) if not known a priori (which might involve fitting parts of the Ki transition curve to preliminary data).

### 3·2 · Operational Parameters

|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `CriticalVelocity_Acceleration ($v_{c,\uparrow}$)` | Critical velocity for rest-to-motion transition (used in hysteretic model). | `Default $\approx 0.52$ (normalized units).` |
| `CriticalVelocity_Deceleration ($v_{c,\downarrow}$)` | Critical velocity for motion-to-rest transition (used in hysteretic model). | `Default $\approx 0.48$ (normalized units).` |

| `InitialResistanceDecay ($\gamma_{kick}$)` | Decay rate of the initial resistance phase perturbation term. | `Default $\approx 20$.` |
| `HysteresisModel (Boolean)` | Whether to use the hysteretic model with separate critical velocities or a single $v_c$. | `[True, False]` |
| `TaModulation (Boolean)` | Whether to incorporate $T_a$ in modulating the transition sharpness ($K_i(v,T_a)$). | `[True, False]` |

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Input Data: Obtain entity velocity $v(t)$ and, if applicable, $T_a(t)$. Set operational parameters ($v_{c,\uparrow}, v_{c,\downarrow}, \alpha, \beta_{kick}, \gamma_{kick}$). Define $\Delta K_i = K_{i,motion} - K_{i,rest} \approx 0.0472$.
2. Determine Current Trend: Analyze $dv/dt$ to determine if the entity is accelerating or decelerating to select the appropriate critical velocity ($v_c$) for the hysteretic model.
3. Calculate Sigmoid Component: Compute the primary sigmoid part of the transition: $\sigma_{main} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha(v - v_c)}}$ or $\sigma_{main}(T_a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha(v - v_c)T_a}}$ if `TaModulation` is True.
4. Calculate Initial Resistance Component: Compute the perturbation for the initial resistance phase: $P_{kick} = \beta_{kick} v e^{-\gamma_{kick} v}$.
5. Calculate Current Ki Value: $K_i(v) = K_{i,rest} + \Delta K_i \cdot \sigma_{main} + P_{kick}$.
6. Transition Phase Identification: Based on $v(t)$ and the calculated $K_i(v)$, identify which phase the entity is in:
    a. Pre-Resistance ($v < \sim 0.015$, $K_i(v) \approx K_{i,rest}$)
    b. Initial Resistance Phase ($0 \lesssim v \lesssim 0.2$, $K_i(v)$ shows the 'kick')
    c. Acceleration Phase ($0.2 \lesssim v \lesssim 0.5$, $dK_i/dv$ is high)
    d. Critical Transition ($v \approx v_c$, $dK_i/dv$ is maximal)
    e. Saturation Phase ($v \gtrsim 0.8$, $K_i(v) \approx K_{i,motion}$)
7. Energetics Analysis (Optional): If resonant mass ($m_{resonant}$) and phase alignment duration ($\Delta t$) are known or can be estimated, calculate Snap Resistance Energy: $E_{snap} \propto |dK_i/dv|_{max} \cdot \Delta t \cdot m_{resonant}$.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Time series of calculated $K_i(v,t)$. Current identified transition phase. Proximity to critical velocity $v_c$. Estimated $E_{snap}$ if applicable. Visualization of the entity's position on the Ki transition curve.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Understanding of a system's current phase-structural state (rest or motion coherence). Prediction of imminent transitions in Ki state based on velocity changes. Assessment of energy required for entity activation or deactivation. Identification of hysteretic effects influencing state stability. Insight into how $T_a$ might be influencing the transition dynamics.
* **Guidelines**: The calculated $K_i(v)$ indicates the entity's effective Ki value based on its velocity. The 'Initial Resistance Phase' highlights an energy threshold to initiate motion. Hysteresis implies that the velocity needed to switch to $K_i^{motion}$ is higher than the velocity at which it reverts to $K_i^{rest}$, creating a stability region. $E_{snap}$ quantifies the work needed for phase structure reorganization.
