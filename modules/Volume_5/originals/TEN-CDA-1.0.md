## §1 · Purpose
To formalize and analyze system degradation, phase transitions towards failure, and critical points of irreversibility by applying Pirouette parameters to model how coherent entities lose stability and wound channels dissipate.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Collapse is a rapid, often nonlinear decrease in system coherence and entity integrity, driven by systems crossing critical thresholds in their parameter space, triggering accelerating feedback loops towards lower-coherence states. Time-Adherence ($T_a$) decay, Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) increase, and $K_i$-modulated phase transitions characterize these dynamics, affecting wound channel integrity and manifesting across twelve distinct domains.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a$ decay is a primary indicator of collapse. High $T_a$ during collapse suggests orderly degradation; low $T_a$ indicates chaotic failure. Critical collapse sees $T_a$ drop below 0.3.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: Increasing $\Gamma$ signifies weakening boundaries and dissipation of energy/information. Critical collapse sees $\Gamma$ exceed 0.8.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ determines critical phase transition points in collapse sequences, the rhythm of cascading failures, and resonant patterns in disintegration (e.g., in wound channel dissipation formula $W(t) = W(0) \cdot e^{-t/\tau_{W}} \cdot (1+\alpha~sin^{2}(K_{i}\cdot arctan(\frac{t}{\tau_{0}})))$).
* **Wound Channels**: Collapse involves accelerated wound channel dissipation, a key diagnostic feature.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Time-series data for key system parameters, including (or allowing estimation of) $T_a$ and $\Gamma$. Data on system structure, function, coherence, trust, energy, information flow, economic indicators, social cohesion, cognitive function, temporal ordering, meaning structures, or identity integrity, depending on the domains of interest.
* **And Structure**: Numerical arrays or streams for $T_a(t)$, $\Gamma(t)$, and other domain-specific metrics. Qualitative data may be mapped to the 12 collapse domains. System potential function $V_0$ and critical thresholds ($\Gamma_c, T_c$) may be inputs or need estimation.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient data to establish baseline behavior and track changes in $T_a, \Gamma$, and other relevant metrics over time, especially during periods of stress or degradation.
* **Steps**: Estimation of $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ from raw system data (e.g., using TEN-TAM-1.0, TEN-SPE-1.0). Normalization of domain-specific metrics. Identification of system boundaries and key components.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. System Parameter Monitoring: Track the system's $T_a(t)$ and $\Gamma(t)$ over time.
2. Collapse Potential Evaluation: Calculate the system's position and trajectory within the $V_{collapse}(\Gamma, T_a, \phi)$ field.
3. Phase Identification: Determine the current phase of collapse (Initiation, Acceleration, Terminal) based on $T_a$ decay rate, $\Gamma$ spike, and feedback loop amplification. Calculate characteristic phase timescales $\tau_{phase} = \frac{2\pi}{K_i} \cdot \frac{r_0}{c} \cdot \frac{1}{1-T_a}$.
4. Wound Channel Dissipation Analysis: Model or measure wound channel strength $W(t)$ using the $K_i$-modulated decay formula $W(t)=W(0) \cdot e^{-t/\tau_{W}} \cdot (1+\alpha~sin^{2}(K_{i} \cdot arctan(\frac{t}{\tau_{0}})))$.
5. Resonant Collapse Domain Assessment: Evaluate the system's vulnerability or degradation across each of the 12 Resonant Collapse Domains ($C_S, C_F, ..., C_{Id}$) using domain-specific metrics and weightings ($C_{total} = \sum \omega_i C_i$).
6. Collapse Type Classification: Based on $T_a$ behavior, $\Gamma$ levels, and wound channel status, classify the collapse as Critical, Elastic, or Silent using their respective potential functions and characteristic features.
7. Signature Detection: Calculate the collapse signature strength $S_{collapse} = \frac{1}{12} \sum \frac{d}{dt}|\nabla V_i| \cdot w_i$ to identify precursors.
8. Cascade Risk Assessment (for multi-system contexts): If analyzing interconnected systems, calculate $P(Collapse_j|Collapse_i) = 1 - e^{-\kappa C_{ij}}$.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Current collapse phase. Trajectory in $V_{collapse}$. Wound channel dissipation metrics ($W(t), \tau_W$). Scores for each of the 12 Collapse Domains and $C_{total}$. Classified collapse type (Critical, Elastic, Silent). Collapse signature strength $S_{collapse}$. Cascade probabilities (if applicable).
* **Insights And Derivations**: Early warning of systemic failure. Identification of key vulnerabilities across different collapse domains. Understanding of the speed and nature of degradation. Assessment of reversibility (Elastic vs. Critical). Detection of hidden decay (Silent). Prediction of cascading failures in interconnected systems.
* **Guidelines**: Progression through Initiation $\rightarrow$ Acceleration $\rightarrow$ Terminal phases indicates escalating collapse. High scores in specific Collapse Domains highlight primary areas of failure. A 'Critical' classification implies irreversible transition. High $S_{collapse}$ indicates imminent danger. Significant $P(Collapse_j|Collapse_i)$ warns of contagion.
