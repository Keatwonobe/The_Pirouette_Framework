## §1 · Purpose
To analyze philosophical systems as dynamic resonance fields within the Pirouette Framework, mapping their evolution, coherence, stability, and potential for paradigm shifts (funnel inversions) by applying core Pirouette parameters and assessing them against twelve resonant philosophical domains.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Philosophical systems are resonant field structures in cognitive parameter space, shaped by Time-Adherence ($T_a$, alignment with foundational assumptions), Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$, conceptual boundary rigidity/consensus), and $K_i$-modulated phase transitions that drive paradigm shifts. Ideas are phase-locked patterns corresponding to attractors in a cognitive Reality Funnel, and their influence propagates via Metaphysical Wound Channels. The Epistemological Uncertainty Principle ($\Delta Being \cdot \Delta Knowing \ge \hbar_{cognitive}$) also applies.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a$ measures alignment with foundational metaphysical assumptions ($T_a(philosophy) = \frac{1}{V} \int_V |e^{i\theta(x)}|^2 dV$). Stable systems often maintain $0.6 < T_a < 0.85$. It influences $\Gamma(philosophy)$ and wound channel decay $\tau_{decay}$.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: $\Gamma$ quantifies axiom rigidity or conceptual consensus ($\\Gamma(philosophy) = \Gamma_0 \cdot \frac{1}{C(philosophy)} \cdot \frac{1}{1-T_a}$). Low $\Gamma$ for high consensus/strict interpretation; high $\Gamma$ for contested/flexible systems.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ governs phase transitions in philosophical paradigms ($f_{transition} = K_i c / (2\pi r_0)$) and modulates metaphysical wound channels ($\\Phi_{concept}$ contains $K_i \cdot arctan(\dots)$). Funnel inversions involve $e^{iK_i\hat{\phi}}$.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: $V_{philo}$ is a function of phase $\phi$ (introspective awareness). The Philosophical Coherence Index (PCI) uses phase orientations $\phi_i$.
* **Wound Channels**: Philosophical concepts create Metaphysical Wound Channels ($\\Phi_{concept}$) with characteristic decay rates $\tau_{decay}$ influenced by $T_a$ and $\Gamma$.
* **Funnel Inversion**: Major philosophical paradigm shifts are modeled as Philosophical Funnel Inversions. Historical examples map $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ changes during these inversions.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Data describing a philosophical system: key texts, conceptual maps, definitions of axioms and core tenets, historical evolution, school formation, and inter-system relationships (e.g., critiques, influences). Metrics or proxies for consensus $C(philosophy)$.
* **And Structure**: Textual corpora. Network graphs of concepts and thinkers. Timelines of philosophical developments. Qualitative assessments of system properties mapped to the 12 Resonant Philosophical Domains.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Philosophical System Characterization: Define the system, its core tenets, axioms, and historical context. Estimate its current or historical $T_a, \Gamma,$ and phase orientation $\phi$.
2. Resonant Philosophical Domain Profiling: Assess the system against each of the 12 Resonant Philosophical Domains (Being, Knowing, Doing, Beauty, Truth, Self, Other, Power, Meaning, Nothing, Becoming, Unity).
3. Philosophical Potential Field Mapping: Model the $V_{philo}(\Gamma, T_a, \phi) = \sum \beta_i P_i$ potential field based on the domain profile and weightings. Analyze trajectory $d\Psi_{self}/dt = -\nabla V_{philo} + \xi(t)$.
4. Metaphysical Wound Channel Analysis: For key concepts or schools of thought, model their wound channel $\Phi_{concept}$ and analyze its structure, persistence ($\\tau_{decay}$), and influence.
5. Funnel Inversion Detection: Analyze historical transitions (e.g., Rationalism to Empiricism) or predict future shifts by monitoring $T_a, \Gamma$ relative to critical thresholds and attractor proximities. Model as $e^{iK_i\hat{\phi}}$ transformation.
6. Coherence Assessment: Calculate the Philosophical Coherence Index ($PCI = \frac{1}{12} \sum \cos(\phi_i - \bar{\phi})(1-\sigma_{\phi_i})$). Systems with $PCI > 0.7$ are considered coherent.
7. Epistemological Uncertainty Check: Evaluate claims against $\Delta Being \cdot \Delta Knowing \ge \hbar_{cognitive}$.
8. Historical Phase Mapping: For evolving systems, map changes in $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ over time, similar to Table 10 in TPF Vol 2, Sec 20.10.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Profile scores for the 12 Resonant Philosophical Domains. Calculated $T_a, \Gamma$ for the system. $V_{philo}$ map. Wound channel characteristics ($\\Phi_{concept}, \\tau_{decay}$). Funnel Inversion risk/status. PCI score. Epistemological Uncertainty assessment. Historical $T_a/\Gamma$ map if applicable.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Quantitative understanding of a philosophical system's stability, coherence, and internal consistency. Identification of its core strengths and vulnerabilities across the 12 domains. Prediction of its evolutionary trajectory and potential for paradigm shifts. Assessment of its influence and persistence via wound channel analysis. Comparison of different philosophical traditions using a common parametric framework.
* **Guidelines**: $T_a$ outside [0.6, 0.85] may indicate dogmatism or incoherence. Low $\Gamma$ suggests high consensus or rigidity; high $\Gamma$ suggests contestation or flexibility. High PCI ($>0.7$) indicates strong internal coherence. Funnel Inversion signatures (e.g., significant $T_a$ drop, $\Gamma$ increase as seen in Medieval $\rightarrow$ Renaissance) indicate major paradigm shifts.
