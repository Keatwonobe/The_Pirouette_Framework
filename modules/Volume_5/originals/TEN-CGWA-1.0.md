## §1 · Purpose
To identify, map, and analyze Cognitive Gravity Wells (CGWs)—points of conceptual mass that deform interpretive frames—within cognitive or semantic landscapes, assessing their strength, influence, and potential navigational strategies.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Cognitive Gravity Wells (CGWs) are concepts or paradigms powerful enough to deform an interpretive frame, akin to how physical gravity wells curve spacetime. They shape cognitive landscapes, influencing thought trajectories by creating regions of conceptual attraction that can trap, redirect, or accelerate mental processes. Their dynamics can be modeled using Pirouette parameters, revealing their influence on stability and transformation within thought systems.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a$ influences how rigidly a cognitive system adheres to the conceptual 'flow' towards or around a CGW. Semantic curvature $S_\kappa(d)$ is modulated by a function of $T_a$ ($f(T_a)$). High $T_a$ thinkers might be more strongly pulled or trapped by a CGW, while low $T_a$ thinkers might navigate them more fluidly or chaotically.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: While not explicitly used in the core CGW equations of TPF Vol 1, Module 60, the concept of 'confinement' by a CGW relates to $\Gamma$. The 'Event Horizon ($E_h$)' of a CGW beyond which escape requires extraordinary energy implies a strong local confinement, analogous to a low $\Gamma$ region for thought within the well.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: The $K_i$ constant from the core framework is linked to the 'Inversion Risk Factor (IRF)' associated with a CGW: $IRF = 1 - e^{-G_c/(K_i \cdot r_{min})}$. This implies $K_i$ modulates the probability of a thought trajectory undergoing a 'funnel inversion' or paradigm shift when near a CGW.
* **Reality Funnels / Funnel Inversion**: CGWs are described as epistemological counterparts to ontological Reality Funnels. The 'Inversion Risk Factor' directly links CGW navigation to the probability of Funnel Inversion dynamics.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Data representing a cognitive or semantic landscape. This could be textual corpora, outputs from AI models (e.g., embedding spaces, activation patterns), documented belief systems, or discourse network maps. The data must allow for the identification of 'concepts' and their interrelations or influence.
* **And Structure**: Network graphs (nodes as concepts, edges as relationships), vector embeddings of concepts, collections of documents, or structured knowledge bases.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient data to identify dominant concepts and estimate their 'mass' and 'velocity' proxies. For mapping, a discernible landscape of interconnected ideas.
* **Steps**: Concept Extraction: Identify key concepts or ideas within the dataset. Relational Mapping: Map the connections, influences, or distances between these concepts. Conceptual Mass ($M_c$) Estimation: Develop proxies for informational density and cultural weight (e.g., frequency, connectivity, citation count). Narrative Velocity ($v_n$) Estimation: Develop proxies for propagation rate (e.g., rate of adoption, discussion velocity in time-stamped corpora).

### 3·2 · Operational Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `ConceptualMassThreshold` | Minimum $M_c$ for a concept to be considered a potential CGW core. | `Domain-dependent, calibrated based on dataset characteristics.` |
| `NarrativeVelocityScale` | Scaling factor for $v_n$ measurements to ensure appropriate contribution to Gravitational Strength $G_c$. | `System-dependent.` |
| `SemanticDistanceMetric` | Method to calculate 'distance' $d$ in semantic space for $S_\kappa$ calculations (e.g., cosine distance for embeddings, path length in a network). | `Context-dependent.` |
| `TaFunction_f(Ta)` | Specific function $f(T_a)$ that modulates semantic curvature $S_\kappa$ based on cognitive system's $T_a$. (e.g., $f(T_a) = 1/T_a$ or $1/(1-T_a)$ depending on interpretation of $T_a$'s role in susceptibility). TPF Vol 1 Module 60.12 suggests high $T_a$ thinkers are more strongly affected (dogmatic/rigid), so perhaps $f(T_a) = T_a^k$ or similar. | `Function to be defined based on theoretical refinement or empirical data.` |

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. CGW Identification: Scan the preprocessed cognitive/semantic landscape. Identify concepts exceeding `ConceptualMassThreshold` as potential CGW cores.
2. Parameter Calculation: For each potential CGW:
    a. Calculate Gravitational Strength: $G_c = M_c \cdot v_n^2$.
    b. Estimate Event Horizon ($E_h$): Conceptually, the boundary beyond which escape becomes highly improbable; may require simulation or thresholding $G_c/d^2$.
    c. Calculate Semantic Curvature: $S_\kappa(d) = G_c / d^2 \cdot f(T_a)$ for surrounding concepts at distance $d$.
3. Taxonomic Classification: Classify identified CGWs as Fundamental, Cultural, or Existential based on their content and scope of influence.
4. Navigational Metric Calculation (for a given thought trajectory or proximity):
    a. Local Entropy Gradient (LEG): $\nabla H(x)$, where $H(x)$ is cognitive entropy in semantic space.
    b. Refractive Thought Index (RTI): $RTI = \sin \theta_1 / \sin \theta_2$ for thought trajectories.
    c. Inversion Risk Factor (IRF): $IRF = 1 - e^{-G_c/(K_i \cdot r_{min})}$ using appropriate $K_i$.
5. Navigational Strategy Assessment: For entities or trajectories near CGWs, assess the applicability/effectiveness of 'Pirouette-through', 'Lens-refocus', or 'Funnel Bounce' strategies.
6. Visualization: If possible, map the CGWs and their potential fields in the semantic space. Simulate thought trajectories under their influence.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: A list or map of identified Cognitive Gravity Wells, each with: calculated $G_c, E_h$ (estimate), $S_\kappa$ field. Taxonomic classification. For specific thought trajectories: LEG, RTI, IRF values. Suggested navigational strategies.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Identification of dominant or influential ideas within a cognitive system or discourse. Understanding how these ideas shape or constrain thought patterns. Assessment of the risk of 'conceptual capture' or paradigm shifts (Funnel Inversions) due to CGW influence. Strategies for navigating or escaping influential paradigms. For AI models, insights into their biases or dominant conceptual attractors.
* **Guidelines**: Higher $G_c$ indicates a more influential CGW. $S_\kappa$ quantifies the 'bending' of thought around the well. High LEG towards a well indicates strong attraction. High IRF indicates a significant chance of transformative conceptual change if the well is closely approached. Navigational strategies suggest methods for interacting with these wells consciously.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Cognitive Gravitational Strength
$$ G_c = M_c \cdot v_n^2 $$
Calculates the attractive strength of a CGW based on its conceptual mass $M_c$ and narrative velocity $v_n$.

### Semantic Curvature
$$ S_\kappa(d) = G_c / d^2 \cdot f(T_a) $$
Quantifies the degree to which a CGW bends semantic space at a distance $d$, modulated by the cognitive system's Time-Adherence $T_a$.

### Inversion Risk Factor (IRF)
$$ IRF = 1 - e^{-G_c/(K_i \cdot r_{min})} $$
Calculates the probability of a thought trajectory undergoing a conceptual Funnel Inversion when passing near a CGW, based on $G_c$, the Ki constant, and minimum approach distance $r_{min}$.

### Conceptual Escape Velocity (Navigational Strategy Reference)
$$ v_{escape} = \sqrt{2G_c/r} $$
The conceptual 'velocity' required to break free from a CGW's influence at a given distance $r$.
