## §1 · Purpose
To quantify the rate, characteristics, and underlying Pirouette parameter influences of decay or fading of any systemic property, structure, signal, or information content along specified dimensions (e.g., temporal, spatial, parameter-based).

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Many phenomena within the Pirouette Framework, such as wound channel memory, signal integrity, and structural coherence, exhibit decay over time or across other relevant dimensions. This decay is often not simple but is modulated by core Pirouette parameters like Time-Adherence ($T_a$) and Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$), and may exhibit $K_i$-related oscillatory features, reflecting the system's underlying resonance structure during degradation or fading.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: A key modulator of decay rates. Higher $T_a$ typically leads to slower decay and greater persistence of structures or information (e.g., in the $\tau_W = \tau_0 \cdot \frac{T_a}{1-T_a} \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma}$ formula).
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: Also a key modulator. Higher $\Gamma$ (looser confinement, more porous boundaries) often leads to faster decay or dissipation (e.g., in the $\tau_W$ formula where it's in the denominator).
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: Can introduce oscillatory components or characteristic rhythms into the decay process, especially for complex structures or during the dissipation phase of resonance events (e.g., $W(t)=W(0)\cdot e^{-t/\tau_{W}}\cdot(1+\alpha~sin^{2}(K_{i}\cdot arctan(\frac{t}{\tau_{0}})))$ from Collapse Dynamics).

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Sequential data (e.g., time series $Q(t)$) or spatially/parametrically distributed data ($Q(x)$ or $Q(\vec{p})$) exhibiting a clear decay trend for a specific quantity of interest.
* **And Structure**: Numerical arrays or streams, where one dimension represents the 'progression' (time, space, parameter value) along which decay occurs, and another represents the magnitude of the decaying quantity.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient data points along the decay curve to allow for robust fitting of the chosen decay model and reliable parameter extraction.
* **Steps**: Baseline subtraction if the quantity does not decay to zero. Normalization of the decaying quantity (e.g., to an initial value of 1) or the progression dimension if necessary. Noise filtering if it significantly obscures the decay trend.

### 3·2 · Operational Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `DecayModelSelection` | Choice of the mathematical model to fit the decay (e.g., 'SimpleExponential', 'ExponentialWithKiOscillation', 'PowerLaw', 'Sigmoidal'). | `['SimpleExponential', 'ExponentialWithKiOscillation'] are common Pirouette-derived forms.` |
| `InitialQuantityEstimate (Q₀)` | An estimate of the quantity at the beginning of the decay process, can be fitted or fixed. | `System-dependent.` |
| `BaselineDecayConstant (τ₀)` | A system-specific reference time constant, used if calculating $\tau_W$ from $T_a$ and $\Gamma$. | `System-dependent, often empirically derived.` |

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Data Input & Model Selection: Ingest the decay data $Q(progression)$ and select an appropriate decay model based on theoretical expectations or preliminary data exploration.
2. Parameter Initialization: Provide initial estimates for the decay model parameters if required by the fitting algorithm.
3. Model Fitting: Fit the selected decay model to the input data using a suitable non-linear curve fitting algorithm (e.g., Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian fitting) to extract the decay parameters (e.g., $\tau$, $Q_0$, oscillation amplitude $\alpha$, oscillation characteristic time $\tau_{osc}$ if applicable).
4. Derive Pirouette Decay Constant (Optional): If $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ for the system are known/estimated, and $\tau_0$ is available, calculate the theoretical Pirouette decay time constant $\tau_W = \tau_0 \cdot \frac{T_a}{1-T_a} \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma}$.
5. Calculate Derived Metrics: From the fitted decay constant(s) $\tau$, calculate relevant metrics such as half-life ($t_{1/2} = \tau \ln 2$ for simple exponential).
6. Goodness-of-Fit Assessment: Evaluate how well the chosen model and fitted parameters describe the data (e.g., using R-squared, chi-squared tests, residual analysis).

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Fitted decay model parameters (e.g., characteristic decay time $\tau$ or $\tau_W$, initial quantity $Q_0$, parameters for oscillatory components like $\alpha, K_i, \tau_{osc}$). Derived metrics like half-life. Goodness-of-fit statistics.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Quantification of the persistence or stability of the analyzed quantity. Understanding of the rate of information loss, signal degradation, or structural decay. Predictive capability for future values of the decaying quantity. Insight into how underlying Pirouette parameters ($T_a, \Gamma, K_i$) influence decay dynamics if those models are used.
* **Guidelines**: A smaller $\tau$ (or larger decay rate $1/\tau$) indicates faster decay. Comparison of fitted $\tau$ with a theoretically derived $\tau_W$ can validate assumptions about the system's $T_a$ and $\Gamma$. Presence of significant Ki-modulated oscillations in decay suggests underlying resonant processes influencing dissipation.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Simple Exponential Decay Model
$$ Q(t) = Q_0 e^{-t/\tau} $$
Models a quantity $Q(t)$ decaying from an initial value $Q_0$ with a characteristic decay time $\tau$.

### Pirouette Persistence/Decay Time Constant
$$ \tau_W = \tau_0 \cdot \frac{T_a}{1-T_a} \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma} $$
The characteristic decay time for phenomena like wound channel information content, governed by $T_a$, $\Gamma$, and a baseline constant $\tau_0$[cite: 72, 775, 2230, 1501, 3391].

### Exponential Decay with Ki-Modulated Oscillation
$$ Q(t) = Q_0 e^{-t/\tau_W} (1 + \alpha \sin^2(K_i \arctan(t/\tau_{osc}))) $$
Models decay with an added oscillatory component modulated by $K_i$, where $\alpha$ is oscillation amplitude and $\tau_{osc}$ is a characteristic time for the oscillation phase. (Adapted from Wound Channel Dissipation in Collapse Dynamics [cite: 1615]).

### Half-Life Calculation (for simple exponential)
$$ t_{1/2} = \tau \ln 2 $$
The time taken for the decaying quantity to reduce to half its initial value.
