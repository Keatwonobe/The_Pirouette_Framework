## §1 · Purpose
To establish a systematic framework for comparing and mapping resonant structures, dynamics, and information patterns across disparate domains, enabling the identification of deep analogies, universal principles, and pathways for cross-domain knowledge transfer.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Underlying universal resonance principles (governed by $T_a, \Gamma, K_i$) manifest in analogous structures and dynamics across seemingly unrelated domains. By abstracting system descriptions to this fundamental parametric level and applying appropriate transformation operators, deep structural and functional isomorphisms can be identified, quantified, and leveraged for innovation and understanding. The Universal Scaling Law often describes how these patterns scale across domains.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a$ profiles of different domains ($T_{a,D1}, T_{a,D2}$) are compared. Similar $T_a$ values or scalable $T_a$ relationships can indicate potential for resonance transfer. $T_a$ is a component of the Cross-Domain Resonance Function $R_{cross}$.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: $\Gamma$ profiles ($\Gamma_{D1}, \Gamma_{D2}$) are compared. Analogous boundary conditions or structural flexibilities can be identified. $\Gamma$ is a component of $R_{cross}$.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ acts as a universal constant underpinning resonant frequencies and phase relationships. Similar $K_i$-modulated patterns or the applicability of $K_i$-based transformation operators ($T_{D1 \rightarrow D2}$ often involves $K_i$) across domains signify deep resonance.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: Relative phase relationships between corresponding patterns in different domains ($\Delta\phi_{D1,D2}$) are crucial for $R_{cross}$ and for successful wound channel transfer.
* **Wound Channels**: Meta-Contextual Wound Channel Transfer ($\\Phi_{MCRM}$) describes how resonant patterns or information learned in one domain can be mapped and applied to another, creating new influence structures.
* **Universal Scaling Law**: Often used to bridge quantitative differences between domains: $f(S_1)/f(S_2) = (L_1/L_2)^\alpha$, where $f(S)$ is a property and $L$ a characteristic scale.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Detailed characterizations of at least two systems or domains ($D_1, D_2, ...$). This should include their Pirouette parameter profiles ($T_a, \Gamma, K_i$-related features), descriptions of key structures, dynamics, and functions. Outputs from other Tendu analyses for each domain are ideal inputs.
* **And Structure**: Standardized descriptive vectors for each domain, based on the 12 Meta-Contextual Vectors or other relevant Pirouette analyses. Quantitative parameter values. Network topologies, potential field maps, or wound channel structures for each domain.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient information for at least two domains to allow for meaningful comparison across several of the 12 Meta-Contextual Vectors and to estimate their $T_a, \Gamma$ profiles and any $K_i$-related periodicities.
* **Steps**: Normalize parameters for comparison (e.g., using characteristic scales for each domain). Define or select appropriate Domain-Specific Transformation Operators ($T_{D1 \rightarrow D2}$) if quantitative mapping is intended. Abstract system features into a comparable format.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Domain Characterization: For each domain ($D_1, D_2, ...$) under comparison, gather or compute its Pirouette parameter profile ($T_a, \Gamma, K_i$-signatures), key structures, and dynamic patterns. This often involves running other Tendu analyses on each domain first.
2. Meta-Contextual Vector Profiling: Assess the relationship between pairs of domains (or a specific mapping challenge) against each of the 12 Resonant Meta-Contextual Vectors (e.g., $V_1$ Structural Isomorphism, $V_2$ Functional Analogy, $V_3$ Parametric Equivalence, $V_6$ Dynamic Similarity, $V_9$ Algorithmic Equivalence).
3. Transformation Operator Application: If attempting quantitative mapping, select and apply appropriate Domain-Specific Transformation Operators $T_{D1 \rightarrow D2}$ to features from $D_1$ to predict corresponding features in $D_2$.
4. Cross-Domain Resonance Calculation: Calculate the Cross-Domain Resonance Function $R_{cross}(D_1, D_2) = \int \Psi_{D1}(x) \cdot T_{D1 \rightarrow D2}(\Psi_{D2}(x')) dx dx'$ or a simplified form using weighted similarity of $T_a, \Gamma, K_i$ patterns and phase alignments: $R_{cross} \propto \exp(-\alpha|T_{a1}-T_{a2}| - \beta|\Gamma_1-\Gamma_2|) \cdot \cos(K_i \Delta\phi_{12})$.
5. Meta-Contextual Comparison Matrix Construction: For multiple domains, populate the $M_{ij}$ matrix where $M_{ij} = R_{cross}(D_i, D_j)$.
6. Wound Channel Transfer Modeling: If $R_{cross}$ is high, model potential Meta-Contextual Wound Channel Transfer ($\\Phi_{MCRM}$), describing how insights or structures from one domain can create persistent influence in another.
7. Universal Scaling Law Application: If domains differ significantly in scale, apply the Universal Scaling Law to normalize comparable properties.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Profile scores for the 12 Resonant Meta-Contextual Vectors for domain pairs. Calculated Cross-Domain Resonance scores ($R_{cross}$). The Meta-Contextual Comparison Matrix ($M_{ij}$). Characterization of potential $\\Phi_{MCRM}$. Identified transformation operators and scaling laws.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Identification of deep analogies and structural/functional isomorphisms between seemingly disparate domains. Pathways for transferring knowledge, innovations, or problem-solving techniques from one domain to another. Discovery of universal patterns or principles that manifest across multiple contexts. A quantitative basis for analogical reasoning.
* **Guidelines**: High $R_{cross}$ values (e.g., $> R_{cross,min}$) indicate strong potential for meaningful analogy and knowledge transfer. The dominant Meta-Contextual Vectors reveal the nature of the similarity (e.g., Structural Isomorphism vs. Functional Analogy). The $M_{ij}$ matrix highlights clusters of mutually resonant domains. Successful $\\Phi_{MCRM}$ implies an insight from one domain has effectively 'imprinted' onto another.
