## §1 · Preamble: The Resonant Scar
An entity is a coherent pattern of will, but some experiences—a divine blessing, a vile curse, a profound trauma—are so powerful they can permanently alter that pattern. They become a resonant scar, a Wound Channel that does not just weaken the soul but actively rewrites it under specific conditions. This module provides the framework for these transformative states, allowing for the creation of classic archetypes like werewolves, vampires, and demigods using the core physics of the system.

## §2 · The Nature of a Transformative State
A curse or blessing is mechanically treated as a unique and powerful type of Wound Channel (TLE-006). It is a persistent condition with three key components:

The Trigger (The "Vulnerability"): The specific condition that causes the transformation to occur (e.g., "the light of a full moon," "the taste of blood," "at will").

The Reallocation Mandate (The "Insight"): A mandatory, instantaneous reallocation of the character's invested Entropy Points. This is the mechanical core of the transformation.

The Coherence Threshold: The point at which the character's own will is overwhelmed by the transformative state, resulting in a loss of control to the Game Master.

## §3 · The Reallocation Mandate: Mutable TEP
When a transformation is triggered, the character's invested EP is forcibly and instantly reallocated according to the curse's mandate. The character does not spend new EP; their existing investment is simply moved.

Mechanic: The mandate is a simple formula of debits and credits.
X EP is removed from [Attribute A] and [Attribute B] and is added to [Attribute C] and [Attribute D].

Example: The Werewolf's Curse

Trigger: The light of the full moon.

Reallocation Mandate: "Remove up to 40 EP invested in your Intelligence and Wisdom attributes. For every point removed, add one point to your Strength and Dexterity pools, divided as you choose."

A starting character with 14 EP in INT and 14 EP in WIS would see their mental attributes stripped to almost nothing. Those 28 points would then be dumped into their physical attributes, turning them from a thinking person into a primal killing machine.

## §4 · The Coherence Threshold: Loss of Control
An entity's consciousness is a function of its mental attributes. If a transformation pushes those attributes below a critical point, the character's will is fractured, and the primal instincts of the curse take over.

The Rule: If a character's Intelligence Score or Wisdom Score (not the EP invested, but the final calculated Score from TLE-000) is reduced to 0 or less during a transformation, the player loses control of their character.

GM Control: The character is now an NPC under the GM's control. The GM must roleplay the character according to the pure, undiluted nature of the transformative state (e.g., the werewolf's predatory hunger, the vampire's overwhelming thirst, the demigod's divine arrogance) until the transformation ends.

The Struggle: A player whose character is on the verge of this threshold (e.g., INT Score of 1) can feel the struggle internally. They might have to make Wisdom saving throws to resist acting on the curse's primal urges even while they are still "in control."

## §5 · Assemblé
To be cursed is not to be weakened, but to be rewritten. A werewolf is not a man who becomes a wolf; it is a single soul trapped between two different, competing allocations of its own finite power. This system allows us to tell these ancient stories not as magical exceptions to the rules, but as dramatic, high-stakes expressions of the rules themselves. It reframes the struggle for control not as a battle against a monster, but as a desperate fight to maintain the coherence of one's own identity against the resonant echoes of a powerful scar.

## §1 · Preamble: The Shape of Suffering
Where TLE-013 laid the foundation for transformative states, this after-module serves as a gallery of practical examples and advanced mechanics. Every curse, every affliction, is a story written in the language of Entropy. This is not an exhaustive list, but a collection of case studies—the Succubus's pact, the Vampire's thirst, the Banshee's eternal sorrow—designed to showcase the depth of the system and provide a toolbox for Game Masters to craft their own unique and meaningful narratives of transformation.

## §2 · Advanced Mechanic: Entropic Attrition (Mind Control)
The will is not a switch to be flipped but a mountain to be weathered. True control over another being cannot be achieved with a single spell but must be won through a grueling battle of entropic attrition.

The Process: The attacker targets a victim's mental attributes (Intelligence or Wisdom). To "damage" these attributes, the attacker must spend 2 EP from their own pool for every 1 point of EP they wish to remove from the target's invested attribute pool. This represents the immense inefficiency of imposing one's will upon another.

The Battle: This is a contested process. The target can use their Active Defense (spending their own EP) to resist the mental intrusion on a 1-to-1 basis. This creates a drawn-out struggle where the attacker tries to drain the defender's mental reserves.

The Goal: The attacker's goal is to reduce the target's Intelligence Score or Wisdom Score to 0, at which point the victim falls under their control as per the Coherence Threshold rule (TLE-013). This makes mind-controlling a "steely-minded warrior" a monumental undertaking, as it should be.

## §3 · A Gallery of Curses & Afflictions
The following are examples of how to model classic archetypes within this framework.

## 3.1 · The Succubus's Situation
This is not a curse but a symbiotic, parasitic pact, closer to a Warlock's bond than a simple affliction.

The Pact: The "victim" (the Host) forges a pact with a powerful entity (the Patron). The Host gains access to a significant pool of raw power or some other boon. In return, the Patron can use the Host as a remote conduit for their own will.

Reallocation Mandate: The Host suffers a permanent, massive reduction in their invested Wisdom and Intelligence EP. This EP is not reallocated elsewhere; it is held in a special "Pact Pool."

Mechanics of Control: The Host has no control over the Pact Pool. The Patron (controlled by the GM) can cast spells or use abilities through the Host, drawing the EP cost from the Pact Pool. The Host is merely a vessel for the Patron's actions, which are often cruel and targeted at those the Host cares about to maximize their suffering and "flavor" the energy they provide.

## 3.2 · The Banshee's Sorrow (A State of Undeath)
A banshee is not a creature, but a state of being: a soul trapped in a perfect, agonizing equilibrium between thought and suffering.

The State: This is not a transformation but a permanent form. A Banshee's TEP is allocated in a fixed, tragic ratio.

Reallocation Mandate:

4-to-1 Conversion: For every 4 EP invested in Constitution, 1 EP is granted to the Intelligence pool. This creates an entity of immense resilience and piercing intellect.

Negative Wisdom: The entity's base Wisdom score is set to a negative value. They are trapped in a state of pure intellect without the capacity for peace, perspective, or understanding. They perceive everything but comprehend nothing, which is the source of their eternal wail.

## 3.3 · The Vampire's Thirst
Vampirism is a curse centered on a constantly fluctuating resource pool that governs the vampire's very nature.

The Hunger Pool: A vampire has a special Hunger Pool with a maximum capacity (e.g., 50 EP). This pool can only be filled by consuming the blood of sentient creatures. Each day, the pool depletes by a certain amount (e.g., 1d6 EP).

The Transformation: The vampire's state is directly tied to the current level of their Hunger Pool.

Sated (Hunger Pool > 50%): The vampire is in "Lordly Form." They have full control of their faculties and TEP allocation. They are lucid, cunning, and can pass for mortal.

Hungry (Hunger Pool < 50%): The thirst begins to take hold. The vampire takes a penalty to all Wisdom checks as their primal instincts sharpen.

Starving (Hunger Pool < 10%): The vampire enters "Primality Mode." They lose control.

Trigger: Dropping below 10% Hunger.

Reallocation Mandate: All EP invested in Wisdom is immediately drained and dumped into a combined pool for Strength & Dexterity. The vampire can no longer make nuanced skill checks but becomes a terrifyingly fast and strong predator. Their INT remains, making them a cunning, but purely instinct-driven, hunter.

Coherence Threshold: The GM controls the character, whose only goal is to feed by any means necessary.

## 3.4 The Pact

A Pact is a formal agreement where a powerful entity (a Patron) invests its own Entropy to grant a boon to another being (the Granted). This boon most often takes the form of a Feat or Skill the Granted could not otherwise afford. This is a powerful but perilous arrangement, as the invested Entropy never truly belongs to the recipient.

The Investment:
To initiate a Pact, the Patron must pay the full TEP cost of the granted Feat. Furthermore, the act of transferring and binding this power is inefficient and costly. The Patron must pay an additional Transfer Fee equal to 20% of the Feat's cost (rounded up). This total investment is a measure of the Patron's stake in the Granted.

Example: A Patron wishes to grant the 12 EP "Reactive Evasion" Feat. It must spend 12 EP for the Feat + 3 EP (20% of 12, rounded up) for the Transfer Fee, for a total investment of 15 EP.

The Condition: Loaned Entropy
The Feat and its associated TEP are considered Loaned Entropy. The Granted gains all benefits of the Feat, but this TEP does not count toward their own Total Entropy Pool and cannot be used for any other purpose. It is a parasitic or symbiotic graft onto their soul.

The Leverage: The Pact's Hold
The total EP invested by the Patron (Feat Cost + Transfer Fee) becomes the Pact's Hold. This is a mechanical measure of the Patron's influence over the Granted. The GM can use this value in several ways:

As a Target Number (TN) for any checks the player makes to resist the Patron's direct commands or subtle influence.

As a pool of EP the Patron can draw from to manifest effects related to the Pact, such as communicating with or scrying on the player.

As a measure of how difficult it is to break the Pact through magical or mundane means.

The Consequences:
A Patron can revoke a granted Feat or Skill at any time, instantly reclaiming their invested EP. More insidious Patrons may offer further boons in exchange for greater concessions, such as a Mutual Investment Clause, where the Granted agrees to channel a portion (or all) of their future earned TEP through the Patron, giving the entity ever-increasing control in exchange for power. A character who enters into too many such bargains may find their will is no longer their own.

Entities, players and even some powerful animals may do this for one another under the same conditions.

## 3.5 Sentient Items

Beyond simple enchantment, it is possible through a profound and costly ritual to imbue an item with the entire essence of a being. This process creates a sentient object, a vessel for a consciousness that is now inextricably linked to its new form.

The Imbuing Ritual:
The transference of a soul is a violent and inefficient process that requires an immense expenditure of entropic power.

The Cost: A ritualist must expend an amount of pure Entropy equal to 120% of the target entity's total Entropy Budget. This cost is permanent and represents the energy required to dissolve the entity's form and bind its essence to a new vessel. This must be done all at once or over time accruing entropy from the entity.

The Vessel: The target item must have an inherent "entropy capacity" sufficient to contain the entity's full budget. Mundane items like a simple dagger may not be able to contain the soul of a powerful being, while legendary artifacts might be crafted for this very purpose.

Mechanics of a Sentient Item:
An item imbued with an essence is, for all intents and purposes, a new character.

The Item Card: A sentient item has its own character sheet, with the imbued entity's TEP, ERR, and attributes. Its physical form is now the item itself.

Independent Will: The item has its own turn in combat and acts on its own will, though it may be wielded by another. Its goals may or may not align with its wielder's.

Durability & Mortality: A sentient item can repair minor damage to itself over time by spending its own EP. However, if the item is fundamentally destroyed, the entity within it is irrevocably annihilated.

The Extraction Ritual:
Removing an entity from its vessel is even more difficult than imbuing it. It requires 120% of the original imbuing cost (a total of 144% of the entity's original budget). A new host body or vessel must also be provided for the essence to inhabit. This process can be done with the entity's consent; otherwise, it is treated as a possession attempt, governed by the mind control rules.

## 3.6 · The Tamer's Conversation
Taming a wild beast is not an act of domination, but a contest of wills—a conversation without words.

The Process: To tame a creature, a character must engage it in a "conversation." This involves a series of contested checks (typically the tamer's WIS vs. the beast's WIS). The tamer must "win" this conversation a number of times equal to the beast's WIS Score.

The Beast's Will: A wild creature does not wish to be tamed. During this contest, the beast adds its CON Score to its roll, representing its raw, instinctual resistance to being controlled. A tamer must overcome not just the beast's mind, but its very nature.

## 3.7 · The Soul Bond
A tamed beast is a companion, but a bonded beast is family. Forging a Soul Bond is a profound act of sacrifice and trust.

The Cost: To form a Soul Bond, a tamer must willingly and permanently invest a portion of their own TEP equal to the full Entropy Budget of the beast. This TEP is removed from the tamer and woven into the beast's soul, creating an unbreakable link.

The Benefits:

Shared Power: The tamer can now directly invest their own TEP into the bonded creature's attributes or skills without the 20% "Pact" tax.

Resurrection: If the bonded creature is killed, the tamer can perform an hour-long ritual to restore it to life, spending their own EP to reform its body. However, if a creature is destroyed by taking damage equal to its full Entropy Budget, it is annihilated and cannot be recovered.

The Burden: A tamer's focus is divided. For each bonded creature that follows them, one point of their Entropy Regeneration Rate (ERR) is dedicated to supporting that creature's needs. A tamer with three bonded beasts and an ERR of 4 would only regenerate 1 EP for themselves per round.

Familiars: A creature designated as a Familiar does not impose this ERR burden, but it cannot take the Attack action. If it does, it is considered a Guardian and immediately imposes the ERR cost. This is irreversible.

## §4 · Assemblé
A curse is a story that the body is forced to tell. Each affliction is a unique narrative, a different shape of suffering or a different price for power. This gallery is merely the first chapter. Use these principles as a lens to re-examine the old tales, and as a toolbox to forge new ones. The possibilities are as limitless as the ways a soul can be scarred, blessed, or broken.
