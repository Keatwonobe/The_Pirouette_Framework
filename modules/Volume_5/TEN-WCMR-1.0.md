## §1 · Purpose
To trace information pathways and reconstruct past system states by analyzing persistent 'wound channel' memory signatures left by entities as they evolve through spacetime or parameter space.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Entities (coherent field perturbations) generate structured wakes called Wound Channels as they move through spacetime or parameter space. These channels are not mere passive traces but active information repositories that encode the entity's history, properties, and influence future interactions. Analyzing these persistent patterns allows for the reconstruction of past states and prediction of future evolution.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: Crucial for Wound Channel persistence. The decay time of a wound channel's information content ($\\tau_W$) is directly proportional to $T_a / (1-T_a)$, meaning higher $T_a$ leads to longer-lasting memory signatures.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: Also affects Wound Channel persistence; $\\tau_W$ is inversely proportional to $\\Gamma$. Lower $\\Gamma$ (tighter confinement of the generating entity or the channel itself) contributes to longer memory persistence.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: The phase term $K_i \arctan(\frac{z-vt}{r_0})$ in the Diamond Shock Cone equation indicates that Ki modulates the phase structure within the wound channel, influencing its resonant properties and how information is encoded.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Temporal data or spatiotemporal data containing persistent structures or patterns that can be interpreted as memory signatures. Requires causal information or the ability to infer causal relationships.
* **And Structure**: Time series data, field data (e.g., scalar or vector fields over space and time), event logs, or any sequential data where persistent patterns might indicate influence trails.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient data to identify patterns that persist significantly longer than random fluctuations. Requires data over a duration that allows for the formation and potential decay of wound channels.
* **Steps**: Noise reduction to highlight persistent patterns. Feature extraction to identify potential memory signatures. If analyzing field data, ensure it's on a grid suitable for gradient and singularity detection.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Memory Signature Identification: Scan the information stream to locate persistent patterns, structures, or correlations that maintain their form over time or space, distinguishing them from transient noise.
2. Diamond Shock Cone Analysis: For identified signatures presumed to be wound channels, map their causal structure. If field data is available, this may involve fitting or analyzing with the wound channel field equation: $E_{wound}(r, \phi, z, t) = E_0 \exp(-r^2/w^2(z,t)) \exp(i[kz-\omega t+m\phi + K_i \arctan(\frac{z-vt}{r_0})])$.
3. Topological Feature Extraction: Identify key topological features within the wound channel, such as phase singularities, vortices, resonant cells, or coherent structures. These features often encode critical information about the entity's history.
4. Backward Reconstruction (Inverse Problem): Using the structure and features of the wound channel, work backward to reconstruct the trajectory, state changes, or interaction history of the entity that generated it. This may involve deconvolution or solving inverse propagation models.
5. Information Content Quantification: Calculate the information content $I(W)$ of the identified wound channel using $I(W) = -\int_V \rho(x) \log_2 \rho(x) dV$, where $\rho(x)$ is the normalized information density (e.g., field intensity, pattern probability) within the channel volume $V$.
6. Persistence Analysis: Evaluate the memory decay of the wound channel. If temporal data is available, estimate its persistence using $I(W,t) = I(W,0) \cdot e^{-t/\tau_W}$, potentially fitting for $\tau_W$ or calculating it if $T_a$ and $\\Gamma$ are known.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Reconstructed historical states or trajectories of entities. Mapped Diamond Shock Cone structures. Identified topological features (singularities, cells). Quantified information content $I(W)$ and persistence $\\tau_W$ of wound channels. Predicted future evolution based on wound channel influence.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Understanding of past system states from incomplete current data. Identification of causal relationships and influence networks within complex systems. Analysis of how information propagates and persists. Prediction of how past events, encoded as wound channels, will influence future system behavior.
* **Guidelines**: Strong, persistent wound channels indicate significant past events or influential entities. The structure of the Diamond Shock Cone reveals the causal propagation limits of an entity's influence. High information content $I(W)$ suggests a rich history encoded. Longer $\\tau_W$ means more durable memory and influence.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Wound Channel Field Equation (Diamond Shock Cone)
$$ E_{wound}(r, \phi, z, t) = E_0 \exp(-r^2/w^2(z,t)) \exp(i[kz-\omega t+m\phi + K_i \arctan(\frac{z-vt}{r_0})]) $$
Mathematical form describing the field structure of a wound channel, used for mapping its causal influence.

### Wound Channel Information Content
$$ I(W) = -\int_V \rho(x) \log_2 \rho(x) dV $$
Quantifies the information stored within a wound channel, where $\rho(x)$ is the normalized information density.

### Wound Channel Persistence (Decay Time)
$$ \\tau_W = \\tau_0 \cdot \frac{T_a}{1-T_a} \cdot \frac{1}{\\Gamma} $$
Characteristic decay time for the information content of a wound channel, dependent on Time-Adherence ($T_a$) and Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$).

### Information Decay Law
$$ I(W,t) = I(W,0) \cdot e^{-t/\tau_W} $$
Describes how the information content of a wound channel decays over time.
