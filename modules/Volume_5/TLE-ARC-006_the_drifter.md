Module TLE-ARC-006: The Drifter (Chaos/Skirmisher Archetype)
This document outlines the level-by-level progression of a "Drifter"—a chaos-attuned skirmisher who thrives in the heart of battle's unpredictability. The Drifter doesn't resist the storm; they become it. They invest their Entropy in agility, intuition, and the ability to harness the raw, chaotic energy of "Spasm" and "Fracture" dynamics. They are a whirlwind of motion, an agent of disruption, and a master of surviving the impossible.

Level 20 Summary: Combat Strategy
The Level 20 Drifter is the ultimate skirmisher and agent of chaos. Their strategy revolves around mobility, disruption, and exploiting the unpredictable nature of combat to their advantage.

Unmatched Agility: With a DEX Score of 45 (Mod +11) and the Entropic Stride feat, the Drifter's movement is a blur. They can traverse the battlefield with incredible speed and efficiency, making them almost impossible to pin down.

The Chaos Agent: The Drifter's primary tool is their "Chaos Weaving" pool of 94 EP. They use Controlled Spasm to constantly harass and disrupt the enemy, creating environmental hazards, breaking lines of sight, and forcing opponents into disadvantageous positions. They don't win by dealing damage, but by making it impossible for the enemy to fight effectively.

The Opportunist: The Drifter's capstone ability, Ride the Fracture, defines their playstyle. They are constantly watching for the moment a plan goes wrong. When an ally lands a massive critical hit or an enemy's spell goes awry, the Drifter is there in an instant to capitalize on the chaos, turning a single moment of fortune into a decisive, battle-winning advantage.

Weaknesses: The Drifter's greatest weakness is their fragility. With a mere 7 HP and a low CON, they cannot afford to be hit. Their entire strategy is built around not being where the enemy expects them to be. They are vulnerable to area-of-effect attacks that they can't dodge and to highly perceptive enemies who can predict their unpredictable movements. They are a high-risk, high-reward character who lives on a razor's edge.
