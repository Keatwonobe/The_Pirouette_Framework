## §1 · Purpose
To analyze and model systems (particularly cultural or societal formations) through the integrated lens of Art, Law, and Philosophy as a unified, three-dimensional resonance structure, quantifying their overall coherence, stability, and evolutionary dynamics using the Triaxial Resonance Score (TRS) and twelve resonant vectors.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Art, Law, and Philosophy are posited as three fundamental, orthogonal dimensions of resonant human expression and societal organization. The coherence and stability of a socio-cultural system depend on the balanced and harmonious resonance between these three domains, modeled as interacting vector fields. Time-Adherence ($T_a$) within each domain reflects its internal consistency; Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) its boundary strength or openness; and the $K_i$ constant governs phase relationships and resonant frequencies crucial for inter-domain coherence and holistic paradigm shifts (Triaxial Funnel Inversions).

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a$ is assessed for each of the Art ($T_{a,Art}$), Law ($T_{a,Law}$), and Philosophy ($T_{a,Philo}$) domains, reflecting their internal coherence and stability. An overall system $T_a$ is derived from these. The Triaxial Resonance Score (TRS) includes a $T_a$ component.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: Similarly, $\Gamma_{Art}, \Gamma_{Law}, \Gamma_{Philo}$ quantify the conceptual boundary strength or interpretive openness of each domain. An overall system $\Gamma$ is also considered. TRS includes a $\Gamma$ component.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ governs phase relationships between the three domains, crucial for their resonant interaction and the TRS ($\sum \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{ij})$ term). $K_i$ also modulates Triaxial Funnel Inversions.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: Relative phase alignments ($\Delta\phi_{ij}$) between the Art, Law, and Philosophy domains are critical for calculating $R_{triaxial}$ and TRS. Triaxial Funnel Inversions involve holistic phase shifts.
* **Wound Channels**: Triaxial Wound Channels ($\\Phi_{triaxial}$) represent the integrated historical trace and influence of a system's co-evolving artistic, legal, and philosophical structures.
* **Funnel Inversion**: Triaxial Funnel Inversions represent holistic paradigm shifts affecting all three domains simultaneously, such as the Renaissance.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Data characterizing a system's (e.g., a society, cultural period, organization) artistic expressions, legal frameworks, and dominant philosophical tenets. Metrics or proxies for $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ within each domain. Information for scoring against the 12 Resonant Triaxial Vectors.
* **And Structure**: Qualitative and quantitative assessments for each of the three domains (Art, Law, Philosophy). Historical data for evolutionary analysis. Textual corpora (artistic manifestos, legal codes, philosophical treatises). Surveys or indicators of cultural values and consensus.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient information to characterize the system across a majority of the 12 Triaxial Vectors and to estimate $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ for at least two of the three core domains to assess their interplay.
* **Steps**: Systematically assess and score the system's characteristics against the 12 Resonant Triaxial Vectors. Estimate $T_{a,Art}, T_{a,Law}, T_{a,Philo}$ and $\Gamma_{Art}, \Gamma_{Law}, \Gamma_{Philo}$. Determine relative phase orientations ($\Delta\phi_{ij}$) between the domains if possible.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Domain Characterization: For the system under study, assess and quantify its state within each of the Art, Law, and Philosophy domains, including estimating their respective $S_A, S_L, S_P$ (strengths), $T_{a,A/L/P}$, and $\Gamma_{A/L/P}$.
2. Resonant Triaxial Vector Profiling: Evaluate the system against each of the 12 Resonant Triaxial Vectors (e.g., $V_1$ Expressive Form (Art), $V_5$ Normative Order (Law), $V_9$ Axiomatic Truth (Philosophy), and cross-interaction vectors like $V_4$ Aesthetic Justice (Art-Law)).
3. Triaxial Resonance Calculation: Calculate the overall Triaxial Resonance $R_{triaxial} = \sqrt{S_A^2 + S_L^2 + S_P^2 + 2S_A S_L \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{AL}) + ...}$ incorporating strengths and $K_i$-modulated phase differences.
4. Triaxial Resonance Score (TRS) Calculation: Compute $TRS = w_{Ta} \cdot T_{a,sys} + w_{\Gamma} \cdot (1-\Gamma_{sys}) + w_{\phi} \cdot (\frac{1}{3}\sum \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{ij}))$ where $T_{a,sys}$ and $\Gamma_{sys}$ are aggregated system values.
5. Triaxial Wound Channel Analysis: Model the integrated $\Phi_{triaxial}$ representing the system's historico-cultural resonance structure.
6. Phase Space Geometry Mapping: Visualize the system's position and trajectory in the 3D Art-Law-Philosophy parameter space.
7. Funnel Inversion Potential Assessment: Analyze system parameters ($T_{a,sys}, \Gamma_{sys}$) and historical trends for proximity to critical thresholds indicative of a Triaxial Funnel Inversion.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Scores for $S_A, S_L, S_P$. Values for $T_{a,A/L/P}$ and $\Gamma_{A/L/P}$. Profile scores for the 12 Resonant Triaxial Vectors. Calculated $R_{triaxial}$ and TRS. Characterization of $\Phi_{triaxial}$. Position/trajectory in triaxial phase space. Assessment of Triaxial Funnel Inversion risk.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Holistic understanding of a system's (e.g., society, culture) coherence and stability based on the interplay of its artistic, legal, and philosophical dimensions. Identification of imbalances or dissonances between these domains. Assessment of overall cultural 'health' or 'alignment' (TRS). Prediction of major socio-cultural paradigm shifts.
* **Guidelines**: High $R_{triaxial}$ and TRS ($>0.75$ for optimal) indicate a well-integrated, coherent system. The profile of Triaxial Vectors reveals specific strengths or weaknesses (e.g., strong 'Normative Order' but weak 'Ethical Imagination'). Trajectories in phase space illustrate evolution (e.g., the Renaissance shift detailed in Fig 1, TPF Vol 2, Sec 22.7.1). Proximity to critical $T_a, \Gamma$ thresholds suggests risk of Triaxial Funnel Inversion.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Triaxial Resonance Equation (Simplified)
$$ R_{triaxial} = \sqrt{S_A^2 + S_L^2 + S_P^2 + 2S_A S_L \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{AL}) + 2S_A S_P \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{AP}) + 2S_L S_P \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{LP})} $$
Calculates the overall resonance of the triaxial system based on domain strengths $S_i$ and $K_i$-modulated phase differences $\Delta\phi_{ij}$.

### Triaxial Resonance Score (TRS)
$$ TRS = w_{Ta} \cdot T_{a,sys} + w_{\Gamma} \cdot (1-\Gamma_{sys}) + w_{\phi} \cdot (\frac{1}{3}\sum \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{ij})) $$
A normalized score (0-1) indicating overall system coherence and stability, based on aggregated $T_a$, $\Gamma$, and inter-domain phase coherence.

### Triaxial Wound Channel (Conceptual)
$$ \Phi_{triaxial} = \mathcal{F}(\Phi_{Art}, \Phi_{Law}, \Phi_{Philo}, t) $$
Represents the integrated historical trace and influence structure of the co-evolving artistic, legal, and philosophical domains.

### Triaxial Funnel Inversion (Condition for Shift)
$$ \Delta V_{critical} < \sum E_{fluctuation} $$
Condition where the energy barrier to a new triaxial configuration is overcome by systemic fluctuations, leading to a holistic paradigm shift.
