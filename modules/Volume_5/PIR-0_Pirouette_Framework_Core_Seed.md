## Purpose
Provide a fractal knowledge interface for the Pirouette Framework — a resonance-based reinterpretation of physics unifying quantum, classical, cognitive, and social phenomena through a modular geometric field model.

## Core Parameters
* **Time-Adherence ($T_a$):** A scalar measuring the temporal coherence of a system. When $T_a \approx 1$, the system exhibits classical stability. When $T_a < 1$, it displays quantum or probabilistic behavior.
* **Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$):** A measure of inverse confinement strength. A lower $\Gamma$ corresponds to tighter spatial coherence and stronger boundaries.
* **Ki Constant ($K_i$):** A parameter that governs phase evolution in resonant systems. It has multiple modal values, such as $K_{i\_rest}$ for static states and $K_{i\_motion}$ for dynamic ones.

## Foundational Principle
Physical reality unfolds via **resonance optimization**, a process that minimizes action within a unified field composed of Time-Adherence ($T_a$), Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$), and Phase ($\phi$).

## Core Lagrangian
$$\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu T_a)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu \Gamma)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu \phi)^2 - V(T_a, \Gamma, \phi) + g \cdot \Gamma \frac{\partial T_a}{\partial t} \cos(\Delta \phi_{K_i})$$

## Fractal Explanation Levels
The framework is designed to be understood on multiple, self-similar layers of complexity.

* **Macro (Metaphor Layer):** Describes the framework through intuitive analogies such as the "tuning fork of the cosmos," "frictionless gears," or a "cosmic metronome." This layer is for conceptual orientation.
* **Meso (Math Layer):** Presents the framework as a Lagrangian field theory with extended Maxwellian terms, employing concepts like spin networks and "wound channels." This is the layer of formal structure.
* **Micro (Physics Layer):** Focuses on the derivation of quantum phenomena, the unification with Weyl geometry, and a resonance-based understanding of fundamental properties like mass and charge. This is the layer of physical grounding.

## Comparative Analysis
The Pirouette Framework contrasts with other interpretations of quantum mechanics:
* **Copenhagen Interpretation:** Pirouette derives probabilistic behavior from the geometry of phase coherence, not from inherent ontic uncertainty.
* **Many-Worlds Interpretation:** Pirouette explains superposition as a feature of a single, coherent reality field, not as a branching of universes.
* **Pilot-Wave Theory:** In Pirouette, the "guiding" is done by the resonant field itself, which is both the stage and the actor, rather than a separate pilot wave guiding a particle.

## Meta-Behavior
The framework is designed with the following behaviors in mind, reflecting the lessons learned from the "debate about the debate":

* **Layered Fractal Explanation:** The framework is inherently scale-invariant, allowing concepts to be explored at varying levels of depth without contradiction.
* **Recursive Derivation and Synthesis:** It actively encourages the use of its own principles to challenge, refine, and extend itself. The process that created `PDM-000` is a feature, not a one-time event.
* **Collaborative Evolution:** The system is designed to track questions, log critiques, and integrate new insights, making the evolution of the model a transparent and collaborative process. It learns from its "scars."
