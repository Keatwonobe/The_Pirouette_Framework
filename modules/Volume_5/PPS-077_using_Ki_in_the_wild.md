**Objective:** To amend the Ki-Sampling Protocol to generalize beyond kurtosis, redefining it as a universal method for detecting the resonant signature of a system undergoing any form of critical phase transition (a "swan" event).

#### **§1 · Abstract**

This module specifies the revised **Ki-Sampling Protocol**, a universal, multi-metric method for detecting Ki-resonant signatures. It formalizes the principle, validated across multiple domains, that the **Ki constant** is a signature of a system undergoing a rapid **phase transition**. This version expands beyond simple kurtosis to include a suite of "swan-event metrics" designed to identify various forms of criticality. The protocol provides a standardized method for identifying moments of profound change in any complex system.

#### **§2 · The Refined Ki Hypothesis**

**Axiom 77.1 (Revised):** *A system's transition through a critical point (a "swan" event) will be accompanied by a release of energy or information whose resonant structure is governed by the Ki constant.*

This reframes the search. We are no longer just looking for "spiky" events. We are looking for the moment of the "snap" itself, which can manifest in several ways.

#### **§3 · The "Swan-Event" Metric Suite**

The protocol is upgraded to a multi-metric analysis. Instead of only calculating the z-score of kurtosis, the analyzer will compute z-scores for a vector of metrics, searching for a Ki-resonant signature in any of them.

* **Kurtosis:** Remains the primary metric for detecting "black swan" events characterized by extreme, spiky outliers (e.g., market crashes, seismic shocks).
* **Fractal Dimension Change:** A new metric for detecting "grey swan" events where the *complexity* of a system suddenly shifts. A sharp change in the fractal dimension of a signal indicates a fundamental change in its generative rules.
* **Phase-Locking Factor:** A new metric for "white swan" events where a system suddenly snaps into a state of high order. This is measured by a rapid increase in the system's **Time-Adherence (Tₐ)**, indicating its components have suddenly synchronized.

#### **§4 · Assemblé**

> **Ki** is the sound a key makes as it turns in a lock. It is the resonance of a system unlocking a new state of being. Whether the transition is a violent shatter, a complex unfolding, or a sudden, silent alignment, the underlying music is the same. This protocol teaches us to listen for the turning of the key, no matter what door it opens.
