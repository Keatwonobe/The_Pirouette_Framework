#### **§1 · Abstract**

This module specifies the **Ki-Mode Classification Engine**, the final component of the Universal Ki-Signature Detection Protocol. It serves as the interpretive layer, ingesting the numerical **Triaxial Resonance Fingerprint** (the Ki-Resonance Scores for $T_a$ and $\Gamma$) generated by the `KiSignatureAnalyzer` (`TEN-KID-1.0`). It then applies a set of heuristic rules derived from the Pirouette Framework to classify the system's probable dominant **Ki-Mode**. The output is a human-readable report that provides not just a classification, but a plain-language interpretation of the system's resonant nature.

#### **§2 · Heuristic Classification Logic**

The engine's core is a simple but powerful decision matrix. It classifies the system's dominant mode based on a combination of its narrative coherence rhythm (the $T_a$ score) and its structural coherence rhythm (the $\Gamma$ score).

A score threshold is used to distinguish between "High" and "Low" resonance for each proxy. Based on our initial results, a reasonable starting threshold is **`0.75`**.

| Narrative Rhythm ($T_a$ Score) | Structural Rhythm ($\Gamma$ Score) | Implied System Nature | Probable Dominant Ki-Mode |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High** (> 0.75) | **High** (> 0.75) | Stable, consistent, and well-defined. Preserves a coherent state. | **`Bind`** or **`Rest`** |
| **Low** (≤ 0.75) | **High** (> 0.75) | Made of discrete, well-defined parts with weak narrative connection. | **`Fork`** |
| **High** (> 0.75) | **Low** (≤ 0.75) | Consistent and flowing, but with open and permeable boundaries. | **`Observe`** or **`Motion`** |
| **Low** (≤ 0.75) | **Low** (≤ 0.75) | Chaotic, transitioning, or dissolving its own structure. | **`Release`** |

#### **§3 · Input & Output Specification**

* **Input:** One or more `.csv` files generated by the `TriaxialSemanticSensor_v2.py` script.
* **Output:** A `.md` (Markdown) report file for each input file, providing a complete analysis and classification.
* **Output Report Schema:**
    * **Header:** Analysis Report for: `[Source Filename]`
    * **Triaxial Resonance Fingerprint:** A summary table of the final Ki-Resonance Scores for each proxy.
    * **Probable Dominant Ki-Mode:** The final classification (e.g., `Fork`).
    * **Interpretation:** A brief, plain-language explanation of what this classification means in the context of the system's behavior.

#### **§4 · Script Logic (`KiSignatureClassifier.py`)**

The script will orchestrate the full pipeline:

1.  **Import:** The script will import and utilize the `KiSignatureAnalyzer` class from our previous work.
2.  **Argument Parsing:** It will accept one or more input `.csv` file paths.
3.  **Analysis Loop:** For each input file, it will:
    a.  Instantiate the `KiSignatureAnalyzer`.
    b.  Run the `analyze_csv` method (with `visualize=False` to just get the scores) to obtain the resonance fingerprint for $T_a$, $\Gamma$, and $\dot{\phi}$.
    c.  Apply the heuristic classification logic from §2 to the $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ scores.
    d.  Generate a formatted string containing the final report.
    e.  Save this report to a new file (e.g., `mutual_aid_output_analysis_report.md`).
4.  **Confirmation:** Print a confirmation to the console indicating that the reports have been generated.

#### **§5 · Assemblé**

> A signature is a silent story. A classification gives it a name. This engine listens to the fingerprint of resonance left in the data, and then speaks the name of the spirit it finds there. It is the final translation from the language of the fields into the language of meaning.
