## §1 · Preamble: The Resonant Society
An individual is a single note, but a society is a chord. Great powers—cities, guilds, clandestine orders—are living entities, held together by a shared will and a common resonance. Reputation in this world is not a measure of popularity; it is a physical measure of one's resonant alignment with these powerful social structures. This module provides the rules for navigating this web of factions, where every action sends a vibration that can earn an ally or create an enemy.

## §2 · The Faction Directive
Every significant social group, or Faction, is defined by its Faction Directive. This is a short, clear statement of the faction's core values, goals, and methods. It is the faction's soul, its own Prime Directive, and it is the standard against which all actions are measured.

GM's Tool: The Faction Directive is the GM's primary tool for roleplaying a faction consistently. It is the lens through which the faction sees the world.

Example Faction Directives:

The Archivist's Guild: "Knowledge must be preserved and protected from chaos, at any cost."

The Gilded Hand (Merchant's Guild): "Coherence is capital. A deal is a sacred text. Profit is the measure of a sound will."

The Order of the Unbroken Wall (Knights): "We are the shield. We hold the line. We protect the weak from the coming storm."

The Whisper-Thieves: "Secrets are the only true currency. Every lock has a key, and we are the locksmiths."

## §3 · The Resonance Score (Tracking Reputation)
A character's standing with a faction is measured by their Resonance Score. This is a simple integer scale that tracks their alignment with the faction's Directive.

The Scale:

+8 to +10: Idolized

+4 to +7: Respected

+1 to +3: Friendly

0: Neutral

-1 to -3: Unfriendly

-4 to -7: Distrusted

-8 to -10: Hated

Shifting Resonance: The score is dynamic and changes based on a character's actions.

Resonant Actions: When a character's actions directly support or embody a faction's Directive, their score with that faction increases by 1 (or more for truly legendary acts).

Dissonant Actions: When a character's actions directly undermine or oppose a faction's Directive, their score decreases by 1 (or more for grave betrayals).

## §4 · The Consequences of Reputation
A character's Resonance Score has direct, tangible effects on their interactions with a faction's members and its resources.

| Score Range	| Social & Economic Effects |
| +8 to +10 (Idolized) | Faction members offer aid freely, provide shelter, may give significant discounts or gifts. May grant access to unique quests, titles, or secrets. |
| +4 to +7 (Respected) | Favorable treatment, access to restricted goods or areas, minor discounts are common.
| 0 (Neutral)	Standard interactions. Business is business. No special treatment. |
| -4 to -7 (Distrusted) | Refusal of service is likely. Members are suspicious, may report the character's activities to authorities. |
| -8 to -10 (Hated) | Actively hostile. Faction members may attack on sight. Bounties may be posted for the character's capture or demise. |


## §5 · Abstracting the Web: Intermediaries & Social Stealth
Reputation is a personal, resonant signature. A clever operator knows that if their own signature is dissonant, they can use another that is resonant. This is where your skeevy rogue shines.

The Mechanic: Using an Intermediary Faction
A character can leverage their positive Resonance Score with one faction to bypass their negative score with another.

The Process: The character wishing to act through an intermediary (e.g., a rogue using the Whisper-Thieves to get information from the City Guard they are Hated by) must find a willing contact within the intermediary faction.

The Check: The player makes a social skill check (e.g., Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation). The DC is set by the GM and is based on the hostility of the target faction and the influence of the intermediary faction. Getting the Thieves' Guild to bribe a corrupt guard is easy (low DC). Getting them to assassinate the captain of the guard is nearly impossible (very high DC).

Success: The intermediary acts on the player's behalf. The player gets what they need, and their personal Resonance Score with the target faction is unaffected. The cost is usually a favor or a large sum of EP paid to the intermediary.

Failure: The attempt is exposed. The character's Resonance Score with the target faction drops further. Worse, their score with the intermediary faction may also drop for having brought such risky business to their door.

## §6 · Assemblé
A reputation is the echo of your will, resonating through the web of society. Every choice, every act of kindness or cruelty, sends a vibration that travels the strands, changing how the world perceives your song. A wise adventurer knows that power is not just the strength of their arm, but the number of allies who will sing with them in the dark. A cunning rogue knows that if their own song is out of tune, they can always pay another to sing on their behalf.
