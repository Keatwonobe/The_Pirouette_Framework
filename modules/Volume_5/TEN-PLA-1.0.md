## §1 · Purpose
To analyze and model planning processes as the creation of 'forward wound channels' that project coherence from present actions towards future desired states, assessing plan robustness, adaptability, and probability of success using Pirouette parameters and resonant planning dimensions.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Effective planning is a resonance phenomenon that projects coherent intent into the future, creating a 'forward wound channel' or pathway of influence. The robustness of a plan depends on its internal coherence ($T_a^{plan}$), its adaptability to environmental uncertainties ($\Gamma^{env}$ defining the 'flexibility' of the plan's boundaries), and the rhythmic ($K_i$-modulated) alignment of actions with strategic goals. The Plan Coherence Metric ($C_{plan}$) quantifies its overall resonant integrity.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a^{plan}$ measures the internal coherence and consistency of the plan, including alignment of goals, resources, and actions ($T_a^{plan} = \frac{1}{N} \sum |\langle\Psi_{action,i}|\Psi_{goal}\rangle|^2$). High $T_a^{plan}$ (e.g., >0.8) is desirable for plan integrity.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: $\Gamma^{env}$ reflects environmental uncertainty or resistance that the plan must navigate. $\Gamma^{plan}$ (plan flexibility) should be tuned to $\Gamma^{env}$. $P(success|plan)$ is inversely related to $\Gamma^{env}$. $C_{plan}$ is a function of $\Gamma^{plan}$.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ governs adaptive planning cycles ($	au_{review} = 2\pi / (K_i \cdot \omega_{env})$) and phase alignment in resource deployment. $K_i$-modulated phase coherence contributes to $C_{plan}$.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: $V_{plan}$ is a function of phase alignment $\phi$ between plan components and goals. The Plan Coherence Metric $C_{plan}$ includes a phase coherence term ($\sum \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{jk})$).
* **Wound Channels**: Plans create 'forward wound channels' ($\\Phi_{plan}$) that guide action and shape future possibilities. Their strength ($S_{channel}$) and clarity determine plan effectiveness.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Plan Characterization: Define the plan's scope, goals ($\Psi_{goal}$), and key components. Estimate its overall $T_a^{plan}$ and the relevant $\Gamma^{env}$.
2. Resonant Planning Dimension Profiling: Assess the plan against each of the 12 Resonant Planning Dimensions ($P_1$ Goal Clarity & Coherence ... $P_{12}$ Ethical Alignment & Sustainability).
3. Planning Potential Field Mapping: Model the $V_{plan}(\Gamma, T_a, \phi) = \sum \pi_k P_k$ based on the dimensional profile and strategic weightings. Identify attractor states representing desired outcomes.
4. Plan Coherence Metric Calculation ($C_{plan}$): Compute $C_{plan} = w_{Ta}T_a^{plan} + w_{\Gamma}(1-\Gamma^{plan}) + w_{\phi}(\frac{1}{M}\sum \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{jk}))$ as a measure of the plan's internal resonant integrity.
5. Planning Wound Channel Analysis: Model the forward wound channel $\Phi_{plan}$ created by the plan. Analyze its strength $S_{channel}$, clarity, and potential for guiding action effectively.
6. Adaptive Planning Cycle Assessment: Determine optimal review/adaptation cycle time $\tau_{review} = 2\pi / (K_i \cdot \omega_{env})$ based on $K_i$ and environmental change frequency $\omega_{env}$.
7. Probabilistic Success Function Calculation: Estimate $P(success|plan) = S_0 \cdot C_{plan} \cdot e^{-\lambda \Gamma^{env}}$.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Planning Potential Field
$$ V_{plan}(\Gamma, T_a, \phi) = \sum_{k=1}^{12} \pi_k P_k(\Gamma, T_a, \phi) $$
Defines the potential field guiding plan execution, as a weighted sum of 12 Resonant Planning Dimensions $P_k$.

### Plan Coherence Metric

Quantifies the internal resonant integrity of a plan based on its Time-Adherence, effective flexibility, and inter-component phase coherence. (Note: $\Gamma^{plan}_{eff}$ is conceptualized as how well plan's flexibility matches environment).

### Planning Wound Channel Strength (Conceptual)
$$ S_{channel}(\Phi_{plan}) \propto T_a^{plan} \cdot (1-\Gamma^{env}) \cdot \text{ResourceAlignment} $$
The strength of the forward wound channel projected by the plan, dependent on its coherence, environmental resistance, and allocated resources.

### Probabilistic Success Function
$$ P(success|plan) = S_0 \cdot C_{plan} \cdot e^{-\lambda \Gamma^{env}} $$
Estimates the probability of a plan's success based on a baseline factor $S_0$, its internal coherence $C_{plan}$, and its resilience to environmental adversity $\Gamma^{env}$.

### Adaptive Planning Cycle Time
$$ \tau_{review} = \frac{2\pi}{K_i \cdot \omega_{env}} $$
