## §1 · Purpose
To identify, map, and analyze 'time-disconnection eddies'—regions of high curl in a system's force vector field within Compass Space—and to understand their role in temporal locking, particle binding, and the formation of stable or oscillatory structures.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Particle binding and stability can emerge from localized 'time-disconnection zones' or 'time eddies,' characterized by high curl in the system's force vector field ($\
abla \times \vec{F} \neq 0$) and correspondingly reduced local Time-Adherence ($T_a < 1$). These eddies act as temporal latches, enabling coherent relationships between field configurations that would otherwise be incompatible. 'Locking geometry emerges exactly where time disadherence is highest'. The Ki constant influences the re-coherence timescale and oscillatory patterns (e.g., mesonic pulse return) associated with these eddies.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: Time eddies are regions of reduced $T_a$. The analysis involves mapping $T_a$ and correlating it with curl intensity: $\nabla \times \vec{F} \propto (1 - T_a)$. Local $T_a$ values determine the 'lubricant' and 'latch' behavior for locking.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: The potential field $V(\Gamma, T_a, \phi)$ from which force vectors are derived is defined in Compass Space, which includes $\Gamma$ as an axis. $\Gamma$ influences the critical threshold for eddy-based binding ($\\xi_{critical}$).
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ is the 'intrinsic loop memory for temporal beats', setting the phase re-coherence timescale for phenomena like mesonic pulse return ($T_{pulse} = \frac{2\pi}{K_i} \cdot \frac{r_0}{c}$). It also influences the critical threshold for binding ($\\xi_{critical}$) and mediates resonance phenomena in advanced eddy dynamics.
* **Phase (φ)**: The potential field $V(\Gamma, T_a, \phi)$ is a function of phase $\phi$. Phase shifts can induce mesonic pulse behavior. Gradients in phase ($\nabla\phi$) are part of the advanced time-locking tensor $L_{jk}$.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: A potential field $V(\vec{p})$ defined over a parameter space (typically Compass Space: $\Gamma, T_a, \phi$, or a 2D projection like $\Gamma, T_a$ or x,y if mapping a spatial field). The potential should represent local resonance structures or system energy. Time-series data of field configurations if dynamic eddy behavior (like mesonic pulses) is to be analyzed.
* **And Structure**: Gridded numerical data for the potential field $V$. If analyzing dynamics, a sequence of such grids over time. Vector field data $\vec{F}$ can also be an input if already derived.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient resolution of the potential field grid to allow for accurate numerical calculation of gradients and curls. For dynamic analysis, enough time steps to observe at least one cycle of any oscillatory behavior.
* **Steps**: If starting from a potential field $V$: calculate the force vector field $\vec{F} = -\nabla V$. Ensure the coordinate system (e.g., for Compass Space projection x,y from $\Gamma, T_a$) is clearly defined for curl calculation. If $T_a$ is not an explicit axis of $V$, it must be calculable or estimable for each point to correlate with curl.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Force Field Calculation: From the input potential field $V(\vec{p})$, calculate the force vector field $\vec{F}(\vec{p}) = -\nabla V(\vec{p})$ at each point in the parameter space grid.
2. Curl Field Calculation (Time-Adherence Curl Map): Calculate the curl of the force field, $\nabla \times \vec{F}$, at each grid point. For a 2D projection (e.g., x,y representing $\Gamma, T_a$ or spatial coordinates), this is $\xi_{eddy}(x,y) = \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y}$.
3. Eddy Zone Identification: Identify regions where the magnitude of the curl $|\nabla \times \vec{F}|$ (or $\xi_{eddy}$) exceeds `EddyIntensityThreshold`.
4. Ta Correlation: If $T_a$ is an independent variable or can be calculated locally, correlate high curl regions with low $T_a$ values to verify the relationship $\nabla \times \vec{F} \propto (1 - T_a)$.
5. Locking Geometry Analysis: Examine the structure of force vectors and eddy zones around known or potential binding sites (e.g., baryonic or mesonic structures). Determine if binding occurs where $\xi_{eddy} > \xi_{critical}$.
6. Temporal Pulse Analysis (Dynamic Data): If simulating or observing mesonic structures with induced phase shifts, track the expansion and return of standing waves (mesonic pulse). Measure the pulse period $T_{pulse}$ and compare with the theoretical $T_{pulse} = \frac{2\pi}{K_i} \cdot \frac{r_0}{c}$.
7. Advanced Locking Tensor (Optional): For detailed analysis of specific binding geometries, calculate components of the time-locking tensor $L_{jk} = \int_V (\nabla \times \vec{F})_j (\nabla\phi)_k dV$.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: A map of curl intensities ($|\nabla \times \vec{F}|$) across the parameter space (the 'Time-Adherence Curl Map' or 'Time Lock Map'). Identified time eddy zones. Correlation metrics between curl intensity and local $T_a$. Assessment of binding conditions based on $\xi_{critical}$. For dynamic analyses, characteristics of mesonic pulses (period, amplitude).
* **Insights And Derivations**: Identification of regions of localized time-disconnection which act as 'temporal latches' for particle binding. Understanding of how baryonic and mesonic structures achieve stability through these time eddies rather than purely spatial forces. A mechanism for 'turning off time' locally to enable wavefunction overlap and resonance. Explanation for oscillatory behaviors in systems like mesons.
* **Guidelines**: High curl magnitudes indicate significant local time-disconnection (low $T_a$) and potential for temporal locking. If eddy intensity $\xi_{eddy}$ exceeds the critical binding threshold $\xi_{critical}$ in regions relevant to composite particle structure, it supports the time-eddy binding hypothesis. Mesonic pulse periods matching $K_i$-derived values validate $K_i$'s role as a temporal loop memory constant.
