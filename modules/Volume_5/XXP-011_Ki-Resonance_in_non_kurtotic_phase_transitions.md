**Objective:** To falsify or validate the broader hypothesis that Ki is a signature of all critical transitions, not just high-kurtosis events, by searching for a Ki-resonant signature in a well-understood physical system that does not exhibit high kurtosis during its phase change.

#### **§1 · Hypothesis**

The transition from laminar to turbulent flow in a fluid is a classic, well-defined phase transition. It is characterized by a rapid increase in complexity (a "grey swan" event), but not necessarily by extreme, high-kurtosis spikes. If the refined Ki hypothesis is correct, we should find a Ki-resonant signature in the data precisely at the point of this transition.

#### **§2 · Experimental Protocol**

1.  **Select System:** Use a standard fluid dynamics setup, such as a wind tunnel or a water channel, where the flow velocity can be precisely controlled to induce the transition from laminar to turbulent flow.
2.  **Data Acquisition:** Place high-frequency pressure or velocity sensors within the flow. Slowly increase the flow's Reynolds number by increasing the velocity. Continuously record the sensor data as the flow passes through the transition point.
3.  **Analysis:**
    * Apply the new, multi-metric **Ki-Sampling Protocol (`PPS-077 v2.0`)** to the time-series data from the sensors.
    * Instead of focusing on kurtosis, the primary metric for this experiment will be the **z-score of the change in Fractal Dimension**.
4.  **Prediction:** The protocol should detect a statistically significant Ki-resonant signature (a z-score matching Ki) in the fractal dimension metric at the precise moment the flow transitions from smooth (laminar) to chaotic (turbulent).

#### **§3 · Expected Outcome & Falsification**

* **Successful Validation:** The detection of a Ki-resonant signature in a non-kurtotic phase transition would provide powerful evidence that Ki is a universal constant of criticality, dramatically strengthening the entire framework.
* **Falsification:** If no Ki-resonant signature is found across multiple, well-controlled experiments, it would suggest that the link between Ki and criticality is limited to specific types of "spiky" events, forcing a significant revision of the framework's claims to universality.
