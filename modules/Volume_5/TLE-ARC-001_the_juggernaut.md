Module TLE-ARC-001: The Juggernaut (Warrior Archetype)
This document outlines the level-by-level progression of a "Juggernaut"—a warrior archetype focused on pure physical dominance. The Juggernaut invests nearly all of its Entropy into its body and physical attributes, becoming a titan on the battlefield at the cost of mental and social acuity.

Level 20 Summary: Combat Strategy
The Level 20 Juggernaut is the ultimate physical combatant. Their strategy is one of overwhelming, decisive force.

The Alpha Strike: The Juggernaut's primary tactic is to end a fight before it truly begins. Their Right Arm has a Size Entropy pool of 120 EP. They can channel this entire pool into a single, devastating attack. Combined with their +10 STR Modifier, they can deliver a blow of unimaginable power. This single attack is often enough to obliterate all but the most powerful foes.

Sustained Carnage: A high CON Score of 22 gives the Juggernaut a massive Entropy Regeneration Rate (ERR). Even after delivering their alpha strike, they can quickly regenerate the EP needed for subsequent powerful attacks, allowing them to maintain pressure on the battlefield.

Unyielding Resilience: With 110 HP, the Juggernaut is incredibly durable. Their heavily invested Torso and limbs make them a fortress of flesh and bone, able to withstand blows that would fell lesser beings.

Weaknesses: The Juggernaut's singular focus is also its greatest weakness. With 0 EP invested in Intelligence and Wisdom, they have no modifiers for perception, social skills, or magical resistance. They are highly vulnerable to mind control, deception, and magical effects that target their will. Their path to victory is a straight line; they must close with the enemy and destroy them before their own vulnerabilities can be exploited.
