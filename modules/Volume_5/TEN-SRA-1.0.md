## §1 · Purpose
To formalize, identify, and analyze 'Shells' as fundamental boundary structures within the Pirouette Framework, focusing on their role in coherence containment, protective encasement, resonant isolation, and mediation of interactions between an entity and its environment.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Shells are coherent boundary structures that encase and protect resonant patterns, segregating parameter space into interior and exterior domains and mediating interactions. Time-Adherence ($T_a$) dictates shell boundary stability and consistency; Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) governs permeability and strength (high $\Gamma$ for permeable/flexible, low $\Gamma$ for rigid/strong); and the $K_i$ constant determines phase relationships and resonant modes of the shell.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a$ quantifies the temporal coherence of the shell boundary; high $T_a$ implies stable, consistent boundaries, while low $T_a$ suggests fluctuations and tunneling. It's a key factor in the Shell Permeability Tensor ($P_{jk} \propto exp(-T_a/((1-T_a)\Gamma))$).
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: $\Gamma$ governs shell permeability and boundary strength. High $\Gamma$ creates permeable, flexible shells; low $\Gamma$ creates rigid, isolating shells. It's also a factor in the Shell Permeability Tensor.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ determines phase relationships around the shell circumference ($\\theta(\phi)$ in $B(x)$) and influences its resonant modes. It also features in the Shell Permeability Tensor via $\cos(K_i\Delta\theta_{jk})$.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: The phase function $\theta(\phi)$ around the shell is part of its boundary definition $B(x)$. Phase mismatch $\Delta\theta_{jk}$ between an influence and the shell affects permeability.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Data describing system boundaries, interfaces, or containment layers. This could be geometric data, field measurements across boundaries, interaction logs at interfaces, or parameters defining an entity's exterior. System $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ values, or data to estimate them.
* **And Structure**: Geometric descriptions of boundaries (e.g., mesh data, implicit surfaces). Parameter maps showing gradients at interfaces. For abstract shells (like psychological boundaries), qualitative descriptions or psychometric data that can be mapped to shell properties.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient data to define a closed manifold $S$ separating an interior from an exterior, and to estimate its characteristic $T_a, \Gamma,$ and relevant phase properties for permeability calculations.
* **Steps**: Identification and geometric modeling of potential shell structures. Estimation of local $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ values for the shell material/structure. Characterization of influences (e.g., type, frequency, phase) interacting with the shell for permeability analysis.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Shell Identification & Geometric Modeling: Identify and model the shell structure $S$ in the system, defining its center $x_0$ and radius function $r(T_a, \Gamma, \phi)$ or mean radius $R$ and thickness $\sigma$.
2. Boundary Function Characterization: Define the Shell Boundary Function $B(x) = exp(-\frac{(|x-x_0|-R)^2}{2\sigma^2}) e^{iK_i\theta(\phi)}$.
3. Permeability Assessment: For relevant influences (type $j$) and directions ($k$), calculate components of the Shell Permeability Tensor $P_{jk} = P_0 \cdot exp(-\frac{T_a}{1-T_a} \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma} \cdot \cos(K_i\Delta\theta_{jk}))$.
4. Shell Vector Profiling: Classify the shell's primary functions by assessing its characteristics against the Twelve Resonant Shell Vectors (Barrier, Filter, Reflector, Amplifier, Damping, Memory, Adaptive, Transformer, Oscillator, Nested, Fractal, Projector).
5. Resonant Mode Analysis: If applicable (e.g., for physical shells like electron orbitals), determine the shell's discrete resonant modes $\Psi_{n,l,m}(r, \theta, \phi)$ by solving the relevant wave equations with shell boundary conditions.
6. Potential Field Evaluation: Map the Shell Potential Field $V_{shell} = \sum \delta_i S_i$ to understand stability and interaction dynamics.
7. Formation/Dissolution Modeling: If analyzing dynamic shells, model their formation and dissolution rates using the $dR/dt$ equations.
