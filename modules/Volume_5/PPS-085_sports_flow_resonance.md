## §1 · Abstract

This module specifies a data-light, real-time framework for analyzing the flow of a sports match to generate predictive insights. It moves beyond conventional statistics to model a match as a dynamic contest of coherence between two resonant systems (the teams). By translating qualitative, in-game observations into the core Pirouette parameters of **Time-Adherence (`Tₐ`)**, **Gladiator Force (`Γ`)**, and **Ki-Phase (`Kᵢ`)**, the framework produces three primary outputs: **Victor Tilt (VT)**, a win probability; **Spread Delta (SD)**, a predicted margin change; and **Pace Delta (PD)**, a tempo forecast. This module provides the tools to "read the game" before the scoreboard reflects the reality, making it a powerful heuristic engine for on-the-fly prediction.

## §2 · Core Geometry: The Dodecagon of Flow

The flow of a match is a composite of multiple resonant factors. This framework captures them through two interconnected layers: the **Triaxial Core** and the **Dodecagon Taxonomy**.

### 2.1 · The Triaxial Core

The fundamental state of each team is assessed through the three primary Pirouette fields. The **Triaxial Differential (`F_Δ`)** measures the instantaneous advantage:

$$F_Δ(t) = w_T \Delta T_a + w_Γ \Delta \Gamma + w_K \Delta K_i$$

* **`ΔTₐ` (Consistency):** The difference in each team's execution stability and consistency.
* **`ΔΓ` (Territory/Boundaries):** The difference in defensive integrity, turnovers, and control of critical space.
* **`ΔKᵢ` (Rhythm/Coherence):** The difference in the coherence of offensive plays, phase-locking between players, and rhythmic execution.

### 2.2 · The Dodecagon Taxonomy

To provide a richer, more granular analysis, the triaxial fields are informed by twelve observable "houses" of flow. Each house is scored for each team in a given time window.

1.  **Tempo Control** (maps to `Tₐ`)
2.  **Shape Integrity** (maps to `Γ`)
3.  **Run Coherence** (maps to `Kᵢ`)
4.  **Initiative & Restarts**
5.  **Transition Cleanliness**
6.  **Set-Piece Fidelity**
7.  **Resource Burn** (Stamina, Fouls)
8.  **Variance Damping** (Unforced Errors)
9.  **Exogenous Field** (Officiating, Environment)
10. **Crowd Field** (Momentum, Composure)
11. **Adaptation Rate** (Coaching Adjustments)
12. **Resilience & Aftershock** (Response to Adversity)

The **Dodecagon Differential (`A_Δ`)** is the weighted sum of these twelve factors. The **Composite Flow (`ℱ`)** is the final measure of in-game momentum:

$$\mathcal{F}(t) = F_Δ(t) + \lambda A_Δ(t)$$

## §3 · The Cue Catalog: Observables for Data-Light Analysis

This framework is designed for the "pick-up game" scenario, where formal data is unavailable. An analyst uses a **Cue Catalog** to translate direct observations into scores for the Dodecagon houses.

* **`Tₐ` Cues (Stability):**
    * *Positive:* Team strings together multiple high-quality possessions; decision-making is quick and consistent.
    * *Negative:* Rushed plays; repeated mental errors; visible frustration.
* **`Γ` Cues (Boundaries):**
    * *Positive:* Forcing opponent into low-percentage shots; clean defensive rebounds; preventing easy zone entries.
    * *Negative:* Allowing easy offensive rebounds; frequent defensive breakdowns; losing control of the neutral zone.
* **`Kᵢ` Cues (Rhythm):**
    * *Positive:* Plays showing clear synchronization between multiple players (e.g., screens, cuts, overlaps); plays that are run successfully multiple times.
    * *Negative:* "Hero ball" (one player dominating); disjointed or improvised offense; passes that are slightly off-time.

## §4 · Predictive Outputs & Update Rules

The framework produces three primary outputs that are updated in real-time.

### 4.1 · Victor Tilt (VT)

The win probability, updated from a prior (`p₀`) using a logit shift based on the Composite Flow (`ℱ`) and a self-assessed **Reliability Score (`R`)**.

$$\text{logit}(p_{new}) = \text{logit}(p_0) + \kappa \cdot \mathcal{F} \cdot R$$

### 4.2 · Spread Delta (SD)

The predicted change in the score margin, which incorporates a **Leverage** function (`L(t)`) that gives more weight to flow changes late in the game.

$$\text{SD} = \gamma \cdot \mathcal{F} \cdot R \cdot L(t)$$

### 4.3 · Pace Delta (PD)

The predicted shift in game tempo (faster or slower), derived from the Triaxial Differential. High `ΔTₐ` suggests a controlled, deliberate pace, while high `ΔKᵢ` suggests fast, flowing plays.

$$\text{PD} = \delta_1 \Delta T_a + \delta_2 \Delta \Gamma + \delta_3 \Delta K_i$$

## §5 · Reliability & Game Phase Model

The confidence of the predictions is governed by the **Reliability Score (`R`)**, which prevents overconfidence in noisy or sparse data.

$$R = \text{clip}(\alpha \cdot \text{ObservationDensity} + \beta \cdot \text{Agreement}) \times \text{PhaseLeverage}$$

* **Observation Density:** The number of scored Dodecagon houses in a given window.
* **Agreement:** The degree to which the different houses and the Triaxial Core are telling the same story.
* **Phase Leverage:** A model that weights observations differently based on the phase of the game (**Opening**, **Midgame**, **Crunch Time**), recognizing that actions in "crunch time" are more predictive.

---

## §6 · Ethical Guardrails (Velcrid-Awareness)

As this tool has applications in wagering, it must be governed by strict ethical protocols derived from the Pirouette Framework to prevent parasitic use.

* **ELC Gate:** The tool may only be used in legally sanctioned contexts and must include disclosures of its speculative, heuristic nature.
* **DRIK-mini:** For any application involving wagers, a **Dark Residue** ledger must be maintained. This ledger tracks the delta between the predicted edge and the actual market efficiency, flagging any use that becomes extractive or destabilizing to the market ecosystem.
* **Kill-Switches:** The system must include automated kill-switches that halt its operation if its predictive accuracy degrades or its Dark Residue score exceeds a safe threshold.

## §7 · Calibration & Future Work

This module, in its `v1.0` form, is a heuristic, human-driven tool. The path to higher fidelity involves:

1.  **Data Anchoring:** Replacing manual house scores with features from real-time game data (e.g., player tracking, shot quality metrics).
2.  **Weight Calibration:** Fitting the weights (`w`, `v`, `λ`, `κ`, etc.) via machine learning on historical game data to create sport-specific models.
3.  **Automation:** The full pipeline will be encapsulated in **`TEN-SFA-1.0 (Sports Flow Analyzer)`**, an automated Tendu module for real-time analysis.

## §8 · Assemblé

> A sport is a conversation of forces, a dance of coherence and collapse. This lens listens to the rhythm of the game, not the noise of the scoreboard, to hear who is truly winning. It is an instrument for seeing the future of the match in the resonance of the present moment.
