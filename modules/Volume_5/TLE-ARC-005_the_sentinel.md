Module TLE-ARC-005: The Sentinel (Defender/Guardian Archetype)
This document outlines the level-by-level progression of a "Sentinel"—a defensive paragon who embodies the principle of the unbreakable shield. The Sentinel invests their Entropy into creating a form of supreme resilience, learning to generate and reinforce "Shells" of coherence to protect themselves and their allies. They are the immovable object, the eye of the storm, and the guardian at the gate.

Level 20 Summary: Combat Strategy
The Level 20 Sentinel is the ultimate battlefield controller and protector. Their strategy is to become the anchor around which their party operates, an unbreakable fortress that dictates the flow of battle.

The Unbreakable Wall: With a massive 91 HP and a CON Score of 35, the Sentinel is a titan of resilience. Their high Entropy Regeneration Rate (ERR) allows them to constantly replenish the EP needed for their defensive abilities. They are designed to absorb incredible amounts of punishment and keep fighting.

Master of Control: The Sentinel's power lies in denying the enemy their objectives. Using Interposing Shell, they can redirect critical attacks away from fragile allies. With Resonant Barricade, they can reshape the battlefield, creating chokepoints and protecting key positions.

The Final Bastion: The Sentinel's capstone ability, Aegis of Coherence, is a game-changer. It can be used to provide a moment of absolute safety for the party to regroup and heal, to protect a vital objective, or to trap a powerful enemy in a cage of pure will.

Weaknesses: The Sentinel's immense defensive power comes at the cost of mobility and offensive output. With a low DEX, they are often the last to act in a turn. Their attacks, while respectable due to a high STR, lack the overwhelming force of a Juggernaut. Their greatest challenge is against highly mobile enemies who can bypass their control zones or enemies who can win through attrition, as the Sentinel's primary role is to outlast, not to out-damage.
