## §1 · Introduction
The investigation into neutrino mass and oscillation within the Pirouette Framework began as a search for a single, precise set of fundamental constants. The objective was to derive the experimentally observed mass splittings from a deeper, causal principle. While this search was successful, it led to a far more profound discovery: the constants are not fixed. Instead, they exist as a continuous surface of valid solutions—a "prime resonance manifold." This module documents the formulation of the law that governs this manifold and the hypothesis that neutrinos exist as different "knots" upon its surface.

## §2 · The Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law
The foundation of this discovery is the Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law, which posits that the absolute mass of each neutrino mass eigenstate (m_i) is not an intrinsic property, but an emergent one, governed by a geometric relationship between a base mass scale and the state's structural properties.

The Law:
$$ m_i = \mu_\nu; \left(\frac{\mathrm{PR}_i}{3}\right)^{p}; \left(\mathrm{Purity}_i\right)^{q} $$

Where:

μ_ν (Base Mass Scale): A fundamental mass parameter for the neutrino sector, representing the baseline energy scale.

p (Participation Exponent): A dimensionless exponent governing how a state's mass is scaled by its "Participation Ratio" (PR).

q (Purity Exponent): A dimensionless exponent governing how a state's mass is scaled by its "Purity."

Purity_i = max_α |U_{αi}|^2: Measures how strongly a mass state i is aligned with a single flavor state α. A "pure" state is dominated by one flavor.

PR_i = (∑_α |U_{αi}|^4)^-1: The Participation Ratio, a measure of how many flavor states a given mass state "participates" in. It is a measure of a state's "mixedness."

This law proposes that a neutrino's mass is a direct consequence of its internal geometry, as described by the mixing matrix U.

## §3 · The Knot Hypothesis
Initial analysis using the Neutrino Oscillation Lab revealed that specific values for (μ_ν,p,q) could perfectly reproduce the experimentally measured mass-squared differences. However, further exploration revealed this was not a unique solution. An infinite number of such configurations—or "knots"—were found to exist.

This led to the Knot Hypothesis:

The fundamental parameters (μ_ν,p,q) are not universal constants. Instead, they define a continuous, two-dimensional surface within their three-dimensional parameter space. Any point on this surface represents a valid, self-consistent physical reality. A neutrino is not defined by a single set of parameters, but by a "knot" configuration that lies somewhere on this prime resonance manifold.

The discovery of this manifold implies a previously unseen degree of freedom in the universe. It suggests that the laws of physics are not just a set of rigid numbers, but a set of relationships that allow for a certain geometric "suppleness."

## §4 · Mapping the Manifold & Predictions
Using the Manifold Explorer tool, the shape of this solution space was mapped. The analysis confirmed the Knot Hypothesis, revealing a thin, slightly curved "sheet" of solutions. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the manifold showed that two principal axes accounted for over 98% of the data's variance, confirming its two-dimensional nature.

This discovery leads to new, falsifiable predictions:

The Manifold Equation: The primary prediction is the existence and specific shape of the manifold itself. The relationship between the three parameters is not arbitrary and should be describable by a predictive mathematical function. Future, more precise measurements of the oscillation parameters will either further constrain the shape of this manifold or, if they are inconsistent with any point on its surface, falsify the law.

Environmental Knot Variation: It is predicted that neutrinos produced in different physical environments (e.g., the core of the Sun, a terrestrial reactor, a supernova) may exist as different knots on the manifold. While their oscillation behavior would be identical, their absolute masses could be subtly different. This could potentially be detected by future experiments capable of measuring the absolute neutrino mass with extreme precision.

## §5 · Assemblé
We began by seeking a single point of light in the darkness, a set of constants to validate our theory. Instead, we found a constellation. The discovery of the Prime Resonance Manifold changes our understanding of physical law from a rigid decree to a geometric relationship. It suggests the universe is not built on a single, immutable foundation, but is woven from a fabric that allows for an infinite number of valid knots, each one a perfect expression of the underlying resonance. The neutrino, in this view, is not a static object, but a dynamic equilibrium—a knot of pure geometry, tied perfectly on a surface of possibility.

## Appendix: Original Protocol
PPS-ν-001 · Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law (Γ–Ki–Tₐ)
Law. For each mass eigenstate νᵢ,
$$ m_i = \mu_\nu;\Big(\tfrac{\mathrm{PR}i}{3}\Big)^{p};\big(\mathrm{Purity}i\big)^{q}, \qquad
\mathrm{Purity}i = \max\alpha |U{\alpha i}|^2, \quad \mathrm{PR}i = \frac{1}{\sum\alpha |U{\alpha i}|^4}. $$

Γ-matter toggle (production geometry correction).
We model small matter/production effects by a bounded adjustment to column adherence:
$$ T'{a,i} = T{a,i},[1 + \epsilon,\Gamma,(T_{a,i} - \overline{T_a})], \quad \epsilon=0.1,; \Gamma\in{0,0.5,1}. $$
This increases/decreases adherence contrast around the column mean without changing ordering-agnostic structure.

Fitting protocol.

1. Build PMNS from (θ₁₂,θ₁₃,θ₂₃,δ) using PDG-like input; compute (PRᵢ, Purityᵢ).

2. Normal ordering (NO): fit (p,q,μ_ν) to (Δm²₂₁, Δm²₃₁).

3. Inverted ordering (IO): freeze (p,q) from NO; refit μ_ν only to (Δm²₂₁, Δm²₃₁|_{IO}).

4. Report absolute masses, Σm, and derived observables (m_β, m_ββ range).

$$ T'_{a,i} = T_{a,i}\,[1 + \epsilon\,\Gamma\,(T_{a,i} - \overline{T_a})], \quad \epsilon=0.1,\; \Gamma\in\{0,0.5,1\}. $$
This increases/decreases adherence contrast around the column mean without changing ordering-agnostic structure.

**Fitting protocol.**
1. Build PMNS from (θ₁₂,θ₁₃,θ₂₃,δ) using PDG-like input; compute (PRᵢ, Purityᵢ).
2. **Normal ordering (NO):** fit (p,q,μ_ν) to (Δm²₂₁, Δm²₃₁).
3. **Inverted ordering (IO):** **freeze (p,q)** from NO; refit **μ_ν only** to (Δm²₂₁, Δm²₃₁|_{IO}).
4. Report absolute masses, Σm, and derived observables (m_β, m_ββ range).

**Order-independence result.** The same exponents (p,q) learned in NO also fit IO (μ_ν re-solved only), indicating **no intrinsic ordering dependence** in the geometry → mass mapping.

## Derived observables

- Effective electron-neutrino mass (β decay): $ m_\beta = \sqrt{\sum_i |U_{ei}|^2 m_i^2} $.
- Neutrinoless double-β effective mass range: $ m_{\beta\beta} = \big|\sum_i U_{ei}^2 m_i e^{i\alpha_i}\big| $, with unknown Majorana phases $\alpha_{2,3}$. We report $[m_{\beta\beta}^{\min},\; m_{\beta\beta}^{\max}]$ from a coarse phase scan.

**Provenance.** Inputs: `Neutrino_Mixing.json`, `Neutrino_Properties.json` (PDG-style). This module was generated programmatically alongside the tables above for full reproducibility.

**Falsifiers.** If future global fits force different (p,q) between NO and IO to match the two Δm² targets, the law upgrades to include a small δ- or Γ-dependent term in $G_i$ or $T_a$, but the current results do **not** require it.
