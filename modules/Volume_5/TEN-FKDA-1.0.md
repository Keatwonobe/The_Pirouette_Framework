## §1 · Purpose
To formalize, analyze, and predict 'Fork' events as critical bifurcation points where a system divides into two or more distinct evolutionary pathways, leading to persistent, divergent trajectories in parameter space.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Fork events occur when a system's parameter space develops multiple stable attractors of comparable strength, forcing trajectory separation and symmetry breaking. Time-Adherence ($T_a$) characteristically dips at the bifurcation point then recovers along separate branches; Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) temporarily increases, allowing exploration of multiple pathways; and the $K_i$ constant influences the symmetry properties of the bifurcation, with symmetric forks showing $K_i$-modulated phase separations.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a$ shows a characteristic dip during the critical phase of bifurcation, then evolves independently for each new branch. Its evolution is modeled by $T_a(t)$ across pre-bifurcation, critical, and post-bifurcation phases.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: $\Gamma$ temporarily increases at the bifurcation point, facilitating the exploration of new pathways before decreasing as new stable branches form.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ influences symmetry properties of the fork, with symmetric bifurcations potentially showing phase separations at intervals related to $2\pi/K_i$.
* **Wound Channels**: Fork events create distinctive Y-shaped wound channels, with each branch carrying partitioned history and diverging information structures.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Time-series data of system parameters leading up to and potentially through a bifurcation point. Data on the system's potential field $V(\Gamma, T_a, \phi, t)$ or factors allowing its estimation. Information about system stability and sensitivity to fluctuations.
* **And Structure**: Numerical arrays representing system state trajectories. Gridded potential field data. For abstract systems, a defined parameter space and rules governing state transitions or attractor formation.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient data to observe the system approaching an instability (e.g., $\lambda_{min}(\nabla^2 V) \rightarrow 0$) and to characterize the emergence of multiple distinct pathways or stable states post-bifurcation.
* **Steps**: Estimation of $T_a(t)$ and $\Gamma(t)$ trajectories. Mapping of the system's potential field $V_{fork}$ and its evolution. Identification of attractor states and their stability (e.g., via eigenvalues of the Hessian of $V_{fork}$). Normalization of parameters if comparing across different scales.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. System State & Potential Field Analysis: Track the system's trajectory and evolution of its potential field $V_{fork}(\Gamma,T_a,\phi,t)$. Monitor stability of current attractors (e.g., $\lambda_{min}(\nabla^2V)$).
2. Fork Phase Identification: Determine if the system is in Pre-Bifurcation ($\lambda_{min}(\nabla^2V) \rightarrow 0$), Critical Phase ($\lambda_{min}(\nabla^2V) = 0$), or Post-Bifurcation (multiple stable attractors). Analyze $T_a(t)$ and $\Gamma(t)$ trajectories for characteristic patterns across these phases.
3. Bifurcation Classification: Based on the mathematical structure of the potential field change around $t=\tau$, classify the fork (Saddle-Node, Pitchfork, Transcritical, Hopf, Period-Doubling).
4. Fork Dimension Profiling: Quantify the fork event across the 12 Resonant Fork Dimensions ($F_1$ Symmetry Breaking ... $F_{12}$ Wound Channel Bifurcation).
5. Wound Channel Analysis: Model the Y-shaped Fork Wound Channel ($\\Phi_{fork}$) and characterize history partitioning, information divergence, and junction echoes.
6. Branch Analysis: For post-bifurcation systems, analyze emerging branches for their properties (stability $\Delta V_j$, divergence rate $v_{div}$, phase separation $\Delta\phi_{ij}$, probability $P(branch_j)$).
7. Multi-Generation Tree Mapping (if applicable): If cascade of forks occurs, map the resulting tree structure $\mathcal{T}$ and calculate its complexity $C_{\mathcal{T}}$.
8. Delayed Choice Assessment (if applicable): Evaluate the potential for influencing branch selection post-bifurcation using the delayed choice mechanism equation.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Identification and timing of bifurcation event(s) ($\tau$). Classification of bifurcation type. Profile scores for the 12 Fork Dimensions. Characterization of emergent branches (number, properties, probabilities). Map of Fork Wound Channel structure. Multi-generation fork tree visualization (if applicable).
* **Insights And Derivations**: Understanding of critical decision points or evolutionary divergences in a system. Prediction of the number and nature of potential future pathways. Assessment of system sensitivity to small fluctuations near bifurcation points. Analysis of how historical information is partitioned or transformed across diverging branches. Basis for strategies to influence or navigate fork events.
* **Guidelines**: The bifurcation type indicates the fundamental nature of the split (e.g., Pitchfork implies symmetric branching). The 12 Fork Dimensions provide a detailed fingerprint of the event (e.g., high Criticality Index means high sensitivity). Branch probabilities $P(branch_j)$ guide expectation. Wound channel analysis shows how influence and memory diverge post-fork. A decreasing $T_a$ followed by branching and then $T_a$ recovery on each branch is a key signature.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Fork Potential Field Evolution (Conceptual)
$$ V_{fork}(t) = V_{0}\cdot(1-H(t-\tau)) + \sum_{j=1}^{N}\alpha_{j}(t)\cdot V_{j}\cdot H(t-\tau) $$
Models the potential field transforming from a single well $V_0$ to multiple branch potentials $V_j$ after bifurcation time $\tau$.

### Time-Adherence Evolution During Fork (Critical Phase Example)
$$ T_a(t) = T_{a,min}+(T_{a,initial}-T_{a,min})|\frac{t-\tau}{\Delta t_{crit}}|^{-\eta} \text{ for } \tau-\Delta t_{crit} \le t < \tau+\Delta t_{crit} $$
Illustrates the characteristic dip in $T_a$ around the bifurcation time $\tau$.

### Fork Wound Channel (Conceptual Y-Shape)
$$ \Phi_{fork} = \Phi_{pre}H(\tau-t) + \sum \Phi_{branch_j}H(t-\tau)R_j $$
Represents the wound channel splitting from a pre-bifurcation channel $\Phi_{pre}$ into multiple branch channels $\Phi_{branch_j}$ in their respective regions $R_j$.

### Branch Selection Probability
$$ P(branch_{j})=\frac{e^{-\beta\Delta V_{j}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{N}e^{-\beta\Delta V_{k}}} $$
Calculates the probability of a system following a specific branch $j$ based on its potential barrier $\Delta V_j$ and a noise/temperature parameter $\beta$.
