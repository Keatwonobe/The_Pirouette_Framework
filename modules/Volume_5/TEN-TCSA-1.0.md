## §1 · Purpose
To analyze how systems maintain and transition between different Time-Adherence ($T_a$) states across multiple temporal scales, revealing multi-scale dynamics, resonance patterns, and phase transitions.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Systems maintain and exhibit coherence differently across various temporal scales. Analyzing the spectrum of Time-Adherence ($T_a$) values across these scales allows for the mapping of multi-scale dynamics, the identification of resonant synchronization between scales, and the detection of system-wide phase transitions. [cite: 47]

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: This is the primary parameter being analyzed. The mode calculates $T_a(s)$ for each temporal scale 's' of the input signal to construct a coherence spectrogram. [cite: 49]
* **Phase (θ(x,s))**: Phase information is crucial for calculating $T_a(s)$ at each scale. The input signal must either contain phase information or it must be extractable via techniques like wavelet transforms. [cite: 49, 102]
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: While not directly an input parameter for TCSA itself, the identified resonance peaks or periodicities in $T_a$ across scales might exhibit $K_i$-harmonic relationships, especially when combined with Ki-Harmonic Decomposition in workflows like Multi-Scale Coherence Analysis. [cite: 91, 93]

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Multi-scale time series data. The signal must contain, or allow for the extraction of, phase information. [cite: 102]
* **And Structure**: A numerical array or stream representing the time series signal.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient signal length to allow for meaningful decomposition into the desired range of time scales and stable $T_a$ calculation at each scale.
* **Steps**: Signal denoising if necessary. If phase information is not explicit, it must be extractable (e.g., analytic signal construction via Hilbert transform, or using complex wavelet transforms).

### 3·2 · Operational Parameters

| `scaleMin, scaleMax, scaleStep` | Parameters defining the range and resolution of temporal scales to be analyzed (e.g., for wavelet transform). [cite: 54] | `Domain-dependent, based on expected periodicities in the signal.` |
| `multiResolutionAnalysisTechnique` | Choice of method for multi-scale decomposition (e.g., Wavelet Transform, filter banks). | `Wavelet Transform (e.g., Morlet, Mexican Hat) is common. [cite: 48]` |
| `windowSize (for local Ta calculation)` | Size of the local window used for integrating phase information to calculate $T_a$ at each time point and scale. [cite: 54] | `Dependent on the scale being analyzed.` |

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Multi-scale Decomposition: Apply a chosen multi-resolution analysis technique (e.g., wavelet transform) to decompose the input signal into different time scales (s). [cite: 48]
2. Scale-specific $T_a$ Calculation: For each scale 's' and at each time point 't' (or within local windows), calculate the local Time-Adherence $T_a(t,s) = |\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j} e^{i\theta(x_j,s)}|^2$, where $\theta(x_j,s)$ is the local phase at that scale and $N$ is the number of points in the local window. [cite: 49, 54]
3. Coherence Spectrogram Construction: Create a 2D map (spectrogram) with time on one axis, temporal scales on the other axis, and the calculated $T_a(t,s)$ values as the intensity or color at each point. [cite: 49]
4. Resonance Peak Identification: Analyze the spectrogram to identify scales or regions where $T_a$ values are consistently high or synchronize across scales, indicating cross-scale coherence or resonant frequencies. [cite: 50]
5. Phase Transition Detection: Locate abrupt changes or discontinuities in $T_a$ values across scales or time, as these are indicators of system-wide transitions or regime shifts. [cite: 51]
6. Stability Analysis (Optional): Quantify temporal stability by calculating the coherence gradient with respect to scale, $\nabla_s T_a(s) = \partial T_a(s) / \partial s$. Regions of steep gradients indicate instability or rapid change in coherence properties. [cite: 52]

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: A 2D coherence spectrogram (matrix of $T_a$ values vs. time and scale). Lists of identified resonance peaks, phase transition points/regions, and optionally a stability map derived from $\nabla_s T_a(s)$. [cite: 54]
* **Insights And Derivations**: Understanding of how a system's coherence is structured across multiple time scales. Identification of dominant rhythms and their interactions. Detection of synchronization between different oscillatory components. Early warning signs of system-wide phase transitions or regime shifts. Characterization of the stability of temporal patterns.
* **Guidelines**: High $T_a$ bands in the spectrogram indicate strong coherence at those specific time scales. Synchronized peaks across multiple scales suggest resonant coupling. Abrupt changes in the $T_a$ spectrum often signal critical transitions. Low, noisy $T_a$ values across scales indicate decoherent or chaotic system dynamics.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Scale-Specific Time-Adherence Calculation
$$ T_a(s) = |\frac{1}{V}\int_V e^{i\theta(x,s)}dV|^2 \quad \text{or for discrete local windows:} \quad T_a(t,s) = |\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j} e^{i\theta(x_j,s)}|^2 $$
Calculates the Time-Adherence for a given scale 's' (and potentially time 't') by integrating or averaging phase information $\theta(x,s)$ extracted from the signal at that scale.

### Coherence Gradient (for Stability Analysis)
$$ \nabla_s T_a(s) = \frac{\partial T_a(s)}{\partial s} $$
Calculates the rate of change of Time-Adherence with respect to scale, used to assess the stability of temporal patterns.

### Multi-Resolution Analysis (e.g., Wavelet Transform)
$$ W(s, \tau) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) \psi^*_{s,\tau}(t) dt $$
Generic form for wavelet transform, where $x(t)$ is the signal and $\psi_{s,\tau}(t)$ is the wavelet at scale 's' and translation $\tau$. This decomposes the signal into scale-specific components from which phase can be extracted.
