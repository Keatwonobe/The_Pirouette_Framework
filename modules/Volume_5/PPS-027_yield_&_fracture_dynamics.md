## §1 · Abstract
This module completes Volume 2’s mechanics by mapping **classical deformation physics** onto Pirouette field space. It formalises (i) the **Pirouette Yield Point**—where recoverable elasticity surrenders to irreversible wound-channel re-write—and (ii) **Fracture Propagation**, the runaway post-yield collapse mode that shards coherence. Bridging tensors translate external stress–energy into gradients of Time-Adherence ($T_a$) and Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$), embedding material science inside the Reality Funnel framework of PPS-026. This version finalizes the Stress-Coherence Tensor's covariant form and provides concrete cross-domain examples of failure modes.

## §2 · Yield Principles Reframed
The Twelve Resonant Yield Principles—Elasticity, Plasticity, Threshold, Hysteresis, …, Coupling—are emergent properties of a system navigating a yield potential landscape $V_{yield}(\Gamma,T_a,\phi)$. Yield occurs when a trajectory, driven by sufficient coherence stress, escapes the local minimum of the "elastic" attractor and transitions to the "plastic" plateau. This move is irreversible and permanently re-writes the system's baseline resonant structure by altering its Wound Channel (PPS-008).

## §3 · The Stress-Coherence Tensor ($\sigma_{PC}$)

To connect external, classical forces with the internal Pirouette field dynamics, we define the Stress-Coherence Tensor, $\sigma_{PC}$. This tensor translates the familiar stress-energy tensor ($T^{\mu\nu}$) into the language of coherence gradients.

### §3.1 · Covariant Formulation
In the manifestly covariant grammar of PPS-006, the Stress-Coherence Tensor is defined as:

```latex
\sigma_{PC}^{\mu\nu} = A(\nabla^{\mu}T_a \nabla^{\nu}T_a - \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\alpha}T_a \nabla^{\alpha}T_a) - B(\nabla^{\mu}\Gamma \nabla^{\nu}\Gamma - \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\alpha}\Gamma \nabla^{\alpha}\Gamma) + C \mathcal{L}_{int} g^{\mu\nu}
```

* **Components**:
    * The terms involving $A$ and $B$ represent the anisotropic stresses induced by the gradients of the $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ fields, respectively. This form ensures the tensor is traceless in the absence of interactions, representing pure shear stress on the coherence field.
    * $A, B, C$ are coupling constants that determine the material's or system's response to stress.
    * $\mathcal{L}_{int}$ is the interaction Lagrangian density representing the coupling to other fields (e.g., electromagnetic), which contributes an isotropic pressure component.
* **Trace**: The trace of this tensor, $\operatorname{Tr}(\sigma_{PC}) = \sigma_{PC\mu}^{\mu}$, gives the scalar **coherence stress**, $S_{coh}$, which is the key parameter driving the system towards its yield threshold.

## §4 · The Pirouette Yield Condition
A system transitions from elastic (recoverable) to plastic (irreversible) deformation when the internally generated coherence stress surpasses a critical threshold, $S_{crit}$, which is itself a function of the system's state.

```latex
S_{coh} \equiv a(\nabla T_a)^2 - b(\nabla\Gamma)^2 > S_{crit}(T_a, \Gamma_{rest})
```

This formulation mirrors classical criteria like the von Mises yield criterion but is expressed in fundamental coherence coordinates. The term $a(\nabla T_a)^2$ represents the destabilizing pressure from coherence gradients (stress concentrations), while $b(\nabla\Gamma)^2$ represents the system's intrinsic rigidity and resistance to deformation from its confinement field.

## §5 · Post-Yield Fracture Mechanics
Once a system yields, its local confinement ($\Gamma$) is compromised, making it susceptible to fracture. A fault line, initiated during yield, concentrates energy and propagates as a crack front along the path of steepest coherence degradation ($\nabla T_a$).

The velocity of this crack propagation is modeled by the seed law, which aligns with TEN-FDA parameters:

```latex
v_{crack} = v_{max}\,(1 - e^{-k(\Gamma_{local} - \Gamma_{crit})})
```

This law dictates that the speed of failure is directly tied to how far the local confinement has decayed past its critical yield point.

## §6 · Cross-Domain Failure Mode Taxonomy
The principles of yield and fracture are universal. The following table instantiates the failure modes across different domains, linking them through their Pirouette field signatures.

| Domain            | Failure Mode         | $T_a$ Trend       | $\Gamma$ Trend      | Interpretation                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Material Science** | Brittle Fracture (Glass) | Sharp $\Delta T_a > 0.5$ | Low               | High rigidity, no plastic deformation, rapid crack. |
|                   | Ductile Fracture (Steel) | Gradual $\Delta T_a < 0.3$ | Moderate            | Absorbs energy via plasticity before slow failure.  |
| **Economics** | Market Crash (Panic Sell) | Runaway $T_a \to 0$ | $\Gamma \to 0$      | Loss of confidence ($\Gamma$), cascading panic ($T_a$).    |
|                   | Recession (Stagflation) | Gradual Creep     | Cyclic/Low          | Slow loss of productive capacity, low market confidence. |
| **Psychology** | Mental Breakdown   | Sharp $\Delta T_a > 0.7$ | Low               | Acute stress overwhelms coping mechanisms ($\Gamma$).     |
|                   | Burnout              | Gradual Creep     | Decaying            | Chronic stress erodes resilience, leading to apathy. |

## §7 · Integration with Collapse Order Parameter
The global collapse parameter $\chi = (1 - T_a)\Gamma$ from PPS-026 serves as a predictive tool. Fracture becomes imminent when the local yield condition and the global collapse condition are met simultaneously:

1.  $S_{coh} > S_{crit}$ (The local stress exceeds the material's yield strength).
2.  $\partial_t\chi > \chi/\tau_c$ (The system as a whole is losing coherence faster than it can recover).

This duality shows that local material failure (a crack) is a direct instantiation of a wider, systemic collapse dynamic governed by the Reality Funnel.

## §8 · Simulation Specification (v1.2 Milestone)
The next step is to implement the simulation outlined in the previous version:

1.  **Lattice Setup**: 2-D oscillator grid with assigned baseline $T_a, \Gamma$ and coupling constants A, B, C.
2.  **Load Function**: Apply an external stress field $T_{\mu\nu}$ and compute the resulting $\sigma_{PC}$ across the grid.
3.  **Dynamics**: Evolve the fields according to the Pirouette equations, applying the yield condition at each time step.
4.  **Outputs**: Generate a crack-path heat-map, a plot of $v_{crack}(t)$, and a map of the residual $T_a$ distribution to visualize the "scar" on the system's wound channel.

---

## §9 · Road-Map
* **v1.2**: Implement the simulation specified in §8.
* **v1.3**: Calibrate the simulation against real-world data for at least two domains (e.g., crack propagation in steel and a historical stock market crash).
* **v2.0**: Expose API endpoints from the simulation to TEN-YDA / TEN-FDA for live system auditing and failure prediction.

## §10 · Closing Assertion
Yield is coherence’s tipping-point; fracture is its scream. By recasting stress and strain into $T_a$–$\Gamma$ space, we gain a unified lens through which metals snap, markets crash, and minds break—yet also how they heal, adapt, and transcend. Master these dynamics, and any intelligence can steer systems away from shatter toward resonant resilience.
