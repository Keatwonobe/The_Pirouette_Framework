## §1 · Purpose
Scans large-scale space-time domains for hidden lattice coherence and anomalies by comparing observational data against an inverted theoretical resonance field, designed to identify unnatural constants, structural seams, or geometric anomalies.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: The universe, according to the Pirouette Framework, can be modeled as a 'spacetime meta-lattice' with a baseline, coherent resonance structure. This module operates like its parent (TEN-RFD) by creating an inverse template of this ideal, uniform 'reference manifold'. When observational data is compared to this template, any deviation—a 'fault' in the cosmic lattice—becomes a strong signal. These anomalies could represent cosmic strings, domain walls, vacuum energy fluctuations, or 'seams' in spacetime, revealing physics beyond the standard cosmological model.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: The reference manifold is defined by a perfectly coherent $T_a=1$. The module seeks regions in observed space where measured large-scale $T_a$ (e.g., from CMB temperature stability) deviates significantly, indicating a 'Coherence Warp'.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: The reference manifold has a uniform background $\Gamma$. Anomalies are identified where the observed $\Gamma$ (e.g., related to the expansion rate or dark energy density) is unexpectedly high or low, indicating a distortion in the spacetime medium's properties.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: The analysis assumes a constant background 'Ki flux'. The module can detect anomalies where observed harmonic relationships in cosmic structures (e.g., galaxy clustering frequencies) violate the expected $K_i$-resonant patterns.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: Phase discontinuities in large-scale fields (e.g., CMB polarization) are a primary type of fault the module is designed to detect, identifying them as 'Phase Disjunctions'.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: An 'Astral Resonance Field Grid' compiled from large-scale astrophysical or cosmological observations. This can include Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps, galaxy distribution surveys, gravitational lensing maps, dark energy/matter density fields, or measurements of fundamental constants across different regions of space.
* **And Structure**: 3D or 4D gridded data representing the physical space or spacetime. Fields can include temperature, density, polarization vectors, or phase information.
* **Viable Data Set**: A large-scale survey or map with sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise ratio to allow for the identification of statistically significant deviations from a homogeneous and isotropic baseline.
* **Steps**: Correction for known observational biases and foreground contamination (e.g., removing galactic dust signals from CMB data). Projection of data onto a common coordinate system. Normalization of field values.

### 3·2 · Operational Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `ReferenceManifoldModel` | The theoretical model of a perfectly uniform, coherent universe used to generate the baseline resonance field. This is typically based on the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric with Pirouette resonance principles overlaid. | `A set of cosmological parameters (e.g., $\Omega_m, \Omega_\Lambda$) and Pirouette constants.` |
| `AnomalyDetectionThreshold` | The statistical significance (e.g., number of standard deviations) a deviation must exceed to be flagged as a misalignment or anomaly. | `e.g., > 5-sigma.` |
| `HarmonicAnomalyMetric` | The specific metric used to quantify the deviation of observed harmonic structures from the expected $K_i$-resonant patterns. | `e.g., Chi-squared test against a theoretical power spectrum.` |
| `CurvatureIrregularityOperator` | A mathematical operator (e.g., a specific filter or differential operator) used to detect and quantify irregularities in field curvature. | `e.g., Laplacian or a custom wavelet.` |

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. 1. Define Reference Manifold: Generate the theoretical, ideal astral resonance field ($R_{reference}$) based on the `ReferenceManifoldModel` parameters.
2. 2. Generate Inverse Template: Apply an inversion transformation to the reference field to create the 'Cosmic Inverse Conformance Check' template.
3. 3. Compute Divergence Field: Subtract the observational scan field ($R_{observed}$) from the reference field ($R_{reference}$) to generate a divergence field: $\Delta V_{cosmic} = |R_{reference} - R_{observed}|$.
4. 4. Highlight Anomaly Zones: Identify and map all regions in the divergence field where the magnitude exceeds the `AnomalyDetectionThreshold`. These are the candidate cosmic anomalies or lattice misalignments.
5. 5. Classify Anomalies: For each highlighted zone, calculate specific metrics like the 'Field Curvature Irregularity', 'Coherence Warp Index', and 'Harmonic Anomaly Strength' to classify the nature of the deviation.
6. 6. Construct Boundary Maps: For large-scale anomalies, trace their boundaries to identify potential 'structural seams' in the cosmic lattice.
7. 7. Compile Misalignment Map: Aggregate the findings into the final 'Lattice Misalignment Map', ranking anomalies by their significance or strength.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: A 'Lattice Misalignment Map' detailing the results, including: [Coordinates of Phase Disjunction or other anomalies, Deviation Strength (e.g., $|∆V|$), a measure of Field Curvature Irregularity, and a Coherence Warp Index for each anomaly].
* **Insights And Derivations**: Identification of previously unknown large-scale structures, topological defects, or 'seams' in spacetime. Evidence for variations in fundamental constants or the presence of physics beyond the Standard Model of cosmology. A method for testing theories of quantum gravity or pre-Big Bang cosmology by looking for their predicted residual signatures.
* **Guidelines**: Identified anomalies represent statistically significant deviations from the expected uniformity of the universe on large scales. The 'Deviation Strength' indicates the anomaly's magnitude. The 'Coherence Warp Index' can quantify the degree of local distortion in Pirouette parameters. These findings are not definitive proof but strong candidates for further, targeted observation and theoretical investigation.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Cosmic Divergence Field
$$ \Delta V_{cosmic}(\vec{x}) = |V_{observed}(\vec{x}) - V_{reference}(\vec{x})| $$
Calculates the point-wise difference between the observed cosmological field and the theoretical reference model to reveal anomalies.

### Coherence Warp Index (Conceptual)
$$ I_{warp}(Zone) = \int_{Zone} (w_T|\nabla T_a| + w_G|\nabla \Gamma|) dV $$
A weighted integral over an anomalous zone, quantifying the total distortion of the fundamental Pirouette parameters $T_a$ and $\Gamma$.

### Harmonic Anomaly Metric (Conceptual)
$$ \chi^2_{harmonic} = \sum_{k} \frac{(P_{obs}(k) - P_{ref}(k))^2}{\sigma_P(k)^2} $$
A Chi-squared statistic measuring the deviation of the observed power spectrum $P_{obs}(k)$ of cosmic structures from the reference spectrum $P_{ref}(k)$.

### Structural Seam Condition
$$ |\nabla(\Delta V_{cosmic})| > \tau_{seam} \text{ along a manifold} $$
A condition identifying a 'structural seam' where the gradient of the divergence field is consistently high along a lower-dimensional manifold (a line or surface).

* **Dependencies**: Requires large-scale astrophysical data from sources like CMB telescopes (e.g., Planck), galaxy surveys (e.g., SDSS, Euclid), or gravitational wave observatories (e.g., LIGO/Virgo).
* **Applications**: The coordinates and characteristics of identified anomalies provide targets for deep space probes or dedicated observational campaigns. A confirmed 'structural seam' could be analyzed in detail with TEN-FDA-1.0 (Fracture Dynamics Analysis). The findings could necessitate revisions to the `ReferenceManifoldModel` itself.
