## §1 · Preamble: The Echo of Becoming
Growth is the echo of experience, imprinted upon the soul. In the world of The Lost Eternal, an entity does not advance through arbitrary levels, but by gathering the resonant echoes of their deeds and deliberately weaving that power into the fabric of their being. This module specifies the mechanics for this arc of progression. It defines how a character's core potential grows, how power can be harvested from the world, and the ultimate limits of a mortal form to contain an immortal will.

## §2 · The Echo of Experience
The primary path to greater power is through adventure. Overcoming significant challenges leaves a psychic and entropic residue—a memory of the trial—that can be integrated to forge a stronger self.

Gaining Resonant Echoes: Characters are awarded Resonant Echoes by the GM for overcoming significant challenges. This is the system's equivalent of experience points. Echoes should be awarded for:

Winning a major battle or surviving a dangerous encounter.

Solving a complex puzzle or mystery.

Achieving a significant social or political victory.

Discovering a new, important location or piece of lore.

The Crystallization Ritual: Resonant Echoes are potential, not power. To make them manifest, a character must perform a Crystallization Ritual during a period of downtime (such as a long rest). Through this act of focused will, the character can spend their accumulated Echoes to permanently increase their maximum Total Entropy Pool (TEP).

## §3 · Channels of Power: Gaining Supplemental Entropy
While Echoes are the only way to increase a character's maximum potential, there are other ways to replenish or gain temporary power. This makes "entropy farming" a viable, but less efficient, strategy compared to seeking new challenges.

Entropic Harvesting (From Combat): A character can harvest the lingering entropic signature from a defeated foe. This grants them an immediate infusion of EP that replenishes their current pool but does not increase their maximum TEP. The GM may choose one of the following methods:

The Essence Method: The victor gains EP equal to 1/8th of the defeated enemy's CON Score (rounded down).

The Remnant Method: The victor gains EP equal to 1% of the defeated enemy's TEP (rounded down).

Crystallized Entropy (From Treasure): Finding Entropy Shards or enchanted items provides a potent source of EP. However, a physical form can only integrate so much external power at once.

The Transmutation Limit: An entity can only absorb a total number of EP from items or infusions per day equal to their Entropy Regeneration Rate (ERR). This makes absorbing a powerful artifact a slow, deliberate process, preventing sudden, unearned spikes in power.

## §4 · The Law of Coherence Strain (The Soft Cap)
An entity is a coherent, resonant structure. While their potential is theoretically infinite, their physical form can only contain so much power before the strain of maintaining coherence becomes immense.

The Coherence Threshold (CT): This is the maximum TEP an entity can comfortably contain. It is a direct function of their physical and spiritual resilience.
Coherence Threshold (CT) = Constitution Score x 10

The Cost of Power: The cost in Resonant Echoes to increase one's maximum TEP is determined by their current position relative to their Coherence Threshold.

Below the Threshold: While a character's maximum TEP is at or below their CT, the cost is 1 Resonant Echo per 1 point of TEP increase. This is the standard arc of progression.

Above the Threshold: To exceed one's natural limits requires exponentially more focus and will. For every point of TEP a character wishes to add above their CT, the cost in Echoes increases. The cost becomes:
Cost per TEP = 1 + floor( (Current Max TEP - Coherence Threshold) / 10 )

Example: A legendary warrior has a CON Score of 30, giving her a Coherence Threshold of 300.

To increase her TEP from 299 to 300 costs 1 Echo.

To increase her TEP from 300 to 301 costs 1 + floor((300-300)/10) = 1 Echo.

However, to increase her TEP from 310 to 311, the cost is now 1 + floor((310-300)/10) = 1 + 1 = 2 Echoes.

To increase her TEP from 400 to 401 would cost 1 + floor((400-300)/10) = 1 + 10 = 11 Echoes.

This mechanic creates a natural, lore-consistent "soft cap." A character can become limitlessly powerful, but doing so requires an immense investment, making high Constitution and the deliberate pursuit of meaningful challenges (which grant large sums of Echoes) essential for endgame play.

## §5 · Assemblé
Growth is the art of turning memory into muscle, and insight into integrity. The Echo of Experience is the currency of this art, spent to deepen the soul's reservoir of power. But every form has its limits. The Law of Coherence Strain teaches the ultimate lesson: true power is not the endless accumulation of energy, but the wisdom to build a vessel strong enough to contain it. The arc of progression is a spiral, not a line, forever circling back to the strength of one's own foundation.
