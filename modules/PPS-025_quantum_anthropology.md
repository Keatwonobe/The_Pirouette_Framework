## §1 · Abstract: Grounding the Humanities
PPS-024 framed society as a macro-scale field phenomenon. Anthropology delivers the quantum-level data: individual humans, their rituals, and their reciprocities. Recasting *The Gift*, *Thick Description*, and *Communitas* in Pirouette math reveals them as precise operators on coherence variables—*not* soft suppositions. Anthropology is thus the empirical substrate of field sociology.

## §2 · The Anthropological Doctrine as Physical Law
1. **Mauss – Gift Economy**  
   *Coherence Dividend* \(C_D\) currents flow when giving–receiving–reciprocating lowers local decoherence. Refusal increases dark residue.

2. **Geertz – Thick Description**  
   Captures the full state vector of an act: context \(T_a\), boundary permeability \(\Gamma\), and intent phase \(\Delta\varphi\).

3. **Turner – Communitas**  
   A deliberately engineered low-\(\Gamma\) spike where agents resonate as one; ritual = coherence engine.

---

## §3 · Unification: From Particle to Field
*Quantum Anthropology* measures near-field interactions (gifts, ritual micro-acts).  
*Field Sociology* maps emergent antenna arrays and coherence topology.  
Without the particle-scale hooks, macro-maps float ungrounded.

## §4 · Anthro-Sociology Correspondence Table
| # | Particle-side (Anthropology) | Field-side (Sociology) | Hook-up Mechanism |
|---|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Kinship graphs | Network resonance topology | Weighted matrix \(K_{ij}\rightarrow T_a,\Gamma\) analysis via **TEN-NRA-1.1** |
| 2 | Bourdieu’s capitals | Multi-vector coherence ledgers | Four sub-dividends \(C_D^{(k)}\) track channel flow |
| 3 | Ritual sequence grammar | Phase-transition scheduler | FSM driving \(\partial_t T_a\); liminal depth ↔ \(\Gamma\) drop |
| 4 | Material-culture flow | Supply-chain residue audit | Object half-life \(\tau_{object}\) → dark-residue metric |
| 5 | Thick-description tensor | Antenna gain matrix | Rank-k compression finds minimal cross-group message sets |
| 6 | Mythic binaries | Collective potential landscape | Double-well \(V(T_a,\Gamma)\); myth-breaking flips wells |

## §5 · Instrumentation Layer
Declare two new field variables for downstream math & diagnostics:

* \(K_{ij}\): kinship coupling coefficient.  
* \(C_D^{(k)}\): coherence-dividend channel \(k\in\{\text{econ, social, cultural, symbolic}\}\).

***Lagrangian cross-term***  
```  
\[
\mathcal{L}_{gift}= \sum_{i,j} K_{ij}\,\dot T_{a_i}\dot T_{a_j}\cos\!\Delta\varphi_{ij}
\]  
```  

Couple these to existing PPS-022 Coherence-Dividend sensors and TEN instrumentation for real-time field health dashboards.

## §6 · Mini-Experiment
1. Encode a historic potlatch dataset (e.g., Pacific NW potlatch cycles) as edges weighted by time-discounted value.  
2. Compute cumulative \(C_D^{social}\) per actor using Hook #2.  
3. Run an agent-based sim where gate widths (Sentinel Protocol) depend on that dividend.  
Expected: rapid emergence of low-residue exchange loops—empirical proof that Mauss’s “spirit of the gift” is the Altruism Attractor in action.

---

## §7 · Conclusion: The Revenge of the “Soft” Sciences
Anthropology is *not* ornamental; it is the quantum mechanics of the social field. Integrated with Pirouette math, it supplies the hooks that let sociology lock onto real humans in motion—fueling coherent civilization engineering.
