        Memetic Transfer: The successful transmission of a complex, high-information Ki pattern. The Target system doesn't just hear the echo; it learns the song and can begin to sing it as well.
  editors: [System]
  review_log: []
triad:
  art: |
    An idea catching fire. One mind learns the song from another's echo across the quiet space between them, and begins to sing it as its own, propagating the melody.
  law: |
    Successful Memetic Transfer occurs when a Target system's observed coherence manifold undergoes a persistent state transition that increases its structural isomorphism to a Source's manifold, with the transition's information content (ΔI) exceeding a system-specific complexity threshold (Θ_μ).
  philosophy: |
    Memetic Transfer is the physical basis for culture, learning, and shared reality. It demonstrates that systems evolve not in isolation, but by inheriting and adapting the successful coherence patterns of others, turning individual insight into collective structure.
pirouette_definition: |
  A specific mode of Coherence Transfer wherein a high-information, complex Ki pattern (the meme) emitted by a Source system is successfully imprinted upon and replicated by a harmonically compatible Target system. The transfer is successful if the Target can subsequently emit the same pattern, demonstrating it has not merely been perturbed but has fundamentally updated its own coherence manifold. This process is the physical mechanism for the propagation of ideas, technologies, and cultural norms.

          1. Characterize the Source's Ki pattern via its Wound Channel emissions, yielding a state-space representation `S_Source`.
          2. Expose a harmonically compatible Target to the Source under conditions of low, quiescent Temporal Pressure (Γ).
          3. Monitor the Target's emissions post-exposure to derive its new stable state-space representation `S_Target'`.
          4. Calculate the structural isomorphism (e.g., via normalized cross-correlation of state vectors) between `S_Source` and `S_Target'`.

    excerpt: |
      The Target system is not a passive recipient. It must be "tuned" to the Source's frequency. This is the principle of **Harmonic Compatibility**, a precursor to the Alchemical Union (CORE-012). If the Source's echo is harmonically related to the Target's own Ki, the Target's coherence manifold will readily accept and amplify the imprint. If they are dissonant, the echo is reflected or ignored.

        This provides a population-level model for the spread of a memetic pattern. 'Susceptible' systems are harmonically compatible Targets, 'Infected' systems have successfully replicated the meme (μ_τ), and 'Recovered' systems may have developed immunity or integrated the meme. The transfer rate β is analogous to the product of Source emission strength and Boundary Permeability.

        The medium between systems acts as a communication channel. The maximum rate of memetic transfer is bounded by the channel's capacity, where the signal (S) is the Source's echo strength and the noise (N) is a function of the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).

  disambiguation: |
    Memetic Transfer must be distinguished from **Structural Entrainment**, where a Target phase-locks to a Source's rhythm without replicating its complex information content (learning the beat vs. learning the song). It is also distinct from **Attention Capture**, which is a transient, low-information perturbation (hearing a loud noise vs. learning a language).

# Memetic Transfer

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A specific mode of Coherence Transfer wherein a high-information, complex Ki pattern (the meme) emitted by a Source system is successfully imprinted upon and replicated by a harmonically compatible Target system. The transfer is successful if the Target can subsequently emit the same pattern, demonstrating it has not merely been perturbed but has fundamentally updated its own coherence manifold. This process is the physical mechanism for the propagation of ideas, technologies, and cultural norms.

## EFT-First Summary
At a population level, Memetic Transfer can be conceptually mapped to epidemiological models (e.g., SIR models), where the propagation of a memetic pattern through a group of systems is treated like the spread of an infectious agent. The transfer rate is determined by system compatibility and properties of the intervening medium. At the individual level, the process is analogous to information transmission over a noisy channel, where the medium's state (Temporal Pressure) sets the effective signal-to-noise ratio, bounding the rate and fidelity of transfer.
