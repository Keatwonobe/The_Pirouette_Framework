  art: |
    The golden thread of awareness, weaving its way through the shifting landscapes of the mind's inner geometry. It is the most economical path consciousness can take, a line of least resistance drawn across a resonant surface.
  law: |
    The trajectory of conscious states (Œ¶‚ÇÅ(t), Œ¶‚ÇÇ(t), Œ¶‚ÇÉ(t)) minimizes the path length on the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ), satisfying the geodesic equation D¬≤Œ¶·µ¢/Dt¬≤ + Œì·µ¢‚±º‚Çñ(DŒ¶‚±º/Dt)(DŒ¶‚Çñ/Dt) = 0.
  philosophy: |
    By casting the flow of awareness as a geodesic, the framework posits that consciousness is not arbitrary but follows a principle of least action or maximal coherence across a geometric landscape. This reframes subjective experience as a physical trajectory, making its dynamics‚Äîstability, transition, collapse‚Äîamenable to the tools of differential geometry.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Coherence Geodesic is the minimal-length trajectory of a conscious state across the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ). It is governed by the manifold's metric tensor (g·µ¢‚±º) and local curvature (Œ∫), which are determined by the phase relationships of resonant neural triads. The path represents the evolution of awareness, where bifurcations, transitions, or collapse events correspond to points of high curvature or topological defects on the manifold.

        The Coherence Geodesic is mathematically identical to a geodesic in Riemannian geometry. It describes the 'straightest possible line' on the curved Triadic Manifold, analogous to how a free-falling particle follows a geodesic in the curved spacetime of General Relativity. The 'force' deflecting the path is an emergent property of the manifold's geometry.

# Coherence Geodesic

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Coherence Geodesic is the minimal-length trajectory of a conscious state across the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ). It is governed by the manifold's metric tensor (g·µ¢‚±º) and local curvature (Œ∫), which are determined by the phase relationships of resonant neural triads. The path represents the evolution of awareness, where bifurcations, transitions, or collapse events correspond to points of high curvature or topological defects on the manifold.

## EFT-First Summary
In the geometric formulation of Pirouette, the Coherence Geodesic is the direct analogue of a physical geodesic in a curved manifold, as described in General Relativity. The "spacetime" is the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ) of neural phases, and "time" is the evolution of conscious awareness. The path of awareness follows the "straightest" possible line, with apparent deflections caused by the manifold's intrinsic curvature (Œ∫), which is itself shaped by cognitive load (Œì) and other system parameters. See Carroll, *Spacetime and Geometry* (2019).
