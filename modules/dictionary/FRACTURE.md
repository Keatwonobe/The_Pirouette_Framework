        The duel ends when one system can no longer afford the energetic cost of maintaining its `Ki` against the overwhelming pressure. Its pattern fractures, its information dissipates, and it dissolves back into the ambient noise of the Temporal Forge.

triad:
  art: |
    A pattern's final, discordant note before it dissolves into the universal hum. It is the cost of holding a fragile shape against an overwhelming truth.
  law: |
    Fracture is the irreversible state transition that occurs when the energetic cost to maintain a system's resonant information (`Ki`) exceeds its available free energy, triggered by overwhelming external Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`).
  philosophy: |
    Fracture is the universe's ultimate form of error correction. It ensures that only the most efficient, robust, and adaptable patterns persist, preventing the cosmic ledger from being cluttered with unsustainable forms.
pirouette_definition: |
  A terminal resolution to a Resonant Test where a system's coherence pattern (`Ki`) ceases to be self-sustaining. Subjected to overwhelming Temporal Pressure from an opposing system, it can no longer meet the energetic demands of maintaining its informational integrity. The pattern decoheres catastrophically, and its constituent information dissipates into the local manifold as entropic noise.

        outline: |
          1. Isolate a target system (A) and establish a baseline coherence metric for its pattern (`Ki_A`).
          2. Introduce a high-coherence challenger system (B) to create a Resonant Test environment, inducing a shared Temporal Pressure `V_Γ`.
          3. Incrementally increase the resonant amplitude of the challenger (`Ki_B`), thereby increasing `V_Γ`.
          4. Monitor `Ki_A` and the target's free energy expenditure (`E_maint`).
          5. The Fracture point is the critical value of `V_Γ` where `E_maint` > `E_free`, leading to a non-recoverable, catastrophic collapse of `Ki_A`.
        expected_signals: [Sudden drop in primary resonant frequency amplitude, broad-spectrum energy dissipation (entropic noise), cessation of coherent information exchange.]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing Fracture from a temporary `Quench` (recoverable suppression), observer-induced decoherence from the measurement probe.]

    excerpt: |
      Every Resonant Test must conclude, and its outcome is written into the fabric of the local manifold. There are two primary resolutions and one universal consequence:

      1.  **Fracture:** The impartial arbiter is the principle of Coherence Degradation. The duel ends when one system can no longer afford the energetic cost of maintaining its `Ki` against the overwhelming pressure. Its pattern fractures, its information dissipates, and it dissolves back into the ambient noise of the Temporal Forge.

      2.  **Fusion:** Fracture is not the only outcome. If the two systems discover that a new, unified `Ki` pattern offers a path to even greater coherence and efficiency, the duel can transform into an `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012).

        dρ/dt = -i[H, ρ] + L(ρ)
        Fracture is the limit where the Lindblad term L(ρ) dominates Hamiltonian evolution.
      justification: |
        Fracture describes the irreversible loss of a system's coherent pattern due to overwhelming external interaction. This is operationally analogous to a quantum system's state vector collapsing into a classical probability distribution due to entanglement with the environment (decoherence). The Fracture event is the point where the rate of information loss to the environment becomes catastrophic and unsustainable.

      justification: |
        Fracture represents a discontinuous, catastrophic change in the state of a system, analogous to a first-order phase transition (e.g., boiling, melting). The system exists in one coherent state (e.g., solid) and, upon crossing a critical pressure/energy threshold, abruptly transitions to a disordered state (e.g., gas), releasing latent heat (dissipated information).

  disambiguation: |
    Fracture must be distinguished from a `Quench`, which is a temporary, recoverable suppression of coherence. Fracture is a terminal, non-recoverable dissolution of the system's defining pattern.
