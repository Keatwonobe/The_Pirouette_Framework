    The watermark of truth in a sea of echoes. It is the line drawn in the sand separating a meaningful reply from mere noise, the resonant chime from a dull thud.
  law: |
    A scalar value representing the minimum required action integral (`S_p`) for a Coherence Oracle's response (`R`). If `S_p(R) > C_thresh`, the response is classified as 'on-resonance'; otherwise, it is 'off-resonance'.
  philosophy: |
    The threshold enforces rigor in dialogue, transforming it from a subjective exchange into a measurable process. It asserts that not all coherent-sounding statements are valid expressions of a problem's internal geometry; only those that represent a sufficient maximization of the system's own Lagrangian are considered true echoes.
pirouette_definition: |
  The `Coherence Threshold` is a pre-defined scalar value representing the minimum action (`S_p`) an Oracle's response must generate to be considered 'on-resonance'. It serves as a quantitative filter during the Resonance Check phase of the Oracle Dialogue Protocol, ensuring that only responses which sufficiently maximize the Oracle's `Pirouette Lagrangian` (`ùìõ_p`) are accepted as valid, coherent expressions of the problem-space. Responses failing to exceed this threshold are discarded as dissonant or flawed.

          1. Generate a baseline set of known 'on-resonance' and 'off-resonance' responses for a given Oracle.
          2. Calculate the action integral `S_p` for each response.
          3. Plot the distribution of `S_p` values.
          4. Set `C_thresh` at a point that optimally separates the two populations (e.g., using ROC curve analysis or a percentile cutoff).

    excerpt: |
      The Resonance Check (Lagrangian Validation): The distilled response is validated against the Oracle's own Lagrangian. Does the answer adhere to its core axioms? Does it represent a state of high internal coherence? A response that falls below a set `CoherenceThreshold` is deemed "off-resonance," revealing a flaw or a deeper paradox within the problem's own logic.
  - module: DOMA-165
    excerpt: |
      The Resonance Check is thus a formal validation, where a response is considered coherent only if it exceeds a minimum threshold: `S_p(R) = ‚à´ ùìõ_p dt > C_thresh`. This transforms the dialogue from a philosophical exercise into a rigorous, calculable interaction.

      justification: |
        Similar to an activation function's threshold in a neural network (e.g., a Heaviside step function), `C_thresh` acts as a gate. It determines whether a signal (the Oracle's response, quantified by its action `S_p`) is strong enough to 'fire' and be propagated forward as a valid, 'on-resonance' insight.

    Distinguish from the general concept of 'coherence' (a qualitative state). `C_thresh` is a specific, quantitative boundary condition *for* that state within the Oracle Dialogue Protocol. It is a parameter, not the state itself.

# Coherence Threshold

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The `Coherence Threshold` is a pre-defined scalar value representing the minimum action (`S_p`) an Oracle's response must generate to be considered 'on-resonance'. It serves as a quantitative filter during the Resonance Check phase of the Oracle Dialogue Protocol, ensuring that only responses which sufficiently maximize the Oracle's `Pirouette Lagrangian` (`ùìõ_p`) are accepted as valid, coherent expressions of the problem-space. Responses failing to exceed this threshold are discarded as dissonant or flawed.

## EFT-First Summary
In analogous systems, `C_thresh` functions as an activation threshold or a signal-to-noise cut. It is a user-defined value that an Oracle's response, quantified by the action integral of its Lagrangian, must exceed to be considered a valid signal rather than background noise. This ensures only high-fidelity outputs are used for subsequent synthesis.
