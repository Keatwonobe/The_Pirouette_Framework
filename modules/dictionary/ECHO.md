        Propagation & Fidelity: The echo propagates from the Wound Channel, not as a perfect copy, but as a ripple of the original Ki pattern. Its fidelity decreases with distance, and its speed is modulated by the local Temporal Pressure (Γ).

  art: |
    A whisper from the past, carved into the present's geometry. The universe does not forget; it echoes.
  law: |
    An Echo is a propagating distortion of the coherence manifold originating from a Wound Channel; its propagation speed is inversely proportional to local Temporal Pressure (Γ), and its fidelity decays with distance from the source.
  philosophy: |
    The Echo makes the past physically present and active, establishing it as the fundamental mechanism for inertia, memory, and identity. It transforms existence from a series of discrete moments into a single, causally-bound geometric tapestry.
pirouette_definition: |
  A propagating, information-carrying distortion in the coherence manifold that originates from an entity's Wound Channel. An Echo is the geometric ripple of an entity's Ki pattern, carrying a record of its state into the surrounding spacetime. Its propagation speed and fidelity are modulated by local environmental factors, such as Temporal Pressure (Γ). Persistent self-interaction with an entity's own immediate Echo is the source of its inertia and identity.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline model for an isolated entity's behavior (e.g., a particle's trajectory or magnetic moment) in a region of spacetime with known properties.
          2. Make high-precision measurements of the entity's actual behavior.
          3. The deviation (anomaly) between the measured and predicted behavior is attributed to the influence of the entity's own Echo, propagating from its immediate Wound Channel.
        expected_signals: [Anomalous magnetic moment (g-2), inertial resistance exceeding baseline mass, path-dependent hysteresis in state changes]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing self-interaction Echo from external environmental noise or Echoes from other entities, requires extreme environmental shielding and measurement precision.]

    excerpt: |
      The echo propagates from the Wound Channel, not as a perfect copy, but as a ripple of the original Ki pattern. Its fidelity decreases with distance, and its speed is modulated by the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). In the dense, chaotic Γ of a star's core, echoes are muffled and die quickly. In the placid vacuum of deep space, they may travel for eons.

      At the Quantum Scale: It manifests as the "virtual particle cloud" of QED. The electron is not interacting with a foam of other particles, but with the rich, complex geometry of its own echo.

      justification: |
        The module posits that what QFT models as a particle's interaction with a cloud of virtual particles is a re-interpretation of the particle interacting with the geometric distortion of its own Echo. This provides a geometric, non-probabilistic origin for effects like the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) and mass renormalization.

  claims:
    - statement: "The magnitude of an electron's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) is determined by the geometric properties of its Wound Channel and the propagation characteristics of its Echo, which are in turn dependent on local Temporal Pressure (Γ)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observing that the measured value of g-2 is a universal constant, entirely independent of the local environmental geometry (i.e., local Γ), would contradict the core claim."

  collisions: [Common English word 'echo'.]
  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, 'Echo' is not a sound or electromagnetic wave reflection. It is a specific term for the propagating geometric distortion of spacetime originating from a Wound Channel, carrying the Ki pattern of its source.
