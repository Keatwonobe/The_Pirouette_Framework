        The engine operationalizes the framework's core law. It posits that all evolution is a form of geodesic search—a process by which a system discovers its path of maximal coherence through the landscape of spacetime.

  art: |
    Evolution is not a battlefield but a dance floor. The engine reveals the steps, a dance between the patient, local work of learning and the brave, non-local leap of synthesis. It is the choreographer's pen for the dance of becoming.
  law: |
    The Geodesic Engine models system evolution by computationally maximizing the action `S_p = ∫ (K_τ - V_Γ) dt`. It achieves this through a dual optimization strategy: continuous, local gradient ascent on the coherence manifold (learning) and discontinuous, non-local jumps between optima (synthesis/inheritance).
  philosophy: |
    This engine unifies all forms of adaptation—learning, cultural assimilation, genetic inheritance, physical dynamics—under a single predictive principle. It reframes evolution as an engineerable search for resonance, making destiny a computable trajectory.

  A universal simulation engine that operationalizes the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The Geodesic Engine models a system's evolution as a "geodesic search" for a trajectory of maximal Temporal Coherence (K_τ) within a simulated environment, the Crucible. It employs a dual-algorithm approach: 1) **Gradient Ascent**, a continuous, local optimization analogous to reinforcement learning, informed by the Wound Channel (CORE-011). 2) **Alchemical Leap**, a discontinuous, non-local jump across the coherence manifold, analogous to genetic crossover and implemented via Alchemical Union (CORE-012).

        outline: |
          1. **Define Crucible:** Specify the environment, its dynamics, and the corresponding Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) landscape.
          2. **Instantiate Weaver(s):** Initialize one or more entities with a starting internal pattern (Ki), e.g., a neural network with random weights.
          3. **Execute Search Loop:**
             a. For a set number of steps, allow the Weaver(s) to perform **Gradient Ascent**: interact with the Crucible, record outcomes in the Wound Channel, and update Ki to increase K_τ.
             b. Periodically, execute an **Alchemical Leap**: select high-performing Weavers and combine their patterns (Ki) to create a new generation of Weavers, which then replace low-performers.
          4. **Terminate & Analyze:** Halt on convergence or after a fixed time. The primary signal is the Weaver's final trajectory, which represents the computed geodesic.
        expected_signals: [Weaver trajectory, final K_τ value, Flow Dynamics state (Turbulent, Stagnant, Laminar)]
        pitfalls: [Premature convergence to a Stagnant Flow state (local optimum), selection of an unstable Alchemical Leap operator.]

    excerpt: |
      The Crucible is the arena of evolution, the temporal diorama where a simulation unfolds. It is any bounded system that defines a specific coherence manifold—a landscape of potential paths, characterized by its varying degrees of Temporal Pressure (V_Γ). This pressure landscape, which represents the "cost" of maintaining a pattern against ambient chaos, forms the stage for the dance of evolution.

    excerpt: |
      The Geodesic Engine is the living expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). Where the core module provides the universe's universal law of motion, this engine provides the computational instrument to solve it for complex systems where analytical solutions are impossible.
  - module: DOMA-083
    excerpt: |
      **Gradient Ascent** is the standard reinforcement learning loop, updating the policy based on the reward signal from the Wound Channel (replay buffer). Periodically, the engine performs an **Alchemical Leap**, taking the most successful Weavers and weaving their Wound Channels (network weights) together via "genetic crossover" to create a new, potentially superior generation.

        The Geodesic Engine formalizes a hybrid of RL and EA. Gradient Ascent is explicitly mapped to policy gradient RL, where the Pirouette Lagrangian acts as the reward function. The Alchemical Leap is explicitly mapped to the crossover operator in genetic algorithms, merging successful policies (Weavers).

    The Geodesic Engine is not a "physics engine" in the conventional sense (e.g., for graphics rendering). It is a universal *dynamics* engine for simulating the evolution of any system describable by the Pirouette Lagrangian, of which physical systems are a subset. Its primary output is not a rendered scene, but a trajectory of maximal coherence—a system's predicted path of evolution.

# Geodesic Engine

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A universal simulation engine that operationalizes the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The Geodesic Engine models a system's evolution as a "geodesic search" for a trajectory of maximal Temporal Coherence (K_τ) within a simulated environment, the Crucible. It employs a dual-algorithm approach: 1) **Gradient Ascent**, a continuous, local optimization analogous to reinforcement learning, informed by the Wound Channel (CORE-011). 2) **Alchemical Leap**, a discontinuous, non-local jump across the coherence manifold, analogous to genetic crossover and implemented via Alchemical Union (CORE-012).

## EFT-First Summary
The Geodesic Engine is a computational framework for finding optimal system trajectories, directly analogous to hybrid optimization algorithms that combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). It models a system's (a "Weaver's") learning process as an RL agent performing gradient ascent on a reward landscape defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian. To escape local optima and accelerate discovery, this learning process is punctuated by an EA-style crossover and selection step ("Alchemical Leap"), where the policies (internal patterns) of successful agents are merged to create a new generation. This provides a powerful, practical method for solving complex optimization problems by simulating a system's search for its most coherent state. For further details, see Sutton & Barto (2018) on RL and Eiben & Smith (2015) on EAs.
