    An observer claps, and the ripples from that choice lean a floating sail. The path of the clapping hands‚Äîapproaching and receding‚Äîleaves a memory in the water, an echo of a choice that became a map, and the map moved the sail.
  law: |
    A system under spatially asymmetric observation exhibits a hysteresis loop in its physical response (e.g., deflection Œîx) when the observation gain (g) is swept up and then down. The loop area, ùíú_g = ‚àÆ Œîx dg, must be non-zero, reproducible, and dependent on the observation geometry.
  philosophy: |
    The curve's existence reveals that the observer-system interaction is not instantaneous; it has memory. The system's state depends not just on the current observation strength, but on the history of that interaction, signifying the formation and dissolution of a shared observer-system manifold, or "agreement."
pirouette_definition: |
  A plot of a system's steady-state response (e.g., the deflection Œîx of an Observation Sail) versus a swept parameter of observation, typically the dimensionless gain `g`. The defining feature is a non-zero loop area, `ùíú_g = ‚àÆ Œîx dg`, when the gain is ramped from zero to a maximum value and back to zero. This hysteresis demonstrates a memory effect, where the observer-system state becomes "locked" into a specific geometry (the agreement), which persists on the downward sweep to a different gain value than where it formed. `ùíú_g` quantifies the work per cycle associated with forming and breaking this observer-system coherence.

        outline: |
          1. Apply an asymmetric observation geometry to a test system (e.g., an Observation Sail).
          2. Stabilize all other parameters (e.g., beam current). Zero the response metric (Œîx = 0 at g = 0).
          3. Slowly ramp the observation gain `g` from 0 to a maximum value `g_max`, continuously recording the steady-state system response Œîx.
          4. Immediately and at the same rate, ramp the gain `g` from `g_max` back to 0, again recording Œîx.
          5. Plot Œîx vs. g for both the up-ramp and down-ramp. The area enclosed by the two traces is ùíú_g.
        expected_signals: [A closed loop in the (g, Œîx) plane with statistically significant non-zero area.]
        pitfalls: [Thermal drift creating a false loop, mechanical backlash in actuators, sweep rate being too fast (non-adiabatic) leading to transient artifacts instead of true hysteresis.]

        Both the Agreement Curve and magnetic hysteresis plot a system's response (deflection Œîx / magnetization M) to an external driving field (observation gain g / magnetic field H). The non-zero loop area in both cases represents work done or energy dissipated per cycle and indicates a memory effect where the system's state depends on its history.

# Agreement Curve

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A plot of a system's steady-state response (e.g., the deflection Œîx of an Observation Sail) versus a swept parameter of observation, typically the dimensionless gain `g`. The defining feature is a non-zero loop area, `ùíú_g = ‚àÆ Œîx dg`, when the gain is ramped from zero to a maximum value and back to zero. This hysteresis demonstrates a memory effect, where the observer-system state becomes "locked" into a specific geometry (the agreement), which persists on the downward sweep to a different gain value than where it formed. `ùíú_g` quantifies the work per cycle associated with forming and breaking this observer-system coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
The Agreement Curve is a phenomenon conceptually analogous to magnetic or ferroelectric hysteresis in condensed matter physics. Just as a B-H curve plots magnetization (a system response) against an applied H-field (a driving force) and reveals memory and energy loss through its loop area, the Agreement Curve plots a physical response (e.g., momentum) against observation strength. The non-zero area signifies that information extraction and the resulting back-action perform work on the system in a path-dependent way, indicating the formation of a metastable, shared state between the observer and the system.
