  art: |
    A crystalline lattice woven into the fabric of the field, resisting abrupt contortions. It is the internal scaffolding that shelters a soliton's coherent core from the tremor of dissipation.
  law: |
    The inclusion of a pressuron stiffness term `L ⊃ λ(∂_μΓ ∂^μΓ)²` with coefficient `λ > 0` strictly enlarges the parameter space (e.g., range of charge `Q` or frequency `ω`) within which a soliton solution is classically stable, as measured by the condition `dQ/dω < 0`.
  philosophy: |
    This term exemplifies the principle that stable, complex structures often require more than minimal dynamics. Higher-order 'material properties' like stiffness are necessary to prevent them from collapsing, transitioning idealized models into more physically robust effective field theories.
pirouette_definition: |
  A higher-order kinetic term, `λ(∂_μΓ ∂^μΓ)²`, added to the Lagrangian for the real scalar field Γ. It penalizes large field gradients, effectively "stiffening" the field configuration against perturbations. Its primary function is to provide a non-linear pressure that supports solitonic solutions against collapse, thereby enlarging their window of classical stability beyond what is allowed by quadratic kinetic terms alone.

        outline: |
          1. Observationally or numerically characterize the stability window (e.g., the range of charge `Q` or mass) for a population of `(C, Γ)` solitons.
          2. Compute the theoretical stability window as a function of the stiffness coefficient `λ` using the Pirouette model, typically by solving the field equations and checking the `dQ/dω < 0` condition.
          3. Infer the value of `λ` by fitting the theoretical model to the observed data. A non-zero `λ` is required if the observed window is larger than the `λ=0` prediction.

      justification: |
        The Skyrme model uses a quartic derivative term to stabilize topological solitons (skyrmions) representing baryons, preventing their collapse as dictated by Derrick's theorem. The pressuron stiffness term plays the exact same role for the Γ-field, providing stability through a higher-order kinetic interaction.

# Pressuron stiffness

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A higher-order kinetic term, `λ(∂_μΓ ∂^μΓ)²`, added to the Lagrangian for the real scalar field Γ. It penalizes large field gradients, effectively "stiffening" the field configuration against perturbations. Its primary function is to provide a non-linear pressure that supports solitonic solutions against collapse, thereby enlarging their window of classical stability beyond what is allowed by quadratic kinetic terms alone.

## EFT-First Summary
Pressuron stiffness is a higher-dimension operator in the effective field theory of the Γ-field, proportional to `(∂Γ)⁴`. Such terms, often written as part of a `P(X)` Lagrangian where `X=(∂Γ)²`, are expected to arise from integrating out heavier physics. Its positive coefficient `λ` provides a stabilizing effect that prevents solitonic field configurations from collapsing, directly analogous to the Skyrme term that stabilizes baryons in nuclear physics. This mechanism is a key tool for building robust, particle-like solutions in field theory.
