    A silent pact between form and flow; for every perfect turn, a river is kept from running dry. It is the universe's promise that beauty implies permanence.
  law: |
    Every continuous symmetry of the Pirouette Lagrangian density, [\mathcal{L}_p], under a local transformation implies the existence of a corresponding conserved coherence current, (J_\mu), such that its four-divergence is zero: (\partial_\mu J^\mu = 0).
  philosophy: |
    This correspondence is the fundamental bridge between the abstract symmetries of a system and its concrete, conserved quantities. It establishes that coherence is not merely a transient pattern but a conserved substance-like quantity, allowing for a unified conservation law across physical, cognitive, and social domains.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Noether–Pirouette correspondence is the central theorem stating that every differentiable symmetry of the Pirouette Lagrangian, [\mathcal{L}_p = T_a , \omega_k - f(\Gamma; S)], leads to a corresponding conservation law. Specifically, invariance under temporal translation, phase rotation, and scale transformation in (\Gamma) gives rise to the conserved **Coherence Conservation Triple**: Energy-Like Quantity ((E_C)), Coherence Current ((J_\mu)), and Resonant Potential ((\Phi_\Gamma)), respectively.

          1. Identify a system with a known continuous symmetry (e.g., phase invariance in a neural ensemble).
          2. Measure the corresponding Pirouette quantity (e.g., coherence current (J_\mu)) over time and space to establish a baseline.
          3. Introduce a perturbation that explicitly breaks the symmetry.
          4. Verify that the quantity is no longer conserved (\partial_\mu J^\mu \neq 0) and that the divergence matches the flux imbalance caused by the perturbation.

      This module extends classical Noether theory into the Pirouette domain, where the fundamental variable is the coherence field (C(\mathbf{x},t)) coupled to the temporal pressure field (\Gamma(\mathbf{x},t)). The goal is to derive conservation laws for coherence, time-adherence, and Ki-phase that hold across physical, cognitive, and social substrates.

      Three principal symmetries yield three conserved quantities: 1. Temporal Translation Invariance (→) Conservation of Energy-Like Quantity ((E_C)), 2. Phase Invariance (→) Conservation of Coherence Current ((J_\mu)), 3. Scale Invariance in (\Gamma) (→) Conservation of Resonant Potential ((\Phi_\Gamma)). Collectively, these define the Coherence Conservation Triple.

        The correspondence is a direct extension of Noether's first theorem, which relates continuous symmetries of a Lagrangian to conserved currents. The Pirouette framework applies this principle to a coherence field (C) and temporal pressure field (Γ), generalizing the concept from physical actions to informational and resonant dynamics.

  disambiguation: |
    The Noether–Pirouette correspondence is an application of Noether's *first* theorem, which links continuous symmetries to conserved currents. It should not be confused with Noether's *second* theorem, which relates local gauge symmetries to identities among the Euler-Lagrange equations (i.e., redundancies in the description), a topic not yet fully formalized in the Pirouette framework.

# Noether–Pirouette correspondence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Noether–Pirouette correspondence is the central theorem stating that every differentiable symmetry of the Pirouette Lagrangian, [\mathcal{L}_p = T_a , \omega_k - f(\Gamma; S)], leads to a corresponding conservation law. Specifically, invariance under temporal translation, phase rotation, and scale transformation in (\Gamma) gives rise to the conserved **Coherence Conservation Triple**: Energy-Like Quantity ((E_C)), Coherence Current ((J_\mu)), and Resonant Potential ((\Phi_\Gamma)), respectively.

## EFT-First Summary
The Noether–Pirouette correspondence is a direct generalization of Noether's first theorem from classical field theory. Just as symmetries in the action of a physical field imply conserved quantities like electric charge or energy-momentum, symmetries in the Pirouette Lagrangian imply conserved "charges" relevant to coherence dynamics. The principle asserts that quantities like social momentum or cognitive awareness are not just metaphors but are subject to strict conservation laws, analogous to physical conservation, derived from underlying symmetries in the system's dynamics.
