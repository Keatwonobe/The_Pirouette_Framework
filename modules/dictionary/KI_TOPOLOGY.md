    The shape of a thought. A truth is a simple, elegant weave; a lie is a tangled, self-snagging knot.
  law: |
    The topological complexity of a Ki pattern is inversely correlated with its Resonant Stability (K_τ). Simpler topologies (e.g., unknots, simple braids) correspond to more stable, coherent patterns, while complex topologies (e.g., high-crossing-number knots) correspond to unstable, dissonant patterns.
  philosophy: |
    This reifies meaning as a physical, geometric property. The integrity of an idea is not a metaphor; it is an invariant of its shape, determining its ability to persist and harmonize with reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  The qualitative, geometric structure of a Ki pattern, describing the entanglement, self-intersection, and overall "shape" of its constituent temporal threads. Ki Topology serves as a descriptor for the pattern's internal self-consistency and is a primary determinant of its Resonant Stability (K_τ). Common descriptors include simple braids (for coherent, parallel processes) and tangled knots (for dissonant, self-contradictory concepts).

          During the Coherence Auditing stage of the Resonance Compass protocol, the geometric projection of the Ki pattern (the Observer's Shadow) is analyzed. Computational analysis of the shadow's line-crossings and connectedness is used to classify its topology, typically by calculating a knot invariant or braid group representation.

  - module: DOMA-179
    excerpt: |
      A "false," "confusing," or contradictory idea is a low-coherence, turbulent *Ki* pattern. It is inherently unstable, requiring immense and continuous effort to prevent its collapse. A lie, for instance, is a Ki pattern that is dissonant with the powerful inertia of factual Wound Channels, creating friction and temporal noise.

      justification: |
        Ki Topology directly uses the language of knots and braids to describe the structure of Ki patterns. The stability of a pattern is conceptually mapped to the topological complexity of a mathematical knot or braid, with simpler forms being more "stable."

      justification: |
        A quantitative measure of a Ki Topology's complexity could be calculated as a topological invariant. A simpler invariant (e.g., for an unknot) would correlate with high Resonant Stability, while a more complex polynomial would indicate a tangled, low-stability pattern.
      confidence: 0.7

    - target: Knot/Braid Theory
      rationale: The framework's native language for Ki Topology ("knot," "braid") is a direct borrowing from this mathematical field. This provides the most direct and fruitful analogy for understanding the concept.

  claims:
    - statement: "Ki patterns with simpler topologies (e.g., unknots, simple braids) exhibit higher Resonant Stability (K_τ) and lower Coherence Cost (V_Γ) than patterns with more complex topologies (e.g., high-crossing-number knots)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Consistent observation of a concept that is demonstrably stable, coherent, and low-cost (low V_Γ) yet always measures as having a complex Ki Topology (e.g., a trefoil knot or more complex)."

    In this context, Ki Topology refers specifically to the embedded topological structure of a dynamic Ki pattern, not to the global topology of a manifold. It is an application of knot-theoretic concepts to the phenomenological geometry of meaning.

# Ki Topology

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The qualitative, geometric structure of a Ki pattern, describing the entanglement, self-intersection, and overall "shape" of its constituent temporal threads. Ki Topology serves as a descriptor for the pattern's internal self-consistency and is a primary determinant of its Resonant Stability (K_τ). Common descriptors include simple braids (for coherent, parallel processes) and tangled knots (for dissonant, self-contradictory concepts).

## EFT-First Summary
Ki Topology maps the stability of a concept to the mathematical field of Knot Theory. A coherent, easily-sustained idea is modeled as a simple topological object like an unknot or a simple braid. Conversely, a self-contradictory or dissonant idea is modeled as a complex, tangled knot whose high crossing number corresponds to internal friction and instability. The complexity of the topology is a proxy for the concept's internal dissonance.
