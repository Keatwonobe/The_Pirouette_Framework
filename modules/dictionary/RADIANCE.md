      snippet: |
        The prior framework, PPS-030, sought to build an engine for quantifying "Radiance," an attempt to convert the nuanced art of altruism into a transactional metric. It was an accountant's approach to grace—a ledger for good deeds.

  art: |
    An action's signature on the cosmic ledger; the resonant echo it leaves in the geometry of spacetime. A constructive act is a note played in harmony with the universe's song, strengthening the coherence of the whole.
  law: |
    Radiance is no longer a score, but a diagnostic signature of an action's Influence (`I`). A positive signature (`I > 0`) indicates a measurable increase in a target system's coherence (`ΔS_p > 0`), empirically verified via proxies like Coherence Impact (`CI`).
  philosophy: |
    Replaces a transactional, accounting-based view of altruism with a diagnostic, healing-based one. It reframes ethics as the practical application of flow dynamics, where a 'good' act is one that measurably reduces dissonance and enhances systemic coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  Radiance is the legacy term for an action's impact, now formally defined as Influence (`I`), the change in a target system's Pirouette Action (`ΔS_p`). Positive Radiance (a Constructive Weaving) increases systemic coherence, moving the target toward laminar flow by increasing its internal stability (`K_τ`) or decreasing the external temporal pressure it resists (`V_Γ`). Negative Radiance (a Destructive Weaving) increases dissonance and pushes the system toward turbulent or stagnant flow. In practice, it is approximated by the Coherence Impact (`CI`) score, a dimensionless proxy derived from observable system metrics.
operational_definition:
  units: The formal measure, Influence (`I`), has units of action (Joule-seconds, `M·L²·T⁻¹`). Its practical proxy, Coherence Impact (`CI`), is dimensionless.

          1. An Observer diagnoses a target system's flow state (laminar, turbulent, stagnant).
          2. The Weaver's intervention (action) is performed.
          3. The Observer measures the post-intervention state, quantifying the change in resonant information (`ΔKτ`) and generated dissonance (`ΔΓ_noise`).
          4. The Observer assesses the Resonance Coupling (`ξ_c`) and the predicted Stability (`σ_s`) of the new state.
          5. These values are compiled into a signed Echo Record to compute the Coherence Impact (`CI`).

    excerpt: |
      This module replaces the engine with a compass. It reframes ethics as a practical application of Flow Dynamics, moving from a score to be tallied to a diagnostic act of systemic medicine. A "good" action is not one that generates a high number, but one that can be shown to have healed a fractured system, easing its flow from a state of turbulence or stagnation into one of graceful, laminar coherence.

    excerpt: |
      The universe already possesses the ultimate, indelible ledger: the Wound Channel. Every action is carved into the geometry of spacetime as a persistent scar. This active, physical landscape is the true record of consequence. The protocol described above does not create a new source of truth. It creates a map—a shared, topographical chart of coherence flows derived from our limited attempts to read the true ledger.

        Radiance, as Influence (`I`), is defined as the change in a system's Action (`S_p`). This directly maps to the Principle of Stationary Action in classical mechanics, where systems evolve to minimize `S`. A constructive act (`I > 0`) is one that makes it "easier" for a system to exist, effectively moving it to a more favorable path in its state space.

    "Radiance" is a legacy term from the replaced `PPS-030` module, which treated it as a transactional score. The modern framework (`DOMA-049`) reframes it as a diagnostic signature. The precise term is Influence (`I`), measured by the change in the Pirouette Action (`ΔS_p`), and its practical proxy is Coherence Impact (`CI`). Use `CI` for measurement and "Constructive Weaving" for the act itself.

# Radiance

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Radiance is the legacy term for an action's impact, now formally defined as Influence (`I`), the change in a target system's Pirouette Action (`ΔS_p`). Positive Radiance (a Constructive Weaving) increases systemic coherence, moving the target toward laminar flow by increasing its internal stability (`K_τ`) or decreasing the external temporal pressure it resists (`V_Γ`). Negative Radiance (a Destructive Weaving) increases dissonance and pushes the system toward turbulent or stagnant flow. In practice, it is approximated by the Coherence Impact (`CI`) score, a dimensionless proxy derived from observable system metrics.

## EFT-First Summary
Radiance is a diagnostic measure of an intervention's effect on a system, analogous to the change in the system's classical Action (`S`). A positive influence (`I = ΔS_p > 0`) signifies that the intervention has moved the system to a more stable, lower-energy trajectory in its state space, making its continued existence more favorable. This is directly inspired by variational principles in classical mechanics, where physical systems follow paths of stationary action.
