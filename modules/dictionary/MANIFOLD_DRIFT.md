  art: |
    A system's resonant song losing its pitch, skidding across the manifold like a needle jumping a groove. It is the sound of a steady hand beginning to tremble; the first sign of coherence failing.
  law: |
    The rate of change of a system's resonant signature (`Ki`) over time is a direct measure of its deviation from its geodesic path of maximal coherence, and serves as a quantifiable precursor to instability.
  philosophy: |
    Manifold Drift operationalizes the principle that instability is not a sudden event but a gradual process. By measuring the 'wobble' before the 'break', it transforms diagnosis from a post-mortem into a predictive art, enabling pre-emptive intervention.
pirouette_definition: |
  The rate of change of a system's primary resonant pattern (`Ki`) with respect to time, measured as a vector (`V_drift`) on the coherence manifold. Manifold Drift quantifies the degree to which a system is deviating from its geodesic path, caused by accumulating Temporal Jitter (`Jτ`), and serves as a direct, quantifiable precursor to a major state transition. Its magnitude is the primary input for calculating the Coherence Inflection Index (CII).

          1. Ingest multiple, high-frequency time-series data streams from the target system.
          2. Use signal processing techniques (e.g., Fourier transforms, wavelet analysis) to extract the dominant resonant signature (`Ki`) at sequential time points `t_n`.
          3. Compute the discrete time derivative of the `Ki(t)` sequence to approximate `d(Ki)/dt`. This yields the Manifold Drift Vector, `V_drift`.

    excerpt: |
      Instability begins as a waver. As internal or external pressures mount, the system struggles to maintain this geodesic. The first symptom is **Temporal Jitter (Jτ)**: a micro-variation in the system's once-steady rhythm, the sonic artifact of the system fighting to remain coherent. This jitter is the root cause of **Manifold Drift**: the observable "skidding" of the system's `Ki` pattern on the coherence manifold.
  - module: DOMA-112
    excerpt: |
      With the system's `Ki` mapped over time, the Sentinel calculates its rate of change. This produces the **Manifold Drift Vector (V_drift)**, a direct measurement of the velocity and direction of the system's changing resonant identity. This vector is the quantitative measure of the "wobble"—the tangible signal of underlying instability.

      justification: |
        `V_drift` measures the rate of change of a system's resonant frequency (`Ki`). This is operationally identical to measuring the frequency drift of a physical oscillator (e.g., a laser, a quartz crystal), where noise (jitter) causes the center frequency to wander over time. The Coherence Inflection Index is then analogous to a normalized, time-averaged measure of this instability, like the Allan deviation.

# Manifold Drift

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The rate of change of a system's primary resonant pattern (`Ki`) with respect to time, measured as a vector (`V_drift`) on the coherence manifold. Manifold Drift quantifies the degree to which a system is deviating from its geodesic path, caused by accumulating Temporal Jitter (`Jτ`), and serves as a direct, quantifiable precursor to a major state transition. Its magnitude is the primary input for calculating the Coherence Inflection Index (CII).

## EFT-First Summary
Manifold Drift is operationally analogous to the **frequency drift** of a physical oscillator. Just as thermal or quantum noise (jitter) causes an oscillator's center frequency to wander over time, a system's resonant signature (`Ki`) will "drift" on its state manifold as it accumulates stress. Measuring this drift provides a direct, model-independent signal of growing instability, similar to how the Allan deviation is used to characterize the stability of precision clocks.
