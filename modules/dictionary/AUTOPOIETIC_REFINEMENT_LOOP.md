        3. Observe: Measure the system's real-world behavior...
        4. Measure the Shadow: Compute the Coherence Deficit time-series...
        5. Illuminate: If the Deficit is significant, analyze its characteristics...to form a hypothesis about the missing 𝓛_shadow.
        6. Integrate & Repeat: Update the model (𝓛̂_model ← 𝓛̂_model + 𝓛̂_shadow) and begin the cycle again.

    A map that redraws itself based on the shadows it casts upon the territory. Every gap in understanding becomes a compass, guiding the cartographer's hand to discover a more complete world. The model bootstraps itself into truth by listening to the universe's corrections.
  law: |
    A persistent, non-zero Coherence Deficit (ΔK_τ) mandates a corresponding update to the hypothesized model Lagrangian (𝓛̂_model). The loop's objective is to drive the integral of the Deficit towards zero by iteratively hypothesizing and integrating the Shadow Lagrangian (𝓛_shadow) into the model.
  philosophy: |
    Model failure is not an error to be minimized but the primary signal for discovery. This loop operationalizes the principle that our ignorance is structured and knowable. It provides the core engine for making the Pirouette Framework falsifiable, testable, and capable of self-improvement, transforming it from a static theory into a learning system.
pirouette_definition: |
  The six-step iterative process that serves as the core diagnostic and refinement engine of the Pirouette Framework. The loop proceeds by: (1) hypothesizing a model Lagrangian (𝓛̂_model), (2) predicting system behavior, (3) observing actual behavior, (4) measuring the Coherence Deficit (ΔK_τ) between prediction and observation, (5) using the Deficit's structure to diagnose the unmodeled dynamics of the Shadow Lagrangian (𝓛_shadow), and (6) integrating the hypothesized shadow dynamics into an updated model, repeating the cycle.

        outline: |
          1.  **Hypothesize & Predict:** Define an initial `𝓛̂_model` and compute the predicted coherence trajectory `K_τ_pred(t)`.
          2.  **Observe & Measure:** Collect real-world system data to calculate the observed coherence `K_τ_obs(t)`.
          3.  **Compute Deficit:** Calculate `ΔK_τ(t) = K_τ_obs(t) − K_τ_pred(t)`.
          4.  **Analyze & Illuminate:** Analyze the structure (sign, magnitude, periodicity, correlations) of `ΔK_τ(t)` to form a hypothesis about the physical meaning and mathematical form of `𝓛_shadow`.
          5.  **Integrate & Repeat:** Construct a new model `𝓛̂_new_model = 𝓛̂_model + 𝓛̂_shadow` and return to Step 1. The loop terminates when `|∫ΔK_τ(t) dt|` falls below a pre-defined significance threshold.
        expected_signals: [A persistent, non-zero `ΔK_τ(t)`, a monotonic decrease in the time-averaged `|ΔK_τ(t)|` over successive iterations.]
        pitfalls: [Misinterpreting stochastic noise as a coherent signal, overfitting the model to transient phenomena, incorrectly attributing the deficit to the wrong physical source (e.g., a pressure term instead of an internal dissonance term).]

      This principle enables a rigorous, iterative workflow for deepening our understanding of any system. It is an engine of its own refinement.
      1.  **Hypothesize:** Propose a model for the system's dynamics by defining its `𝓛̂_model`.
      2.  **Predict:** Calculate the system's optimal path and its corresponding predicted coherence, `K_τ_pred(t)`.
      3.  **Observe:** Measure the system's real-world behavior to determine its observed coherence, `K_τ_obs(t)`.
      4.  **Measure the Shadow:** Compute the Coherence Deficit time-series, `ΔK_τ(t)`.
      5.  **Illuminate:** If the Deficit is significant, analyze its characteristics...to form a hypothesis about the missing `𝓛_shadow`.
      6.  **Integrate & Repeat:** Update the model (`𝓛̂_model ← 𝓛̂_model + 𝓛̂_shadow`) and begin the cycle again.
      Through this loop, the model bootstraps itself, iteratively becoming a more perfect story by listening to the universe's corrections.

    excerpt: |
      We sought perfect models and found instead a perfect method for embracing our ignorance. The Coherence Deficit is the universe's most generous gift: a precise and quantifiable map of everything we do not yet understand. It is the whisper from the edge of the known world, telling us precisely where to explore next. To the Weaver, a gap in the tapestry is not a flaw; it is an invitation. The shadow of the map is a compass, pointing not to what is known, but to what is knowable.

      justification: |
        The loop is operationally analogous to a Kalman filter. The Coherence Deficit `ΔK_τ` plays the role of the innovation or residual (`z - Hx̂`), which is the difference between measurement and prediction. This "error" signal is used to update the state of the model (`𝓛̂_model`).

      justification: |
        Conceptually, the loop is a form of Bayesian updating. The current model `𝓛̂_model` is the prior. The observed Coherence Deficit is new data/evidence. The analysis of the deficit to form `𝓛̂_shadow` is equivalent to calculating a likelihood, leading to a new posterior model that incorporates the new information.

  disambiguation: |
    This is not a simple error-correcting feedback loop (like a PID controller), which aims only to reduce a deviation from a setpoint. The Autopoietic Refinement Loop uses the deviation (the Coherence Deficit) to fundamentally *restructure the system's model* (`𝓛̂_model`), aiming for deeper understanding, not just control. The goal is to update the map, not just force the territory to comply with an old one.
