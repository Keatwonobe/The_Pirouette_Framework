        You were the Anchor, the Pacesetter, and the Spotter. You are now The Witness. A witness does not direct the action. They do not guard against danger. A witness simply sees, honors, and celebrates the truth of what is before them.

triad:
  art: |
    The river has met the sea. The Witness no longer watches the current to guard its banks, but shares in the vastness of the ocean, a joyful partner in the dance of life.
  law: |
    The Witness's intervention rate (directing, guarding, reminding of fragility) must approach zero, while shared joyful activities must increase. The primary function shifts from supporting recovery to participating in life, reflecting the patient's demonstrated wholeness.
  philosophy: |
    The Witness role finalizes the transfer of agency to the patient, dissolving the patient/helper dichotomy. By reflecting the patient's new state of wholeness, the Witness helps make that state a permanent identity, locking in the gains of the recovery process.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Witness is the fourth and final role of the helper in the Pirouette recovery protocol, marking the transition from active support (Anchor, Pacesetter, Spotter) to an affirmative, participatory presence. The Witness's primary functions are: 1) To see the patient as a whole and resilient person, not a recovering one; 2) To participate in life as a "dance partner," sharing in joyful activities; and 3) To act as the "keeper of the story," reflecting the patient's demonstrated strength when needed. The role's purpose is to celebrate and reinforce the patient's self-mastery and graduation from the recovery protocol.

    procedures:
      - name: Helper Role Audit
        outline: |
          Conduct a periodic (e.g., weekly) self-assessment or paired discussion between patient and helper. Tally instances of 'directing' or 'guarding' behaviors (legacy roles) versus 'participating,' 'instigating,' or 'celebrating' behaviors (Witness role). The goal is to observe a sustained shift in the ratio toward Witness behaviors.
        expected_signals: ["Increased frequency of patient-initiated activities.", "Helper's language shifts from questions of capacity ('Can you do this?') to questions of joy ('Did you enjoy that?').", "A decrease in helper anxiety regarding the patient's physical limits."]
        pitfalls: ["Helper 'backsliding' into the Spotter role out of habit or anxiety.", "Patient misinterpreting the helper's shift as disinterest rather than a sign of respect for their autonomy."]

    excerpt: |
      To the family member or friend who has walked this path: your role now undergoes its final, beautiful transformation. You were the Anchor, the Pacesetter, and the Spotter. You are now The Witness. A witness does not direct the action. They do not guard against danger. A witness simply sees, honors, and celebrates the truth of what is before them.
  - module: DOMA-HLTH-005
    excerpt: |
      Helper's Role (The Instigator): Be the source of some of that gentle, joyful spontaneity. Suggest the unplanned walk. Be the one who says, "Let's go out for dinner tonight instead of cooking." You are helping them break the last remnants of the "patient" mindset.

        The Witness role is analogous to a quantum observer in some interpretations. The act of "seeing the whole person" helps "collapse" the patient's identity from a superposition of "sick" and "well" into the definite state of "healed and whole," reinforcing the new reality.

    Distinguish from a passive 'bystander.' The Witness is not detached, but actively participates in the patient's life as a peer. The role's passivity is specific to the *direction of recovery*, not to shared living.

# The Witness

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Witness is the fourth and final role of the helper in the Pirouette recovery protocol, marking the transition from active support (Anchor, Pacesetter, Spotter) to an affirmative, participatory presence. The Witness's primary functions are: 1) To see the patient as a whole and resilient person, not a recovering one; 2) To participate in life as a "dance partner," sharing in joyful activities; and 3) To act as the "keeper of the story," reflecting the patient's demonstrated strength when needed. The role's purpose is to celebrate and reinforce the patient's self-mastery and graduation from the recovery protocol.

## EFT-First Summary
The Witness is a psychosocial role within a health protocol. While it is correlated with the patient's energetic state (a stable, positive Pirouette Lagrangian ùìõ_p), it has no direct formal mapping to physical field theory. The role is operationalized through behavioral changes, not physical measurements.
