    The heft of a particle is not its own, but the echo of time's ripple, the tension in its own connection, and the twisting of its inner-space charge. Mass is the shadow cast by geometry.
  law: |
    The total invariant $\mathfrak{M}^2$, from which all inertial masses are derived, is the sum of the squared Γ-stiffness, the Ki-fiber curvature density, and the τ-substrate Ricci scalar, each scaled by the effective gravitational coupling.
  philosophy: |
    The Unified Invariant completes the geometrization of mass, asserting that inertia is not an intrinsic property of matter but a composite measure of spacetime's geometric and elastic properties. It provides a common origin for the Equivalence Principle, the mass-charge correlation, and the cosmological constant.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Unified Invariant ($\mathfrak{M}^2$) is a scalar quantity, invariant under τ-isometries, defined as the sum of three geometric terms: (1) the squared local stiffness of the coherence field ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2$), (2) the trace of the squared Ki-fiber field strength tensor ($\mathrm{Tr}(F^2)$), and (3) the Ricci scalar of the temporal substrate ($\mathcal{R}_\tau$). The latter two terms are scaled by the inverse effective gravitational coupling ($1/(8\pi G_{\text{eff}})$). This invariant represents the total curvature density from which the mass of any particle or field excitation is derived.
  \[
  \mathfrak{M}^2 = \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 + \frac{\mathrm{Tr}(F^2)}{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}} + \frac{\mathcal{R}_\tau}{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}}

          Measure particle rest masses at different energy scales ($\Lambda$) via scattering experiments. The logarithmic running of mass, as predicted by the RG flow linking $\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2$ and $\mathrm{Tr}(F^2)$, provides an indirect measurement of the components of $\mathfrak{M}^2$.

    excerpt: |
      We extend this by identifying the total invariant $\mathcal{M}^2 = \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 + \frac{\mathcal{R}_\tau}{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}}$, where $G_{\text{eff}}^{-1}=8\pi K_\Gamma$ acts as an emergent gravitational coupling. In regions of uniform curvature ($\mathcal{R}_\tau=0$), mass arises solely from stiffness; in curved regions, curvature contributes additively.
  - module: XAP-006D
    excerpt: |
      Inertial and gravitational masses coincide because both arise from the same invariant $\mathfrak{M}$. Particles with larger fiber curvature (stronger coupling) possess higher stiffness-derived mass. As curvature renormalizes with energy, rest masses should shift logarithmically—an avenue for precision tests in high-energy scattering.

# Unified Invariant

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Unified Invariant ($\mathfrak{M}^2$) is a scalar quantity, invariant under τ-isometries, defined as the sum of three geometric terms: (1) the squared local stiffness of the coherence field ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2$), (2) the trace of the squared Ki-fiber field strength tensor ($\mathrm{Tr}(F^2)$), and (3) the Ricci scalar of the temporal substrate ($\mathcal{R}_\tau$). The latter two terms are scaled by the inverse effective gravitational coupling ($1/(8\pi G_{\text{eff}})$). This invariant represents the total curvature density from which the mass of any particle or field excitation is derived.
\[
\mathfrak{M}^2 = \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 + \frac{\mathrm{Tr}(F^2)}{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}} + \frac{\mathcal{R}_\tau}{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}}
\]

## EFT-First Summary
The Unified Invariant $\mathfrak{M}^2$ corresponds to a geometrization of mass and energy density terms in the Standard Model and General Relativity. It proposes that scalar mass from Higgs-like Γ-stiffness, gauge field energy density from Ki-fiber curvature ($\mathrm{Tr}(F^2)$), and spacetime curvature from the Ricci scalar ($R$) are not independent but are components of a single, underlying geometric invariant. This provides a unified origin for inertial mass, gravitational mass, and field energy.
