      snippet: |
        The Higgs field (H) is the **complex bi-fundamental aligner** of the SU(2)(_L) temporal triad and the U(1)(_Y) clock; its potential ... arises from the **competition** between (i) *frame-alignment energy* (positive curvature) and (ii) *temporal-pressure softening* from Γ (negative curvature).

  art: |
    In Pirouette, the Higgs is not an add-on—it’s how time chooses a key. The Γ sea softens the scale, the triad and clock tune the chords, and the potential’s brim appears when the instrument decides to play. The Mexican hat is the geometry of that decision.
  law: |
    The quadratic curvature `α(Γ)` of the Higgs potential is determined by the competition between positive bare frame stiffness `α₀` and negative softening from temporal pressure `⟨Γ²⟩`. When `α(Γ)` crosses below zero, a phase transition occurs, yielding a non-zero vacuum expectation value `v² = -α(Γ) / (2β)`.
  philosophy: |
    The Higgs field is not a fundamental entity but an emergent order parameter. Its existence and potential shape are necessary consequences of the dynamics of temporal frames, resolving the tension between their intrinsic stiffness and the softening pressure exerted by the Γ-field.

        outline: |
          Infer the parameters of the Higgs potential `V(H)` by measuring the masses of the W and Z bosons (`m_W`, `m_Z`), the Higgs boson mass (`m_H`), and the Higgs trilinear self-coupling (`λ_3`) via di-Higgs production at colliders. These measurements determine `v`, `β`, and the effective value of `α(Γ)`.
        expected_signals: [`m_H` ≈ 125 GeV, `v` ≈ 246 GeV, percent-level deviations in `λ_3` correlated with `Γ_H` and `sin²θ_W`]

    excerpt: |
      Couple the aligner to Γ as required by Pirouette symmetry (pressure–density cross-term): `L_int = λHΓ(H†H)Γ²`. Here `α₀ ∝ k_eff > 0` encodes the bare alignment stiffness; the Γ background **reduces** curvature. When `⟨Γ²⟩` exceeds a threshold, `α(Γ_c) = 0`, which is the bifurcation point where the Mexican hat forms.

    excerpt: |
      Pirouette predicts **percent-level deviations** [in Higgs self-couplings] tied to `λHΓ` and the frame stiffnesses `K₁,₂`: `Δλ₃,₄ / λ₃,₄ ~ O(λHΓ⟨Γ²⟩/ω_c²) ≲ 10⁻²`. This provides a sharp, falsifiable target for the HL-LHC and future circular colliders.

        Pirouette's `H` is a complex SU(2)L doublet with a potential that produces spontaneous symmetry breaking, giving mass to W/Z bosons. It reproduces the SM Higgs mechanism identically, but derives the potential parameters `μ² = -α(Γ)` and `λ = β` from the dynamics of temporal frames (`K₁, K₂`) and pressure (`Γ`).

    In Pirouette, the Higgs field is an emergent order parameter for triad–clock alignment, not a fundamental scalar postulated ad-hoc. Its potential `V(H)` is a derived quantity determined by frame stiffness and temporal pressure, unlike in the SM where it is a fundamental input.

# Higgs field

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A complex, bi-fundamental order parameter `H` that measures and mediates the alignment between the SU(2)L temporal triad and the U(1)Y clock. Its potential `V(H)` is dynamically generated by the competition between the intrinsic stiffness of the temporal frames (positive curvature, `α₀`) and a softening pressure from the Γ-field (negative curvature, `-λHΓ⟨Γ²⟩`), causing a symmetry-breaking condensation `⟨H⟩ ≠ 0` when the softening term dominates.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette Framework models the Standard Model Higgs field as an order parameter describing the alignment of two internal 'temporal' frames, SU(2)L and U(1)Y. The effective potential for this field is dynamically generated. The quadratic term `μ²` is sourced by a competition between the frames' intrinsic stiffness (a positive `m²` term) and a 'temporal pressure' field `Γ` (a negative `m²` contribution). Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the pressure term dominates, `μ² > 0`, fixing the electroweak scale `v`. The quartic coupling `λ` arises from anharmonicities in the alignment energy. This model makes specific, correlated predictions for deviations in the Higgs self-coupling and the weak mixing angle.
