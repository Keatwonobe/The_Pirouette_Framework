        Axis Starvation (*K*p → 0): Stagnation. The system becomes rigid, dogmatic, and incapable of adaptation. It loses its quantum nature and collapses into a state of Stagnant Flow, a crystal doomed to shatter when its environment changes.

  art: |
    A chord of being collapses into a dissonant drone when one of its three notes fades to silence. The harmony of life, balanced between memory, action, and hope, falters and breaks. A three-legged stool cannot stand on two.
  law: |
    A system is in a state of Axis Starvation when the magnitude of any one of its three coherence components (*K*p, *K*i, *K*r) drops below a stability threshold, empirically determined as < 10% of the vector's L2 norm, |**K**τ|, for a sustained period. This condition invariably leads to a predictable mode of decoherence (Stagnation, Isolation, or Amnesia).
  philosophy: |
    Axis Starvation demonstrates that vitality is not a quantity but a dynamic balance. A system's failure mode is predetermined by which temporal "sense" it loses—its connection to the past, its engagement with the present, or its grasp of the future. This transforms pathology from a mere breakdown into a meaningful, diagnosable imbalance in a system's relationship with time.
pirouette_definition: |
  Axis Starvation is a pathological condition in which one of the three orthogonal components of the Temporal Coherence vector (**K**τ) approaches zero. This imbalance destabilizes a system's temporal posture, leading to one of three specific failure modes: Stagnation (*K*p → 0), Isolation (*K*i → 0), or Amnesia (*K*r → 0). The condition represents a loss of resonance along a fundamental temporal axis, crippling the system's ability to maintain a harmonious and adaptive existence.

          1. Establish a baseline coherence vector **K**τ for the system under stable conditions using tripartite probes (e.g., historical analysis for *K*r, network activity for *K*i, scenario modeling for *K*p).
          2. Monitor the components over time.
          3. Identify a persistent state where the ratio of one component's magnitude to the vector norm (e.g., |*K*j| / ||**K**τ||₂) falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 0.1).
          4. Correlate this state with the onset of predicted pathological behaviors (rigidity, non-responsiveness, or pattern loss).

        Axis Starvation mirrors the behavior of a multi-variable dynamical system where stability depends on the non-zero contribution of all state variables. When one variable is 'starved' (driven to zero by external forces or internal decay), the system can exit its stable manifold and transition to a pathological state, such as a chaotic attractor or a fixed point at infinity.

# Axis Starvation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Axis Starvation is a pathological condition in which one of the three orthogonal components of the Temporal Coherence vector (**K**τ) approaches zero. This imbalance destabilizes a system's temporal posture, leading to one of three specific failure modes: Stagnation (*K*p → 0), Isolation (*K*i → 0), or Amnesia (*K*r → 0). The condition represents a loss of resonance along a fundamental temporal axis, crippling the system's ability to maintain a harmonious and adaptive existence.

## EFT-First Summary
This entry does not yet have an adopted formal mapping. A candidate conceptual mapping exists to the loss of stability in a multi-component dynamical system, where a state variable approaching zero causes the system to exit a stable manifold.
