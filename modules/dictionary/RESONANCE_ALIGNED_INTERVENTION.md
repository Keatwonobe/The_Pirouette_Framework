  art: |
    To calm a swirling vortex, one does not fight the storm but finds the still point where a single touch can restore the flow. It is the art of social acupuncture, applying minimal force at the point of maximum leverage.
  law: |
    An intervention is resonance-aligned if its placement radius `r_p` maximizes the coherence energy restored (`ΔE_coh`) per unit of resource expended (`R`), satisfying `d/dr (ΔE_coh / R) |_{r=r_p} = 0`. Empirically, this optimum is found at or near the coherence core boundary `r_c`.
  philosophy: |
    The principle rejects brute-force solutions, asserting that systemic health is restored not by the magnitude of an intervention, but by its precise attunement to the system's underlying geometry and dynamics. Efficiency and elegance are paramount to sustainable governance.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Resonance-aligned Intervention is a policy or action applied at a specific spatio-temporal radius (`r_p`) within a social dissonance field, calculated to maximize the rate of coherence flux recovery per unit of resource expenditure. This optimal radius `r_p` is empirically found near the coherence core boundary (`r_c`) and is identified by the condition that minimizes systemic expenditure while resolving antagonistic curl (`∇ × A`) below the Curl Threshold (`Θ_c`).

      justification: |
        The search for `r_p` is analogous to finding an optimal control input `u(t)` (here, the placement of the intervention) that minimizes a cost function (resource expenditure `R`) while maximizing a desired state change (coherence restoration `ΔE_coh`). It frames governance as a dynamic optimization problem over a social field.

        Just as impedance matching maximizes power transfer between a source and a load by minimizing reflection, resonance-aligned intervention maximizes 'coherence transfer' from the policy action to the social system by matching the intervention's placement to the system's dynamic geometry, thus minimizing wasted effort or 'reflected' impact.

  disambiguation: |
    This concept is distinct from a 'brute-force intervention', which focuses on resource magnitude (`R`) rather than placement efficiency, and from 'harmonic intervention', which focuses on temporal frequency rather than spatial radius. Resonance alignment is fundamentally about geometric placement for optimal leverage.

# Resonance-aligned Intervention

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Resonance-aligned Intervention is a policy or action applied at a specific spatio-temporal radius (`r_p`) within a social dissonance field, calculated to maximize the rate of coherence flux recovery per unit of resource expenditure. This optimal radius `r_p` is empirically found near the coherence core boundary (`r_c`) and is identified by the condition that minimizes systemic expenditure while resolving antagonistic curl (`∇ × A`) below the Curl Threshold (`Θ_c`).

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, this intervention maps to an **Optimal Control Input** in control theory. The goal is to identify a specific placement for an action that minimizes a cost function (resource expenditure) while maximizing a desired change in the system's state (restoration of coherence). By framing governance as an optimization problem over a social field, it seeks the most efficient point of leverage rather than applying overwhelming force.
