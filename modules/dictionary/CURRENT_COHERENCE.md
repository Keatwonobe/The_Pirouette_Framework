        - **Current Coherence (`KœÑ`):** Identify the stable, resonant patterns of your life. What activities, relationships, and states of being generate flow, joy, and purpose?

    The deep, steady hum of the river you are in; the music of your daily life when it aligns with itself.
  law: |
    Current Coherence is the time-averaged integral of an individual's engagement in activities that produce states of flow, purpose, and psychological resonance, measured against their own baseline.
  philosophy: |
    `KœÑ` is the phenomenological reality of a life that 'works.' It is not an objective measure of success, but the subjective experience of a self-system in a stable, self-reinforcing, and meaningful pattern.
pirouette_definition: |
  Current Coherence (`KœÑ`) is the measure of stable, self-reinforcing patterns of activity, relationship, and being that constitute an individual's present life. It is the phenomenological counterpart to the kinetic term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`), representing the degree to which one's daily rhythms (`Ki`) generate states of flow, purpose, and psychological resonance. High `KœÑ` indicates a life path that is a strong, deep channel on the Personal Coherence Manifold.

        outline: |
          1. Inventory major life domains (e.g., work, relationships, hobbies).
          2. For a set period (e.g., 1-2 weeks), log significant activities within these domains.
          3. For each logged activity, rate the subjective experience on scales of Flow (1-10), Purpose (1-10), and psychological Resonance (1-10).
          4. `KœÑ` is established as the weighted average of these scores over the measurement period, creating a personal coherence baseline.
        expected_signals: [Consistent high scores in specific activities, periodic peaks in 'flow states', subjective reports of life satisfaction]
        pitfalls: [Recall bias, conflating pleasure with coherence (e.g., passive entertainment vs. active engagement), hedonic adaptation]

    excerpt: |
      First, establish a baseline by mapping the river you are in. This defines your "you are here" on the personal map.
      -   **Current Coherence (`KœÑ`):** Identify the stable, resonant patterns of your life. What activities, relationships, and states of being generate flow, joy, and purpose?
      -   **Ambient Pressure (`Œì`):** Identify the external and internal pressures that shape and constrain this life.
  - module: DOMA-166
    excerpt: |
      An individual's **current life path** is a trajectory that has found a stable local maximum for the integral of `ùìõ_p`, balancing familiar coherence (`K_œÑ`) against known pressures (`V_Œì`).

        L = T - V
      justification: |
        The module `DOMA-166` explicitly models the Pirouette Lagrangian as `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`, making `KœÑ` the direct analogue of the kinetic term. It represents the integrated "energy of motion" of one's life path, contrasted against the potential energy of external pressures (`V_Œì`).

          date: 2002-01-01
      confidence: 0.9
  adopted:
    - target: Kinetic Energy (`T`)
      rationale: The term's function in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`) is a one-to-one conceptual mapping to the role of kinetic energy in the classical Lagrangian, representing the "energy" of the current, realized state.
      confidence: 0.9
constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A sustained, targeted increase in `KœÑ`-generating activities leads to a measurable decrease in the perceived magnitude of ambient Temporal Pressure (`Œì`)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "No statistically significant negative correlation is found between changes in `KœÑ` and `Œì` over a 6-month period, as measured by resonant journaling and standard psychometrics (e.g., PSS, SWLS)."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [`K` is a common symbol for kinetic energy, which is an intentional parallel.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from `Ki`, the instantaneous pattern of activity. `KœÑ` is the integrated, time-averaged measure of the coherence produced *by* the `Ki` pattern over a specific duration (`œÑ`). `KœÑ` is a property of the path; `Ki` is the velocity along it.
