        The framework discovers itself through iterative correspondence-finding.
        Each imperfect mapping generates residue—a "should fit but doesn't" tension
        that naturally points toward the next layer of structure. This is not error
        to be eliminated but fuel to be refined.

      snippet: |
        The intelligence pump is like a piston engine: imperfect correspondence creates
        pressure differential; residual tension drives the next stroke; each cycle
        tightens fit while revealing deeper structure. The pump requires shallow depth
        (2-3 terms) and visible gaps to function. It's optimized for maximal learning
        rate, not minimal error.

triad:
  art: |
    A fractal fuse that ignites consistently. Each spark of mismatch lights the next
    inquiry. The pump lives at the edge where pattern meets novelty—constrained enough
    to grasp, open enough to pull you forward. Like getting out of a traffic jam by
    refusing to brake, only accelerating through the gaps.
  law: |
    An intelligence pump operates when: (1) correspondence between levels is imperfect
    but measurable, (2) residual mismatch is sufficient to generate obvious next inquiry,
    (3) barrier to next stroke is shallow (≤3 terms), (4) each cycle decreases gap
    while increasing structural depth, and (5) perfect fit is never reached, maintaining
    generative tension.
  philosophy: |
    The pump elevates mismatch from failure state to fuel source. Unlike traditional
    theory-building that seeks to eliminate all gaps, the pump optimizes for productive
    residue—just enough surprise to be learnable. This creates a self-sustaining cycle
    where each boundary discovered becomes the next pump inlet. The framework becomes
    autopoietic not by achieving completeness, but by maintaining dynamic equilibrium
    at the edge of chaos and order.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Intelligence Pump is a meta-cognitive mechanism wherein imperfect correspondence
  between conceptual levels generates residual tension that drives iterative deepening
  of understanding. Each pump stroke consists of: (1) pushing a concept against a target
  (compression), (2) identifying the mismatch (gap detection), (3) using the residue to
  point toward next inquiry (expansion), (4) generating refined correspondence (new
  compression). The pump maintains itself by never achieving perfect fit—the residue
  **is** the fuel. Critical parameters: depth per stroke must remain shallow (2-3 terms),
  gaps must be visible without specialized training, and each cycle must simultaneously
  tighten correspondence and reveal deeper structure.

context_windows:
  - module: CORE-001
    excerpt: |
      The Pirouette Seed establishes that frameworks discover themselves through
      iterative refinement. Each correspondence reveals what it cannot yet explain,
      and that revelation is not failure but compass. The residue left between map
      and territory is the gradient along which understanding flows.
  - module: CORE-014
    excerpt: |
      The Fractal Bridge demonstrates that correspondence across scales is never
      perfect—and shouldn't be. The mismatch encodes the information about how
      scales relate. A perfect bridge would collapse the hierarchy; the gaps are
      load-bearing structures.
  - module: META-AUTO-001
    excerpt: |
      The pump works because perfect fit kills motion. If Γ-field mapped exactly
      to CDM with zero residue, there'd be no "why next?" The mismatch itself is
      the pressure differential. You're not trying to eliminate error—you're trying
      to maintain productive tension. Like a piston engine, the pump converts
      heat (residue) into work (inquiry).

        The pump is to concepts what RG flow is to couplings: iterative refinement
        across scales, where each step reveals structure at the next level.
      justification: |
        RG flow works by integrating out degrees of freedom at one scale to get
        effective theory at another. The residue (higher-order corrections) tells
        you what you missed. The Intelligence Pump works similarly: each correspondence
        is an effective theory, residue is what got "integrated out," and examining
        residue reveals the next scale of structure.

        Instead, use the residue to bootstrap to a richer system. The pump is
        incompleteness as feature, not bug.

        Most direct mathematical analogue. RG flow is literally a pump that moves

        (irrelevant operators at one scale) becomes relevant at another. This
        captures both the iterative refinement and the scale-dependent nature
        of the Intelligence Pump.

# Intelligence Pump

## Canonical (Pirouette)

The Intelligence Pump is a meta-cognitive mechanism wherein imperfect correspondence
between conceptual levels generates residual tension that drives iterative deepening
of understanding. Each pump stroke consists of: (1) pushing a concept against a target
(compression), (2) identifying the mismatch (gap detection), (3) using the residue to
point toward next inquiry (expansion), (4) generating refined correspondence (new
compression). The pump maintains itself by never achieving perfect fit—the residue
**is** the fuel. Critical parameters: depth per stroke must remain shallow (2-3 terms),
gaps must be visible without specialized training, and each cycle must simultaneously
tighten correspondence and reveal deeper structure.

## EFT-First Summary

The Intelligence Pump is mathematically analogous to Renormalization Group flow in
physics. Just as RG flow integrates out degrees of freedom at one scale to reveal
effective theory at another—with residual corrections pointing toward the next scale—the
Intelligence Pump uses conceptual residue (what doesn't fit) to bootstrap toward richer
structure. The pump operates in the regime where prediction error is neither zero
(trivial/dead) nor maximal (noise), similar to active inference agents minimizing free
energy while maintaining model complexity. It's a formal implementation of "learning
from what you got wrong" as a self-sustaining cycle.

## Practical Implementation

**For spine writers:**
At the end of each major section, include:
- **What fits:** Explicit list of successful correspondences
- **What doesn't (yet):** Visible residue with magnitude estimates
- **The residue points toward:** Next module/inquiry with 2-3 term preview

**For readers:**
When you encounter residue callouts, ask: "If I were building this, what would I explore
next?" Compare your intuition to the framework's actual path. Alignment = pump is working.

**For AI systems:**
Implement pump monitoring in training loops:
- Track Δ_correspondence and R_residue per concept
- Flag when R → 0 (pump dying) or R > 0.7 (pump overwhelmed)
- Optimize for d_stroke ∈ [2,3] by chunking inquiries
- Use residue gradient as curriculum signal
