  art: |
    A particle's journey through spacetime creates a wake in the temporal field. The self-energy correction is the measure of the drag from that wake, a quantum echo that gives the particle its weight.
  law: |
    The self-energy correction Σν(E) from Γ-field interactions generates the effective neutrino mass via mν(E) = Re[Σν(E)]/c². This mass is inversely proportional to the neutrino's energy, a direct consequence of the coherence drag mechanism.
  philosophy: |
    Mass is not a static, intrinsic property but an emergent, dynamic effect of a particle's interaction with the temporal substrate. The self-energy correction formalizes this concept, treating mass as a measure of how much a particle's quantum phase is retarded by its environment.
pirouette_definition: |
  The quantum correction to a neutrino's propagator arising from its coupling to the stochastic background temporal pressure (Γ) field. The real part of the self-energy, Σν(E), is interpreted as the neutrino's energy-dependent effective mass, mν(E). This correction embodies the principle of **coherence drag**, where mass emerges from a retardation of the particle's phase flow rather than from a Higgs-like coupling.

        outline: |
          Measure neutrino oscillation probabilities over a wide range of energies (1-10 GeV) and long distances (L > 1000 km). Fit the data to an oscillation model where the mass-squared splittings Δm² depend on energy as predicted by Σν(E). The energy-dependence of Σν(E) introduces a non-sinusoidal modulation to the standard oscillation formula.
        expected_signals: [A 1–2% energy-dependent drift in the position of oscillation maxima/minima relative to the standard 1/E prediction.]
        pitfalls: [Insufficient energy resolution, poor statistics limiting the fit, systematic uncertainties in beam flux and interaction cross-sections mimicking an energy-dependent effect.]

      Hence `m_ν(E)` shows the **inverse-energy dependence** characteristic of coherence drag.
  - module: MATH-Γ-005
    excerpt: |
      Because `m_ν(E)` varies with energy, the oscillation phase becomes `ϕ_ij = (Δm_ij²(E) L)/(2E)`. This produces a small **non-sinusoidal modulation** at long baselines. Pirouette predicts an energy-dependent drift of order 1–2 % in oscillation maxima across 1–10 GeV beams—detectable in DUNE or Hyper-Kamiokande with high statistics.

        In standard Quantum Field Theory, the self-energy Σ(p) is the sum of all one-particle-irreducible diagrams that correct a particle's propagator. The pole of the full propagator defines the physical mass. Pirouette's Σν(E) serves the exact same mathematical function for the neutrino, with the key distinction that the dominant contribution arises from Γ-field loops, yielding an unusual energy dependence.

    This term refers specifically to the self-energy contribution from Γ-field interactions. While Standard Model electroweak loops also technically contribute to a neutrino self-energy, their effect is many orders of magnitude smaller and does not produce the required mass scale or energy dependence.

# Self-energy correction

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The quantum correction to a neutrino's propagator arising from its coupling to the stochastic background temporal pressure (Γ) field. The real part of the self-energy, Σν(E), is interpreted as the neutrino's energy-dependent effective mass, mν(E). This correction embodies the principle of **coherence drag**, where mass emerges from a retardation of the particle's quantum phase flow rather than from a Higgs-like coupling.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of Quantum Field Theory, the Pirouette self-energy correction, Σν(E), is the dominant contribution to the standard self-energy `Σ(p)` for neutrinos. It arises from an effective operator coupling the neutrino bilinear to the Γ-field, `~ (∂ν)(∂ν)Γ`. This term modifies the neutrino propagator, shifting its pole to generate an effective mass. Unlike typical mass terms, this correction is energy-dependent (`m_ν ∝ 1/E_ν`), a unique signature of the underlying coherence drag mechanism. This formulation is mathematically analogous to standard propagator corrections in QFT (see Peskin & Schroeder, Ch. 7).
