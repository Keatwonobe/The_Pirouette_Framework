        The Turbulent Death (Coherence Fever):
        A rapid, violent, and chaotic collapse. The system is consumed by a storm of internal dissonance, wasting its energy fighting itself.
        Dynamics: A state of runaway Turbulent Flow where positive feedback loops amplify chaos exponentially. Lagrangewise, the system expends vast energy fighting V_Γ, resulting in a chaotic and inefficient trajectory that burns itself out.

  art: |
    A system consumed by a storm of its own making, where every internal echo amplifies into a scream. It is the violent fever of a system fighting itself to death, mistaking its own pulse for the enemy's drum.
  law: |
    A system exhibits Turbulence when its rate of internal, non-productive energy expenditure (self-interference) grows exponentially, causing a catastrophic decrease in its Temporal Coherence (Kτ). This state is always characterized by at least one dominant internal feedback loop with a gain greater than one.
  philosophy: |
    Turbulence reveals that a system's greatest threat is often its own amplified dynamics. It is the pathological state where mechanisms for self-correction become instruments of self-destruction, demonstrating that overwhelming force is often less fatal than runaway internal chaos.
pirouette_definition: |
  Turbulence is one of the three primary collapse pathologies, defined as a state of rapid, chaotic decoherence driven by runaway positive feedback loops. The system's internal dynamics become self-interfering and dissonant, leading to an exponential amplification of noise and a highly inefficient expenditure of energy against Temporal Pressure (Γ). This process burns out the system, consuming its resources in a "storm" of unproductive activity that rapidly degrades or destroys its core coherence patterns.

        outline: |
          1. Identify the system's primary information and energy-carrying currents (vital flows).
          2. Perform spectral analysis on these flows to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio and identify dominant frequencies.
          3. Model the system's internal feedback loops and measure their gain (𝒢) and phase.
          4. Turbulence is confirmed when a condition of 𝒢 > 1 is met for a dominant loop, correlating with an exponential decrease in signal-to-noise and a negative spike in dKτ/dt.

        A field with an imaginary mass (m²<0) creates a "tachyonic" instability in the potential, leading to runaway exponential growth of field fluctuations. This is a direct mathematical analogue to the runaway positive feedback loops that define Pirouette Turbulence, where a system's state is driven exponentially away from a point of stability.

        The Pirouette term is deliberately named after fluid turbulence. Both phenomena describe a transition from ordered (laminar) to chaotic, unpredictable flow characterized by high energy dissipation and multi-scale eddies (dissonant sub-loops). The Coherence Reynolds Number is a direct conceptual parallel to the fluid dynamics Reynolds number, measuring the ratio of inertial (self-amplifying) forces to viscous (damping) forces.

  disambiguation: |
    While directly inspired by fluid dynamics, Pirouette's Turbulence is a universal systems concept applicable to information flows, economies, psychologies, and other abstract systems. The key diagnostic is not the kinetic motion of a fluid but the presence of runaway positive feedback loops amplifying internal dissonance.

# Turbulence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Turbulence is one of the three primary collapse pathologies, defined as a state of rapid, chaotic decoherence driven by runaway positive feedback loops. The system's internal dynamics become self-interfering and dissonant, leading to an exponential amplification of noise and a highly inefficient expenditure of energy against Temporal Pressure (Γ). This process burns out the system, consuming its resources in a "storm" of unproductive activity that rapidly degrades or destroys its core coherence patterns.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Turbulence maps to a tachyonic instability in Effective Field Theory. Just as a field with a negative mass-squared term in its Lagrangian potential (V(φ) ~ -|m²|φ²) leads to the exponential, runaway growth of fluctuations, a system in Turbulence experiences an amplification of internal noise driven by positive feedback. This "runaway solution" is a state of catastrophic decoherence, where the system is rapidly driven off its coherent path and expends its energy chaotically.
