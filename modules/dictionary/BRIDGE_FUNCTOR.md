        5. **Bridge functors** to existing math (so you can import theorems)

  art: |
    A Rosetta Stone translating the primordial language of order into the familiar grammar of fields and spacetime. It is the dictionary that allows new physics to speak to the old, ensuring the foundational axioms are not stranded on an island of pure mathematics.
  law: |
    The Bridge Functor Σ is a structure-preserving map that takes statistical invariants of the causal fabric (e.g., motif densities, average holonomy defects) and maps them to corresponding operators and parameters in a low-energy effective field theory (e.g., scalar densities, U(1) connection forms, coupling constants).
  philosophy: |
    To ensure the Pirouette Framework is not a self-contained formal system, but a genuine physical theory. The Bridge Functor provides the necessary semantic link, grounding abstract order-theoretic structures in the empirically validated language of quantum field theory, making the framework falsifiable and useful.
pirouette_definition: |
  A functor Σ that maps objects and morphisms from the category of locally-finite posets (the fabric) to a category of conventional physics, typically vector bundles over an emergent manifold. Σ translates order-theoretic invariants into physical fields and their dynamics. Specifically, it maps motifs like `Ki` to complex sections, order complex holonomy to gauge connections (e.g., U(1)), and scalar order-invariants like `Γ` to scalar densities, thereby inducing a physical action functional from the fabric action `S`.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless map; output units are determined by the target physical theory (e.g., inverse length for a gauge field).

      - name: Bridge Calibration via SM-CG
        outline: |
          1. In the Pirouette substrate, compute statistical properties of a large, dynamically-evolved fabric `E`, such as the average holonomy defect of a stable 'electron' motif.
          2. In the Standard Model Correspondence Gauge (SM-CG), measure the corresponding low-energy observable (e.g., the anomalous magnetic moment `a_e`).
          3. The Bridge Functor Σ provides a theoretical relation, e.g., `a_e = Σ(holonomy_defect, ...)`. The procedure verifies this predicted relationship across different substrate parameter regimes.
        expected_signals: [A stable, computable relationship between specific substrate motif statistics and measured EFT coupling constants. For example, `a_e ≈ α_eff / (2π)` where `α_eff` is a ratio of interval-count covariances from the fabric.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking a correlation in a specific regime for the true functorial mapping. The mapping must hold under variation of substrate parameters (`a_0`, `a_2`, `b`, etc.). Incorrect identification of the stable motif corresponding to a given particle.]

    excerpt: |
      **Bridge functors (so you can import theorems)**
      * **Order→Manifold**: (F: Poset_loc.fin. → Lorentz), sending large random fabrics to emergent metrics via order-invariants.
      * **Order→QFT** (Σ): pushforward along the correspondence gauge to vector bundles & connections: Ki↦complex section, holonomy↦U(1) connection, Γ↦scalar density.
      * **Order→Homology**: order complex ⇒ simplicial homology for topological control.
  - module: MATH-020
    excerpt: |
      This is a substrate-native action; pushing it through Σ yields your SM-looking quadratic terms (CORE-020).
      ...
      **Week 3 — Σ bridge**
      * Pushforward to SM-CG: compute effective (A_μ = ∂_μ arg Ki) on coarse lattice; verify quadratic limit.
      * Measure an (a_e) proxy from holonomy defect.

      justification: |
        A related functor F maps large random fabrics to emergent Lorentzian manifolds. This is Axiom A7's "hydrodynamic limit," where local interval counts and densities in the fabric `E` determine the metric components at an emergent spacetime point `x`. Σ likely operates on a manifold background provided by `F`.
      confidence: 0.8
  adopted:
    - target: A_μ (U(1) gauge connection)
      rationale: |
        Explicitly stated in MATH-020: "holonomy↦U(1) connection". This is the primary mechanism for generating gauge interactions from the substrate's topological properties. The planned Week 3 build task is to compute an effective `A_μ` from motif phases, confirming this as a central, operationalized part of the framework.

  claims:
    - statement: "There exists a stable, computable functor Σ that maps the statistical properties of fabric holonomy and motifs to the observed coupling constants and field content of the Standard Model in a low-energy limit."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If no choice of parameters (`a_0, a_2, b`, etc.) in the fabric action `S` can reproduce the known structure and coupling constants of the Standard Model after being pushed through Σ. Alternatively, if the predicted relationships are unstable or depend sensitively on the simulation scale."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [Σ is standard for summation and often used for self-energy in QFT or cross-section in particle physics.]
  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, Σ denotes a functorial map, not a sum. The alias 'Pushforward' is borrowed from differential geometry, where it describes mapping tangent vectors; the concept is analogous to mapping local fabric structures to local field structures. Here, the domain is a category of posets, not a smooth manifold.
