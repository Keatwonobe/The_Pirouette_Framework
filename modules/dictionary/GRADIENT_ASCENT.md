        This is the algorithm of continuous, local optimization. The Weaver takes a step, senses the resulting change in its coherence, and adjusts its internal pattern accordingly. This is the essence of trial-and-error, of practice, and of reinforcement learning.

  art: |
    The patient art of climbing an unseen mountain, guided only by the feeling of the ground rising beneath one's feet. It is learning whispered from the echo of a single step.
  law: |
    A system refines its internal pattern (`Ki`) by iteratively adjusting it in the direction of the greatest local increase in Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`), as measured from its recent history of interactions (its Wound Channel).
  philosophy: |
    Gradient Ascent grounds evolution in the tangible process of learning. It asserts that progress is not solely the result of random mutation or grand synthesis, but is built upon the persistent, iterative work of trial-and-error adaptation within a local context.
pirouette_definition: |
  The algorithm for continuous, local optimization within the Geodesic Engine. It describes how a Weaver (system) uses its memory of recent actions and outcomes—its Wound Channel—to calculate the local gradient of Temporal Coherence (∇K_τ). The Weaver then adjusts its internal resonant pattern (`Ki`) along this gradient, iteratively climbing towards a state of higher coherence. This process represents learning, practice, and adaptation.

        outline: |
          1. Initialize a Weaver (e.g., an RL agent) with a pattern `Ki_0`.
          2. Allow the Weaver to interact with its Crucible (environment) for `N` steps.
          3. Record the sequence of states, actions, and resulting `K_τ` (reward) values into its Wound Channel.
          4. Use the Wound Channel data to compute an estimate of the gradient `∇K_τ` with respect to the parameters of `Ki`.
          5. Update the pattern: `Ki_{t+1} = Ki_t + α * ∇K_τ`.
          6. Repeat from step 2 until `K_τ` converges.
        expected_signals: [A noisy but monotonically increasing curve of average `K_τ` per epoch, Convergence of `Ki` parameters to a stable value.]
        pitfalls: [Convergence to a local, suboptimal maximum (`Stagnant Flow`), Divergence due to an overly large learning rate `α` (`Turbulent Flow`).]

      **I. Gradient Ascent (The Dance of Learning)**
      This is the algorithm of continuous, local optimization. The Weaver takes a step, senses the resulting change in its coherence, and adjusts its internal pattern accordingly. This is the essence of trial-and-error, of practice, and of reinforcement learning. The Weaver’s memory of its recent attempts—its **Wound Channel**—provides the data to calculate the local coherence gradient.
  - module: DOMA-083
    excerpt: |
      **Policy Optimization (The Genetic Weaving):**
      The Crucible is a reinforcement learning environment... The Weaver is an AI agent whose policy is its `Ki`. The engine guides the agent's evolution via the twin algorithms. **Gradient Ascent** is the standard reinforcement learning loop, updating the policy based on the reward signal from the Wound Channel (replay buffer).

      equation_hint: |
        θ_{k+1} = θ_k + α ∇J(θ_k)
      justification: |
        The source module explicitly equates Gradient Ascent with the "standard reinforcement learning loop" where a policy's parameters (θ, equivalent to `Ki`) are updated to maximize a reward function (J(θ), equivalent to expected `K_τ`). The use of a "replay buffer" (Wound Channel) to estimate the gradient is a direct operational match.

  claims:
    - statement: "For any system capable of learning in a static Crucible, its trajectory of adaptation can be modeled as a path that locally maximizes Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Demonstrating a learning system that consistently and deliberately chooses paths of lower local coherence to achieve a distant, higher-coherence goal, where this behavior is not explainable as a mechanism for escaping a local optimum. This would falsify the strictly 'local' nature of the process."

  disambiguation: |
    Within Pirouette, Gradient Ascent is not merely a mathematical tool but a fundamental physical process of adaptation. It is always defined in opposition to Alchemical Leap, representing the continuous, local mode of evolution, whereas the Leap represents the discontinuous, non-local mode.
