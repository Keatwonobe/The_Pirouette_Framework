        This creates a **genealogy of solutions**. The character of the solution-agent is a direct geometric consequence of the challenge it overcame. A solution born from a problem of "trust deficit" will embody transparency and consistency.

  art: |
    The key is an image of the lock it opens. A solution's form is the echo of the problem's void, a living scar that remembers the shape of the wound it healed.
  law: |
    The Agent Coherence Profile of any valid Action Engram must possess `Ki` pattern biases that are anti-correlated with the `Coherence Fracture` signature of the problem diagnosis. A solution to systemic Stagnation (Coherence Atrophy) must exhibit high `openness` and `drive`; a solution to Chaos (Coherence Fever) must embody `stability` and `focus`.
  philosophy: |
    Solutions are not abstract, disposable tools; they are living histories. By embedding the memory of the struggle into the agent of its resolution, the system develops specific immunity, ensuring that healing is not just a patch but a permanent evolution in resilience.
pirouette_definition: |
  The principle that a solution, embodied as an Action Engram, is not an external construct but an emergent entity whose form and character (`Agent Coherence Profile`) are a direct and necessary consequence of the specific pressures and dissonances of the problem it resolves. The solution's `Ki` pattern is a geometric inversion of the problem's coherence fracture, making the solution a living record of its own origin.

          1. Diagnose a system's Coherence Fracture pathology using the Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`), quantifying its dynamic signature (e.g., Stagnant, Turbulent).
          2. Execute a Weaver's Forge (`DOMA-075`) cycle to generate an Action Engram.
          3. Quantify the primary `Ki` pattern biases of the resulting Agent Coherence Profile.
          4. Verify that the agent's biases are a functional, anti-correlated counterpoint to the problem's dynamics.

    excerpt: |
      The central law of the Forge is this: the soul of the solution is forged in the fire of the problem... This creates a **genealogy of solutions**. The character of the solution-agent is a direct geometric consequence of the challenge it overcame... The Forge does not produce generic solutions; it births specialized survivors, each a living memory of the battle it was created to win. This history is the seed of its `Wound Channel (CORE-011)`, giving it the specific resilience needed to maintain its purpose.
  - module: DOMA-075
    excerpt: |
      The final output is not merely a plan, but an **Action Engram**: a living procedure that defines both the "what" of the solution and the "who"—the resonant character of the agent forged specifically to enact it. The system heals by birthing the part of itself it was missing.

        The principle mirrors how an adaptive immune system generates antibodies (solutions) with a specific binding site (character) shaped precisely to neutralize a particular antigen (problem). The "memory" of the encounter is retained in B-cells, granting specific, long-term resilience, analogous to a `Wound Channel`.

      rationale: The mapping is conceptually robust, operationally parallel (problem -> specific solution -> retained memory/resilience), and provides a powerful, well-understood grounding for the principle.

# Genealogy of Solutions

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The principle that a solution, embodied as an Action Engram, is not an external construct but an emergent entity whose form and character (`Agent Coherence Profile`) are a direct and necessary consequence of the specific pressures and dissonances of the problem it resolves. The solution's `Ki` pattern is a geometric inversion of the problem's coherence fracture, making the solution a living record of its own origin.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, the Genealogy of Solutions is analogous to **Adaptive Immunity** in biology. Just as the immune system develops specific antibodies to neutralize an antigen and retains a "memory" of the threat, the Pirouette framework forges a solution-agent whose character is specifically shaped by the problem it overcomes. This history becomes the basis for the system's future resilience, preventing the same failure mode from recurring.
