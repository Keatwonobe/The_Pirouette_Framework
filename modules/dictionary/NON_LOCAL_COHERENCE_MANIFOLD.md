        Entanglement is defined not as a mysterious link, but as the formation of a single, unified, non-local coherence manifold when two such resonances unite.

    A single song played by two instruments separated by an ocean; to touch one is to touch them both. The manifold is the song itself, a resonant structure whose unity is not diminished by the distance between its voices.
  law: |
    A local perturbation applied to any anchor point of a non-local coherence manifold instigates an instantaneous, global reconfiguration of the entire manifold to the new state that maximizes the joint Pirouette Lagrangian. The resulting correlations between anchor points will violate Bell's inequalities but will not permit superluminal signaling.
  philosophy: |
    The manifold replaces the paradox of non-local interaction with the concept of non-local identity. It asserts that at a fundamental level, connection is a more primitive concept than location; entanglement is not a strange dialogue but a simple monologue from a being that exists in two places at once.
pirouette_definition: |
  The single, unified geometric structure that spans the locations of two or more entangled systems. It is formed during a Triadic Lock via the Alchemical Union of compatible Triadic Resonances. The manifold is not a bridge between separate systems but a single, higher-dimensional entity governed by a joint Pirouette Lagrangian. Its global topology encodes the correlated information of the system, and its fracture upon measurement (the casting of an Observer's Shadow) results in the observed correlated outcomes.

          1. Prepare an ensemble of systems in a Triadic Lock, creating a population of identical ùìú_NL.
          2. Separate the anchor points (e.g., entangled particles A and B) to a space-like separation.
          3. Perform measurements of a chosen observable (e.g., spin) on A and B along various randomly chosen axes.
          4. Correlate the measurement outcomes. The existence and integrity of ùìú_NL are inferred if the correlations violate a Bell-type inequality.

      The "spooky action at a distance" is thus the natural consequence of a single, unified body responding to a stimulus, even when that body is stretched across spacetime... Their two separate coherence manifolds are not merely joined but are completely re-woven into a single, higher-dimensional manifold that is fundamentally non-local.

    excerpt: |
      A Triadic Lock is a naturally error-corrected qubit. Its information is not stored in a fragile local state but in the robust, global topology of the entire non-local manifold. Local environmental noise is insufficient to break the union; only a direct measurement can fracture the shared geometry...

        The Non-local Coherence Manifold is the Pirouette Framework's geometric reification of an abstract entangled state vector. The manifold's property of being a single, indivisible entity corresponds to the mathematical non-separability of the state vector. The instantaneous collapse of the manifold upon measurement mirrors the projection of the state vector onto a basis, explaining correlated outcomes without superluminal communication.

    The Non-local Coherence Manifold (ùìú_NL) must be distinguished from the individual coherence manifolds (Ki) of the systems before they unite. ùìú_NL is a new, emergent entity created by the Alchemical Union, not a simple summation or connection of the original two. It is a geometric object, not a physical wormhole or bridge through spacetime.

# Non-local Coherence Manifold

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The single, unified geometric structure that spans the locations of two or more entangled systems. It is formed during a Triadic Lock via the Alchemical Union of compatible Triadic Resonances. The manifold is not a bridge between separate systems but a single, higher-dimensional entity governed by a joint Pirouette Lagrangian. Its global topology encodes the correlated information of the system, and its fracture upon measurement (the casting of an Observer's Shadow) results in the observed correlated outcomes.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of quantum mechanics, the Non-local Coherence Manifold is the geometric representation of an entangled state vector in a composite Hilbert space. Its unified topology accounts for the non-local correlations that violate Bell's inequalities, and its collapse upon measurement corresponds to the projection of the state vector onto a measurement basis. This provides a physical geometry for the abstract mathematical formalism of non-separable quantum states.
