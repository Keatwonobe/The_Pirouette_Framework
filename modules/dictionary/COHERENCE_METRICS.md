        **Task:** Define 1-3 concrete, measurable indicators that reflect your Prime Geodesic.
        *   *Example for a "Connections" Principle:*
            *   Metric 1: Number of substantive, non-transactional conversations per week.
            *   Metric 2: Ratio of time spent listening vs. speaking in key relationships.

    The tangible dials on your life's dashboard, showing not speed, but the resonance of your travel. They are the quiet hum of an engine running true to its design, the felt sense of a path well-walked.
  law: |
    For any chosen Prime Geodesic, a set of observable, quantifiable metrics must be defined such that a change in the metrics correlates directly with the integrated action (S_p) of the personal Lagrangian over the measurement period. Without such metrics, the Geodesic remains an untestable assertion.
  philosophy: |
    A principle without a practice is a ghost. Coherence Metrics ground the sovereign act of self-authorship in reality, transforming a philosophical declaration into a lived, falsifiable experiment. They are the instruments that prevent self-deception, ensuring the map one draws is the territory one actually navigates.

  A set of user-defined, concrete, and observable indicators used to approximate the integrated action (`S_p = ‚à´ ùìõ_p dt`) of a personal Lagrangian over a finite time interval. These metrics provide a practical feedback mechanism to assess an entity's adherence to its self-authored Prime Geodesic, translating an abstract Coherence Principle into a testable, day-to-day practice.

        outline: |
          1. Define a Prime Geodesic as per DOMA-022.
          2. Specify 1-3 concrete, observable Coherence Metrics (M_i) causally linked to the Geodesic's core action.
          3. Establish a baseline for each M_i.
          4. Track M_i over a defined time period (e.g., one week, one month).
          5. Correlate changes in M_i with subjective and objective assessments of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001).

        Like KPIs or OKRs, Coherence Metrics are user-defined, quantifiable measurements designed to track progress toward a high-level strategic objective (the Prime Geodesic). They serve the same function of translating abstract intent into concrete, measurable action and feedback.

  disambiguation: |
    Coherence Metrics are distinct from the abstract concept of Coherence (KœÑ) itself. KœÑ is the 'kinetic' term in the Lagrangian representing the state to be maximized, while Coherence Metrics are the practical, external measurements used to track whether that maximization is occurring over time.

# Coherence Metrics

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A set of user-defined, concrete, and observable indicators used to approximate the integrated action (`S_p = ‚à´ ùìõ_p dt`) of a personal Lagrangian over a finite time interval. These metrics provide a practical feedback mechanism to assess an entity's adherence to its self-authored Prime Geodesic, translating an abstract Coherence Principle into a testable, day-to-day practice.

## EFT-First Summary
In an effective field theory framework, an entity's state is described by a personal Lagrangian. Coherence Metrics are the chosen, macroscopic observables used to probe this system's dynamics over time. They are proxies for the integrated action, allowing an observer (including the entity itself) to verify if the system is following the path of maximal coherence predicted by its internal laws of motion.
