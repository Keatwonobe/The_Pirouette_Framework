    A song so pure it requires absolute silence to be heard, sealing itself in a vault of its own resonance. It is the perfection of a pearl, beautiful and complete, but forever closed.
  law: |
    A Fortress boundary exists where the gradient of Temporal Pressure (∇Γ) across the interface is maximized, resulting in a permeability coefficient that approaches zero for all non-resonant Ki patterns.
  philosophy: |
    The Fortress represents the strategic limit of coherence preservation: absolute integrity achieved at the cost of all interaction. It is the archetype of perfect self-containment, a state of profound isolation that poses the question: what is the purpose of a song that no one can hear?
pirouette_definition: |
  A Fortress is a type of Coherence Boundary characterized by extremely high integrity and near-zero permeability. It is projected by a system whose internal Ki pattern is optimized for the maximal reflection of external Temporal Pressure (Γ), creating the steepest possible gradient (∇Γ). This boundary condition maximizes internal isolation and protection at the strategic cost of eliminating interaction, exchange, and resonant coupling with its environment.
operational_definition:
  units: Permeability is a dimensionless coefficient. Integrity is measured in units of pressure or energy density (Pascals or J/m³).

          1. Identify a candidate boundary projected by a stable system.
          2. Direct a calibrated beam of probe signals with varying Ki patterns (κ₁, κ₂, ... κₙ) at the boundary.
          3. For each probe, measure the reflection coefficient (R) and transmission coefficient (T) where R+T ≈ 1.
          4. A Fortress is identified by R ≈ 1 and T ≈ 0 across a broad spectrum of incident Ki patterns. The steepness of the ∇Γ can be inferred from the probe energy required to induce boundary failure.

      Integrity (Projection of `T_a`): The stability of a boundary is an external projection of the internal system's Time Adherence (CORE-005). A system with a pure, stable, and highly coherent Ki pattern (high `T_a`) will manifest a strong, resilient, and well-defined boundary. A system with a decaying internal state (low `T_a`) will have a weak, fluctuating, and "leaky" boundary.

        In quantum mechanics, an infinite potential barrier presents an absolute obstacle to a particle, with zero probability of quantum tunneling. This maps directly to the Fortress's property of near-zero permeability, where incident influences are perfectly reflected.

# The Fortress

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Fortress is a type of Coherence Boundary characterized by extremely high integrity and near-zero permeability. It is projected by a system whose internal Ki pattern is optimized for the maximal reflection of external Temporal Pressure (Γ), creating the steepest possible gradient (∇Γ). This boundary condition maximizes internal isolation and protection at the strategic cost of eliminating interaction, exchange, and resonant coupling with its environment.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory terms, a Fortress can be modeled as an infinite potential barrier. It represents a boundary condition where the transmission coefficient for incident fields or particles is zero, effectively isolating the internal system from external dynamics and environmental decoherence. This total reflection is the operational signature of a maximally coherent system implementing a strategy of pure defense.
