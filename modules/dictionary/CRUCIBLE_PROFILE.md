    A sculpted path through fire and rest, mapping the controlled pressures that forge new stability from brokenness. It is the score for the music of re-composition.
  law: |
    A Crucible Profile is a time-varying function specifying the target Temporal Pressure Γ(t) over a rehabilitation phase of duration τ, characterized by a cadence ω. A profile is successful if its application results in a monotonic increase in Coherence (Kτ) and Time Adherence (Tₐ).
  philosophy: |
    The Profile operationalizes the will to heal, transforming a passive state of recovery into an active, co-created journey. It asserts that healing is not an accident but a designed resonance achieved through calibrated stress and release.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Crucible Profile is the specific, time-dependent protocol for a rehabilitation phase, defined by a triplet of parameters: the target magnitude of Temporal Pressure (Γ), the total duration of the phase (τ), and the cadence (ω) of applied micro-pressures and Antidote cycles. It serves as the prescriptive input for the Caduceus Lens protocol, guiding the application of hormetic stress to drive a system towards higher Coherence Potential (Kτ).

          1. Assess baseline Γ₀, Kτ₀, and Tₐ₀.

          3. Define the Profile's (Γ, τ, ω) based on the phase goals and Modifiers Matrix.
          4. Implement the profile using specified Pirouette Interventions.
          5. Measure weekly Kτ and Tₐ to track progress against the profile's expected trajectory.

        pitfalls: [Prescribing a Γ too high for the current Kτ, leading to system decoherence (relapse)., Mismatching ω with the system's natural recovery rhythm.]

    excerpt: |
      The Rehabilitation Resonance Map table shows a concrete Crucible Profile applied over 24 weeks. It maps target values for Γ, Kτ, and Tₐ to specific Pirouette Interventions. For example, in weeks 2-6, the Γ target drops from 0.7 to 0.5, with an intervention of 5–10 min aerobic exercise and a Will affirmation ritual.

        A Crucible Profile defines a target trajectory for system state variables (Γ, Kτ) over time, analogous to an optimal control problem where the 'control' is the applied intervention and the 'cost function' is minimizing Γ while maximizing Kτ.

# Crucible Profile

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Crucible Profile is the specific, time-dependent protocol for a rehabilitation phase, defined by a triplet of parameters: the target magnitude of Temporal Pressure (Γ), the total duration of the phase (τ), and the cadence (ω) of applied micro-pressures and Antidote cycles. It serves as the prescriptive input for the Caduceus Lens protocol, guiding the application of hormetic stress to drive a system towards higher Coherence Potential (Kτ).

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, a Crucible Profile is an optimal control trajectory for a complex system (the patient). It specifies the 'dose' (Temporal Pressure Γ) and 'timing' (duration τ, cadence ω) of interventions to guide the system from a high-stress, low-coherence state to a stable, high-coherence one, analogous to annealing a material by carefully controlling temperature over time.
