        Show that **non-Abelian gauge symmetry** is the **local relabeling freedom of degenerate temporal-resonance frames**. Promote those relabelings to a local symmetry ⇒ introduce a **connection** (A_\mu = A_\mu^a T^a).

    Maxwell's law came from one clock ticking consistently everywhere. Yang–Mills theory comes from many clocks that must agree at once—a moving scaffold of temporal frames whose internal curvature *is* the force.
  law: |
    A local degeneracy of N internal resonance modes implies an SU(N) freedom to relabel the basis at each spacetime point. Promoting this freedom to a local symmetry requires a connection field A_\mu. The energy cost of non-uniform frame orientations (frame stiffness) manifests as the Yang–Mills Lagrangian, \mathcal{L} = -\tfrac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}^a F^{a,\mu\nu}, whose non-linear term [A_\mu, A_\nu] is a direct measure of the frame bundle's curvature.
  philosophy: |
    Symmetry is not a fundamental axiom but an emergent consequence of physical redundancy. Non-Abelian gauge symmetry is the structure governing the ambiguity in choosing a basis for degenerate physical states (temporal resonances). Force is the medium's reaction to variations in this arbitrary choice.
pirouette_definition: |
  The local freedom to relabel the basis of a degenerate set of N temporal-resonance frames at each spacetime point, described by a group G (e.g., SU(N)). To preserve physics under this local relabeling, a connection field A_\mu (the gauge field) is introduced to define parallel transport between frames. The energy cost of spatial or temporal variations in the frame orientation ("frame stiffness") gives rise to the Yang–Mills field strength F_{\mu\nu} and its associated Lagrangian, which governs the dynamics of the connection field and its self-interactions.

        outline: |
          In high-energy particle collisions (e.g., p-p at the LHC), measure the production rates and angular distributions of processes involving three or four final-state gauge bosons (e.g., pp → W⁺W⁻, pp → WZ). These events are sensitive to the triple and quartic gauge vertices predicted by the `[A, A]` term in F_{\mu\nu}.

      rationale: Below the coherence barrier \omega_c, the emergent dynamics governed by temporal-frame stiffness are described by the standard Yang-Mills Lagrangian. The Pirouette framework provides a physical origin for the symmetry and its associated fields, but the resulting low-energy effective field theory is mathematically and operationally identical to the Standard Model gauge sector.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, this symmetry is not a fundamental axiom but an emergent property derived from a physical redundancy in the temporal medium (degenerate resonance modes). This contrasts with the standard axiomatic approach where gauge symmetry is postulated a priori. The physics is the same in the IR, but the origin story is different.

# Non-Abelian gauge symmetry

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Non-Abelian gauge symmetry is the local freedom to relabel the basis of a degenerate set of N temporal-resonance frames at each spacetime point, described by a group G (e.g., SU(N)). To preserve physics under this local relabeling, a connection field A_\mu (the gauge field) is introduced to define parallel transport between frames. The energy cost of spatial or temporal variations in the frame orientation ("frame stiffness") gives rise to the Yang–Mills field strength F_{\mu\nu} and its associated Lagrangian, which governs the dynamics of the connection field and its self-interactions.

## EFT-First Summary
This term maps directly to the Non-Abelian gauge symmetries of the Standard Model, such as SU(2) and SU(3), which form the basis of the electroweak and strong forces. The dynamics are described by Yang-Mills theory, where the Lagrangian \(\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}^a F^{a,\mu\nu}\) includes self-interaction terms for the force-carrying gauge bosons (e.g., W bosons and gluons). In Pirouette, this entire structure is not postulated but emerges from the physical requirement of maintaining coherence across a degenerate basis of internal temporal resonances.
