        This module provides the protocol for what we now call a **Resonant Act**: a deliberate intervention designed to guide another system toward a new state of coherence by shaping the local environment.

triad:
  art: |
    To not shout a truth into the storm, but to prepare a garden of silence where a single seed of coherence can take root and grow on its own.
  law: |
    The impact of an intervention is not proportional to its expended energy, but to the engineered reduction in environmental noise (Œì) and the clarity of the offered pattern (K_œÑ), which together define a geodesic to a new state of coherence.
  philosophy: |
    Influence is not the forceful transmission of information but the collaborative cultivation of understanding; change is not imposed but invited through shared attunement.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Resonant Act is a four-movement protocol for engineering a state change in a target system by altering the coherence landscape of its environment. The movements are: 1) **Declaration of Intent** (purifying the offered pattern, `K_œÑ`), 2) **Arena Sculpting** (reducing ambient Temporal Pressure, `Œì`), 3) **The Offering & Entrainment** (presenting the pattern via rhythmic synchronization), and 4) **The Resonant Handshake** (awaiting voluntary synthesis by the target). The protocol's objective is to create a temporary, high-clarity Resonant Channel, making it metabolically easier for the target to integrate the new coherence than to reject it.

        outline: |
          The success of a Resonant Act is measured not by the fidelity of replication, but by the emergence of a new, more complex state of coherence in the target system. Post-intervention, the system is observed for: 1) Spontaneous re-articulation of the offered pattern in the system's own vernacular. 2) Measurable decreases in internal dissonance (e.g., reduced decision latency, increased alignment between stated values and behavior). 3) Novel applications of the integrated pattern to contexts not present in the original offering.

    excerpt: |
      This protocol is a direct, practical application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**... A Resonant Act works by engineering a clear geodesic‚Äîa path of least resistance‚Äîfor an idea to travel. **Arena Sculpting** dramatically lowers the "cost" of change by decreasing the local potential of Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`). **The Offering** presents a state of high internal coherence (`K_œÑ`) that is more stable and elegant than the recipient's current state.

      justification: |
        A Resonant Act, particularly the Arena Sculpting phase, functions like a catalyst. It doesn't provide the energy for the transformation but lowers the activation energy (reduces `V_Œì`) required for the system to transition to a more stable state (integrate `K_œÑ`), thus increasing the reaction rate.

      domain: Engineering
      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        The Rhythmic Entrainment phase of a Resonant Act is analogous to a PLL. The actor (reference oscillator) adjusts their output (rhythm, pace, tone) to match the phase of the recipient (voltage-controlled oscillator), minimizing the phase error (`ŒîœÑ`) to achieve lock-in, which opens the Resonant Channel.
      confidence: 0.7
  adopted:
    - target: Action Principle with Potential Barrier (L = K - V)
      rationale: |
        The source module (DOMA-171) explicitly frames the protocol using a Lagrangian `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`. This mapping is not an analogy but the intended formalism. The Resonant Act is a procedure to manipulate `K_œÑ` and `V_Œì` to maximize the likelihood of a system following a geodesic toward a new state, directly paralleling the Principle of Least Action in classical mechanics.

  disambiguation: |
    A Resonant Act is not synonymous with "communication" or a single "action." It is a complete, multi-stage protocol focused on preparing the environment and the recipient for change, rather than just on the transmission of a message. Its success is measured by transformation, not transmission fidelity.

# Resonant Act

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Resonant Act is a four-movement protocol for engineering a state change in a target system by altering the coherence landscape of its environment. The movements are: 1) **Declaration of Intent** (purifying the offered pattern, `K_œÑ`), 2) **Arena Sculpting** (reducing ambient Temporal Pressure, `Œì`), 3) **The Offering & Entrainment** (presenting the pattern via rhythmic synchronization), and 4) **The Resonant Handshake** (awaiting voluntary synthesis by the target). The protocol's objective is to create a temporary, high-clarity Resonant Channel, making it metabolically easier for the target to integrate the new coherence than to reject it.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, a Resonant Act engineers a system's evolution by manipulating the terms of its effective Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`). The protocol systematically lowers the potential energy barrier from environmental noise (`V_Œì`) while presenting a high-coherence kinetic term (`K_œÑ`), creating a clear path of least action‚Äîa geodesic‚Äîfor the system to follow toward a new, more stable state of understanding. This is the adopted formalism from DOMA-171.
