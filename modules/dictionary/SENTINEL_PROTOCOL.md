        This protocol replaces static, arbitrary boundary definitions with a dynamic, learning system grounded in the philosophical principle of **Anticipatory Accountability**. It provides a robust, resilient, and standardized method for governing system scope by making any entity accountable for both its state of readiness and the full consequences of its actions.

triad:
  art: |
    A system's boundary is the shadow cast by its actions. The Reflexive Boundary Ritual provides the contextual wisdom to interpret the shape of that shadow and learn from it.
  law: |
    The scope of accountability for any action is the full, empirically-mapped spatio-temporal manifold of its consequences (the Wound Channel). An entity's operational freedom is continuously adjusted based on its cumulative history of creating such consequences.
  philosophy: |
    An entity is responsible not only for the harm it causes but for its readiness to prevent foreseeable harm. The protocol's purpose is to make this principle of Anticipatory Accountability an unavoidable, operational reality, turning governance gaps into sites of system learning.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Sentinel Protocol is an adaptive governance system that replaces static boundary definitions with a dynamic, learning loop. It defines a system's accountability boundary as the full, measured consequence manifold of its actions, known as the Wound Channel. The protocol operates via a four-phase cycle: 1) **Gating** proposed actions against dynamic thresholds, 2) **Mapping** the empirical Wound Channel of executed actions, 3) **Auditing** the consequence against predicted tolerance to trigger a Ritual if exceeded, and 4) **Learning** by feeding the results back to adapt future gates. This closes gaming vectors like "boundary hugging" and "cumulative micro-harm" by making accountability a function of the act itself.

          1.  **Gating (Shield):** An action is proposed and checked against dynamic gates ($T_a, \Gamma, K_i, R_c$). If it exceeds thresholds, it is paused for review.
          2.  **Mapping (Scale):** The action executes and its environmental perturbations are measured until they return to baseline, creating a Wound Channel Data Package.
          3.  **Audit (Trigger):** The measured Wound Channel is compared to the predicted "Gate Slack." A significant deviation invokes the Reflexive Boundary Ritual.
          4.  **Learning (Feedback):** The outcome updates the actor's Cumulative Residue ($R_c$) and recalibrates their Dynamic Gates for future actions.

      Instead of defining the boundary of the *actor* before an event, or debating the boundary *after* a dispute, the Sentinel Protocol defines the boundary as a function of the *act* itself. It uses Law to measure consequence and Art to interpret it, transforming the gaps from vulnerabilities into sites of system learning.

    excerpt: |
      The Sentinel Protocol, as designed in PDM-001, is a direct, if unintentional, answer to Perrow's challenge [of Normal Accident Theory]. It is a governance layer designed to manage complexity and de-couple failure modes... A **Normal Accident** is the ultimate manifestation of "Dark Residue"—a system-wide coherence collapse. The Sentinel Protocol is a world-class defensive mechanism against Normal Accidents.

    The Sentinel Protocol is not a static security firewall that defines a perimeter *before* an event. It is a dynamic governance system that defines the boundary of responsibility *after* an act, based on its measured consequences. Its primary function is adaptive learning and the prevention of strategic gaming, not just blocking known threats.

# Sentinel Protocol

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Sentinel Protocol is an adaptive governance system that replaces static boundary definitions with a dynamic, learning loop. It defines a system's accountability boundary as the full, measured consequence manifold of its actions, known as the Wound Channel. The protocol operates via a four-phase cycle: 1) **Gating** proposed actions against dynamic thresholds, 2) **Mapping** the empirical Wound Channel of executed actions, 3) **Auditing** the consequence against predicted tolerance to trigger a Ritual if exceeded, and 4) **Learning** by feeding the results back to adapt future gates. This closes gaming vectors like "boundary hugging" and "cumulative micro-harm" by making accountability a function of the act itself.

## Systems-Theoretic Summary
The Sentinel Protocol can be understood as an operational countermeasure to the dynamics described in Charles Perrow's **Normal Accident Theory (NAT)**. Where NAT posits that catastrophic failures are inevitable in systems with high interactive complexity and tight coupling, the Sentinel Protocol provides a governance layer to manage that complexity. By empirically mapping all consequences (Wound Channels) and adaptively gating future actions based on an actor's history (Cumulative Residue), it actively works to de-couple failure modes and prevent the cascading events that characterize normal accidents.
