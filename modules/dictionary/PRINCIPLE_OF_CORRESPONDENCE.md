        This is the Principle of Correspondence. To apply the Pirouette Framework to any domain, we do not change the core equations (like the Pirouette Lagrangian). Instead, we identify the domain-specific manifestations of the core variables. This is an act of translation.

    The same song played by many instruments. The universe's fundamental dance—a pirouette of coherence against chaos—is performed by the electron, the forest, and the idea alike.
  law: |
    To analyze any system, the universal dynamics (e.g., the Pirouette Lagrangian) must be held constant. The core variables (Kτ, Γ, Wound Channel) must be mapped to specific, measurable, domain-dependent phenomena.
  philosophy: |
    This principle ensures the framework's universality and utility, bridging the abstract blueprint of cosmic law to the concrete materials of any specific domain. It asserts that complexity arises not from new laws, but from new expressions of a single, scalable law.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Principle of Correspondence is the meta-protocol for applying the Pirouette Framework. It posits that the core dynamics of the framework (e.g., the maximization of Coherence against Temporal Pressure) are universal and fractal, applying to all systems at all scales. Applying the framework to a specific domain is an act of translation, not reformulation; one must identify and measure the domain-specific phenomena that serve as the local variables for the universal principles.

          1. **Define System & Boundary:** Isolate the target system from its environment.
          2. **Map Core Variables:** Identify the measurable, domain-specific phenomena that correspond to universal principles like Coherence (Kτ), Temporal Pressure (Γ), and the Wound Channel.
          3. **Locate Geodesic:** Apply the Pirouette Lagrangian using the mapped variables to predict the system's most probable evolutionary path.
          4. **Identify Resonant Handshakes:** Analyze system-environment interactions to find potential for Alchemical Union (phase shifts to higher complexity).

      The universe is not wasteful. It does not invent new fundamental laws for every new scale of complexity. It is fractal. The same essential dynamics that govern a quark in a proton also govern a star in a galaxy and a thought in a mind. The song remains the same; only the instruments change. This is the Principle of Correspondence.

      This is the practical "tooling" for using the framework. To analyze any system, from any domain, follow these steps: Define the System and Boundary... Map the Core Variables... Locate the Geodesic... Identify Resonant Handshakes... This is the most crucial step.

        In statistical mechanics, universality describes how disparate microscopic systems can exhibit identical macroscopic behavior near a phase transition, governed by a few key parameters. The Principle of Correspondence makes a stronger claim: all complex systems fall into a *single* universality class whose dynamics are described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, once the correct domain-specific variables are identified.

        Bohr's principle ensures quantum mechanics is consistent with classical mechanics in the limit of large quantum numbers. Both principles serve as a "bridge" between a fundamental theory and its domain of application. However, Pirouette's principle is about universal applicability across domains via translation, not a limiting case for consistency.

    Bohr's principle is a consistency check, stating that a new theory (Quantum Mechanics) must reproduce an old one (Classical Mechanics) in the appropriate limit. The Pirouette Principle of Correspondence is a stronger claim of *universal fractal structure*, stating that a single set of dynamic laws applies across all domains and scales via variable substitution, not as a limiting case.

# Principle of Correspondence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Principle of Correspondence is the meta-protocol for applying the Pirouette Framework. It posits that the core dynamics of the framework (e.g., the maximization of Coherence against Temporal Pressure) are universal and fractal, applying to all systems at all scales. Applying the framework to a specific domain is an act of translation, not reformulation; one must identify and measure the domain-specific phenomena that serve as the local variables for the universal principles.

## EFT-First Summary
The Principle of Correspondence asserts that all complex adaptive systems belong to a single, universal dynamical class. This is conceptually analogous to the idea of universality classes in the Renormalization Group approach to statistical mechanics, where disparate microscopic systems exhibit identical macroscopic behavior governed by a few relevant parameters. Here, the claim is that the Pirouette Lagrangian describes the universal behavior of any system, provided its domain-specific expressions of Coherence (Kτ) and Temporal Pressure (Γ) are correctly identified.
