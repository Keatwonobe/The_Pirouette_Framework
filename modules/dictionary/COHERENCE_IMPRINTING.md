    Carving the architect's blueprint for a riverbed into the landscape of possibility. When the water of reality begins to flow, it naturally follows the intended course.

    A system's future trajectory will follow the path of maximal net coherence (‚à´ùìõ_plan dt). A successful imprint creates a geodesic where the desired future state is the path of least action.

    Planning is not passive prediction but active creation. Intent is an act of metaphysical engineering that shapes the probability landscape, making a desired future not just possible, but the path of least resistance.

  The deliberate projection of a desired system geometry (a plan) onto the future manifold. This act 'pre-carves' a Wound Channel, creating a new path of least resistance (a geodesic) intended to maximize the system's Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ) and minimize resistance from Environmental Temporal Pressure (V_Œì), thus guiding the future flow of action along the intended path.

          Observe the system's execution dynamics post-imprinting. Classify the flow state of operations as Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant. A successful imprint is validated by the emergence and persistence of Laminar Execution.

    excerpt: |
      A plan is an act of deliberate **coherence imprinting**‚Äîa projection of a desired geometry onto the local manifold of what is to come. By defining goals, allocating resources, and sequencing actions, the planner "pre-carves" a Wound Channel into the future. This channel creates a new path of least resistance.
  - module: DOMA-162
    excerpt: |
      A truly resilient strategy is an **adaptive geodesic**‚Äîa continuous process of sensing changes in the environmental pressure (V_Œì) and re-calculating the path of maximal coherence in real time. The goal is not to adhere to the original plan, but to adhere to the *principle of maximal coherence*, dynamically adjusting the path to maintain a state of Laminar Flow.

        Coherence Imprinting is the act of defining a system (K_œÑ) and its environment (V_Œì) such that a desired future trajectory becomes the path that extremizes the Pirouette Action (S = ‚à´ùìõ_plan dt). This is conceptually identical to the Principle of Least Action, which states that a physical system's dynamics evolve along a path that extremizes its action. The imprint effectively engineers the Lagrangian so the desired path *is* the path of least action.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'planning'. Planning often refers to the creation of a static document. Coherence Imprinting is the dynamic, continuous act of projecting and maintaining a coherent path in the future. It is not about creating a map, but about shaping the terrain itself.

# Coherence Imprinting

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The deliberate projection of a desired system geometry (a plan) onto the future manifold. This act 'pre-carves' a Wound Channel, creating a new path of least resistance (a geodesic) intended to maximize the system's Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ) and minimize resistance from Environmental Temporal Pressure (V_Œì), thus guiding the future flow of action along the intended path.

## EFT-First Summary
Coherence Imprinting is conceptually mapped to the **Principle of Least Action**. It is the act of defining a system's "Lagrangian" (its internal coherence minus external pressures) such that a desired future evolution becomes the natural trajectory‚Äîthe path of least action. Just as a particle follows a geodesic through spacetime, a well-planned system follows the geodesic of maximal coherence carved by the imprint.
