triad:
  art: |
    Most invented mathematics is a beautiful but empty net. Load-bearing math is the specific mesh that the loom of reality itself uses, the pattern that catches and stabilizes the threads of time.
  law: |
    An invented formalism is physically load-bearing if and only if it passes all three gates of the Pirouette-Compliance Test (PCT): SR stability, Σ-map compatibility without new free parameters, and production of new, falsifiable predictions.
  philosophy: |
    This concept rejects mathematical Platonism in favor of a co-evolutionary view. It provides a diagnostic tool to distinguish between formalisms that are merely descriptive conveniences and those that participate in the substrate's own dynamics, acting as a "stabilizer grammar."
pirouette_definition: |
  A quality of an invented mathematical formalism indicating that it can be used by the physical substrate to structure its dynamics. Operationally, a formalism is deemed physically load-bearing if it has high Stickiness (Stk), and passes all three gates of the Pirouette-Compliance Test (PCT-1, PCT-2, PCT-3). Such formalisms successfully embed into the system's dynamics without requiring ad-hoc constants and yield new, testable consequences.
operational_definition:
  units: Binary predicate (passes/fails PCT) and dimensionless score (Stickiness, Stk).
  symbol_table:
    - name: PCT
      meaning: Pirouette-Compliance Test, a three-gate binary check for SR-stability, Σ-compatibility, and falsifiability.
      dimensions: dimensionless

    - name: Stk(D)
      meaning: Stickiness, a weighted score quantifying a formalism's compatibility with the physical system via Σ-Compatibility, Stabilizer Yield, Compression Power, and Predictive Leverage.

        outline: |
          1.  **SR Gate (PCT-1):** Verify that the formalism's invariants are stable under SR-0...6 transformations and preserve CPM.
          2.  **Σ Gate (PCT-2):** Push the formalism through the spatialization map Σ and confirm it supports known gauge/geometrical structures without inflating the constant ledger (no new tunable knobs).
          3.  **Falsifiability Gate (PCT-3):** Confirm the formalism produces at least one new, testable prediction with a clear null hypothesis and kill-switch condition.

context_windows:
  - module: MATH-PHI-001
    excerpt: |
      Mathematics is invented syntax exploring many possible grammars. Pirouette selects the fragments whose invariants stabilize the temporal medium: these fragments behave like a stabilizer grammar for SR-0…6. We call this selective adhesion stickiness. It is not a theological claim that “all math exists”; it’s a diagnostic for which invented formalisms become physically load-bearing.
  - module: MATH-PHI-001
    excerpt: |
      Any domain with Stk ≥ 0.6 and RPA ≥ τ is promoted to “pirouette” and may modify children modules; else remains a helper. This provides a formal CI gate for elevating a mathematical tool from a mere calculational scaffold to a candidate component of the system's core operational grammar.

      equation_hint:
      justification: |
        A well-posed problem (existence, uniqueness, stability of solution) is a mathematical requirement for a physical model to be predictive. It's a form of load-bearing, ensuring the formalism doesn't "break" under physical conditions.

  adopted:
    - target: Renormalizability
      domain: QFT
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      rationale: |
        The analogy is strong: both are non-obvious mathematical constraints that a formal theory must satisfy to be considered physically viable and predictive, rather than just a descriptive model. Renormalizability acts as a powerful selection principle on the space of all possible theories, just as being load-bearing selects from the space of all possible mathematics.

    This term refers to the capacity of a *formalism* to support the structure of physical laws, not the capacity of a *physical object* to support weight. It is a measure of a formalism's "ontological fitness" for a given physical world.

# Physically load-bearing

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A quality of an invented mathematical formalism indicating that it can be used by the physical substrate to structure its dynamics. Operationally, a formalism is deemed physically load-bearing if it has high Stickiness (Stk), and passes all three gates of the Pirouette-Compliance Test (PCT-1, PCT-2, PCT-3). Such formalisms successfully embed into the system's dynamics without requiring ad-hoc constants and yield new, testable consequences.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of effective field theory, this concept is analogous to principles like renormalizability or locality that select viable Lagrangians. A formalism is "load-bearing" if it provides a consistent, predictive, and non-fine-tuned description of dynamics, much like a renormalizable QFT provides a stable framework for computation across energy scales. It's a criterion for determining which mathematical structures are part of the fundamental "operating system" versus those that are merely useful high-level "apps." See formal mapping to Renormalizability.
