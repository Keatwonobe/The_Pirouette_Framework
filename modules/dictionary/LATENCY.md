        1.  **Latency (The Quiet Search):** In the immediate aftermath, the system's coherence is shattered. Its internal Ki pattern is chaotic, its echoes scattered. There is little outward change, but a profound internal search is underway. The system is probing the contours of the new, scarred coherence manifold, feeling for a stable gradient—a viable path forward.

  art: |
    The silence after a bell is struck; not an absence, but the unheard gathering of scattered echoes into the potential for a new note. It is the deep, still breath taken before the song can begin again.
  law: |
    The duration of the Latency phase (τ_L) is the time required for a system to find a viable new geodesic on its post-collapse coherence manifold. During this phase, net external work is zero; all energetic expenditure is internal, manifesting as a high-entropy search detectable by its characteristic coherence fluctuations.
  philosophy: |
    Latency asserts that recovery is not a mechanical reflex but a creative search. It prioritizes finding the *right* path over finding *any* path, teaching that strategic inaction is a profound form of action when navigating a fundamentally changed reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  Latency is the initial, internally-focused temporal phase of systemic recovery following a collapse. Characterized by low mean Temporal Coherence (Kτ) and minimal external change, it is a period of high-entropy search where the system probes the post-collapse coherence manifold, guided by the geometric memory of its Wound Channel, to identify a viable geodesic for re-establishing Laminar Flow. The phase ends at the onset of exponential coherence growth, which marks the beginning of the Acceleration phase.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline of the system's mean Temporal Coherence (Kτ) and its variance in a stable state (Laminar Flow).
          2. Induce a collapse event (a Γ spike) and record the timestamp of decoherence.
          3. Monitor Kτ post-collapse. The Latency phase is the time interval during which mean Kτ remains near zero, but its variance is significantly higher than the baseline noise floor.
          4. The phase ends (τ_L is measured) at the point where Kτ begins a sustained, exponential increase, marking the onset of Acceleration.

    excerpt: |
      A system's collapse is the shattering of its song. The silence that follows is not an ending, but a question. This module reframes the phenomenon of "rebound" from a mechanical response into a profound act of re-creation. Recovery is the process by which a system... navigates the landscape of possibility to find a new rhythm.

      justification: |
        In classical nucleation theory, the incubation or nucleation time is the stochastic period required for a stable nucleus of a new thermodynamic phase to form via random fluctuations within a metastable parent phase. Latency is functionally identical: it is the time a system spends exploring its new state space (the coherence manifold) to "nucleate" a stable dynamic pattern (a new Ki) before macroscopic, directed recovery (Acceleration) can begin.

      falsifier: "Consistent observation of a system that, post-collapse, immediately enters an exponential recovery (Acceleration) with τ_L = 0. This would imply recovery is a purely mechanical reflex, not a search process."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'stagnation' or 'system death'. Latency is an active, high-entropy process characterized by internal coherence fluctuations. System death is a decay to a low-energy, quiescent state where such fluctuations cease and trend toward thermal noise.
