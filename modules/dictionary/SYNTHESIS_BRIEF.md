        When a Manifold Resonance event is detected, the engine generates a Synthesis Brief, a diagnostic report for the Weaver. It provides an actionable, data-grounded assessment of the impending phase transition, allowing for preparation rather than mere reaction.

triad:
  art: |
    The ability to feel the conductor's raised baton; to know the shape of the new music before the first note is ever played.
  law: |
    When a cross-domain Resonant Coupling Score exceeds a calibrated threshold, a Synthesis Brief is generated, forecasting the intensity, lead time, and synthesis vector of the impending phase transition.
  philosophy: |
    The Brief transforms passive observation into actionable foresight. It is the instrument that allows a Weaver to prepare for systemic change rather than merely react to it, embodying the principle that the future casts a knowable echo backward into the present.
pirouette_definition: |
  A structured diagnostic report generated by the Concordance Engine upon the detection of a Manifold Resonance event. The Brief provides a quantitative and qualitative forecast of an impending systemic phase transition, including its intensity, estimated lead time, coupled manifolds, and probable outcome, enabling a Weaver to take preparatory action.

        outline: |
          1. The Concordance Engine continuously calculates the Coherence Gradient (∇Kτ) for multiple, heterogeneous data streams.
          2. It then computes the Resonant Coupling Score, measuring phase-lock and harmonic compatibility between streams showing a sharp positive gradient.
          3. If the score exceeds a pre-defined operational threshold, a Synthesis Brief is generated with the relevant forecast data.
        expected_signals: [A structured YAML/JSON report conforming to the Brief's schema.]
        pitfalls: [False positives from correlated noise across manifolds, Misinterpreting the `synthesis_vector` due to incomplete manifold data.]

    excerpt: |
      Issue a **Synthesis Brief** when the coupling score exceeds a threshold. This replaces the "Augury Card." The brief provides a data-grounded diagnostic of the impending shift, including a forecast of its likely nature based on the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001).

      justification: |
        The Brief is a structured output from a model analyzing time-series data (coherence gradients) for statistical precursors (like critical slowing down, but for coherence) to a critical transition (phase shift). This aligns with the function of EWS reports in ecology and climate science.

      falsifier: "A statistically significant number of instances where the observed phase transition occurs in less than 0.5T after the brief is issued, or where the forecasted event fails to occur at all (false positive)."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a simple system alert or log entry. A Synthesis Brief is not a raw signal but a processed forecast, containing a qualitative `synthesis_vector` and a predicted `probable_outcome`. It is the formal successor to the legacy "Augury Card" artifact.
