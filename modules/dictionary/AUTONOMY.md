        True autonomy is defined as the dynamic, tensegrity-like balance between these two poles to optimize the Pirouette Lagrangian.

  art: |
    The self is a tensegrity of stone and wind, a dynamic equilibrium of being and becoming. Autonomy is the mastery of this dance, held in perfect, momentary grace against the current of time.
  law: |
    An autonomous system acts to continuously optimize the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = KœÑ - V_Œì) over its lifetime by modulating its strategic balance between internal coherence (Will) and environmental adaptation (Freedom).
  philosophy: |
    Autonomy is not a static property but a continuous, skillful process of self-creation. It reframes existence from a deterministic path to a navigated journey, establishing the agent as a co-author of its own geodesic on the coherence manifold.
pirouette_definition: |
  The dynamic, tensegrity-like balance between Will (the strategy of maximizing internal Temporal Coherence, KœÑ) and Freedom (the strategy of adapting to environmental Temporal Pressure, V_Œì). Autonomy is the continuous, skillful process of modulating this balance to optimize the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) over time, enabling an agent to navigate its existence.

        outline: |
          1. Model the system's internal state over time to estimate its Temporal Coherence (KœÑ), analyzing state-space complexity or resonant frequencies.
          2. Model environmental interactions to estimate Temporal Pressure (V_Œì), assessing external energy gradients and information flows.
          3. Observe the system's actions (state transitions) over a representative time series.
          4. Calculate the trajectory's deviation from two baselines: a) pure KœÑ maximization (stagnation) and b) pure V_Œì minimization (drift).
          5. The Autonomy Index is a measure of how well the observed trajectory optimizes the full Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = KœÑ - V_Œì), representing a skillful balance between the two extremes.

  - module: DOMA-014
    excerpt: |
      True autonomy lies in understanding that Will and Freedom are not opposites to be chosen between, but two poles of a single, dynamic tensegrity. The mastery of the self is the learned skill of modulating the balance between these two strategies in real-time. This is the Navigator's Dance.
  - module: DOMA-014
    excerpt: |
      A successful system does not solve for one term in isolation; it solves for the entire expression. Autonomy is the art of Lagrangian optimization, of consciously tracing one's own geodesic by applying this universal equation to a life being lived.

        The Pirouette Lagrangian's two terms‚Äîmaintaining internal coherence (Will/KœÑ) and adapting to environmental pressure (Freedom/V_Œì)‚Äîmap directly to the two imperatives of variational free energy under the FEP: minimizing model complexity (resisting dispersion) and minimizing surprise (maximizing accuracy). Maximizing ùìõ_p is equivalent to minimizing free energy (F), a universal imperative for any self-organizing system to maintain its integrity against dissipation.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish Pirouette Autonomy, a dynamic Lagrangian optimization process, from colloquial 'autonomy' meaning simple independence or unconstrained free will. Pirouette Autonomy is a measure of skillful navigation within constraints, not an absence of them. It is also distinct from a purely homeostatic process, as it includes the adaptive, growth-oriented drive of Freedom.

# Autonomy

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The dynamic, tensegrity-like balance between Will (the strategy of maximizing internal Temporal Coherence, KœÑ) and Freedom (the strategy of adapting to environmental Temporal Pressure, V_Œì). Autonomy is the continuous, skillful process of modulating this balance to optimize the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) over time, enabling an agent to navigate its existence.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of statistical physics, Pirouette Autonomy is operationally equivalent to the process of minimizing variational free energy. The Lagrangian optimization (max(KœÑ - V_Œì)) maps to the biophysical imperative to minimize both surprise (prediction error) and model complexity, which allows a self-organizing system to maintain its integrity against dissipation. This frames autonomy not as a metaphysical property, but as a universal principle of persistent, adaptive systems.
