  art: |
    The rot that grows in the shadow of monuments. The brittleness of an overstretched tapestry, where the weight of its own magnificent pattern becomes the source of its unraveling.
  law: |
    A system's internal coherence accelerates its own decay at a rate proportional to the product of its power (Γ) and its extant decoherence (1 − Tₐ). Power amplifies internal flaws into systemic collapse.
  philosophy: |
    This dynamic enforces a critical lesson of history: unchecked growth and overextension breed fragility. It ensures that simulations account for the endogenous, self-sabotaging tendencies of complex systems, preventing naive models of indefinite power accumulation.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dynamic overlay applied to a Pirouette Engine actor that models endogenous decay due to overextension and internal fragility. It introduces a negative term to the second derivative of Time-Adherence (Ta_ddot), making a system's stability degrade faster as its power (Γ) and instability (1 - Tₐ) increase. This feedback loop represents the process by which a large, powerful system's own scale and internal contradictions become the primary driver of its collapse.

      - name: Historical System Inference
        outline: |
          1. Model a historical empire or modern state as a Pirouette Engine actor.
          2. Compile time-series data for proxies of Gladiator Force (Γ), e.g., GDP, energy consumption, military mass.
          3. Compile time-series data for proxies of Time-Adherence (Tₐ), e.g., political stability indices, measures of social trust, factional violence incidence.
          4. Calculate the second derivative of the Tₐ time-series.
          5. Perform a regression to determine if a significant portion of the negative change in `d²Tₐ/dt²` is explained by the term `kᵣ * Γ * (1 - Tₐ)`.
        expected_signals: [A statistically significant negative correlation between `d²Tₐ/dt²` and the interaction term `Γ * (1 - Tₐ)` during periods of imperial decline.]
        pitfalls: [Difficulty in acquiring high-fidelity, commensurable data for Tₐ and Γ across different historical periods. Confounding variables, such as external coherence attacks or environmental shocks, may obscure the signal.]

    excerpt: |
      We want to overlay the dynamics of rome collapsing onto the US, which in my opinion is fairly accurate but in the information domain instead of geographic and national, then we want to overlay the climate crisis, then we want to overlay coherence warfare.
  - module: PDM-003_the_colosseum
    excerpt: |
      The future depicted is one of profound, cascading crises. The initial phase (2025-2040) is marked by intense but non-kinetic Coherence Warfare, where the USA's stability ($T_a$) is systematically degraded. The middle phase (2040-2070) is defined by two simultaneous events: the outbreak of Kinetic War and the catastrophic failure of the Biosphere, which cripples all nations.

  evocative_lines:
    - "The collapse of Rome, the climate crisis and coherence warfare unite in this period of history we are in now."
    - "It lashes out at the Multipolar Bloc, which it perceives as the primary source of its destabilization."

        dx/dt = ... - k * x * (P - x)
      justification: |
        The overlay acts as a powerful negative feedback loop where the decay rate of a variable (Tₐ) is amplified by another system variable (Γ). It is functionally similar to self-limiting terms in population dynamics or reaction kinetics, but applied to the abstract space of systemic stability.

  disambiguation: |
    The Roman Collapse Overlay must be distinguished from Coherence Warfare. Coherence Warfare is an external attack on a system's Tₐ by another actor. This overlay is an internal, self-generated decay dynamic that is a function of the system's own state (its Γ and Tₐ), requiring no external actor.
