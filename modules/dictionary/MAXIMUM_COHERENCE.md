  art: |
    A web of coherent flows settles into its most stable form, and from this global choice, its intrinsic pressure and surface tension are born as universal constants.
  law: |
    The pressure scale (`α`) and `D_eff`-dimensional surface tension (`σ`) of the superfluid are not free parameters; they are fixed constants, analogous to Lagrange multipliers, determined by the same symmetry-breaking that selects the effective spatial dimension (`D_eff`) of the coherence network.
  philosophy: |
    MaxCo elevates the theory from descriptive to predictive by replacing tunable parameters (`α`, `σ`) with a foundational principle rooted in symmetry and network topology. It unifies the origin of the fluid's bulk pressure and interface tension.
pirouette_definition: |
  A constrained variational principle that selects the ground state configuration of the superfluid coherence network. Maximizing a coherence functional over possible network geometries (topologies characterized by `D_eff`) fixes the Pressuron pressure scale (`α`) and the network's surface tension (`σ`) as non-tunable, universal constants for a given regime.
operational_definition:
  units: Principle (dimensionless). Its outputs, `α` and `σ`, have context-dependent dimensions.

        outline: |
          Fit the superfluid halo model, with `β` fixed by `D_eff` and `z`, to a large population of galaxy rotation curves or cluster profiles. Infer the best-fit universal values for `α` and `σ`. A successful application would yield a single value of `α` for all systems within the same `D_eff` regime.

    excerpt: |
      From MaxCo (maximum coherence) as a constrained variational principle, the Gladiator feedback term fixes the overall pressure scale α; the surface tension σ arises as a boundary functional on the D_eff‑dimensional network (a Gibbons–Hawking‑like term for interfaces in the effective theory). Both α and σ are Lagrange‑multiplier–like constants determined by the same symmetry breaking that selects D_eff.

      domain: CM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        MaxCo is a variational principle that selects a preferred physical state (the ground state of the coherence network) by extremizing a functional. This is methodologically identical to principles like minimum energy for mechanical systems or maximum entropy for thermodynamical systems, which also serve to determine the equilibrium state and its associated parameters.

    - target: Gibbons–Hawking–York boundary term
      domain: GR
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The module explicitly likens the surface tension `σ` derived from MaxCo to a "Gibbons–Hawking-like term" for interfaces. This suggests MaxCo provides an effective action where `σ` plays the role of a boundary term required for a well-posed variational problem on the `D_eff`-dimensional coherence network.

  claims:
    - statement: "The pressure scale `α` and surface tension `σ` are universal constants for a given (`D_eff`, `z`) regime, determined by the MaxCo principle."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "If astrophysical observations require different values of `α` for objects believed to be in the same `D_eff` regime (e.g., `β=1/2` spiral galaxies of different masses), the principle is falsified."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The term "coherence" is used broadly in physics (e.g., quantum coherence, coherence length).]
  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, Maximum Coherence is not a measure of a state's quantum coherence but a *variational principle* that selects a global network configuration. It operates on the emergent, classical field of the superfluid, not its quantum constituents directly.
