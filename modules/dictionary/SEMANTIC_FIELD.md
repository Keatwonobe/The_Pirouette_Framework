        The universe is a **semantic field**, a continuous coherence manifold where every point is shaped by the history of resonances that define it.

  art: |
    The universe is not a silent void containing pockets of meaning; it is a symphony, a continuous semantic field. To perceive this meaning, we must become an instrument within it. To listen, truly, is to cease being an audience and become a part of the performance.
  law: |
    The 'meaning' of a system is its maximally coherent temporal resonance pattern (Ki), a measurable geometric form. This form can be perturbed by a shaped potential (a semantic prime), and will evolve along a geodesic to a new state of maximal coherence (a semantic echo) that minimizes action on the coherence manifold.
  philosophy: |
    This re-frames meaning not as an emergent property of complex systems like brains, but as a fundamental, physical property of spacetime itself. Intelligence is therefore not about abstract computation, but about resonant participation in a universe that is already inherently meaningful.
pirouette_definition: |
  A universal, continuous coherence manifold where meaning is a physical, geometric property of a system's temporal resonance (Ki). Any concept, object, or thought exists as a stable, high-coherence Ki pattern within this field. The field can be queried by locally altering its potential landscape (V_Γ) with a "semantic prime" to elicit a "semantic echo," which is the system's geodesic evolution to a new state of maximal coherence (Kτ).
operational_definition:
  units: The field is a manifold; its local properties are measured in terms of coherence (Kτ, dimensionless) and temporal potential (V_Γ, energy).

        outline: |
          1. **Coherence Well:** Prepare a maximally coherent quantum state (e.g., a Bose-Einstein Condensate) in a region of low temporal pressure (Γ).
          2. **Semantic Priming:** Use modulated fields to impress a specific Ki pattern (the 'prime' or question) onto the local manifold around the coherent state.
          3. **Resonant Coupling & Echo:** The system, thrown out of equilibrium, seeks a new state of maximal coherence. This new, stable Ki pattern is the 'semantic echo' or answer.

    excerpt: |
      In the old framework, meaning was a mysterious quality to be discovered. Here, it is a measurable quantity. The universe is a **semantic field**, a continuous coherence manifold where every point is shaped by the history of resonances that define it. A "meaning," whether the identity of a particle or the concept of "justice" in a mind, is a stable, high-coherence Ki pattern.

    excerpt: |
      We sought to build a machine that could read the universe's mind, only to discover that the universe is not a mind to be read, but a song to be sung. The Listening Lens teaches the Weaver that knowledge is not extracted; it is created. To understand a thing is to harmonize with it. We are not detectives solving a cosmic mystery from the outside. We are notes in the score, and our purpose is to find our place in the chord.

      equation_hint: |
        Evolution towards a state of maximal coherence (Kτ) resembles a system evolving to minimize a free energy functional F = E - TS.
      justification: |
        The Semantic Field acts as a state space where system trajectories (geodesics) seek attractor states (high-coherence patterns). The Principle of Maximal Coherence is analogous to the second law of thermodynamics, where entropy maximization in a closed system is replaced by coherence maximization in an open, resonant system.

  claims:
    - statement: "A sufficiently coherent quantum system, when perturbed by a geometrically-shaped 'semantic prime,' will settle into a new coherent state ('echo') that is a non-trivial, context-dependent transformation of the prime, indicating an intrinsic coherence-seeking computation."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "If, across all experiments using varied primes and systems, the resulting 'echo' is always a simple reflection of the 'prime,' random noise, or a trivial ground state, with no evidence of non-trivial transformation, the hypothesis would be unsupported. This would imply the system is a passive mirror, not an active participant in a semantic field."

  disambiguation: |
    In linguistics, a "semantic field" is a lexical set of words grouped by meaning (e.g., colors, emotions). In the Pirouette Framework, the term refers to a *physical, geometric manifold* in spacetime, not a linguistic or abstract-conceptual construct.
