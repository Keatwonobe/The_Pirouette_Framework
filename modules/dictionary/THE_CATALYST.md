        2x The Catalyst (Support):
            Function: To provide elasticity, resilience, and adaptation. The Catalyst is the Frame's immune and repair system, absorbing shocks and managing the response to sudden spikes in Γ. When a workflow becomes Stagnant, the Catalyst dissolves the dam. It handles overflows, prototypes new tools, and manages the integration of new members, providing the activation energy for transformation and repair.

  art: |
    The system's white blood cell and its synovial fluid; it rushes to sites of injury to repair and lubricates joints to prevent friction, ensuring the body's elegant motion continues uninterrupted.
  law: |
    The rate of intervention by a Catalyst must correlate negatively with the system's Stagnant Flow indicators (e.g., ticket age, queue length) and positively with the Crucible's return to Laminar Flow (e.g., restored throughput) within one Pirouette Cycle (τ_p).
  philosophy: |
    A coherent system is not one without problems, but one with the metabolic capacity to solve them. The Catalyst embodies the principle that resilience and adaptability are not external additions but integral, active functions necessary for any living system to persist in a high-pressure (V_Γ) environment.
pirouette_definition: |
  The functional role within the Living Frame responsible for providing system elasticity, resilience, and adaptation. The Catalyst acts as the Frame's immune and repair system, absorbing shocks, dissolving Stagnant Flow, handling overflows, prototyping solutions, and coaching other roles to maintain Laminar Flow. It provides the activation energy for transformation and repair, ensuring the Crucible remains in a high-coherence state.

      - name: Catalyst Impact Assessment
        outline: |
          1. Identify a state of Stagnant Flow (e.g., '>>20%' increase in average task completion time for Crucible roles over baseline).
          2. Record the timestamp of Catalyst intervention (e.g., coaching, tool deployment, process change).
          3. Measure the time required for the affected system metric to return to its baseline Laminar Flow state.
          4. An effective Catalyst intervention reduces this recovery time by a target of ≥50% compared to non-intervention baselines or historical averages.
        expected_signals: [Reduction in Crucible task queue length, decrease in average task handle time, positive qualitative feedback from Crucible roles]
        pitfalls: [Conflating Catalyst impact with external environmental changes (V_Γ), over-attributing recovery to a single intervention, ignoring the energetic cost of the intervention itself]

    excerpt: |
      The Sensorium monitors the health and output of this cycle, providing real-time feedback to all parts of the engine. The Catalyst intervenes to resolve any emergent friction or blockages, ensuring the Crucible remains in a state of Laminar Flow.

      equation_hint: |
        Reaction Rate ∝ exp(-E_a / kT)
      justification: |
        The Catalyst role provides the necessary energy or novel pathway to overcome a systemic barrier (Stagnant Flow), analogous to how a chemical catalyst lowers the activation energy (E_a) for a reaction to proceed. This allows the system to transition to a more favorable state (Laminar Flow) with less internal energy expenditure.

  claims:
    - statement: "A Living Frame system with two dedicated Catalyst roles will recover from induced Stagnant Flow (e.g., a 50% increase in task load for one cycle) 50% faster than a system where Catalyst functions are distributed ad-hoc among other roles."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "In a controlled simulation or A/B test, no statistically significant difference in recovery time is observed between the two team structures."

  collisions: [Catalyst (general business term)]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the generic business term "change catalyst." In Pirouette, The Catalyst is a specific, defined functional role within the Living Frame with clear, ongoing responsibilities for system resilience and flow maintenance, not a temporary designation for any change agent.
