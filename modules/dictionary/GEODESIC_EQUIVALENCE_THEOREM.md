        When we substitute our geometric Lagrangian L_p = (1/2) * g_ij(phi) * d(phi)^i/dt * d(phi)^j/dt - V(phi) into the Euler-Lagrange equation and perform the differentiations, the resulting equation of motion is precisely the geodesic equation... The Euler-Lagrange equations are the geodesic equations.

    The law is the landscape. A system's path is not compelled by outside forces, but is the straightest, easiest line it can draw across the curved terrain of its own possibilities.

    The Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for a system described by the Pirouette Lagrangian `L_p = K_τ - V` are mathematically identical to the geodesic equations on the Coherence Manifold, whose metric `g_ij` is derived from the kinetic term `K_τ`.
  philosophy: |
    This theorem grounds the central claim that "force" is an illusion arising from a limited perspective. It replaces the notion of external pushes and pulls with the intrinsic geometry of a system's phase space, making dynamics a direct consequence of that geometry.

  The theorem stating that the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian, `L_p = (1/2)g_ij(φ)φ̇^iφ̇^j - V(φ, Γ)`, are identical to the geodesic equation `d²φ^k/dt² + Γ^k_ij φ̇^iφ̇^j = 0` on the Coherence Manifold. The manifold's metric `g_ij` is defined by the kinetic term, and its curvature and conformal warping (from `V`) fully encode the dynamics typically attributed to forces.

          A mathematical proof, not a physical measurement.
          1. Define the Pirouette Lagrangian `L_p` for a system.
          2. Compute the Euler-Lagrange equations: `d/dt (∂L_p/∂φ̇^k) - ∂L_p/∂φ^k = 0`.
          3. Define the Coherence Metric `g_ij` from the kinetic term of `L_p`.
          4. Compute the Christoffel symbols `Γ^k_ij` from `g_ij`.
          5. Show that the equation from step 2 is identical to the geodesic equation `φ̈^k + Γ^k_ij φ̇^iφ̇^j = 0`, where the potential gradient `∂V/∂φ^k` is absorbed as a geometric term.

    excerpt: |
      This module provides the deeper, geometric proof. We will now formally construct the Coherence Manifold—the space of all possible Ki rhythms—as a Riemannian manifold. By defining a metric... we will prove that the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion are mathematically identical to the geodesic equation on this manifold. This act cements the framework's geometric interpretation of reality, showing that a system's trajectory is not determined by "force," but by the shortest path through the curved landscape of its own possible states.
  - module: MATH-005
    excerpt: |
      This proves that a system following the Principle of Maximal Coherence is, by definition, following the straightest possible path through the curved geometry of its own phase space. What we perceive as "force" is simply the curvature of this underlying reality.

        In General Relativity, test particles follow geodesics in spacetime curved by mass-energy. This theorem makes an analogous claim for the abstract "phase space" of a system, where the Coherence Manifold is curved by the system's own kinetic and potential properties. What we perceive as 'forces' are manifestations of this intrinsic curvature.

    This theorem is conceptually analogous to the Geodesic Principle in General Relativity, but it is not the same. The GR principle applies to particle motion in physical spacetime. The Pirouette theorem applies to a system's trajectory through its abstract phase space (the Coherence Manifold), re-interpreting all internal forces as geometry.

# Geodesic Equivalence Theorem

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The theorem stating that the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian, `L_p = (1/2)g_ij(φ)φ̇^iφ̇^j - V(φ, Γ)`, are identical to the geodesic equation `d²φ^k/dt² + Γ^k_ij φ̇^iφ̇^j = 0` on the Coherence Manifold. The manifold's metric `g_ij` is defined by the kinetic term, and its curvature and conformal warping (from `V`) fully encode the dynamics typically attributed to forces.

## EFT-First Summary
Analogous to the Geodesic Principle in General Relativity, this theorem demonstrates that a system's equations of motion are equivalent to the path of a free particle on a curved surface. The 'metric' of this surface (the Coherence Manifold) is determined by the system's kinetic terms, and apparent 'forces' are manifestations of the surface's intrinsic curvature. This powerful mathematical tool recasts dynamics as a problem in pure geometry.
