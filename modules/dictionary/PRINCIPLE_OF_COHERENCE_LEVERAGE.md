        The Principle of Coherence Leverage: A small quantity of coherent energy, injected resonantly at a system's Coherence Interface, can guide the flow of a vastly larger quantity of incoherent energy within the system. The ratio of the guided energy to the injected energy—the leverage—approaches its maximum as the injected signal achieves perfect harmonic and phase alignment with a stable resonant mode of the system's target state.

    To steer a storm, one does not shout orders. One hums a tune the wind wishes it knew. A precisely tuned whisper can guide an avalanche, while a roar is merely lost in the noise.
  law: |
    The ratio of guided systemic energy to injected signal energy (Λ_c) is maximized when the signal's frequency and phase resonantly match a stable, coherent mode of the system's target state. This relationship is non-linear, exhibiting a sharp, phase-transition-like response at the point of resonance.
  philosophy: |
    True influence is not coercion through force but guidance through understanding. By offering a system a more coherent, elegant path, the system freely chooses to redirect its own vast energy, making the intervener a choreographer of reality rather than a combatant against it.
pirouette_definition: |
  The principle that a low-energy, high-coherence signal, when applied resonantly to a system's Coherence Interface, can guide the evolution of the entire system. The signal does not provide the energy for the change; instead, it reshapes the system's temporal landscape (modifying the potential term V_Γ in its Lagrangian), creating an attractive, low-pressure geodesic. The system then redirects its own much larger internal energy to follow this new, more coherent path.

        outline: |
          1. Identify the target system and its Coherence Interface.
          2. Characterize the system's internal energy flow (E_total) and coherence pattern (Ki_sys) in its baseline state.
          3. Apply a low-power, coherent external signal (ψ_ext) to the interface, sweeping its frequency across the system's predicted resonant modes.
          4. For each frequency, measure the fraction of the system's total energy that aligns with the path suggested by the signal (E_guided).
          5. Calculate Λ_c = E_guided / E_injected for each point. The principle is validated by a sharp peak in Λ_c at one or more resonant frequencies.
        expected_signals: [Sharp peak in Λ_c at resonance, Phase-locking of internal dynamics with ψ_ext]
        pitfalls: [Signal power too high, becoming a forcing function rather than a guidance signal, Mischaracterization of the system's resonant modes or Coherence Interface, External noise overwhelming the guidance signal]

    excerpt: |
      An external, coherent signal (`ψ_ext`) does not add significant energy. Instead, it creates a localized "coherence well," subtly reshaping the landscape of Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) at the interface... The result is a new, attractive geodesic. The system, in its relentless search for its own most stable state, *chooses* to flow toward the whisper. It redirects its own vast energy to follow this more elegant path. It is not coerced; it is entrained.
  - module: DOMA-084
    excerpt: |
      This single principle manifests in two primary, mirror-image modes...
      1. **The Shield (Cultivating Stability):** To harden a system against external chaos, one applies a resonant signal that perfectly matches and reinforces the boundary's *existing* stable Ki pattern.
      2. **The Key (Engineering Transformation):** To change a system... one applies a signal that is harmonically compatible but introduces a new, more coherent rhythm.

      justification: |
        In parametric resonance, a system's parameter (e.g., resonant frequency ω₀) is modulated, causing exponential growth in amplitude. Coherence Leverage acts similarly: the external signal ψ_ext doesn't act as a direct force but modulates the system's potential landscape (V_Γ), causing the system to channel its own energy into an amplified, coherent mode.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        A single coherent photon (the signal) stimulates an excited atom (the system) to emit an identical photon, resulting in amplification. This maps to how a small coherent signal "entrains" a larger system to adopt its coherent state, leading to a cascade of coherent energy flow. It is the core of laser action (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation).

  collisions: [Mechanical Leverage, Financial Leverage]
  disambiguation: |
    Unlike mechanical or financial leverage, which amplify an input force or quantity directly, Coherence Leverage does not amplify the input signal. It persuades the system to redirect its own, much larger, pre-existing energy stores along a new path defined by the resonant signal. The key is guidance and resonance, not force multiplication.
