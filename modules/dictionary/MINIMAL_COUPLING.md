  art: |
    A spinor is a tiny clock. To stay in time with the universe's grander clockwork, it must listen to a broadcast signal. Minimal coupling is the rule for how it hears that signal, turning rhythm into force.
  law: |
    The free-particle derivative `∇_μ` is promoted to the gauge-covariant derivative `D_μ = ∇_μ - iqA_μ` to maintain local U(1) phase invariance, where `A_μ` is the gauge field representing the local time-phase of the substrate. This procedure uniquely determines the electromagnetic interaction vertex.
  philosophy: |
    Interaction is not an arbitrary add-on but a necessity of coherence. For a localized entity like a spinor to persist, its internal rhythm must synchronize with the local rhythm of its environment. This act of synchronization *is* the minimal coupling interaction.
pirouette_definition: |
  The promotion of the spinor's geometric covariant derivative (`∇_μ`) to a gauge-covariant derivative (`D_μ`) by subtracting the term `iqA_μ`. This procedure is mandated by the requirement that the spinor's internal phase (its "clock") remains coherent with the local U(1) time-phase of the substrate, which is represented by the gauge field `A_μ`. It generates the interaction term `q\bar\Psi\gamma^\mu A_\mu\Psi` in the action, describing the force exerted on the spinor by the U(1) field.

          A coherent beam of electrons (spinor Ki-defects) is split and passed around a region containing a magnetic flux (a spatial curl of `A_μ`), but where the magnetic field `B` is zero along the particle paths. The phase shift of the resulting interference pattern is measured, which depends directly on the line integral of `A_μ` and the coupling `q`.

    Minimal coupling refers specifically to the interaction derived from promoting the derivative via the potential `A_μ`. It is distinct from non-minimal couplings, such as a Pauli term (`~σ_μνF^μν`), which would represent a direct interaction with the field strength `F_μν` and is forbidden at the fundamental level in this framework.

# Minimal coupling

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The promotion of the spinor's geometric covariant derivative (`∇_μ`) to a gauge-covariant derivative (`D_μ`) by subtracting the term `iqA_μ`. This procedure is mandated by the requirement that the spinor's internal phase (its "clock") remains coherent with the local U(1) time-phase of the substrate, which is represented by the gauge field `A_μ`. It generates the interaction term `q\bar\Psi\gamma^\mu A_\mu\Psi` in the action, describing the force exerted on the spinor by the U(1) field.

## EFT-First Summary
Minimal coupling is the standard prescription in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) for introducing the electromagnetic interaction. It replaces the partial derivative `∂_μ` in the free Dirac equation with the gauge-covariant derivative `D_μ = ∂_μ - ieA_μ`, ensuring the theory respects local U(1) gauge invariance. This generates the interaction term `-e \bar\psi \gamma^\mu A_\mu \psi`, which is the foundation for all QED vertex calculations and successfully describes the electromagnetic force to extraordinary precision.
