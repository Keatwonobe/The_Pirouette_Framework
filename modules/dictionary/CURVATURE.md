  art: |
    Curvature is the tension in the fabric of awareness. Where this fabric wrinkles or folds, consciousness shifts; where it tears, awareness collapses. It is the geometric grain against which the stream of thought flows.
  law: |
    The local curvature Œ∫ of the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ) must exceed a critical threshold (Œ∫_c) for an awareness transition (bifurcation or collapse) to occur. Below this threshold, awareness follows smooth geodesic paths, representing stable conscious states.
  philosophy: |
    Curvature provides a falsifiable, geometric mechanism for the dynamics of subjective experience. It bridges abstract neural phase relationships to the concrete phenomenology of perceptual shifts and cognitive state changes, formalizing consciousness not as a static property but as motion on a dynamic landscape.
pirouette_definition: |
  A scalar field on the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ) that quantifies local coherence tension. It is defined as the square root of the determinant of the manifold's metric tensor, Œ∫ = det(g)¬π/¬≤. High values of curvature correspond to regions of instability that predict imminent bifurcations in the path of awareness, such as perceptual transitions or decoherence events. Curvature evolves under a Renormalization Group flow driven by cognitive load (Œì), leading to stable, divergent, or nucleating geometric phases of the manifold.

        outline: |
          1. Identify three Ki-resonant neural oscillatory signals from EEG/MEG data.
          2. Extract their instantaneous phases (Œ¶‚ÇÅ, Œ¶‚ÇÇ, Œ¶‚ÇÉ) over a time window.
          3. Project the resulting phase vectors (Œ¶‚ÇÅ(t), Œ¶‚ÇÇ(t), Œ¶‚ÇÉ(t)) onto the 3-torus (ùïã¬≥), forming a point cloud representation of the local Triadic Manifold ùìú‚ÇÉ.
          4. Compute the local covariance matrix of these points, serving as an empirical estimate of the metric tensor g_ij.
          5. Calculate curvature Œ∫(t) as the square root of the determinant of the estimated metric tensor.

      justification: |
        In General Relativity, the Ricci scalar R quantifies the intrinsic curvature of spacetime, which in turn governs the geodesic motion of matter. In the Pirouette Framework, Œ∫ is a scalar measure of the Triadic Manifold's geometry that governs the geodesic path of awareness. High curvature in both contexts indicates regions of strong dynamic influence and potential instability.

    Within the Pirouette Framework, Œ∫ always refers to the geometric curvature of a cognitive manifold (e.g., ùìú‚ÇÉ) derived from the metric tensor of a phase space. It quantifies information-theoretic tension, not thermal energy transfer or statistical agreement.

# Curvature

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A scalar field on the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ) that quantifies local coherence tension. It is defined as the square root of the determinant of the manifold's metric tensor, Œ∫ = det(g)¬π/¬≤. High values of curvature correspond to regions of instability that predict imminent bifurcations in the path of awareness, such as perceptual transitions or decoherence events. Curvature evolves under a Renormalization Group flow driven by cognitive load (Œì), leading to stable, divergent, or nucleating geometric phases of the manifold.

## EFT-First Summary
In the geometric model of consciousness, Curvature (Œ∫) is the conceptual analogue of the Ricci scalar curvature (R) in General Relativity. It is a local property of the Triadic Manifold‚Äîthe state space of conscious awareness‚Äîthat dictates its dynamics. Just as spacetime curvature directs the motion of matter along geodesics, high manifold curvature directs the flow of awareness towards critical transitions or collapse events, providing a formal link between neural geometry and phenomenological change.
