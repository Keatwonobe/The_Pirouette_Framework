    A particle's mass is the echo of its unique resonance with the fine-grained torsion of the temporal substrate. Generations are but different harmonics in this deep cosmic song, each scaling differently with the universe's focus.
  law: |
    The fermion-torsion coupling constant, `y_Γ`, scales with the energy cutoff `Λ` as `y_Γ(Λ) ∝ Λ^ΔT`. A distinct `ΔT` for each fermion generation generates the observed mass hierarchy `m_f(i) / m_f(j) ∝ Λ^(ΔT(i) - ΔT(j))`.
  philosophy: |
    The Torsion Scaling Dimension replaces the arbitrary matrix of Yukawa couplings with a fundamental geometric principle. Mass is not an intrinsic property but a scale-dependent response to the substrate's torsional dynamics, explaining why particle families exist as distinct mass tiers.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Torsion Scaling Dimension, ΔT, is the anomalous scaling dimension of the fermion-torsion coupling constant `y_Γ` under renormalization group flow. As defined in XAP-006C, fermion masses `m_f` are proportional to `y_Γ`, so a unique `ΔT` for each fermion generation naturally produces the observed mass hierarchies without requiring a matrix of ad-hoc Yukawa couplings. ΔT quantifies how strongly a fermion's interaction with the Γ-field changes with energy scale.

          ΔT is not measured directly but is inferred by measuring the mass ratios of fermion generations at different energy scales (e.g., via precision collider experiments or cosmological observations). The running of these mass ratios with energy `Λ` would constrain the differences between the ΔT values for each generation.

# Torsion Scaling Dimension

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Torsion Scaling Dimension, ΔT, is the anomalous scaling dimension of the fermion-torsion coupling constant `y_Γ` under renormalization group flow. As defined in XAP-006C, fermion masses `m_f` are proportional to `y_Γ`, so a unique `ΔT` for each fermion generation naturally produces the observed mass hierarchies without requiring a matrix of ad-hoc Yukawa couplings. ΔT quantifies how strongly a fermion's interaction with the Γ-field changes with energy scale.

## EFT-First Summary
In Effective Field Theory, the Torsion Scaling Dimension `ΔT` corresponds to the anomalous dimension of the Standard Model Yukawa coupling. The Pirouette framework postulates that each fermion generation has a distinct `ΔT`, causing their respective masses to run differently with energy. This provides a dynamical origin for the observed mass hierarchy, replacing the matrix of arbitrary Yukawa couplings with a small set of scaling exponents derived from the substrate geometry.
