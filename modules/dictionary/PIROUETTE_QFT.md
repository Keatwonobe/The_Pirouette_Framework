        We work on flat space for the loop computation (curved effects are higher order here). Matter Lagrangian (relevant pieces):
        [ \mathcal L = (\partial C)^*(\partial C) + \tfrac12(\partial\Gamma)^2 - V(|C|^2,\Gamma) - e\,\bar\psi_\ell \gamma^\mu A_\mu \psi_\ell + \underbrace{g_\ell\,\Gamma\,\bar\psi_\ell\psi_\ell}_{\text{pressuron–lepton portal}} + \cdots ]
        We model the lepton as a Dirac field (\psi_\ell) ... and take a **Yukawa-type** portal to the pressuron (\Gamma).

  art: |
    The universe is a temporal forge, and particles are resonant bells. The Pirouette QFT is the study of how these bells ring, listening for the echoes of their own making and the dissonant hum of the forge's background fire.
  law: |
    The anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton (`a_ℓ`) receives a new contribution (`Δa_ℓ`) from a one-loop interaction with the Pressuron field. This contribution is calculable and scales with the square of a mass-dependent Yukawa-like coupling (`g_ℓ`) and the fine-structure constant (`α`).
  philosophy: |
    To model new physics by treating particles not as isolated entities, but as oscillators coupled to a dynamic background spacetime texture (Temporal Pressure). Its purpose is to provide a predictive, falsifiable explanation for precision anomalies by quantifying how a particle's internal rhythm is perturbed by this background.
pirouette_definition: |
  A quantum field theory (QFT) extending the Standard Model with a scalar Pressuron field (Γ), the quantum of the background Temporal Pressure. The framework posits a new, renormalizable Yukawa-type portal, `g_ℓ Γ ψ̄_ℓ ψ_ℓ`, coupling the Pressuron to Standard Model leptons (ψ_ℓ). The coupling strength `g_ℓ` is hypothesized to scale with lepton mass (`m_ℓ`), providing a mechanism to explain precision anomalies like the muon g-2 via a one-loop radiative correction.

        outline: |
          1. Calculate the one-loop "Pirouette Diagram" contribution (`Δa_ℓ`) to a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment using the framework's Feynman rules. The result is a function of the model parameters (`κ`, `p`, `m_Γ`).
          2. Compare this theoretical prediction against high-precision experimental measurements of `a_ℓ` from experiments (e.g., Fermilab Muon g-2).
          3. A successful fit for the muon anomaly must also remain consistent with the tighter experimental bounds from the electron anomaly (`Δa_e`).
        expected_signals:
          - A non-zero contribution `Δa_μ` matching the observed anomaly of ~2.5 x 10⁻⁹.
          - A much smaller, non-zero contribution `Δa_e` consistent with experimental null results.
        pitfalls:
          - The parameter space (`κ`, `p`, `m_Γ`) that fits the g-2 anomaly might be excluded by other constraints (e.g., fifth-force experiments, beam-dump searches).
          - Higher-order loop corrections (`O(g_ℓ⁴)`) could significantly alter the leading-order prediction.

    excerpt: |
      This module provides the formal calculation for the anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton, executing the protocol specified in XXP-013. We will calculate the two primary contributions to the anomaly: the universal self-echo and the mass-dependent environmental coupling. This is achieved by evaluating the one-loop "Pirouette Diagram" for a Coheron's self-interaction mediated by the Pressuron field. The final result is a numerical prediction that directly addresses the observed anomaly in the muon's g-2, serving as a primary test of the framework's predictive power.
  - module: MATH-013
    excerpt: |
      The total anomaly (a_ℓ) is the sum of the universal geometric term and a new correction from the background Γ field. In our QFT, this correction is represented by a one-loop diagram where a Coheron (the lepton, ℓ) emits and re-absorbs a virtual Pressuron (the quantum of the Γ field). This diagram represents the lepton "listening" to the noise of the Temporal Forge and adjusting its rhythm in response.

        L_interaction = g_ℓ Γ ψ̄_ℓ ψ_ℓ
      justification: |
        The core new interaction term is a scalar field (Γ, the Pressuron) coupling to a fermion bilinear (ψ̄_ℓ ψ_ℓ). This is mathematically identical to a standard Yukawa interaction. This allows for the use of standard, well-understood tools for calculating loop-level corrections and ensures the interaction is renormalizable in 4D.
