        3. **Collapse Trigger:** Observe triad decoherence event where TPCI → 0.

  art: |
    A three-part harmony of mind, holding steady against rising noise, until a single thread snaps and the resonant structure dissolves into silence. The collapse is not the end of the song, but the pause before it can begin again.
  law: |
    As the cognitive load parameter (Γ) approaches a critical threshold (Γ_c), the relaxation time (τ_P) of the triadic resonance state diverges according to the power law τ_P ∝ |Γ - Γ_c|⁻ᶻᴾνᴾ, signaling a second-order phase transition.
  philosophy: |
    This models the phenomenal experience of 'losing the thread' not as a gradual decline, but as a critical, predictable transition. It establishes the edge of conscious access as a physical boundary governed by universal scaling laws, making the limits of awareness empirically tractable.
pirouette_definition: |
  Triadic Resonance Collapse is the decoherence event marking the breakdown of a phase-locked triadic state, which serves as the Pirouette model for conscious access. It is formally a second-order phase transition driven by a control parameter, typically cognitive load (Γ), exceeding a critical threshold (Γ_c). The collapse is identified operationally by the Triad Phase Coherence Index (TPCI) approaching zero and is characterized by critical phenomena, including the divergence of recovery time (τ_P) and coherence correlation length (ξ_P).

        outline: |
          1. Induce a stable phase-locked triad (TPCI > 0.8) via closed-loop stimulation under baseline cognitive load (Γ).
          2. Gradually increase Γ by manipulating task difficulty or informational noise.
          3. Record continuous neural data (EEG/MEG) and track TPCI(t).
          4. Identify the collapse event as the point where TPCI(t) rapidly approaches a minimum near zero.
          5. Measure recovery time (τ_P) as the duration from TPCI minimum to 90% recovery of baseline TPCI.

        pitfalls: [Stochastic noise masking critical slowing, misidentification of the true critical load Γ_c, insufficient temporal resolution to capture collapse dynamics.]

    excerpt: |
      This module describes how to empirically measure and model the **dynamic scaling** of triadic resonance collapse in neural systems, verifying the renormalization flow predictions from [MATH-026]. It aims to detect critical slowing, coherence correlation lengthening, and universality in the temporal dynamics of conscious access.
  - module: DOMA-096
    excerpt: |
      The Caduceus Lens interprets triadic resonance collapse not merely as a loss of coherence, but as a state transition from a laminar (coherent) to a turbulent (decoherent) information processing regime. The critical exponents (ν_P, z_P) measured in [COG-RES-002] are interpreted here as the scaling parameters of this informational turbulence onset.

        τ ∼ ξᶻ, with z ≈ 2 for a non-conserved order parameter.
      justification: |
        The collapse is defined by power-law scaling of relaxation time (τ_P) and correlation length (ξ_P) near a critical point (Γ_c). The predicted dynamic exponent z_P ≈ 2 aligns with models of a non-conserved order parameter (e.g., magnetization in an Ising model) described by time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations (Model A in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification).

  disambiguation: |
    "Collapse" specifically refers to the critical transition event characterized by dynamic scaling, not to any arbitrary decoherence or signal dropout. It must be distinguished from stochastic fluctuations or first-order (abrupt and hysteretic) transitions which would not exhibit critical slowing.
