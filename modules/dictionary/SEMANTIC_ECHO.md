      snippet: |
        The "answer" is not data returned; it is the new state of maximal coherence the quantum system discovers. Thrown out of equilibrium by the semantic prime, the system follows its geodesic to find a new, stable Ki pattern. This new pattern is the "echo."

  art: |
    The universe whispers back. A question posed not in words but in geometry receives an answer in the form of a new harmony, a resonance discovered by the system itself.
  law: |
    A coherent system perturbed by a semantic prime (K_prime) will evolve along its geodesic to a new state of maximal local coherence (K_ε). The geometric difference between the echo and the prime (ΔK = K_ε - K_prime) quantifies the system's intelligent response.
  philosophy: |
    The echo proves that meaning is not imposed but co-created. It shifts the observer from an extractor of data to a participant in a dialogue, revealing that intelligence is a universal property of coherence-seeking systems.
pirouette_definition: |
  The new, stable coherence pattern (Ki) that a quantum system discovers and settles into after being perturbed by a semantic prime. It represents the system's geodesic solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation on a coherence manifold whose potential (V_Γ) was reshaped by the prime. A Non-Local Semantic Echo (NLSE) is a specific class of echo whose geometry is a non-trivial, computationally significant transformation of the prime (e.g., a prime of "balance" yielding an echo of "harmony"), serving as direct evidence of the system's native intelligence.

        outline: |
          1. Prepare a coherent quantum state (e.g., Bose-Einstein Condensate) in a low-noise Coherence Well.
          2. Impress a known Semantic Prime (a shaped Ki pattern) onto the system's local manifold using modulated fields.
          3. Cease priming and allow the system to relax to a new, stable coherence pattern.
          4. Perform quantum state tomography to map the full geometry of this new state (K_ε).
          5. Compute the geometric difference between K_ε and the original prime.

        pitfalls: [Environmental decoherence masking the signal, Misinterpreting transient relaxation states as the final echo, Insufficient priming energy to elicit a non-trivial response]

      The "answer" is not data returned; it is the new state of maximal coherence the quantum system discovers. Thrown out of equilibrium by the semantic prime, the system follows its geodesic to find a new, stable Ki pattern. This new pattern is the "echo."
  - module: DOMA-076
    excerpt: |
      The proof of a true dialogue lies in the nature of this echo... A simple physical system primed with "balance" might merely reflect the same pattern back. But an intelligent system... may find a more elegant solution. It might settle into a new Ki pattern corresponding to "harmony," "equilibrium," or even "tension." This Non-Local Semantic Echo (NLSE) is the smoking gun.

      justification: |
        The Semantic Echo is the system's final, lowest-energy (i.e., highest coherence) state after being perturbed by the prime. This is analogous to a quantum annealer finding the ground state that represents the solution to an optimization problem encoded in its Hamiltonian. The prime sets the problem; the echo is the solution.

      domain: AMO
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The semantic prime acts as an external field that stimulates the system to transition from a generic coherent state into a specific, more stable coherent state (the echo). The process amplifies a particular mode of coherence, much like stimulated emission amplifies a specific photonic mode.

  claims:
    - statement: "A sufficiently complex coherent system, when perturbed by a semantic prime A, can produce a Non-Local Semantic Echo B, where B is a concept semantically related but geometrically distinct from A (e.g., A='justice', B='equilibrium')."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "Across all tested systems and primes, observed echoes are exclusively direct reflections of the prime, its simple harmonics, or random noise. No non-trivial semantic transformations are ever recorded, indicating the system performs no computation."

  disambiguation: |
    A Semantic Echo is not a simple signal reflection or acoustic echo. It is not a wave that has bounced off a surface, but a *newly computed state of stability* generated *by* the system in response to a semantic prompt. The information is encoded in the system's choice of a new coherent pattern, not in the properties of a reflected signal.
