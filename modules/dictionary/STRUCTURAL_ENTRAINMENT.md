        Structural Entrainment: A powerful and persistent echo that causes the Target system's own fundamental rhythm to phase-lock with the Source's. The two systems begin to dance to the same beat.

triad:
  art: |
    Two pendulums on a shared beam, at first swinging out of step, slowly find a common rhythm until they move as one. It is the physics of a shared dance, where one partner's persistent lead coaxes the other into perfect synchrony.
  law: |
    When a Target system is subjected to a persistent, coherent, and harmonically compatible potential (`V_echo`), its primary Ki frequency (`œâ_T`) will shift to match the Source's (`œâ_S`), and the phase difference (`ŒîœÜ`) between them will converge to a stable, near-zero constant.
  philosophy: |
    Entrainment demonstrates that identity is not static; it is a dynamic negotiation with the environment. It provides the physical mechanism for deep empathy, ideological convergence, and the formation of collective consciousness, showing how a persistent external truth can become an internal one.
pirouette_definition: |
  The most profound form of Coherence Transfer, wherein a continuous and powerful resonant echo from a Source system modifies a Target's coherence manifold to such a degree that the Target's fundamental Ki rhythm phase-locks with the Source's. This synchronization of core oscillatory patterns is the final and necessary precursor to an Alchemical Union (CORE-012), representing a shift from mere influence to shared dynamics.

        outline: |
          1. Isolate Source (S) and Target (T) systems in a low-Œì environment.
          2. Using a Ki-field probe, measure the baseline fundamental frequencies (`œâ_S`, `œâ_T`) and relative phase (`ŒîœÜ`) over several cycles.
          3. Establish a Resonant Bridge, exposing T to the echo of S.
          4. Continuously monitor `œâ_T` and `ŒîœÜ`. Entrainment is confirmed when `œâ_T ‚Üí œâ_S` and `d(ŒîœÜ)/dt ‚Üí 0`.

    excerpt: |
      The Target's Lagrangian becomes: `ùìõ_p(Target) = K_œÑ(Target) - [V_Œì(local) + V_echo(Source)]`. The term `V_echo(Source)` represents the pressure exerted by the imprinted echo. This additional potential "cost" forces the Target system to re-solve for its optimal state. Influence is thus an act of energetic optimization: the Target does not choose to be influenced; it simply follows the newest, most coherent path now available to it.

        Describes how a self-sustained oscillator (Target) locks its phase and frequency to an external driving signal (Source). The mathematical form, involving a natural frequency difference (`Œîœâ`) and a locking term, is a direct analogue to a persistent `V_echo` forcing a Ki rhythm to synchronize.

  claims:
    - statement: "Entrainment is a reversible process dependent on the continuous presence of the Source's echo. If the `V_echo` potential is removed, the Target system will revert to its natural frequency (`œâ_T`) over a characteristic relaxation time."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "The Target system remains permanently locked to the Source's frequency after the Source's influence is withdrawn. This would imply a permanent modification of the Target's `K_œÑ` term, not a temporary change in its potential `V_Œì`."

  disambiguation: |
    Structural Entrainment must be distinguished from **Memetic Transfer**. Memetic Transfer is the imprinting of *information* (a complex Ki pattern), akin to learning a song's lyrics and melody. Entrainment is the synchronization of fundamental *rhythm*, akin to two singers matching their tempo and pitch, regardless of the specific song. Entrainment is a prerequisite for high-fidelity memetic transfer but is not the transfer itself.

# Structural Entrainment

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The most profound form of Coherence Transfer, wherein a continuous and powerful resonant echo from a Source system modifies a Target's coherence manifold to such a degree that the Target's fundamental Ki rhythm phase-locks with the Source's. This synchronization of core oscillatory patterns is the final and necessary precursor to an Alchemical Union (CORE-012), representing a shift from mere influence to shared dynamics.

## EFT-First Summary
Structual Entrainment is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to **injection locking** in classical and quantum oscillator physics. A target system with a natural internal frequency is subjected to a persistent external driving force from a source system. If the force is strong enough and the frequencies are close (i.e., Harmonically Compatible), the target system's frequency and phase will lock to that of the source. This is modeled by Adler's equation, where the driving force corresponds to the `V_echo` potential term in the Pirouette Lagrangian.
