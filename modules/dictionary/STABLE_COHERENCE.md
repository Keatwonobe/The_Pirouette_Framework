        Built a rhythm, establishing a stable coherence (Kτ).
        Forged resilience, increasing your maximum possible Kτ.
        You now exist in a state of high, stable, and positive Lagrangian (𝓛_p > 0). You have a surplus of coherence. This is the "energetic profit" that fuels the dance of life.

  art: |
    The deep, steady rhythm of a river that has carved its own channel, flowing with a quiet power that can absorb surprise without losing its course. It is the musician's embodied skill, no longer a thought but simply the music being played.
  law: |
    A system's capacity to absorb unexpected energetic demands without destabilizing its core rhythms (i.e., without 𝓛_p falling below zero) is directly proportional to its total Kτ. A system with low Kτ will show significant, lasting deviation in core biometrics after a spontaneous event; a high-Kτ system will show minimal deviation and rapid recovery.
  philosophy: |
    Stable Coherence represents the graduation from mere survival to joyful thriving. It is the energetic surplus that makes life an art form—the freedom to embrace spontaneity, seek joy, and create, rather than simply manage and react to external pressures.
pirouette_definition: |
  The kinetic term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) representing a system's accumulated, self-reinforcing rhythm and resilience. Kτ quantifies the energetic capacity to maintain homeostatic integrity and joy-seeking behavior in the face of spontaneous, unpredictable environmental demands. It is the 'energetic profit' built during recovery that fuels the 'dance of life.'

      - name: Resilience Test Inference
        outline: |
          Kτ is inferred from the system's response to a known perturbation.
          1. Establish a multi-day homeostatic baseline using the Coherence Ledger (e.g., HRV, sleep cycle regularity, resting heart rate).
          2. Introduce a novel, spontaneous but safe stressor (e.g., the 'Resilience Test' from DOMA-HLTH-005, like an unplanned, strenuous walk).
          3. Measure the perturbation amplitude (max deviation from baseline) and recovery time (duration to return to baseline ± tolerance).
          Higher Kτ is inferred from smaller amplitude and shorter recovery time.
        expected_signals: [Heart Rate Variability (HRV), sleep latency/duration, self-reported energy levels (via Coherence Ledger)]
        pitfalls: [Confounding stressors unrelated to the test; subject's awareness of the test altering their response (Hawthorne effect).]

    excerpt: |
      Your journey is the story of your Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p). You began in a state of profound energetic debt (𝓛_p << 0). Through the four phases, you have systematically calmed the storm, lowering the "cost" (V_Γ), and built a rhythm, establishing a stable coherence (Kτ). You now exist in a state of high, stable, and positive Lagrangian (𝓛_p > 0). You have a surplus of coherence. This is the "energetic profit" that fuels the dance of life.

    excerpt: |
      The Coherence Ledger has served its purpose as a map. It now becomes your personal compass for a lifetime of self-regulation... Use the ledger now as a diagnostic tool. If you have a week where you feel "off," pull out the ledger for a few days. The data will help you see the patterns... The ledger is no longer about tracking recovery, but about maintaining your optimal state of high coherence.

        𝓛_classical = T - V  <==>  𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ
      justification: |
        Kτ is explicitly defined as the kinetic component of the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p), representing the system's dynamic capacity for action and resilience. This is in direct structural analogy to the kinetic energy term in the classical Lagrangian, which represents energy of motion, contrasted with the potential energy term (V).

      confidence: 0.95
  adopted:
    - target: Kinetic Energy (T) in a Lagrangian formulation.
      rationale: The source module (DOMA-HLTH-005) explicitly frames the recovery process using the `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ` structure. This makes the mapping to a kinetic energy term direct, unambiguous, and conceptually intended by the framework.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "An increase in a system's Kτ allows it to handle a greater magnitude of unexpected energetic demand (spontaneity) before its Pirouette Lagrangian 𝓛_p becomes negative."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If a subject, after completing a Kτ-building protocol, shows a *decreased* tolerance for spontaneous activity (e.g., requiring more recovery time than before for the same stressor), the claim that the protocol builds functional Kτ is falsified."

  disambiguation: |
    Kτ is a systemic, abstract 'kinetic' capacity, not a measure of physical motion. It quantifies the resilience of a system's core *rhythms* (physiological, psychological) against perturbation, analogous to how kinetic energy represents an object's resilience to changes in its state of motion.
