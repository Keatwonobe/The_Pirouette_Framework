    The Geodesic Walk is the path of least resistance and greatest grace. It is the gentle, steady work of turning a single step into a journey, carving a riverbed of health through the landscape of one's own being.
  law: |
    The correct pace for a Geodesic Walk is maintained when the subject can hold a light conversation without becoming breathless ("The Conversation Test"). Progression is limited to adding one minute of duration every other day, contingent on the absence of pain or excessive strain.
  philosophy: |
    The Geodesic Walk reframes recovery not as a battle against the body, but as the art of finding the most efficient, natural path forward. By consistently choosing the path of greatest ease, one builds momentum and carves a new, self-sustaining rhythm of health, making recovery an emergent property of gentle persistence rather than brute force.
pirouette_definition: |
  The core practice of post-operative Phase II recovery, consisting of a daily, gradually lengthening walk along a path of least resistance. The walk's pace is governed by the "Conversation Test" to ensure it remains aerobic and non-strenuous. Its purpose is to re-establish a stable rhythm (Ki) and build Temporal Coherence (Kτ), thereby carving a "Wound Channel" of healthy momentum.

        outline: |
          During the walk, a helper (Pacesetter) initiates and maintains a light conversation with the patient. The patient's ability to respond in full sentences without gasping or significant pauses is monitored. If speech becomes strained (P_conv=0), the pace is too high and must be reduced until conversation is comfortable again (P_conv=1).
        expected_signals: [Steady, unstrained vocalization, Stable respiratory rate]
        pitfalls: [Patient pushing through breathlessness to avoid seeming weak, Helper not engaging in enough conversation to get a valid reading]

    excerpt: |
      The "geodesic" is the path of least resistance and greatest grace. Walking is the geodesic of your recovery. The Practice: Start Slow. Gradual Progression. Add just one minute every other day, as long as it feels good. The right pace is one where you can comfortably hold a conversation without becoming breathless. This is your body's natural speedometer.

    excerpt: |
      Goal 2: Carve the Channel. With every repetition of this new rhythm, you are carving a "groove" or a "riverbed" in the landscape of your own being. This is your Wound Channel. The deeper we carve this channel through gentle practice, the easier it will be for your body to follow this healthy path automatically. The Guiding Rule: Consistency over Intensity.

      justification: |
        The Geodesic Walk operationalizes the principle of least action for biological recovery. Rather than maximizing effort (intensity), the protocol minimizes resistance and strain (the 'cost' function) to find the most efficient path for building momentum (Temporal Coherence). The 'Conversation Test' acts as a real-time sensor for this path of least physiological action.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'Geodesic' is used metaphorically to denote the path of *least physiological resistance* and greatest efficiency for a given process, not a literal shortest path in a geometric space. It is an operationalization of the Lagrangian principle of minimizing cost to maximize coherent action.

# Geodesic Walk

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The core practice of post-operative Phase II recovery, consisting of a daily, gradually lengthening walk along a path of least resistance. The walk's pace is governed by the "Conversation Test" to ensure it remains aerobic and non-strenuous. Its purpose is to re-establish a stable rhythm (Ki) and build Temporal Coherence (Kτ), thereby carving a "Wound Channel" of healthy momentum.

## EFT-First Summary
The Geodesic Walk is a conceptual mapping of the principle of least action from classical mechanics onto the domain of biological recovery. Instead of maximizing a kinetic term (e.g., intensity, speed), the protocol seeks to minimize a potential or cost term (e.g., physiological strain, breathlessness, pain). The "Conversation Test" serves as the primary sensor for this cost term. By consistently finding the path of least action, the system (the patient) builds coherent momentum (Temporal Coherence) most efficiently, leading to a positive Lagrangian and a self-sustaining recovery trajectory.
