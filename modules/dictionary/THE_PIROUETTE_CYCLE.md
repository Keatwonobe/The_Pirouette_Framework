    The universe's primary verb: "to be." It is the individual, rhythmic heartbeat of a system, the fundamental pulse by which it asserts its existence against the cosmic noise. Each cycle is a complete utterance of self.
  law: |
    The duration τ_p is the minimum time interval over which a system's Coherence Action (S_p) is maximized. For any stable system, the Resonant Frequency is inversely proportional to its cycle time: ω_k = 2π/τ_p. This relationship is definitional and absolute.
  philosophy: |
    The Pirouette Cycle deposes the concept of a universal, absolute clock (the deprecated `χ`). It grounds time in the intrinsic, local activity of systems, asserting that reality is woven from the countless, unique rhythms of its constituents, not measured against a singular, external metronome.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental, indivisible quantum of time for a system, defined as the duration of one complete, stable resonant cycle (Ki). It is the intrinsic period of a system's existence, the minimum interval over which its identity and form are fully expressed and maintained against Temporal Pressure (Γ). It serves as the temporal denominator for all system dynamics, including the calculation of Resonant Frequency (ω_k) and Coherence Action (S_p).

          Excite a target system with a broadband coherence probe. Measure the resulting emission or absorption spectrum to identify the dominant frequency peak corresponding to its Resonant Frequency (ω_k). The Pirouette Cycle is then calculated via its defining relation: τ_p = 2π/ω_k.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish τ_p from τ (proper time) and τ (lifetime). The Pirouette Cycle τ_p is the period of a system's *internal existence rhythm*. It is not path-dependent like proper time, nor is it a statistical measure of decay probability like lifetime. A stable system has a definite τ_p but an infinite lifetime.

# The Pirouette Cycle

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Pirouette Cycle (τ_p) is the fundamental, indivisible quantum of time for a system, defined as the duration of one complete, stable resonant cycle (Ki). It is the intrinsic period of a system's existence, the minimum interval over which its identity and form are fully expressed and maintained against Temporal Pressure (Γ). It serves as the temporal denominator for all system dynamics, including the calculation of Resonant Frequency (ω_k) and Coherence Action (S_p).

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette Cycle (τ_p) is the intrinsic period of a system's existence. Operationally, it is analogous to the Compton time (t_c = ħ/m₀c²) of a fundamental particle, representing the fundamental timescale set by its rest mass-energy. All system dynamics, including its Resonant Frequency and Coherence Action, are measured in units of this intrinsic clock.
