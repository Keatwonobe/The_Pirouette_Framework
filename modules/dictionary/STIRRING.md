      snippet: |
        The act of stirring is a temporary and controlled modification of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`). The Weaver introduces a time-dependent "stirring potential," `Γ_stir(t)`, which is added to the system's normal potential energy of temporal pressure.

    A system at rest is a story that has ended; to begin a new chapter, one must be willing to disturb the ink. We trouble the waters so the river may find a better path to the sea.
  law: |
    A system trapped in a local coherence minimum can be induced to find a more optimal state by applying a resonant, time-dependent potential `Γ_stir(t)` with sufficient amplitude and duration to overcome its inertial Wound Channel, but short enough to preserve its coherent memory.
  philosophy: |
    Stirring is the moment a Weaver picks up the crucible, knowing that to forge something new, one must first be willing to melt down the old. It is the necessary act of believing that a system's potential is always greater than its present state.
pirouette_definition: |
  Stirring is the deliberate injection of controlled, resonant turbulence into a system to disrupt a suboptimal stable state (a local coherence minimum). This process, modeled as a temporary, time-dependent potential `Γ_stir(t)` added to the Pirouette Lagrangian, provides the necessary activation energy for the system to escape its rut, explore the state space, and re-cohere into a new, more complex, and higher-coherence resonant pattern.

        outline: |
          1. Characterize the system's initial Ki pattern and coherence flow metrics to establish a baseline local minimum.
          2. Design a `Γ_stir(t)` protocol by estimating the system's primary resonant harmonic (ω_stir) and inertial depth (minimum A_stir).
          3. Apply the potential for a set duration (Δt).
          4. Track coherence metrics in real-time to observe the phases of Destabilization, Exploration, and Re-Coherence.
          5. Compare the final stable Ki pattern's complexity and coherence to the initial baseline to quantify the efficacy of the stir.

    excerpt: |
      A system requires this intervention when its flow of coherence...has become pathological. It has found a stable Ki pattern, but it is a pattern of low complexity and limited potential. The system's Wound Channel (`CORE-011`) has become a deep, inescapable groove. ... The system has settled into a shallow well on the coherence manifold. It is stable, but it is blind to the deeper, more profound states of coherence that may lie just over the next hill.

    excerpt: |
      The intensity and character of the stir is the difference between catalysis and catastrophe. ... A constant pressure is a blunt instrument. A rhythmic pulse, tuned to a natural harmonic of the target system, creates **resonant turbulence**, allowing for a maximally efficient transfer of energy. It uses a system's own nature to coax it out of its rut with minimal force.

        Stirring provides activation energy (analogous to thermal energy controlled by temperature T) that allows a system to overcome potential barriers and escape local minima in its state space. The amplitude of the stir (A_stir) directly controls the probability of such transitions, mirroring the role of temperature in simulated annealing algorithms.

# Stirring

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Stirring is the deliberate injection of controlled, resonant turbulence into a system to disrupt a suboptimal stable state (a local coherence minimum). This process, modeled as a temporary, time-dependent potential `Γ_stir(t)` added to the Pirouette Lagrangian, provides the necessary activation energy for the system to escape its rut, explore the state space, and re-cohere into a new, more complex, and higher-coherence resonant pattern.

## EFT-First Summary
Stirring is analogous to a controlled annealing process in statistical mechanics. A time-dependent potential, `Γ_stir(t)`, acts like a tunable 'effective temperature,' injecting energy to allow a system to overcome potential barriers and escape local minima in its coherence manifold. Unlike random thermal noise, this potential can be applied resonantly, maximizing the efficiency of the state transition, a feature akin to targeted mode excitation in complex systems. See [Optimization by Simulated Annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.220.4598.671).
