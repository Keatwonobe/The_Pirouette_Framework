    A clock's stability, the trust in a society, a cell's homeostasis‚Äîthese are not the thing itself, but the local dialect through which the universal grammar of Coherence is spoken. A proxy is the shadow on the cave wall, a measurable echo of an ideal form.
  law: |
    Every measurement of `KœÑ` or `VŒì` must be preceded by an explicit declaration of the observable, domain-specific proxy variables being used. The quality of a prediction is formally limited by the verified correlation between the chosen proxies and the universal terms they represent.
  philosophy: |
    Proxy variables bridge the abstract, universal mathematics of the Pirouette Lagrangian to the tangible, messy reality of a specific system. They are the necessary act of translation that makes the framework empirically solvable, grounding its predictive power in verifiable data.
pirouette_definition: |
  A set of observable, domain-specific measurements selected to serve as empirical representatives for the universal Lagrangian terms of Coherence (`KœÑ`) and Pressure (`VŒì`). The selection and calibration of proxy variables is the foundational act of the Weaver's Lens protocol (DOMA-069), translating the abstract dynamics of a system into a verifiable, quantitative time-series suitable for solving its geodesic.
operational_definition:
  units: Domain-specific (e.g., Hz, K, currency volatility index, ticket/hour). Must be normalized into the dimensionless units of `KœÑ` and `VŒì` via the specified calibration protocol.

      - name: The Weaver's Lens Calibration Ritual
        outline: |
          1.  **Define the Lens:** Explicitly declare the proxy variables for `KœÑ` and `VŒì`.
          2.  **Vow of Silence (Zeroing):** Isolate the instrument to measure its baseline internal noise.
          3.  **Harmonious Duet (Cross-Calibration):** Compare readings against a trusted standard to ensure consensus reality.
          4.  **Notary's Seal (Commit):** Cryptographically sign and commit the calibration state and all subsequent `{KœÑ, VŒì}` measurements to an immutable ledger.

    excerpt: |
      Measurement is not about detecting a pre-defined field; it is an act of translation, of identifying the observable, domain-specific proxies for the universal terms of the Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = KœÑ - VŒì`). To measure any system is to first define its lens.
  - module: DOMA-069
    excerpt: |
      An instrument that lies is worse than no instrument at all. A measurement without provenance is an opinion. This ritual ensures that every observation is rigorous, transparent, and reproducible... The Weaver must explicitly declare the proxy variables chosen for `KœÑ` and `VŒì` for the system under analysis. This declaration is the "calibration certificate" and the foundational act of honest observation.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Proxy variables for Coherence (`KœÑ`) function as order parameters in condensed matter physics. They are macroscopic observables (e.g., magnetization) whose non-zero value indicates an ordered, coherent phase. The choice of proxy is similarly domain-specific.

    - target: Effective Temperature (T_eff)
      domain: EFT
      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        Proxy variables for Pressure (`VŒì`) often map to measures of environmental noise or stochastic forcing. In many physical systems, this is quantified as an effective temperature, which determines the magnitude of fluctuations via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

  claims:
    - statement: "A well-chosen pair of proxy variables will produce `(KœÑ, VŒì)` tuples that, when integrated via the Pirouette Lagrangian, predict the system's near-future trajectory with a mean squared error significantly below that of a naive (e.g., random walk) model."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "For a given system, if no set of physically plausible proxy variables can be found that yields predictions better than a random walk, then either the framework is inapplicable to that system or the core principle of correspondence is false."

  disambiguation: |
    The term is used analogously to "proxy variable" in statistics: a measurable variable used in place of one that cannot be directly measured. Crucially, a proxy variable is *not* the universal term itself (`KœÑ` or `VŒì`), but a carefully chosen and calibrated representative. The validity of any analysis rests on the strength of this representation.
