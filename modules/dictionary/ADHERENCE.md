  art: |
    A choir achieves harmony not when the conductor forces each throat, but when they tune the room itself—dimming the lights, providing water, and setting a clear tone. Adherence is the measure of that self-tuned resonance.
  law: |
    Adherence is the order parameter governing system alignment; the rate at which a system transitions between states is exponentially modulated by the usable coherence (Kτ) gained, subject to strict constraints on observation cost (V_obs) and negative externalities (D).
  philosophy: |
    Adherence reframes coherence from a property to be coercively maximized into a measurable state of consentful alignment. It provides a physical and ethical basis for guiding systems toward collective intelligence without manipulation, making the process of achieving harmony transparent, voluntary, and auditable.
pirouette_definition: |
  Adherence (Ta) is a dimensionless order parameter that measures the degree of phase coherence within a system or agent manifold. It is calculated as the squared magnitude of the average phase vector over the manifold's volume. Within the Pirouette Lagrangian, Ta sets the rate at which systems align or decohere under perturbation, and is the primary quantity optimized by the Coherent Adherence Protocol (CAP v2) under strict consent and transparency constraints.

        outline: |
          1. Identify the system or agent manifold (V).
          2. For each element, define and measure its phase angle (θ) relative to a common reference.
          3. Represent each element as a unit vector, e^(iθ), on the complex plane.
          4. Compute the vector average of all elements.
          5. Calculate the squared magnitude of this average vector to obtain Ta.
        expected_signals: [A scalar value Ta(t) ∈ [0, 1], often as a time series.]
        pitfalls: [Defining a meaningful phase θ for complex agents; measurement back-action (V_obs) altering the system's true Ta; sampling errors in large manifolds.]

      **Adherence (Ta):** empirical coherence order parameter
      \[
      T_a \;=\;\Bigl|\frac{1}{V}\int_V e^{i\theta(x^\mu)}\,dV\Bigr|^2,
      \]
      i.e., squared phase-mean magnitude over the field/agent manifold. Ta sets the *rate* systems align or decohere under perturbation.
  - module: DYNA-005_coherent_adherence_protocol
    excerpt: |
      CAP v2 *does*: shape *contexts* (measurement geometry, rhythms, interfaces, incentives) to elevate Ta where *participants have agreed*, aiming for better sensing, learning, or collaboration. It *refuses*: hidden persuasion; coercive asymmetries; unlogged back-channels; any influence that raises \(V_{\text{obs}}\) on people without consent.

    excerpt: |
      The new conductor brought water, printed the score, dimmed the harsh lights, and *asked* for one note at a time. The room tuned itself. The song was almost as perfect—and everyone stayed to sing an encore. **CAP v2** is the second conductor: it changes the *room*, not the throat.

    - target: Kuramoto Order Parameter (r)

      mapping_kind: mathematical
      equation_hint: |
        Ta = r^2, where r = |(1/N) * Σ[j=1 to N] exp(iθ_j)|
      justification: |
        The definition of Ta is mathematically identical to the square of the Kuramoto order parameter, a standard measure of synchrony in coupled oscillator systems. Both quantify the macroscopic degree of phase alignment in a population of interacting elements. This provides a direct bridge to the extensive literature on synchronization phenomena.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Interventions designed via the Coherent Adherence Protocol (CAP v2) can increase system Adherence (ΔTa > 0) without increasing the observer cost (V_obs) or total power input."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "An experiment where all tested CAP v2 interventions fail to increase Ta, or can only do so by proportionally increasing V_obs or power/effort, would refute the 'coherence-not-force' claim."
      status: proposed
      links: [DYNA-005]
    - statement: "For human systems, Adherence gains are only sustainable when achieved under the ethical constraints of CAP v2 (consent, transparency, symmetry)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A long-term study showing a coercive, non-consensual protocol consistently maintaining high Ta without generating runaway Dark Residue (e.g., user abandonment, burnout) would falsify this claim."
      status: proposed
      links: [DYNA-005]
naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol 'T' is overwhelmingly used for Temperature in physics. The subscript 'a' is crucial for disambiguation.]
  disambiguation: |
    Ta is not a thermal property. It is a structural order parameter quantifying phase coherence, analogous to magnetization in the XY model or the squared Kuramoto parameter. Think "alignment," not "agitation."
