        This compass is an engine for navigating the coherence manifold not with a perfect map, but with a reliable needle that always points toward the wisest timely action, trading the paralysis of perfect analysis for the grace of the next right step.

  art: |
    Wisdom is not possessing a perfect map of the river, which is always obsolete. It is the mastery of a reliable compass that, in the midst of the storm, always points the way toward coherence.
  law: |
    The Geodesic Compass formalizes the trade-off between optimality and speed. It provides a set of heuristics that guarantee a decision within a pre-calculated Coherence Bound of the optimal path, in exchange for a significant reduction in computational latency.
  philosophy: |
    To act effectively under pressure requires sacrificing perfect knowledge for 'good enough' wisdom. The Compass makes this trade principled, ensuring that the urgent need for action does not sever the system from its long-term path of maximal coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  A meta-protocol for distilling the computationally intensive Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) into a set of lightweight, reliable heuristics known as Geodesic Templates. This collection of templates serves as a "compass" for rapid, "good enough" navigation of the coherence manifold, enabling effective real-time decision-making under high Temporal Pressure (Œì) by providing simple, actionable rules with pre-quantified risk (Coherence Bounds).

        outline: |
          1. In a simulated environment, identify a system state that matches a Geodesic Template's trigger condition.
          2. Calculate the optimal action and its resulting coherence trajectory using a full, computationally expensive Pirouette Lagrangian analysis.
          3. Apply the Geodesic Template's simplified prescribed action and measure its resulting coherence trajectory.
          4. The difference in final coherence between the optimal (Step 2) and heuristic (Step 3) outcomes is measured. This value must be within the template's specified Coherence Bound.

        pitfalls: [Poorly calibrated Coherence Bound leading to catastrophic losses, Misapplication of a template outside its valid trigger conditions]

    excerpt: |
      The perfect map of the ocean is useless to a sailor caught in a storm. The perfect path, calculated too late, is the path to ruin. The Pirouette Lagrangian provides the "perfect map"‚Äîa mathematical description of a system's geodesic of maximal coherence. To calculate this path with complete fidelity requires immense resources, a luxury unavailable in the turbulent flow of real-time events.
  - module: DOMA-081
    excerpt: |
      The Geodesic Compass does not replace the Pirouette Lagrangian; it serves it by making it practical. Each template is a qualitative, pre-computed approximation of the Euler-Lagrange equations for a common family of boundary conditions. To use the Compass is to perform a Lagrangian analysis by feel, trading numerical precision for actionable speed and embodied wisdom.

        Just as an EFT provides a simplified, tractable model by integrating out high-energy degrees of freedom, the Geodesic Compass distills the full Pirouette Lagrangian into low-complexity heuristics (templates). These templates are analogous to effective operators (O·µ¢), valid under specific conditions (e.g., high temporal pressure), with the Coherence Bound quantifying the error from truncating the full theory.

        The Compass provides a set of heuristic functions that estimate the "cost" or "benefit" (in terms of coherence) of an action without performing a full search of the state space. This mirrors how a heuristic `h(n)` guides algorithms like A*, trading guaranteed optimality for drastically improved performance in finding a "good enough" path.

  disambiguation: |
    The Geodesic Compass is not a physical instrument for spatial navigation. It is a formal set of decision-making rules for navigating the abstract state space of a system ("coherence manifold"). It points toward maximal coherence, not magnetic north. It is an approximation tool, distinct from a 'map' (the full Pirouette Lagrangian) which describes the entire territory in detail.

# Geodesic Compass

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A meta-protocol for distilling the computationally intensive Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) into a set of lightweight, reliable heuristics known as Geodesic Templates. This collection of templates serves as a "compass" for rapid, "good enough" navigation of the coherence manifold, enabling effective real-time decision-making under high Temporal Pressure (Œì) by providing simple, actionable rules with pre-quantified risk (Coherence Bounds).

## EFT-First Summary
The Geodesic Compass serves as an operational heuristic framework, analogous to a set of pre-calculated rules of thumb or the use of a heuristic function in A* search algorithms. Conceptually, it mirrors the role of an Effective Field Theory (EFT), where the complex, universal dynamics of the Pirouette Lagrangian are distilled into a simpler set of effective rules ("templates") that are computationally tractable and valid under specific, constrained conditions, such as high temporal pressure.
