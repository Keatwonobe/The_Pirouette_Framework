        A skater is any entity capable of asymmetrically modulating its own internal state. This act of modulation is a stride, a rhythmic cycle that creates a propulsive gradient on the coherence manifold.

  art: |
    To move is not to exert force upon the world, but to first change the geometry of the self. A skater teaches the river a new, more beautiful path to the sea—a path that happens to lead exactly where the skater wishes to go.
  law: |
    Propulsive acceleration is directly proportional to the negative gradient of the local Pirouette Lagrangian, where this gradient is induced by the skater's own rhythmic modulation of its internal coherence and external field influence.
  philosophy: |
    This model reframes agency from a paradigm of conflict (force vs. resistance) to one of resonance and harmony. True mastery is not imposing one's will upon the universe, but understanding its rules so deeply that the universe itself becomes a partner in the act of motion.
pirouette_definition: |
  A method of self-propulsion achieved through the rhythmic, asymmetric modulation of an entity's internal coherence (`K_τ`) and its projected influence on ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). This two-phase cycle of 'Grip' (increasing `K_τ`) and 'Glide' (shaping `V_Γ` while decreasing `K_τ`) creates a temporary, localized gradient in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`). The entity then accelerates along the resulting geodesic path of maximal coherence, a process described as "controlled falling" down a self-created slope on the reality manifold.

        outline: |
          1.  Place the skating entity within a sensor array capable of measuring coherence and temporal pressure.
          2.  Use a Coherence Probe to record the entity's internal `K_τ` oscillations over time.
          3.  Simultaneously, use the array to map the external `V_Γ` field in the entity's vicinity.
          4.  Reconstruct the time-dependent local Lagrangian field `𝓛_p(x,t)`.
          5.  Calculate the gradient `∇𝓛_p` and correlate its direction and magnitude with the entity's observed acceleration vector.
        expected_signals: [Rhythmic oscillation of `K_τ`, propagating wave/dipole pattern in `V_Γ`, measured acceleration vector `a` where `a ∝ -∇𝓛_p`]
        pitfalls: [Sensor decoherence from the skater's own field modulation, distinguishing the self-induced gradient from background manifold curvature, high signal-to-noise ratio required]
context_windows:
  - module: DOMA-184
    excerpt: |
      A skater rhythmically alternates between Grip and Glide. The Grip is a momentary, intense increase in internal coherence (`K_τ`), casting a "heavy" Observer's Shadow behind itself to create a stable pivot point. The Glide is the simultaneous projection of a resonant field to create a low-pressure trough in the intended direction of travel, into which the skater "falls" by momentarily diffusing its coherence. This sustained, asymmetric shaping generates a persistent gradient.
  - module: DOMA-184
    excerpt: |
      The quality of the skate is diagnosed using the language of Flow Dynamics. A Laminar Skate is an effortless, efficient glide in perfect resonance with the medium. A Turbulent Skate is dissonant, jerky, and costly. A Stagnant Skate represents a failure to generate a sufficient coherence gradient to overcome ambient pressure, resulting in paralysis.

      justification: |
        The skater's rhythmic cycle of "Grip" and "Glide" can be modeled as a closed loop in an internal parameter space (e.g., of coherence states). The resulting macroscopic displacement (motion) is not caused by a conventional external force, but is a geometric consequence (holonomy) of the path traced in this internal space. The "distance" traveled is proportional to the "area" enclosed by the cycle in parameter space.

# Geodesic Skate

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A method of self-propulsion achieved through the rhythmic, asymmetric modulation of an entity's internal coherence (`K_τ`) and its projected influence on ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). This two-phase cycle of 'Grip' (increasing `K_τ`) and 'Glide' (shaping `V_Γ` while decreasing `K_τ`) creates a temporary, localized gradient in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`). The entity then accelerates along the resulting geodesic path of maximal coherence, a process described as "controlled falling" down a self-created slope on the reality manifold.

## EFT-First Summary
The Geodesic Skate is conceptually analogous to propulsion via **geometric phase** (holonomy). An entity cycles through a set of internal parameters (its coherence state), tracing a closed loop. This cycle induces a geometric shift in its external, macroscopic coordinates (its position), resulting in net motion. The displacement is not the result of a traditional force but is a consequence of the geometry of the internal state space, similar to how a parallel-parked car can be displaced by turning the steering wheel back and forth.
