    A quiet cove in the storm of creation, a place where a note can hold its pitch against the void's pull. It is a sanctuary carved into the primordial scar, offering stability to any pattern that learns its shape.
  law: |
    A Ki pattern's coherence lifetime (T_a) is maximized if and only if it occupies a Resonance Pocket. The geometry of the pockets, defined by the Genesis Knot, dictates the complete, discrete spectrum of stable elementary particles.
  philosophy: |
    The existence of distinct, stable "things" is not a given; it is a geometric necessity. Resonance Pockets transform the smooth potential of the Void into the granular reality of particles, making the universe knowable by making it countable.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable attractor basin within the coherence manifold defined by the 8-lobed geometry of the Genesis Knot. Each pocket corresponds to a region of maximal harmonic resonance where a Ki pattern can achieve a stable, long-lived existence. These pockets constitute the discrete, quantized set of allowed states for fundamental particles, with a particle's properties (like charge) being a direct function of the specific pocket it occupies.

        outline: |
          1. Configure a Temporal Forge (Œì-forge) to sweep through a parameter space of nascent Ki patterns.
          2. For each generated pattern, measure its coherence lifetime (T_a) before it dissolves.
          3. Plot T_a against the Ki pattern's geometric parameters.
          4. Resonance Pockets are identified as discrete, high-magnitude, narrow-width peaks in the resulting T_a spectrum.

    excerpt: |
      The properties we label as elementary charge (e.g., +2/3, -1/3) are not intrinsic substances a particle possesses. They are relational descriptions of which Resonance Pocket a quark's Ki pattern is currently occupying. Charge is a particle's geometric address within the Genesis Knot. Interaction rules, such as attraction and repulsion, are the geometric language of the manifold itself...

      justification: |
        Resonance Pockets are stable attractors into which Ki patterns "settle." This is conceptually analogous to a quantum field settling into a minimum of its potential energy, defining a stable vacuum state or particle mass. The pockets are the Pirouette framework's geometric, non-perturbative origin for the potential minima postulated in EFT.

  disambiguation: |
    A "Resonance Pocket" is not a physical container in 3D space. It is a stable region in the abstract, high-dimensional coherence manifold of the Genesis Knot. It should be distinguished from a "Wound Channel," which is the dynamic trajectory of a particle through spacetime; a pocket is a static feature of the background geometry that makes such stable trajectories possible.

# Resonance Pocket

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A stable attractor basin within the coherence manifold defined by the 8-lobed geometry of the Genesis Knot. Each pocket corresponds to a region of maximal harmonic resonance where a Ki pattern can achieve a stable, long-lived existence. These pockets constitute the discrete, quantized set of allowed states for fundamental particles, with a particle's properties (like charge) being a direct function of the specific pocket it occupies.

## EFT-First Summary
In Effective Field Theory (EFT), the stability of a particle is associated with a minimum in the potential energy V(œÜ) of its corresponding quantum field. A Resonance Pocket is the Pirouette framework's geometric precursor to this concept. It represents a stable, harmonic state within the fundamental topology of the Genesis Knot, functionally equivalent to a potential energy well where a particle state can exist without decay. The discrete nature and properties of these pockets are proposed to be the origin of the quantized particle spectrum and charge values seen in the Standard Model.
