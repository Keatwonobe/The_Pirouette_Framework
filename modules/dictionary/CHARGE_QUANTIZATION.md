    Charge is the winding number of a defect's internal clock. It counts how many full turns the clock must make on a journey through spacetime to return to its original phase, synchronized with the universal rhythm.
  law: |
    The total Berry holonomy accumulated by a spinor's time-phase clock along any closed path in its configuration space must be an integer multiple of 2π for its wavefunction to be single-valued. This constraint forces its coupling constant `q` to the background U(1) gauge field to exist only in discrete, integer multiples of a fundamental unit `q₀`.
  philosophy: |
    Charge Quantization elevates a seemingly arbitrary, empirically observed fact into a necessary consequence of geometric and topological consistency. It asserts that fundamental constants are not random numbers but are fixed by the structural integrity of the underlying physical substrate, linking the existence of discrete matter (defects) to the discreteness of their interactions.
pirouette_definition: |
  Charge (`q`) is the quantized coupling constant that governs the interaction between a spinor Ki-defect and the U(1) gauge field (`Aμ`), representing the energetic cost of synchronizing the spinor's internal time-phase clock with the local time-phase of the background medium. Its quantization arises from the requirement that the total Berry holonomy (`γ_C`), integrated along a closed loop encircling the Ki-defect's core, must be a multiple of 2π to ensure the spinor's state is single-valued. This holonomy includes contributions from both the spinor's intrinsic winding (`w`) and the external gauge field, fixing `q` to integer multiples of a fundamental unit determined by the system's base topology.

          3. Recombine the beams and observe the interference pattern.
          4. The phase shift (`Δφ`) will be proportional to the enclosed flux (`Φ_B`) and the particle's charge `q`: `Δφ = qΦ_B / ħ`. The quantization of `q` across different particle species can be verified by observing that `Δφ` changes in discrete, rational steps.

      Let (\mathcal{C}) be a closed path encircling the Ki loop’s core in configuration space. The Berry holonomy is (\gamma_\mathcal{C} = \oint_{\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{A}). Single-valued physics requires (e^{,i \gamma_\mathcal{C}}=1), so (\gamma_\mathcal{C} = 2\pi n). This yields quantized (q) tied to the integer winding of the Ki loop: (q = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_A},(w-n)\ \in\ \mathbb{Z}\cdot q_0).

    excerpt: |
      **Charge universality** = **one U(1) time-phase** + **defect winding**. In practice, fixing one species (electron) to charge (-e) sets the unit (q_0); all other charged spinor Ki-defects share the same (|q|) by the single-clock postulate. Falsifiability: any evidence that electrons and muons carry different *fundamental* U(1) couplings (beyond known EW effects) would break the single-clock assumption.

  disambiguation: |
    While Dirac's argument for charge quantization relies on the hypothetical existence of magnetic monopoles, the Pirouette framework derives it from the necessary single-valuedness of the spinor wavefunction itself, whose internal structure (the Ki loop) provides the non-trivial topology. The quantization is intrinsic to the nature of matter, not contingent on the existence of other particle types.

# Charge Quantization

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Charge (`q`) is the quantized coupling constant governing the synchronization of a spinor Ki-defect's internal time-phase clock with the background U(1) field. Its quantization is a direct consequence of topological self-consistency: for the spinor's wavefunction to be single-valued, the total Berry phase acquired when traversing a closed loop around its core must be a multiple of 2π. This constraint locks the value of `q` into integer multiples of a fundamental unit (`q₀`), tying a fundamental constant of nature to the integer winding number of the defect's internal geometry.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory and the Standard Model, electric charge is the conserved quantity, associated with U(1) gauge symmetry, that determines the strength of the electromagnetic interaction. Its value is observed to be quantized—all free particles have charges that are integer multiples of the elementary charge `e`. The Pirouette Framework provides a first-principles derivation for this quantization, identifying charge as a topological invariant (a winding number) arising from the requirement that the matter fields (spinors) be single-valued functions on spacetime. This approach maps directly to the standard QED vertex (`q \bar\Psi \gamma^\mu A_\mu \Psi`) but grounds the value of `q` in the geometry of the fermion.
