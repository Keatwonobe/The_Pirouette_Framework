      snippet: |
        The Condition for Rupture is not a static threshold but a dynamic decline. A system enters a state of critical risk when its coherence begins to actively degrade, a condition marked by a negative time-derivative of the Lagrangian: ∂𝓛_p / ∂t < 0. The rupture event itself is the phase transition that occurs when the Lagrangian crosses zero (𝓛_p ≤ 0).

  art: |
    The moment a system's song shatters, when the cost of holding form becomes greater than the peace it provides. It is the sound of a resonant pattern admitting it can no longer afford to exist.
  law: |
    A system will undergo a coherence cascade when its Pirouette Lagrangian becomes non-positive (𝓛_p ≤ 0). A sustained negative time-derivative of the Lagrangian (∂𝓛_p / ∂t < 0) is the primary leading indicator of an impending rupture.
  philosophy: |
    This condition reframes failure not as a material flaw but as an economic inevitability. It marks the point where existence itself becomes an act of self-destruction, forcing a phase transition to a state of lower coherence to escape an unsustainable 'energetic debt'.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Condition for Rupture is the dynamic state where a system's Pirouette Lagrangian becomes non-positive (𝓛_p ≤ 0). This indicates that the ambient Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) has overwhelmed the system's Temporal Coherence (K_τ), making the cost of maintaining structural integrity unsustainable. At this point, collapse into a less ordered state becomes the path of least resistance. The condition is often preceded by a sustained negative time-derivative (∂𝓛_p / ∂t < 0), which serves as the primary leading indicator of critical risk.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless condition (boolean true/false) based on the Lagrangian, which has units of action (J·s) or energy (J) depending on the formulation.

        outline: |
          1. Map domain-specific stressors and resistances to quantitative proxies for Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) and Temporal Coherence (K_τ).
          2. Calculate the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ) as a time series.
          3. Monitor the value of 𝓛_p and its time-derivative (∂𝓛_p / ∂t).
          4. The condition is met when 𝓛_p crosses or falls below zero.
        expected_signals: [A decaying 𝓛_p value over time (∂𝓛_p / ∂t < 0), A crossing of the 𝓛_p = 0 threshold coinciding with a systemic phase transition (e.g., fracture, schism).]
        pitfalls: [Mis-calibration of V_Γ or K_τ proxies, leading to false positives/negatives. Failure to account for non-linear coherence degradation near the system's yield point.]

    excerpt: |
      The rupture event itself is the phase transition that occurs when the Lagrangian crosses zero (𝓛_p ≤ 0). At this point, the system has lost the "energetic profit" of its own existence; its form creates more stress than it resolves, and a collapse into a simpler, less coherent state becomes the path of least resistance.
  - module: DOMA-131
    excerpt: |
      Monitor the Lagrangian: Track the system's overall 𝓛_p in near-real-time. A sustained negative trend in ∂𝓛_p / ∂t is the most potent leading indicator of an impending rupture, serving as an early warning system. The goal of any intervention is to ensure 𝓛_p remains positive.

        L = (1/2)(∂_μ φ)² + (1/2)m²φ² - ...  (where m² < 0)
      justification: |
        The condition 𝓛_p ≤ 0 signifies that the 'potential' cost of a system's configuration (V_Γ) exceeds its structural integrity 'kinetic' term (K_τ). This is analogous to a tachyonic field, where a negative mass-squared term in the Lagrangian potential indicates that the vacuum state is unstable and will decay catastrophically into a new, true vacuum. Both describe a state where the current configuration is energetically 'unprofitable' and a phase transition is inevitable.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from simple material failure criteria (e.g., tensile strength), which are typically static thresholds. The Pirouette Condition for Rupture is a dynamic state within the system's total energy-time budget, applicable to non-physical systems (e.g., social, economic) and defined by the Lagrangian crossing zero, not by a single material property.
