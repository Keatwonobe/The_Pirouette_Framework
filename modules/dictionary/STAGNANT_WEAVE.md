        Pathology (The Stagnant Weave / A Dark Age):
        One or more threads are blocked or have choked the others, creating a "Coherence Dam" and causing "Coherence Atrophy." A society of only Law is a brittle tyranny. A society of only Art is an unsustainable chaos. A society of only Philosophy is a sterile abstraction. Progress halts, and the culture becomes vulnerable to collapse.

triad:
  art: |
    A frozen mural, a song played on repeat until the notes wear away. It is the silence where a new story should be, the death of the culture's capacity to dream.
  law: |
    A Stagnant Weave is operationally identified when the rate of generation of new cultural engrams (artistic, scientific, philosophical) approaches zero over a period exceeding one generation, while the metrics of structural enforcement and repetition (e.g., legal precedent, ritual observance) remain high or increase. The ratio of novel-to-legacy memes drops below a critical threshold for adaptation.
  philosophy: |
    This state reveals that stability without novelty is a slow death. It is a cautionary tale against mistaking structural inertia for resilience, demonstrating that a culture's ability to adapt—to re-weave itself—is the ultimate measure of its vitality.
pirouette_definition: |
  A pathological state of a socio-cultural system, defined within the Triaxial Loom model, where the dynamic interplay between the threads of Art, Law, and Philosophy ceases. It is characterized by the blockage or hypertrophy of one or more threads at the expense of others, leading to a halt in cultural morphogenesis, a decay of coherence (Coherence Atrophy), and an increased vulnerability to collapse under Temporal Pressure.

        outline: |
          1. Define and measure time-series proxies for the output of each cultural thread over a multi-generational period (>50 years). Proxies include: Art (emergence of new stylistic movements), Law (rate of legislative reform vs. enforcement actions), Philosophy (rate of emergence of new formal schools of thought).
          2. Calculate the rate of change (flow, dQ/dt) and variance (σ²) for each thread's output.
          3. A Stagnant Weave is indicated when the flow rate of one or two threads approaches zero (e.g., dQ_Art/dt ≈ 0) while the third remains static or increases in repetition/enforcement (e.g., high Q_Law, but dQ_Law/dt ≈ 0). The total variance of the cultural output manifold contracts significantly.
        expected_signals: [Dramatic decrease in patent filings or emergence of new artistic genres, high "nostalgia index" in cultural products, increased codification of dogma with little structural reform.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking a temporary period of consolidation for long-term stagnation; proxy selection bias (e.g., measuring only state-sanctioned art).]

      justification: |
        A Stagnant Weave is a cultural system whose internal feedback loops (Law, dogma) have become so strong (high damping γ) that they suppress any new perturbation or oscillation (Art, Philosophy). The system is trapped at a stable, but non-progressive, fixed point (equilibrium). It cannot respond adaptively to new inputs because its restorative forces are too slow and powerful.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from `Turbulent Weave`, where cultural threads are in active, high-energy conflict rather than being suppressed or atrophied. Stagnation is a 'cold' pathology (low energy, low novelty); turbulence is a 'hot' one (high energy, destructive novelty).

# Stagnant Weave

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A pathological state of a socio-cultural system, defined within the Triaxial Loom model, where the dynamic interplay between the threads of Art, Law, and Philosophy ceases. It is characterized by the blockage or hypertrophy of one or more threads at the expense of others, leading to a halt in cultural morphogenesis, a decay of coherence (Coherence Atrophy), and an increased vulnerability to collapse under Temporal Pressure.

## EFT-First Summary
*This term does not yet have an adopted EFT mapping. A candidate mapping describes the Stagnant Weave as an overdamped system in classical dynamics, where strong damping forces (analogous to rigid Law or dogma) prevent oscillation or response to new inputs, trapping the system at a stable but non-adaptive fixed point.*
