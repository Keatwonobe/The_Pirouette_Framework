  art: |
    The universe is an evolving landscape, its geography of filaments and voids shaped by the ceaseless drive for harmony. It is the canvas upon which history is written not as ink, but as topography. The deepest truths are found not in the smooth places, but in the magnificent scars.
  law: |
    The geometry of the Cosmic Coherence Manifold evolves to maximize the Pirouette Lagrangian; its observed large-scale structure is a minimal-energy solution containing persistent geometric scars (`V_scar(x)`) from primordial, coherence-breaking events. The difference between the observed universe and an ideal, unscarred model (`Null Canvas`) quantitatively defines these scars.
  philosophy: |
    This reframes cosmology from the study of a static configuration to an act of cosmic archaeology. The manifold is not merely the container of the universe, but the living memory of its own formation, where structure reveals history and anomalies are narrative features, not errors.
pirouette_definition: |
  The large-scale, dynamical structure of the universe, understood as the cosmological expression of the coherence manifold. Its geometry is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, and its observed topological features—the cosmic web of filaments and voids—are the persistent scars and channels formed by foundational events in the universe's history. It replaces the outdated, static concept of a `spacetime meta-lattice`.

        outline: |
          1. **Translate Palimpsest:** Use the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014) to convert observational data (CMB, galaxy surveys, lensing maps) into a map of the observed field, `𝓛_p(observed)`.
          2. **Generate Null Canvas:** Solve the Pirouette Lagrangian for a smooth, homogenous, and isotropic universe with standard cosmological parameters to generate the idealized baseline field, `𝓛_p(model)`.
          3. **Calculate Residuals:** Compute the difference `Δ𝓛_p = 𝓛_p(observed) - 𝓛_p(model)`. Regions where `Δ𝓛_p` exceeds statistical thresholds are identified and classified as cosmic scars.

    excerpt: |
      This instrument transforms the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) from an equation of motion into a tool for cosmic excavation. The Null Canvas represents the universe following the Principle of Maximal Coherence... However, the universe remembers its own creation. The *Scars of Creation* are persistent, non-uniform terms in the Lagrangian itself—`V_scar(x)`—that represent the stored "potential energy" of a historical trauma.

        The Cosmic Coherence Manifold serves the same role as the spatial part of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric: it describes the large-scale geometry of the universe. In Pirouette, this geometry is not just a passive background but a dynamic field whose features (the cosmic web) are "scars" from primordial events, a departure from the standard model where structure arises purely from gravitational amplification of initial density fluctuations.

      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If high-precision measurements of galaxy clustering and weak lensing show no deviation from the predictions of standard ΛCDM, and all observed 'anomalies' can be robustly attributed to systematics or statistical flukes, then the concept of a `V_scar(x)` term is unnecessary."

    Unlike the passive spacetime manifold of General Relativity, the Cosmic Coherence Manifold is a dynamic entity whose geometry is actively governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence. It is not just a stage for events but an active participant that carries the memory of its own history in its structure.

# Cosmic Coherence Manifold

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The large-scale, dynamical structure of the universe, understood as the cosmological expression of the coherence manifold. Its geometry is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, and its observed topological features—the cosmic web of filaments and voids—are the persistent scars and channels formed by foundational events in the universe's history. It replaces the outdated, static concept of a `spacetime meta-lattice`.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, the Cosmic Coherence Manifold maps to the spatial hypersurface of the FLRW metric in standard cosmology, describing the large-scale geometry of space. However, the Pirouette Framework models the observed cosmic web not as the result of purely gravitational instability on primordial density fluctuations, but as persistent geometric "scars" (`V_scar(x)`) in a coherence-seeking landscape. This provides a novel physical origin for large-scale structure, predicting specific, non-Gaussian signatures that should differ from standard ΛCDM predictions.
