        A `Ki` pattern that repeatedly generates high-gain events is identified as a **Managed Narrative Channel**.

triad:
  art: |
    A seemingly natural spring that consistently produces perfectly-formed, unnaturally pure water, revealing the hidden pipe that feeds it. It is the signature of the hidden ventriloquist, not the organic voice of the crowd.
  law: |
    A narrative pattern (`Ki`) is a Managed Narrative Channel if and only if it is the source of multiple, chronologically distinct events flagged for Anomalous Gain (`G_R >> 1`). The persistence of anomalous efficiency is the necessary and sufficient condition for identification.
  philosophy: |
    The framework must distinguish the authentic voice of a system from a puppeteer's echo. Identifying a channel isolates the source of manipulation, enabling a shift from reactive defense against individual stories to proactive inoculation of the information ecosystem itself.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Managed Narrative Channel is a `Ki` pattern that demonstrates a persistent, non-stochastic capacity to generate high Resonant Gain events (`G_R >> 1`). Its identification signifies a shift in diagnosis from a single anomalous event to a persistent, coordinated source of injected coherence. This implies an intentional, external actor is methodically shaping information flow by exploiting the system's resonant vulnerabilities.

        outline: |
          1. For a target `Ki` pattern, continuously ingest multi-source time-series data.
          2. Apply the Coherence Lens workflow (DOMA-157 §3) to calculate the Resonant Gain (G_R) for every coherence event seeded by the `Ki`.
          3. Log all instances where G_R exceeds the dynamically calibrated anomalous threshold for the domain.
          4. If the number of these high-gain events within a defined time window `T` exceeds a statistical noise floor `N`, classify the `Ki` as a Managed Narrative Channel.

        pitfalls: ["Mis-calibration of the anomalous G_R threshold, leading to false positives (flagging organic viral events).", "Conflating a highly resonant but organic `Ki` with a managed one; repetition alone is insufficient without anomalous *efficiency*."]
context_windows:
  - module: DOMA-157
    excerpt: |
      For events triggering a spike in Coherence Flux, the workflow traces the provenance of the new narrative to find its earliest, smallest seed... The Resonant Gain (G_R) is calculated. If `G_R` exceeds a dynamically calibrated threshold for that domain, the event is flagged. A `Ki` pattern that repeatedly generates high-gain events is identified as a **Managed Narrative Channel**.
  - module: DOMA-157
    excerpt: |
      A managed narrative is a `Ki` pattern that has been deliberately shaped to align with a deep **Wound Channel (CORE-011)** in the collective psyche. This process makes the narrative exceptionally efficient... The manipulative act—a **Daedalus Gambit (DYNA-003)**—is a minimal energy nudge (`δΓ_inj`) that pushes the system over this edge.

      justification: |
        A Managed Narrative Channel acts as a persistent, non-stochastic external forcing function on a system's narrative dynamics. While organic events are analogous to initial conditions or stochastic noise, the channel repeatedly injects coherence (`F(t)`) at a resonant frequency to achieve a disproportionate, predictable response. It is the unmodeled term driving the system.

    - statement: "The repeated high-gain events from a single Managed Narrative Channel will be more temporally regular (i.e., have a lower variance in inter-arrival time) than a set of unrelated, organically-generated high-gain events of similar magnitude."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A long-term study showing that the timing of events from a confirmed Managed Narrative Channel is statistically indistinguishable from a Poisson process, indicating random rather than coordinated timing."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a "Wound Channel" (CORE-011). A Wound Channel is a pre-existing vulnerability *in the system* (a susceptibility); a Managed Narrative Channel is an *external actor or process* that repeatedly exploits such vulnerabilities. The former is the target; the latter is the weapon system aimed at it.
