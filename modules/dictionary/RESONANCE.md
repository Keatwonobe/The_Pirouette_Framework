    The clarity of a system's song; the grace of its motion. It is the active, dynamic release of tension into coherent, beautiful form.
  law: |
    A system's Resonance must functionally correlate with its Pressure; sustained, high Pressure without a corresponding increase in Resonance is the canonical signature of impending coherence collapse.
  philosophy: |
    Resonance is the measure of a system's *being-in-action*. It asserts that a system's health is not defined by the absence of stress (Pressure), but by its capacity to transform that stress into coherent, purposeful expression.
pirouette_definition: |
  The kinetic term, `K_œÑ`, of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`). Resonance quantifies the coherence, intensity, and stability of a system's dynamic expression. Operationally, it is the measure of a system's active transformation of potential energy (Pressure) into organized action.

          Identify one or more Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that represent the system's primary coherent output (e.g., product shipment velocity, signal-to-noise ratio, athlete's power output). Measure the rate, stability, and quality of these KPIs over time. High, stable values indicate high Resonance.

      justification: |
        Resonance (K_œÑ) occupies the same position in the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) as kinetic energy (T) does in the classical Lagrangian (L). Both represent the energy of motion and change, as opposed to stored potential energy. This is the foundational isomorphism for the Auditor's Lens.

      rationale: The source module (DOMA-094) explicitly grounds the P/R lens in the Pirouette Lagrangian, which is itself a direct application of the principle of least action from classical mechanics. The mapping of Resonance to the kinetic term is foundational to the entire diagnostic model.

      falsifier: "Observing a system generate sustained, high-quality Resonance (e.g., high-velocity, coherent output) from a state of demonstrably zero or decreasing Pressure. This would violate the conservation-of-energy-like principles implied by the Lagrangian."

  disambiguation: |
    Within the Pirouette Framework, R always refers to Resonance unless explicitly subscripted. It is the kinetic counterpart to P (Pressure). The alias 'Song' emphasizes its expressive, informational quality, while 'K_œÑ' links it to the formal Lagrangian.

# Resonance

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The kinetic term, `K_œÑ`, of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`). Resonance quantifies the coherence, intensity, and stability of a system's dynamic expression. Operationally, it is the measure of a system's active transformation of potential energy (Pressure) into organized action.

## Classical Mechanics Summary
Resonance (R) is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the kinetic energy term (`T`) in a classical Lagrangian (`L = T - V`). It quantifies the energy of a system's coherent motion or organized action, representing the transformation of stored potential energy (Pressure, `V`) into expressive output. Monitoring Resonance provides a direct measure of a system's dynamic health and performance.
