      snippet: |
        This art, which replaces "Serendipity Resonance," addresses the act of extracting order from chaos. The Temporal Forge (CORE-003) is a chaotic environment, but its noise contains rare, stochastic peaks of immense coherence. This art is about building a "sail" to catch these winds.

  art: |
    To build a sail to catch the winds of chance; to listen for a moment of cosmic silence and fill it with a startling, beautiful improvisation.
  law: |
    A system in a state of high receptive readiness (low activation energy, high temporal bandwidth) will capture ambient coherence peaks at a rate proportional to the local variance of the temporal pressure field, œÉ¬≤(Œì).
  philosophy: |
    Instead of imposing order on the universe, true efficiency comes from recognizing and accepting the order the universe freely offers. Stochastic Harvesting reframes innovation from an act of will to an act of exquisitely prepared listening.
pirouette_definition: |
  The strategy of engineering a system to act as a high-sensitivity receiver for rare, high-amplitude, naturally-occurring fluctuations in the ambient coherence manifold. The system maintains a state of poised readiness, coupling to these stochastic peaks to capture "free" coherence, which is then stored in a Coherence Resonator for subsequent work via a Lagrangian Transducer. It does not alter the system's intrinsic properties but exploits favorable, transient environmental conditions to gain a net positive value for the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p).

          Expose a calibrated Coherence Resonator, decoupled from any active transducer, to the target environment. Monitor the resonator's coherence level K_œÑ(t) over time using a non-invasive Ki-probe. Spontaneous, sharp increases in K_œÑ not attributable to internal dynamics or deliberate input represent harvested coherence events. The integral of these pulses over time gives the total harvested coherence.

    excerpt: |
      A system designed for Stochastic Harvesting is not an engine but an exquisitely sensitive antenna. It maintains a state of poised readiness, constantly scanning the ambient temporal pressure for naturally occurring, high-coherence events. When such a peak is detected, the system instantly latches onto it, capturing a burst of "free" coherence that can be used to perform work.
  - module: DOMA-041
    excerpt: |
      Stochastic Harvesting plays the entire equation. It does not try to alter the system's own K_œÑ or V_Œì. Instead, it waits for moments when the external environment provides a massive, temporary spike in coherence, effectively getting a favorable Lagrangian for free.

        Stochastic Resonance is a phenomenon where a weak signal in a nonlinear system can be amplified by adding noise. Stochastic Harvesting is the Pirouette analog, where the 'system' is a Coherence Resonator tuned with a capture threshold (potential barrier) and the 'noise' is the ambient temporal pressure field, which contains rare, high-coherence 'signals' that the system is tuned to capture.

# Stochastic Harvesting

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The strategy of engineering a system to act as a high-sensitivity receiver for rare, high-amplitude, naturally-occurring fluctuations in the ambient coherence manifold. The system maintains a state of poised readiness, coupling to these stochastic peaks to capture "free" coherence, which is then stored in a Coherence Resonator for subsequent work via a Lagrangian Transducer. It does not alter the system's intrinsic properties but exploits favorable, transient environmental conditions to gain a net positive value for the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p).

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, Stochastic Harvesting maps to the physical concept of **Stochastic Resonance**. In this model, the Coherence Resonator is a nonlinear system tuned near a potential barrier separating a low-coherence ground state from a high-coherence capture state. Ambient fluctuations in the temporal pressure field (Œì) act as a noise source that can occasionally provide enough energy to "kick" the system over the barrier, capturing order from the environment's random fluctuations in a manner consistent with the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem.
