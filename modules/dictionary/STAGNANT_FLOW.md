  art: |
    A river of discourse turned to ice, where truths, once fluid, become brittle prisons. Pressure builds beneath the silent surface, awaiting a thaw or a shattering.
  law: |
    A discursive system is in Stagnant Flow if the rate of novel information exchange between participants approaches zero for a sustained period, while metrics of ideological entrenchment remain high and constant. The system becomes a closed loop, consuming energy without performing work.
  philosophy: |
    Stagnant Flow is not merely a failure of communication but a critical diagnostic marker. It reveals that the current conceptual frameworks are exhausted, signaling that progress requires not further debate within existing terms, but a collective leap—an Alchemical Union—to a new, more encompassing frame of reference.
pirouette_definition: |
  Stagnant Flow is a state in discursive dynamics, diagnosed when the exchange of meaningful information between participants ceases due to the rigidity of their perspectives. Characterized as a 'Coherence Dam,' it represents a halt in the collaborative weaving of understanding, leading to a build-up of unresolved Temporal Pressure. In the Ritual of Synthesis, this state is not an endpoint but a formal trigger for the Alchemical Attempt, compelling a shift from debate to the co-creation of a new, synthesized position (Kτ_c).

        outline: |
          Monitor a debate corpus (transcripts, interaction logs). Use semantic analysis to track the introduction of novel concepts versus repetition of established positions (calculating dI/dt). Concurrently, measure participant response patterns to contradictory evidence to model Entrenchment (Eᵢ). Stagnant Flow is inferred when dI/dt falls below a baseline threshold while the average Eᵢ for the system remains above a critical threshold for a sustained duration.

    excerpt: |
      When an impasse (Stagnant Flow) is reached, the ritual shifts. The old "Ideological Schism" is not an endpoint, but a trigger for this final, most creative act. All Weavers must cease defending their own threads and focus exclusively on a new task: collaboratively defining a new position that incorporates the strongest elements of the conflicting views. This conscious, focused effort is the crucible's fire, intended to spark the Resonant Synthesis.

        Stagnant Flow is analogous to a dynamical system trapped in a local minimum of its potential energy landscape. The system is stable (no change) but suboptimal. Overcoming the impasse (the "Alchemical Attempt") is equivalent to providing sufficient activation energy for the system to escape the local well and seek a more stable, global minimum (Resonant Synthesis).

        Like a computational deadlock, Stagnant Flow describes a state where multiple processes (participants) hold resources (perspectives) and wait for others to release theirs, resulting in a system-wide halt. Resolution requires an external protocol to break the circular dependency.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, Stagnant Flow refers exclusively to the flow of *information* or *coherence* within a discursive system, not a physical fluid. It is a diagnostic term for a specific type of communication failure characterized by mutual incomprehension and rigidity.

# Stagnant Flow

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Stagnant Flow is a state in discursive dynamics, diagnosed when the exchange of meaningful information between participants ceases due to the rigidity of their perspectives. Characterized as a 'Coherence Dam,' it represents a halt in the collaborative weaving of understanding, leading to a build-up of unresolved Temporal Pressure. In the Ritual of Synthesis, this state is not an endpoint but a formal trigger for the Alchemical Attempt, compelling a shift from debate to the co-creation of a new, synthesized position (Kτ_c).

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Stagnant Flow maps to a system trapped in a high-potential, local minimum of an energy landscape, such as a deadlock state in computation or a mechanical system with high static friction. Progress is halted as the system's components (participants) are unable to overcome the activation energy barrier required to transition to a more optimal, lower-energy state (synthesis). The state is characterized by zero "work" (information exchange) despite high internal "pressure" (disagreement).
