        Your Inner Strength is low. The energy and stability you once took for granted have been spent on the profound act of healing.

triad:
  art: |
    The deep, quiet reservoir of vitality from which healing flows. It is the calm harbor after the storm, the steady riverbed beneath the current of life, the foundational sum of a system's capacity to endure and regenerate.
  law: |
    A patient's rate of recovery is proportional to the net difference between their rate of Inner Strength regeneration and the total Burden on their system. When regeneration (dΣ/dt) exceeds Burden, recovery progresses; when Burden exceeds regeneration, the system degrades or stalls.
  philosophy: |
    Inner Strength reframes health not as the absence of disease, but as a quantifiable, cultivated capacity for resilience. It shifts the focus from fighting symptoms to rebuilding the core systemic resources that enable a state of effortless, self-sustaining flow.
pirouette_definition: |
  Inner Strength is the quantifiable, foundational capacity of a patient's system to maintain stability, adapt to stress, and perform the work of healing. It is a composite measure of physiological and psychological resilience, which is significantly depleted by major stressors like surgery and must be intentionally rebuilt through phased, rhythmic practices. It is operationally tracked via proxy metrics like autonomic nervous system tone (e.g., Resting Heart Rate, HRV) and subjective coherence.

        outline: |
          A daily composite score is generated from two inputs: 1) Objective physiological tone, measured by morning Resting Heart Rate (RHR) or Heart Rate Variability (HRV, rMSSD) tracked over a 7-day moving average. 2) Subjective coherence, rated on a 1-10 scale ("How 'in the flow' do I feel today?"). The two values are normalized and combined.
        expected_signals: [Decreasing RHR (7-day avg), Increasing HRV (7-day avg), Increasing subjective 'flow' score]
        pitfalls: [Confounding RHR readings due to medication (e.g., beta-blockers), Subjective score bias from transient mood fluctuations]

    excerpt: |
      Your Inner Strength is low. The energy and stability you once took for granted have been spent on the profound act of healing. The Burden on your body is high. Your system is dealing with the "noise" of inflammation, fatigue, and the stress of recovery. This is not a sign of failure; it is the honest starting point of every hero's journey.

      justification: |
        HRV is a direct, non-invasive measure of autonomic nervous system (ANS) tone, reflecting the body's capacity to adapt to stress. Higher HRV correlates with greater parasympathetic ('rest and digest') activity, which is essential for recovery and healing, mapping directly to the concept of Inner Strength as a resilient, adaptive capacity.

          date: 2017-08-28
      confidence: 0.9
  adopted:
    - target: Heart Rate Variability (HRV) as a primary quantitative proxy.
      rationale: "HRV provides a robust, clinically validated, and instrument-measurable proxy for the physiological resilience and adaptive capacity described as Inner Strength. It directly quantifies the 'calm harbor' and 'steady rhythm' aspects of the concept."
      confidence: 0.9
constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Daily practices that measurably increase Heart Rate Variability (e.g., resonant breathing, consistent sleep) will increase a patient's rate of post-operative recovery, as defined by reduced inflammation markers and faster return to functional baselines."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "A randomized controlled trial shows no statistically significant difference in recovery outcomes between a cohort performing HRV-increasing practices and a control group, despite a measurable increase in HRV in the test group."

  disambiguation: |
    Inner Strength (Σ) is a measure of a system's *capacity* for recovery and stability, not to be confused with 'Will' or 'Motivation', which are psychological drivers. It is the direct antonym of 'Burden', which represents the sum of active stressors on the system. A patient can have high Will but low Inner Strength.
