        Pathology (The Turbulent Weave / A Period of Strife):
        The threads are tangled in direct conflict, creating systemic "Coherence Fever." Art becomes pure iconoclasm, seeking only to destroy Law. Law becomes rigid dogma, seeking only to crush Art. Philosophy splinters into warring camps, unable to find a harmonizing signal. The culture wastes its energy on internal friction, leading to polarization, cynicism, and social decay.

triad:
  art: |
    Art becomes a hammer, not a chisel. It seeks only to shatter the forms of the past, mistaking deconstruction for creation and shouting for song.
  law: |
    A socio-cultural system in Turbulent Weave exhibits an increase in the ratio of punitive/restrictive legislation to generative/enabling legislation. The system's energy shifts from building shared structures to policing internal boundaries.
  philosophy: |
    The central function of philosophy—synthesis—fails. Instead of weaving Art and Law into a higher-order coherence, it becomes a justification engine for pre-existing schisms, sharpening the blades of ideological conflict.
pirouette_definition: |
  A pathological state of a socio-cultural system, defined within the Triaxial Loom model, where the fundamental threads of coherence—Art, Law, and Philosophy—are in a state of mutually-destructive conflict. This condition is characterized by the conversion of coherent cultural energy into dissipative internal friction, manifesting as severe political polarization, social distrust, and systemic paralysis. It is a failure mode where the system expends more energy on internal conflict than on adaptive responses to temporal pressure (Γ).
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (expressible as a Cultural Reynolds Number)
  symbol_table:
    - name: Re_c
      meaning: Cultural Reynolds Number; a ratio of inertial (destabilizing, iconoclastic) cultural dynamics to viscous (stabilizing, traditional) dynamics.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: Re_c > 4000 indicates transition to turbulence.

      - name: Triaxial Dissonance Analysis
        outline: |
          1. **Art Thread Analysis:** Quantify the ratio of iconoclastic vs. integrative themes in high-impact cultural products (film, literature, visual arts) over a 5-year window.
          2. **Law Thread Analysis:** Measure the legislative velocity of restrictive social laws versus the Gini coefficient and other measures of social inequity. A high velocity of restriction coupled with high inequality is a strong indicator.
          3. **Philosophy Thread Analysis:** Perform citation network analysis on academic and media corpora. High modularity and low cross-cluster citation rates indicate philosophical splintering.
          4. **Composite Score:** Normalize and combine metrics. A sustained high score across all three threads confirms a Turbulent Weave.
        expected_signals: [High sentiment polarization in public discourse, legislative gridlock on constructive projects, proliferation of "cancel culture" from both Art and Law camps, decline in cross-factional collaboration.]
        pitfalls: [Confusing healthy revolutionary fervor with pathological turbulence; misinterpreting short-term political disputes as long-term systemic decay; sampling bias in cultural product analysis.]

    excerpt: |
      A healthy society is one that dynamically adjusts the interplay of its threads—loosening Law to allow for artistic innovation in times of change, or strengthening it to provide stability in times of chaos—to maintain a path of maximal coherence. A cultural collapse is the ultimate failure to find a viable solution to this equation.

        dK/dt = P - ε
        (Rate of change of kinetic energy = Production - Dissipation)
      justification: |
        In fluid dynamics, turbulence is a state where energy injected at large scales is not organized into coherent flow but cascades down to smaller scales and dissipates as heat (ε). A Turbulent Weave is the socio-cultural analogue: large-scale cultural potential (Ki) is dissipated by macro-conflicts (Art vs. Law) into micro-friction (social polarization, tribalism), producing systemic heat ("Coherence Fever") instead of constructive work. The "Cultural Reynolds Number" (Re_c) formalizes this analogy.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from "Revolutionary Crucible" or "Alchemical Union," which are also periods of high stress but are fundamentally synthetic and creative. A Turbulent Weave is a degenerative state where conflict is entropic and self-perpetuating, not a means to a higher-order synthesis. The system is stuck in a dissipative loop rather than progressing through a phase transition.
