        When this instrument detects a shared resonance, it has found empirical evidence that these disparate systems are navigating the *same **macro-geodesic***. Subjected to a sufficiently powerful shared pressure, they have abandoned their individual paths for a new, collective path of least resistance.

  art: |
    Disparate streams, once carving their own canyons through reality, are drawn into a single, massive riverbed by a continental tilt. They flow together along a new, inevitable course dictated by the shared landscape.
  law: |
    The existence of a macro-geodesic is confirmed when the phase-locking value (PLV) of multiple, disparate systemic variables exceeds a coherence threshold (e.g., PLV > 0.8) at a persistent, shared frequency (ωk). The trajectory of the phase-leading system defines the geodesic's vector.
  philosophy: |
    The macro-geodesic reveals that systemic causality is not always local or domain-specific. It demonstrates that under sufficient shared stress, the universe favors collective, coherent solutions, overriding individual system dynamics and exposing a deeper, unifying architecture of influence.
pirouette_definition: |
  An emergent, collective path of least action that two or more dynamically distinct systems follow when their individual state-space trajectories become phase-locked due to a shared, resonant forcing function (a Macro-Γ). It represents the unified solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) for a multi-system manifold, inferred empirically via the detection of a Resonant Concordance.

        outline: |
          1. Select 2+ disparate domains (e.g., economics, public health).
          2. Normalize primary time-series variables from each domain into universal framework variables like Temporal Pressure (Γ) and Coherence (Kτ).
          3. Perform cross-spectral analysis to identify a shared resonant frequency (ωk) and measure the Phase-Locking Value (PLV) at that frequency.
          4. A sustained high PLV (> threshold) confirms the systems are on a shared macro-geodesic.

    excerpt: |
      The discovery of a strong Resonant Concordance is a profound physical statement. According to the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), each system follows the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—on its local manifold. When this instrument detects a shared resonance, it has found empirical evidence that these disparate systems are navigating the *same **macro-geodesic***. Subjected to a sufficiently powerful shared pressure, they have abandoned their individual paths for a new, collective path of least resistance. The threads are not just coincidentally similar; they are all flowing downhill along the same cosmic contour.

      justification: |
        The Macro-geodesic analogizes the path of a test particle in a gravitational field. A powerful, shared Temporal Pressure (Macro-Γ) acts like a massive object, warping the multi-system 'manifold,' forcing all affected systems to follow the same curved path of least resistance, rather than their individual 'flat-space' trajectories.

      justification: |
        When coupled oscillators (systems) synchronize under a strong coupling constant K (Macro-Γ), they cease independent motion and fall into a common, collective trajectory. The macro-geodesic is the path of the system within this shared basin of attraction.

  claims:
    - statement: "Given two systems A and B locked on a macro-geodesic where A is the phase leader, an exogenous intervention that successfully decouples system B from the shared resonance will not significantly alter the trajectory of system A."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If decoupling system B (the follower) causes a significant, non-random change in the dynamics of system A (the leader), it would falsify the claim that A's path defines an independent geodesic and suggest a more complex, bidirectional coupling."

  disambiguation: |
    A 'geodesic' in Pirouette refers to a single system's path of maximal coherence (per `CORE-006`). A 'Macro-geodesic' is not the path of a single system, but a *shared, collective* path that emerges when multiple systems are phase-locked by a common influence. It is an emergent property of the multi-system manifold, not an intrinsic property of any single constituent.
