  art: |
    The single number that sings the team's song. It is the chord struck by adding the notes of unity, toughness, and intelligence into a single, resonant measure of potential.
  law: |
    Overall Coherence is the arithmetic sum of a team's Rhythmic Cohesion, Composure Under Pressure, and Strategic Adaptability scores. Each component is measured on a 1-10 integer scale, yielding a final value between 3 and 30.
  philosophy: |
    To predict the outcome of a contest between two complex systems, one must first quantify their respective states. Overall Coherence provides this essential, scalar measure of system health, enabling direct comparison and calculation of relative potential.
pirouette_definition: |
  A scalar metric representing the total measured coherence of a team-scale system. It is calculated as the sum of its three primary coherence signatures: Rhythmic Cohesion, Composure Under Pressure, and Strategic Adaptability. This value serves as the primary input for calculating relative system health and predictive outputs like Victor Tilt.

          1. For a given team, conduct a qualitative observation of its performance over a defined time window (e.g., 5-10 minutes of game time).
          2. Using the Cohesion Gauge, Resilience Meter, and Morphogenesis Index rubrics, assign an integer score from 1-10 for each of the three coherence signatures.
          3. Sum the three scores to calculate KœÑ_team for that time window.

    excerpt: |
      The Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`) mathematically describes a system's drive to find the path of highest internal coherence (`K_œÑ`) for the lowest environmental cost (`V_Œì`). A team in Laminar Flow is one that is successfully navigating its geodesic. Its actions are efficient, its internal rhythm is strong, and it is effectively managing the temporal pressure (`Œì`) applied by the opponent.

        The source module (DOMA-099) explicitly structures its core equation, the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p), as a direct analog to the classical Lagrangian (ùìõ). In this mapping, KœÑ represents the system's internal, organized capacity for coherent action, analogous to how kinetic energy represents organized motion.

    "KœÑ_team" specifically refers to the calculated, team-scale metric from DOMA-099. It should be distinguished from the more abstract concept of internal coherence, "KœÑ", as it appears in the foundational Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), of which KœÑ_team is a specific operationalization.

# Overall Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A scalar metric representing the total measured coherence of a team-scale system. It is calculated as the sum of its three primary coherence signatures: Rhythmic Cohesion, Composure Under Pressure, and Strategic Adaptability. This value serves as the primary input for calculating relative system health and predictive outputs like Victor Tilt.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of classical mechanics, Overall Coherence (KœÑ_team) is the operational measure of a system's "kinetic term" in the Pirouette Lagrangian. It quantifies the system's capacity for organized, internal action, representing its effective "energy" available to pursue its goals, as opposed to the "potential cost" imposed by environmental pressures (V_Œì).
