      snippet: |
        The fundamental parameters (μ_ν,p,q) are not universal constants. Instead, they define a continuous, two-dimensional surface within their three-dimensional parameter space. Any point on this surface represents a valid, self-consistent physical reality. A neutrino is not defined by a single set of parameters, but by a "knot" configuration that lies somewhere on this prime resonance manifold.

  art: |
    The neutrino is not a static object, but a dynamic equilibrium—a knot of pure geometry, tied perfectly on a surface of possibility.
  law: |
    The fundamental parameters (μ_ν, p, q) of the Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law are not universal constants but define a continuous, two-dimensional Prime Resonance Manifold of valid solutions. A specific neutrino's properties correspond to a specific point ('knot') on this manifold, potentially varying with its production environment.
  philosophy: |
    The Knot Hypothesis reframes physical law from a rigid decree to a geometric relationship. It suggests the universe is not built on a single, immutable foundation, but is woven from a fabric that allows for an infinite number of valid knots, each a perfect expression of the underlying resonance.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Knot Hypothesis proposes that neutrinos exist as distinct, stable configurations ('knots') on the Prime Resonance Manifold. Each knot is a specific point (μ_ν, p, q) that satisfies the Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law, and the choice of knot may depend on the neutrino's production environment. This implies the fundamental parameters governing neutrino mass are not universal constants but variables constrained to a specific geometric surface.

      - name: Manifold Constraint via High-Precision Oscillation Data
        outline: |
          Precisely measure neutrino oscillation parameters (mixing angles, mass-squared differences). Use the Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law to solve for the required (μ_ν, p, q) triplet. Repeat for multiple datasets from different experiments (solar, reactor, atmospheric) to trace out, constrain, or falsify the predicted Prime Resonance Manifold.
        expected_signals: [A tight, continuous, two-dimensional correlation between fitted values of (μ_ν, p, q) across all datasets.]
        pitfalls: [Measurement uncertainties in oscillation parameters being too large to resolve the manifold's structure, Unaccounted-for systematic effects mimicking a geometric constraint.]
      - name: Absolute Mass Anomaly Search
        outline: |
          Develop experiments (e.g., next-gen KATRIN, Project 8) capable of measuring absolute neutrino mass with sub-meV precision. Compare the absolute mass of neutrinos from different sources (e.g., tritium decay vs. solar neutrinos). A statistically significant difference in absolute mass, while oscillation parameters remain consistent, would support the existence of different knots.
        expected_signals: [Statistically significant variation in absolute neutrino mass (e.g., m_β) between different neutrino sources.]
        pitfalls: [The manifold being so 'flat' in a measurable dimension that variation is below detection thresholds, Confounding systematic errors in absolute mass experiments.]

    excerpt: |
      This led to the Knot Hypothesis: The fundamental parameters (μ_ν,p,q) are not universal constants. Instead, they define a continuous, two-dimensional surface within their three-dimensional parameter space. Any point on this surface represents a valid, self-consistent physical reality. A neutrino is not defined by a single set of parameters, but by a "knot" configuration that lies somewhere on this prime resonance manifold.

    excerpt: |
      Environmental Knot Variation: It is predicted that neutrinos produced in different physical environments (e.g., the core of the Sun, a terrestrial reactor, a supernova) may exist as different knots on the manifold. While their oscillation behavior would be identical, their absolute masses could be subtly different. This could potentially be detected by future experiments capable of measuring the absolute neutrino mass with extreme precision.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The Knot Hypothesis posits a continuous space of valid physical parameters (a manifold) rather than a single fixed point. This is conceptually analogous to the 'landscape' of vacua in string theory or the moduli space of solutions in geometric theories, where physical constants are determined by a position in a higher-dimensional space.

    - statement: "Neutrinos from different production environments (e.g. solar, reactor) can exist as different 'knots', leading to different absolute masses despite identical oscillation behavior."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "High-precision absolute mass measurements from different sources (e.g., KATRIN, Project 8, PTOLEMY) showing no statistically significant variation in m_β, constraining all neutrinos to a single point on the manifold."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from mathematical Knot Theory, which studies the topology of knots in 3D space. While metaphorical, the Pirouette 'knot' refers to a specific, stable point-like configuration on a parameter manifold, not a topological object.
