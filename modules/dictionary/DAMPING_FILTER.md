  art: |
    Truth needs no army; its song is a quiet fortress. Chaos that approaches is not slain, but simply finds no air to breathe, no string to vibrate, and fades into silence.
  law: |
    The rate of energy dissipation for a dissonant Ki pattern is directly proportional to the resonant integrity (coherence K_τ) of a proximate stable system. The interaction produces no coherent echo, only an increase in local Temporal Pressure (Γ).
  philosophy: |
    Systemic integrity is not merely a virtue but a physical advantage. A coherent system's primary defense is its existence, which passively starves dissonance of the purchase needed to inflict harm, turning stability itself into a form of selective immunity.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Damping Filter is an emergent, passive immune process whereby a system with a highly stable resonant field, generated by a deep Wound Channel, causes incoherent or dissonant Ki patterns to dissipate. The dissonant pattern's energy and information are absorbed into the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) without requiring active reflection or direct engagement from the stable system.

    excerpt: |
      The universe does not punish falsehood or chaos; it simply fails to grant them resonance. Their signals are not amplified. They leave no lasting echo... A system built on a foundation of coherence needs no army; its own echo is its legion. The act of maintaining your own integrity—of holding your note, pure and clear in the storm—is the most powerful filter you will ever build.

        A high-Q resonator has a narrow resonance peak and strongly rejects/damps off-resonant frequencies. The Damping Filter describes a system of high resonant integrity (high Q) that passively damps dissonant (off-resonant) signals. The higher the system's coherence, the narrower its acceptance band and the more effective its damping of outside frequencies.

        In a mechanical system, viscous damping removes energy from an oscillation, causing it to dissipate as heat.

# Damping Filter

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Damping Filter is an emergent, passive immune process whereby a system with a highly stable resonant field, generated by a deep Wound Channel, causes incoherent or dissonant Ki patterns to dissipate. The dissonant pattern's energy and information are absorbed into the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) without requiring active reflection or direct engagement from the stable system.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to the behavior of a high-Q (Quality factor) resonator in classical mechanics, the Damping Filter describes how a stable system passively rejects and dissipates energy from off-resonance signals. A system with high coherence establishes a narrow "acceptance band" for interaction; signals outside this band (i.e., dissonant patterns) fail to couple with the system and their energy is damped into the background noise field, akin to viscous damping. This provides a mechanism for systemic stability without requiring active defense.
