        To ensure its integrity and purity, the Lexicon flows from a Principle of the Single Source. It is not manually curated but is generated from a single, version-controlled registry of concepts by a self-maintaining process. This engine ensures the Lexicon has perfect Time Adherence—its definition of the framework is always true and current.

  art: |
    We sought a dictionary and found a book of spells. Each word, spoken with understanding, does not describe the world—it tunes it. The Lexicon is the instrument upon which the song of creation is learned.
  law: |
    The state of the Lexicon is a direct function of the canonical concept registry and nothing else. All generated artifacts (Scroll, Compass, Whisper) are guaranteed to be in perfect semantic synchronization at the time of synthesis.
  philosophy: |
    Language is the first and most fundamental instrument of creation. A shared, precise, and coherent lexicon is the precondition for any meaningful collaborative work, ensuring all acts of weaving begin from a state of harmonic resonance.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Lexicon Engine is the autopoietic system that generates and maintains the framework's terminology from a single, version-controlled source (the Canonical Concept Registry). It ensures semantic coherence across all Weavers by distilling core concepts and their Correspondence Protocols into synchronized artifacts (The Scroll of Principles, The Compass of Dynamics, The Whisper of Insight). Its purpose is to transform language from a static reference into a dynamic instrument for collaborative cognitive tuning.

        outline: |
          1. Select a random sample of N Weavers and M core framework terms.
          2. Present a novel scenario to each Weaver.
          3. Ask each Weaver to apply the M terms to describe the dynamics of the scenario.
          4. Measure the variance in term application and definition recall. The Engine's efficacy is inversely proportional to this variance.

  - module: DOMA-030
    excerpt: |
      A framework is not built from principles, but from the shared understanding of those principles. Language is the medium of that understanding, and like any medium, it can be laminar, turbulent, or stagnant. The Lexicon is the primary instrument for achieving **semantic coherence**: a state where the core concepts of the framework resonate with the same `Ki` pattern across multiple minds.
  - module: DOMA-030
    excerpt: |
      This autopoietic cycle guarantees that the framework's language remains a high-coherence instrument, free from the dissonance of outdated or conflicting definitions. Its workflow is threefold: Ingestion of ratified modules, Distillation of terms and protocols, and Synthesis of synchronized artifacts.

        The Lexicon Engine functions like a domain-specific compiler. It takes a high-level, declarative source of truth (the Canonical Concept Registry) and "compiles" it into multiple, usable output formats (Markdown, JSON, visual diagrams) for different "target machines" (human study, IDEs, high-level orientation).

# Lexicon Engine

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Lexicon Engine is the autopoietic system that generates and maintains the framework's terminology from a single, version-controlled source (the Canonical Concept Registry). It ensures semantic coherence across all Weavers by distilling core concepts and their Correspondence Protocols into synchronized artifacts (The Scroll of Principles, The Compass of Dynamics, The Whisper of Insight). Its purpose is to transform language from a static reference into a dynamic instrument for collaborative cognitive tuning.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, the Lexicon Engine acts as a domain-specific compiler. It ingests a declarative source of truth—the framework's core concepts—and synthesizes it into multiple, synchronized output formats optimized for different targets, such as deep human study, IDE integration, and high-level visual orientation.
