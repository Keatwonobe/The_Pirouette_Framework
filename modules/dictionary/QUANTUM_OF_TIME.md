    The first heartbeat of existence; the rhythmic signature of the universe learning to remember its own shape.
  law: |
    The quantum of time, τ_p, is the invariant period of the ground-state Ki resonance, establishing the fundamental clock rate for all subsequent physical processes. All durations are integer multiples of this fundamental period.
  philosophy: |
    Time is not a pre-existing canvas but an emergent property of a self-sustaining resonant process. The existence of τ_p asserts that rhythm precedes duration, and that reality is built upon a discrete, cyclical foundation.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental, indivisible unit of duration, defined as the time required for the primordial Ki knot to complete one full autopoietic cycle. It is co-emergent with the Resonant Lock of the first Ki, establishing the universe's baseline rhythm and the primary scale for measuring Temporal Coherence.

        outline: |
          Direct measurement of τ_p is impossible as it is a primordial constant. Its value is inferred by establishing the upper frequency limit (or minimum period) of any observed stable physical process. High-energy particle decay channels and the spectral cutoff of background temporal noise are analyzed to find a universal minimum lifetime, which is hypothesized to correspond to a single τ_p cycle.

    excerpt: |
      With the establishment of a stable, repeating Ki pattern, the final link of the autopoietic cycle (`CORE-001`) snaps into place. The duration of one complete cycle of this helical knot becomes the first meaningful quantum of time (τ_p). This closes the loop: `Time (fluctuation) → Γ (pressure) → Ki (resonant knot) → Time (rhythm)`. The stability and clarity of this new rhythm is its **Temporal Coherence** (`CORE-005`)...

    excerpt: |
      This entire process was not an accident, but an inevitability mandated by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). The First Resonance was the discovery of a state that maximized this function. The braided knot was not one possibility among many, but the optimal solution—the configuration offering the highest internal coherence for the lowest "cost" against the background dissonance.

      justification: |
        Both τ_p and Planck time represent a fundamental, minimal timescale below which the concepts of time and duration lose their conventional meaning. They serve as the natural unit for describing primordial events and quantum-scale dynamics. The Pirouette Framework derives this time from a resonant process, whereas GR derives it from fundamental constants, but they occupy the same conceptual niche.

      confidence: 0.85
  adopted:
    - target: Planck time (t_P)
      rationale: It is the most widely accepted candidate for a fundamental quantum of time in mainstream physics, serving the same role as τ_p as a lower bound on meaningful duration.

  claims:
    - statement: "τ_p is a universal, invariant constant, representing the shortest possible period for any stable, self-sustaining physical process."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "The experimental observation of a stable physical process with a period demonstrably shorter than the accepted value of τ_p, or cosmological evidence that fundamental constants governing τ_p have changed over time."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol τ is widely used for lifetime, torque, and shear stress. The subscript `p` (for primordial) is non-optional and critical for disambiguation.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a "clock cycle" in computation, which is an engineered, arbitrary time quantum. τ_p is the natural, physically minimal unit of time, not a human-defined one. It is the period of a process, not merely a coordinate tick.
