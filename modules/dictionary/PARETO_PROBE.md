        The Pareto Probe is that instrument. It re-establishes the analysis not as a study of stabilizing dispersion, but as a hunt for destabilizing concentration. It inverts the common application of the Pareto principle (the 80/20 rule). Instead of finding the 20% of inputs that create 80% of success, this instrument is calibrated to find the **critical few causes responsible for the vast majority of a system's failures**.

    A system in pain is a symphony of noise. The fool tries to quiet every instrument. The master listens for the one string that is out of tune.
  law: |
    For any system experiencing non-terminal coherence loss, a subset of causes comprising no more than 20% of all cause-types will account for at least 80% of the total magnitude of coherence loss (`ΔKτ`) over a representative time interval.
  philosophy: |
    It shifts the focus of systemic intervention from managing diffuse symptoms to surgically correcting the vital few root causes, applying the principle of maximum leverage to restore system health and flow.
pirouette_definition: |
  A diagnostic instrument and four-step protocol that inverts the Pareto principle to identify and rank the critical few causes responsible for the majority (typically 80%) of a system's coherence loss (`ΔKτ`). It operates by correlating discrete system events with a time-series measurement of a system's primary output (coherence) to produce a rank-ordered list of bottlenecks, enabling maximally leveraged interventions.
operational_definition:
  units: The primary output has units of coherence (`Kτ`), which are context-dependent (e.g., tasks/hour, signal fidelity). The final output is a dimensionless, rank-ordered list.

          1.  **Define and Measure `Kτ`**: Identify the system's primary output and collect a time series of its performance.
          2.  **Attribute `ΔKτ`**: Log all discrete internal events and correlate them with negative changes in `Kτ` to create a causal ledger.
          3.  **Rank by Impact**: Sort all event types in descending order by the total `ΔKτ` they have caused.
          4.  **Identify the Vital Few**: Calculate a cumulative sum of the `ΔKτ` down the ranked list. The events above the 80% threshold are the critical bottlenecks.

    excerpt: |
      The Pareto Probe, therefore, is not a mere statistical tool. It is a physical instrument for mapping the landscape of coherence loss. It identifies and ranks the specific events, actors, or processes that are most "expensive" in the Lagrangian's economy, allowing an analyst to see the system not by its average behavior, but by its moments of greatest failure.

    excerpt: |
      The output of the Pareto Probe is not an abstract exponent or a complex map. It is a simple, profoundly actionable list. This output gives the Weaver a precise target... It guides the "Daedalus Gambit" (DYNA-003) to the point of maximum leverage.

        The Pareto Probe is a direct, albeit inverted, application of classical Pareto analysis used in quality control. While standard use identifies the most frequent causes of success (or defects), the Probe specifically measures the *magnitude of impact* of failure modes on a system's core output, framing it in terms of coherence loss.

  disambiguation: |
    Standard Pareto analysis often identifies the 20% of inputs that generate 80% of positive outcomes. The Pareto Probe is its inverse: it is a diagnostic tool calibrated specifically to find the 20% of failure modes or bottlenecks that cause 80% of *negative* outcomes (coherence loss). It is a tool for finding the source of pain, not the source of gain.

# Pareto Probe

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A diagnostic instrument and four-step protocol that inverts the Pareto principle to identify and rank the critical few causes responsible for the majority (typically 80%) of a system's coherence loss (`ΔKτ`). It operates by correlating discrete system events with a time-series measurement of a system's primary output (coherence) to produce a rank-ordered list of bottlenecks, enabling maximally leveraged interventions.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pareto Probe is an operational protocol analogous to **Pareto Analysis** in classical quality management. While standard Pareto charts often rank defect frequencies, the Probe ranks distinct failure modes by the magnitude of their negative impact on a primary system observable (`Kτ`, or coherence). This method is designed to identify the "critical few" bottlenecks—points of high friction or turbulence—that are responsible for the vast majority of a system's performance degradation, allowing for targeted, high-leverage intervention.
