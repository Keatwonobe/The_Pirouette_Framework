        Ambient Pressure (`Œì`): Identify the external and internal pressures that shape and constrain this life. What are the primary sources of stress, anxiety, obligation, and fear?

  art: |
    The invisible hand that guides the river of a life, felt not as a touch but as the steepness of the banks and the pull of the undertow. It is the gravity of circumstance.
  law: |
    The geodesic of a life path will preferentially follow contours of lower Ambient Pressure, unless overcome by a sufficiently strong gradient in Personal Coherence (`K_œÑ`). All change incurs a `Œì`-cost.
  philosophy: |
    To map Ambient Pressure is to externalize constraint, transforming personal struggle into a solvable problem of navigation and environmental engineering. It re-frames fear and obligation not as character flaws, but as data points defining the terrain.
pirouette_definition: |
  A scalar field on the Personal Coherence Manifold representing the aggregate potential energy cost (`V_Œì`) of a given state, trajectory, or action. Ambient Pressure is sourced from the full spectrum of internal and external constraints, including social obligations, financial stress, physical limitations, fear, trauma, and self-doubt. It is the quantitative measure of the forces that resist change and constrain the available paths for a system.

      - name: Pressure Inventory
        outline: |
          1.  **Inventory External Pressures**: List all significant sources of external obligation, dependency, and constraint (e.g., job requirements, financial debts, family care duties).
          2.  **Inventory Internal Pressures**: List all significant internal sources of fear, anxiety, self-doubt, and avoidance (e.g., imposter syndrome, fear of failure, echoes of past trauma).
          3.  **Quantify & Map**: Assign a subjective salience score (e.g., 1-10) to each item. Map these pressures to specific life domains (work, relationships, health) to identify high-pressure zones on the personal manifold.
        expected_signals: [Somatic tension, cognitive load, decision paralysis, avoidance behaviors]
        pitfalls: [Normalizing chronic stress to a baseline of zero, confusing high pressure (`Œì`) with low coherence (`K_œÑ`), attributing systemic pressure to personal failing]

    excerpt: |
      First, establish a baseline by mapping the river you are in. This defines your "you are here" on the personal map. Current Coherence (`KœÑ`): Identify the stable, resonant patterns of your life. What activities, relationships, and states of being generate flow, joy, and purpose? Ambient Pressure (`Œì`): Identify the external and internal pressures that shape and constrain this life. What are the primary sources of stress, anxiety,obligation, and fear?
  - module: DOMA-166
    excerpt: |
      A Resonance Bridge is a strategic, incremental change to one's `Ki` pattern. It is a calculated act of becoming, designed to shift the life-geodesic towards this more optimal state by managing the "cost" (`V_Œì`) of the transition‚Äîthe fear, uncertainty, and effort required to change.

  candidates:
    - target: Potential Energy (V)
      domain: CM
      mapping_kind: mathematical
      equation_hint: |
        ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì
      justification: |
        Ambient Pressure (`Œì`) directly informs a potential energy term (`V_Œì`) in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`). This term functions identically to potential energy in classical mechanics, creating a generalized "force" (`-‚àáV_Œì`) that drives the system toward states of lower pressure, representing the path of least resistance.

      rationale: The mapping is explicitly defined and functionally core to the Pirouette Lagrangian formalism in DOMA-166 and CORE-006.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Increases in Ambient Pressure (`Œì`) demonstrably constrain the set of viable life paths, measurable as a reduction in exploratory behaviors or novel `Ki` patterns."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If a subject under verifiably high external and internal stress (`Œì`) shows a spontaneous and sustained *increase* in exploratory, high-risk, or novel behaviors without a corresponding narrative of 'desperation' or 'escape', the model of `Œì` as a simple constraining potential is incomplete."
      status: proposed

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol `Œì` is heavily overloaded in physics and mathematics (Gamma function, Christoffel symbols, Lorentz factor). Context is critical.]
  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, `Œì` is always a scalar field representing psycho-social potential, not a kinematic factor or geometric connection. It describes the "heaviness" of the landscape, not the properties of the path or the observer.
