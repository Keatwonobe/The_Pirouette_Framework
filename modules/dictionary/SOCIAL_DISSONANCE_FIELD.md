  art: |
    The invisible static crackling in the social fabric, a map of all handshakes not taken and words that flow in circles instead of connecting. It is the geometry of frustrated potential.
  law: |
    The magnitude of social dissonance, |**D**|, decays as the inverse of the distance (r⁻¹) from a social system's coherence core (for r > r_c), forming a "dissonant halo" of systemic inefficiency.
  philosophy: |
    To measure social dissonance is to render the abstract forces of alienation, polarization, and inefficiency as a tangible geometry, making societal health a problem of engineering rather than just critique.
pirouette_definition: |
  A vector field **D**(x,t) that quantifies the misalignment between the observed flow of social interactions (**J**_obs) and an idealized, coherence-optimal flow (**J**_opt) derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian. **D** is constructed via the Hodge decomposition of the residual flow (**r** = **J**_obs - **J**_opt), isolating the irrotational (cooperative deficit, ∇φ) and solenoidal (antagonistic circulation, ∇×**A**) components of social inefficiency.

  units: Context-dependent; same as the underlying social flow (e.g., `transactions·s⁻¹`, `information_bits·link⁻¹·s⁻¹`) or dimensionless if flows are normalized.

          1. Construct a weighted, directed graph of social interactions (nodes, edges, weights).
          2. Compute the idealized coherence-optimal flow (**J**_opt) by minimizing entropy production or maximizing the system's Lagrangian under constraints.
          3. Calculate the residual flow vector field **r** = **J**_obs - **J**_opt on the graph's edges.
          4. Apply discrete Hodge decomposition to **r** to isolate the gradient (∇φ), curl (∇×**A**), and harmonic (**h**) components. The dissonance field is **D** = ∇φ + ∇×**A**.

      The Social Dissonance Field (\mathbf{D}) quantifies the misalignment between the observed flow of interactions and the idealized coherence flow predicted by the Pirouette Lagrangian... (\mathbf{D}) measures the difference between the real and idealized fluxes: [\mathbf{D} = \nabla \phi + \nabla \times \mathbf{A}] where (\phi) captures unbalanced cooperative potential (gradient term), and (\mathbf{A}) captures antagonistic or circulatory motion (curl term).
  - module: SOCIO-FIELD-001
    excerpt: |
      Social systems self-organize into coherence halos analogous to cosmological (\Gamma)-halos. The prediction is that (|\mathbf{D}| \sim r^{-1}) outside a coherence core radius (r_c), and that curl magnitude exceeds a threshold (\Theta) prior to systemic cascade events. This "Halo Test" is a primary empirical validation of the theory.

        The field **D** measures a system's response to an underlying ideal, much as the electric displacement field accounts for a dielectric's polarization in response to an external electric field **E**. The Hodge decomposition separates sources (divergence from φ) from circulations (curl from **A**), analogous to Helmholtz decomposition in EM. The r⁻¹ scaling further suggests a field sourced by charge-like deficits.

    In Pirouette, **D** always refers to a *social* dissonance field derived from a residual flow on a graph, not a field in physical spacetime or a scalar coefficient. The context of social networks, residual flows, and Hodge decomposition distinguishes it from its physics counterparts.

# Social Dissonance Field

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A vector field **D**(x,t) that quantifies the misalignment between the observed flow of social interactions (**J**_obs) and an idealized, coherence-optimal flow (**J**_opt) derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian. **D** is constructed via the Hodge decomposition of the residual flow (**r** = **J**_obs - **J**_opt), isolating the irrotational (cooperative deficit, ∇φ) and solenoidal (antagonistic circulation, ∇×**A**) components of social inefficiency.

## EFT-First Summary
The Social Dissonance Field **D** is the social analogue to the electric displacement field in a dielectric medium. Just as **D** in electromagnetism accounts for the polarization (bound charges) of a material in response to an external field, the Social Dissonance Field quantifies the misaligned or 'bound' flows of social capital and information in response to idealized pressures for coherence. Its divergence sources correspond to 'charges' of cooperative deficit, while its curl components represent stable, inefficient circulatory patterns, like eddies in a fluid.
