        A3 Coherence network: mass/energy flows along a D_eff‑dimensional subset of space (sheets/filaments/points), a coarse‑grained representation of “wound channels.”

  art: |
    The universe's active nervous system, a web of filaments and sheets where reality flows and structures form. It is the unseen skeleton defining the shape of cosmic life, a geometry of coherence etched into spacetime.
  law: |
    The network's effective dimension, D_eff, dictates the Pressuron equation of state exponent β via the scaling law β = D_eff / z. For non-relativistic superfluids (z=2), D_eff stabilizes on integer plateaus {0,1,2}, fixing β to the rational set {0, 1/2, 1} and making dynamics a direct consequence of geometry.
  philosophy: |
    This concept grounds abstract dynamics in tangible geometry, replacing a free parameter (β) with a discrete, structural choice (D_eff). It asserts that not all of space is dynamically equal; the system's evolution is governed by a lower-dimensional, topologically significant substrate where coherence is concentrated.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence Network is the effective, lower-dimensional subset of spacetime (D_eff-dimensional) along which mass, energy, and phase information preferentially flow. It represents the coarse-grained structure of "wound channels" in the superfluid medium. The network's geometry, characterized by its effective dimension D_eff, directly determines the Pressuron equation of state exponent β via scaling symmetry, thereby fixing the system's macroscopic dynamics without data-fitting.

        outline: |
          Measure the Pressuron scaling exponent β from astrophysical observables like halo core surface density (Σ₀) vs. mass or the small-scale matter power spectrum. Given an established dynamical exponent z for the epoch (e.g., z=2 for non-relativistic superfluid halos), compute the network dimension as D_eff = β * z. The result is predicted to be an integer or near-integer.

    excerpt: |
      β = D_eff / z where D_eff is the effective (possibly fractal) spatial dimension of the active coherence network (wound channels) and z is the dynamical exponent of the superfluid sector. In 3D spacetime with nonrelativistic superfluid scaling z=2 and plateaus D_eff∈{0,1,2}, one obtains β∈{0, 1/2, 1}—exactly the rational set allowed in SECT‑Γ‑A. No calibration needed.

      justification: |
        In condensed matter, interactions or confinement can restrict particle movement to lower-dimensional manifolds (e.g., quantum wires, 2D electron gases), which alters macroscopic properties. The Coherence Network is a cosmological analogue where the superfluid's dynamical activity is confined to a geometric subset of bulk space, with D_eff quantifying this confinement.

      justification: |
        The Coherence Network provides a dynamical origin for the observed cosmic web. Its D_eff=1 (filament) and D_eff=2 (sheet) regimes are proposed to be the underlying superfluid structures that seed the large-scale filaments and walls of the galaxy distribution.

  claims:
    - statement: "The network's effective dimension D_eff organizes into discrete plateaus {0, 1, 2} on cosmological scales, restricting the Pressuron exponent β to {0, 1/2, 1} for systems with dynamical exponent z=2."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Robust measurement of β from a large sample of galaxy halos consistently yields a value outside this rational set (e.g., β ≈ 0.75) without evidence of being in a transitional regime."
      status: proposed
      links: ['MATH-022']
    - statement: "The network's discrete scale invariance (DSI) imprints small, log-periodic oscillations on top of power-law scaling relations, such as the core surface density vs. halo mass (Σ₀ vs. M)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "High-precision analysis of halo scaling relations reveals a pure, unbroken power law, with residuals being consistent with Gaussian noise and showing no periodic structure in log-space."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the 'cosmic web,' which is an observational description of the large-scale matter distribution. The Coherence Network is the underlying dynamical cause within the Pirouette Framework—a substrate for superfluid flow that dictates where structures like the cosmic web can form.
