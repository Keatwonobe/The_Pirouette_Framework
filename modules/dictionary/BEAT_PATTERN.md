    When quarks hum together inside a hadron, their shared rhythm cancels the loudest parts of the song. Only a faint overtone—the Γ whisper—escapes, proof that even the quietest beats belong to the same cosmic percussion.
  law: |
    The effective coupling of the Γ-field to a baryon is suppressed by a factor η_B, which is determined by the coherence gradient of the interference pattern between its constituent quarks' temporal phases. This suppression factor directly predicts the magnitude of the Γ-mediated correction to the baryon's magnetic moment anomaly, Δa_B.
  philosophy: |
    The Beat Pattern provides the conceptual bridge between the fundamental Γ-field coupling at the quark level and the observed, highly suppressed interaction at the baryonic scale. It explains why composite particles are "quiet" in the Γ-field, transforming a problem of fine-tuning into a predictable consequence of QCD coherence and confinement.
pirouette_definition: |
  The physical manifestation of a Γ-field excitation within a composite fermion (e.g., a baryon), arising from the quantum interference of the temporal phase oscillations of its constituent quarks. The coherence of this spacetime pattern dictates the effective coupling strength, η_B, which quantifies the suppression of the interaction due to gluon-mediated screening and phase cancellation.

        outline: |
          1. Perform an ultra-high-precision measurement of a baryon's (e.g., proton's) magnetic moment anomaly, `a_B`, aiming for a sensitivity of 1 part in 10¹⁰ or better.
          2. Calculate the complete Standard Model (QED+QCD) prediction for `a_B` to equivalent precision.
          3. A residual discrepancy, `δa_B = a_B(exp) - a_B(SM)`, is a candidate signal for the Pirouette correction, `Δa_B`.
          4. Infer `η_B` from the relation `η_B = δa_B / [(g_Γ²/8π²) * (M_B/m_Γ)²]`.
        expected_signals: [A residual anomaly `Δa_p ~ 10⁻¹⁰` for the proton, `Δa_n ~ 10⁻¹¹` for the neutron.]
        pitfalls: [Theoretical uncertainties in the SM calculation may be larger than the signal, other new physics could contribute to the anomaly.]

    excerpt: |
      Inside a baryon, Γ excitation manifests as a **beat pattern** between quark temporal phases. The coherence gradient of these beats defines η_B. When baryons interact coherently (as in dense matter), Γ coupling enhances proportionally to local phase alignment, providing a natural link to nuclear binding corrections.
  - module: MATH-Γ-003
    excerpt: |
      The coupling is **screened** by gluon coherence, giving an effective reduction factor η_B ≪ 1. Integrating out quark loops inside a baryon of mass M_B yields a small additive term to its magnetic anomaly, where η_B encapsulates QCD shielding and coherence damping.

        The Beat Pattern is a quantum field theoretic analog of classical wave interference. Just as two waves with slightly different frequencies produce a beat, the differing temporal phases of confined quarks interfere to create a modulation pattern. The coherence of this pattern determines the effective coupling strength, analogous to how the amplitude of a classical beat depends on the phase relationship of its sources.

  disambiguation: |
    This term refers specifically to the quantum interference of quark temporal phases within a confined system (a hadron), not a classical wave phenomenon. The "pattern" is an effective, spacetime-dependent modulation of the Γ-coupling strength *inside* the particle, which is integrated over to yield a single suppression factor, η_B.

# Beat Pattern

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The physical manifestation of a Γ-field excitation within a composite fermion (e.g., a baryon), arising from the quantum interference of the temporal phase oscillations of its constituent quarks. The coherence of this spacetime pattern dictates the effective coupling strength, η_B, which quantifies the suppression of the interaction due to gluon-mediated screening and phase cancellation.

## EFT-First Summary
In analogy to classical wave physics, the Beat Pattern describes the interference of constituent quark temporal phases within a baryon. This quantum beat phenomenon results in a coherent suppression of the effective coupling to the Γ-field, encapsulated by the dimensionless factor `η_B`. Its primary physical consequence is a predicted small correction to the baryon's magnetic moment anomaly, currently below experimental limits but potentially detectable with future precision measurements.
