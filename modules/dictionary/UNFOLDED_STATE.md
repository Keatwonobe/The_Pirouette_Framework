        The Unfolded State (Resonant Coherence): The system can find a state of higher net coherence (ùìõ_p) by simplifying its spatial form to a 2-fold pattern and expressing the remaining complexity as a rhythm. The new state has a simpler spatial Ki but now possesses a stable, coherent resonant frequency (œâ_k).

    A silent, complex sculpture melts into a simple, resonant melody. The form is not lost but is reborn as a living rhythm, its memory becoming a beat.
  law: |
    A system in a low Temporal Pressure (Œì) environment will transition from a complex static spatial symmetry to a simpler dynamic oscillation if and only if doing so increases its net Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p).
  philosophy: |
    An Unfolded State demonstrates that a system's identity is not fixed in its form but can be re-encoded into its dynamic behavior. It represents a fundamental trade-off: sacrificing static spatial complexity for dynamic temporal coherence, turning structure into song.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Unfolded State is the dynamically stable ground state a system achieves after undergoing dimensional unfolding. It is characterized by a simplified spatial geometry (typically 2-fold or bipolar) and a coherent, high-purity temporal oscillation (œâ‚Çñ) whose properties encode the information from the 'unfolded' spatial dimension. This state maximizes the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) in low Temporal Pressure (Œì) environments by minimizing the cost of coherence (V_Œì).

          3. Monitor for a spontaneous reconfiguration from a static multi-polar geometry to a dynamic bipolar oscillation.

      The core insight... is that the emergent oscillation is not merely a carrier of encoded information; the new rhythm *is* the information. The system's identity fundamentally shifts from its shape to its song. This new identity is defined by the rich characteristics of its resonance: Frequency (œâ_k), Amplitude, and Temporal Coherence (T_a). A successful unfolding results in a state of very high T_a‚Äîa clear, unwavering note.

        Rayleigh-B√©nard convection is a phase transition where a spatially symmetric, static system (a uniform fluid layer) spontaneously develops a simpler but dynamic pattern (convection rolls) when a thermodynamic drive surpasses a threshold. Both processes trade static homogeneity for dynamic, patterned coherence under specific environmental conditions. The Unfolded State is driven by low Temporal Pressure, while convection is driven by a high temperature gradient.

    Distinguish from 'decay' or 'dissipation'. The Unfolded State is a stable, coherent ground state, not a chaotic breakdown. Its defining feature is a pure, high-adherence rhythm, not a broad spectrum of noise.

# Unfolded State

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Unfolded State is the dynamically stable ground state a system achieves after undergoing dimensional unfolding. It is characterized by a simplified spatial geometry (typically 2-fold or bipolar) and a coherent, high-purity temporal oscillation (œâ‚Çñ) whose properties encode the information from the 'unfolded' spatial dimension. This state maximizes the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) in low Temporal Pressure (Œì) environments by minimizing the cost of coherence (V_Œì).

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to pattern formation in classical systems like Rayleigh-B√©nard convection, the Unfolded State represents a phase transition to a dynamic, ordered state. A system under low external pressure (analogous to a low thermodynamic drive) trades a complex but static spatial configuration for a simpler, oscillating pattern, maximizing its internal coherence.
