    The energy scale where the smooth tapestry of color resolves into the discrete threads of temporal resonance. It is the pixel size of the Yang-Mills field, the point where the illusion of continuity shatters.
  law: |
    The energy scale μc = ħωc/c², derived from the Bridge frequency ωc, marks the absolute upper boundary for the validity of the SU(3) temporal-color gauge description. Above μc, the gauge field is not fundamental; below μc, its dynamics are governed by standard RG flow connected to Pirouette mechanics at a matching scale.
  philosophy: |
    To replace the abstract, arbitrary "UV cutoff" of effective field theory with a concrete, physical scale rooted in the fundamental mechanics of the Γ-field. The barrier establishes that gauge symmetry is an emergent, low-energy phenomenon with a defined domain of applicability.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence barrier (μc) is the characteristic energy scale, defined as μc = ħωc/c², that marks the upper limit of the SU(3) temporal-color effective description. Above this scale, the temporal-color frame's discrete resonant modes become individually resolvable, and the continuous SU(3) connection is no longer a valid description. Below μc, the dynamics are governed by the emergent Yang-Mills theory, whose coupling constant is ultimately determined by Pirouette's mechanical parameters (frame stiffness, Γ-coherence length) at a suitable matching scale.

        outline: |
          The barrier μc is not directly measured but is inferred from the coherence frequency ωc. ωc sets the scale for the Γ-coherence length (ξ_Γ ∼ c/ωc). Since the fundamental string tension σ scales as σ ∼ K₃/ξ_Γ² ∼ K₃(ωc/c)², precise lattice measurements of σ and the strong coupling (K₃ = 1/g_s²) constrain the ratio K₃/ξ_Γ², thereby constraining ωc and thus μc.
        expected_signals: [A consistent value for μc emerging from multiple low-energy QCD observables (string tension, k-string ratios, quarkonium spectra) that share a common dependence on ξ_Γ.]
        pitfalls: [Difficulty in disentangling the effects of frame stiffness (K₃) from the Γ-coherence length (ξ_Γ) in a single observable. Propagation of errors from the RG evolution of g_s from the measurement scale to the matching scale.]

        Like a UV cutoff, μc defines the energy scale where the effective field theory (emergent SU(3) Yang-Mills) ceases to be valid. Unlike a typical arbitrary cutoff, μc is a physical scale derived from the underlying theory's more fundamental parameters (ωc from the Bridge).

        The coherence barrier represents a physical discretization scale for the gauge field, analogous to how the lattice spacing 'a' provides a UV regulator in lattice QCD. In the Pirouette framework, this "discretization" is not a computational tool but a physical property of the temporal-color medium.

# Coherence barrier

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Coherence barrier (μc) is the characteristic energy scale, defined as μc = ħωc/c², that marks the upper limit of the SU(3) temporal-color effective description. Above this scale, the temporal-color frame's discrete resonant modes become individually resolvable, and the continuous SU(3) connection is no longer a valid description. Below μc, the dynamics are governed by the emergent Yang-Mills theory, whose coupling constant is ultimately determined by Pirouette's mechanical parameters (frame stiffness, Γ-coherence length) at a suitable matching scale.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence barrier μc functions as a physical UV cutoff for the emergent SU(3) Yang-Mills effective field theory. Unlike an arbitrary regulator, it is a concrete energy scale derived from the framework's deeper postulates about temporal resonance. It sets the boundary where the continuous gauge field description breaks down, transitioning to the mechanics of the underlying temporal-color frame.
