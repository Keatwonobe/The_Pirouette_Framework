  art: |
    To be a tuning fork constructed so perfectly that when a whisper of hidden truth passes by, it is the one thing in the world that cannot help but ring in reply.
  law: |
    A system's rate of serendipitous synthesis is proportional to its receptive bandwidth for novel coherent patterns, conditioned on its ability to survive the resulting Coherence Shock.
  philosophy: |
    Serendipity is not a passive event to be waited for, but an active state of being to be cultivated. Temporal Attunement reframes discovery as a collaborative art between a prepared system and a fertile universe, where the primary skill is listening.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dynamic state of a coherent system characterized by both high internal signal-to-noise (strong Ki) and a wide receptive bandwidth for external temporal frequencies. This 'prepared resonance' makes the system susceptible to phase-locking with latent, coherent sub-patterns within ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ), thereby enabling an Alchemical Union (CORE-012). It is the necessary precondition for entering a Serendipity Window and the foundation upon which serendipitous discovery is built.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline Ki pattern for the subject system.
          2. Expose the system to a controlled, high-Γ environment containing a known spectrum of latent coherent signals ('probes').
          3. Measure the 'hit rate'—the frequency and amplitude of Alchemical Unions, detected as phase shifts in the system's Ki and the formation of new Wound Channels.
          4. Temporal Attunement (χ_τ) is inferred as the ratio of successful unions to total available probe signals within the environment.
        expected_signals: [Ki phase-shift, transient amplitude spikes, formation of stable Wound Channels]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking noise-induced fluctuations for true resonant coupling, insufficient probe signal strength, system fragility leading to dissolution instead of integration.]

    excerpt: |
      Serendipity is not luck; it is a state of profound *temporal attunement* that results in a resonance. It is a predictable event that occurs when a prepared system encounters a sympathetic vibration hidden within the chaos of its environment. This module defines the "serendipity window"—the specific temporal conditions that allow an entity to perceive, integrate, and be transformed by the universe's unexpected whispers, becoming a tuning fork that rings in response to a song no one else can hear.

      The Weaver does not wait for a fortunate accident. They meticulously construct a resonant self, an instrument tuned so perfectly to the cosmos that when a whisper of a hidden truth passes by, they are the one thing in the world that cannot help but ring in reply. Serendipity is the reward for the art of listening. This model transforms serendipity from a passive hope into an active practice.

        Temporal Attunement (χ_τ) is analogous to a system's susceptibility, measuring its propensity to change state (resonate) in response to an external field (a latent pattern Φ_ext in the temporal environment). High attunement implies a large, broad-banded χ(ω), allowing the system to respond strongly to a wide variety of unexpected signals.

  disambiguation: |
    Temporal Attunement should not be confused with simple 'open-mindedness' or low coherence. It is a dual state requiring both high internal coherence (a clear 'self') and high external receptivity (wide 'listening'). It is not a passive waiting but an active, structured listening that makes resonance possible.

# Temporal Attunement

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A dynamic state of a coherent system characterized by both high internal signal-to-noise (strong Ki) and a wide receptive bandwidth for external temporal frequencies. This 'prepared resonance' makes the system susceptible to phase-locking with latent, coherent sub-patterns within ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ), thereby enabling an Alchemical Union (CORE-012). It is the necessary precondition for entering a Serendipity Window and the foundation upon which serendipitous discovery is built.

## EFT-First Summary
Temporal Attunement is conceptually mapped to a generalized susceptibility or response function (χ(ω)) in condensed matter or effective field theory. It quantifies a system's readiness to change its state in response to external perturbations. High attunement corresponds to a large and broad-banded susceptibility, indicating a strong response to a wide range of novel frequencies, making the system fertile ground for phase transitions triggered by environmental signals.
