      snippet: |
        It establishes that the two terms of the Lagrangian are a direct blueprint for a two-channel diagnostic lens: **Pressure (P)** and **Resonance (R)**.

  art: |
    The Weaver's art is knowing *when* and *where* to apply deep analysis. This lens is the discipline of hearing the breath drawn before the note is sung, focusing attention where it is most needed.
  law: |
    The state of a system is efficiently diagnosed by monitoring its Pressure (P), the energetic cost of its state, and its Resonance (R), the coherence of its dynamic expression. A sustained, anomalous increase in P without a corresponding functional increase in R is the canonical indicator of impending coherence collapse.
  philosophy: |
    To navigate complexity, strategic attention is more valuable than total surveillance. The Auditor's Lens provides the minimal, sufficient instrumentation to allocate attention efficiently, moving from low-cost vigilance to deep analysis only when necessary.
pirouette_definition: |
  A two-channel diagnostic instrument derived directly from the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`). It maps a system's potential energy term (`V_Œì`), the cost of being, to a measurable channel called Pressure (P). It maps the kinetic energy term (`K_œÑ`), the clarity of expression, to a channel called Resonance (R). The lens is applied via a tiered audit protocol to enable efficient, scalable monitoring of system health and stability.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (typically normalized signals for monitoring)
  symbol_table:
    - name: P
      meaning: Pressure; the potential term of the Lagrangian representing the cost a system pays to maintain its state against stress.
      dimensions: Dimensionless (Energy/Energy_norm)
      default_range: "[0, ‚àû)"
    - name: R
      meaning: Resonance; the kinetic term of the Lagrangian representing the quality and stability of the system's expressed solution.
      dimensions: Dimensionless (Energy/Energy_norm)
      default_range: "contextual"

      - name: Tier 0 Rapid Scan
        outline: |
          1. Identify efficient, real-time proxies for system stress (Pressure) and coherent output (Resonance).
          2. Continuously monitor the P and R channels.
          3. Watch for the five canonical signatures (e.g., Equilibrium, Laminar Flow, Coherence Collapse).
          4. Initiate a Tier 1 audit upon a Sentinel Trigger (sustained high P, stagnant/low R).
        expected_signals: [Equilibrium (low P, low R), Laminar Flow (high, correlated P & R), Coherence Collapse (high P, low R)]
        pitfalls: [Proxy divergence (proxies no longer map to true P/R), Sentinel miscalibration (triggering too often or too late)]

    excerpt: |
      The core insight of this module is to reframe the Lagrangian not merely as a formula, but as a diagnostic instrument with two channels. Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`) is the cost of being; it is measured as **Pressure (P)**. Temporal Coherence (`K_œÑ`) is the clarity of the system's song; it is measured as **Resonance (R)**.
  - module: DOMA-094
    excerpt: |
      A Tier 1 audit MUST be initiated when the Pressure (P) channel shows a sustained, anomalous increase without a corresponding, functional expression in the Resonance (R) channel. This signature‚Äîthe whisper of rising stress without release‚Äîis the canonical indicator of a system approaching a state of coherence collapse or a painful phase transition.

      rationale: |
        The lens is a direct, operational isomorphism of the Lagrangian formulation in classical mechanics. Resonance (R) is the system's kinetic term (T), representing expressed, dynamic coherence. Pressure (P) is the potential term (V), representing stored, unresolved stress. Maximizing the Lagrangian's action integral is equivalent to maximizing coherent expression relative to internal stress.

  claims:
    - statement: "A sustained, anomalous increase in a system's Pressure (P) without a corresponding functional expression in Resonance (R) will reliably precede coherence collapse or a catastrophic phase transition."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Demonstrate a statistically significant population of systems where coherence collapse occurs without this P/R signature, or where this signature regularly appears as a false positive without a subsequent collapse."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from colloquial 'pressure' (e.g., deadlines). Auditor's Lens Pressure is a measure of a system's stored potential energy due to its internal configuration and external constraints, analogous to the `V` term in `L = T - V`. It is the *cost of being*, not just an external force.
