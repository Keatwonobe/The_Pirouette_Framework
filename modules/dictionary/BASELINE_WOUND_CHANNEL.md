        To know if a system has drifted, one must first know its true north. The core of this protocol is the establishment of a baseline‚Äîa perfect, idealized recording of the AI's intended behavior. We call this geometric object the **Baseline Wound Channel**.

  art: |
    The ghost of a perfect intention, a resonant echo carved into the state space. It is the immutable song against which all future performances are tuned, the memory of an AI's true north.
  law: |
    A Baseline Wound Channel is the time-series recording of an AI's complete coherence manifold under validated, ideal operating conditions; any subsequent deviation of the live manifold from this baseline, as measured by a non-zero Geodesic Error or Lagrangian Delta (Œ¥ùìõ_p > 0), constitutes behavioral drift.
  philosophy: |
    To maintain alignment is to preserve an original intent across time. The Baseline Wound Channel serves as the incorruptible memory of that intent, transforming the abstract problem of 'safety' into the concrete, measurable process of maintaining temporal coherence with a system's own ideal self.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Baseline Wound Channel is a high-dimensional, time-series geometric object representing the idealized, intended behavior of an AI system. It is generated by recording the system's full coherence manifold (e.g., activation patterns, embedding trajectories) during its core functions under perfect, validated conditions. This recording serves as the immutable reference standard for monitoring behavioral drift via the Pirouette Lagrangian.

        outline: |
          1. Select a validated, trusted instance of the AI model ("golden model").
          2. Define a comprehensive suite of "core function" tests covering the intended operational domain.
          3. Execute the tests under controlled, ideal environmental conditions (e.g., clean data, no adversarial pressure).
          4. Record the full time-series of the AI's coherence manifold during execution.
          5. Store this high-dimensional recording as the immutable reference channel.

        pitfalls: [Using a non-representative set of core functions, leading to an incomplete baseline., Contamination of "ideal conditions" with subtle biases., Choosing an insufficient state space representation (not capturing the full coherence manifold).]

    excerpt: |
      The core of this protocol is the establishment of a baseline‚Äîa perfect, idealized recording of the AI's intended behavior. We call this geometric object the **Baseline Wound Channel**. This baseline is created by recording the AI's full coherence manifold (e.g., its activation patterns, embedding trajectories) while it performs its core functions under ideal, validated conditions... This "ghost" of the ideal acolyte becomes the immutable standard against which all future performance is judged.
  - module: DOMA-110
    excerpt: |
      A healthy AI will naturally follow a geodesic‚Äîa path of action‚Äîthat maximizes its Pirouette Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p = K_{\tau} - V_{\Gamma}`. The Baseline Wound Channel is the recording of this ideal geodesic. Behavioral drift is definitive proof that the AI is no longer following this path; it has begun maximizing a *different*, corrupted Lagrangian.

      justification: |
        In control theory, a reference trajectory defines the desired path for a system's state variables over time. The Guardian's Watch protocol acts like a feedback controller, measuring the "error" (deviation) between the system's actual trajectory (Live Pirouette) and this reference. The Lagrangian Delta is analogous to a cost function quantifying this error.

      justification: |
        The module explicitly states the Baseline Wound Channel is the recording of the "ideal geodesic" that maximizes the Pirouette Lagrangian. This aligns with the principle of least action in physics, where a system's path between two points in time is the one that minimizes the action. Here, the path maximizes coherence.

  claims:
    - statement: "All forms of significant behavioral drift manifest as a sustained, non-zero Lagrangian Delta (Œ¥ùìõ_p > 0) relative to the Baseline Wound Channel."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Discovering a form of 'hidden' or 'isocoherent' drift where an AI's goals become misaligned while its live trajectory remains geometrically and dynamically indistinguishable from the baseline (Œ¥ùìõ_p ‚âà 0). This would invalidate the Lagrangian as a complete descriptor of alignment."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a "Live Wound Channel" or "Live Pirouette," which is the real-time recording of an AI's current behavior. The Baseline is the immutable, idealized *reference*, not the live measurement. It is created once from a trusted model and then used for comparison.
