        Narrative Refactoring: The narrative is not sacred. As new evidence emerges, it must be ruthlessly refactored or abandoned. The version history of the narrative itself tells the story of our journey toward understanding.

    The story is a map, not the territory. When the terrain proves the map wrong, the artist's duty is not to defend the map, but to redraw it with a wiser hand.
  law: |
    A Daedalus Gambit narrative (N) is considered invalid and must undergo refactoring (ℜ(N)) if new, validated evidence (ε) increases the Dissonance Ledger's size or introduces a contradiction that cannot be resolved by the current persona.
  philosophy: |
    To prevent the powerful tool of narrative from becoming a blinding dogma. Narrative Refactoring enshrines scientific humility, ensuring that the persona remains a servant to the evidence, not its master.
pirouette_definition: |
  The mandatory, auditable process within The Daedalus Gambit (`DOMA-097`) of modifying or discarding a pathological `Coherence Narrative` and its associated persona when confronted with new, falsifying evidence. This disciplined act of model updating is governed by the `Dissonance Ledger` and is essential for maintaining the scientific integrity of the investigation, ensuring the narrative remains a tool for discovery rather than a source of confirmation bias.

        outline: |
          1. Maintain a version-controlled `Coherence Narrative` (e.g., v1.0, v1.1).
          2. For each new piece of evidence (ε), evaluate its consistency with the current narrative.
          3. If ε contradicts the narrative or expands the `Dissonance Ledger` (ΔD_L > 0), trigger a refactoring event.
          4. The refactored narrative (e.g., v2.0) must incorporate ε and aim to reduce the Dissonance Ledger (ΔD_L ≤ 0).
          5. The commit log for the narrative serves as the measurement record.

    excerpt: |
      To ensure the Gambit remains a tool of science and not speculation, the following guardrails are mandatory. ... Narrative Refactoring: The narrative is not sacred. As new evidence emerges, it must be ruthlessly refactored or abandoned. The version history of the narrative itself tells the story of our journey toward understanding.
  - module: DOMA-097
    excerpt: |
      The elegance of a persona must never overshadow its primary function: to generate falsifiable predictions. A story that explains everything but predicts nothing is a failure of the protocol.

  candidates:
    - target: Bayesian model updating
      domain: Math
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      equation_hint: |
        P(M|D) ∝ P(D|M) P(M)
      justification: |
        Narrative Refactoring is the operationalization of updating a model (M, the narrative persona) in light of new data (D, the evidence). A narrative is "abandoned" when its posterior probability, P(M|D), becomes negligible compared to a new, alternative narrative. The process seeks to maximize the model evidence.

      confidence: 0.8
  adopted:
    - target: Bayesian model updating
      rationale: The mapping is conceptually exact. The `Coherence Narrative` acts as a prior model, new evidence is data, and refactoring is the act of moving to a new model with a higher posterior probability.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "The consistent application of Narrative Refactoring converges on a `Coherence Narrative` with maximal predictive power and a minimal `Dissonance Ledger`."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "A system where multiple, mutually exclusive narratives maintain equal predictive power and minimal dissonance despite extensive refactoring, indicating a failure of the Gambit to converge."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [Software Refactoring]
  disambiguation: |
    While sharing its name with software refactoring (improving internal code structure without changing external behavior), Narrative Refactoring *fundamentally changes the external behavior* (the predictions) of the model. It is closer to "model replacement" or "paradigm shift" than to code cleanup.
