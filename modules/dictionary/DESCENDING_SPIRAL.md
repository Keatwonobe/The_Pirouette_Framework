  art: |
    The inward pull of chaos, a whirlpool that unwinds the woven thread of order. It is the necessary storm that clears the air, the collapse that precedes rebirth.
  law: |
    In a steady-state coherence field, the product of the Ascending (Ψ⁺) and Descending (Ψ⁻) spiral amplitudes remains constant (Ψ⁺Ψ⁻ = k), representing the conservation of duality between integration and dissipation.
  philosophy: |
    The Descending Spiral is not an antagonist to order but its dynamic partner. It represents the necessary process of decoherence and dissolution through which rigid, outdated structures are broken down, creating the potential for more complex and resilient forms of coherence to emerge.
pirouette_definition: |
  The component of the coherence field Ψ representing dissipative, turbulent flow. Within the Caduceus Lens formalism, the Descending Spiral (Ψ⁻) is one of two counter-rotating vortices, whose dominance signifies a transition towards decoherence, systemic collapse, or cognitive dissonance. Its interaction with its constructive counterpart, the Ascending Spiral (Ψ⁺), governs the system's helicity (ℭ) and its proximity to a phase transition.

    procedures:
      - name: Coherence Field Decomposition
        outline: |
          1. Measure the total coherence field Ψ in a system (e.g., phase synchrony in neural data, curl of opinion vectors in social data).
          2. Compute the field's local helicity or turbulence metric, yielding the Caduceus Operator ℭ.
          3. Decompose Ψ into laminar (Ψ⁺) and turbulent (Ψ⁻) components based on the equations Ψ = Ψ⁺ + Ψ⁻ and ℭ = ∇×(Ψ⁺−Ψ⁻) + λ(Ψ⁺·Ψ⁻), where higher turbulence corresponds to a greater |Ψ⁻|.
        expected_signals: [Increased spectral noise broadening, sharp increase in |ℭ|, phase-slip events in cognitive data, cascade onset signatures in social data.]
        pitfalls: [Difficulty in separating intrinsic system noise from true turbulent coherence flow, high spatio-temporal resolution required to resolve vortical structures.]

      The Caduceus is composed of **two counter-rotating coherence vortices** entwined along a central axis of temporal pressure (Γ)... Each vortex represents:

      * **Descending Spiral (Ψ⁻):** dissipative, turbulent coherence flow (dissonance, collapse, decoherence)

        Ψ⁻ represents the dissipative component of a coherence 'flow'. In fluid dynamics, ε is the rate at which turbulent kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy, representing the ultimate dissipative sink in the energy cascade. Both Ψ⁻ and ε quantify the 'chaotic' or 'destructive' aspect of a flow field.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from generic system decay or entropy. The Descending Spiral is a *structured* form of dissipation—a coherent vortex, not uniform, random noise. It is an active partner in the Caduceus dynamic, driving transitions rather than acting as a passive background effect.

# Descending Spiral

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The component of the coherence field Ψ representing dissipative, turbulent flow. Within the Caduceus Lens formalism, the Descending Spiral (Ψ⁻) is one of two counter-rotating vortices, whose dominance signifies a transition towards decoherence, systemic collapse, or cognitive dissonance. Its interaction with its constructive counterpart, the Ascending Spiral (Ψ⁺), governs the system's helicity (ℭ) and its proximity to a phase transition.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to the turbulent dissipation rate (ε) in fluid dynamics, the Descending Spiral Ψ⁻ quantifies the dissipative, decohering component of a generic coherence field. It represents the structured breakdown of order, akin to the energy cascade from large eddies to small-scale thermal dissipation, driving the system towards a turbulent or dissonant state. This process is central to modeling phase transitions across physical, cognitive, and social domains within the Pirouette Framework.
