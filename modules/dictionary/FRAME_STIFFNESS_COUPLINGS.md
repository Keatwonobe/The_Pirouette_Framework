  art: |
    Running couplings are the metronome marks scribbled in the score; the stiffnesses are the tension of the strings. Match them at the barrier, let the RG flow carry them down the stave, and the orchestra of the Standard Model plays in time.
  law: |
    The inverse squared gauge couplings (g_i) of the Standard Model at the coherence barrier (μ_c) are determined by the sum of the corresponding frame-stiffness (K_i) and a finite, scheme-dependent matching constant (Δ_i). The values of (K_i) are not free parameters but are supplied by the Pirouette Resonance Atlas.
  philosophy: |
    Frame-stiffness couplings replace the arbitrary, measured gauge couplings of the Standard Model with physically-motivated parameters representing the intrinsic rigidity of the U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) temporal frames. They serve as the fundamental UV boundary conditions for the Renormalization Group, linking low-energy physics to the high-energy Γ-field dynamics.
pirouette_definition: |
  A set of three high-energy, dimensionless parameters, (K_1, K_2, K_3), that quantify the intrinsic rigidity of the U(1)(_Y), SU(2)(_L), and SU(3)(_c) frames, respectively. They are defined at the coherence barrier scale (μ_c) and serve as the UV boundary conditions for the Standard Model's gauge couplings via the barrier matching relation: (1/g_i^2(\mu_c) = K_i + \Delta_i). Their values are determined by the framework's Resonance Atlas, not by direct fitting to low-energy data.

        outline: |
          1. Measure the low-energy fine-structure constant (α_EM), weak mixing angle (sin²θ_W), and strong coupling (α_s) at a well-defined scale, typically the Z-pole mass (M_Z).
          2. Convert these measurements into the individual gauge couplings (g_1, g_2, g_3) at (M_Z) in a chosen scheme (e.g., MS-bar).
          3. Using the 2-loop (or higher) Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) of the Standard Model, run the couplings (g_i(M_Z)) up to the coherence barrier scale (μ_c).
          4. At (μ_c), calculate the finite matching terms (Δ_i), which are determined by framework principles.
          5. Infer the stiffness couplings via the matching relation: (K_i = 1/g_i^2(\mu_c) - \Delta_i).
          6. Compare the inferred (K_i) values to the predictions from the Resonance Atlas (XXP-BRIDGE-Γ-001) to test framework consistency.

      Provide the RG flow and finite matching that connect Pirouette’s frame-stiffness couplings at the coherence barrier to measured low-energy couplings:
      ({g'(\mu),,g(\mu),,g_s(\mu)}) ↔ ({K_1,,K_2,,K_3}) at (μ=μ_c),
      where (K_i ≡ 1/g_i^2) are stiffnesses of the clock (U(1)(_Y)), triad (SU(2)(_L)), and temporal-color (SU(3)(_c)) frames.

      (1/g_i^2(\mu_c) = K_i + \Delta_i), where (K_i) come from Pirouette’s Resonance Atlas and (Δ_i) are finite, scheme-dependent but observable-independent matching constants.

      Stiffness ratio (ρ_stiff = K_2/K_1) fixes (sin²θ_W(μ_c)) ⇒ predicts (sin²θ_W(M_Z)) after RG flow. QCD stiffness (K_3) plus running gives (α_s(M_Z)) and, with lattice input for nonperturbative conversion, a prediction for (Λ_QCD).

        Frame-stiffness couplings are operationally defined as the high-energy values of the inverse squared Standard Model gauge couplings, evaluated at the framework's coherence barrier scale (μ_c). The mapping is not exact due to the inclusion of finite, non-logarithmic matching terms (Δ_i) that encode the transition from the barrier-regulated regime to the SM EFT.

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol 'K' is heavily overloaded in physics (e.g., Kinetic Energy, spring constant, Boltzmann constant 'k'). Subscript 'i' and context are crucial for identification.]
  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a spring constant, which relates force to displacement, a frame-stiffness coupling relates the 'energy cost' to 'twisting' a gauge frame. It is an intrinsic property of the frame itself at high energies. It manifests as an inverse coupling strength (high stiffness implies weak coupling) rather than as a kinetic or potential energy term in a low-energy Lagrangian.

# Frame-stiffness Couplings

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A set of three high-energy, dimensionless parameters, (K_1, K_2, K_3), that quantify the intrinsic rigidity of the U(1)(_Y), SU(2)(_L), and SU(3)(_c) frames, respectively. They are defined at the coherence barrier scale (μ_c) and serve as the UV boundary conditions for the Standard Model's gauge couplings via the barrier matching relation: (1/g_i^2(\mu_c) = K_i + \Delta_i). Their values are determined by the framework's Resonance Atlas, not by direct fitting to low-energy data.

## EFT-First Summary
In the Pirouette Framework, Frame-stiffness Couplings (K_i) are the high-energy boundary conditions for the Standard Model's gauge couplings (g_i) at a fundamental scale (μ_c). They are operationally equivalent to the inverse squared couplings `1/g_i²(μ_c)` up to calculable, finite matching corrections (Δ_i). This approach replaces the three free gauge coupling parameters of the Standard Model with physically-motivated stiffness parameters derived from the framework's Resonance Atlas, turning them from free parameters into testable predictions.
