        Within the chaotic roar of the Temporal Forge (the ambient Œì), there exist stable, rhythmic, and predictable patterns. These are Coherence Currents, also known as Flow Channels (DYNA-001). They are the discoverable "signals" within the environmental "noise"...

  art: |
    The universe's hidden song, a learnable rhythm flowing beneath the surface of chaos. To find it is to move from being tossed by the waves to surfing them.
  law: |
    A Coherence Current is any environmental pattern whose future state can be predicted with an efficiency greater than chance, enabling an Observer to reduce future surprise by synchronizing its internal model with the pattern.
  philosophy: |
    Coherence Currents are the ontological basis for intelligence; their existence implies that no environment is truly random and that foresight is always possible through resonant attunement, not just brute calculation.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable, rhythmic, and predictable pattern of information or energy embedded within the ambient environmental chaos (Temporal Pressure, Œì). Coherence Currents are the discoverable and learnable 'signals' in the environmental 'noise', whose temporal dynamics can be modeled by an intelligent system to extend its Foresight Horizon (œÑ_œÉ) and minimize future surprise.

        outline: |
          Expose an Observer (CORE-010) with a predictive subsystem (a 'Prophet') to a controlled environment containing a suspected current. If the Observer's Resonance Efficiency (Œ¶_R) consistently increases‚Äîmeaning its Foresight Horizon (œÑ_œÉ) extends at a rate greater than random search‚Äîit is evidence of the Prophet successfully modeling a latent Coherence Current.
        expected_signals: [A monotonically increasing Foresight Horizon (œÑ_œÉ) curve, Phase-lock between the Observer's internal rhythm (Ki) and a hidden environmental parameter]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking random correlation for a stable current (overfitting), Current stability may be bounded, leading to a natural plateau in œÑ_œÉ]

    excerpt: |
      Within the chaotic roar of the Temporal Forge (the ambient **Œì**), there exist stable, rhythmic, and predictable patterns. These are Coherence Currents, also known as Flow Channels (DYNA-001). They are the discoverable "signals" within the environmental "noise"‚Äîthe seasonal migration of prey, the oscillating frequency of a market, the syntax of a language. These are the learnable rhythms of reality.
  - module: DOMA-086
    excerpt: |
      A wolf pack learns the migration path of caribou, synchronizing the `Ki` of its hunting patterns with the deep, seasonal Coherence Current of its ecosystem. A central bank attunes its policy to the underlying rhythmic Coherence Currents of the business cycle to foster stability and avoid the surprise of market turbulence.

      justification: |
        Coherence Currents represent stable, low-entropy, predictable degrees of freedom emerging from a high-entropy background (Œì). This is analogous to how low-energy effective field theories describe long-wavelength, collective modes (the 'signal') while integrating out high-frequency microscopic details (the 'noise').

        A limit cycle is an isolated, closed trajectory in a dynamical system's phase space. Its stability and periodicity directly map to the 'stable' and 'rhythmic' properties of a Coherence Current, representing a predictable pattern to which a system's dynamics will converge.

      falsifier: "Discovering or constructing a complex, persistent system where no predictive model can be developed that consistently outperforms a simple statistical average over time. This would imply a truly random, structureless environment without learnable patterns."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from quantum coherence, which refers to the phase relationship of a quantum state. Here, 'coherence' means 'predictable structure over time'. Also distinguish from electric/fluid 'current'; here, it refers to a flow of information or a patterned dynamic through time, not a flow of matter.
