    The score of the universe's shared song, written in the language of spacetime shear and twist. It captures the harmonies and dissonances broadcast by every charged entity, shaping the paths of all who listen.
  law: |
    The spacetime curvature experienced by a test charge is directly proportional to F_μν, which is defined as the exterior derivative of the coherence potential 4-vector A_μ (F = dA). Its dynamics are fully constrained by Maxwell's equations, d*F = 0 and dF = J.
  philosophy: |
    The existence of F_μν is the necessary physical consequence of demanding that a particle's internal phase is a private, local affair. To maintain this U(1) symmetry, a public, universal field must exist to mediate phase-difference information between points, proving that no resonant entity is truly isolated.

  An antisymmetric rank-2 tensor field derived from the exterior derivative of the 4-vector coherence potential A_μ as F_μν = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. F_μν is the mediating field required to preserve local U(1) gauge invariance in the Pirouette Lagrangian. Its components are the electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields, and it dictates the deviation of a charged particle's worldline from a flat-space geodesic via the Lorentz force law.

        outline: |
          1. Introduce a test particle of known charge q and rest mass m into the region of interest.
          2. Measure the particle's 4-velocity u^ν and 4-acceleration a^μ at a spacetime point.
          3. Reconstruct the components of F^μν using the Lorentz force law, a^μ = (q/m) F^μν u_ν.
          4. Repeat with different initial velocities to solve for all independent components of the tensor.
        expected_signals: [Non-zero 4-acceleration proportional to charge q and 4-velocity u^ν.]
        pitfalls: [The test charge's own field may perturb the measurement; other forces (e.g., gravity) must be independently measured and subtracted.]

      The electromagnetic field tensor F_munu (which contains the electric and magnetic fields) is defined from the potential A_mu as: F_munu = d_mu A_nu - d_nu A_mu. The Lagrangian for this new field itself takes the form L_EM = -(1/4) * F_munu * F^munu. When we add this to the Pirouette Lagrangian and apply the Euler-Lagrange equations...we derive the famous Maxwell's Equations.

    excerpt: |
      By calculating the geodesic equation on a coherence manifold where the connection has been modified by the presence of the potential A_mu...we find the equation of motion for a particle p is: dp_mu/d(tau) = q * F_munu * u^nu. This is the Lorentz force law, expressed in covariant form...It is the geometric consequence of a particle trying to travel in a straight line (a geodesic) through a region of the coherence manifold that has been "sheared" and "twisted".

        The mathematical definition, dynamic equations (Maxwell's), and coupling to matter (Lorentz force) are identical to the standard formulation.

# Electromagnetic Field Tensor

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An antisymmetric rank-2 tensor field derived from the exterior derivative of the 4-vector coherence potential A_μ as F_μν = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. F_μν is the mediating field required to preserve local U(1) gauge invariance in the Pirouette Lagrangian. Its components are the electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields, and it dictates the deviation of a charged particle's worldline from a flat-space geodesic via the Lorentz force law.

## EFT-First Summary
The Electromagnetic Field Tensor `F_μν` is the standard object in relativistic electrodynamics that combines the electric and magnetic fields into a single, Lorentz-covariant entity. It is defined as the 4-curl of the electromagnetic 4-potential `A_μ` and is directly responsible for the Lorentz force exerted on charged particles. Its dynamics are described by Maxwell's equations, making it a foundational element of both classical and quantum electrodynamics.
