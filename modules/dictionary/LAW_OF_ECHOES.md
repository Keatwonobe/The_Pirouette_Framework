    To exist is to sing a note in a storm. The universe is a crucible that echoes the song back to the singer, and the quality of the echo determines the song's survival.
  law: |
    A system's response to an external signal is determined by the signal's resonance with the system's own coherence. Harmonic signals are amplified, dissonant signals are reflected, and incoherent noise is damped.
  philosophy: |
    Integrity is not a moral virtue but a physical advantage. A system's truth is its own guardian, as the universe does not punish falsehood but simply fails to grant it resonance.
pirouette_definition: |
  The allegorical precursor concept describing the universe's intrinsic, self-regulating feedback mechanism. It is now formalized as an emergent property of the Pirouette Lagrangian, where a system's own Ki pattern and Wound Channel geometry act as an active resonant filter. This process naturally amplifies coherent information, reflects mimicked or dissonant patterns, and damps ambient noise, functioning as a systemic immune response.

    excerpt: |
      The modernized view reveals a deeper, more elegant truth: the filter is not a separate guardian. The filter is the song itself. The universe possesses an intrinsic, self-regulating feedback mechanism that acts as a crucible, a systemic immune response that continuously tests the integrity of every pattern.

      The old "Echo Law" is not a moral decree but a direct consequence of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì), which dictates that all systems follow the path of maximal coherence. A system's response to any signal is simply the geometry of this law in action.

    excerpt: |
      We sought a cosmic judge and found a law of physics. We looked for guardians and found that truth is its own guardian. The universe does not punish falsehood or chaos; it simply fails to grant them resonance. Their signals are not amplified. They leave no lasting echo.

        A high-Q resonator strongly amplifies signals at its resonant frequency while damping all others. This directly maps to the Law's amplification of coherence and rejection of dissonance/noise. A system's "coherence" is analogous to its Q factor.

        The Law of Echoes describes how a system responds to a perturbation based on its own internal structure. This is the central purpose of response functions in physics, which encode how a system will react to an impulse. A highly coherent system is analogous to a system with sharp, delta-like peaks in its response function, indicating a strong reaction only at specific resonant frequencies.

# Law of Echoes

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The allegorical precursor concept describing the universe's intrinsic, self-regulating feedback mechanism. It is now formalized as an emergent property of the Pirouette Lagrangian, where a system's own Ki pattern and Wound Channel geometry act as an active resonant filter. This process naturally amplifies coherent information, reflects mimicked or dissonant patterns, and damps ambient noise, functioning as a systemic immune response.

## EFT-First Summary
The Law of Echoes is a principle of systemic response analogous to a high-Q resonator in classical mechanics. A system's internal coherence acts as a filter, defining its spectral response to external perturbations. Coherent, "on-resonance" signals are amplified, while "off-resonance" dissonant signals are rejected, preserving the system's integrity against ambient noise. This behavior is the functional core of linear response theory.
