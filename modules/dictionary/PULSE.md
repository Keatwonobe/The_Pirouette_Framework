  art: |
    The resonant heartbeat of a system at a chosen scale, the ticking of a local clock nested within the larger symphony of time. It is the rhythm by which a process recognizes itself across moments.
  law: |
    The logarithmic rate of change of the Pulse with respect to scale L is a linear function of the local Coherence (K_τ) and Pressure (V_Γ), defining the system's temporal dilation or contraction: d(ln τ_p)/d(ln L) = β_τ(K_τ, V_Γ).
  philosophy: |
    Pulse provides the temporal anchor for scale-dynamics. By tracking how a system's characteristic 'beat' changes with perspective, we gain a predictive, scale-aware control law for its evolution, moving beyond static structures to the rhythm of their formation.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Pulse is the dominant temporal period of a system's autopoietic cycle at a specific scale L. It is one of the three core observables in the Pirouette Renormalization Group (PRG), alongside Coherence (K_τ) and Pressure (V_Γ), that collectively describe the system's state and its evolution under a change of scale.

          Isolate a signal within a window of scale L. Compute its power spectral density (e.g., via FFT or Welch's method). Identify the frequency of the dominant peak, f_p. The Pulse is τ_p = 1/f_p.

        In quantum systems, oscillation frequencies are set by energy differences (ω = ΔE/ħ), so the period is T = 2π/ω ∝ ħ/ΔE. The Pulse generalizes this concept to a scale-dependent, emergent energy gap in complex systems, where L acts as the renormalization scale.

# Pulse

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Pulse is the dominant temporal period of a system's autopoietic cycle at a specific scale L. It is one of the three core observables in the Pirouette Renormalization Group (PRG), alongside Coherence (K_τ) and Pressure (V_Γ), that collectively describe the system's state and its evolution under a change of scale.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pulse (τ_p) serves as the inverse of a system's effective, scale-dependent energy gap (τ_p ~ ħ/ΔE(L)). The Pirouette Renormalization Group (PRG) provides the flow equation for this energy gap, predicting how the system's intrinsic timescale dilates or contracts as a function of observation scale (L) and the local interplay of coherent structures (K_τ) and environmental driving (V_Γ). This maps the abstract concept of 'beat' to the concrete physics of energy-level renormalization.
