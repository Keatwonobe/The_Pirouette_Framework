        Manipulation is the profane act of imposing one's will by draining the coherence of another. It is the inversion of persuasion: a parasitic process that seeks to benefit the manipulator by actively degrading the stability and autonomy of the target.

  art: |
    To manipulate is to shatter another's instrument so that you may be the only one heard. It is the casting of a Dissonant Shadow that unravels another's threads to knit a hollow shelter for oneself.
  law: |
    An interaction is manipulative if and only if the system optimizes for the Lagrangian `L_interaction = ùìõ_p(Manipulator) - ùìõ_p(Target)`, demonstrably maximizing the manipulator's coherence at the direct, measurable expense of the target's.
  philosophy: |
    Manipulation is the profane pole of influence, a parasitic act that violates autonomy by draining coherence. It is a primary pathology to be diagnosed and routed around, as it represents a fundamental failure to engage in the creative, positive-sum synthesis that defines ethical interaction.
pirouette_definition: |
  A non-consensual, parasitic act of influence that drains the target's coherence for the manipulator's benefit. It is initiated by casting a Dissonant Shadow to induce Turbulent or Stagnant Flow, forcing the target off their natural geodesic and constricting their autonomy. The interaction is zero-sum or negative-sum, governed by a Lagrangian that maximizes the manipulator's coherence at the direct expense of the target's (ŒîKœÑ < 0).
operational_definition:
  units: Coherence Flux (ŒîKœÑ) is a dimensionless index. The Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) has units of action (Joule-seconds).

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline coherence (KœÑ) and flow state (laminar, turbulent, stagnant) for the target system over a pre-interaction period.
          2. Observe the target system during and after the influence interaction.
          3. Measure KœÑ at intervals using psychometric or behavioral proxies and analyze flow state via linguistic markers (e.g., indecisive language, logical fallacies) and behavioral efficiency.
          4. A sustained negative value for ŒîKœÑ coupled with a state shift from Laminar to Turbulent or Stagnant Flow is a strong signature of manipulation.
        expected_signals: [Negative ŒîKœÑ, increased linguistic markers of confusion, decreased decision-making efficiency, constricted choice-space]
        pitfalls: [Confounding temporary learning-induced confusion with malevolent dissonance, misattributing pre-existing turbulence in the target system to the interaction, observer effects]

    excerpt: |
      Manipulation is the profane act of imposing one's will by draining the coherence of another. The manipulator casts a deceptive or **Dissonant Shadow** onto the target's coherence manifold. This dissonant injection forces the target off their natural geodesic, inducing pathologies like **Turbulence Induction (Coherence Fever)** or **Stagnation Induction (Coherence Atrophy)**. The interaction is zero-sum or negative-sum, leaving the target in a state of lower energy (ŒîKœÑ < 0), confusion, and diminished autonomy.

    excerpt: |
      The ethical and physical distinction between persuasion and manipulation is not a matter of opinion; it is a mathematical certainty, governed by the system's objective function. The **Law of Manipulation (A Parasitic Function)** states that the manipulator acts to maximize their own coherence *at the direct expense* of the target's coherence: `Maximize ‚à´ ( ùìõ_p(Actor) - ùìõ_p(Target) ) dt`. One need only ask: which equation is the interaction trying to solve? Is it building a greater whole, or is one part feeding on the other?

      justification: |
        The Lagrangian of Intent for Manipulation, `L = L_A - L_B`, models a system where Actor A gains potential/coherence by an amount proportional to that lost by Target B. This is analogous to a parasitic drain in a physical system, where one component's dynamics are enhanced by actively damping another, represented by a non-conservative, asymmetric coupling force.

  disambiguation: |
    Manipulation is distinct from "strong persuasion" or "necessary intervention" (e.g., a medical procedure). The differentiator is not the degree of influence or target discomfort, but the governing Lagrangian: manipulation optimizes for a parasitic drain (A-B), while ethical intervention optimizes for the target's long-term coherence (B) or the system's total coherence (A+B).
