        Demonstrate that collisionless behavior of Œì reproduces observed Œ∫‚ÄìX‚Äëray separations and their redshift/mass scaling **without particulate CDM**, using the same frozen potential V(Œì) from COSMO‚ÄëŒì‚Äë000.

    A landscape etched in stone, inherited from a prior cosmic epoch. Its contours dictate the flow and clash of all subsequent structures, a fixed stage for cosmic drama.
  law: |
    The potential V(Œì) is fixed by fits to galaxy-scale phenomena (e.g., the Œ£‚ÇÄ locus in `COSMO-Œì-HALO`) and is not tuned when modeling cluster-scale dynamics. All cluster-scale collisional properties are derived consequences of this fixed potential, not independent fitted parameters.
  philosophy: |
    To enforce predictive power and falsifiability across astrophysical scales. By freezing V(Œì), the framework prohibits ad-hoc tuning, forcing a unified explanation for phenomena from galaxy cores to cluster mergers and demanding that the model survives or is broken by its own rigid consistency.
pirouette_definition: |
  The scalar potential V(Œì) governing the self-interaction of the Œì-field, whose functional form and parameters (e.g., mass `m_Œì`, coupling `Œª_4`) are calibrated and fixed ('frozen') in a parent module (e.g., `COSMO-Œì-000`, `COSMO-Œì-HALO`) using galaxy-scale observations. Subsequent modules, such as those for cluster mergers (`COSMO-002`), must inherit this potential without modification, treating its predictions as non-tunable outputs of the theory.

        outline: |
          1. Calibrate the parameters of V(Œì) (e.g., `m_Œì`, `Œª_4` in the `quadratic_plus_quartic` model) by fitting static Œì-halo solutions to a robust set of galaxy-scale observables, like the universal core surface density Œ£‚ÇÄ from `COSMO-Œì-HALO`.
          2. Freeze these parameter values in a framework-wide manifest.
          3. Use the fixed, non-tunable V(Œì) in simulations of a different physical regime, such as galaxy cluster mergers (`COSMO-002`).
          4. Compare derived predictions (e.g., lensing-gas offset Œîx, effective cross-section œÉ_eff/m) against cluster-scale observations. A significant, persistent mismatch falsifies the chosen V(Œì).

        The dynamics of the Œì-field are governed by a standard Klein-Gordon equation with a self-interaction term V'(Œì). The `COSMO-002` configuration specifies a `quadratic_plus_quartic` form, which is a direct analogue to the potential used for a real scalar field in Effective Field Theory to model particle self-interactions.

# Frozen Potential

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The scalar potential V(Œì) governing the self-interaction of the Œì-field, whose functional form and parameters (e.g., mass `m_Œì`, coupling `Œª_4`) are calibrated and fixed ('frozen') in a parent module (e.g., `COSMO-Œì-000`, `COSMO-Œì-HALO`) using galaxy-scale observations. Subsequent modules, such as those for cluster mergers (`COSMO-002`), must inherit this potential without modification, treating its predictions as non-tunable outputs of the theory.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of Effective Field Theory (EFT), the Frozen Potential V(Œì) is a classical scalar field potential, typically a polynomial like `V(œÜ) = ¬Ωm¬≤œÜ¬≤ + (Œª/4!)œÜ‚Å¥`. Its key feature within Pirouette is that its parameters (`m`, `Œª`) are fixed by low-energy (galaxy-scale) data and are not re-tuned for high-energy (cluster-scale) phenomena. This enforces a rigid, predictive structure, analogous to how the electron's mass is a fixed input across all QED calculations, making the framework highly falsifiable.
