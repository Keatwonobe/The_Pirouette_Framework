      snippet: |
        This module provides the protocol for the Cartography of Echoes, a method for detecting and mapping the persistent patterns carved into the fabric of a collective culture by significant historical events. It moves beyond analyzing history as a sequence of events and treats it as an active, physical geography—the Mnemonic Landscape.

  art: |
    The land holds the shape of every joy and sorrow it has witnessed. A cartographer of echoes learns to read these scars, making the landscape's memory visible so that those who walk upon it may finally choose where to build the future.
  law: |
    The probability of a culture repeating a historical pattern is inversely proportional to the coherence required to deviate from the geodesic carved by that pattern into its Mnemonic Landscape. Deviation from this path of least resistance requires an expenditure of coherence proportional to the gradient of the historical terrain.
  philosophy: |
    By reframing history as a persistent, active geometry rather than a concluded narrative, this protocol transforms historiography from a descriptive art into a diagnostic, predictive, and ultimately healing science for cultural systems.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Cartography of Echoes is the diagnostic protocol for rendering the Mnemonic Landscape of a geo-cultural region. It applies the principles of Wound Channels (CORE-011) to a composite Spatiotemporal Cultural Field, identifying and characterizing deviations from a baseline coherence model. The resulting map (M_ε) of Coherence Wells and Plateaus allows for a geometric diagnosis of cultural pathologies (e.g., Stagnant, Turbulent, or Eroding coherence flows) using the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003), enabling the formulation of targeted interventions.
operational_definition:
  units: The primary output, a map M_ε, is a dimensionless scalar field representing coherence deviation (Δℂ) over spatiotemporal coordinates. Feature properties are derived from this map.

        outline: |
          1. Collate diverse, geolocated cultural data streams (economic, linguistic, political, public health) into a composite Spatiotemporal Cultural Field.
          2. Calculate a Baseline Coherence Model for the region, representing a counterfactual history without major traumatic or foundational events.
          3. Subtract the baseline from the observed field to generate a deviation map, M_ε, revealing Coherence Wells and Plateaus.
          4. Characterize the geometry (Depth, Gradient Γ) and dynamics (Resonant Frequency κ_i) of each feature and diagnose its coherence flow as Stagnant, Turbulent, or Eroding.
        expected_signals: [Spatially localized, persistent negative coherence anomalies (Wells), broad, stable positive anomalies (Plateaus), cyclical spikes in cultural turbulence correlated with specific dates or symbols (Resonant Frequency activation)]
        pitfalls: [Spurious correlations in data streams, politically motivated or inaccurate baseline models, confirmation bias in interpreting the historical significance of anomalies.]

    excerpt: |
      The Mnemonic Landscape: The sum of these significant Wound Channels in a given geo-cultural region constitutes its Mnemonic Landscape. This is the effective terrain upon which all present-day social and political dynamics must navigate. This landscape has distinct features: Coherence Wells—sites of collective trauma that act as powerful attractors, pulling present-day events into cycles of repetition—and Coherence Plateaus, sites of profound cultural achievement that act as reservoirs of cultural resilience.
  - module: DOMA-137
    excerpt: |
      The health of a culture is a direct function of the flow of coherence across its Mnemonic Landscape. Using the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003), we can diagnose the pathologies of this flow not as moral failings, but as geometric disruptions. These include Stagnant Flow (The Unspoken Trauma), where a wound is suppressed; Turbulent Flow (The Perpetual Conflict), where a wound is perpetually re-opened; and Coherence Erosion (The Fading Myth), where a foundational source of identity degrades.

      rationale: |
        The PES model provides a robust, well-understood mathematical and conceptual framework for path-of-least-resistance dynamics. The Mnemonic Landscape (M_ε) acts as a potential field for cultural dynamics, where Coherence Wells are local minima (stable, traumatic attractors) and the "force" driving cultural change is analogous to the gradient of this potential. This directly maps to the core claim of the Cartography of Echoes that cultures follow geodesics on their Mnemonic Landscape.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "The geometric depth and gradient (Γ) of a Coherence Well, as measured by integrated Δℂ, directly correlate with the measurable energy (e.g., economic investment, political capital) required for a culture to successfully break a cycle of historical repetition associated with that well."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A cross-cultural study shows no significant correlation between the mapped geometry of traumatic historical events and the measured cost of successful restorative justice or reconciliation programs. Alternatively, cultures with 'shallow' mapped wounds prove just as resistant to change as those with 'deep' ones."

  disambiguation: |
    This is not psychogeography, which maps an individual's affective response to a place. It is also not standard historiography, which constructs narratives. Cartography of Echoes produces a quantitative, geometric map of collective historical stress fields that actively and predictably shape present-day dynamics.
