        - Laminar Execution: The plan is a successful geodesic. Actions flow efficiently toward the goal. Progress feels natural and steady. The pre-carved channel is deep and clear, and the system is in a state of high coherence.

triad:
  art: |
    The silent, powerful flow of a deep river in a well-carved channel, where will and reality move as one. Effort is transformed into momentum, not wasted on friction.
  law: |
    A system is in a state of Laminar Execution if and only if the rate of goal-advancing work is consistently high while the rate of corrective, unplanned work approaches zero.
  philosophy: |
    Laminar Execution is the empirical validation of a well-formed intent. It demonstrates that the plan was not merely a document, but a correct projection of a geodesic, making the desired future the path of least resistance for the present.
pirouette_definition: |
  The ideal state of plan execution, characterized by the smooth, efficient, and predictable flow of actions toward a defined objective. It indicates that the plan is a successful geodesic—a path of maximal coherence—and that the system's internal integrity (K_τ) is sufficient to overcome environmental pressures (V_Γ). In this state, progress feels steady and inevitable, as the pre-carved "Wound Channel" of the plan effectively guides the flow of events.

        outline: |
          1. Instrument project management and communication systems to log two categories of work: "Projected Work" (planned tasks, features) and "Corrective Work" (unplanned bug fixes, crisis meetings, rollbacks, rework).
          2. Over a defined time interval (e.g., a sprint or quarter), calculate the ratio of time/effort spent on Projected Work versus Corrective Work.
          3. Calculate the velocity of completing Projected Work (`R_prog`).
          4. Laminar Execution is indicated by a high, stable `R_prog` and a `R_corr` that is low and non-increasing. A high `R_corr` indicates Turbulence; a near-zero `R_prog` indicates Stagnation.
        expected_signals: [High ratio of planned-to-unplanned work, steady velocity on key metrics, low variance in cycle time.]
        pitfalls: [Confusing low activity with Laminar Flow (can be Stagnation), ignoring qualitative team feedback (e.g., burnout can temporarily mimic high output), using metrics that can be easily gamed.]

    excerpt: |
      The true test of a plan is not its elegance on paper, but its execution in reality. We can diagnose the health of any ongoing plan by applying the universal lens of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001).
      - Laminar Execution: The plan is a successful geodesic. Actions flow efficiently toward the goal. Progress feels natural and steady.
      - Turbulent Execution: The plan is misaligned with the true geodesic of the environment. Execution is chaotic, characterized by constant crises, wasted energy, and "firefighting."
      - Stagnant Execution: The plan is too rigid or flawed to navigate an unforeseen obstacle. Progress has halted.
  - module: DOMA-162
    excerpt: |
      The purpose of a masterful plan is to make the desired future the most "natural" and coherent path for action to follow, so that when the time comes, the water of reality flows along the intended course. This is why a brilliant strategy, once set in motion, can feel effortless and inevitable.

  candidates:
    - target: Laminar Flow (vs. Turbulent Flow)
      domain: CM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      equation_hint: |
        Execution State ∝ 1 / Re  (where Re is a conceptual Reynolds number)
      justification: |
        The term is a direct, deliberate analogy to fluid dynamics. Laminar Execution maps to the smooth, orderly flow of a fluid at low Reynolds numbers, where viscous forces (coherence) dominate over inertial forces (chaos). Turbulent Execution maps to chaotic, unpredictable flow at high Reynolds numbers, where environmental disruption overwhelms internal order.

      confidence: 0.95
  adopted:
    - target: Laminar Flow (in Fluid Dynamics)
      rationale: The entire Flow Dynamics lens (DYNA-001), including terms like "pressure," "turbulence," and "dam," is explicitly built on this fluid dynamics metaphor, making it the native and most coherent mapping.

  claims:
    - statement: "Systems in Laminar Execution exhibit a lower average context-switching cost per agent and a higher ratio of goal-advancing work to total work than systems in Turbulent Execution."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Discovering a system that is universally agreed to be in Laminar Execution (meeting goals efficiently and predictably) that also requires high levels of constant firefighting and context-switching for all agents."

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, Laminar Execution refers to the flow of abstract quantities like actions, information, and resources through a system executing a plan. It is a metaphor for operational health, not a literal description of fluid movement. The key parallel is the distinction between orderly, predictable flow and chaotic, inefficient flow.
