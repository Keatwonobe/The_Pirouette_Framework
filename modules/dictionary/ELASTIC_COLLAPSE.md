        *   **Elastic Collapse:** A recoverable failure. The system is pushed violently into turbulence or stagnation, but its underlying Wound Channel remains intact. Like a bent piece of steel, it retains the memory of its true shape. Once the external pressure is relieved, the system can use its Wound Channel as a guide to "snap back" to its previous state of laminar flow.

    A system stumbles, its song momentarily lost in static, but the melody remains etched in its core. Once the noise fades, it remembers its own tune and begins to sing again.
  law: |
    A system has undergone Elastic Collapse if, after the removal of a precipitating stressor (ΔΓ < 0), its primary flow diagnostics return to pre-stressor baseline values (within a defined tolerance ε) over a characteristic relaxation time (τ_relax).
  philosophy: |
    Elastic Collapse demarcates the boundary of true resilience. It asserts that a system's identity is not defined by its uninterrupted performance, but by its capacity to remember and return to its essential form after profound disruption. It is the proof of a system's will to cohere.
pirouette_definition: |
  A state of systemic failure, typically manifesting as acute Turbulence or Stagnation, where the system's underlying Wound Channel (CORE-011) remains intact. This preserved geometric memory of the healthy state allows the system to recover its original laminar flow and coherence patterns once the precipitating Temporal Pressure (Γ) is removed or sufficiently reduced. It is a failure of performance, not of identity.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline of the system's health metrics in a laminar state (e.g., Temporal Coherence Kτ, flow diagnostics).
          2. Apply a controlled, acute stressor to increase Temporal Pressure (Γ) until pathological flow (e.g., Turbulence) is observed and Kτ drops significantly.
          3. Completely remove the stressor.
          4. Monitor health metrics over time. Recovery to the baseline state (within tolerance) confirms the collapse was elastic. Failure to recover indicates a Critical Collapse.

    excerpt: |
      The most important question in any collapse is that of reversibility. This is determined by the integrity of the system's **Wound Channel** (CORE-011)—the geometric memory of its healthy, coherent state. Elastic Collapse is a recoverable failure. The system is pushed violently into turbulence or stagnation, but its underlying Wound Channel remains intact.
  - module: DOMA-118
    excerpt: |
      To assess the Wound Channel, examine the integrity of the system's core identity. Is the memory of its healthy pattern recoverable (Elastic)? Or has it been irrevocably erased (Critical)? This final step determines whether the task ahead is one of healing or of composing something new from the ruins.

        In continuum mechanics, elastic deformation is a temporary change in a material's shape under stress, which is fully recovered upon removal of the stress. This is a direct conceptual analog to a system returning to its original coherent state (shape) after a period of high Temporal Pressure (stress), guided by the restoring force of its Wound Channel.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'resilience,' which is the *capacity* for Elastic Collapse; Elastic Collapse is the *event* or *state* itself. Crucially, contrast with Critical Collapse, the antonym, where the system's Wound Channel is permanently damaged, preventing recovery to the original state and forcing it to find a new, simpler form of coherence.

# Elastic Collapse

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A state of systemic failure, typically manifesting as acute Turbulence or Stagnation, where the system's underlying Wound Channel (CORE-011) remains intact. This preserved geometric memory of the healthy state allows the system to recover its original laminar flow and coherence patterns once the precipitating Temporal Pressure (Γ) is removed or sufficiently reduced. It is a failure of performance, not of identity.

## EFT-First Summary
Elastic Collapse can be modeled as a system's field configuration (φ) being perturbed from the minimum of a potential well (V(φ)). The perturbation provides enough energy to explore higher regions of the potential but is insufficient to overcome the barrier to a different vacuum or an unbound state. The system's Wound Channel acts as the restoring force, analogous to the potential's shape, guiding φ back to its original ground state V(φ₀) once the perturbation ceases.
