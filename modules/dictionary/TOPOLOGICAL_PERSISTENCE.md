        Topological Persistence (τ_knot): A measure of a Knot's lifespan. It is directly proportional to its total internal coherence, amplified by a Topological Coherence Factor (C_topo)—a function of its crossing number (c) and other geometric invariants.

  art: |
    A memory, knotted into a scar, gains a life of its own. Its persistence is the song of its shape; a more intricate knot sings a longer, more resilient note against the silence of time.
  law: |
    The lifespan of a self-reinforcing system (a Knot) is proportional to its topological complexity. The more intricate the Knot's geometry, the greater its resistance to entropic decay under a given environmental pressure.
  philosophy: |
    This metric quantifies how transient experience becomes stable identity. It asserts that persistence is not merely stored energy, but structured information; the universe favors memories that are written in the robust language of topology.
pirouette_definition: |
  A metric for a Knot's lifespan and its resistance to decoherence, defined as the system's intrinsic temporal coherence (`T_a`) amplified by a dimensionless factor (`C_topo`) derived from its geometric complexity, and scaled inversely by the erosive force of the ambient `Temporal Pressure` (Γ). It quantifies the stability gained when a `Wound Channel` forms a self-reinforcing, resonant closed loop.

        outline: |
          1. Identify a candidate system exhibiting long-term stability and resonant behavior (a suspected Knot).
          2. Characterize the system's topology using a non-invasive probe to determine its invariants, primarily the crossing number `c`, to estimate `C_topo`.
          3. Measure the system's intrinsic coherence time `T_a` in a quiescent state (Γ→0) via spectral analysis of its fundamental resonance.
          4. Measure the ambient `Temporal Pressure` Γ of the system's environment.
          5. Calculate `τ_knot` using the defining relation: `τ_knot = k * (T_a * C_topo) / f(Γ)`, where `k` and `f` are empirically determined scaling factors for the system class.
        expected_signals:
          - Extremely sharp, stable resonant peaks in the coherence spectrum.
          - A stepwise increase in observed lifespan corresponding to increases in topological complexity (`c`).
        pitfalls:
          - Misidentification of the knot type, leading to an incorrect `C_topo`.
          - Failure to isolate the system from external Γ during the `T_a` measurement.
          - The function `C_topo(c)` may be non-linear and system-dependent.

    excerpt: |
      A Knot does not simply *store* information; the topology of the Knot *is* the information... To erase the memory is to destroy the entity. With this new grounding, we can define modern metrics for analyzing a Knot's properties: Topological Persistence (τ_knot): A measure of a Knot's lifespan. It is directly proportional to its total internal coherence, amplified by a Topological Coherence Factor (C_topo)—a function of its crossing number (c) and other geometric invariants.
  - module: DOMA-148
    excerpt: |
      If the phases align, a powerful `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012) occurs... The total phase shift around the loop must equal an integer multiple of 2π, creating a perfect, self-sustaining standing wave of coherence. This is the resonant handshake, the "click" of the topological lock. This self-resonant feedback loop creates a point of immense stability. The Knot effectively "locks" itself into place, carving a deep, localized well in the coherence manifold.

      equation_hint: |
        C_topo = g(V_K(t)) where V_K(t) is a knot polynomial.
      justification: |
        Knot theory provides a formal language for quantifying topological complexity. `C_topo` is proposed as a physical manifestation of a knot invariant, where more complex invariants correspond to higher coherence amplification and thus greater persistence.

      justification: |
        In condensed matter systems with topological order, the system is protected from local perturbations by a finite energy gap (ΔE). The persistence of the topological state is exponentially dependent on this gap. `τ_knot` plays a role analogous to this protected lifetime.

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol τ is widely used for relaxation times or time constants. The subscript `_knot` is crucial for disambiguation.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from generic system `lifespan` or `coherence time`. `τ_knot` specifically measures the *additional* persistence afforded by a system's knotted, self-reinforcing topological structure, not just its material or energetic stability.
