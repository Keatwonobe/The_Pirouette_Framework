  art: |
    The Action Functional traces the cost of every possible dance a system could perform over one cycle. The universe, in its elegance, always chooses the most graceful path—the one of least effort. This is the rhythm we observe as being.
  law: |
    A stable, periodic Ki rhythm must follow a trajectory φ*(t) that minimizes the Action Functional J[φ] over its period τₚ. This is a direct consequence of the principle of stationary action applied to a closed cycle.
  philosophy: |
    The minimization of the Action Functional is not merely a calculational tool; it is the mathematical proof that closes the Pirouette's autopoietic loop. It transforms the framework's core cycle from a philosophical assertion into a necessary, verifiable consequence of its dynamics, proving that stable rhythms are an inevitable feature of reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  A scalar functional, J[φ], representing the total Pirouette Lagrangian integrated over one full cycle of period τₚ. Its arguments are the entire path of the Ki phase, φ(t), over that interval. Applying the calculus of variations to find a path φ*(t) that minimizes J[φ] subject to periodic boundary conditions (φ(0)=φ(τₚ)) yields the physical trajectory of a stable Ki rhythm, proving the existence of the Pirouette Cycle.

        outline: |
          1. Formulate the Action J[φ] from the system's Lagrangian (K_τ and V).
          2. Derive the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion.
          3. Use a numerical shooting method: guess an initial state (φ(0), φ̇(0)) and period τₚ.
          4. Integrate the equations of motion over [0, τₚ] and compute the residual R = [φ(τₚ)−φ(0), φ̇(τₚ)−φ̇(0)].
          5. Iteratively correct the initial guess and τₚ using a Newton-Raphson method until the residual ||R|| is below a tolerance threshold. The resulting trajectory is the minimizer φ*(t).

      justification: |
        The Pirouette Action Functional is mathematically identical to the action in classical mechanics. The principle of stationary action states that the true evolution of a system between two points in time is the one that makes the action functional stationary (usually a minimum). Pirouette applies this same principle to find stable *periodic* paths.

# Action Functional

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A scalar functional, J[φ], representing the total Pirouette Lagrangian integrated over one full cycle of period τₚ. Its arguments are the entire path of the Ki phase, φ(t), over that interval. Applying the calculus of variations to find a path φ*(t) that minimizes J[φ] subject to periodic boundary conditions (φ(0)=φ(τₚ)) yields the physical trajectory of a stable Ki rhythm, proving the existence of the Pirouette Cycle.

## EFT-First Summary
The Action Functional `J[φ]` is the Pirouette Framework's direct analogue to the **Action (S)** in classical and quantum field theory. As defined in Goldstein's *Classical Mechanics*, the principle of stationary action dictates that a system's dynamics follow a path that minimizes the time-integral of the Lagrangian. The Pirouette Framework applies this same mathematical principle to prove the existence of stable, periodic orbits, which form the basis of all coherent phenomena.
