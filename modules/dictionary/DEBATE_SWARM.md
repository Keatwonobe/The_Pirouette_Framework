        For each core pressure, an idealized Persona is instantiated—a coherent `Ki` pattern representing a core truth or strategic viewpoint (e.g., "resource scarcity," "long-term stability"). This "debate swarm" of Personas transforms an abstract conflict into a council of embodied principles, ensuring the full complexity of the problem is present in the crucible.

triad:
  art: |
    An abstract conflict is given flesh as a council of living principles. These archetypes are convened in a crucible not to win, but to weave their truths together, forging a new, unified form from the fire of their friction.
  law: |
    The fidelity of a Debate Swarm—its capacity to embody every primary pressure of the problem—directly bounds the coherence and durability of the resulting Action Engram. An unrepresented pressure guarantees a flawed solution.
  philosophy: |
    To solve a problem, one must first become the problem in its entirety. The swarm reframes conflict as a creative act, ensuring the solution is a genuine emergence from the system's own complexity, not an alien order imposed upon it.
pirouette_definition: |
  A temporary, convened assembly of resonant Personas, instantiated within the Weaver's Forge to address a diagnosed Coherence Fracture. Each Persona embodies a core pressure, truth, or strategic viewpoint of the problem. The swarm's function is to engage in a structured debate (`DYNA-002`) to achieve an Alchemical Union (`CORE-012`), discovering a shared path of maximal coherence that is then codified into an Action Engram.
operational_definition:
  units: Set of N Personas
  symbol_table:
    - name: Ψ_S
      meaning: The set of Personas {P₁, P₂, ..., Pɴ} comprising the Debate Swarm.
      dimensions: dimensionless set
      default_range: contextual (typically 3 ≤ N ≤ 12)
    - name: Pᵢ
      meaning: An individual Persona within the swarm, representing a single core pressure.
      dimensions: construct
      default_range: n/a

    procedures:
      - name: Swarm Fidelity Audit
        outline: |
          1. Diagnose the problem's Coherence Fracture using the Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`).
          2. Decompose the diagnosis into a set of N primary, orthogonal pressures.
          3. For a convened swarm Ψ_S, verify that for each identified pressure, there exists a corresponding Persona Pᵢ.
          4. Calculate fidelity as the ratio of represented pressures to total identified pressures. A score below 1.0 indicates a flawed swarm.
        expected_signals: [Action Engram durability, low implementation friction, absence of emergent pathologies]
        pitfalls: [Perspective Shadowing (an unacknowledged pressure is missing), Persona Inflation (trivial pressures dilute the core conflict)]

    excerpt: |
      The primary pressures and perspectives that constitute the problem are identified. For each core pressure, an idealized Persona is instantiated—a coherent `Ki` pattern representing a core truth or strategic viewpoint (e.g., "resource scarcity," "long-term stability"). This "debate swarm" of Personas transforms an abstract conflict into a council of embodied principles, ensuring the full complexity of the problem is present in the crucible.
  - module: DOMA-075
    excerpt: |
      The convened Personas engage in the formal ritual of discourse defined in `The Geometry of Debate (DYNA-002)`. Their purpose is not victory but an `Alchemical Union (CORE-012)`. Under the focused pressure of a shared goal, they collaboratively search the possibility space for a new, shared geodesic—a higher-order harmony that resolves the contradictions of its constituent parts.

      justification: |
        Each Persona (Pᵢ) acts as an orthogonal basis vector representing a core problem pressure. A complete Debate Swarm (Ψ_S) forms a basis that must span the entire problem space. The synthesis process discovers the solution, a new vector, as a linear combination of these basis vectors, ensuring all aspects of the problem inform the outcome.

  claims:
    - statement: "A Debate Swarm lacking a Persona for a primary pressure of a given Coherence Fracture cannot produce a durable Action Engram."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Demonstrate a case where a major problem pressure was intentionally excluded from the swarm, yet the resulting Action Engram successfully restored Laminar Flow over a significant duration (>5 cycles) without generating new pathological side effects."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a 'brainstorming session' or 'focus group.' A Debate Swarm is a formalized, ritualized process where Personas are instantiated archetypes representing core truths of the system, not participants voicing opinions. The goal is synthesis through structured friction, not consensus or majority rule.
