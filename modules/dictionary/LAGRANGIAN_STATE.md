        The `lagrangian_state` object is the heart of the record. It is a direct, real-time expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`). It must contain the fundamental components, not derived values.

  art: |
    The system's state captured in a single, unadorned breath. It is not the story of the dance, but the posture, balance, and energy of the dancer in the instant before the next movement.
  law: |
    The Lagrangian State is a structured data object containing the direct, real-time measurements of the fundamental components of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`K_τ` and `V_Γ`). It must not contain values derived from these components, such as the final Lagrangian `𝓛_p`.
  philosophy: |
    To ensure Observational Parity, the language of reality and the language of simulation must be identical. The Lagrangian State is this common tongue, a universal data structure that allows analytical tools to treat observations and simulations as equally valid, interchangeable streams of evidence about a system's dynamics.
pirouette_definition: |
  The core data object within a Chronoscript record that contains the direct measurements of the components of a system's Pirouette Lagrangian at a discrete point in time. It is a structured snapshot comprising the system's kinetic qualities (Temporal Coherence `K_τ`) and its potential energy cost (Temporal Pressure `V_Γ`), providing the minimal, fundamental information required to calculate the system's action.

        outline: |
          A Pirouette-compliant data producer (e.g., an observational ritual apparatus or a computational simulation) samples the system at a specific timestamp. It directly measures the components (`time_adherence_Ta`, `pirouette_cycle_τp`, `gamma_Γ`, `current_ki_pattern`) and assembles them into the `lagrangian_state` object within a new Chronoscript record.
        expected_signals: [time_adherence_Ta, pirouette_cycle_τp, gamma_Γ]
        pitfalls: [Including derived values (e.g., `𝓛_p`) in the state object, violating the Integrity mandate. Recording physically impossible values, such as `time_adherence_Ta > 1.0` or `pirouette_cycle_τp <= 0`.]

    excerpt: |
      The `lagrangian_state` object is the heart of the record. It is a direct, real-time expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`). It must contain the fundamental components, not derived values.
  - module: DOMA-029
    excerpt: |
      This protocol is the direct instrumentation of the framework's central equation. The `lagrangian_state` object is the discrete, digital representation of the components of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`) as defined in `CORE-006`. A time-stream of Chronoscript records is a sampled approximation of the system's "action" integral, `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`.

        L(q, q̇) = T(q̇) - V(q)  vs.  𝓛_p = K_τ(S_𝓛) - V_Γ(S_𝓛)
      justification: |
        In Classical Mechanics, the state `(q, q̇)` (generalized coordinates and velocities) provides all necessary information to compute the kinetic `T` and potential `V` energies. Similarly, the Lagrangian State `S_𝓛` provides all fundamental measurements needed to compute the Pirouette kinetic term `K_τ` and potential term `V_Γ`. It represents the minimal set of variables defining the system's dynamics at an instant.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a classical state vector which typically contains position and momentum, or a quantum state vector in Hilbert space, the Pirouette Lagrangian State is a specific data structure defined by the Chronoscript schema. It does not represent spatial coordinates but rather the fundamental measures of a system's temporal coherence and environmental pressure.
