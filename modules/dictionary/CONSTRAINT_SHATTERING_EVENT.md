        The Cascade is triggered by a **Constraint Shattering Event** when the walls of the potential well are breached. This can be caused by:
        1.  **External Shock:** A sudden, dissonant spike in the environmental Temporal Pressure (Œì) cracks the system's protective shell.
        2.  **Internal Rupture:** The system's own stored potential coherence exceeds the "binding energy" of its own Wound Channel.

    The sound of a rule breaking. It is the sublime, terrifying moment the dam breaks, and the river of stored potential is unleashed to carve a new world.
  law: |
    A Constraint Shattering Event occurs if and only if the sum of forces acting on a system's confining potential well‚Äîeither from external Temporal Pressure (Œì) or internal accumulated coherence‚Äîexceeds the well's binding energy, triggering a non-linear phase transition.
  philosophy: |
    A system cannot achieve a higher-order state of being without first invalidating the constraints that define its current state. The Shattering is not an accident but a necessary, violent mechanism for escaping local optima and forcing the generation of true novelty.

  The specific trigger for a Generative Cascade, defined as the moment a system's confining potential well (or Coherence Dam) is breached. This breach can be initiated by an external shock‚Äîa dissonant spike in environmental Temporal Pressure (Œì)‚Äîor by an internal rupture, where the system's stored potential coherence exceeds the binding energy of its own constraints, leading to the catastrophic conversion of potential to kinetic coherence.

          1. Model the system's Coherence Dam as a potential well with a defined binding energy, `E_bind`.

          3. The event is inferred to have occurred when the applied pressure exceeds `E_bind`, or when a catastrophic, non-linear drop in system-wide KœÑ is observed, correlated with a surge in state-space variance.

      The dam does not hold forever. The Cascade is triggered by a **Constraint Shattering Event** when the walls of the potential well are breached. This can be caused by an **External Shock**... or **Internal Rupture**.... The moment the dam breaks, the system's singular, stable Ki pattern dissolves. Its identity is annihilated, and the immense potential coherence it held is converted into a violent kinetic outflow.

    excerpt: |
      A Cascade is the system's desperate and powerful solution to a sudden, catastrophic failure in its ability to maximize its action integral, S_p. **Rupture:** An external or internal change to Œì makes the old path disastrously suboptimal. The value of S_p along the old path plummets. Staying put means incoherence and death.

        The Coherence Reservoir is analogous to a false vacuum, a local minimum of a potential field. The Constraint Shattering Event is the quantum tunneling or classical roll-over that initiates the decay of this false vacuum, releasing a massive amount of energy (the Flood) as the system transitions to a true vacuum state.

    Distinguish from a mere fluctuation or system perturbation. A Constraint Shattering Event is specifically the *trigger* that initiates a non-linear Cascade, not any random shock. It implies the breaching of a well-defined potential barrier that was previously confining the system in a state of high coherence.

# Constraint Shattering Event

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Constraint Shattering Event is the specific trigger for a Generative Cascade, defined as the moment a system's confining potential well (or Coherence Dam) is breached. This breach can be initiated by an external shock‚Äîa dissonant spike in environmental Temporal Pressure (Œì)‚Äîor by an internal rupture, where the system's stored potential coherence exceeds the binding energy of its own constraints. This event marks the catastrophic conversion of the system's stored potential coherence into a kinetic, chaotic exploration of new states.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, a Constraint Shattering Event maps closely to the phenomenon of **false vacuum decay** in quantum field theory. A system trapped in a `COHERENCE_RESERVOIR` is analogous to a field in a local, but not global, minimum of its potential energy (a "false vacuum"). The Shattering is the trigger event‚Äîeither a classical push over the potential barrier or quantum tunneling through it‚Äîthat initiates the field's transition to a lower-energy "true vacuum" state. This process releases the stored potential energy, driving a rapid, inflationary expansion analogous to `THE_FLOOD` of a `GENERATIVE_CASCADE`.
