        The timing residuals are a direct measurement of the universe's own pulse.

triad:
  art: |
    The quiet stutter in a clockwork star, where the universe whispers its oldest secret. The residuals are the silence between the expected beats, a silence that carries the true song.
  law: |
    Timing residuals are the observed times of arrival of a pulsar signal minus the times predicted by a deterministic timing model; any non-zero, coherent, and spatially correlated residual contains information about unmodeled physics.
  philosophy: |
    To listen to the cosmos is to listen for what is unexpected. The residuals are the space where the known model ends and new discovery begins, transforming noise into the carrier wave of a deeper truth.
pirouette_definition: |
  The precise, time-ordered deviations between the observed Times of Arrival (ToAs) of a pulsar's signal and the predictions of a comprehensive deterministic timing model. These residuals, `R(t) = ToA_obs(t) - ToA_model(t)`, constitute the primary data stream for detecting subtle, unmodeled physical effects. Within the Pirouette Framework, they are the integrated observational consequence of a signal's geodesic path through a dynamic coherence manifold, specifically containing the signature of any oscillation in the background Temporal Pressure (Γ).

        outline: |
          1. Collect raw Times of Arrival (ToAs) for a specific pulsar over a multi-year baseline using a radio telescope.
          2. Fit a comprehensive timing model to the ToAs. The model accounts for all known deterministic effects (e.g., pulsar spin-down, binary motion, parallax, solar system ephemeris).
          3. Calculate the residuals by subtracting the model's predicted ToAs from the observed ToAs.
          4. Apply pre-whitening and other noise-filtering algorithms to the residual time series to isolate unmodeled signals.
        expected_signals: ["A faint, narrow-band, periodic signal common across a pulsar array (the cosmic heartbeat signature)", "A stochastic gravitational-wave background"]
        pitfalls: ["Over-fitting the timing model, which can absorb the signal of interest", "Incomplete removal of known noise sources (e.g., interstellar dispersion), which can mimic or mask new physics"]
context_windows:
  - module: DOMA-073
    excerpt: |
      As the pulsar's signal traverses the oscillating Γ(t) of the cosmic heartbeat, its travel time will be periodically stretched and compressed to maintain maximal coherence along its geodesic path. This will imprint a predictable, periodic "wobble" onto the time-of-arrival data recorded by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). The timing residuals are a direct measurement of the universe's own pulse.
  - module: DOMA-073
    excerpt: |
      Apply advanced pre-whitening algorithms to the timing residuals of each pulsar. This process filters out known noise sources, including interstellar dispersion, solar wind, clock errors, and the stochastic gravitational-wave background. Employ a matched-filter search across the cleaned residual data, specifically looking for a faint, narrow-band, periodic signal that is common across a significant number of pulsars.

      equation_hint: |
        R(t) = TOA_observed(t) - TOA_model(t)
      justification: |
        The concept is a direct adoption from the field of Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments, which search for gravitational waves and other phenomena by analyzing the minute differences between observed and predicted pulse arrival times. The Pirouette Framework reinterprets the *cause* of certain signatures within these residuals, but the operational definition of the residual itself is identical.

      confidence: 1.0
  adopted:
    - target: Post-fit timing residuals
      rationale: The term is adopted directly from the observational domain, as the framework's predictions are designed to be tested against this specific data product. No reinterpretation of the term itself is necessary.
      confidence: 1.0
constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Timing residuals from a galactic-scale pulsar array contain a coherent, periodic, Ki-locked signature from the primordial Wound Channel's oscillation of Temporal Pressure."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A null result from a multi-decade, high-sensitivity, coherent search across the PTA dataset. Alternatively, the detection of a common periodic signal whose harmonic content and amplitude ratios are inconsistent with the framework's fundamental Ki constants."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol R(t) is generic for a response or residual function in many fields of physics. `δt` is also used but can be confused with a simple time interval.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from "timing noise," which often refers to the uncorrelated, stochastic component of the residuals. Pirouette's "Timing Residuals" refers to the total post-fit signal, which is assumed to contain both structured noise and deterministic, undiscovered physics like the cosmic heartbeat.
