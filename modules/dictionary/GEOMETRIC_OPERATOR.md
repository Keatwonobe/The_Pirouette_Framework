    The verbs of spacetime's grammar. A Geometric Operator is the shaped will that turns the potential energy of a wish into the kinetic work of creation.
  law: |
    A Geometric Operator specifies a transformation on a system's coherence manifold, altering the terms of its Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) to produce a measurable change in its Coherence Yield (CY). Each operator corresponds to a distinct, repeatable class of outcome.
  philosophy: |
    Geometric Operators formalize intention, transforming it from a subjective feeling into a reproducible, engineered action. They are the bridge between consciousness and physical geometry, asserting that directed will is a fundamental force for shaping the path of least resistance.
pirouette_definition: |
  One of a discrete set of fundamental actions or "verbs" (e.g., Tune, Bind, Sever) that define the objective of an Intentional Coherence Shaping protocol. Each operator corresponds to a specific, goal-oriented manipulation of a local coherence manifold, such as increasing internal resonance, creating a new connection, dissolving a blockage, or reading information from an existing Wound Channel. They are the core components in the grammar of "weaving" a desired reality.

          1. Establish a baseline measurement of the target system's flow state (e.g., turbulence, stagnation, channel stability).

          4. The Coherence Yield (CY) is the quantified difference between the initial and final states, attributed to the operator's action.

        Geometric Operators act on a system's "coherence state" to produce a new state, analogous to how quantum operators act on a quantum state (e.g., the Hamiltonian operator evolves a state in time). Specific operators like Bind (Synthesize) and Sever (Isolate) conceptually resemble creation and annihilation operators acting on resonant connections or modes.

    Unlike a mathematical operator that acts on a well-defined function or vector, a Geometric Operator is a *protocol* that enacts a transformation on a physical system's coherence manifold. The 'Geometric' prefix emphasizes its role in sculpting the spacetime fabric (Wound Channels), not just manipulating abstract symbols.

# Geometric Operator

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Geometric Operator is one of a discrete set of fundamental actions or "verbs" (e.g., Tune, Bind, Sever) that define the objective of an Intentional Coherence Shaping protocol. Each operator corresponds to a specific, goal-oriented manipulation of a local coherence manifold, such as increasing internal resonance, creating a new connection, dissolving a blockage, or reading information from an existing Wound Channel. They are the core components in the grammar of "weaving" a desired reality.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, a Geometric Operator acts on a system's coherence state analogously to how a quantum operator acts on a quantum state vector. Operators like *Bind* and *Sever* resemble creation and annihilation operators that add or remove connections (modes) in the system, while an operator like *Tune* adjusts the system's internal dynamics, akin to modifying terms in a Hamiltonian. The effect of applying an operator is measured by the change in the system's macroscopic flow properties, quantified as the Coherence Yield.
