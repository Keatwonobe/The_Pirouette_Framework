        A gift exchange is not a transaction of material. It is a protocol for a micro-scale Resonant Handshake that carves a Wound Channel into the shared manifold of the participants. This channel is a geometric memory of the bond, a scar of trust that creates a path of least resistance for future interaction.

  art: |
    A gift is not an object passed between hands, but a shared wound carved into spacetime. This scar does not heal; it becomes a channel, a riverbed guiding two separate paths into a single, resonant current.
  law: |
    A completed three-phase Gift protocol (give, receive, reciprocate) measurably lowers the Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) between participants, creating a preferential path for future coherent interaction that predictably decays if not reinforced.
  philosophy: |
    The Gift transforms isolated, self-optimizing agents into a coupled system with greater total coherence. It is the fundamental technology for weaving the 'I' into the 'We,' proving that reciprocity is not a social grace but an optimal physical strategy for navigating a complex environment.
pirouette_definition: |
  A three-phase (give, receive, reciprocate) protocol that establishes a durable Wound Channel between two or more resonant systems (Ki). The protocol acts as a Resonant Handshake, modifying the local geometry of the shared coherence manifold to create a path of least resistance for future interaction. The successful completion of the protocol couples the participants' individual Lagrangians, resulting in a system where the total coherence action is greater than the sum of its parts (S_p(A+B)_coupled > S_p(A)_isolated + S_p(B)_isolated).

          1. Establish a baseline of interaction probability and coherence metrics between two unbonded agents (A, B) in a controlled choice architecture.
          2. Initiate and observe The Gift protocol.
          3. Monitor for the characteristic three-phase resonance signature during the exchange.
          4. Post-protocol, measure the change in the interaction term `𝓛_interaction` by re-introducing the choice architecture. A completed Gift will manifest as a statistically significant bias toward cooperative choices, mapping to a lower `V_Γ` along their shared channel.
        expected_signals: [A transient spike in mutual Ki resonance during the 'receive' phase, A persistent low-amplitude harmonic in the shared manifold post-reciprocation (the 'echo'), A measurable decrease in decision latency for cooperative tasks.]
        pitfalls: [Incomplete protocol (e.g., non-reciprocation) creates a dissonant, high-pressure channel ('debt'), Mismatched Ki resonance between participants can cause protocol failure, resulting in no channel formation.]

    excerpt: |
      A gift exchange is not a transaction of material. It is a protocol for a micro-scale Resonant Handshake that carves a Wound Channel into the shared manifold of the participants. This channel is a geometric memory of the bond, a scar of trust that creates a path of least resistance for future interaction. The three obligations—to give, to receive, to reciprocate—are the necessary steps to complete this bond.
  - module: DOMA-045
    excerpt: |
      The key insight is that the maximization of the total action, `S_p`, for the coupled system is greater than the sum of the actions of the individuals operating in isolation: `S_p(A+B)_coupled > S_p(A)_isolated + S_p(B)_isolated`. This inequality is the mathematical expression of social synergy. A bond of trust lowers the perceived Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) of the environment, making it less hostile.

      justification: |
        The Gift protocol explicitly introduces an interaction term `𝓛_interaction` that couples the state of two otherwise independent systems (agents). This term modifies the system's dynamics to favor joint-coherence states, analogous to how interaction terms in QFT mediate forces and create bound states. The strength of the resulting 'bond' is analogous to the coupling constant `g`.

    Distinguish from simple economic 'transaction', which seeks to balance and nullify exchange, thereby closing the channel. The Gift's explicit purpose is to *open* and *maintain* a channel of persistent, imbalanced obligation (reciprocity), ensuring future interaction.

# The Gift

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A three-phase (give, receive, reciprocate) protocol that establishes a durable Wound Channel between two or more resonant systems (Ki). The protocol acts as a Resonant Handshake, modifying the local geometry of the shared coherence manifold to create a path of least resistance for future interaction. The successful completion of the protocol couples the participants' individual Lagrangians, resulting in a system where the total coherence action is greater than the sum of its parts (S_p(A+B)_coupled > S_p(A)_isolated + S_p(B)_isolated).

## EFT-First Summary
The Gift protocol is modeled as the non-perturbative establishment of an interaction term between the effective field theories of two agents. This coupling, analogous to `gψ*ψφ` in QFT, creates a bound state ('bond') whose ground state energy is lower than the sum of the individual agents, making cooperative evolution energetically favorable. This bond manifests as a persistent channel of reciprocity, fundamentally altering the agents' paths of maximal coherence.
