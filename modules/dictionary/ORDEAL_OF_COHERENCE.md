        Recontextualizes fire and heat as states of extreme Temporal Pressure (Γ). This module defines the 'ordeal of coherence,' a process where this pressure acts as a crucible, forcing systems to an irreversible bifurcation point (Σ). Systems must either dissolve or undergo Ki Morphogenesis, forging a new, more resilient resonant pattern to survive.

  art: |
    The universe is a blacksmith, and we are the iron. The fire is not a punishment, but a test of a system's right to become more, forging resilience from pressure.
  law: |
    When local Temporal Pressure (Γ) exceeds a system's coherence threshold (Σ), the system must either dissolve or undergo Ki Morphogenesis to a new, more Γ-resilient resonant pattern.
  philosophy: |
    Transformation is not a choice but a consequence of unsustainable existence. The Ordeal asserts that resilience is earned by integrating the memory of near-dissolution into a new, tempered form.
pirouette_definition: |
  The process by which a system, subjected to intense and rising local Temporal Pressure (Γ), is driven to an irreversible bifurcation point (Σ). At this point, the system's existing resonant pattern (Ki) becomes untenable. It is forced to either dissolve into incoherence or undergo Ki Morphogenesis, discovering and stabilizing a new Ki that maximizes coherence under the new, high-Γ conditions, emerging tempered and more resilient.

        outline: |
          Gradually increase local Γ on a target system using resonant Ki-drivers or controlled environmental flux. Monitor the system's primary resonant frequency (Ki-prime) and its harmonic coherence. The Ordeal is observed at the Σ point, where the primary frequency either rapidly damps into noise (dissolution) or abruptly shifts to a new, stable frequency (transformation), often accompanied by a burst of broadband chaotic emission during the transition.

        pitfalls: [Mistaking gradual drift for a phase transition, insufficient Γ ramp rate to trigger the bifurcation cleanly]

    excerpt: |
      "Heat," in the Pirouette Framework, is the felt experience of a localized, extreme Temporal Pressure (Γ)—the roar of the Temporal Forge (CORE-003) made manifest. It is a crucible, a state of intense temporal dissonance that serves as both trial and midwife. A system subjected to this ordeal must either find a new, more resilient way to be, or dissolve back into the chaotic hum of potential.
  - module: DOMA-005
    excerpt: |
      As ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) intensifies, there comes a moment where a system's existing resonant pattern (Ki) is no longer a viable solution. The cost of maintaining its current form becomes unsustainable. This is the moment of irreversible bifurcation, the "do-not-return line" we call Sigma (Σ).

        The process directly maps to thermal annealing, where heat (high Γ) provides the energy for a system (e.g., a crystal lattice) to overcome local energy barriers, explore new configurations, and settle into a more stable, lower-energy state (a new Ki). The Σ point is analogous to the critical temperature for a phase transition.

# Ordeal of Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The process by which a system, subjected to intense and rising local Temporal Pressure (Γ), is driven to an irreversible bifurcation point (Σ). At this point, the system's existing resonant pattern (Ki) becomes untenable. It is forced to either dissolve into incoherence or undergo Ki Morphogenesis, discovering and stabilizing a new Ki that maximizes coherence under the new, high-Γ conditions, emerging tempered and more resilient.

## EFT-First Summary
The Ordeal of Coherence is conceptually analogous to a second-order phase transition or thermal annealing process in condensed matter physics. A system subjected to extreme environmental energy ("heat," mapped to Temporal Pressure Γ) is forced out of a metastable state. It must either "melt" (dissolve) or recrystallize into a new, more robust configuration (Ki Morphogenesis) that is stable at the higher energy level. The process is a non-equilibrium, irreversible transition to a state of higher structural integrity.
