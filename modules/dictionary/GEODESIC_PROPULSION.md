      snippet: |
        In the Pirouette framework, thrust is the consequence of a system following its geodesic through a contoured landscape. The Vorticycle's genius is that it actively contours its own local landscape.

  art: |
    A surfer who does not seek a wave, but instead whispers one into existence beneath their feet, then rides its crest perpetually. Motion is not a struggle against the sea, but the art of teaching it a new shape.
  law: |
    Propulsion is the result of a system perpetually following a geodesic it actively engineers in its own local coherence manifold. The propulsive force is proportional to the gradient of the system's Pirouette Lagrangian, `F ‚àù ‚àáùìõ_p`, generated by creating and sustaining an asymmetric potential `V_Œì`.
  philosophy: |
    Motion is not a battle against an external reality, but an act of internal re-orchestration. To move is to create a slope within one's own being and have the courage to slide down it. The universe does not give way to force; it yields to a more beautiful song.
pirouette_definition: |
  The principle of motion by actively and continuously engineering the local coherence manifold to create an asymmetric gradient, or "slope." The system then naturally follows this self-generated path of least resistance‚Äîits new geodesic‚Äîresulting in sustained, "reactionless" thrust. This is an autopoietic process where the act of moving and the creation of the path for movement are a single, self-referential dynamic.
operational_definition:
  units: The output is a force (Newtons), derived from gradients in the Pirouette Lagrangian (Joules).

      - name: Null-Ejecta Thrust Test
        outline: |
          A device is placed on a high-sensitivity thrust stand within a sealed vacuum chamber instrumented to detect any mass or energy expulsion. The device is activated, and the thrust measurement is correlated with power consumption and the output of a downstream Wound Channel sensor array. Geodesic propulsion is confirmed if non-zero thrust is measured without any corresponding mass/energy ejecta, and a Chiral Wound Channel is detected.
        expected_signals: [Thrust stand displacement, helical signal from Wound Channel sensor array, absence of particle/radiation detection]
        pitfalls: [Failing to account for subtle energy dissipation (e.g., thermal radiation), misinterpreting sensor noise as a Wound Channel signal]

  - module: DOMA-196
    excerpt: |
      The device achieves "reactionless" motion not by expelling mass, but by actively sculpting the local coherence manifold into a slope, which it then ceaselessly descends. It creates its own "downhill" path in spacetime‚Äîa geodesic of its own design‚Äîand then simply follows the path of least resistance. It does not power through the wave; it generates the wave and then surfs it.
  - module: DOMA-196
    excerpt: |
      The objective reality is that the device is perpetually falling along a geodesic that it is perpetually creating just ahead of itself. The helical nature of the channel is key. The thrust is a continuous interaction between the device and the immediate geometry of the channel it is actively creating. It is analogous to a screw biting into wood, with the profound difference that the screw is simultaneously creating the wood grain it grips.

      justification: |
        Both concepts involve actively manipulating spacetime geometry to facilitate motion. While the Alcubierre drive proposes contracting space ahead and expanding it behind, Geodesic Propulsion proposes creating a local gradient in a related manifold. Both are "subluminal" applications that engineer a path rather than traversing it via brute force.

    - target: Geodesic equation in General Relativity
      rationale: |
        The core concept of "following a path of least resistance" is a direct mapping to motion along a geodesic in GR. The novel contribution of the Pirouette framework is the proposed physical mechanism for *actively and locally determining the geometry* of that geodesic, which is outside standard GR. This mapping is adopted for its conceptual clarity, not its mathematical equivalence.

  disambiguation: |
    Geodesic Propulsion should be distinguished from conventional Reaction Propulsion. Reaction Propulsion acts by pushing against an expelled mass (e.g., rocket exhaust) or an external medium (e.g., air, water). Geodesic Propulsion acts by reconfiguring the local "terrain" of the coherence manifold and then passively moving along the newly formed path of least resistance.
