  art: |
    To be isochronous is to cease swimming against the river of time and become a dancer moving in perfect harmony with its current. It is the sublime feeling of being perfectly on beat with the universe.
  law: |
    A state of maximal coherence and energetic efficiency is achieved when the rate of temporal information presented by the environment (`ΔT_env`) equals the agent's maximum bandwidth for processing that information (`ΔT_agent`). Any deviation from this equilibrium (`ΔT_env ≠ ΔT_agent`) increases energetic cost and reduces coherence.
  philosophy: |
    Isochronism reframes the psychological state of 'flow' as a fundamental, physical process of temporal resonance. This makes optimal performance a diagnosable and engineerable condition of alignment between a system and its environment, not an esoteric or accidental state of mind. It is the target state for any action aiming for effortless mastery.
pirouette_definition: |
  A state of autopoietic temporal resonance where the rate of environmental temporal information (`ΔT_env`) perfectly matches an agent's coherent processing bandwidth (`ΔT_agent`). This equilibrium, `ΔT_env = ΔT_agent`, minimizes the temporal phase difference between agent and environment (`Δτ ≈ 0`), resulting in a near-lossless information cycle subjectively experienced as Flow. It is the direct phenomenological consequence of satisfying the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

        outline: |
          1.  Select a task where the rate of temporal information (`ΔT_env`) can be precisely and continuously modulated (e.g., adaptive video game, variable-speed data feed).
          2.  Calibrate the agent's baseline `ΔT_agent` by gradually increasing `ΔT_env` from a low value.
          3.  Simultaneously measure performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, reaction time) and biometric proxies for Coherence Flux (`Φ_C`), such as heart-rate variability (HRV) and EEG synchrony.
          4.  The state of Isochronism is identified as the point where performance is maximal while biometric indicators of stress are minimal. The value of `ΔT_env` at this peak is the measured `ΔT_agent`.
        expected_signals: [Maximal task performance, Maximal `Φ_C`, high HRV, high alpha/theta-band EEG synchrony]
        pitfalls: [Agent fatigue confounding results, inaccurate quantification of `ΔT_env`, latency in biometric feedback]

    excerpt: |
      The celebrated “challenge-skill” balance of Flow is the macroscopic experience of achieving equilibrium with the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). The old model's `Γ-Equilibrium` is now understood as a perfect matching of temporal information rates. Challenge is not an abstract property of a task, but the rate and dissonance of temporal information the environment presents. Skill is the agent's capacity to process that information coherently.

    excerpt: |
      Flow is the most efficient metabolic state in the framework. Perfect temporal resonance (`Δτ ≈ 0`) maximizes the system's ability to process reality without internal friction, creating a self-reinforcing loop of coherence and satisfying the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The subjective feeling of "effortlessness" is the direct experience of a near-lossless energetic cycle, where the act of perception seamlessly fuels the act of creation.

        Isochronism ≈ Operating at `C = max I(X;Y)`
      justification: |
        Isochronism describes a state where an agent (receiver) perfectly processes information from its environment (source) at the maximum rate possible without being overwhelmed by noise or error. This is conceptually parallel to a communication channel operating at its Shannon capacity, the theoretical upper bound on the rate at which information can be reliably transmitted.

  disambiguation: |
    While both terms share the Greek roots for "equal time" (iso-chronos), Pirouette's Isochronism refers to the matching of *information rates* between a system and its environment, not the constant *period* of a mechanical oscillation. It is a resonance in the temporal information domain.
