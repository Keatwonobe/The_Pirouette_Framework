        This crucible models the possibility of **deliberately inducing interruptive-adaptive cognition**—the cognitive plasticity born of internal fragmentation—**without the originating trauma**.

triad:
  art: |
    A mind shattered like a mirror, yet each shard reflects a unique angle of the whole truth. The fragments assemble not into their original form, but a new, more resilient mosaic capable of capturing lightning.
  law: |
    The rate of novel insight synthesis ($\dot{I}$) is proportional to the induced rate of recoverable internal fragmentation ($\dot{Ψ_f}$), up to a critical threshold determined by the subject's recovery protocol efficacy. Beyond this threshold, induced fragmentation leads to decoherence and performance collapse.
  philosophy: |
    True resilience is not the inability to be broken, but the practiced art of reassembling one's own fragments into a stronger, more adaptive whole. By simulating chaos internally, we inoculate the mind against external decoherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  A trainable cognitive state characterized by deliberately induced, recoverable disruptions to linear thought patterns. Internal Fragmentation is not a pathology but a controlled process for cultivating cognitive plasticity, resilience to informational shock, and the ability to synthesize novel insights from disordered inputs. It is the core dynamic simulated in the Weaver Crucible (XCM-001).
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless, or as a rate (interrupts/sec)
  symbol_table:
    - name: Ψ_f
      meaning: Index of Internal Fragmentation, representing the degree of non-linear, disrupted thought within a cognitive task cycle.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "[0, 1], where 0 is perfect linear coherence and 1 is total decoherence."

      - name: Cognitive Chirp Response Latency
        outline: |
          A subject performs a baseline cognitive task. At stochastic intervals, a 'cognitive chirp' (an unrelated, brief, demanding micro-task) is introduced. Measure the latency and accuracy of re-engaging with the primary task. Higher fragmentation is inferred from longer re-engagement latencies but may correlate with higher creativity in multi-solution problems.
        expected_signals: [Task re-engagement latency (s), Task resumption accuracy (%), Number of generated solutions]
        pitfalls: [Subject habituation to chirps, Confounding with general attention fatigue, Difficulty distinguishing adaptive fragmentation from simple distraction]
context_windows:
  - module: XCM-001
    excerpt: |
      Interruptive cognition arises as a **compensatory adaptation** in high-disruption minds. However, certain **non-destructive training environments** may simulate the benefits of such disruption if: the disruptions are patterned, intentional, and recoverable; the subject is taught to **synthesize fragmented thought states** into insight paths.
  - module: XCM-001
    excerpt: |
      We hypothesize that a group trained using this method... Adapts quickly to fractured input domains (multi-agent, multi-signal), can maintain multi-phase attention and resolve contradictions quickly, [and] develops resilience to decoherence attacks (propaganda, attention fragmentation).

      equation_hint: |
        Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) as a non-monotonic function of noise level.
      justification: |
        The framework posits that induced, non-destructive cognitive "noise" (interruptions) can enhance cognitive performance (insight synthesis), analogous to how an optimal level of physical noise can enhance signal detection in a non-linear system. The key insight is that zero disruption is suboptimal for certain complex tasks.

  claims:
    - statement: "Training with patterned, recoverable cognitive disruptions (per XCM-001) increases a subject's task-switching performance ($T_a$) and problem-solving creativity under high-stochasticity conditions more effectively than standard linear training."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "A controlled experiment shows no significant performance difference between the XCM-001 group and a control group, or the XCM-001 group exhibits higher cognitive fatigue and burnout with no offsetting performance benefit."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [Internal fragmentation (computer science)]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'internal fragmentation' in computer memory management, which refers to wasted space within allocated memory blocks. In Pirouette, it refers to a dynamic, trainable cognitive state, not a resource allocation inefficiency.
