        This module offers a **certificate of translation**: here is how Pirouette’s Γ, Kτ, Tₐ align with established metrics and guidelines in cardiac rehab, post-valve care, and risk management.

triad:
  art: |
    A diplomatic credential presented to an established culture, showing that a new language respects its grammar and seeks only to extend its poetry.
  law: |
    Any novel Pirouette concept introduced into a regulated domain must be accompanied by a formal mapping to that domain's accepted standards, metrics, and safety protocols, with all divergences explicitly justified.
  philosophy: |
    To innovate responsibly, one must first demonstrate fluency in the established language of a domain. The certificate is not an appeal to authority, but a gesture of respect that makes critique and collaboration possible.
pirouette_definition: |
  A formal module that explicitly maps Pirouette's concepts, variables, and phases (e.g., Γ, Kτ, Re-Tune) to the established standards, metrics, and protocols of a specific professional domain (e.g., clinical cardiac rehabilitation). Its purpose is to facilitate review, critique, adaptation, or adoption by domain practitioners by demonstrating conceptual alignment and highlighting intentional divergences.

      - name: SME Compliance Audit
        outline: |
          A subject matter expert (SME) from the target domain evaluates the certificate by comparing its mappings against cited source standards (e.g., ACC/AHA guidelines). The audit scores the accuracy, completeness, and safety-consciousness of the proposed translations and justifications for divergence.
        expected_signals: [`High SME concordance ('>>80%') on mapping accuracy`, `Coverage of all critical safety protocols`, `Explicit justification for all conceptual divergences`]
        pitfalls: [`Using outdated or niche source standards`, `Superficial mapping that ignores deep conceptual conflicts`, `Failing to translate safety-critical constraints`]

    excerpt: |
      Many clinicians will dismiss “new” frameworks unless they see clear mapping to accepted standards. This module offers a **certificate of translation**: here is how Pirouette’s Γ, Kτ, Tₐ align with established metrics and guidelines in cardiac rehab, post-valve care, and risk management. It also highlights where Pirouette diverges (and why) — inviting critique rather than confrontation.
  - module: DOMA-HLTH-006
    excerpt: |
      This is a **translated overlay**, not a replacement of specialist judgement. ... Coherence metrics (Kτ) are not yet validated in large trials — they are design heuristics, not regulatory endpoints. Always adapt to local CR protocols, surgeon constraints, and institutional policies.

      justification: |
        The Certificate of Translation functions as a design pattern that allows the Pirouette framework's interface to be used by clients with a different, incompatible interface (i.e., established clinical practice). It wraps the novel Pirouette concepts in a layer that presents them in the familiar terms, phases, and metrics of the target domain, enabling interoperability without modifying the core systems on either side.

  claims:
    - statement: "A well-formed certificate of translation increases the rate of adoption of a Pirouette protocol by practitioners in the target domain by at least 25% compared to presenting the raw protocol."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "An A/B test is conducted with two cohorts of domain experts. Cohort A receives a raw Pirouette protocol; Cohort B receives the same protocol plus its certificate of translation. If Cohort B does not show a statistically significant increase in stated willingness to adopt or trial the protocol, the claim is falsified."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [`Legal "certificate of translation" (for documents)`]
  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, this term refers to a formal *module* or *report* for conceptual mapping, not a legally binding document for linguistic translation. It certifies intellectual alignment, not word-for-word accuracy.
