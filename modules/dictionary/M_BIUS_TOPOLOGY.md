        Spin as Topology: In this framework, spin is not an intrinsic property but an emergent, topological feature of a particle's stable resonance (Ki). For a particle to persist, its resonance must form a self-referential knot in the coherence manifold. The Principle of Maximal Coherence demands this knot adopt a maximally resilient form. This re-frames the "Ki constant" of PPS-033 not as a number, but as the signature of the fundamental Möbius topology (CORE-009) of a fermion. An electron must rotate 720° to return to its starting state, and this two-cycle nature is the geometric origin of its baseline g-factor of g=2.

    Spin is not an intrinsic property; it is the knot a resonance must tie in itself to keep from unraveling. It is a twist in the fabric of being that remembers its own journey.
  law: |
    A system possessing Möbius topology must undergo a 720° (4π radian) spatial rotation to return to its initial quantum state. This two-cycle geometric constraint dictates a baseline gyromagnetic ratio (g-factor) of exactly 2.
  philosophy: |
    This reframes the abstract quantum number 'spin' as a necessary and emergent geometric property. It replaces the postulate "fermions have spin-½" with the causal explanation "stable resonance requires a Möbius topology," grounding quantum statistics in physical geometry.

  The fundamental, emergent topological structure of a stable fermionic resonance (Ki). It is a self-referential, two-cycle knot in the coherence manifold that represents the maximally resilient form a resonance can take under the Principle of Maximal Coherence. This topology is the geometric origin of a fermion's 720° rotational symmetry (spin-½ behavior) and its baseline g-factor of 2.

        outline: |
          A beam of fermions (e.g., neutrons) is split into two paths in an interferometer. One path is subjected to a magnetic field that causes a precise 360° rotation of the particle's spin axis relative to the other path. The beams are then recombined to observe the interference pattern. The procedure is repeated for a 720° rotation.
        expected_signals:
          - Destructive interference (a π phase shift) for a 360° rotation, indicating the wavefunction has not returned to its original state.
          - Constructive interference (a 2π phase shift) for a 720° rotation, confirming the two-cycle nature of the topology.

        The defining mathematical property of a spinor in quantum mechanics is that it acquires a negative sign upon a 360° (2π) rotation and returns to its original state only after a 720° (4π) rotation. The Möbius topology is the Pirouette Framework's physical and geometric instantiation of this abstract mathematical behavior, providing a causal origin for the spinor's properties.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a classical Möbius strip, which is a 2D surface embedded in 3D space, the Möbius topology is a property of the particle's resonance path on the higher-dimensional coherence manifold. The name is an analogy for the 'twist' that results in a two-cycle path, not a literal geometric shape.

# Möbius Topology

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The fundamental, emergent topological structure of a stable fermionic resonance (Ki). It is a self-referential, two-cycle knot in the coherence manifold that represents the maximally resilient form a resonance can take under the Principle of Maximal Coherence. This topology is the geometric origin of a fermion's 720° rotational symmetry (spin-½ behavior) and its baseline g-factor of 2.

## EFT-First Summary
In standard quantum field theory, the 720° rotational symmetry of fermions is described mathematically by spinors, which are objects in the fundamental representation of the SU(2) group. The Pirouette Framework's Möbius topology provides a physical, geometric origin for this spinor behavior, identifying it as a necessary topological form for stable resonance on the coherence manifold. This directly yields the baseline g-factor of 2, which in QED is the tree-level contribution to the electron's magnetic moment.
