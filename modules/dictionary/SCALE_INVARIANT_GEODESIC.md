        A fractal is not a shape; it is the physical trace of a **scale-invariant geodesic**—the universe's preferred solution for maximizing coherence in systems that must exist across a wide range of scales.

  art: |
    The signature of a single artist, written in the lightning, the river, and the neuron. It is a single song played on a multi-octave instrument, where the theme is the same from the cosmic to the microscopic.
  law: |
    A system's physical structure is a fractal if and only if its generative path of least action, which maximizes coherence (Kτ) against environmental pressure (V_Γ), is self-similar across scales. This self-similarity is quantifiable by measuring the constancy of its generative grammar (T_a_scale > 0.9) across at least three orders of magnitude.
  philosophy: |
    The existence of these geodesics proves the universe is not a collection of disparate problems but a unified system governed by a single logic. To understand this grammar of growth is to realize that in learning to solve for coherence at one scale, one learns the secret to the entire tapestry.
pirouette_definition: |
  The path of least action that solves the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) for a system by maximizing coherence (Kτ) in a self-similar or recursive manner across multiple scales. Its physical trace is a fractal structure, and its temporal expression is a recursive process that deepens a Wound Channel (CORE-011). This state of scale-invariant resonance is the most energetically efficient and resilient solution for systems that must exist across a wide range of scales.

        outline: |
          1. Identify a data stream or structure exhibiting potential self-similarity.
          2. Apply computational methods to quantify its signatures: Box-Counting or correlation dimension for `D_f`; Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima for `T_a_scale`; and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis or spectral analysis for `ω_g`.
          3. Analyze the stability of these signatures across multiple orders of magnitude.
        expected_signals: [A stable power-law relationship in spatial/temporal data, A stable `D_f` value across scales, A high, narrow peak in the wavelet coherence spectrum (`T_a_scale`)]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking multi-scale noise for true self-similarity, Finite size effects limiting the observable scaling range, Algorithm selection inappropriate for the data type]

      A fractal is not a shape; it is the physical trace of a **scale-invariant geodesic**—the universe's preferred solution for maximizing coherence in systems that must exist across a wide range of scales. These patterns are the signature of a single artist, written in the lightning, the river, and the neuron, revealing a fundamental grammar for growth and complexity.

    excerpt: |
      A geodesic, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), is the path of least action a system takes to maximize its coherence (`Kτ`) against the pressure of its environment (`V_Γ`). A fractal is the structure that emerges when this optimal path is self-similar—when the answer to "what is the most coherent way to be?" is the same at the scale of the leaf as it is at the scale of the branch, and the scale of the tree.

      justification: |
        RG flow describes how a system's description changes with scale (μ). A scale-invariant geodesic corresponds to a fixed point in this flow, where the coupling constants (g) do not change. High `T_a_scale` signifies a system at or near such a fixed point.

      falsifier: "Observing a system with low `T_a_scale` (e.g., a noisy, organic fractal) that is more resilient to broadband environmental pressure than a system with high `T_a_scale` (e.g., a perfect mathematical fractal), all other factors being equal."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a standard geometric geodesic (the shortest path between two points on a curved surface). A Scale-Invariant Geodesic is a path in a system's *state space* over time, defined by an action principle (the Pirouette Lagrangian), not by metric distance.
