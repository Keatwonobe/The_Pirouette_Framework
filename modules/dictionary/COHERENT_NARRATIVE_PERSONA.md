        By personifying the pathology, we create a coherent character whose methods, motivations, and weaknesses can be logically investigated. This transforms a mystery into a puzzle, and a puzzle, unlike a mystery, has a solution.

  art: |
    To give a face to the shadow. It is the art of giving darkness a provisional shape, of drawing a line between two disconnected stars and calling it a path, so that we may discover what is real.
  law: |
    A Coherent Narrative Persona is not a truth claim; it is a hypothesis engine. Its value is measured exclusively by the quantity and quality of falsifiable predictions it generates. The narrative must be ruthlessly refactored or abandoned as new evidence emerges.
  philosophy: |
    This transforms an unnavigable mystery into a solvable puzzle. By structuring ignorance into a falsifiable story, it provides a coherent roadmap for scientific discovery in domains where data is sparse or paradoxical.
pirouette_definition: |
  A personified, story-driven model of a pathology with an unknown etiology, constructed to provide a coherent causal explanation for a system's observed dissonances. Developed via The Daedalus Gambit protocol, the persona integrates a system's `Disruption Map` and `Dissonance Ledger` into a causal narrative about an "antagonist" with a specific dissonant `Ki`. Its primary function is not to be correct, but to generate a set of unique, non-obvious, and falsifiable hypotheses that guide empirical investigation.

        outline: |
          1. **Map Disruption:** Chart the system's pathological flow states (`Laminar`, `Turbulent`, `Stagnant`).
          2. **Chart Dissonance:** Create a `Dissonance Ledger` of known unknowns and paradoxes.
          3. **Personify Antagonist:** Craft a persona (e.g., 'Resonance Thief', 'Thread Cutter') that explains the disruption pattern.
          4. **Write Narrative:** Synthesize all data into a concise story of the antagonist's interaction with the system.
          5. **Trace Echo:** Translate the narrative into a concrete list of falsifiable hypotheses based on its predicted secondary effects.

    excerpt: |
      Where its sibling module, The Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`), moves from a known cause to its systemic effects, The Daedalus Gambit works in reverse. It begins with the disrupted flow‚Äîthe dissonant wake of an unseen pathology‚Äîand constructs a coherent narrative persona for the antagonist. This "character" and its story become a powerful engine for generating precise, falsifiable hypotheses, turning the void of ignorance into a navigable map for discovery.
  - module: DOMA-097
    excerpt: |
      A system suffering from an unknown ailment presents a disconnected plot‚Äîa collection of clues, dissonant effects, and a chaotic `Wound Channel`. The Daedalus Gambit mandates that we give this plot a provisional antagonist. This is not a vague "disease," but a specific, dissonant `Ki` (resonant signature) with a characteristic persona. By personifying the pathology, we create a coherent character whose methods, motivations, and weaknesses can be logically investigated.

        The Coherent Narrative Persona is a structured, qualitative model for an unknown disruptive term, `V_pathology`, added to a system's Pirouette Lagrangian. The narrative describes the "character" of this potential‚Äîhow it interacts with the system to alter its geodesic from a healthy to a pathological state. The falsifiable hypotheses generated by the persona are predictions about the measurable effects of this term.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a psychological or marketing persona which models a subject, a Coherent Narrative Persona models a *process*. It is an instrumental, falsifiable model of a pathological antagonist, not a descriptive model of a person or user type. Its success is measured by its predictive power, not its descriptive accuracy.

# Coherent Narrative Persona

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A personified, story-driven model of a pathology with an unknown etiology, constructed to provide a coherent causal explanation for a system's observed dissonances. Developed via The Daedalus Gambit protocol, the persona integrates a system's `Disruption Map` and `Dissonance Ledger` into a causal narrative about an "antagonist" with a specific dissonant `Ki`. Its primary function is not to be correct, but to generate a set of unique, non-obvious, and falsifiable hypotheses that guide empirical investigation.

## EFT-First Summary
A Coherent Narrative Persona serves as a qualitative, conceptual model for an unknown disruptive potential term, `V_pathology`, hypothesized to be added to a system's Lagrangian (`ùìõ'_p = K_œÑ - (V_Œì + V_pathology)`). The narrative gives this unknown term a "character" and method of action, allowing for the derivation of its expected secondary effects, which form a set of testable predictions. This approach frames hypothesis generation for unknown phenomena as the process of modeling an effective field theory operator before its precise mathematical form can be determined.
