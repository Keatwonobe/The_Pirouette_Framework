    A single note, struck once at the dawn of inquiry, whose echoes define the harmony of all subsequent measurement. The universe holds its breath, and we measure the silence that follows. This first truth is the only one given freely; all others must be derived from it.
  law: |
    Fix a single global scale, u_*, from one and only one high-precision observable. This act freezes all fundamental dimensionless parameters of the framework (e.g., U, T from MATH-018 D3). All other calculations are thereafter parameter-free, out-of-sample predictions.
  philosophy: |
    To ensure the framework's predictive power is not diluted by continuous re-fitting, Anchoring enforces a strict separation between calibration and prediction. By tying the entire theoretical structure to a single measurement, it posits that the system's fundamental constants are not dials to be tuned, but fixed features of a coherent reality, knowable from one well-chosen perspective.
pirouette_definition: |
  A methodological principle requiring that a single global coherence scale, `u_*`, be fixed exactly once from a high-precision measurement. This "one-shot" calibration act, or Anchoring, permanently freezes all fundamental dimensionless parameters of the theory, as specified in MATH-018 D3. Consequently, all subsequent calculations of physical observables are strictly out-of-sample predictions, with no remaining free parameters to adjust.

        outline: |
          1. Select a single, high-precision, theoretically clean observable (e.g., the electron anomalous magnetic moment, `a_e`).
          2. Calculate the Pirouette prediction for this observable as a function of the free scale `u_*`.
          3. Invert the relation to fix the value of `u_*` such that the calculation exactly matches the central experimental value.
          4. This value of `u_*` is now the permanent anchor for all subsequent predictions.
        expected_signals:
          - A unique, stable value for u_*.
          - All other observables calculated with this u_* must fall within their experimental uncertainty bands.
        pitfalls:
          - The chosen anchor observable might have unknown systematic errors or be theoretically "dirty" due to non-Pirouette physics.
          - A poor choice of anchor could invalidate all subsequent predictions, leading to a premature falsification of the framework.

      Constraint D3: Parameter Lock. The theory's fundamental dimensionless constants, collectively denoted by the set U, and the global topological index T, are not free-floating. They are functions of a single, undetermined energy scale, `u_*`, with functional forms fixed by the RG flow equations. To render the theory predictive, `u_*` must be fixed externally by a single measurement, an act we call Anchoring.

        Similar to fixing the value of a coupling like `α_s` at a specific scale (e.g., `M_Z`), which then determines its value at all other scales via the RG equation. Pirouette's Anchoring generalizes this by claiming to fix *all* fundamental dimensionless parameters from a single input measurement, a much stronger assertion.

    In Pirouette, 'Boundary Data & Anchoring' does not refer to initial conditions for dynamical evolution in time (as in GR's Cauchy problem). It refers to the one-time, global fixing of the theory's fundamental parameters using a single experimental measurement as a boundary condition on the theory space itself.

# Boundary Data & Anchoring

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A methodological principle requiring that a single global coherence scale, `u_*`, be fixed exactly once from a high-precision measurement. This "one-shot" calibration act, or Anchoring, permanently freezes all fundamental dimensionless parameters of the theory, as specified in MATH-018 D3. Consequently, all subsequent calculations of physical observables are strictly out-of-sample predictions, with no remaining free parameters to adjust.

## EFT-First Summary
The Anchoring principle is analogous to fixing a renormalization scale in Quantum Field Theory. Just as measuring the strong coupling `α_s` at the Z-boson mass `M_Z` allows the running coupling to be predicted at all other energy scales, Anchoring uses one high-precision measurement (e.g., the electron's anomalous magnetic moment) to fix a single global scale `u_*`. This act uniquely determines all of the framework's dimensionless parameters, turning all other calculations into parameter-free predictions.
