  art: |
    Healing is not a return but a recomposition. Laminar Certification is the moment flow is restored—when the twin serpents of Body and Will, once knotted in trauma, finally glide in synchronized rhythm. It is the quiet hum of a system re-tuned to its own purpose.
  law: |
    A state is certified as laminar when Temporal Pressure (Γ) remains below 0.3 and Time Adherence (Tₐ) remains at or above 0.8 for a continuous period of at least four weeks. This state must be verified by both objective physiological markers and subjective Will coherence statements.
  philosophy: |
    Laminar Certification signifies the restoration of sovereignty. It marks the transition from a life defined by the constraints of trauma to one defined by the creative expression of Will, demonstrating that structured pressure, when paired with purpose, can reconstitute a coherent self.
pirouette_definition: |
  The formally defined state of successful rehabilitation within the Caduceus Lens Protocol, achieved when an individual demonstrates sustained low Temporal Pressure (Γ < 0.3) and high Time Adherence (Tₐ ≥ 0.8) for a minimum of four weeks. This state indicates a stable, autonomous system where physiological function (Body蛇) and intentional purpose (Will蛇) have re-aligned into a coherent, self-regulating flow.

          1. Continuously monitor Γ (derived from physiological, environmental, and medication load stressors) and Tₐ (derived from adherence to prescribed rituals and activities).
          2. Establish a 4-week moving window for analysis.
          3. If for the entire window Γ has not exceeded 0.3 and Tₐ has not dropped below 0.8, certify the state as laminar.
          4. Corroborate with narrative analysis of Will statements, checking for a shift from avoidance to creation framing.

        Laminar Certification represents a new, stable homeostatic set-point post-trauma or disease. It is not a return to the prior state but the establishment of a new, functional equilibrium that can withstand minor perturbations.

        Operationally, it functions like a declaration of remission. It is a durational, criteria-based assessment that a pathological process (high Γ) has subsided to a sub-clinical, manageable level, allowing for autonomous function.

  disambiguation: |
    While borrowing the "laminar" metaphor from fluid dynamics to evoke smooth, non-turbulent flow, this term refers specifically to a psycho-physiological state of coherent rehabilitation, not the movement of a physical fluid. The key is the lack of internal 'turbulence' (high Γ).

# Laminar Certification

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The formally defined state of successful rehabilitation within the Caduceus Lens Protocol, achieved when an individual demonstrates sustained low Temporal Pressure (Γ < 0.3) and high Time Adherence (Tₐ ≥ 0.8) for a minimum of four weeks. This state indicates a stable, autonomous system where physiological function (Body蛇) and intentional purpose (Will蛇) have re-aligned into a coherent, self-regulating flow.

## EFT-First Summary
Laminar Certification is an operational state analogous to achieving a new homeostatic set-point or clinical remission. It is defined by criteria where systemic stress (Temporal Pressure Γ) is sustainably low and behavioral consistency (Time Adherence Tₐ) is high. This signifies a transition from a managed recovery process to a state of autonomous, resilient function.
