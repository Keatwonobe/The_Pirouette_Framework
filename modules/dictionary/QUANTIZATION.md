        The existence of a closed, resonant boundary naturally and inevitably leads to quantization. Within the arena of the Shell, only certain standing-wave patterns can persist. Any `Ki` that is not a stable harmonic of the resonant cavity will quickly destroy itself through destructive interference.

  art: |
    A violin string can only play certain notes. A Shell is the universe's violin, and its quantized states are the notes it is allowed to sing into existence.
  law: |
    For any system enclosed by a Shell, the set of stable internal `Ki` patterns is discrete, corresponding to the standing-wave harmonics of the Shell's geometry. Non-harmonic patterns are suppressed via destructive interference on a timescale proportional to the Shell's coherence (`K_τ`).
  philosophy: |
    Quantization is not an arbitrary rule imposed on reality, but an inevitable consequence of self-containment. It is how the universe creates definite 'things' with stable identities from an underlying continuum of potential.
pirouette_definition: |
  The emergent process by which a Shell, acting as a resonant cavity, restricts the continuous spectrum of a system's potential internal states (`Ki`) to a discrete set of stable, allowed harmonics. These standing-wave patterns are the only configurations that can persist within the boundary without being extinguished by destructive interference, thereby defining the system's quantum states.

        outline: |
          Excite a shelled system with a broadband `Ki` source. Measure the response spectrum of the system's internal state using a sensitive probe. The resulting power spectrum will show sharp peaks only at discrete frequencies/modes corresponding to the allowed harmonics of the Shell geometry.
        expected_signals: [Discrete power spectrum with sharp resonant peaks, rapid decay of off-peak frequency components]
        pitfalls: [Low signal-to-noise ratio obscuring higher-order harmonics, shell permeability dampening the response and broadening peaks]

    excerpt: |
      The existence of a closed, resonant boundary naturally and inevitably leads to quantization. Within the arena of the Shell, only certain standing-wave patterns can persist. Any `Ki` that is not a stable harmonic of the resonant cavity will quickly destroy itself through destructive interference. These stable harmonics are the system's allowed quantum states. The Shell, therefore, acts as the universe's primary mechanism for "digitizing" the continuum.
  - module: DOMA-059
    excerpt: |
      A Shell is not a static wall, but a dynamic, self-maintaining coherence manifold—a standing wave of self-preservation held in place by the feedback loop of the Gladiator Force. This self-sustaining boundary is the physical basis of identity. It separates a coherent "inside" from the chaotic "outside," acts as a resonant cavity that quantizes the system's internal states, and defines the rules of engagement with the world.

      justification: |
        The Pirouette model describes quantization as a direct result of boundary conditions imposed by a resonant cavity (the Shell). This is conceptually and mathematically identical to the textbook 'particle in a box' problem in quantum mechanics, where imposing rigid boundary conditions on the wavefunction solution to the Schrödinger equation results in a discrete spectrum of allowed energy eigenvalues.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the 'quantization' used in digital signal processing, which refers to the engineered approximation of a continuous signal by a discrete set of values. Pirouette's Quantization is an emergent physical phenomenon, not an engineered algorithm. It is also distinct from the field-theoretic concept of "second quantization."
