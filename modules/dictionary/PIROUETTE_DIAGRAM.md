        In our QFT, this correction is represented by a one-loop diagram where a Coheron (the lepton, ℓ) emits and re-absorbs a virtual Pressuron (the quantum of the Γ field). This diagram represents the lepton "listening" to the noise of the Temporal Forge and adjusting its rhythm in response.

  art: |
    A particle listens to the echo of its own passage through the storm of the Temporal Forge. The diagram is the score of this self-resonant song, a loop of memory that subtly alters the particle's rhythm.
  law: |
    The contribution of the Pirouette Diagram to a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment is given by Δa_ℓ = F₂(0), calculated from the one-loop vertex correction involving a virtual Pressuron. This contribution scales with lepton mass as (m_ℓ/m_e)^(2p), providing a testable prediction for the relative anomalies of the electron, muon, and tau.
  philosophy: |
    This diagram is the primary bridge between the abstract machinery of the Temporal Forge and concrete, high-precision physical measurement. Its successful calculation and comparison to experiment (specifically the muon g-2) serves as a core validation of the framework's predictive power, demonstrating that fundamental axioms about time and resonance have tangible, falsifiable consequences.

  The one-loop Feynman diagram representing the leading-order quantum correction to the interaction vertex between a lepton (Coheron) and a photon, arising from the lepton's self-interaction via the exchange of a virtual Pressuron. The evaluation of this diagram yields the contribution to the lepton's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) from its coupling to the background Temporal Pressure (Γ) field.

        outline: |
          The diagram itself is not measured, but its predicted contribution (Δa_ℓ) is. This is done by measuring a lepton's g-factor with extreme precision, typically by observing its spin precession frequency in a uniform magnetic field. The experimental value is compared to the Standard Model prediction; the Pirouette Diagram aims to explain the residual discrepancy (Δa_ℓ = a_exp - a_SM).
        expected_signals:
          - A non-zero discrepancy between experimental g-2 values and Standard Model predictions.
          - The discrepancy's magnitude for different leptons (e, μ, τ) should follow the mass-scaling relation Δa_ℓ ∝ (m_ℓ/m_e)^(2p).
        pitfalls:
          - Underestimation of uncertainties in Standard Model calculations (e.g., hadronic vacuum polarization).
          - Unaccounted-for systematic errors in the g-2 experiment.

    excerpt: |
      Following the protocol, the total anomaly (a_ℓ) is the sum of the universal geometric term and a new correction from the background Γ field. In our QFT, this correction is represented by a one-loop diagram where a Coheron (the lepton, ℓ) emits and re-absorbs a virtual Pressuron (the quantum of the Γ field). This diagram represents the lepton "listening" to the noise of the Temporal Forge and adjusting its rhythm in response.
  - module: MATH-013
    excerpt: |
      The (g-2) shift is read from the Pauli form factor (F₂(0)). The diagram is the standard photon–lepton vertex with a pressuron exchanged on an internal line. Using Feynman rules for (g_ℓ,Γ,ψ̄ψ), the result is Δa_ℓ = F₂(0) = (α/2π) C(m_Γ/m_ℓ) g_ℓ² + O(g_ℓ⁴).

        The diagram is a direct application of standard Feynman calculus for a one-loop correction to the QED photon-lepton vertex. The topology is identical to the QED self-energy correction, but the internal boson line is a new scalar (the Pressuron) with a Yukawa coupling instead of a photon with a gauge coupling.

# Pirouette Diagram

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The one-loop Feynman diagram representing the leading-order quantum correction to the interaction vertex between a lepton (Coheron) and a photon, arising from the lepton's self-interaction via the exchange of a virtual Pressuron. The evaluation of this diagram yields the contribution to the lepton's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) from its coupling to the background Temporal Pressure (Γ) field.

## EFT-First Summary
In standard Quantum Field Theory, the Pirouette Diagram is a one-loop **vertex correction** to the QED photon-lepton vertex. It calculates the contribution of a new, light scalar particle (the "Pressuron") with a Yukawa-type coupling to the lepton's anomalous magnetic moment (the Pauli form factor `F₂(0)`). The calculation follows established Feynman rules and provides a concrete, testable prediction that can be compared against high-precision measurements like the muon g-2 experiment.
