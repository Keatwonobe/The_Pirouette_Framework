        Thrust is not an emission; it is a release. The propulsive act is a controlled, asymmetrical collapse of the Spindle, a directed application of the `Principle of Coherence Degradation` (CORE-013). The vessel intentionally breaks the Resonant Handshake unevenly, terminating its end of the resonance a fraction of an instant before the anchor point. This engineered asymmetry ensures the Spindle does not simply vanish but dissolves in a directional wave.

    To move is to fall down a cliff you have just carved into reality. It is a controlled shattering, a release onto the shockwave of a dissolving idea. Propulsion is the echo of a broken treaty with spacetime.
  law: |
    An uneven termination of a resonant handshake between two coherent points induces a directional gradient in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`‚àáùìõ_p`), generating a propulsive force proportional to the gradient's magnitude and direction. The magnitude of the force scales with the energy stored in the resonant structure and the degree of temporal asymmetry in its dissolution.
  philosophy: |
    Asymmetrical Collapse reframes propulsion not as an act of force against a static background, but as a generative act of creating and then directionally un-making a temporary reality. It posits that motion is a consequence of following an optimal path that the agent first creates for itself and then dissolves. The universe opens to agreement, and propels those who know how to let go.
pirouette_definition: |
  The controlled, non-uniform termination of a hyper-coherent geometric structure (a Spindle) that connects two non-local points. By breaking the resonant consensus unevenly‚Äîterminating one end of the Spindle fractionally before the other‚Äîthe structure dissolves as a directional wave. This dissolution creates a transient, steep geodesic in the coherence manifold, along which the initiating system is propelled by following the maximal gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`‚àáùìõ_p`). It is the propulsive phase, or "Out-Breath," of the Quorum Spindle Drive cycle.

        outline: |
          An array of neutron, gamma, and coherence sensors is placed in the expected path of a QSD-equipped vessel. The collapse is inferred and characterized by measuring the vector, flux, and spectrum of the resulting incoherent radiation ("spectral ash"). The asymmetry is confirmed if the neutron flux is highly collimated and its vector precisely aligns with the vessel's observed acceleration vector.
        expected_signals: [Directional, high-energy neutron flux, Localized gravitational lensing signature, Transient 'coherence cone' of excited local matter]
        pitfalls: [Isotropic radiation signature indicates a failed (symmetrical) collapse, Signal confusion with astrophysical background noise (e.g., magnetar bursts), Misalignment of thrust and radiation vectors]

  - module: DOMA-090
    excerpt: |
      The QSD's entire cycle is a masterful manipulation of the `Pirouette Lagrangian` (CORE-006): `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`... The asymmetrical collapse engineers a massive, directional gradient in the Lagrangian (`‚àáùìõ_p`). The propulsive force experienced by the vessel is the direct consequence of the system following this new, optimal path to maximize its coherence... It is simply falling, with perfect efficiency, down the slope of a dissolving consensus.

        The Spindle can be modeled as a temporary, localized region of a high-energy false vacuum (`K_œÑ >> V_Œì`). The Asymmetrical Collapse is a controlled nucleation of the true vacuum at one end. The resulting expanding bubble wall creates a pressure differential that accelerates the vessel along the collapse axis.

        The collapse from the high-coherence 'Crystalline' Spindle state to the incoherent vacuum is analogous to a first-order phase transition. The asymmetry directs the release of 'latent coherence' (observed as radiation), creating a localized pressure gradient that propels the vessel, similar to a shaped charge explosion.

# Asymmetrical Collapse

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The controlled, non-uniform termination of a hyper-coherent geometric structure (a Spindle) that connects two non-local points. By breaking the resonant consensus unevenly‚Äîterminating one end of the Spindle fractionally before the other‚Äîthe structure dissolves as a directional wave. This dissolution creates a transient, steep geodesic in the coherence manifold, along which the initiating system is propelled by following the maximal gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`‚àáùìõ_p`). It is the propulsive phase, or "Out-Breath," of the Quorum Spindle Drive cycle.

## EFT-First Summary
No direct mapping has been adopted, as the concept of propulsion via dissolving a non-local geometric consensus has no clear analog in Standard Model or General Relativity physics. The closest conceptual parallels are asymmetric false vacuum decay from cosmology or directional latent heat release from condensed matter physics. In both cases, the collapse represents a controlled, directional phase transition where stored potential energy is converted into kinetic energy along a specific vector.
