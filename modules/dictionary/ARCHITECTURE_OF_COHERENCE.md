        A system's structure is not its static arrangement of parts, but the persistent, standing wave of coherence that flows through it. This wave is sustained by a deeply carved Ki pattern—its chosen architecture.

  art: |
    A cathedral is not a collection of rocks, but a memory of successful resonance written in stone. An architecture of coherence is this slow dance of form and pressure, a riverbed carved to guide the flow of being.
  law: |
    A system's resilience is proportional to its architecture's ability to maintain laminar coherence flow (`DYNA-001`) across its defined channels under ambient and acute Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). Structural failure is a Lagrangian event occurring when `V_Γ` locally exceeds a component's Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`).
  philosophy: |
    To build something that lasts is not to defy time, but to learn its rhythm. An architecture of coherence is the craft of creating forms—institutions, theories, relationships—that enable a more coherent future to flow into existence.
pirouette_definition: |
  An Architecture of Coherence is the persistent, resonant geometric pattern (`Ki` pattern) of a system that creates stable channels, or geodesics, for the flow of coherence (e.g., energy, information, physical load). It is a dynamic, time-first view of structure, where form is defined not by static components but by its function in guiding flow and resolving Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) into a state of maximal coherence.

      The "strongest" design is not the one with the most material, but the one that offers the path of least resistance for the pressures it is designed to channel. It is a geometry of grace, an architecture that makes stability the most energetically favorable state.

        A crystal lattice is a minimum-energy, persistent geometric arrangement of atoms that creates stable channels (phononic and electronic band structures) for the flow of energy and charge. Pathologies like vacancies (Atrophy), thermal noise (Fever), and dislocations (Erosion) map directly to the Pirouette failure modes.

# Architecture of Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An Architecture of Coherence is the persistent, resonant geometric pattern (`Ki` pattern) of a system that creates stable channels, or geodesics, for the flow of coherence (e.g., energy, information, physical load). It is a dynamic, time-first view of structure, where form is defined not by static components but by its function in guiding flow and resolving Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) into a state of maximal coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, the Architecture of Coherence maps to stable, minimum-energy configurations in physical systems, such as a crystal lattice in condensed matter. The lattice's geometry dictates the allowed pathways for energy and charge (phonons, electrons), just as a system's architecture channels coherence. This analogy provides a concrete model for understanding structural pathologies: lattice vacancies act as blockages (Atrophy), thermal vibrations as turbulence (Fever), and dislocations as a decay of form (Erosion).
