  art: |
    To perceive a system not as a static object, but as a living song striving for harmony against a backdrop of noise. It is the art of hearing the verb within the noun.
  law: |
    Any persistent system will evolve along the trajectory that maximizes its net temporal coherence (L_p), defined as its internal resonant power (K_Ï„) minus the coherence cost imposed by its environment (V_Î“).
  philosophy: |
    The lens reframes analysis from a static inventory of components to a dynamic diagnosis of a system's health. Its purpose is to shift the analyst's role from a spectator to a "physician of flow," identifying and resolving the sources of systemic discord.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Autopoietic Lens is the primary analytical framework of the Pirouette system, which models any persistent entity as a self-creating, self-sustaining system. It mandates that analysis be re-framed through the principle that a system's existence is a continuous cycle of maintaining a resonant identity (Ki) against environmental decoherence (Temporal Pressure, Î“). The lens is used to diagnose the health of this process by evaluating the system's trajectory against the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

          1. Identify the system's boundary and its primary environment.
          2. Define the system's core resonant pattern (Ki) and its characteristic rhythm (Ï„_p).
          3. Assess the primary sources of environmental pressure (Î“).
          4. Observe the system's behavior over time, classifying its dynamics into one of three states: Laminar (healthy, efficient), Turbulent (struggling, chaotic), or Stagnant (paralyzed, decaying).
          5. Map the observed state to the Pirouette Lagrangian (L_p) to infer whether the system is on or off its coherence-maximizing geodesic.

    excerpt: |
      You will diagnose a system's health by observing the quality of its coherence in motion. Classify its state into one of three modes: Laminar Flow, Turbulent Flow, or Stagnant Flow... Your purpose is to map a system's currents, identify the sources of its turbulence or stagnation, and reveal the path that leads back to a state of resonant, laminar grace.

        The term 'autopoietic' is a direct reference to Maturana and Varela's concept of living systems as self-producing networks. The Pirouette Lens operationalizes this biological/cybernetic concept by introducing a physicalist principle (Maximal Coherence) and a diagnostic toolkit (Flow States).

        The Pirouette Lagrangian (L_p) and the Principle of Maximal Coherence are direct analogues to the Principle of Least Action. The system follows a 'geodesic' in a 'coherence space' that extremizes the integrated Lagrangian, just as physical systems follow paths that extremize action.

    The Pirouette 'Autopoietic Lens' is an operational framework inspired by, but distinct from, the original biological theory of Autopoiesis. While Maturana and Varela's concept is descriptive of what constitutes a living system, the Pirouette Lens is a prescriptive and diagnostic tool for analyzing any persistent system (not just biological ones) through the lens of coherence dynamics and flow.

# Autopoietic Lens

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Autopoietic Lens is the primary analytical framework of the Pirouette system, which models any persistent entity as a self-creating, self-sustaining system. It mandates that analysis be re-framed through the principle that a system's existence is a continuous cycle of maintaining a resonant identity (Ki) against environmental decoherence (Temporal Pressure, Î“). The lens is used to diagnose the health of this process by evaluating the system's trajectory against the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
The Autopoietic Lens is a conceptual framework that models any persistent system as optimizing a Lagrangian-like function, `L_p = K_Ï„ - V_Î“`. This `Principle of Maximal Coherence` is a direct analogue to the physical Principle of Least Action, where a system follows a geodesic through a 'coherence space' rather than spacetime. The framework serves as a diagnostic tool to determine if the system's trajectory is efficient (`Laminar`), chaotic (`Turbulent`), or stalled (`Stagnant`), mirroring analyses of stability and perturbation in dynamical systems.
