        - Fractal reassembly tasks: scrambled system to coherent narrative

triad:
  art: |
    To gather scattered shards of thought and see the mosaic they were always meant to form. The mind as a kintsugi artist, finding beauty and strength in the rejoining of broken pieces.
  law: |
    The time required to achieve coherent reassembly (T_R) decreases exponentially with training cycles, while the semantic complexity (C_S) of the resulting assembly increases. For a trained subject, performance Ψ_R = C_S / T_R follows a power law against the initial component entropy.
  philosophy: |
    By practicing the reconstruction of meaning from deliberate chaos, the mind learns that no fragmentation is final. This trains a fundamental resilience against cognitive disruption and cultivates the ability to find signal in any noise.
pirouette_definition: |
  A class of cognitive drills where a subject is presented with a set of disordered, fragmented components (e.g., narrative segments, logical premises, system diagrams) and tasked with assembling them into a coherent, functional, and meaningful whole. These tasks directly train the ability to synthesize fragmented thought states into insight paths, a core skill for interruptive-adaptive cognition.

          Present a subject with 10-20 randomly ordered sentences from a coherent short story. Subject must re-order them into a logical narrative. Measure time to completion (T_R) and accuracy via Levenshtein distance from the original order.

        The task requires the subject to perform cognitive work to reduce the information entropy of the presented components. The scrambled state is high-entropy; the reassembled state is a low-entropy, high-information (meaningful) configuration.

        The reassembly process relies on the brain's innate tendency to perceive ambiguous or complex stimuli in the simplest, most coherent form possible (a "good Gestalt"). The tasks train and measure the efficiency of this process under load.

    In this context, 'Fractal' does not refer to mathematical self-similarity at different scales, but to the nature of the components: each piece is a coherent fragment of a larger, hidden whole. The process of reassembly is one of discovering the global pattern from local clues.

# Fractal reassembly tasks

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A class of cognitive drills where a subject is presented with a set of disordered, fragmented components (e.g., narrative segments, logical premises, system diagrams) and tasked with assembling them into a coherent, functional, and meaningful whole. These tasks directly train the ability to synthesize fragmented thought states into insight paths, a core skill for interruptive-adaptive cognition.

## EFT-First Summary
No direct mapping to EFT is adopted. Conceptually, the task is analogous to an information-theoretic renormalization, where a high-entropy set of components (the "UV" details) is resolved into a low-entropy, coherent state (the "IR" structure) by an observer performing cognitive work to integrate degrees of freedom. This process of finding a stable, low-energy configuration from a disordered state has parallels in statistical mechanics.
