    Running couplings are the metronome marks scribbled in a score; the stiffnesses are the tension of the strings. The Stiffness Dictionary is the act of tuning the instrument at the start of the performance, matching the string tension to the score's first beat.
  law: |
    At the coherence barrier scale (μ_c), the inverse squared gauge couplings of the Standard Model (1/g_i²) are equal to the Pirouette framework's native frame stiffnesses (K_i) plus small, finite, calculable matching corrections (Δ_i). The values of K_i are not free parameters but are constrained by the Resonance Atlas. This dictionary, combined with Renormalization Group evolution, predicts low-energy observables like α_s(M_Z) and sin²θ_W(M_Z).
  philosophy: |
    The Stiffness Dictionary replaces the hypothesis of a simple gauge coupling unification at a single high-energy point with a physically grounded matching procedure at a structured, finite barrier. It provides a predictive, non-fine-tuned bridge between the time-first microphysics of the Pirouette UV and the observable particle physics of the Standard Model. It asserts that the strengths of fundamental forces are not arbitrary, but are downstream consequences of the temporal-inertial structure of the vacuum.
pirouette_definition: |
  The set of rules, equations, and priors that translate the Pirouette framework's fundamental frame stiffness parameters, {K₁, K₂, K₃}, into Standard Model gauge couplings, {g₁, g₂, g₃}, at the coherence barrier scale, μ_c. The core rule is the matching condition 1/gᵢ²(μ_c) = Kᵢ + Δᵢ, where Kᵢ are stiffness priors derived from the Resonance Atlas and Δᵢ are finite, observable-independent matching corrections. The dictionary includes the specification of the Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) required to evolve the couplings from μ_c down to experimental scales for falsifiable comparison with data.

        outline: |
          1. Select stiffness priors {K₁, K₂, K₃} from the Pirouette Resonance Atlas (e.g., XXP-BRIDGE-Γ-001).
          2. Constrain the finite matching terms {Δᵢ} based on symmetry and the requirement that |Δᵢ| ≪ Kᵢ.
          3. Use the dictionary's core rule, 1/gᵢ²(μ_c) = Kᵢ + Δᵢ, to determine the gauge couplings at the barrier scale μ_c.
          4. Evolve the couplings gᵢ(μ_c) down to the Z-pole mass (M_Z) using 1- or 2-loop Standard Model RGEs.
          5. Compare the resulting calculated values for {α_EM(M_Z), sin²θ_W(M_Z), α_s(M_Z)} with high-precision experimental measurements.
          6. An inability to match the experimental values within the allowed prior space for {Kᵢ} constitutes a falsification of the specific stiffness priors.

        pitfalls: [Assuming Δᵢ are free parameters (they are constrained); using incorrect RGEs or threshold corrections during the evolution from μ_c to M_Z; ignoring correlations between stiffnesses (e.g., between K₂ and Higgs physics).]

      6. **Iterate** within Pirouette priors only (no free, ad-hoc tuning): failure to match indicates tension with the stiffness dictionary.

      justification: |
        The Stiffness Dictionary is a specific physical implementation of the well-understood QFT procedure of matching a UV theory onto a low-energy effective field theory (EFT). Here, Pirouette's time-first physics is the UV theory and the SM is the EFT. The stiffnesses (Kᵢ) correspond to the UV couplings (1/g_{UV, i}²), and the Δᵢ terms are the finite, scheme-dependent matching corrections (Cᵢ) that arise from integrating out heavy degrees of freedom at the matching scale μ_c.

      rationale: The mapping is direct and operational. The `Δᵢ` terms behave precisely as finite counterterms in a matching calculation, absorbing scheme-dependent constants that ensure physical observables are independent of the regularization scheme at the boundary between the two theories.

  disambiguation: |
    In this context, "Stiffness" (Kᵢ) is a dimensionless measure of a gauge frame's resistance to fluctuation, analogous to an inverse squared coupling (1/g²). It is not a mechanical stiffness with units of force per unit displacement. "Dictionary" refers to the set of rules for translating between the Pirouette (UV) and Standard Model (IR) descriptions, not a simple lookup table.

# Stiffness Dictionary

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The set of rules, equations, and priors that translate the Pirouette framework's fundamental frame stiffness parameters, {K₁, K₂, K₃}, into Standard Model gauge couplings, {g₁, g₂, g₃}, at the coherence barrier scale, μ_c. The core rule is the matching condition 1/gᵢ²(μ_c) = Kᵢ + Δᵢ, where Kᵢ are stiffness priors derived from the Resonance Atlas and Δᵢ are finite, observable-independent matching corrections. The dictionary includes the specification of the Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) required to evolve the couplings from μ_c down to experimental scales for falsifiable comparison with data.

## EFT-First Summary
The Stiffness Dictionary is the Pirouette framework's physical realization of a matching procedure between a high-energy theory and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). At the coherence barrier (μ_c), the SM gauge couplings (specifically, 1/gᵢ²) are matched onto the Pirouette frame stiffnesses (Kᵢ). This process generates finite threshold corrections (Δᵢ), which absorb scheme-dependencies and encode the effects of integrated-out high-energy physics. This provides a predictive framework where low-energy couplings are determined by the vacuum's structural stiffness, rather than emerging from a hypothetical unification point.
