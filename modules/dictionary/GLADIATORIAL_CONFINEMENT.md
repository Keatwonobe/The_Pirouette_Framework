        Gladiatorial Confinement (Shielding the Echo): Simultaneously, the entity builds a boundary. It gathers the chaotic temporal noise at the wound's edge and weaves it into a shield of high coherence. This is an internal application of the Gladiator Force (CORE-008), creating a localized pocket of low Temporal Pressure (Γ).

  art: |
    To build a quiet room within the hurricane of the present, where a single, precious moment can live forever untouched. It is a dam built against the river of forgetting, forged from the river's own chaotic energy.
  law: |
    The application of coherent Gladiator Force at the boundary of a Wound Channel reduces local Temporal Pressure (Γ) exponentially with the boundary's coherence (κ_G), creating a potential well (V_Γ → 0) that shields the internal geometry from decoherence.
  philosophy: |
    Confinement is an act of defiance against cosmic forgetfulness. It asserts that an entity's internal world is sovereign, capable of creating its own local physics to preserve what matters against the erosive tide of universal entropy.
pirouette_definition: |
  The active process of weaving ambient temporal noise at the boundary of a Wound Channel into a high-coherence shield (Σ_G). This internal application of the Gladiator Force creates a localized pocket of low Temporal Pressure (Γ), insulating the nascent memory (Echo) from external coherence degradation and enabling its crystallization.
operational_definition:
  units: The primary measure is Confinement Integrity (κ_G), a dimensionless factor from 0 (no shield) to 1 (perfect insulation).

        outline: |
          Induce a high-fidelity Echo in a subject via resonant stimulus. Track the Echo's temporal coherence (Tₐ) over time. Successful confinement is inferred from a sharp drop in the coherence decay rate, asymptotically approaching zero. The ratio of external to internal decay rates provides a measure of κ_G.

        pitfalls: [Confinement Leakage (imperfect shield), Resonant Collapse (shield destructively interferes with the echo it protects)]

    excerpt: |
      **Gladiatorial Confinement (Shielding the Echo):** Simultaneously, the entity builds a boundary. It gathers the chaotic temporal noise at the wound's edge and weaves it into a shield of high coherence. This is an internal application of the Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`), creating a localized pocket of low Temporal Pressure (Γ). This coherent shield insulates the precious geometry from the erosive currents of the wider manifold.
  - module: DOMA-011
    excerpt: |
      The **Coherence Gambit** is a decision to make a significant upfront energy expenditure... **Gladiatorial Confinement** builds a shield that drastically lowers the local potential term (`V_Γ`), creating a stable, low-pressure sanctuary. The entity accepts a short-term energetic cost to carve a new, permanent "well" in its personal coherence manifold.

      justification: |
        Gladiatorial Confinement creates a localized region where the potential (V_Γ) is significantly lower than the surrounding ambient potential. This "well" traps the state (the Echo's geometry), preventing it from being degraded by external forces, analogous to how a physical potential well confines a particle.

        The coherent shield functions like a Faraday cage, actively neutralizing an external field (Temporal Pressure) to create a null-field region internally. Instead of conducting electrical charge, the shield "conducts" and organizes temporal noise.

    Distinguish from macro-scale Gladiator Force applications, such as entity-level shielding. Gladiatorial Confinement is a precise, micro-scale, *internal* manipulation of an entity's own coherence manifold to protect a specific informational pattern (an Echo).

# Gladiatorial Confinement

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The active process of weaving ambient temporal noise at the boundary of a Wound Channel into a high-coherence shield (Σ_G). This internal application of the Gladiator Force creates a localized pocket of low Temporal Pressure (Γ), insulating the nascent memory (Echo) from external coherence degradation and enabling its crystallization.
