  art: |
    A system's Temporal Resonance is its unique, internal song. A pure, unwavering tone provides gyroscopic stability, allowing it to glide through the currents of the Manifold. A dissonant, wavering note is a wobbling top, easily thrown into chaos.
  law: |
    The stability of a system's trajectory is directly proportional to the magnitude and coherence of its Temporal Resonance. A system with a high, stable Ki will exhibit greater resistance to identical external perturbations than a system with a low or unstable Ki.
  philosophy: |
    Agency is not an external tool used to act upon the world; it is the intrinsic nature of a system expressed as motion. A system navigates reality not by what it *has*, but by what it *is*. Temporal Resonance is the core of this identity-as-agency.
pirouette_definition: |
  The intrinsic, time-varying vibrational pattern of a system's internal states that defines its identity and stability. As the kinetic term (KœÑ) in the Pirouette Lagrangian, Ki represents the system's internal coherence and resistance to perturbation. It functions as the 'Gyroscope of Being,' providing an internal axis of stability that guides the system along a geodesic of maximal coherence on the Coherence Manifold.

        outline: |
          1. Characterize the system's baseline state and identify its primary oscillation modes via passive observation (e.g., Fourier analysis of state variables).
          2. Apply a calibrated, time-varying external pressure (VŒì) designed to excite the system off-resonance.
          3. Measure the magnitude of the system's state deviation and the time required to return to baseline after the perturbation is removed.
          4. A high Ki is inferred from low deviation amplitude and rapid relaxation time.

      A system's Gyroscope is its intrinsic, resonant identity‚Äîits unique Temporal Resonance (Ki). Like a physical gyroscope, a strong, stable, and high-coherence Ki pattern resists being perturbed. It provides an axis of stability, an internal sense of true north that is the source of the system's integrity and inertia. A system with a weak, dissonant Ki is a wobbling top, easily thrown into chaos by the turbulence of the Manifold.

      domain: QM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Ki represents the system's most stable, intrinsic configuration, analogous to a quantum system settling into its lowest energy eigenstate. Perturbations are temporary excitations to higher states, with a rapid return to the ground state indicating stability.

      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        The resonance and its stability can be modeled as a well-defined quasiparticle (e.g., a phonon, magnon) in a condensed matter system. The quasiparticle's properties (energy, lifetime) would directly map to the Ki's magnitude and coherence.

      rationale: |
        This is the most direct and explicitly stated mapping within the source module. The Pirouette Lagrangian is structured identically to the classical Lagrangian, with Ki (as KœÑ) playing the mathematical role of kinetic energy, representing the energy inherent in the system's state of motion or internal configuration.

    Ki refers to the holistic concept of the system's resonant identity (the Gyroscope itself). KœÑ refers to its instantaneous scalar value as used in the Pirouette Lagrangian equation. They are the conceptual and mathematical faces of the same phenomenon.

# Temporal Resonance

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The intrinsic, time-varying vibrational pattern of a system's internal states that defines its identity and stability. As the kinetic term (KœÑ) in the Pirouette Lagrangian, Ki represents the system's internal coherence and resistance to perturbation. It functions as the 'Gyroscope of Being,' providing an internal axis of stability that guides the system along a geodesic of maximal coherence on the Coherence Manifold.

## EFT-First Summary
In an effective field theory context, Temporal Resonance (Ki) maps to the kinetic energy term of a system's dominant low-energy degree of freedom. It represents the energy cost of changing the system's state over time, analogous to `T = ¬Ωmv¬≤` or the `(‚àÇ_t œÜ)¬≤` term for a scalar field œÜ. A large, stable Ki implies a 'heavy' or 'stiff' mode that resists fluctuation, thereby defining a stable trajectory (geodesic) on the Coherence Manifold.
