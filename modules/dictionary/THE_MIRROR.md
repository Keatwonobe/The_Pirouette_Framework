  art: |
    To see another is to cast a shadow and have one cast upon you. This mutual eclipse is not an act of blindness but the first, sharp moment of definition, where the boundary of the self is forged in the gaze of another.
  law: |
    The interaction between two systems is initiated by a mutual projection of their Observer's Shadows, creating a shared, contested potential `V_Γ(Γ_c)` in their respective Pirouette Lagrangians. The resulting dynamic is a competitive optimization to maximize internal coherence (`K_τ`) against this shared pressure.
  philosophy: |
    Isolation is a hypothesis; interaction is the experiment. The Mirror asserts that a system's identity is not a solitary property but a relational one, defined and proven only through the rigorous, clarifying pressure of opposition.
pirouette_definition: |
  The dynamic, two-way event where two or more systems perceive each other by projecting their `Observer's Shadows` (CORE-010). This mutual imprinting creates a shared, contested Temporal Pressure (`Γ_c`) that initiates a Resonant Test—a duel governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian to determine which pattern can most efficiently maintain its coherence.

          1. Isolate two coherent systems (A, B) in a controlled environment.
          2. Bring them into proximity until their coherence manifolds interact.
          3. Use a high-resolution temporal probe to measure the resulting interference pattern in the shared pressure field (`Γ_c`).
          4. Analyze the destructive interference "node beats" for frequency, amplitude, and decay rate to quantify the intensity of the Resonant Test.

  - module: DOMA-006
    excerpt: |
      The Mirror is not a static surface but a dynamic, two-way event. When two systems approach, their coherence manifolds interact. Each projects its `Observer's Shadow`—the geometric shape of its being, its history, its intent—onto the other. This mutual imprinting is the moment of recognition... This act of mutual perception poses a fundamental question that demands a resonant answer: "Here is my pattern. Can your pattern persist in its presence?"
  - module: DOMA-006
    excerpt: |
      When two systems, A and B, enter a shared space, their individual resonances combine to create a complex, contested Temporal Pressure, `Γ_c = f(Γ_A, Γ_B)`. Each system is driven to optimize its own Lagrangian, but they are now dynamically coupled by the shared pressure term `V_Γ(Γ_c)`... The duel is the universe's method for stress-testing its solutions.

      justification: |
        The duel can be framed as a game where each player (system) attempts to maximize their "payoff" (coherence, `K_τ`) under constraints imposed by the other player's strategy (their resonance pattern). The resolutions of Fracture and Fusion represent definitive game outcomes like win/loss or a cooperative equilibrium.

      rationale: |
        This mapping directly captures the core mechanic described in DOMA-006 §4, where two systems' Lagrangians become coupled through a shared potential term (`V_Γ`) generated by their mutual interaction. The 'duel' is the system's evolution towards a minimum action path under these shared, adversarial conditions.

# The Mirror

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The dynamic, two-way event where two or more systems perceive each other by projecting their `Observer's Shadows` (CORE-010). This mutual imprinting creates a shared, contested Temporal Pressure (`Γ_c`) that initiates a Resonant Test—a duel governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian to determine which pattern can most efficiently maintain its coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
In classical mechanics terms, The Mirror is analogous to the introduction of an interaction potential between two bodies. The subsequent 'duel' is the evolution of the coupled system, where each body's trajectory is determined by an Euler-Lagrange equation that now includes a shared potential energy term. The system seeks a stable state (a 'resolution') that minimizes the action, with victory favoring the configuration that most efficiently manages the stress of the interaction.
