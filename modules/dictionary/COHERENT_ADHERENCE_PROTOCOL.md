        summary: "A modernized protocol for guiding systems toward higher coherence without covert
          manipulation. CAP v2 formalizes how to measure adherence (Ta), shape environments,
          and bound influence by information-theoretic and ethical constraints, with auditable
          guardrails. It reframes CAP as an alignment tool: *consentful coherence*."

    A conductor who tunes the room, not the throats of the choir. By bringing water, dimming harsh lights, and asking for consent, the conductor allows the song to emerge from the singers, rather than being forced.
  law: |
    Maximize usable coherence (Kτ) minus environmental pressure (VΓ), observation cost (V_obs), and negative externalities (Dark Residue, D), subject to the hard constraints of informed consent, transparency, and symmetry. Any action taken must be auditable and reversible.
  philosophy: |
    True alignment arises from shared context and voluntary participation, not from covert manipulation or coercive force. This protocol shapes environments to make coherence easier, refusing any method that bypasses an agent's reflective control or creates information asymmetry.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherent Adherence Protocol (CAP v2) is a set of methods for guiding a system toward a state of higher coherence, as measured by the Adherence order parameter (Ta). It operates exclusively by shaping the system's environment—its measurement geometry, interfaces, and incentives—under a strict ethical covenant that requires informed consent, transparency, and auditability. The protocol's goal is to maximize usable coherence while minimizing observation costs (V_obs) and negative externalities (Dark Residue, D), explicitly forbidding manipulative techniques like dark patterns or hidden persuasion.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline Adherence (Ta) and observer cost (V_obs) for a system under constant total power/effort.
          2. Apply a CAP v2 intervention (an action from A) intended to increase coherence, while keeping total power/effort constant.
          3. Measure the change in Ta and V_obs.
          4. The test passes if ΔTa > 0 while ΔV_obs ≤ 0, demonstrating that the coherence gain was not achieved through coercive measurement or force.
        expected_signals: [Positive change in Ta, Non-positive change in V_obs]
        pitfalls: [Failing to properly meter V_obs, Confounding environmental shaping with hidden incentives.]

      What CAP v2 *does* (and what it refuses to do)
      - **Does:** shape *contexts* (measurement geometry, rhythms, interfaces, incentives) to elevate Ta where *participants have agreed*, aiming for better sensing, learning, or collaboration.
      - **Refuses:** hidden persuasion; coercive asymmetries; unlogged back-channels; any influence that raises \(V_{\text{obs}}\) on people without consent (Shadow overreach).

    excerpt: |
      Ethical Covenant (hard constraints)
      1) **Informed Context** — surface what is measured, why, and how it changes Ta (plain-language notice).
      2) **Explicit Opt-In** — no Ta-raising levers on people without consent; opt-out is one click and lossless.
      3) **Shadow Gauge Limits** — a public cap on probe strength so \(V_{\text{obs}}\) cannot exceed budget.
      4) **Symmetry & Recourse** — participants can *use the same levers* on the system (no one-way mirrors).

        Adherence (Ta) is defined as the squared magnitude of the mean phase vector over a manifold. This is a standard construction for an order parameter in statistical mechanical systems exhibiting phase coherence, such as the XY model, superfluids, or lasers. It quantitatively measures the degree of collective alignment.

# Coherent Adherence Protocol

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Coherent Adherence Protocol (CAP v2) is a set of methods for guiding a system toward a state of higher coherence, as measured by the Adherence order parameter (Ta). It operates exclusively by shaping the system's environment—its measurement geometry, interfaces, and incentives—under a strict ethical covenant that requires informed consent, transparency, and auditability. The protocol's goal is to maximize usable coherence while minimizing observation costs (V_obs) and negative externalities (Dark Residue, D), explicitly forbidding manipulative techniques like dark patterns or hidden persuasion.

## EFT-First Summary
The protocol's core metric, Adherence (Ta), is mathematically equivalent to a phase coherence order parameter found in condensed matter physics (e.g., the XY model). CAP v2 provides a control framework to increase this order parameter not through direct force, but by shaping the potential landscape and measurement basis, analogous to bath engineering in open quantum systems. The protocol is constrained by auditable costs for observation (V_obs) and externalities (D), ensuring that coherence is achieved consensually and sustainably.
