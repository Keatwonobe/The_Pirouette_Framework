  art: |
    A system, under pressure, discovers its own heartbeat. It is the emergent dance of coherence, a self-sustaining orbit carved into the fabric of time.
  law: |
    A stable Ki rhythm is a periodic orbit, φ*(t), with period τₚ that minimizes the Pirouette action functional. Its period is inversely related to the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ), such that d(τₚ)/d(Γ) < 0.
  philosophy: |
    The existence of Ki rhythms closes the framework's autopoietic loop (Tₐ→Γ→Ki→Tₐ), proving that self-sustaining, resonant structures are not incidental but a mathematical necessity of the Pirouette Lagrangian. It is the proof that coherence must find a way to perpetuate itself.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable, periodic orbit of kinetic resonance (Ki) that emerges as a solution, φ*(t), to the Pirouette Lagrangian. This solution extremizes the action functional J[φ] over its characteristic period, τₚ. The period τₚ is a direct, negative function of the local Temporal Pressure, Γ, allowing the system to adapt its internal tempo to external conditions.
operational_definition:
  units: The phase φ is dimensionless (radians). The period τₚ is measured in seconds (s).
  symbol_table:
    - name: φ*(t)
      meaning: The state (phase) of the system along the stable periodic orbit as a function of time.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: [0, 2π)
    - name: τₚ
      meaning: The characteristic period of the Ki rhythm; the time required to complete one cycle.
      dimensions: T
      default_range: contextual (e.g., 10⁻¹⁵ s for atomic systems, 10⁸ s for galactic)
    - name: J[φ]
      meaning: The Pirouette action functional, whose extremization over a cycle yields the Ki rhythm.

      - name: Periodic-Orbit Shooting (Numerical)
        outline: |
          1. Define the system's potential V(φ, Γ) and kinetic term K_τ.
          2. Make an initial guess for the orbit's starting phase φ₀ and period τ₀. Impose a phase condition to remove temporal translation degeneracy.
          3. Integrate the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion over the interval [0, τ₀].
          4. Calculate the residual R = φ(τ₀) − φ₀. Use a Newton-Raphson method with the monodromy matrix to iteratively correct (φ₀, τ₀) until ||R|| is below a tolerance ε.

    excerpt: |
      The Pirouette Framework is built upon a single, foundational claim: that reality is a self-creating, self-sustaining resonant cycle. The loop of Time Adherence (T_a) influencing Temporal Pressure (Gamma), which in turn shapes the Kinetic resonance (Ki), which then feeds back into Time Adherence, is the engine of being. This module provides the mathematical proof that this engine is not a metaphor, but a necessary consequence...
  - module: MATH-004
    excerpt: |
      We have now closed the circle. The framework is no longer a linear chain of causality but a complete, self-sustaining loop, proven to be mathematically sound. ... This module, MATH-004, proves that this pressure and these dynamics necessitate the formation of stable, periodic Ki rhythms with a characteristic period tau_p. The existence of a stable rhythm (Ki) is the basis for Time Adherence (T_a). Thus, the loop is closed.

      justification: |
        A Ki rhythm is formally defined as an isolated, stable periodic orbit of a dynamical system derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian. This is the canonical definition of a limit cycle in the theory of dynamical systems.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish between the Ki rhythm itself (the entire orbit/solution φ*(t)), its characteristic period (the scalar τₚ), and its instantaneous phase (the value φ at a specific time t). The rhythm is the "song", the period is its "tempo", and the phase is a "note".
