    A healing dose administered to the framework's body, designed to mend a fracture in its logic or soothe a fever of contradiction.
  law: |
    Any proposed change to the framework's principles must be formally treated as a Coherence Injection, subject to a diagnostic triage and a coherence-maximizing integration protocol.
  philosophy: |
    By framing change as a therapeutic intervention rather than a political victory, the framework's evolution is oriented towards systemic health, treating dissent as a diagnostic symptom and resolution as a return to resonant harmony.
pirouette_definition: |
  A formal proposal for change within the Pirouette Framework, framed as a therapeutic intervention intended to resolve an identified systemic distress (e.g., Coherence Atrophy, Fever, or Erosion). It is not a motion to be won, but a potential remedy to be integrated into the system's autopoietic loop via a process of Resonant Synthesis, guided by the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

        outline: |
          The "measurement" of a Coherence Injection is the formal protocol for evaluating its potential to increase systemic coherence. The proposal is modeled as a delta to the framework's Lagrangian. Its fitness is then quantified via a two-part test: a high-threshold supermajority vote on its integrative potential (KœÑ) and a measure of the stability of that consensus over time (dKœÑ/dt).

        A Coherence Injection is analogous to proposing a new interaction term (Œ¥ùìõ) to add to an Effective Field Theory's Lagrangian. The new term is designed to resolve a discrepancy (a 'systemic distress') between theory and observation. The 'Coherence Test' is the equivalent of fitting the model to data and requiring a statistically significant and stable improvement in explanatory power.

# Coherence Injection

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A formal proposal for change within the Pirouette Framework, framed as a therapeutic intervention intended to resolve an identified systemic distress (e.g., Coherence Atrophy, Fever, or Erosion). It is not a motion to be won, but a potential remedy to be integrated into the system's autopoietic loop via a process of Resonant Synthesis, guided by the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of Effective Field Theory, a Coherence Injection is a proposed new term (Œ¥ùìõ) for the framework's Lagrangian. It is introduced to resolve an observed anomaly ('systemic distress'). Its adoption is contingent on demonstrating, via the Coherence Test, that it represents a more optimal and stable path for the system's evolution, effectively increasing the action integral `‚à´(KœÑ - V_Œì) dt`.
