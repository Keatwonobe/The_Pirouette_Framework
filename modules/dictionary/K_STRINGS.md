    The fundamental string is a single strand of color field. A k-string is a thicker rope woven from `k` such strands, bound not by simple addition but by the gauge group's topology. It hums with a deeper note, dictated by this collective winding number.
  law: |
    The tension of a confining flux tube (σ_k) sourced by a representation with N-ality `k` is a universal function of `k` and the number of colors `N`. This tension ratio σ_k/σ is independent of other properties of the source representation, such as its quadratic Casimir, providing a direct, measurable test of the center-vortex confinement mechanism.
  philosophy: |
    k-strings demonstrate that confinement is a topological effect tied to the center of the gauge group, not just a brute-force accumulation of charge. They are a crucial gate for confirming that a model captures the deep structure of Yang-Mills theory, rather than superficially fitting the fundamental potential. Their existence and scaling properties distinguish between competing confinement pictures.
pirouette_definition: |
  Confining flux tubes formed between static color sources in a representation of SU(N) with non-trivial N-ality `k > 0`. Their linear energy density, or tension (σ_k), is primarily determined by `k`. The fundamental string corresponds to k=1. The scaling of σ_k with `k` is a key nonperturbative prediction and a direct probe of the center-vortex mechanism underlying confinement.

          1. On a Euclidean lattice, compute the expectation value of large T×R rectangular Wilson loops for static sources in the fundamental representation (N-ality k=1).
          2. Extract the fundamental string tension (σ) from the area-law decay: ⟨W(R,T)⟩ ~ exp(-σRT).
          3. Repeat for sources in a higher representation with N-ality `k` (e.g., the symmetric 2-index tensor for k=2 in SU(3)).
          4. Extract the k-string tension (σ_k) from the corresponding area-law decay.
          5. Compute the dimensionless ratio σ_k/σ.

  disambiguation: |
    Refers to N-ality `k`, a property of the source representation, not a string with momentum `k`. While the concept of a flux tube is related to string theory, a k-string in QCD is a specific non-perturbative field configuration, not a fundamental object in a higher-dimensional spacetime. It is distinct from the tensionless string of adjoint sources (which are screened, leading to string breaking).

# k-strings

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Confining flux tubes formed between static color sources in a representation of SU(N) with non-trivial N-ality `k > 0`. Their linear energy density, or tension (σ_k), is primarily determined by `k`. The fundamental string corresponds to k=1. The scaling of σ_k with `k` is a key nonperturbative prediction and a direct probe of the center-vortex mechanism underlying confinement.

## EFT-First Summary
In non-perturbative Yang-Mills theory, the tension of the flux tube between static sources depends on the source's N-ality `k`. Lattice QCD results strongly support a "sine law" scaling, where the k-string tension σ_k relates to the fundamental tension σ via σ_k/σ = sin(πk/N)/sin(π/N). This observation, which contradicts naive Casimir scaling, is a key piece of evidence for confinement mechanisms based on the center of the gauge group and provides a sharp, quantitative test for any theory of the QCD vacuum.
