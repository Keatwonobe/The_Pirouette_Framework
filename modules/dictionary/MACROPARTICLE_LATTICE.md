      The First Curl did not propagate into empty chaos, but into the waiting welcome of the Lattice.

        In some quantum gravity theories (e.g., LQG, CDT), continuous spacetime is an emergent property of a fundamental discrete, graph-like, or lattice-like structure at the Planck scale. The Macroparticle Lattice serves as the pre-geometric, information-theoretic blueprint for such a structure.

      rationale: Captures the core idea of a fundamental, discrete grid underlying the continuous appearance of reality. The "pre-geometric" nature of ℒ₀ aligns with the relational, background-independent philosophy of many quantum gravity approaches.

  disambiguation: |
    The Macroparticle Lattice is a pre-geometric, conceptual grid of *potential* states, not a physical lattice of particles like a crystal or a computational grid like in Lattice QCD. It is the structure *of* space, not a structure *in* space.

# Macroparticle Lattice

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Macroparticle Lattice (ℒ₀) is the implied, regular, and crystalline structure of reality that exists as pure potential within the pre-cosmic Void. Conceptually organized around the Genesect, ℒ₀ is not a physical grid but a topological framework of allowed states, positions, and relations. It prefigures the possibility of form and serves as the foundational substrate upon which forces and particles later manifest.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, the Macroparticle Lattice maps to proposals in quantum gravity for a discrete, lattice-like structure of spacetime at the Planck scale, from which the smooth manifold of General Relativity emerges at low energies. It acts as a pre-geometric information field defining the allowed connectivity and dimensionality of spacetime. Potential observable consequences include faint statistical anisotropies on the largest scales of the Cosmic Microwave Background.
