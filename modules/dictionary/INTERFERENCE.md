        Gamma is the pressure created by a trillion temporal hammers striking at once, each forging its own reality. It is the constructive and destructive interference of every rhythm echoing through the cosmos.

  art: |
    At any point, the universe's song is a chord struck by every event that has ever been. Interference is how that chord is voiced, whether as a clear harmony, a dull drone, or a deafening cacophony.
  law: |
    The local scalar value of Gamma (Γ) at a spacetime coordinate is the resultant amplitude derived from the linear superposition of all incident Temporal Signatures (T(x)). There is no other source of Gamma.
  philosophy: |
    Interference replaces the concept of fundamental forces with a model of emergent environmental pressure. Reality is not 'pushed' or 'pulled'; it is 'forged' in the complex, overlapping resonance of its own history.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental process by which multiple, distinct temporal rhythms superimpose at a specific spacetime coordinate. This combination, which can be constructive (amplifying) or destructive (dampening), determines the total local complexity of the temporal environment, a scalar value measured as Gamma (Γ). It is the mechanism of the Temporal Forge.

        outline: |
          Interference is not measured directly; its effect, Gamma (Γ), is.
          1. Select a proxy for Gamma, such as local temperature (thermodynamic systems) or spacetime curvature (gravitational systems).
          2. Measure the proxy with high precision (e.g., using a bolometer for temperature or gravitational lensing for curvature).
          3. Model the expected contributing Temporal Signatures from known sources within the causal horizon.
          4. The measured Gamma value represents the integrated result of their interference.
        expected_signals: [Black-body radiation spectrum, gravitational redshift, frame-dragging.]
        pitfalls: [Incomplete modeling of all causal sources, instrumental noise overwhelming the signal, misinterpreting quantum decoherence as classical interference.]

    excerpt: |
      Every point in spacetime is a nexus, a point of intersection for the echoes of every event within its causal horizon. This superposition of countless rhythms creates a dense, complex, and often chaotic "temporal environment." The measure of this environmental complexity is Γ.

        The principle of superposition in quantum mechanics, where the net state is a sum of all possible states, is conceptually identical to Pirouette's Interference. In both cases, a complex local reality (probability density |Ψ|² vs. temporal density Γ) emerges from the linear combination of more fundamental, wave-like entities (state vectors vs. temporal rhythms).

  disambiguation: |
    While mathematically analogous to interference in optics or quantum mechanics, in Pirouette the term refers specifically to the superposition of *temporal rhythms* as the fundamental substrate of reality, not of electromagnetic fields or probability amplitudes. It is the ontological basis for Gamma, not just a property of certain fields.

# Interference

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The fundamental process by which multiple, distinct temporal rhythms superimpose at a specific spacetime coordinate. This combination, which can be constructive (amplifying) or destructive (dampening), determines the total local complexity of the temporal environment, a scalar value measured as Gamma (Γ). It is the mechanism of the Temporal Forge.

## EFT-First Summary
Interference is the Pirouette analog for the principle of superposition in wave mechanics and quantum field theory. Just as a total quantum state is the sum of constituent state vectors (Ψ_total = Σ c_n ψ_n), Pirouette posits that the local texture of reality (Gamma, Γ) is the sum of all incident temporal rhythms. This provides a foundational, process-based origin for phenomena typically described by energy density or spacetime curvature.
