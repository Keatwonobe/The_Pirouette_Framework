    A particle’s path through spacetime is not a mere line but a 'worldtube' with thickness. Its quantum self-interactions are the very act of this tube curving, twisting, and knotting itself, writing its history into the local geometry.
  law: |
    The contributions of specific QFT loop diagram topologies to a particle's properties can be mapped one-to-one onto terms in a geometric recursion that describes the evolving curvature and torsion of the particle's worldtube. This mapping is predictive and must reproduce standard QFT results at all loop orders.
  philosophy: |
    To reframe the abstract combinatorics of Feynman diagrams as a tangible, local evolution of spacetime geometry. It posits that quantum corrections are not just abstract numbers but are the spacetime's geometric response to a particle's presence and history.
pirouette_definition: |
  Pirouette Geometry is a framework that provides a geometric interpretation for quantum field theory (QFT) loop corrections. It maps the contributions of Feynman diagram topologies to terms in a geometric recursion, describing the self-induced curvature, torsion, and extrinsic properties of a particle's spacetime history (its 'worldtube'). In this view, renormalization corresponds to a coordinate redefinition that keeps the worldtube's geometry finite and physically meaningful.

        Pirouette Geometry is defined as a dual description for calculating perturbative QED corrections. As established in MATH-015, the calculation of the two-loop coefficient C₂ via standard methods can be mapped term-by-term to a geometric update rule for a particle's worldtube. This mapping is the framework's core premise.

# Pirouette Geometry

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Pirouette Geometry is a framework that provides a geometric interpretation for quantum field theory (QFT) loop corrections. It maps the contributions of Feynman diagram topologies to terms in a geometric recursion, describing the self-induced curvature, torsion, and extrinsic properties of a particle's spacetime history (its 'worldtube'). In this view, renormalization corresponds to a coordinate redefinition that keeps the worldtube's geometry finite and physically meaningful.

## EFT-First Summary
Pirouette Geometry is a mathematical formalism that re-expresses the calculation of QED loop corrections, such as those for the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (`g-2`), in the language of differential geometry. Instead of summing Feynman diagrams, one computes updates to the curvature of a particle's effective trajectory ('worldtube'). This provides a direct, geometric intuition for phenomena like vacuum polarization and renormalization, mapping them to concepts like induced curvature and coordinate re-charting. The primary evidence for this duality is the successful reproduction of the universal two-loop QED coefficient `C₂ ≈ +0.328` as detailed in module MATH-015.
