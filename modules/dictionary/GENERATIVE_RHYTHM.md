        **Generative Rhythm `(ω_g)`**: This is the fundamental frequency or "beat" of the recursive process. It is the temporal heartbeat of the fractal's growth, defining the characteristic scale of its primary iteration and the tempo at which it reinforces its own Wound Channel.

triad:
  art: |
    The pulse of a lightning strike, the cadence of a branching river. It is the universe's preferred tempo for writing its signature across scales, the rhythmic heartbeat of a pattern being born.
  law: |
    A self-similar process's fundamental frequency of recursion (ω_g) directly and proportionally contributes to its final structural complexity (D_f) and the rate at which it reinforces its Wound Channel.
  philosophy: |
    Beyond static geometry, ω_g reveals that fractal patterns are not just shapes but music. It is the temporal engine of recursion, showing that the most efficient forms of growth are rhythmic, resonant processes, not just static blueprints.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental frequency or temporal beat of a fractal's recursive growth process. It represents the characteristic tempo of the primary iteration, defining the temporal scale at which a system reinforces its own Wound Channel and builds its structure via scale-invariant resonance.

      - name: Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM)
        outline: |
          Apply a continuous wavelet transform to a time-series or spatial data representing the system's growth. The dominant frequency peak in the resulting scalogram, corresponding to the characteristic scale of self-similar iteration, is identified as ω_g.
        expected_signals: [A pronounced, isolated peak in the power spectrum or wavelet scalogram.]
        pitfalls: [Noise obscuring the primary frequency, multiple competing rhythms requiring decomposition.]
      - name: Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)
        outline: |
          Analyze the fluctuations in a time series after removing polynomial trends. Periodic oscillations in the detrended fluctuation profile can reveal the underlying rhythm, whose period corresponds to 1/ω_g.
        expected_signals: [Periodic oscillations around the trend line in the DFA plot.]
        pitfalls: [Non-stationarity producing spurious results, improper selection of detrending order.]

    excerpt: |
      To analyze this generative process, we move beyond a simple description of its shape and measure the dynamic properties of its growth, collapsing the old cumbersome vectors into three core signatures:
      1. **Coherence Complexity `(D_f)`**
      2. **Inter-Scale Coherence `(T_a_scale)`**
      3. **Generative Rhythm `(ω_g)`**: This is the fundamental frequency or "beat" of the recursive process.
  - module: DOMA-136
    excerpt: |
      This equation formalizes the Fractal Geodesic, showing how a pattern's complexity emerges from the interplay between its own generative rules and its environment:
      `D_f ≈ 1 + C * (ω_g) * ( T_a_scale / (1 - T_a_scale) ) * f(Γ)`
      This formalizes the intuition that a pattern's complexity (`D_f`) is amplified by a strong generative rhythm (`ω_g`) and a highly coherent recursive rule (`T_a_scale`)...

      equation_hint: |
        ω_g = argmax_ω S(ω)
      justification: |
        In signal processing, the peak of the PSD of a time series reveals its dominant frequency component. ω_g is the Pirouette equivalent for the time-series of a fractal's growth process, representing the most powerful tempo of its self-similar iteration.

      justification: |
        A Hopf bifurcation marks the "birth" of a stable, periodic oscillation (a limit cycle) from a steady state. ω_g can be interpreted as the frequency of this emergent limit cycle, representing the new, stable generative tempo of the system as it enters a rhythmic growth phase.

    - statement: "In systems governed by the Principle of Correspondence, increasing the generative rhythm (ω_g) while holding inter-scale coherence (T_a_scale) and temporal pressure (Γ) constant will result in an increased Coherence Complexity (D_f)."

      falsifier: "Observation of a population of self-similar systems where higher generative frequencies consistently correlate with lower, or have no correlation with, fractal dimension, ceteris paribus."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from simple oscillation. ω_g is the frequency of a *recursive, structure-building* process, not just any periodic motion. It is the tempo of growth, not merely the tempo of vibration. The subscript `g` explicitly denotes its 'generative' role in the Pirouette Lagrangian.
