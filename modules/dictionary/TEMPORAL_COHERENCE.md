        Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ): This "kinetic" term represents the quality and intensity of a system's own rhythm. It is the product of its Time Adherence (T_a) and its fundamental resonant frequency (œâ_k, where œâ_k = 2œÄ/œÑ_p).

    The pure, unwavering note held against the storm; the sharp, clean line drawn by a skater's blade. It is the measure of a system's inner song, its clarity and tempo.
  law: |
    Temporal Coherence is the product of a system's Time Adherence (the signal-to-noise ratio of its cycle) and its fundamental resonant angular frequency. It is the term maximized by a system's dynamics, subject to environmental constraints (Temporal Pressure).
  philosophy: |
    Temporal Coherence is the objective function of existence within the Pirouette Framework. It posits that the universe's primary drive is not towards lower energy states, but towards states of greater rhythmic integrity and stability.
pirouette_definition: |
  Temporal Coherence is the 'kinetic' term in the Pirouette Lagrangian, representing a system's internal dynamic stability and intensity. It is mathematically defined as the product of the system's Time Adherence (T_a), a dimensionless measure of its rhythmic purity, and its fundamental resonant angular frequency (œâ_k). High Temporal Coherence corresponds to a system with a fast, clear, and stable internal cycle.

          For a system with a discernible Pirouette Cycle, record its state evolution over multiple cycles. Perform a Fourier analysis on the time series data to identify the fundamental frequency (œâ_k). Infer Time Adherence (T_a) from the ratio of power in the fundamental peak to total spectral power. K_œÑ is then calculated as T_a * œâ_k.

      A system will naturally adjust its state (its Ki, and therefore its œâ_k and T_a) to find the "sweet spot"‚Äîthe state of highest possible internal coherence for the lowest environmental cost. This is the mathematical formalization of the "path of least resistance" described in CORE-004.

        Temporal Coherence occupies the mathematical position of the kinetic energy term in the classical Lagrangian formulation. Whereas kinetic energy scales with mass and velocity squared (¬Ωmv¬≤), Temporal Coherence scales with frequency and rhythmic purity (T_a ¬∑ œâ_k), framing "motion" as rhythmic stability rather than spatial displacement.

# Temporal Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Temporal Coherence is the 'kinetic' term in the Pirouette Lagrangian, representing a system's internal dynamic stability and intensity. It is mathematically defined as the product of the system's Time Adherence (T_a), a dimensionless measure of its rhythmic purity, and its fundamental resonant angular frequency (œâ_k). High Temporal Coherence corresponds to a system with a fast, clear, and stable internal cycle.

## EFT-First Summary
Temporal Coherence serves as the analog to kinetic energy in the Pirouette Lagrangian. Instead of describing energy of motion through space (¬Ωmv¬≤), it quantifies the "energy" of a system's oscillation through time, defined by its frequency and stability (T_a ¬∑ œâ_k). According to the Principle of Maximal Coherence, physical systems evolve along paths that maximize this quantity, analogous to particles following geodesics in General Relativity.
