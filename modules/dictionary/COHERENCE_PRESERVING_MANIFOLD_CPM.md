    A placid surface on the temporal ocean, where ripples travel true and far without distortion, mimicking the perfect vacuum of spacetime.
  law: |
    A dynamical regime of the Pirouette substrate is a Coherence-Preserving Manifold if and only if: (1) photon propagation is non-dispersive and non-birefringent to experimental limits, and (2) background temporal pressure (`Γ`) currents are conserved (`∇_μ J^μ_Γ = 0`), implying no source or sink of substrate anisotropy.
  philosophy: |
    The CPM formalizes the necessary conditions for a discrete, dynamic substrate to convincingly masquerade as the continuous, passive spacetime of General Relativity and the Standard Model, acting as the bridge between Pirouette dynamics and observed low-energy physics.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM) is the set of dynamical conditions on the time-first substrate fields (`ρ`, `θ`, `Γ`) under which its collective excitations behave as Lorentz-invariant, massless particles in a smooth, isotropic vacuum. The defining constraints are:
  1.  **Isotropy**: The temporal pressure current is conserved (`∇_μ J^μ_Γ = 0`), preventing background shear and ensuring a uniform medium for propagation.
  2.  **Nondispersion**: The kinetic term `P(X)` has high-`X` asymptotics that ensure shear waves (photons) propagate at a single, frequency-independent speed `c`.
  3.  **Decoupling**: Massive substrate modes (like `Γ`-fluctuations) are gapped above a high **coherence barrier** `ω_c`, rendering them inert at accessible energy scales.

        outline: |
          Measure the arrival times of high-energy photons from distant, transient astrophysical events (e.g., Gamma-Ray Bursts, fast radio bursts) across a wide energy spectrum. A robust time-of-flight correlation with photon energy, after accounting for known plasma effects, would indicate a non-zero vacuum refractive index `n(ω) ≠ 1`.

      Baseline Lagrangian of the temporal medium ... is chosen to reproduce Lorentz-invariant shear dynamics on the **Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM)**. ... On CPM, the high-(X) form of (P) enforces nondispersive shear propagation, fixing the observed luminal speed (c). Residual dispersion is forbidden at current bounds.

    excerpt: |
      To ensure exact Lorentz/gauge equivalence with QED at accessible energies, impose:
      * **CPM:** (`∇_μ J^μ_Γ = 0,; J^μ_Γ ≡ Γ,∂^μ Γ`) (no background shear anisotropy).
      * **Nondispersion:** high-(X) asymptotics of (P) tuned so photon group/phase velocities match (c) to current limits.
      * **Decoupling:** Γ-fluctuations heavier than relevant scales → pure QED renormalization below the **coherence barrier** ( `ω_c` ).

        `g_μν` on CPM → `η_μν = diag(1, -1, -1, -1)`
      rationale: |
        The CPM is the set of conditions under which the Pirouette substrate becomes operationally indistinguishable from the flat, empty, Lorentz-invariant vacuum of Special Relativity and Quantum Field Theory. It is the Pirouette pre-figure of the "stage" for standard physics.

  disambiguation: |
    In standard physics, a "manifold" refers to the spacetime point-set itself. In Pirouette, the CPM is not the stage, but a specific *dynamical state* of the underlying substrate. It is a sub-manifold in the state space of the fields (`ρ`,`θ`,`Γ`) where emergent physics is simple and Lorentz-invariant.
