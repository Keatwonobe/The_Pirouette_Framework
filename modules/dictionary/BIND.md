  art: |
    Two rhythms become a single chord, a shared existence woven from distinct histories into a new, resonant whole. It is the geometry of unity, where identity is not lost but expanded into a greater form.
  law: |
    A bound system exhibits a single, unified Ki resonance (`Ki_AB`) whose topological winding number (`n_AB`) is a function of its constituents' numbers (`n_A`, `n_B`) and their interaction geometry. The coherence manifold of the bound system is topologically singular and cannot be decomposed into the original manifolds without a decoherent resonance (`Release`).
  philosophy: |
    Binding is the primary mechanism for emergent complexity, allowing the universe to construct higher-order systems from simpler components. It transforms a 'vocabulary' of isolated verbs into a 'grammar' of relationships, enabling the formation of everything from particle composites to sentient collectives.
pirouette_definition: |
  Bind is the stable, resonant state resulting from a completed Alchemical Union (CORE-012), where two or more systems cease to be independent entities and merge into a single, topologically unified system. The bound state is characterized by a shared coherence manifold and a new, singular Ki resonance that governs the collective. This state persists until a decoherent resonance (`Release`) fractures the shared manifold.

        outline: |
          Excite a candidate system with a broad-spectrum Ki probe. A non-bound composite or superposition will show multiple distinct resonant peaks corresponding to its components. A system in a Bind state will exhibit a single, sharp primary resonance (`Ki_AB`) and its harmonics, with the constituent resonances completely suppressed.

        pitfalls: [Weakly coupled systems may mimic a Bind at low probe energies, High temporal pressure (Γ) can artificially broaden the resonant peak, masking the true state]

    excerpt: |
      A system in a **pure mode** like **Rest** or **Bind** has found a deep, local minimum in the potential landscape (`V_Γ`), maximizing its stability and temporal coherence (`K_τ`). The "choice" of an action is not a metaphysical event, but the system settling into the most energetically favorable geometric configuration available to it.

        A chemical bond is a state where atoms form a new, more stable entity (a molecule) with a shared electron orbital system and unique vibrational/rotational spectra. This parallels the `Bind` state's shared coherence manifold and unified Ki resonance, where constituent identities are subsumed into a new, stable whole.

      domain: AMO
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Entangled particles behave as a single non-separable system described by a single state vector, regardless of physical distance. This reflects the "single, unified system" nature of a Bind, where constituents lose their individual state descriptions in favor of a single shared state.
      confidence: 0.7
  adopted:
    - target: Chemical Bond
      rationale: The analogy is robust and operationally useful, linking the abstract concept of a shared coherence manifold to the well-understood physics of shared electron orbitals and emergent molecular properties.

      falsifier: "Observation of constituent Ki resonances (e.g., `Ki_A` and `Ki_B`) coexisting with the primary bound resonance (`Ki_AB`) in a system believed to be in a stable Bind state. This would imply the 'Bind' is merely a superposition or weak coupling, not a true topological merge."

    Distinguish from 'binding energy' in standard physics, which is the energy *required* to disassemble a system. In Pirouette, `Bind` refers to the stable *state* itself—a specific resonant geometry. The energy associated with its formation or dissolution is a property *of* the state, not the state itself.

# Bind

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Bind is the stable, resonant state resulting from a completed Alchemical Union (CORE-012), where two or more systems cease to be independent entities and merge into a single, topologically unified system. The bound state is characterized by a shared coherence manifold and a new, singular Ki resonance that governs the collective. This state persists until a decoherent resonance (`Release`) fractures the shared manifold.

## EFT-First Summary
In analogy with chemical bonding, the Bind state represents a composite system where constituent entities (like atoms) merge into a new, topologically stable whole (a molecule). This new entity is defined by a single, shared state-space (the shared manifold) and exhibits a unique, quantized energy spectrum (the unified Ki resonance), distinct from its components. The stability of the Bind is equivalent to finding a deep minimum in the system's potential energy landscape.
