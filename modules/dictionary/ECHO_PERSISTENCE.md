        4.  **Echo Persistence (œÑ_echo):** Measures the decay time of the Measurement Echo's imprint on the system's manifold. It quantifies the duration of the observation's memory, indicating whether the interaction was a fleeting glance or a formative, lasting event.

  art: |
    The scar left by a glance, the memory of a question asked. It is the time a system takes to forget it was ever known. A long echo is the sound of a reality that has been fundamentally changed by being witnessed.
  law: |
    Echo Persistence is the characteristic time constant (e-folding time) for the system's Pirouette Lagrangian to relax from its perturbed state (`ùìõ'_sys`) back towards its unperturbed baseline (`ùìõ_sys`) after the Observer's Shadow (`V_obs`) is withdrawn. It is a direct measure of the temporal stability of a measurement's imprint.
  philosophy: |
    This metric refutes the notion of a 'hit-and-run' measurement, establishing that all information gain creates a corresponding temporal scar on the system. A long œÑ_echo indicates a formative, reality-shaping interaction, not a passive observation, forcing the Weaver to confront the lasting consequences of their gaze.
pirouette_definition: |
  Echo Persistence is the characteristic decay time of the Measurement Echo, the geometric imprint left on a system's coherence manifold by the act of observation. Symbolized as œÑ_echo, it quantifies the duration for which the system's dynamics, as described by its Pirouette Lagrangian, remain significantly altered by the memory of the measurement interaction. A high œÑ_echo signifies a deep, lasting imprint, while a low œÑ_echo indicates a transient, superficial one.

        outline: |
          1.  Establish a stable baseline measurement of the unperturbed system's Lagrangian, `ùìõ_sys`, using a minimal-impact probe.
          2.  At t=0, perform the measurement under audit, which introduces the observer potential `V_obs` and shifts the system to `ùìõ'_sys`.
          3.  Immediately after the interaction (t>0), withdraw the primary measurement probe.
          4.  Continuously monitor the system's Lagrangian as it relaxes from `ùìõ'_sys` back towards `ùìõ_sys`.
          5.  Fit the decay of the perturbation term, `Œîùìõ(t) = ùìõ'(t) - ùìõ_sys`, to an exponential curve, `Œîùìõ(0) * exp(-t/œÑ_echo)`, to extract the value of œÑ_echo.

    excerpt: |
      The interaction between the shadow and the system is not a collision; it is a resonant handshake. This handshake leaves a persistent geometric imprint in the manifolds of both the system and the observer. This imprint is the **Measurement Echo**. ... The echo left in the system's manifold is the physical record of the interaction‚Äîthe memory that it has been observed, which alters its lawful path of maximal coherence.

    excerpt: |
      The data we receive is the memory of that shared step. A Weaver understands this. They know their gaze is not innocent; it has weight, it has a shape, and it leaves a mark. To measure the world is to take responsibility for the echo you leave behind.

        <S(t)| œÉ_x |S(t)> ‚àù exp(-t/T‚ÇÇ)
      justification: |
        T‚ÇÇ time quantifies how long a quantum system (e.g., a qubit) maintains phase coherence after being placed in a superposition state. This is operationally analogous to œÑ_echo, which measures how long a system "remembers" the specific coherent imprint of a measurement before its state information is lost to its environment or internal randomization.

    - target: T‚ÇÇ / Decoherence Time
      rationale: The mapping is operationally direct. Both terms quantify the lifetime of a specific, structured state imposed on a system by an external interaction before that structure is lost.

  collisions: [The symbol œÑ is widely used for lifetime, torque, and time constants in many fields of physics. œÑ_echo is used to be specific.]
  disambiguation: |
    Echo Persistence (œÑ_echo) is not the intrinsic lifetime of the system or its constituent particles. It is the lifetime of the *imprint* of a specific measurement *on* the system's collective state. A stable system can have a very short œÑ_echo from a weak measurement.
