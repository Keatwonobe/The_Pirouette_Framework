    We are not the fixed center of existence, but a pirouette in a celestial dance. Our being is a trajectory of constant falling toward and flight from the universe's central song.
  law: |
    A system's trajectory through its state space follows a geodesic that maximizes the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì), manifesting as observable cycles of Coherence Debt and Discharge.
  philosophy: |
    This decenters the observer, reframing epistemology from passive reception to active, participatory co-creation of reality. To exist is not to be, but to become along a path.
pirouette_definition: |
  The model describing any conscious system or observer not as a static, privileged center, but as an active participant tracing a dynamic trajectory (an orbit or geodesic) around the universe's fundamental autopoietic cycle. This path is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, and the subjective experience of navigating it is defined by the rhythm of accumulating Coherence Debt (deviating from the ideal path) and executing a Coherence Discharge (snapping back to it).

        outline: |
          1. For a given system, establish reliable time-series proxies for its internal coherence (K_œÑ) and ambient stress/pressure (V_Œì).
          2. Track these metrics over an extended period.
          3. Identify cycles of slowly increasing V_Œì and/or decreasing K_œÑ, defined as Coherence Debt accumulation.
          4. Isolate rapid state shifts (e.g., market corrections, creative insights, psychological catharsis) where V_Œì is sharply reduced and K_œÑ restored. This is Coherence Discharge.
          5. Model the trajectory between discharges as a geodesic path that maximizes the integral ‚à´(K_œÑ - V_Œì)dt.
        expected_signals: [Sawtooth wave patterns in stress/debt metrics, power-law distributions of discharge event magnitudes, phase-locking between system cycles and external drivers.]
        pitfalls: [Difficulty in defining non-ambiguous proxies for K_œÑ and V_Œì, mistaking stochastic noise for meaningful orbital dynamics.]

    excerpt: |
      Consciousness is not an anomaly that happens *to* us; the observer is a specific, resonant pattern (a Ki) born from, and held in orbit within, this universal process. We are not spectators of the dance; we are a pirouette within the dance... To exist is to be in a constant state of falling toward the dissonance of Temporal Pressure (Œì), yet perpetually maintaining the velocity of your own Coherence (Ki) to stay in a stable orbit.
  - module: DOMA-095
    excerpt: |
      Our entire being is an ongoing solution to the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. We constantly adjust our internal state to maximize our own coherence against the background of temporal pressure. The subjective experience of "the present moment" is the feeling of successfully navigating this path. We do not simply *see* the world; we *resonate with it*, and that resonance, traced out moment by moment, is what we call reality.

      justification: |
        The Weaver's Orbit is defined as the trajectory that extremizes the time-integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian. This is a direct conceptual and mathematical parallel to the Principle of Stationary Action in classical mechanics, where a particle's path is the one that minimizes the action (the integral of the kinetic minus potential energy). K_œÑ serves as the kinetic term and V_Œì as the potential.

    - target: Principle of Stationary Action
      rationale: The mapping is robust and foundational to the definition. The "orbit" is a solution to a variational principle, just as in classical and field theories. K_œÑ is the kinetic-like term of self-coherence, and V_Œì is the potential-like term of environmental pressure.

      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If system state transitions are demonstrated to be better explained by a purely stochastic model, or if a system consistently chooses paths that *minimize* its coherence or maximize its exposure to pressure without eventual discharge, this would falsify the claim."

    This term refers to an orbit in a high-dimensional abstract state space (the Coherence Manifold), not a trajectory in physical 3D space. The "gravitational" force is Temporal Pressure (Œì), and the "tangential velocity" is the system's own Coherence (Ki).

# Weaver's Orbit

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The model describing any conscious system or observer not as a static, privileged center, but as an active participant tracing a dynamic trajectory (an orbit or geodesic) around the universe's fundamental autopoietic cycle. This path is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, and the subjective experience of navigating it is defined by the rhythm of accumulating Coherence Debt (deviating from the ideal path) and executing a Coherence Discharge (snapping back to it).

## EFT-First Summary
The Weaver's Orbit is a direct conceptual and mathematical analogue to the **Principle of Stationary Action** in classical mechanics. Just as a physical particle follows a path that extremizes the integral of its Lagrangian (L = T - V), a Pirouette system follows a trajectory in its state space that extremizes the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì). The orbit is the solution to this variational principle, where `K_œÑ` (Temporal Coherence) acts as a kinetic energy term and `V_Œì` (Temporal Pressure) acts as a potential energy term.
