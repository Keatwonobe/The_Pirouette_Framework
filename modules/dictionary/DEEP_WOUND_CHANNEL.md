        A Deep Wound Channel (CORE-011): The concept has history, inertia, and memory. It has been repeated, reinforced, and woven into the fabric of a mind or a culture. Its pattern is deeply carved into the manifold, giving it immense inertia and making it difficult to alter or erase.

triad:
  art: |
    A channel cut into the landscape of meaning by the relentless flow of repetition; a scar left by a persistent truth, a comfortable rut for thought.
  law: |
    The influence of a concept due to its historical persistence is proportional to the time-integral of its signal amplitude (repetition) and fidelity (coherence) within a cognitive or cultural manifold.
  philosophy: |
    This quantifies the power of history. A concept's validity is not its only source of strength; its persistence carves a path of least resistance, making belief a function of inertia as much as of evidence.
pirouette_definition: |
  A quantitative measure of a concept's historical inertia and cultural reinforcement. It represents the degree to which a concept's pattern has been repeatedly and faithfully inscribed into a coherence manifold over time, creating a stable, low-potential pathway (geodesic) that makes the concept easy to access, difficult to alter, and a powerful attractor for related thoughts. It is the temporal-historical component of a concept's total Temporal Coherence (Kτ), or "mass".

        outline: |
          1. Select a concept and define its lexical and semantic markers.
          2. Assemble a time-series corpus (e.g., digitized books, academic papers, web archives) spanning a significant duration.
          3. For each time slice (e.g., per year), measure the concept's signal amplitude (frequency of use) and signal fidelity (stability of semantic context, low variance in nearest neighbors in an embedding space).
          4. Integrate the product of amplitude and fidelity over the total time period to calculate W_d.

    excerpt: |
      A concept with high coherence, and therefore high "mass," possesses two key properties: 1. A Pure Ki Resonance... 2. A Deep Wound Channel (CORE-011): The concept has history, inertia, and memory. It has been repeated, reinforced, and woven into the fabric of a mind or a culture. Its pattern is deeply carved into the manifold, giving it immense inertia and making it difficult to alter or erase.
  - module: DOMA-035
    excerpt: |
      What we perceive as the force of an argument or the attraction between ideas is the emergent effect of a concept tracing its geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—across the landscape defined by the Lagrangian potential... This explains why it is easier to think thoughts that align with powerful cultural ideas; the path is already carved.

      justification: |
        Concepts with a deep channel are analogous to "relevant operators" in an effective field theory. Over time (the "flow" toward the infrared/large scales), their influence becomes dominant, while concepts with shallow channels ("irrelevant operators") fade from the collective discourse. The channel's depth is a measure of the operator's stability and relevance at a given scale.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The state of the coherence manifold is dependent on its history of reinforcement. A deep channel creates a strong hysteretic effect, where a large "coercive force" (a highly coherent, counter-phase concept) is required to overcome the manifold's ingrained "magnetization" (the established concept).

  claims:
    - statement: "The difficulty of dislodging a cultural concept is directly proportional to its measured Deep Wound Channel depth (W_d), largely independent of its instantaneous internal logical coherence."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Demonstration of a concept with a high W_d (e.g., geocentrism) being rapidly and widely replaced by a new concept with only moderately higher internal coherence, without the application of overwhelming external force (e.g., state censorship, mass propaganda campaigns)."

  disambiguation: |
    The term "wound" does not imply damage or negativity. It is used in the sense of a geological feature, as a river "wounds" the earth to create a canyon. It signifies a deep, lasting, and history-laden impression on the coherence manifold.
