        The old framework termed this a 'Fork'. We reframe it as a **Watershed Event**: a critical, creative, and often chaotic juncture where a system‚Äôs single, coherent path fractures into two or more distinct futures. This is not a failure, but a fundamental dynamic of evolution. It is a **coherence crisis**...

    A watershed is not a breakdown; it is a birth. It is the universe refusing to be a single story, choosing instead to become a library. It is the shattering that precedes all reinvention.
  law: |
    At a watershed, a system resolves into a new path `j` with a probability `P(branch_j) ‚àù exp(S_p(j) / Œì_crisis)`, where `S_p(j)` is the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian along the new path and `Œì_crisis` is the peak Temporal Pressure at the moment of choice.
  philosophy: |
    A watershed event is the fundamental dynamic of evolution and novelty, representing the point of maximum leverage where a single choice can write a new world into being by shattering a monolithic reality into a plurality of possibilities.
pirouette_definition: |
  A critical juncture where a system's single, coherent path fractures into two or more distinct futures. Driven by rising Temporal Pressure (Œì), the event manifests as a three-stage process: a pre-cusp `Coherence Instability` (degrading Laminar Flow), a cusp of `Turbulent Crucible` (coherence collapse), and a post-cusp `Divergent Resolution` (re-laminarization along a new trajectory). This process physically partitions the system's Wound Channel, creating divergent histories.

          Monitor a system's coherence metric (Ki) and flow state via Flow Diagnostics (DYNA-001). A watershed event is identified by a temporal sequence: 1) Sustained decrease in the primary Ki metric and increasing instability (flickering). 2) A sharp, transient spike in turbulent energy indicators. 3) The stabilization of a new, distinct Ki metric on a divergent trajectory.

      A Watershed Event is a critical, creative, and often chaotic juncture where a system‚Äôs single, coherent path fractures into two or more distinct futures. This is not a failure, but a fundamental dynamic of evolution. It is a coherence crisis where a system‚Äôs resonant pattern (Ki) can no longer be sustained, forcing it to resolve its instability by becoming something new. It is the point where a single reality branches into a plurality of possibilities.

    excerpt: |
      At a watershed, the singular Wound Channel physically splits, leaving a Y-shaped scar in the geometry of spacetime. The history leading up to the cusp remains a shared trunk, but from the moment of divergence, two or more new Wound Channels are carved. The system's memory and identity are partitioned. Their echoes begin to differ, their identities drift apart, and their futures are written in separate books.

        A watershed event is a direct physical analogue to a bifurcation in a dynamical system, where a small, smooth change in a control parameter (Œº, analogous to Temporal Pressure Œì) causes a sudden qualitative or topological change in the system's behavior, such as a stable fixed point splitting into two. This mapping provides a robust mathematical toolkit for modeling the event's critical cusp and the splitting of future trajectories.

  disambiguation: |
    The term "Watershed Event" replaces the older, more passive term "Fork". "Fork" implied a simple geometric split, whereas "Watershed Event" correctly frames the phenomenon as a dynamic, pressure-driven crisis and resolution, emphasizing the turbulent, energetic transition at the cusp.

# Watershed Event

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A critical juncture where a system's single, coherent path fractures into two or more distinct futures. Driven by rising Temporal Pressure (Œì), the event manifests as a three-stage process: a pre-cusp `Coherence Instability` (degrading Laminar Flow), a cusp of `Turbulent Crucible` (coherence collapse), and a post-cusp `Divergent Resolution` (re-laminarization along a new trajectory). This process physically partitions the system's Wound Channel, creating divergent histories.

## EFT-First Summary
A Watershed Event is the physical manifestation of a **bifurcation point** in the system's dynamical evolution. As a control parameter, analogous to Temporal Pressure (Œì), crosses a critical threshold, the system's potential landscape (derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian ùìõ_p) flattens or develops multiple minima. This forces the system out of a single stable trajectory and into a probabilistic choice between multiple new stable paths, fundamentally altering its future state space. This process is common in nonlinear dynamics and is a key mechanism for generating complexity.
