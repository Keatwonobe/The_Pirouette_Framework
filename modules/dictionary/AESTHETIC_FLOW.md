  art: |
    The current of the self meets the riverbed of art. This communion can be a graceful waltz, a violent cascade through rapids, or a descent into a dead, silent pool.
  law: |
    The quality of aesthetic experience is determined by the degree of synchronization between the observer's and the artwork's coherence manifolds, manifesting as one of three distinct dynamical regimes: laminar (synchronous, negentropic), turbulent (dissipative, high-friction), or stagnant (decoupled, zero-gradient).
  philosophy: |
    Aesthetic Flow provides a dynamical language to diagnose the observer-artwork coupling in real time. It shifts aesthetic judgment from being a static property of an object to a temporal property of a resonant interaction, making beauty a measure of process, not of state.
pirouette_definition: |
  Aesthetic Flow is a diagnostic category describing the qualitative dynamics of an observer's consciousness during a Resonant Dialogue with a coherence engine (artwork). It is classified into three primary states based on the degree of synchronization and cognitive friction between the observer's and the artwork's Ki patterns:
  - **Laminar Flow:** Effortless, negentropic synchrony creating a sense of timelessness and porous self/art boundary. The 'aesthetic trance'.
  - **Turbulent Flow:** Dissonant coupling creating high cognitive friction, struggle, and intellectual or emotional challenge.
  - **Stagnant Flow:** Decoupled or low-information resonance where the observer's attention finds no gradient to follow, leading to boredom.

        outline: |
          An observer is exposed to an artwork while neuro-physiological signals (EEG, HRV, electrodermal activity) are monitored. Subjective reports of immersion, effort, and valence are collected concurrently. The flow state is classified by correlating the objective physiological data (e.g., alpha-band coherence, sympathetic/parasympathetic balance) with the subjective experience.

    excerpt: |
      This coupling can induce powerful flow states and, in the most profound cases, trigger a transformative Alchemical Union (CORE-012). The impact of this synthesis is not fleeting; it carves a permanent geometric scar—an Aesthetic Wound Channel (CORE-011)—into the observer's being.

        The Reynolds number in fluid dynamics is a dimensionless quantity predicting flow patterns. The transition from smooth, orderly laminar flow to chaotic, dissipative turbulent flow as Re increases provides a powerful conceptual analogy for the transition from the "State of Grace" to the "State of Struggle" in aesthetic experience. Stagnant flow corresponds to a zero-gradient or zero-velocity field (Re ≈ 0).

    Distinguish from the general psychological concept of "Flow State" (Csikszentmihalyi). Pirouette's Aesthetic Flow is a broader dynamical systems category that includes the classic Flow State as its *laminar regime*. Crucially, the Pirouette model also defines and analyzes non-optimal or dissonant states (Turbulent, Stagnant) as integral parts of the same aesthetic interaction, not as failures to achieve flow.

# Aesthetic Flow

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Aesthetic Flow is a diagnostic category describing the qualitative dynamics of an observer's consciousness during a Resonant Dialogue with a coherence engine (artwork). It is classified into three primary states based on the degree of synchronization and cognitive friction between the observer's and the artwork's Ki patterns:
- **Laminar Flow:** Effortless, negentropic synchrony creating a sense of timelessness and porous self/art boundary. The 'aesthetic trance'.
- **Turbulent Flow:** Dissonant coupling creating high cognitive friction, struggle, and intellectual or emotional challenge.
- **Stagnant Flow:** Decoupled or low-information resonance where the observer's attention finds no gradient to follow, leading to boredom.

## EFT-First Summary
Aesthetic Flow provides a phenomenological parallel to the principles of fluid dynamics, conceptually mapped via a term like the Reynolds number (Re). The "State of Grace" corresponds to a low-Re, laminar regime where the observer's consciousness couples smoothly and efficiently with the artwork's informational field. The "State of Struggle" represents a high-Re, turbulent regime, characterized by dissipative, high-friction cognitive processing. The "State of Boredom" maps to a zero-gradient field with no coherent current, or Re ≈ 0. This framework allows for a physics-first analysis of subjective aesthetic experience.
