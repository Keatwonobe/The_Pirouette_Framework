  art: |
    Color is time’s threefold braid. When its background structure condenses into a sea of quantum knots, flux lines are squeezed into tight cords. The energy of these cords grows with their length, a signature of inexorable temporal tension.
  law: |
    The expectation value of a large Wilson loop ⟨W_R(C)⟩ in a color representation R with non-zero N-ality decays exponentially with the minimal area A(C) bounded by the loop C. The decay constant, σ_R, is the string tension for that representation.
  philosophy: |
    The area law is the macroscopic, order-parameter-like signature of color confinement. It transforms the abstract microscopic dynamics of center-vortex condensation into a concrete, measurable force law, providing the primary bridge between the Pirouette mechanism and lattice QCD observables.
pirouette_definition: |
  The exponential suppression of the Wilson loop expectation value, `⟨W_R(C)⟩ ∼ exp(-σ_R A(C))`, for large loops C. This behavior is the defining feature of confinement in Pirouette's SU(3)_c model. It is a direct consequence of the condensation of (Z_3) center vortices, which disorders the vacuum and forces color-electric flux into narrow tubes. The string tension `σ` is not a fundamental constant but a derived quantity scaling with the temporal-color frame stiffness `κ_3` and the Γ-coherence length `ξ_Γ` as `σ ∼ κ_3 / ξ_Γ²`.
operational_definition:
  units: The exponent `σ_R A(C)` is dimensionless. String tension `σ_R` has units of energy per unit length, or force (typically MeV/fm or GeV²). Area `A(C)` is length squared.

        outline: |
          1. Generate an ensemble of SU(3) gauge field configurations on a 4D spacetime lattice.
          2. For each configuration, construct rectangular Wilson loops `W(L, T)` of varying spatial size `L` and temporal size `T`.
          3. Compute the ensemble average `⟨W(L, T)⟩`.
          4. For large `T`, extract the static quark potential `V(L)` from the decay: `⟨W(L, T)⟩ ∼ exp(-V(L)T)`.
          5. For large `L`, the potential grows linearly: `V(L) ∼ σL`. The slope `σ` is the string tension. The area law is confirmed if `ln(⟨W(L, T)⟩) ∝ -LT` for large loops.
        expected_signals: [A linear potential V(L) at large distances, A plateau in Creutz ratios for large loops.]
        pitfalls: [Contamination from excited states (requiring large T), Finite lattice size effects, Discretization errors (requiring continuum extrapolation).]

    excerpt: |
      The center of SU(3) is (Z_3={e^{2\pi i k/3}}). **Temporal-color frames** admit **center-valued holonomies**; spatial loops can trap a center phase → **center vortices**. When these vortices **condense**, Wilson loops in representations with nonzero **N-ality** obey an **area law**: `⟨W_R(C)⟩ ∼ exp(-σ_R A(C))`.
  - module: DYNA-COLOR-001
    excerpt: |
      **Area law failure:** absence of an area law for nonzero N-ality representations undercuts the center-vortex condensation premise. **Wrong (σ) scaling:** lattice determination of (σ) that cannot be reconciled with any `(κ_3/ξ_Γ²)` within Pirouette priors falsifies the mechanical link.

        The Pirouette area law is intended to be operationally and numerically identical to the area law for Wilson loops measured in lattice simulations of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory. This is the standard, first-principles definition and verification of quark confinement in the Standard Model.

  disambiguation: |
    The "Area Law" of confinement refers to the behavior of Wilson loops (a gauge theory observable). It should not be confused with the "area law" for entanglement entropy, a common feature in the ground states of local quantum field theories, which states that entropy scales with the boundary area of a subregion, not its volume.

# Area Law

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The exponential suppression of the Wilson loop expectation value, `⟨W_R(C)⟩ ∼ exp(-σ_R A(C))`, for large loops C. This behavior is the defining feature of confinement in Pirouette's SU(3)_c model. It is a direct consequence of the condensation of (Z_3) center vortices, which disorders the vacuum and forces color-electric flux into narrow tubes. The string tension `σ` is not a fundamental constant but a derived quantity scaling with the temporal-color frame stiffness `κ_3` and the Γ-coherence length `ξ_Γ` as `σ ∼ κ_3 / ξ_Γ²`.

## EFT-First Summary
The Area Law is the direct operational signature of quark confinement, identical to the phenomenon measured in lattice QCD. In this standard picture, the expectation value of a Wilson loop—a gauge-invariant observable tracking the phase a heavy quark-antiquark pair would accumulate—decays exponentially with the area spanned by the pair's worldlines. This implies a linear rising potential and an unbreakable, constant force at large distances, explaining why quarks are never observed in isolation.
