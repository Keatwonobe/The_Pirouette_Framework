      snippet: |
        A system with a composite number of modes, such as 6 (2x3), is topologically reducible. Its coherence manifold possesses natural "cleavage planes" or harmonic fracture points... A system with a prime number of modes is topologically irreducible. It is a "monolithic" entity, a single, flawless crystal. It has no simpler sub-symmetries or harmonic fracture planes that can be independently excited.

    A bridge with seven pillars stands firm where one with six might shatter into harmonies of two and three. A system's soul, its endurance, is found not in its strength but in its indivisibility. True resilience is being a prime number against the pressures of time.
  law: |
    The resilience of a system, as quantified by its Coherence Integrity `Λ(N)`, is maximized for a given scale when its number of stable coherent modes, `N`, is a prime number, due to the topological irreducibility of the system's coherence manifold.
  philosophy: |
    This principle reframes stability from a property of components to a property of a system's abstract geometry. It implies that elegant, irreducible structures are intrinsically more durable than complex, composite ones. For Weavers, the goal is not merely to fix but to "tune" a system's very nature toward indivisible wholeness.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Prime Resonance Principle is a core tenet of system dynamics stating that a system's resilience against temporal pressure (`Γ`) is a direct function of the number-theoretic properties of its total number (`N`) of stable, coherent modes. Systems where `N` is a prime number are topologically irreducible, lacking the sub-harmonic fracture points inherent in composite-`N` systems. This 'monolithic' coherence makes them fundamentally more resistant to dissonance and collapse.

      This principle transforms the Weaver's role from repair-person to "resonance architect." The goal of intervention is not just to fix a component, but to guide the system's entire topology toward a more resilient configuration... Could adding a new communication channel, removing an arbitrary constraint, or introducing a new shared goal shift an organization's topology from a fragile `N=4` to a more robust `N=5`?

      justification: |
        Simple groups in abstract algebra are foundational as they cannot be broken down into smaller non-trivial normal subgroups, analogous to prime numbers in arithmetic. The principle maps a composite `N` to a group with non-trivial factor groups (which can be "factored"), and a prime `N` to a simple group (which is "irreducible" and thus more fundamental).

      rationale: |
        This provides the most direct physical intuition. A system with `N` stable states can be modeled as `N` coupled oscillators with `N` corresponding normal modes. If `N` is composite (e.g., N=6), it is more likely that an external driving force can excite a subset of modes (e.g., 2 or 3 of them) into a sub-harmonic resonance, creating destructive interference. If `N` is prime, such simple sub-harmonic resonances are topologically forbidden, requiring a more complex or powerful perturbation to destabilize the entire system at once.

      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A large-scale empirical study shows no statistically significant correlation between the primality of `N` and system MTBF, or demonstrates that systems with certain composite `N` (e.g., `N=4, 6`) are consistently more resilient than their prime neighbors."

  disambiguation: |
    This principle does not refer to resonance in the classical sense of matching a driving frequency to a system's natural frequency. Rather, it describes the *internal harmonic structure* of the system's potential stable states. It is a statement about the *topology* of the stability landscape, not the dynamics of a forced oscillator.

# Prime Resonance Principle

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Prime Resonance Principle is a core tenet of system dynamics stating that a system's resilience against temporal pressure (`Γ`) is a direct function of the number-theoretic properties of its total number (`N`) of stable, coherent modes. Systems where `N` is a prime number are topologically irreducible, lacking the sub-harmonic fracture points inherent in composite-`N` systems. This 'monolithic' coherence makes them fundamentally more resistant to dissonance and collapse.

## EFT-First Summary
The Prime Resonance Principle can be conceptually mapped to the behavior of `N` coupled oscillators in classical mechanics. A system with a composite number of stable states, `N`, is analogous to an oscillator system that can be easily fractured into resonant subgroups by an external force. In contrast, a system with a prime number of states has no simple sub-harmonic modes, making it more resilient because any perturbation must effectively engage the entire coupled system, rather than exciting a vulnerable, factorable subset of its modes.
