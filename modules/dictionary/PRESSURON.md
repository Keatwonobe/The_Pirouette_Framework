    A cosmic metronome, its early, rapid ticking builds the scaffolding of galaxies. As its energy fades, the ticks slow into a long, final breath, pushing the cosmos apart.
  law: |
    The mass of the pressuron, m_Γ, sets the characteristic Hubble rate H at which the parent Γ field's dynamics transition from a pressureless, oscillating fluid (w_Γ ≈ 0) to a slow-rolling field governed by its potential's shallow tail (w_Γ ≈ -1).
  philosophy: |
    The pressuron provides a unified microphysical origin for both dark matter and dark energy, aiming to resolve the coincidence problem not through fine-tuning, but through a single, dynamical, symmetry-compliant transition in the late universe.
pirouette_definition: |
  The pressuron is the quantum excitation of the Γ field, possessing a mass m_Γ. Cosmologically, the classical Γ field acts as a unified dark sector fluid. In the early universe (when H ≫ m_Γ), the field is frozen by Hubble friction. When H ~ m_Γ, it begins to oscillate, and its time-averaged equation of state behaves as pressureless matter (w_Γ ≈ 0). At late times, as the oscillation amplitude redshifts, the field's evolution becomes dominated by a shallow tail in its potential V(Γ), causing it to slow-roll and behave as dark energy (w_Γ ≈ -1).

          Implement the dynamics of the Γ field (background and linear perturbations) into a Boltzmann code like CLASS or CAMB. Perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to fit the model's free parameters (e.g., m_Γ, V_tail_mu, Gamma_ini) to a combination of cosmological datasets, primarily Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) luminosity distances. The posterior distribution for m_Γ constitutes its measurement.

    excerpt: |
      Γ is a classical, coherently oscillating scalar whose quanta (“pressurons”) have mass m_Γ. The cosmological mechanism is **misalignment**: Γ starts displaced from its minimum in the early universe; Hubble friction freezes it (Γ̇≈0) until H≈m_Γ, after which Γ oscillates and time‑averages to a **pressureless fluid**. Coherence length is set by the classical field, not the Compton wavelength.
  - module: COSMO-003
    excerpt: |
      The coincidence problem is addressed by a **tracker/attractor tail** appended to the quadratic core of V(Γ). As Γ amplitude redshifts, the field probes the shallow tail; slow‑roll sets in with tracker behavior that naturally turns on when ρ_m drops below a scale set by the tail's energy scale μ, not by an arbitrary time.

        For V(Γ) ≈ ½ m_Γ² Γ², the equation Γ̈ + 3HΓ̇ + m_Γ²Γ = 0 describes a coherently oscillating scalar field whose energy density redshifts as ρ_Γ ∝ a⁻³, mimicking cold dark matter.
      justification: |
        In the early universe (H > m_Γ), the Γ field's dynamics are identical to that of a misaligned axion or ALP. It begins oscillating when its mass is comparable to the Hubble rate and subsequently behaves as a pressureless fluid, providing a candidate for cold dark matter.

        At late times, the Γ field's evolution is dominated by the shallow tail of its potential, causing it to slow-roll. A slow-rolling scalar field driving cosmic acceleration is the definition of a quintessence model for dark energy. The pressuron model unifies the ALP and quintessence concepts into a single field.

    The "pressuron" is the quantum of the field, but the relevant cosmological phenomenology is governed by the dynamics of the classical, coherent scalar field Γ. The large-scale homogeneity of the field is an inheritance from inflationary initial conditions, not a property derived from the pressuron's Compton wavelength.

# Pressuron

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The pressuron is the quantum excitation of the Γ field, possessing a mass m_Γ. Cosmologically, the classical Γ field acts as a unified dark sector fluid. In the early universe (when H ≫ m_Γ), the field is frozen by Hubble friction. When H ~ m_Γ, it begins to oscillate, and its time-averaged equation of state behaves as pressureless matter (w_Γ ≈ 0). At late times, as the oscillation amplitude redshifts, the field's evolution becomes dominated by a shallow tail in its potential V(Γ), causing it to slow-roll and behave as dark energy (w_Γ ≈ -1).

## EFT-First Summary
The Pressuron model provides a unified description of the dark sector by mapping to two well-known effective field theory concepts. In the early universe, the Γ-field behaves identically to an **Axion-Like Particle (ALP)**, where its coherent oscillations around a quadratic potential minimum mimic Cold Dark Matter (redshifting as a⁻³). In the late universe, the field's evolution is governed by a shallow potential tail, causing it to slow-roll and drive cosmic acceleration, which is the definition of **Quintessence**. The pressuron mass, m_Γ, sets the cosmic time for the transition from the matter-dominated (ALP-like) to the dark energy-dominated (Quintessence-like) phase.
