      snippet: |
        Defines the universal, time-first data interchange protocol for all Pirouette-compliant systems. It replaces the old triaxial RSI packet with a time-first 'Chronoscript' record which captures a system's state as a direct snapshot of its Pirouette Lagrangian...

  art: |
    The universe writes its own autobiography one moment at a time. The Chronoscript is the paper upon which the dance is written, an unbroken thread connecting the raw chaos of reality to the clarifying lens of the framework.
  law: |
    Data generated by live observation and computational simulation must be structurally indistinguishable to any consuming process. This principle of Observational Parity is enforced by strict schema validation at all ingress and egress points.
  philosophy: |
    To unify human intuition and machine calculation as equally valid instruments for inquiry. By creating a common language for observation and simulation, the Chronoscript fuels a self-improving (autopoietic) cycle where data begets insight, which in turn begets better data.
pirouette_definition: |
  The universal, time-first data interchange protocol for all Pirouette-compliant systems. A Chronoscript record is a discrete, timestamped JSON object that captures a system's instantaneous state as a direct snapshot of its Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`), ensuring Observational Parity between live observation and computational simulation. It serves as the fundamental unit of information for logging, analysis, and auditing within the framework.

        outline: |
          A Pirouette-compliant instrument (for `observation`) or computational model (for `simulation`) samples the target system's state at a discrete point in time. It measures the fundamental components of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`K_œÑ` and `V_Œì`) and assembles them, along with provenance metadata, into a JSON object conforming to the Chronoscript schema. The completed record is then transmitted to a data stream or log.
        expected_signals: [A valid JSON object passing Chronoscript v2.0 schema validation.]
        pitfalls: [Non-monotonic timestamps for a given entity, inclusion of derived values (e.g., `Lp`) in the `lagrangian_state`, physically impossible values (e.g., `pirouette_cycle_œÑp` ‚â§ 0), missing `metadata_hash` when `metadata` is present.]

    excerpt: |
      The Weaver's Chronoscript protocol establishes a single, unified, and time-first data contract. Its purpose is to guarantee **Observational Parity**: the principle that human intuition and machine calculation are two equally valid instruments for exploring reality. A time-stream of data from any compliant source‚Äîwhether a live observation of a human system or a high-frequency numerical simulation‚Äîcan be ingested and understood by the same analytical tools.
  - module: DOMA-029
    excerpt: |
      This protocol is the direct instrumentation of the framework's central equation. The `lagrangian_state` object is the discrete, digital representation of the components of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`) as defined in `CORE-006`. A time-stream of Chronoscript records is a sampled approximation of the system's "action" integral, `S_p = ‚à´ ùìõ_p dt`, which a system naturally evolves to maximize.

        `Log = {timestamp, source, payload}`
      justification: |
        The Chronoscript is a specialized, structured format for time-series data. Like general-purpose formats (e.g., JSON logs, Prometheus metrics), it captures state at a point in time. Its distinction lies in the rigid, physically-grounded schema of its payload, which is fixed to the components of the Pirouette Lagrangian.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A stream of Chronoscript records from a simulation is indistinguishable in format and semantics from a stream from a live observation, allowing for interchangeability in downstream analysis tools."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "An analyst or automated tool (e.g., INST-NALY-001) can reliably distinguish `observation` from `simulation` records without reading the `source_type` field, implying a structural or semantic discrepancy has been introduced by a producer."
      status: supported
      links: [DOMA-029, INST-NALY-001]
    - statement: "For any given `entity_id`, timestamps in a Chronoscript stream must be strictly increasing."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "A valid, causally-sound scenario is found where a compliant system produces out-of-order timestamps for a single entity, violating the principle of monotonicity."

naming_notes:
  collisions: []
  disambiguation: |
    "Chronoscript" should not be confused with a generic "log file" or "event." It is a specific, atomic data record with a mandatory structure tied directly to the Pirouette Lagrangian. It represents a complete state snapshot, not just a discrete event.
