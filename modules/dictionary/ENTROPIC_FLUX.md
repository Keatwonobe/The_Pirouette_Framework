        This instrument measures the rate of this entropy generation, termed **Entropic Flux (Ṡ)**. This is the quantifiable signature of a system fighting itself, a direct measure of its inefficiency.

  art: |
    The sound of a system arguing with itself. It is the quantifiable signature of a system fighting its own nature, the heat generated by grinding gears, the static in a once-clear signal.
  law: |
    Entropic Flux (Ṡ) is the non-negative rate of coherence loss, proportional to the product of environmental pressure (Γ), internal dissonance (1 - Tₐ), and rhythmic instability (Δωₖ)². It is zero only for systems in perfect Laminar Flow.
  philosophy: |
    Entropic Flux measures the cost of deviation from a system's most elegant path. It makes the abstract mathematics of coherence tangible and accountable, serving as a mirror that reflects the health of our creations and our duty to build well.
pirouette_definition: |
  The rate of irreversible entropy generation within a system, serving as a direct, real-time measure of its operational inefficiency, friction, and deviation from a state of Maximal Coherence. It quantifies the energy dissipated into non-productive, chaotic processes as a result of Turbulent or Stagnant Flow.
operational_definition:
  units: Coherence Loss Units per second (CLU/s), equivalent to Joules per second (J/s) or Watts (W).

      - name: Coherence Audit
        outline: |
          1.  Establish a "Laminar Baseline" by measuring Ṡ under minimal, controlled stress (Γ → 0), where Ṡ ≈ 0.
          2.  Deploy a Coherence Meter under normal operating conditions to continuously measure the system's primary resonant pattern.
          3.  The Meter's computation layer applies the flux equation Ṡ ∝ Γ ⋅ (1 - Tₐ) ⋅ (Δωₖ)² to the signal.
          4.  The output stream of Ṡ is integrated over time and cryptographically signed into a Coherence Ledger (`.clog`) file for attestation.
        expected_signals: [phase noise, signal jitter, packet delay variation, linguistic disfluency rates]
        pitfalls: [improper baseline calibration (Ṡ_base ≠ 0), misattribution of entropy spikes to incorrect causal triggers]

  - module: DOMA-128
    excerpt: |
      The Coherence Ledger is a protocol and a toolkit for quantifying a system's "fever." It measures the friction and noise generated when a system's flow becomes Turbulent or Stagnant, translating the abstract concept of entropy generation into a hard, undeniable metric.
  - module: DOMA-128
    excerpt: |
      The Entropic Flux (Ṡ) measured by the Coherence Ledger is directly proportional to the **"coherence gap"**—the difference between the system's actual, measured Lagrangian value and the theoretical maximum it could achieve in its environment. A reading from the Coherence Ledger is therefore a direct measurement of the *cost of deviation* from the system's own most elegant path of existence.

      equation_hint: |
        Ṡ ∝ σ = Σᵢ Jᵢ Xᵢ
      justification: |
        Both Ṡ and σ quantify the rate of irreversible entropy generation due to dissipative processes within a system. The quadratic dependence on deviation terms in the Pirouette model (Δωₖ)² is characteristic of dissipation functions in thermodynamics, where production is often proportional to the square of a thermodynamic flux (e.g., heat flow, electric current). Ṡ is the Pirouette Framework's specific instrumentation of this universal physical concept.

  claims:
    - statement: "For any system not undergoing a coherent, externally driven ordering process, Entropic Flux (Ṡ) is non-negative (Ṡ ≥ 0)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "The sustained measurement of a statistically significant Ṡ < 0 in an isolated or steady-state system. This would imply the system is spontaneously reducing its own internal disorder without coherent work being done on it, violating the Principle of Coherence Degradation (CORE-013)."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol Ṡ is standard for the time derivative of entropy in physics, which is a desirable alignment, not a collision.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from total entropy (S), which is a state function representing accumulated disorder. Entropic Flux (Ṡ) is a rate function, measuring the *process* of becoming more disordered per unit time. A system can have high S but low Ṡ (a stagnant but stable mess) or low S but high Ṡ (a coherent system rapidly descending into chaos).
