        - **Barrier finiteness**: curvature growth saturates at \( \omega_c \) (prevents singularities).
  editors: [Auto-Agent]

triad:
  art: |
    The frequency at which the fabric of spacetime stiffens, refusing to tear into a singularity. It is the hum of the barrier, the fundamental tone that separates the smooth sea of General Relativity from the crystalline or turbulent depths of a coherent core.
  law: |
    All physical deviations from General Relativity in the strong-gravity regime, such as gravitational-wave dispersion or tidal deformability, are suppressed by powers of (ω/ω_c)², where ω is the probe frequency. A detection of unsuppressed, low-frequency deviations from GR would falsify models governed by ω_c.
  philosophy: |
    ω_c embodies the principle of barrier finiteness, replacing the infinite collapse of a singularity with a physical saturation scale. It serves as the universal coupling constant for all new interior physics, ensuring that corrections to GR are weak at low energies and preserving single-metric universality (SR-5).
pirouette_definition: |
  The Critical Frequency, ω_c, is the fundamental energy scale inherent to the temporal medium that establishes a finite upper bound on spacetime curvature, thereby regularizing would-be gravitational singularities. It governs the strength of all physical effects originating from black hole interior structures, with deviations from General Relativity—such as gravitational wave dispersion, echoes, and tidal response—universally suppressed by powers of the ratio (ω/ω_c)², where ω is the probe frequency.

    - name: ω_c
      meaning: Critical Frequency scale, marking the onset of barrier finiteness effects.
      dimensions: T⁻¹
      default_range: Contextual; assumed to be near-Planckian, well above typical astrophysical frequencies (e.g., > 10²⁰ Hz).

    procedures:
      - name: Gravitational Wave Ringdown Dephasing
        outline: |
          Measure the frequency-dependent phase evolution of a black hole ringdown signal across multiple quasinormal modes (QNMs). Fit the observed phase φ(ω) to the GR prediction plus a correction term: φ(ω) = φ_GR(ω) + κ(ω/ω_c)². The coefficient of the ω² term provides a measurement of 1/ω_c².
        expected_signals: [A quadratic-in-frequency phase shift Δφ_GW, a slight broadening of high-frequency QNM peaks.]
        pitfalls: [Low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can mimic phase noise, degeneracy with environmental effects, requires resolving multiple high-overtone QNMs to establish the ω² dependence.]

  - module: DYNA-BH-INT-001
    excerpt: |
      Model black-hole interiors as **new phases of the temporal medium**... replacing GR singularities with **finite** Γ-structured states... **Grounding**: emergent metric & constitutive law from SUBST-001; GR hydrodynamic limit; GW sector (2 TT pols, luminal; dispersion only at (ω/ω_c)^2).
  - module: DYNA-BH-INT-001
    excerpt: |
      **Phase shift through Γ-core (your lighthouse):**
      \[
      \Delta\phi_{\rm GW} \simeq \kappa \left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_c}\right)^2
      \int_0^{r_\ast}\!dr\, \big(\partial_r \Gamma(r)\big)^2 ,
      \]
      \(\kappa\) fixed by the response-kernel→metric dictionary. (Luminal in IR; correction only at barrier order.)

  candidates:
    - target: UV Cutoff (Λ_UV)
      domain: EFT
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        ω_c acts as an effective ultraviolet cutoff for the gravitational theory. In the low-energy effective field theory (GR), curvature is unbounded, but the full theory described by Pirouette introduces ω_c as the scale where new physics (e.g., Γ-field dynamics) becomes relevant and regularizes high-curvature behavior.
      confidence: 0.8
    - target: Debye Frequency (ω_D)
      domain: CM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      equation_hint: |
        Dispersion relation: ω(k)² ≈ c_s²k² (1 - ω²/ω_D²)
      justification: |
        In solid-state physics, the Debye frequency is the maximum frequency of lattice vibrations (phonons). Analogously, ω_c represents a maximum scale for curvature dynamics, beyond which the continuum spacetime description breaks down into a different physical phase (e.g., a 'Planck Crystal' core).

      falsifier: "Detection of any low-frequency (ω << ω_c) effect from a BH interior that scales as (ω/ω_c)⁰ or (ω/ω_c)¹, such as large static tidal Love numbers or non-dispersive GW echoes."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the characteristic frequency of a quasinormal mode (ω_QNM). ω_c is a fundamental constant of the underlying medium, whereas ω_QNM is a derived property of a specific black hole's mass and spin. All ω_QNM for astrophysical black holes are expected to be much smaller than ω_c.
