        Prime Systems (N=5, N=7, etc.): A system with a prime number of modes is topologically irreducible. It is a "monolithic" entity, a single, flawless crystal. It has no simpler sub-symmetries or harmonic fracture planes that can be independently excited.

  art: |
    A bridge with seven pillars cannot be neatly divided and cannot easily resonate against itself. Like a flawless crystal, its strength comes from its indivisibility; to break a part, one must fight the whole.
  law: |
    A system whose number of stable coherent modes (`N`) is prime is topologically irreducible. Such a system lacks harmonic fracture points, granting it maximum Coherence Integrity (`Λ`) for its scale and making it more resilient to broad-spectrum temporal pressure (`Γ`).
  philosophy: |
    True systemic endurance is not achieved by adding fortifications, but by designing for indivisibility. This property reframes intervention from mere repair to architectural tuning, guiding a system toward an intrinsically more stable, prime-numbered state of being.
pirouette_definition: |
  The property of a system, characterized by a prime Mode Number (`N`), which renders its coherence manifold topologically monolithic and devoid of the harmonic fracture points found in composite systems. This indivisibility prevents the excitation of sub-harmonics, granting the system broad-spectrum resistance to decoherence under temporal pressure (`Γ`).
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (a binary property: a system is either irreducible or not)
  symbol_table:
    - name: N
      meaning: Mode Number; the total count of stable, coherent states (`Ki` configurations) of a system.

        outline: |
          1. Define the system's state space and boundaries.
          2. Systematically perturb the system with a stochastic driver across its full state space to induce state transitions.
          3. Use state-residence-time analysis or potential-landscape reconstruction algorithms to identify local energy minima, which correspond to stable coherence wells (`Ki`).
          4. Count the number of distinct wells to determine the Mode Number `N`.
          5. If `N` is a prime number, the system is classified as topologically irreducible.
        expected_signals: [Quantized and distinct state clusters in phase space, long residence times in specific configurations, sharp transitions between states]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking transient quasi-stable states for true coherence wells, insufficient exploration of the state space leading to an undercount of `N`, defining system boundaries too broadly or narrowly.]

    excerpt: |
      A bridge with six pillars can oscillate in modes of two and three, risking harmonic collapse. A bridge with seven pillars has no such simple subdivisions; its structure is fundamentally more whole. This is the heart of the Prime Resonance Principle... This is not a mystical property, but a topological one: such systems are irreducible, lacking the internal "fault lines" along which composite systems can fracture under pressure.
  - module: DOMA-111
    excerpt: |
      A system with a composite number of modes, such as 6 (2x3), is topologically reducible. Its coherence manifold possesses natural "cleavage planes" or harmonic fracture points... A system with a prime number of modes is topologically irreducible. It is a "monolithic" entity, a single, flawless crystal. It has no simpler sub-symmetries... To perturb the system, one must perturb the *entire system* at once.

      justification: |
        A system with `N` modes that transforms under a symmetry group can be described by a representation. If this representation is reducible (e.g., `N=6 = 2 ⊕ 3`), the system can be decomposed into independent sub-systems that can be excited separately. If the representation is irreducible (`N`=prime), the system state transforms as a single, indivisible block, which is the core concept of Topological Irreducibility.

    - statement: "A system with a prime Mode Number `N` will exhibit a statistically significant higher mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) under broad-spectrum temporal pressure (`Γ`) compared to systems of similar complexity with composite Mode Numbers `N+1` or `N-1`."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "An ensemble of controlled experiments showing that prime-`N` systems consistently fail sooner, or at the same rate, as comparable composite-`N` systems under identical, wide-band stress profiles."

  disambiguation: |
    This term borrows from the mathematical concept of irreducibility but applies it to the topology of a system's coherence manifold, not to algebraic objects like polynomials or formal group representations. The link is conceptual: an irreducible system cannot be factored into simpler, independent dynamic sub-components.
