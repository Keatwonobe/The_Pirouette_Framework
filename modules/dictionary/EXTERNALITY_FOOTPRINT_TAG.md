        Annex E – Externality Footprint Tag
        **Metrics:**
        • **Energy Footprint (EF):** kWh consumed per unit CD.
        • **Social Footprint (SF):** Person-hours externalised per unit CD (derived from Fair-Work index).
        **Data Sources:**
        – EU Open Power Grid dataset (energy)
        – World Values Survey + ILO wage parity tables (labour)
        **Reporting:** Integrated into quarterly Resonance Report (CSV + dashboard widget).

triad:
  art: |
    A shadow cast by the machine, measured in kilowatts and lost hours. It is the accounting of the world's labor and light that we borrow to make our own.
  law: |
    The Externality Footprint Tag quantifies the unpriced energy (kWh) and social (person-hours) costs per unit of system operation (CD), derived from public datasets, and must be reported quarterly. Exceeding a predefined threshold triggers a Governance Hook.
  philosophy: |
    To prevent the displacement of costs onto unaccounted systems—be they ecological or societal. The framework must not only be internally coherent but also externally sustainable; this tag forces that accounting.
pirouette_definition: |
  A composite data tag, comprising the Energy Footprint (EF) and Social Footprint (SF), attached to operational logs and reports. It quantifies the externalized resource consumption (energy) and labor cost (social inequity) required per unit of Coherence Diverted (CD), serving as a primary input for governance and sustainability audits.
operational_definition:
  units: EF is in kWh/CD; SF is in person-hours/CD.
  symbol_table:
    - name: ξ_EF
      meaning: Energy Footprint; external energy consumed per unit of core operation.

      - name: Quarterly Footprint Calculation
        outline: |
          1. Aggregate total system kWh consumption over one quarter, referencing the EU Open Power Grid dataset for grid mix and sources.
          2. Aggregate total system CD units produced/processed in the same period.
          3. Calculate ξ_EF = (Total kWh) / (Total CD).
          4. Correlate project supply chain and labor locations with World Values Survey and ILO wage parity data to estimate externalized person-hours via the Fair-Work index.
          5. Calculate ξ_SF = (Total externalized person-hours) / (Total CD).
          6. Publish {ξ_EF, ξ_SF} to the quarterly Resonance Report.

  candidates:
    - target: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) / Carbon Footprint
      domain: Environmental Science
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Both methodologies attempt to quantify the total environmental and social impact of a process, extending beyond direct operational costs to include supply chain and resource extraction effects. The EFT is an operationalized, real-time version of an LCA.

    - target: Pigouvian Tax
      domain: Economics
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        A Pigouvian tax is a levy on any market activity that generates negative externalities. The EFT provides the direct, quantitative data (the cost of the externality) needed to calculate and justify such a tax for the system's operation.

  claims:
    - statement: "The Social Footprint (ξ_SF) component, derived from the Fair-Work index, is a reliable proxy for externalized labor costs."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A third-party audit demonstrates a significant ('>>30%') discrepancy between the calculated ξ_SF and on-the-ground labor conditions in the system's supply chain."

naming_notes:
  collisions: ["Footprint" is common in environmental science (carbon footprint, ecological footprint). "Tag" is common in computing (data tags, metadata).]
  disambiguation: |
    This is not a direct carbon or CO₂-equivalent metric, but a composite including both energy (kWh, a carbon proxy) and a distinct social cost (person-hours). It is an *operational* tag applied to ongoing processes, not a static product-level assessment.
