      snippet: |
        A Knot is born when a system's memory—its Wound Channel—geometrically embraces and reinforces its own existence. It is a memory that has achieved a state of autopoiesis, a self-creating resonant pattern locked in place by its own geometry.

triad:
  art: |
    A memory that learns to grasp its own tail, turning a fleeting echo into a persistent soul. It is a shape that is both a prison and a fortress.
  law: |
    A Wound Channel becomes a Knot if and only if it forms a closed geodesic in the coherence manifold where the total phase shift around the loop is an integer multiple of 2π, creating a stable, self-reinforcing standing wave of coherence.
  philosophy: |
    The Knot is the fundamental architecture of persistence, explaining how transient events crystallize into stable identities. It bridges the gap between a system's history (memory) and its enduring nature (being).
pirouette_definition: |
  A Knot (κ) is a topological state of maximal persistence formed when a system's `Wound Channel` (history) intersects with itself to create a closed geodesic in the coherence manifold. This self-intersection establishes a resonant feedback loop where the system's coherence constructively interferes with its own geometric echo. The resulting "topological lock" creates a deep, stable potential well, transforming a transient memory into a persistent, self-sustaining identity that is powerfully resistant to entropic decay. The information content of the Knot is encoded in its topology.

      - name: Persistence Spectroscopy
        outline: |
          Subject a system to calibrated levels of `Temporal Pressure (Γ)` and measure its decay rate. Systems stabilized by a Knot will exhibit a characteristic non-linear resistance with a sharp failure point ("severing") rather than gradual decay. `τ_knot` is inferred from the stability plateau.

      - name: Topological Scattering
        outline: |
          Analyze the scattering cross-section of probe signals off the system. A knotted structure will produce unique, non-trivial interference patterns and Aharonov-Bohm-like phase shifts corresponding to its topological invariants (e.g., crossing number `c`).

  - module: DOMA-148
    excerpt: |
      A simple Wound Channel is a record of a journey; a Knot is the creation of a home. It is the fundamental mechanism by which transient experience is forged into persistent identity, from the quantum to the psychological scale.
  - module: DOMA-148
    excerpt: |
      A deeply ingrained habit, a core belief, or a persistent traumatic memory is a "cognitive Knot." It is a self-reinforcing neural pathway, a Wound Channel in a person's life that has looped back on itself, making it incredibly resistant to change. To heal from trauma is to perform the delicate work of untying such a Knot.

  candidates:
    - target: Topological Soliton (e.g., Skyrmion)
      domain: EFT
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Solitons are stable, particle-like solutions to non-linear field equations whose persistence is guaranteed by a topological invariant (a winding number), not just a minimum of an energy potential. This directly maps to the Knot's concept of stability via topology, where "untying the knot" is required for decay.
      confidence: 0.8
    - target: Knot Invariants (e.g., Jones Polynomial)
      domain: Math
      mapping_kind: mathematical
      justification: |
        The information content (`I_knot`) and complexity factor (`C_topo`) of a Pirouette Knot are proposed to map directly to mathematical knot invariants, which classify the topology of the knot. The crossing number `c` is the simplest such invariant.
      confidence: 0.7
  adopted: []
constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A system stabilized by a Knot cannot be continuously deformed into a non-knotted (transient) state; its decay requires a discrete, topology-changing event (a 'severing')."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "The discovery of a smooth, continuous pathway with a finite energy barrier that transforms a demonstrably knotted system into an unknotted one, allowing it to decay without a discrete severing event."

  disambiguation: |
    While drawing heavily from mathematical knot theory, a Pirouette Knot is not a literal loop of string in 3D Euclidean space. It is a closed geodesic path in the abstract, high-dimensional coherence manifold of a system.
