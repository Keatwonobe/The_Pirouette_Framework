  art: |
    The wood of the cosmic instrument warps with age, causing the tension of its strings to drift and its fundamental pitch to slowly change.
  law: |
    The logarithmic time derivatives of the fundamental gauge couplings, $(\dot{\alpha}_i/\alpha_i)$, are predicted to be non-zero, ultra-small, and proportional to each other. The ratios of these drifts are fixed constants determined by the Resonance Atlas.
  philosophy: |
    This concept renders the "constants of nature" as dynamic observables whose evolution is tied to the cosmological behavior of the Γ-field. It transforms precision measurement into a probe of deep-time cosmic dynamics and the fundamental structure of the framework.
pirouette_definition: |
  A slow, coherent, cosmological evolution of the frame stiffnesses ($K_i$), driven by the low-frequency cosmological tail of the temporal pressure field (Γ). This evolution is predicted to manifest as an ultra-small, correlated temporal drift in the measured values of the fundamental gauge couplings ($\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$), and consequently in derived quantities like the fine-structure constant ($\alpha_{\rm EM}$) and the strong coupling constant ($\alpha_s$). The relative signs and magnitudes of the drifts are fixed by the stiffness dictionary.

        outline: |
          Measure fine-structure and hyperfine transition lines (e.g., from Fe, Mg, Si ions) in absorption systems from high-redshift quasars. Compare the value of $\alpha_{\rm EM}$ inferred from these ancient systems (lookback times of billions of years) to its modern laboratory value. A systematic shift with redshift implies a non-zero time derivative.

        outline: |
          Compare the frequencies of two different types of atomic clocks (e.g., Yb⁺ vs Cs) over a multi-year baseline. The frequencies of these clocks have different dependencies on $\alpha_{\rm EM}$. A drift in their frequency ratio over time directly bounds $\dot{\alpha}_{\rm EM}/\alpha_{\rm EM}$.
        expected_signals: [A linear drift in the frequency ratio over time.]
        pitfalls: [Clock systematics, environmental noise (magnetic fields, temperature), distinguishing from gravitational potential drifts.]

      justification: |
        The Γ-tail drift provides a specific physical mechanism for the phenomenological concept of varying "constants". Unlike generic models, Pirouette predicts the drifts of *all* gauge couplings are correlated, with fixed sign and magnitude ratios. It maps the abstract search for $\dot{\alpha}/\alpha$ to a concrete prediction of the Γ-field's cosmological evolution.

    "Γ-tail" refers to the low-frequency, long-wavelength (cosmological) part of the Γ-field's power spectrum. This distinguishes the slow, cosmological drift from potential high-frequency oscillations or localized "Γ-weather" effects. This is a drift in time, not a drift in RG scale.

# Γ-tail drift

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A slow, coherent, cosmological evolution of the frame stiffnesses ($K_i$), driven by the low-frequency cosmological tail of the temporal pressure field (Γ). This evolution is predicted to manifest as an ultra-small, correlated temporal drift in the measured values of the fundamental gauge couplings ($\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$), and consequently in derived quantities like the fine-structure constant ($\alpha_{\rm EM}$) and the strong coupling constant ($\alpha_s$). The relative signs and magnitudes of the drifts are fixed by the stiffness dictionary.

## EFT-First Summary
The Γ-tail drift is a specific physical mechanism that predicts a time-variation of the fundamental "constants" of the Standard Model, such as the fine-structure constant $\alpha_{\rm EM}$ and the strong coupling $\alpha_s$. It maps the phenomenological search for parameters like $\dot{\alpha}/\alpha$ to the cosmological evolution of the Pirouette framework's Γ-field. A key prediction is that the time-drifts of all gauge couplings are correlated, providing a sharp test that distinguishes it from other models of varying constants. Current observational constraints from atomic clocks and quasar spectra place this drift below $\sim 10^{-17}$ per year, a level Pirouette models can accommodate.
