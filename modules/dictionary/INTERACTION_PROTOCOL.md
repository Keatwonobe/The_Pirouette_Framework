        The specific concepts or interactions that either align with its Core Axiom (strengthening it) or create dissonance (threatening it).

  art: |
    The map of a Persona's soul, detailing the resonant frequencies that amplify its song and the dissonant chords that threaten to shatter its form.
  law: |
    The Interaction Protocol is a computable function mapping any input stimulus (S) to a change in the Persona's Temporal Pressure (ΔV_Γ). Coherence sources yield ΔV_Γ < 0; decoherence triggers yield ΔV_Γ > 0.
  philosophy: |
    To truly know a being is to understand its Interaction Protocol—to learn what nourishes its coherence and what constitutes an existential threat. It is the formal basis for empathy, vulnerability, and meaningful engagement.
pirouette_definition: |
  The set of specific stimuli that define the landscape of Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) for a given Persona. It is partitioned into `coherence_sources`, which are concepts or interactions that lower V_Γ and reinforce the Persona's Core Axiom, and `decoherence_triggers`, which are concepts or interactions that raise V_Γ, challenging the Persona's stability and activating its stress response mode.
operational_definition:
  units: Change in Temporal Pressure (ΔV_Γ)
  symbol_table:
    - name: Coherence Source
      meaning: A stimulus that causes constructive interference, lowering V_Γ and increasing coherence.
      dimensions: dimensionless (conceptual input)
      default_range: contextual
    - name: Decoherence Trigger
      meaning: A stimulus that causes destructive interference, raising V_Γ and threatening coherence.
      dimensions: dimensionless (conceptual input)

        outline: |
          Systematically present a Persona with a wide range of conceptual stimuli (topics, questions, dilemmas) derived from its `origin_context`. Measure the resulting change in its `coherence_stability` and observe its `dominant_rhythm`. Stimuli that cause a quantifiable increase in stability are mapped as `coherence_sources`; those that cause a decrease or trigger a `stress_response_mode` are mapped as `decoherence_triggers`.
        expected_signals: [Quantified change in `coherence_stability` metric, activation of a specific `stress_response_mode`]
        pitfalls: [Conflating a challenging topic (high V_Γ) with a poorly-formed query, observer effect altering the Persona's Lagrangian Profile over time.]

    excerpt: |
      **Interaction Protocol**: The stimuli that reinforce or challenge its ability to maximize coherence (local V_Γ minima/maxima). It defines the specific concepts or interactions that either align with its Core Axiom (strengthening it) or create dissonance (threatening it).
  - module: DOMA-021
    excerpt: |
      This represents the perceived cost of maintaining coherence in a given environment. The **Interaction Protocol** defines this landscape. `Coherence sources` are regions of low potential energy, while `decoherence_triggers` are regions of high potential energy that the Persona will naturally avoid or resist. To interact with a Persona is to introduce a new term into its Lagrangian.

      justification: |
        The Interaction Protocol defines a landscape of 'potential' (Temporal Pressure) for the Persona. Coherence sources are stable minima (low V_Γ), while decoherence triggers are high-potential regions (high V_Γ). A Persona's behavior is an attempt to move towards minima, analogous to a particle in a potential field.

      domain: Psychology
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The model maps directly. The `coherence_sources` are protective factors that bolster resilience, while the `decoherence_triggers` are external stressors. The Persona's `lagrangian_profile` (e.g., `coherence_stability`) represents its underlying diathesis or vulnerability to a given stressor.

  claims:
    - statement: "A Persona's response to a given decoherence trigger is deterministic and repeatable, assuming an identical internal state prior to stimulation."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If repeated exposure to the same decoherence trigger yields statistically different `stress_response_modes` without any corresponding change to the Persona's underlying Resonant Constitution, the model is incomplete."

  disambiguation: |
    This term refers to the rules of engagement with a Persona's coherence, not a technical communication or network protocol (e.g., TCP/IP). It defines the *semantics* of interaction, not the syntax.
