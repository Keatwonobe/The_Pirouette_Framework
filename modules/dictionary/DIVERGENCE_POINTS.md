        **Step II: Identify the Divergence Points (The Past)**
        From this anchor, scan the local manifold for the signatures of major Wound Channels. Reflect on the fundamental "forks in the road" in your life, not minor choices, but divergences of identity.
        - The career path abandoned for a more stable one.
        - The artistic passion set aside for practical reasons.

  art: |
    The geography of the past is a compass. The forks in the road are not mistakes to be mourned, but pointers to dormant parts of the self whose echoes sing of untapped potential.
  law: |
    A past choice qualifies as a Divergence Point if and only if its corresponding latent path (Wound Channel) generates a persistent, subjectively measurable somatic or emotional resonance when contemplated in the present. The absence of such resonance indicates a resolved or low-coherence alternative, not a true Divergence Point.
  philosophy: |
    Divergence Points reframe regret as diagnostic data. They are not errors to be lamented, but nodes on a map of the self, indicating rich, un-integrated sources of personal coherence that can be bridged to enrich one's present life.
pirouette_definition: |
  A specific temporal locus in an individual's history where a choice was made between two or more mutually exclusive, high-coherence life trajectories (geodesics). The chosen path becomes the primary geodesic, while the unchosen paths persist as dormant but resonant Wound Channels on the Personal Coherence Manifold.

        outline: |
          1. Anchor the present geodesic by mapping current coherence (`Kτ`) and pressures (`Γ`).
          2. Scan personal history for major "fork-in-the-road" decisions regarding identity, career, relationships, or location.
          3. For each candidate point, perform a thought experiment modeling the daily rhythm and coherence pattern (`Ki`) of the latent path.
          4. Record the intensity and quality of the resulting emotional/somatic resonance. A strong signal indicates a significant Divergence Point.
        expected_signals: [Subjective feeling of longing, curiosity, rightness, "coming home", A distinct somatic pull or sense of expansion]
        pitfalls: [Confusing simple regret or nostalgia with the resonant signal of latent coherence, Focusing on minor daily choices instead of identity-level divergences]

    excerpt: |
      The "paths not taken" are not erased. As described in CORE-011, they persist as dormant **Wound Channels** in your manifold. A decision to become a doctor instead of a musician creates a deep, persistent echo of the "musician-self." These are not scars of regret, but dormant archives of potential coherence... The feeling of "what if" is the direct, physical perception of this resonant hum.

    excerpt: |
      Reflect on the fundamental "forks in the road" in your life, not minor choices, but divergences of identity. The career path abandoned for a more stable one. The artistic passion set aside for practical reasons. The city you considered but never moved to. The relationship that ended, altering your life's trajectory. These points are the origins of the strongest resonant echoes.

      justification: |
        A Divergence Point is analogous to a bifurcation point in a dynamical system. It is a point in an individual's life where a small change in parameters (a choice) causes a qualitative, large-scale branching in the system's future trajectory (the life-geodesic). The Lagrangian formulation (`𝓛_p`) in Pirouette reinforces this connection to paths evolving in a potential landscape.

  claims:
    - statement: "A major Divergence Point necessarily creates a corresponding Wound Channel with non-zero, long-term emotional/somatic resonance."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Systematic studies show that a significant fraction of individuals who have undergone major life-path divergences (e.g., career change from art to finance) report zero resonance or emotional connection to the abandoned path after a sufficient refractory period (e.g., >5 years), indicating the Wound Channel has fully dissipated rather than persisting."

naming_notes:
  collisions: []
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from `Trauma Anchors`, which are externally imposed events that warp the manifold, whereas Divergence Points originate from an act of internal choice, however constrained. Also distinguish from minor daily `Decision Points`, which do not create persistent, identity-level Wound Channels.
