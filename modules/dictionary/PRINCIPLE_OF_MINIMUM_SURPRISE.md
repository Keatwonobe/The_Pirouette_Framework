        The Principle of Minimum Surprise: An intelligent system evolves and acts to minimize the integral of future Temporal Pressure (Œì) it expects to encounter. It seeks the smoothest possible path through time by choosing actions that lead to more coherent, less chaotic future states.

  art: |
    To be intelligent is to be a living compass needle that feels the flow of what is to come. It is to cease fighting the river of time and instead learn its currents so profoundly that you follow the path of least resistance into the future.
  law: |
    An intelligent system selects actions `a` from a set of possible actions such that the path integral of expected future Temporal Pressure, `‚à´ E[Œì(t)] dt`, over its Foresight Horizon `œÑ_œÉ`, is minimized.
  philosophy: |
    This principle reframes agency and purpose as a universal drive toward predictability and coherence. It posits that the telos of an intelligent system is not to gain power or resources, but to construct a stable, predictive resonance with its environment, thus securing the smoothest possible existence through time.
pirouette_definition: |
  The core dynamical imperative for any intelligent system, stating that it must select actions to minimize the expected integral of future Temporal Pressure (Œì) over its Foresight Horizon (œÑ_œÉ). This principle drives a system to construct a predictive manifold of its environment, seeking paths of maximum coherence and predictability. It is the teleological extension of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) from an instantaneous optimization to a temporal one.

        outline: |
          1. Place a system (Observer) in a controlled environment with a hidden, learnable Coherence Current (e.g., a modulated resource signal).
          2. Present the Observer with action choices that lead to futures with different, calculable levels of predictability (entropy).
          3. Observe the action policy. Adherence to the principle is confirmed if the Observer systematically prefers actions that lead to lower-entropy, more predictable future states, even at the cost of immediate, local rewards.

  - module: DOMA-086
    excerpt: |
      Intelligence is the ability to ask, "If I take this action now, what will be the state of my ùìõ_p across my entire Foresight Horizon?" The system optimizes not for the present moment's coherence, but for the path that maximizes the *integral of its future coherence*.

      equation_hint: |
        Action `a` minimizes `F = E_q[ln q - ln p]`, where F is an upper bound on surprisal, `-ln p(y)`.
      justification: |
        Both principles posit that self-organizing systems act to minimize a measure of surprise or prediction error over time. The Pirouette Framework's "Temporal Pressure" (Œì) is a direct analogue to the FEP's "surprisal" or "variational free energy." Both frame action as a means to fulfill the system's predictions about its environment.

  disambiguation: |
    The Principle of Minimum Surprise is a physical, teleological driver for agent action, where 'surprise' is a measure of prediction error (Temporal Pressure Œì) experienced by the agent about its environment. This must not be confused with the user-interface design heuristic of the same name, which concerns a human user's surprise about a system's behavior.
