  art: |
    The universe's unbreakable leash, slack and unnoticed between those in close embrace, but pulling with a relentless, constant force against any who try to stray.
  law: |
    The component of the effective potential `V_eff(r)` that grows linearly with distance `r`, resulting in a constant restoring force `F = -b` at large `r`. The energy required for separation `ΔE` is proportional to the separation distance `Δr` (`ΔE = b*Δr`), making infinite separation impossible for a finite energy expenditure.
  philosophy: |
    This term represents the principle that belonging is a physical law. The energy cost of breaking a coherent system is not an externally imposed barrier, but a consequence of the system's own resonance feeding back on itself, making separation from the whole an infinitely costly act.
pirouette_definition: |
  The linear term `b*r` in the effective potential `V_eff(r) = a/r + b*r`. It arises from the scale-dependent feedback of a system's resonant intensity into its local Temporal Pressure (Γ), becoming the dominant term at large distances. This term ensures that the force between constituent particles approaches a non-zero constant (`-b`), making the work required to separate them proportional to the distance and thus preventing escape (confinement).

          Measure the mass-squared `m²` and spin `J` for a family of related hadrons (e.g., mesons or baryons). Plot `J` versus `m²`. The slope of the resulting "Regge trajectory" is `α' = 1/(2πb)`. A linear trajectory provides strong evidence for a linear confining potential.

        pitfalls: [At large distances, the energy in the field can cause pair production ("string breaking"), which truncates the purely linear behavior., Observed hadrons are complex systems, not simple two-body problems, introducing secondary effects.]

  - module: MATH-006
    excerpt: |
      As the distance r grows large (r -> infinity), the force is lim(r->infinity) F(r) = -b. The force does not diminish with distance. It approaches a constant, non-zero value. To separate the particles by an infinite distance would require an infinite amount of work, which is impossible. This is confinement.

      justification: |
        The Cornell potential is a highly successful phenomenological model in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) for the potential between a quark and antiquark. Its linear term, `σr`, where `σ` is the QCD string tension, directly models confinement. The Pirouette term `b*r` is mathematically identical and serves the same conceptual role, with `b` mapping directly to `σ`.

  disambiguation: |
    In the context of the Gladiator Force potential `V_eff = a/r + b*r`, the symbol `b` exclusively refers to the coefficient of the linear term, representing the confinement strength or string tension. It is dimensionally a force.

# Confinement Term

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The linear term `b*r` in the effective potential `V_eff(r) = a/r + b*r`. It arises from the scale-dependent feedback of a system's resonant intensity into its local Temporal Pressure (Γ), becoming the dominant term at large distances. This term ensures that the force between constituent particles approaches a non-zero constant (`-b`), making the work required to separate them proportional to the distance and thus preventing escape (confinement).

## EFT-First Summary
The Confinement Term `b*r` is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the linear potential term `σr` in the Cornell potential of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This term models the energy stored in the gluon field (flux tube) between a quark-antiquark pair, leading to a constant attractive force at large distances and explaining why quarks are never observed in isolation (quark confinement). The coefficient `b` is directly equivalent to the QCD string tension `σ`, measured to be approximately 1 GeV/fm.
