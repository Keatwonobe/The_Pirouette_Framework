    The moment a frayed thread snaps under its own history's weight. It is the sudden, irreversible unraveling after a long, quiet decay, where a system forgets itself so completely it must either become something else or nothing at all.
  law: |
    A system undergoing Coherence Erosion will, upon its temporal coherence (KœÑ) falling below a critical threshold dictated by ambient temporal pressure (Œì), undergo a non-linear phase transition into either a new, lower-coherence basin of attraction (reconfiguration) or complete decoherence (dissolution).
  philosophy: |
    This concept bridges the insidious nature of gradual decay with the finality of catastrophic failure. It establishes that collapse is not always caused by an external shock, but is often the pre-written, final chapter of a story of slow, internal neglect and forgotten purpose.
pirouette_definition: |
  A critical, non-linear phase transition marking the terminal point of Coherence Erosion. It occurs when a system's degraded resonant pattern (Ki) and temporal coherence (KœÑ) can no longer withstand ambient temporal pressure (Œì), causing the system to either collapse into a new, simpler stable state (Reconfiguration) or lose all resonant form (Dissolution).

          Monitor a system exhibiting signatures of advanced Coherence Erosion (e.g., decaying KœÑ, high internal friction). Identify a discontinuity in the system's state evolution. Compare the pre- and post-event Ki patterns and Wound Channels to determine if the outcome was Reconfiguration (new stable pattern) or Dissolution (no pattern).

    excerpt: |
      A thread can only fray so much before it snaps. A drifting system does not degrade indefinitely; it approaches a critical phase transition, a point of **Coherence Cascade Failure**. This is the threshold where the system's degraded Ki pattern is no longer stable enough to resist the ambient Temporal Pressure. Its internal coherence can no longer hold itself together. At this point, the system faces one of two fates: Reconfiguration (Basin Shift) or Dissolution.

    excerpt: |
      The process of drift is a story told in the language of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`). Drift is the direct, observable consequence of this integral consistently and slowly decreasing. The primary cause is the decay of the kinetic term, `K_œÑ`... The system falls from its geodesic, its path no longer one ofmaximal coherence, but of slow, grinding decay into a basin of attraction characterized by chronic inefficiency.

      justification: |
        A Coherence Cascade Failure is a qualitative change in a system's behavior (collapse/reconfiguration) as a control parameter (degraded coherence KœÑ) crosses a critical threshold. This maps directly to bifurcation theory, where a small change in a parameter leads to a sudden topological change in the system's phase portrait, such as the disappearance of a stable fixed point.

# Coherence Cascade Failure

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A critical, non-linear phase transition marking the terminal point of Coherence Erosion. It occurs when a system's degraded resonant pattern (Ki) and temporal coherence (KœÑ) can no longer withstand ambient temporal pressure (Œì), causing the system to either collapse into a new, simpler stable state (Reconfiguration) or lose all resonant form (Dissolution).

## EFT-First Summary
A Coherence Cascade Failure is analogous to a critical phase transition or bifurcation in a dynamical system. When the system's primary kinetic term (temporal coherence, KœÑ) degrades below a threshold set by environmental noise, the system's potential landscape shifts, causing it to fall into a new, lower-energy (simpler) state or lose its structure entirely. This is conceptually similar to saddle-node bifurcations where stable fixed points disappear. (See Strogatz, *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos*).
