        The modernized view reveals a deeper, more elegant truth: the filter is not a separate guardian. The filter is the song itself. The universe possesses an intrinsic, self-regulating feedback mechanism that acts as a crucible, a systemic immune response that continuously tests the integrity of every pattern.

  art: |
    A system’s integrity is its shield. Coherence is its own legion, turning a clear note sung in a storm into an unbreachable wall against chaos.
  law: |
    A system's amplification of an external signal is proportional to the signal's coherence with the system's own Wound Channel. Dissonant signals are reflected or damped with an energy loss proportional to the degree of their incoherence. This response function, Φ_R, governs all interactions.
  philosophy: |
    This principle establishes that stability is not passive but an active, self-defending process. It reframes integrity not as a moral choice but as a physical advantage, making coherence the most effective strategy for persistence in a chaotic universe. Truth is its own guardian.
pirouette_definition: |
  The emergent, self-regulating process by which a coherent system, as a direct consequence of the Pirouette Lagrangian, selectively interacts with external patterns. The system's own resonance acts as an intrinsic filter that (1) amplifies harmonic signals by integrating them into its own structure, potentially leading to Alchemical Union; (2) reflects dissonant or mimicked signals that represent paths of high action; and (3) damps ambient noise (Temporal Pressure) by failing to grant it a foothold. This process manifests in three primary modes: the Mirror Filter (self-correction), the Crucible Filter (synthesis), and the Damping Filter (rejection).

        outline: |
          1. Characterize the resonant structure (primary Ki pattern) of a stable system's Wound Channel.
          2. Direct a sequence of calibrated, low-amplitude probe signals with varying degrees of coherence relative to the system's pattern.
          3. For each probe, measure the change in the target system's total coherence (ΔK_τ) and the energy/phase of the reflected signal.
          4. Plot ΔK_τ as a function of input coherence to map the Φ_R response curve.
        expected_signals: [A sharp peak in ΔK_τ at maximum coherence, increased reflected energy at high dissonance.]
        pitfalls: [Probe signal destabilizing the target system (observer effect), insufficient isolation from ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ), inaccurate initial characterization of the Wound Channel.]

      The modernized view reveals a deeper, more elegant truth: the filter is not a separate guardian. The filter is the song itself. The universe possesses an intrinsic, self-regulating feedback mechanism that acts as a crucible, a systemic immune response that continuously tests the integrity of every pattern. This process is not an external judgment but an emergent consequence of the universe's fundamental drive to maximize coherence, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

    excerpt: |
      We sought a cosmic judge and found a law of physics. We looked for guardians and found that truth is its own guardian. The universe does not punish falsehood or chaos; it simply fails to grant them resonance. Their signals are not amplified. They leave no lasting echo... A system built on a foundation of coherence needs no army; its own echo is its legion.

      justification: |
        A system's Wound Channel defines its natural frequency (ω_0). Incoming signals (driving force at frequency ω) that match ω_0 are amplified, while off-resonance signals are suppressed (damped). This provides a direct, well-understood physical analog for amplification of harmony and rejection of dissonance.

    Distinguish from engineered or artificial filters. Resonant Filtering is an intrinsic, emergent property of any coherent system, arising from its fundamental dynamics. The system *is* the filter; it is not a component *of* the system.

# Resonant Filtering

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The central process by which a system's resonance amplifies harmonic signals and reflects or damps dissonant ones.

## EFT-First Summary
Resonant Filtering can be modeled as the transfer function of a band-pass filter or a driven, damped harmonic oscillator. The system's intrinsic structure (its Wound Channel) defines a resonant frequency or pass-band. Incoming signals whose patterns fall within this band are amplified, while those outside it are attenuated. This mechanism effectively selects for information that is coherent with the system's existing state, providing a physical basis for stability and self-regulation.
