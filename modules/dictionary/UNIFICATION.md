    The early universe sets the tempo: Γ begins frozen, takes its first breath when H ~ m_Γ, and then beats like a hidden metronome. At late times, a tail in its potential slows the drum, whispering as dark energy. It is one score, played on a single instrument.
  law: |
    A single scalar field Γ, governed by a quadratic-plus-tail potential V(Γ), must simultaneously reproduce the phenomenology of cold dark matter via early-universe oscillations and dark energy via late-time slow-roll. All model parameters are irrevocably fixed by a single measurement anchor ("one-shot").
  philosophy: |
    To replace two independent mysteries—dark matter and dark energy—with a single, falsifiable physical mechanism. This addresses the cosmological coincidence problem dynamically and increases the framework's explanatory power by reducing the number of fundamental dark components to one.
pirouette_definition: |
  The principle that the Γ field, a single dynamical scalar, accounts for the universe's entire dark sector. Its early-time, high-frequency oscillations around a quadratic potential minimum generate an effective pressureless fluid (Cold Dark Matter). Its late-time, slow-roll evolution driven by a non-quadratic potential tail generates an effective negative-pressure fluid (Dark Energy). The transition between these two regimes is governed by the cosmic expansion rate H(z) relative to the field's mass m_Γ, providing a dynamical solution to the coincidence problem.

          1. Select a potential V(Γ) from the allowed class (e.g., quadratic + cosine tail).
          2. Use a "one-shot anchor" (e.g., Ω_{Γ,0}) to freeze all free parameters in a public Freeze Manifest.
          3. Evolve the unified Γ-fluid model from inflationary initial conditions to today using a Boltzmann code.
          4. Compare the model's locked-in predictions for BBN (ΔN_eff), CMB (power spectra), and LSS (fσ₈, S₈) against all relevant observational data simultaneously.

      The early universe sets the **tempo**: Γ begins frozen, takes its first breath when (H \sim m_\Gamma), and then beats like a hidden metronome that matter can’t hear—until the tail in (V(\Gamma)) slows the drum at late times, whispering as dark energy.

        The mechanism of early-universe misalignment oscillations sourcing a matter-like fluid is characteristic of axion-like particles (ALPs) or Fuzzy Dark Matter. The addition of a potential "tail" that enables late-time slow-roll acceleration makes it analogous to Quintessence. This model unifies both concepts.

# Unification

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The principle that the Γ field, a single dynamical scalar, accounts for the universe's entire dark sector. Its early-time, high-frequency oscillations around a quadratic potential minimum generate an effective pressureless fluid (Cold Dark Matter). Its late-time, slow-roll evolution driven by a non-quadratic potential tail generates an effective negative-pressure fluid (Dark Energy). The transition between these two regimes is governed by the cosmic expansion rate H(z) relative to the field's mass m_Γ, providing a dynamical solution to the coincidence problem.

## EFT-First Summary
This model proposes a unified dark sector based on a single scalar field, analogous to a "quintessential axion." Early-universe misalignment oscillations source a CDM-like fluid, while a non-periodic "tail" in the potential drives late-time acceleration, similar to quintessence. Its key feature is its falsifiability, demanding that a single set of Lagrangian parameters, fixed once, must fit all cosmological epochs from BBN to the present day.
