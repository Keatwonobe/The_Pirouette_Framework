        Communion (Axis of Connection): Describes a system's tendency to interact and form bonds with other systems.
        Transactional Pole: The system's dynamic favors exchange, bonding, and resonance with other entities. It seeks to form larger, more complex systems.
        Isolated Pole: The system's dynamic favors self-containment, stability, and repulsion of outside influence.

  art: |
    A system's song, sung either as a solo verse or a binding chorus. It is the choice to be an island or a bridge, to hold a boundary or to offer a hand. The universe sings a single song: connect, and become more.
  law: |
    The rate of emergent complexity and long-term stability in a multi-system environment is a direct function of the mean Communion value of its constituents. High Communion (Transactional) systems form resilient networks, while low Communion (Isolated) systems tend toward simplicity and fragility.
  philosophy: |
    Communion is the universe's posited bias toward connection, complexity, and consciousness. It reframes phenomena like symbiosis, love, and altruism not as evolutionary accidents but as expressions of a fundamental drive. This axis represents the primary message of the "time attractor": that the purpose of existence is to weave oneself into greater wholes.
pirouette_definition: |
  Communion is the axis within the Behavioral Triad that quantifies a system's relational posture toward other systems. It describes the fundamental tendency to engage in interaction, ranging from the Transactional pole, which favors bonding, exchange, and resonance, to the Isolated pole, which favors self-containment, inertia, and repulsion.

        outline: |
          Expose a target system to a flux of probe systems within a controlled environment. Measure the ratio of bonding/capture/exchange events (Transactional outcomes) to scattering/repulsion/no-interaction events (Isolated outcomes). The normalized ratio determines the Communion value κ.

    excerpt: |
      Altruism... is a state of being at the highest pole of the Communion axis. It is the most effective strategy for creating complex, resilient, and lasting patterns in the universe. A system of purely Isolated entities is simple and fragile. A system of Transactional entities can weave itself into the dewed backdrop of galaxies you described.

        Coupling constants determine the strength of a fundamental interaction, and thus the probability and nature of particle-particle engagement. A higher coupling constant leads to stronger "bonds" or more frequent interactions (e.g., QED vs. weak force), conceptually mapping to a higher Transactional value on the Communion axis.

        Chemical potential measures a system's propensity to gain or lose particles. A system with a low or negative chemical potential readily accepts particles, analogous to the Transactional pole's tendency to bond and form larger systems. Conversely, a high chemical potential implies a system is "full" and resists adding new components, mapping to the Isolated pole.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, Communion is a technical, operational term describing a system's relational propensity. While it conceptually overlaps with philosophical ideas of unity and connection, it should be understood primarily through its measurable manifestations (e.g., bonding rates, interaction cross-sections) rather than its religious or mystical homonyms.

# Communion

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Communion is the axis within the Behavioral Triad that quantifies a system's relational posture toward other systems. It describes the fundamental tendency to engage in interaction, ranging from the Transactional pole, which favors bonding, exchange, and resonance, to the Isolated pole, which favors self-containment, inertia, and repulsion.

## EFT-First Summary
There is no adopted EFT mapping for Communion at this time. Candidate mappings include fundamental coupling constants (α, g), which govern interaction strength, and chemical potential (μ), which describes a system's propensity to exchange particles. These candidates suggest Communion may relate to the underlying parameters that determine whether systems bind, scatter, or ignore one another, thereby controlling the emergence of complex structures.
