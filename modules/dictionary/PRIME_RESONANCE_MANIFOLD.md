  art: |
    A search for a single point of light revealed a constellation. The manifold is a surface of possibility upon which the universe can tie itself into different, equally valid knots of physical law.
  law: |
    The set of all parameter triplets (μ_ν, p, q) that cause the Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law to reproduce experimentally measured neutrino mass-squared differences (Δm²₂₁, Δm²₃₁) forms a continuous, two-dimensional surface in its three-dimensional parameter space. Any point on this surface represents a physically valid neutrino sector.
  philosophy: |
    The existence of the manifold reframes fundamental constants not as rigid, universal numbers, but as parameters in a geometric relationship that allows for a "suppleness" in physical law. It posits a previously unseen degree of freedom, suggesting the universe is not built on a single foundation but woven from a fabric that permits infinite valid configurations.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Prime Resonance Manifold is the continuous, two-dimensional surface embedded in the three-dimensional parameter space of the Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law. Every point on this surface corresponds to a unique triplet of parameters—Base Mass Scale (μ_ν), Participation Exponent (p), and Purity Exponent (q)—that perfectly reproduces the experimentally observed neutrino mass-squared differences. Its existence implies that a spectrum of valid physical realities can exist, rather than a single set of fundamental constants.

        outline: |
          1.  Input the latest global fit values for neutrino oscillation parameters (mixing angles θ₁₂, θ₁₃, θ₂₃, δ and mass splittings Δm²₂₁, Δm²₃₁).
          2.  Define the Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law equations: $m_i = f(\mu_\nu, p, q, U)$.
          3.  Numerically solve for the locus of all points (μ_ν, p, q) that satisfy the two mass-squared difference constraints simultaneously.
          4.  Plot the resulting set of solution points in 3D space.
          5.  Perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the point cloud to confirm its dimensionality.
        expected_signals:
          - A dense point cloud forming a thin, continuous, slightly curved 2D "sheet" in the 3D (μ_ν, p, q) parameter space.
          - PCA results showing two principal components accounting for '>>98%' of the data's variance.
        pitfalls:
          - Insufficient precision in input oscillation data leads to a "thick," poorly-defined surface instead of a sharp manifold.
          - Numerical solver artifacts or sparse sampling may create the illusion of holes or discontinuities.
          - Mis-modeling of matter effects (Γ parameter) could systematically distort the inferred shape of the manifold.

    excerpt: |
      The investigation into neutrino mass and oscillation within the Pirouette Framework began as a search for a single, precise set of fundamental constants... it led to a far more profound discovery: the constants are not fixed. Instead, they exist as a continuous surface of valid solutions—a "prime resonance manifold."

    excerpt: |
      Using the Manifold Explorer tool, the shape of this solution space was mapped. The analysis confirmed the Knot Hypothesis, revealing a thin, slightly curved "sheet" of solutions. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the manifold showed that two principal axes accounted for over 98% of the data's variance, confirming its two-dimensional nature.

        Both are continuous spaces of parameters where each point defines a self-consistent physical theory or vacuum state. The Prime Resonance Manifold parameterizes a family of valid neutrino physics models, just as a moduli space parameterizes a family of valid physical vacua, representing a continuous degeneracy or "flat direction" in the fundamental theory.

# Prime Resonance Manifold

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Prime Resonance Manifold is the continuous, two-dimensional surface embedded in the three-dimensional parameter space of the Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law. Every point on this surface corresponds to a unique triplet of parameters—Base Mass Scale (μ_ν), Participation Exponent (p), and Purity Exponent (q)—that perfectly reproduces the experimentally observed neutrino mass-squared differences. Its existence implies that a spectrum of valid physical realities can exist, rather than a single set of fundamental constants.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to a moduli space in effective field theory, the Prime Resonance Manifold is a 2D surface in a 3D parameter space where each point represents a valid, self-consistent set of parameters for the neutrino sector. This implies a continuous degeneracy in the fundamental theory, rather than a single, fixed vacuum state. Neutrinos in different physical environments may correspond to different points ("knots") on this manifold.
