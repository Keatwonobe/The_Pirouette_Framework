    At low energies, the deep hum of the temporal medium fades to silence, leaving only the clean, sharp lines of light and charge. The universe forgets its underlying rhythm and performs the familiar music of quantum electrodynamics.
  law: |
    For any energy scale μ far below the coherence barrier ω_c, the contributions of Γ-field dynamics to any QED observable are suppressed by powers of (μ/ω_c)². The low-energy effective field theory is standard QED.
  philosophy: |
    Γ-decoupling is the core principle ensuring the Pirouette Framework's empirical validity. It mandates that new physics emerges only at high energies, preserving the vast, precise, and verified successes of QED without requiring fine-tuning or introducing low-energy contradictions.

  The mechanism by which the dynamical effects of the temporal pressure field (Γ) become negligible at energy scales (μ) significantly below the coherence barrier (ω_c). In this infrared (IR) limit, Γ fluctuations behave as heavy, unresolvable degrees of freedom, and the resulting effective field theory for electromagnetism is identical to standard QED, reproducing all its tested predictions.

          Perform high-precision measurements of canonical QED observables (e.g., electron anomalous magnetic moment g-2, Lamb shift, running of α). Compare results to Standard Model QED predictions. The confirmation of Γ-decoupling is the *absence* of any statistically significant deviation attributable to new physics.

    This term refers specifically to the decoupling of the Γ-field's dynamics in the infrared limit of the Pirouette Framework, rendering the low-energy theory as standard QED. It is an application of the EFT decoupling theorem, not a cosmological event.

# Γ-decoupling

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The mechanism by which the dynamical effects of the temporal pressure field (Γ) become negligible at energy scales (μ) significantly below the coherence barrier (ω_c). In this infrared (IR) limit, Γ fluctuations behave as heavy, unresolvable degrees of freedom, and the resulting effective field theory for electromagnetism is identical to standard QED, reproducing all its tested predictions.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of effective field theory (EFT), Γ-decoupling is an instance of the Appelquist–Carazzone decoupling theorem. The Γ-field's quantum fluctuations have an effective mass scale set by the coherence barrier, M_coh ~ ħω_c/c². At experimental energies E ≪ M_coh, these heavy degrees of freedom can be "integrated out." This process leaves standard QED as the correct low-energy EFT, with all new physics appearing in higher-dimension operators suppressed by powers of (E/M_coh)².
