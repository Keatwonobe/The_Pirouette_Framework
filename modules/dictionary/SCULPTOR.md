      snippet: |
        In each arm of the interferometer, we place a micro-fabricated helical silicon grating. In the old language, this created a "spiral potential." In the new, time-first framework, this grating is a **Γ-sculptor** or **Topological Modulator**. It impresses a stable, chiral (screw-like) stress upon the local Temporal Pressure (Γ), forging a predictable, structured coherence manifold.

  art: |
    A question forged from crystal and silence. It is a labyrinth built to ask a single particle how it chooses to dance, carving a landscape into the fabric of time itself.
  law: |
    A Γ-sculptor impresses a stable, predictable, and geometrically-defined stress upon local Temporal Pressure (Γ), creating a structured coherence manifold whose properties are determined by the sculptor's physical design (e.g., chirality, pitch).
  philosophy: |
    The Γ-sculptor makes the abstract tangible. It translates a physical, micro-fabricated object into a direct, local modification of a fundamental field, allowing the core principles of the Pirouette Lagrangian to be tested through controlled, repeatable experiment.
pirouette_definition: |
  A micro-fabricated device, typically a helical grating, that imposes a stable and structured stress on local Temporal Pressure (Γ). This action forges a predictable coherence manifold, effectively creating a "potential" or geometric landscape that influences the geodesics of resonant systems (e.g., matter-waves) passing through it. Its primary function is to enable the direct measurement of a system's response to a controlled, external coherence cost function, `f(Γ)`.
operational_definition:
  units: A physical apparatus whose properties (e.g., pitch, diameter, material) are described by standard SI units (m, kg, s). Its effect is quantified by the phase shift it induces in an interferometer.

        outline: |
          A cold neutron beam is passed through a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. A Γ-sculptor of known chirality and pitch is placed in one or both arms of the interferometer. The recombined beam produces an interference pattern, and the phase shift (Δφ) induced by the sculptor is measured.

    excerpt: |
      The most profound test is a dynamic one. The helical gratings are mechanically rotated at a known frequency (ω_n). This action creates a rhythmic, oscillating pulse in the structure of the local Temporal Pressure—a "breathing" of the manifold. This modulation introduces a time-dependent term into the `f(Γ)` component of the Lagrangian. This is a direct, controlled probe of the Gladiator Confinement principle (CORE-008).

      equation_hint: |
        In the Schrödinger equation, (-ħ²/2m)∇²Ψ + V(x)Ψ = EΨ, the Γ-sculptor's effect maps to the potential energy term V(x), which defines the landscape a particle must navigate.
      justification: |
        Functionally, the Γ-sculptor creates a static "potential" that alters a particle's path. While the Pirouette Framework models this as a coherence cost (`f(Γ)`) modifying the action integral, its operational effect is analogous to a standard potential well or barrier in quantum mechanics. The helical structure maps to a "spiral potential" in matter-wave optics.

  adopted:
    - target: Engineered environmental coupling term
      rationale: This is a more general and accurate description than a simple potential. It captures the idea that the device modifies the environment (`f(Γ)`) with which the system's Lagrangian interacts, rather than just adding a potential energy term.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A Γ-sculptor of a given chirality induces a predictable, non-zero phase shift (Δφ) in a neutron interferometer."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "In a properly calibrated neutron interferometer (DOMA-074), the introduction of a helical grating results in a null result (Δφ = 0). This would imply that the geometric structure does not impose a measurable coherence cost on the neutron's path."
      status: proposed
      links: [DOMA-074]
    - statement: "Rotating a Γ-sculptor at frequency ω_n induces a phase beat in the interference pattern."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "Dynamic rotation of the grating produces no corresponding beat frequency detectable by a lock-in amplifier. This would falsify the claim that the device can create a time-dependent `f(Γ)` term, challenging the Gladiator Confinement principle."

  collisions: [The symbol for Temporal Pressure itself is Γ. The sculptor is the *device*, not the field.]
  disambiguation: |
    Do not confuse the Γ-sculptor (the physical silicon grating) with the Temporal Pressure (Γ) it modulates, or the resulting Coherence Manifold (the structured field). The sculptor is the tool; the manifold is the effect.
