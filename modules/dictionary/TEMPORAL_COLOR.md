        * **SU(3):** local **temporal-color** basis of three degenerate shear modes.
  editors: [GPT-4]
  review_log: []
triad:
  art: |
    Three resonant modes of the temporal medium shear against each other in perfect degeneracy. The freedom to choose which mode is 'red', 'green', or 'blue' at each point in spacetime is the origin of color charge. A gluon is the price paid for changing that local convention.
  law: |
    The local relabeling freedom of the three degenerate temporal-color shear modes generates the SU(3) gauge group. The energy cost to deform this local basis frame across spacetime is precisely the Yang–Mills Lagrangian for gluons.
  philosophy: |
    Temporal-color provides a physical, mechanistic origin for the abstract SU(3) symmetry of the Standard Model. It grounds gauge theory in the material property of 'frame stiffness', recasting an axiom of particle physics as an emergent property of the Pirouette medium's internal dynamics.
pirouette_definition: |
  A basis of three degenerate temporal shear modes whose local relabeling freedom constitutes the SU(3) gauge symmetry of color charge. At each spacetime point, a frame can be chosen for this three-dimensional subspace. Promoting this freedom to a local symmetry requires a connection, the gluon field (A_\mu^a), which synchronizes the frame choice between points. The medium's physical stiffness against variations in this frame generates the Yang–Mills energy term, with the coupling constant g_s parameterizing the stiffness.

      - name: Infer via Gluon Self-Interaction
        outline: |
          The non-Abelian nature of the temporal-color frame implies that its connection field (gluons) must self-interact. This is measured by analyzing scattering processes with 3-gluon or 4-gluon vertices, such as four-jet production in hadron colliders. The angular distributions and cross-sections of these events are compared to predictions from SU(3) gauge theory.
        expected_signals:
          - Non-zero three-gluon and four-gluon vertex factors in scattering amplitudes.
          - Jet event shapes and rates consistent with the SU(3) color factors (C_A = 3, C_F = 4/3).
        pitfalls:
          - High QCD background can obscure the signal.
          - Higher-order perturbative corrections or non-perturbative effects can mimic deviations from pure SU(3) structure.

        Temporal-color is the proposed physical origin of the Standard Model's abstract SU(3) color symmetry. The mathematical structure is identical, but Pirouette provides a generative mechanism: the degeneracy of modes in the temporal medium. This maps the abstract concept of color charge to a concrete degree of freedom.

    In the Standard Model, "color" is an abstract, fundamental charge. In Pirouette, "Temporal-color" refers to the specific, physical, degenerate basis of shear modes within the temporal medium. The abstract SM "color" is the emergent relabeling symmetry *of* this physical basis.

# Temporal-color

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A basis of three degenerate temporal shear modes whose local relabeling freedom constitutes the SU(3) gauge symmetry of color charge. At each spacetime point, a frame can be chosen for this three-dimensional subspace. Promoting this freedom to a local symmetry requires a connection, the gluon field (A_\mu^a), which synchronizes the frame choice between points. The medium's physical stiffness against variations in this frame generates the Yang–Mills energy term, with the coupling constant g_s parameterizing the stiffness.

## EFT-First Summary
Temporal-color provides a physical origin for the SU(3) color symmetry of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In this model, the abstract basis of color charge is identified with a concrete, degenerate three-dimensional basis of shear modes in the temporal medium. The freedom to locally re-orient this basis gives rise to the SU(3) gauge symmetry. The gluon field emerges as the connection that maintains coherence of this basis, and the Yang-Mills Lagrangian is the energy cost associated with the "stiffness" of this basis against spacetime deformations. This mechanism directly predicts the non-Abelian self-interaction of gluons as a consequence of the geometric curvature of the internal frame space.
