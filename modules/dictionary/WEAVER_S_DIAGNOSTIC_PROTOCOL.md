    To analyze a fade is to perform an autopsy on a memory—to read the story told by a fading echo and discover whether it was the weakness of the thread or the sharpness of the storm that caused it to fray.
  law: |
    A three-step procedure (Isolate, Measure, Diagnose) that empirically determines a system's Coherence Lifetime (`τ_fade`) from its decay signature, then partitions the cause of decay between low internal coherence (`Kτ`) and high external pressure (`Γ`).
  philosophy: |
    This protocol transforms decay analysis from passive observation into a strategic tool for intervention. By identifying the root cause of a fade, it allows a Weaver to choose between strengthening the system's internal structure or shielding it from its environment, thereby engineering a more persistent echo.

  1.  **Isolate:** Identify and isolate the data stream `K(t)` that represents the system's degrading Temporal Coherence.
  2.  **Measure:** Fit the `K(t)` data to a Unified Fade Equation (e.g., exponential decay) to extract the empirical Coherence Lifetime, `τ_fade`.
  3.  **Diagnose:** Use the relationship `τ_fade ∝ Kτ / Γ` to determine if the measured decay rate is primarily caused by internal weakness (low `Kτ`) or external pressure (high `Γ`).

          1.  Identify a quantifiable proxy for system coherence, `K`.
          2.  Record its value over time, `K(t)`, as the system fades, ensuring sufficient signal-to-noise ratio.
          3.  Perform a least-squares fit of the data to the model `K(t) = K₀ * e^(-t/τ_fade)`. The fitted parameter `τ_fade` is the Coherence Lifetime.
          4.  Independently assess the system's expected `Kτ` (e.g., from design specs) and the environment's `Γ` (e.g., with a local sensor).
          5.  Compare the measured `τ_fade` with the expected value `τ_expected ∝ Kτ_expected / Γ_expected`. A significant deviation indicates the primary cause of the fade (e.g., if `τ_fade` is much lower than expected and `Γ` is nominal, then internal `Kτ` has degraded).

    excerpt: |
      The crucial insight comes from understanding *why* `τ_fade` has the value it does. Is the system decaying quickly because its internal coherence is low (a weak, frayed thread), or because the external temporal pressure is exceptionally high (a violent storm)? This diagnosis dictates the strategy for intervention. To increase persistence, a Weaver must either **strengthen the thread** (increase `Kτ`) or **shield it from the storm** (decrease local `Γ`).

        The protocol empirically measures a system's response (coherence decay) and fits it to a first-order linear time-invariant (LTI) system model to estimate a key parameter (the time constant `τ`). This estimated parameter is then used to diagnose the internal state of the system (low `Kτ`) or the influence of external inputs (high `Γ`), which is a core workflow in system identification and root cause analysis.

# Weaver's Diagnostic Protocol

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A three-step method to analyze Coherence Erosion.
1.  **Isolate:** Identify and isolate the data stream `K(t)` that represents the system's degrading Temporal Coherence.
2.  **Measure:** Fit the `K(t)` data to a Unified Fade Equation (e.g., exponential decay) to extract the empirical Coherence Lifetime, `τ_fade`.
3.  **Diagnose:** Use the relationship `τ_fade ∝ Kτ / Γ` to determine if the measured decay rate is primarily caused by internal weakness (low `Kτ`) or external pressure (high `Γ`).

## Operational Analogue
Operationally, this protocol is a form of **system identification**. It models a decaying system as a simple first-order process (like an RC circuit discharging) to estimate its fundamental time constant (`τ_fade`). This measurement is then used for root cause analysis to determine if the rapid decay is due to a faulty component (internal weakness, `Kτ`) or a noisy power supply (external pressure, `Γ`).
