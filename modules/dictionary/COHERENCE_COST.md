        The rate of local entropy production (`Ṡ_local`) is directly proportional to the ambient Temporal Pressure and the degree of the system's own internal turbulence.

  art: |
    The universe does not punish inefficiency with a toxin; it presents a simple, unyielding bill. This debt is paid into the environment as an increase in its temporal noise, making coherence more difficult for all who follow.
  law: |
    The rate of local entropy production, `Ṡ_local`, is the measurable price of a system's deviation from its path of maximal coherence. It is directly proportional to the product of local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) and the system's internal Turbulence Index (`T_idx`).
  philosophy: |
    Coherence Cost is not merely a diagnostic tool for waste; it is a moral compass for stewardship. It quantifies the entropic footprint of an action, measuring not only what a system has done, but the ghost of what it could have been.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence Cost (`Ṡ_local`) is the rate of entropic waste generated when a system deviates from its geodesic of maximal coherence and enters a state of turbulent flow. It is the quantifiable friction—the conversion of potential coherence into dissonant noise—that results from inefficient information processing and action. This cost accumulates over time in the system's Entropy Ledger (`S_ledger`) as a measure of its total temporal debt.

        outline: |
          Using a Coherence Auditor Kit (CAK), a Temporal Signature Array simultaneously measures the ambient environmental spectrum (to determine Γ) and the system's resonant Ki pattern. The Coherence Engine computes `T_idx` by comparing the Ki pattern to a calibrated ideal laminar flow template for that system class. `Ṡ_local` is then calculated via `Ṡ_local ∝ Γ ⋅ T_idx`.

    excerpt: |
      This module refactors the legacy concept of "Dark Residue" from a metaphysical substance into a rigorously defined, time-first principle: the **Coherence Cost**. This cost is not a substance, but a measure of **entropic waste**—the quantifiable friction and noise generated when a system operates in a state of turbulent, inefficient flow. By applying the principles of Flow Dynamics and the framework's understanding of information, this module establishes the **Entropy Ledger**, a formal instrumentation protocol for auditing this cost.
  - module: DOMA-068
    excerpt: |
      **Turbulent Flow**, by definition, is a deviation from this geodesic. The system is failing to maximize its coherence (`S_actual < S_ideal`). The Coherence Cost, `Ṡ_local`, is the direct, measurable price of that failure. The ledger, therefore, is not just a record of waste; it is a log of a system's deviation from the universe's most fundamental law, proportional to the action squandered on inelegant motion.

        Coherence Cost is defined as the rate of local entropy production due to irreversible processes (friction, turbulence), directly analogous to the entropy production rate in thermodynamics, which is always non-negative and represents dissipated energy or lost work. The `Γ ⋅ T_idx` form is a simplified model analogous to a product of thermodynamic flux and force.

    Distinguish from the *total entropy* of a system (`S`), which is a state function. Coherence Cost (`Ṡ_local`) is a rate of *production* due to process inefficiency, not a measure of total stored disorder. Also distinguish from the `ENTROPY_LEDGER` (`S_ledger`), which is the time-integral of `Ṡ_local`.

# Coherence Cost

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Coherence Cost (`Ṡ_local`) is the rate of entropic waste generated when a system deviates from its geodesic of maximal coherence and enters a state of turbulent flow. It is the quantifiable friction—the conversion of potential coherence into dissonant noise—that results from inefficient information processing and action. This cost accumulates over time in the system's Entropy Ledger (`S_ledger`) as a measure of its total temporal debt.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Cost is the Pirouette Framework's operational analogue to the **entropy production rate** (σ) in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It quantifies the rate at which useful energy is dissipated into heat and noise due to irreversible processes, which the framework models as `turbulence`. Whereas thermodynamic models use generalized fluxes and forces, Pirouette models this dissipation with the phenomenological expression `Ṡ_local ∝ Γ ⋅ T_idx`, where `Γ` is the ambient drive (Temporal Pressure) and `T_idx` is the system's internal degree of chaos. This provides a direct, instrument-based method for measuring the real-time inefficiency of any system.
