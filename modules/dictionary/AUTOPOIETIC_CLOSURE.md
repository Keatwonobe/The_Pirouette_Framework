    The universe writes its own laws. The texture of the smallest, fastest vibrations sets the scale of the largest, slowest dance of galaxies, closing the circle of causation.
  law: |
    The effective gravitational constant \(G_{\rm eff}\) and cosmological constant \(\Lambda_{\rm Pirouette}\) are not independent free parameters, but are fixed by the microscopic coherence barrier \(\omega_c\) via the relation \(G_{\rm eff}^{-1} \propto \omega_c^2 / \Lambda_{\rm Pirouette}\).
  philosophy: |
    This axiom enforces self-consistency and eliminates arbitrary tuning. It posits that a physically real system must determine its macroscopic properties from its microscopic constitution, making the universe's large-scale structure a direct consequence of the temporal medium's fundamental properties.

          1. Measure \(G_{\rm eff}\) using local gravitational experiments (e.g., torsion balance, lunar ranging).

          3. Constrain or measure \(\omega_c\) by searching for its predicted secondary effects, such as minute, frequency-dependent dispersion in gravitational waves from high-redshift sources.
          4. Verify that the measured values satisfy the closure relation \(8\pi G_{\rm eff} \Lambda_{\rm Pirouette} \sim \omega_c^{-2}\).

        In physics, a bootstrap is a method for constraining or solving a theory by imposing self-consistency conditions, often relating high-energy (UV) and low-energy (IR) behavior. Autopoietic Closure is a specific bootstrap condition that fixes the IR parameters of gravity using the UV cutoff scale.

        In some quantum gravity and noncommutative field theories, UV and IR scales are not independent. Autopoietic Closure is a concrete realization of this principle, providing a fixed formula that connects the ultimate UV cutoff (\(\omega_c\)) to deep IR parameters like \(\Lambda\).

    The term is a deliberate import from theoretical biology, where it means a system capable of creating and maintaining itself. Here it is used metaphorically: the universe's physical laws are self-creating and self-maintaining through this closure condition, rather than being externally imposed. It does not imply life or consciousness.

# Autopoietic Closure

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Autopoietic Closure is the sixth Substrate Rule (SR-6), an axiom stating that the macroscopic constants of the effective gravitational theory (\(G_{\rm eff}\), \(\Lambda_{\rm Pirouette}\)) are not fundamental inputs but are emergent quantities determined by the microscopic properties of the temporal medium, specifically the coherence barrier (\(\omega_c\)) and substrate stiffness ratios. This creates a non-arbitrary, self-consistent link between the UV and IR scales of the framework.

## EFT-First Summary
Autopoietic Closure functions as a **Bootstrap Condition** for the Pirouette Framework. It imposes a self-consistency relation between the theory's UV cutoff (the coherence barrier, \(\omega_c\)) and its emergent IR parameters—the gravitational constant \(G_{\rm eff}\) and cosmological constant \(\Lambda_{\rm Pirouette}\). This prevents fine-tuning by positing that the laws of gravity are not free parameters but are instead fixed by the underlying physics of the substrate, analogous to how macroscopic material properties like elasticity are determined by microscopic atomic bonds.
