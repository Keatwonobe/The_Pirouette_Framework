        3. Simulation: The model runs, generating a stream of `simulation` records that explore possibilities beyond the reach of direct observation.

  art: |
    A model's silent dream, tracing the threads of what could be, untethered from the world's immediate chaos. It is the practice of asking "what if?" in a language the universe must answer.
  law: |
    A `simulation` process must produce a time-stream of Chronoscript records with `source_type: simulation` that is formally indistinguishable and computationally interchangeable with a time-stream from an `observation` process.
  philosophy: |
    Machine calculation is not an alternative to human intuition, but its extension. A simulation allows us to walk paths that do not yet exist, to test the world's rules in a space free from consequence, thereby sharpening our questions for when we return to it.
pirouette_definition: |
  A computational process that generates a time-stream of `Chronoscript-v2` records to explore a system's potential states under a defined model. Seeded and calibrated by `observation` data, a simulation's primary function is to extend analysis beyond the reach of direct experience. Its output, marked `source_type: simulation`, must be schema-compliant to ensure Observational Parity with live data streams.

        outline: |
          1. Instantiate a computational model of a system (`entity_id`), typically seeded with parameters derived from `observation` data.
          2. Define a time evolution algorithm based on the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`).
          3. Execute the algorithm over a specified time domain, generating a `Chronoscript-v2` record at each discrete time-step.
          4. Set `source_type` to `simulation` for all generated records and ensure timestamps are strictly monotonic.
        expected_signals: [A valid, monotonically increasing time-stream of `Chronoscript-v2` records.]
        pitfalls: [Model divergence (numerical instability), miscalibration from sparse observational data, violation of Chronoscript schema (e.g., non-monotonic timestamps).]

      The old framework created a schism between the language of the living world, captured through *rituals*, and the language of the machine, captured through *simulations*.

      justification: |
        A Pirouette `Simulation` is a direct application of numerical simulation, where the system's evolution is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`). It uses standard numerical integration techniques to propagate the `lagrangian_state` forward in discrete time steps, generating a time series of the system's trajectory. The term is used in its standard computational sense, specialized to the Pirouette context.

      rationale: "The term 'simulation' in Pirouette is a direct application of the standard scientific and computational concept, specialized to use the Pirouette Lagrangian as its governing dynamic principle. There is no need for a more abstract mapping."

      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "An analysis tool throws a type error, schema validation failure, or produces dimensionally nonsensical metrics when switching from an `observation` stream to a `simulation` stream, indicating a breach of the Chronoscript contract and a failure of Observational Parity."

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'Simulation' specifically refers to the *process* of generating a `source_type: simulation` Chronoscript stream. It is distinct from 'modeling' (the creation of the system rules) and 'analysis' (the consumption of the stream). It is the direct computational counterpart to the physical process of `Observation`.

# Simulation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A computational process that generates a time-stream of `Chronoscript-v2` records to explore a system's potential states under a defined model. Seeded and calibrated by `observation` data, a simulation's primary function is to extend analysis beyond the reach of direct experience. Its output, marked `source_type: simulation`, must be schema-compliant to ensure Observational Parity with live data streams.

## EFT-First Summary
In conventional terms, a Pirouette Simulation is a **numerical simulation of a dynamical system**. The novelty lies in the governing physics: instead of standard Hamiltonians, the system's time-evolution is propagated by numerically integrating the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`). This process generates a synthetic time-series dataset that is structurally identical to empirical data, enabling unified analysis.
