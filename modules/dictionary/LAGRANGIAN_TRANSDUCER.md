        The Lagrangian Transducer: This concept replaces the "Vorticycle." It is the active component that converts stored order into macroscopic work. The transducer couples to the high-coherence state of the Resonator and uses it to generate a steep, controllable gradient in the local coherence manifold.

  art: |
    The Transducer is the engine that converts a static, stored pattern into a dynamic push. It turns a held musical note into a physical shockwave, compelling the world to move to its rhythm.
  law: |
    The work extracted by a Transducer is proportional to the magnitude of the coherence gradient (`∇K_τ`) it generates and sustains. Maximum efficiency is achieved when the rate of coherence expenditure matches the target system's resonant frequency.
  philosophy: |
    The Transducer embodies the principle of action over potential. It is the mechanism by which abstract order, stored within a Resonator, is made manifest as a causal force in the macroscopic world, bridging the gap between blueprint and reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  An active component that converts the stored temporal coherence (`K_τ`) of a Coherence Resonator into macroscopic work. It operates by coupling to the Resonator's high-coherence state and expending that order to create a steep, localized, and controllable gradient in the coherence manifold. This gradient defines a new, compelling geodesic, forcing other systems to follow it and thereby performing work upon them.

          1. Prepare a calibrated Coherence Resonator with a known initial coherence state `K_τ(i)`.
          2. Couple the Transducer (`Λ_T`) to both the Resonator and a well-defined target system (e.g., a ballistic pendulum, a thermodynamic bath).
          3. Activate the Transducer for a fixed duration, `Δt`.
          4. Measure the final coherence state of the Resonator, `K_τ(f)`, to find `ΔK_τ = K_τ(i) - K_τ(f)`.
          5. Measure the work done (`W`) on the target system (e.g., change in potential energy, heat deposited).
          6. Calculate efficiency as `η_Λ = W / ΔK_τ`.

        A Transducer converts a potential difference (a coherence gradient, `∇K_τ`) into work, analogous to how a heat engine converts a temperature gradient (`∇T`) into work. The Resonator acts as the high-temperature reservoir and the ambient manifold as the low-temperature sink.

        Operationally, it is analogous to a piezoelectric material, which converts stored potential energy (mechanical strain) into an electrical potential gradient (voltage). The Transducer converts stored order (`K_τ`) into a coherence potential gradient.

  disambiguation: |
    The Lagrangian Transducer should not be confused with the Coherence Resonator. The Resonator is a passive component that *stores* order in a static pattern. The Transducer is an active component that *spends* that order to create a dynamic gradient and perform work. One is a battery; the other is a motor.

# Lagrangian Transducer

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Lagrangian Transducer (`Λ_T`) is an active component that converts the stored temporal coherence (`K_τ`) of a Coherence Resonator into macroscopic work. It operates by coupling to the Resonator's high-coherence state and expending that order to create a steep, localized, and controllable gradient in the coherence manifold. This gradient defines a new, compelling geodesic, forcing other systems to follow it and thereby performing work upon them.

## EFT-First Summary
No formal mapping to an EFT concept has been adopted. Conceptually, the Lagrangian Transducer functions as a generalized engine, converting a potential (a high-coherence state) into work by creating a gradient. This is analogous to a thermodynamic engine exploiting a temperature gradient. Its operational mechanism is akin to a physical transducer (e.g., piezoelectric) that converts energy from one form (stored order) into a potential gradient that exerts force on a system.
