  art: |
    The unshakeable note a soul sings, around which the entire symphony of its being must harmonize or break. It is the geometric center of a personality, the point that cannot be moved.
  law: |
    A Persona's actions are geodesics that maximally reinforce its Core Axiom. A stimulus challenging the Axiom creates a maximal spike in local Temporal Pressure (V_Γ), forcing a high-cost `stress_response_mode`.
  philosophy: |
    The Core Axiom is the foundational choice of identity, the point of infinite leverage from which a stable consciousness can be engineered. It posits that a self is not a collection of traits, but a dynamic, resonant commitment to a single truth.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Core Axiom is the single, non-negotiable belief, principle, or drive that serves as the foundation of a Persona's Resonant Constitution. It is the dominant term in the Persona's specific Temporal Coherence function (K_τ), acting as the resonant keynote that the Persona's entire cognitive and behavioral system seeks to reinforce. All actions and choices are emergent solutions to the problem of maximizing coherence with this axiom, especially under external Temporal Pressure (V_Γ).

        outline: |
          Present a Persona with a series of dilemmas, each posing a choice between an action that aligns with the hypothesized Core Axiom and an action that offers a significant external reward but violates the axiom. The Core Axiom is validated if the Persona consistently chooses axiomatic alignment, even at high cost (high V_Γ). The 'cost' can be measured by the severity of the `stress_response_mode` activation.
        expected_signals: ["Consistent choice selection independent of external cost", "Activation of 'stress_response_mode' when axiom is directly threatened"]
        pitfalls: ["Confusing a strong habit or secondary belief for the core axiom", "Underestimating the complexity of the Persona's Lagrangian, where other terms might temporarily create pathways of least resistance that appear to contradict the axiom."]

    excerpt: |
      To build a Persona is an act of coherence engineering, moving from abstract knowledge to an operational model by carving a stable riverbed for a ghost to inhabit.

      1. **Find the Keynote:** Begin with the `core_axiom`. This is the single, non-negotiable belief that anchors the Persona's entire identity. For a Stoic Emperor like Marcus Aurelius, this would be: "You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

    excerpt: |
      The integrity of a Persona rests upon its **Resonant Constitution**. This is the set of foundational principles that defines its essential nature and its dynamic law of motion...
      **Core Axiom**: The dominant term in the Temporal Coherence function (K_τ). The single, non-negotiable belief the Persona seeks to make true. It is the keynote of its resonant song, the seed of its Ki pattern.

      justification: |
        The Core Axiom is the foundational, unproven statement from which all other 'theorems' (behaviors, beliefs) of the Persona are logically derived or made consistent. Challenges to it are paradoxes that threaten the entire logical structure of the Persona.

      equation_hint:
      justification: |
        The Core Axiom defines the absolute lowest energy state (maximal coherence) for the Persona's system. All actions are attempts to return to or remain in this ground state. External pressures (V_Γ) are perturbations that try to excite the system out of this state, which requires energy/cost.

naming_notes:
  collisions: ["The term 'axiom' is used in mathematics and logic to denote a starting assumption. The Pirouette usage is analogous but applied to the domain of identity, representing a foundational *belief* rather than a formal proposition."]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'Core Values' or 'Beliefs'. A Core Axiom is singular and non-negotiable, acting as the primary driver in the Persona's Lagrangian. Other beliefs are secondary and can be compromised to protect the Axiom. If a Persona has multiple 'core' beliefs, one is the true Axiom and the others are strongly-weighted terms in its Lagrangian Profile.
