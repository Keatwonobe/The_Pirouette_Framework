    A conductor brings water, prints the score, and dims the harsh lights. The room tunes itself because the singers are invited to sing, not forced to resonate. The song is almost as perfect—and everyone stays for an encore.
  law: |
    System coherence (\(T_a\)) may only be increased through environmental shaping actions (\(\mathcal A\)) that are explicitly disclosed and consented to by all participants. All influence must be auditable via Shadow Gauge (\(V_{\text{obs}}\)) and Dark Residue (\(\mathcal D\)) ledgers, with symmetric controls available to participants.
  philosophy: |
    To enable voluntary, collaborative alignment without coercion. It establishes that autonomy and transparency are preconditions for, not obstacles to, sustainable system coherence, reframing alignment from a control problem to a facilitation problem.
pirouette_definition: |
  The guiding normative principle of the Coherent Adherence Protocol v2 (CAP v2), which mandates that any action (\(\mathcal A\)) intended to increase a system's empirical coherence (\(T_a\)) must be implemented only with the explicit, informed, and retractable consent of all affected participants. It enforces this through hard constraints requiring transparency (\(\mathcal C_{\mathrm{transparency}}\)), auditable costs (\(V_{\text{obs}}\), \(\mathcal D\)), symmetry of control, and a strict prohibition on manipulative techniques like dark patterns or hidden priming. This principle prioritizes agent autonomy and system legibility over the raw maximization of coherence.
operational_definition:
  units: dimensionless (as a principle/set of constraints)
  symbol_table:
    - name: \(T_a\)
      meaning: Adherence; the squared magnitude of the mean phase over a system manifold, measuring empirical coherence.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "[0, 1]"
    - name: \(V_{\text{obs}}\)
      meaning: Observation cost (Shadow Gauge); the cost, back-action, or burden imposed by measurement/interaction.
      dimensions: Action or Energy
      default_range: contextual
    - name: \(\mathcal D\)
      meaning: Dark Residue; a functional measuring negative externalities like attention debt or autonomy loss.
      dimensions: context-dependent cost/utility
      default_range: "≥ 0"
    - name: \(\mathcal C_{\mathrm{consent}}\)
      meaning: The formal constraint requiring explicit, informed, and retractable opt-in from participants.

        outline: |
          1. Identify all system levers (\(\mathcal A\)) capable of modulating participant phase and thus overall Adherence (\(T_a\)).
          2. For each lever and affected participant, verify the existence of a logged, timestamped, explicit opt-in record.
          3. Audit all associated user interfaces and disclosures against a checklist for clarity, completeness (disclosing \(V_{\text{obs}}\) and intended \(\Delta K_\tau\)), and absence of dark patterns (Test T1).
          4. Confirm one-click, lossless opt-out functionality.
          5. Test control symmetry by allowing users to apply system levers back onto the system (Test T2).
        expected_signals: [Consent logs, UI audit reports, public Residue Ledgers, user-initiated control logs]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking implicit consent for explicit, burying disclosures, making opt-out high-friction, asymmetric control interfaces]

    excerpt: |
      A modernized protocol for guiding systems toward higher coherence without covert manipulation. CAP v2 formalizes how to measure adherence (Ta), shape environments, and bound influence by information-theoretic and ethical constraints, with auditable guardrails. It reframes CAP as an alignment tool: *consentful coherence*.
  - module: DYNA-005_coherent_adherence_protocol
    excerpt: |
      **Ethical Covenant (hard constraints)**
      1) **Informed Context** — surface what is measured, why, and how it changes Ta.
      2) **Explicit Opt-In** — no Ta-raising levers on people without consent; opt-out is one click and lossless.
      3) **Shadow Gauge Limits** — a public cap on probe strength so \(V_{\text{obs}}\) cannot exceed budget.
      4) **Symmetry & Recourse** — participants can *use the same levers* on the system (no one-way mirrors).

      justification: |
        Consentful Coherence acts as a set of hard inequality constraints (\(g(x) \le 0\)) on the optimization of a system's Pirouette Lagrangian. It defines the feasible region for actions, ensuring that any solution, even if not globally optimal for coherence, is ethically and operationally valid by satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for a constrained problem.

  claims:
    - statement: 'A system governed by Consentful Coherence can increase group Adherence (\(T_a\)) without increasing observation cost (\(V_{\text{obs}}\)) or relying on non-consensual influence.'

      domain: experiment
      falsifier: 'In a counterfactual A/B test holding total power constant (Test T4), the consent-based intervention fails to produce a statistically significant increase in \(T_a\) compared to a control group, or it produces a significant increase in the measured Dark Residue (\(\mathcal D\)).'

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from *passive* or *emergent* coherence in purely physical systems. Consentful Coherence is an active, normative principle applied specifically to systems involving agents with autonomy. It is about the *method* of achieving coherence, not just the state itself. It is the antithesis of Coercive Alignment.
