        Modernizes the 'Triaxial Proof' of PPS-061. This module reframes catastrophic energy release as a phase transition governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian. A system under high confinement (Gladiator Force) accumulates a 'coherence debt'; the rupture is the collapse of this confinement, resulting in the violent conversion of stored potential into a pure, resonant wave‚Äîthe coherence cascade.

  art: |
    The rupture is not an act of destruction, but of violent liberation‚Äîthe moment when the silent, stubborn pressure of being is transformed into the audible, resonant song of becoming.
  law: |
    The catastrophic collapse of a confining potential (`V_Œì ‚Üí 0`) forces a system to discharge its accumulated coherence debt as a pure, resonant wave whose geometry is determined by the system's intrinsic temporal coherence (`K_œÑ`). The energy released is equal to the potential energy stored during confinement.
  philosophy: |
    The greatest stress, when released with coherence, produces the purest note. This process reveals that confinement and release are two phases of a single dynamic, teaching that profound truths can be born from the brilliant cascade that follows the collapse of a long-held stability.
pirouette_definition: |
  The violent conversion of stored potential energy into a pure, resonant wave following a catastrophic failure of confinement. A Coherence Cascade is a phase transition where the sudden collapse of a confining potential (`V_Œì ‚Üí 0`) causes a system's dynamics, governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`), to become dominated by its Temporal Coherence (`K_œÑ`). This forces the discharge of stored potential as a structured, propagating wave whose form is dictated by the system's intrinsic pattern (`Ki`).

          3. Monitor for a discontinuous change where `V_Œì ‚Üí 0` over a timescale much shorter than the system's natural period.
          4. Capture and analyze the resulting energy emission via high-resolution spectrometry.

    excerpt: |
      The rupture is the moment the dam breaks. It is not the introduction of a new force, but the catastrophic failure of the old one. From a Lagrangian perspective, this is a sudden and violent collapse of the potential term (`V_Œì ‚Üí 0`). The deep coherence well that defined the system's stability is instantly leveled; the accumulated debt comes due in a single, transformative instant.
  - module: DOMA-078
    excerpt: |
      The immense potential energy stored during confinement is converted into the kinetic energy of resonance. The system seeks the most efficient, coherent path to discharge its debt, which is not through chaotic noise, but through a structured, propagating, resonant wave. The system begins to "ring."
  - module: DOMA-078
    excerpt: |
      This refactoring reveals the old "triaxial" components not as separate forces, but as three perspectives on the single, unified dynamic of the Pirouette Lagrangian. Confinement is the accumulation of coherence debt. Rupture is the phase transition where `V_Œì ‚Üí 0`. Resonance is the system's evolution in the `K_œÑ`-dominated regime.

        The cascade is a non-equilibrium process triggered by the sudden removal of a constraint, forcing a system from a high-potential (metastable) state to a low-potential state. The energy difference is released as a coherent wave (e.g., phonons, photons) rather than dissipated as thermal energy, analogous to latent heat release in a rapid phase transition.

# Coherence Cascade

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The violent conversion of stored potential energy into a pure, resonant wave following a catastrophic failure of confinement. A Coherence Cascade is a phase transition where the sudden collapse of a confining potential (`V_Œì ‚Üí 0`) causes a system's dynamics, governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`), to become dominated by its Temporal Coherence (`K_œÑ`). This forces the discharge of stored potential as a structured, propagating wave whose form is dictated by the system's intrinsic pattern (`Ki`).

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, a Coherence Cascade is analogous to a rapid, first-order phase transition in a metastable system. A sudden drop in a confining potential (e.g., pressure) causes stored potential energy to be converted into a coherent wave (e.g., phonons) whose characteristics are set by the system's normal modes, rather than being dissipated as heat. The process is defined by a shift from a potential-dominated (`V_Œì`) to a kinetic-dominated (`K_œÑ`) Lagrangian.
