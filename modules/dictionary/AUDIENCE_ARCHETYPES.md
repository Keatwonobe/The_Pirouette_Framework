        Each evaluation can be tagged by **perspective**. Sample archetypes include:

        | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |

    To see a single act through many eyes; a prism that splits a deed into a spectrum of meaning, from the cold light of data to the warm glow of myth.
  law: |
    An Audience Archetype is a declared, named filter (e.g., 'Empirical', 'Mythic') that constrains the evaluation criteria applied to a Crucible's outcome. All public commentary within the Senate of Audiences must be tagged with at least one such archetype.
  philosophy: |
    Judgment is not a monolithic verdict but a multipolar conversation. By requiring evaluators to declare their epistemic lens, the framework replaces the pursuit of a single 'correct' interpretation with the richer goal of understanding an action's resonance across diverse value systems.
pirouette_definition: |
  A set of declared, standardized perspectives (e.g., Empirical, Mythic, Altruist) used to frame and tag evaluations of a Crucible's resolution. These archetypes form the basis of the Senate of Audiences, ensuring that judgments are explicitly contextualized by their underlying value system or 'judging lens'.

        outline: |
          1. A participant in the Senate of Audiences selects one or more predefined Audience Archetypes to associate with their commentary or vote.
          2. The system records this tag alongside the evaluation.
          3. Aggregated views are generated by filtering or weighting evaluations based on their declared archetype tags, allowing for analysis like "What was the consensus from a Mythic perspective?"

        pitfalls: [Archetype dilution (overly broad definitions), Strategic mis-tagging to gain influence, Insufficient archetype diversity leading to blind spots]

    excerpt: |
      A Crucible’s resolution is not final at the point of action. Instead, it enters the **Senate of Audiences**—a multipolar evaluative chamber where judgment emerges through diverse epistemic lenses.

    excerpt: |
      Each evaluation can be tagged by **perspective**. Sample archetypes include: Empirical (grounded in evidence), Mythic (focused on symbolic resonance), Nationalist (evaluates from group-interest), and more. Any person or group may cast votes or commentary from a declared lens.

      justification: |
        Just as physical events are described differently by observers in different inertial frames, a Crucible's outcome is described differently from various Audience Archetype "frames." The underlying event is the same, but its interpretation is frame-dependent. This emphasizes that there is no privileged, absolute frame for judgment.

    - target: Observer frames of reference
      rationale: |
        The analogy emphasizes that there is no privileged "absolute" frame for judgment, only a set of relative perspectives, which is central to the Senate of Audiences philosophy. It captures the essence of perspective-dependent measurement without implying strict mathematical orthogonality.

  claims:
    - statement: "Introducing a diverse set of declared Audience Archetypes for evaluation prevents the formation of a monolithic consensus and increases the perceived fairness of Crucible outcomes."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "In practice, a single archetype (e.g., 'Empirical' or 'Nationalist') consistently dominates evaluation scores and discussion, regardless of the availability of other archetypes, leading to a de facto monolithic consensus."

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'Audience Archetype' is not a psychological profile of an individual but a *declared epistemic stance* or a 'judging lens' one voluntarily adopts for the purpose of evaluation. It is a tool for structuring discourse, not for classifying people.

# Audience Archetypes

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A set of declared, standardized perspectives (e.g., Empirical, Mythic, Altruist) used to frame and tag evaluations of a Crucible's resolution. These archetypes form the basis of the Senate of Audiences, ensuring that judgments are explicitly contextualized by their underlying value system or 'judging lens'.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Audience Archetypes function as **observer frames of reference** in classical or relativistic mechanics. Just as an event's coordinates and dynamics are measured differently by observers in relative motion, a Crucible's outcome is evaluated differently from the perspective of each archetype. There is no absolute or privileged frame; rather, the goal is to understand the invariant properties of the action as seen through multiple, explicitly declared epistemic viewpoints.
