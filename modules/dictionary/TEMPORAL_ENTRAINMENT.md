    A powerful idea is not a weight that pulls you down, but a song so steady it teaches your own thoughts its rhythm. To believe is to have the beat of your mind lock into the beat of the world.
  law: |
    A resonant system (a mind) navigating a coherence manifold will follow a geodesic that minimizes its action by synchronizing its frequency with the dominant local resonance (a Coherence Well), a process whose strength is proportional to the well's Coherence Gradient (‚àáùìõ_p).
  philosophy: |
    This concept reframes influence and belief away from static force and toward dynamic resonance. It explains why deeply held paradigms feel effortless (Laminar Flow) and dissent feels costly (Turbulent Flow), rooting ideology in the physics of time and rhythm rather than the geometry of space.
pirouette_definition: |
  The process by which a Coherence Well's powerful, self-stabilizing resonant pattern guides a mind's thought process into its own rhythm. This synchronization occurs as the mind follows a geodesic of maximal coherence on the manifold, altering its internal frequency to match that of the well, resulting in a state of low-energy, high-coherence Laminar Flow.

          1.  Identify the core, high-coherence concepts (KœÑ peaks) within a corpus of discourse to locate Coherence Well centers.
          2.  Introduce novel information or arguments into the discourse network.
          3.  Track the conceptual trajectory of the new information. Entrainment is confirmed if the trajectory bends toward and integrates with the pre-existing KœÑ peak, following the path predicted by the Coherence Gradient.

      The "gravity" of such an idea is not a pull, but a resonance that entrains thought into its rhythm, a current that guides consciousness along a path of least resistance. This module provides the tools to map these riverbeds and understand their profound influence on the flow of the mind.
  - module: DOMA-120
    excerpt: |
      A mind, itself a resonant system, does not get "pulled" by an idea in the classical sense. Its trajectory is altered as it navigates the coherence manifold, a process governed by Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001). To think *within* a paradigm is to experience a state of Laminar Flow. The world makes sense and conclusions feel effortless because one's internal rhythm is in harmony with the powerful song of the well.

        The Coherence Well acts as a powerful external driving oscillator (frequency Œ©, coupling K) acting upon a smaller oscillator (a mind, natural frequency œâ‚ÇÄ). Entrainment occurs when the mind's oscillator phase-locks with the driver, adopting its frequency Œ©. This aligns with the description of a mind's rhythm synchronizing with a well's "powerful song."

  disambiguation: |
    Temporal Entrainment is distinct from intellectual agreement or persuasion. Agreement is a static state of assent to a proposition. Entrainment is a dynamic process of rhythmic capture, where the *process* of thinking itself synchronizes with an external pattern, often pre-rationally. One can be entrained without being fully persuaded, feeling an intuitive "flow" toward a conclusion.

# Temporal Entrainment

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The process by which a Coherence Well's powerful, self-stabilizing resonant pattern guides a mind's thought process into its own rhythm. This synchronization occurs as the mind follows a geodesic of maximal coherence on the manifold, altering its internal frequency to match that of the well, resulting in a state of low-energy, high-coherence Laminar Flow.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of classical dynamics, Temporal Entrainment is analogous to the **synchronization of coupled oscillators**. A Coherence Well acts as a powerful, stable driving oscillator, and a mind is a smaller oscillator whose phase and frequency are captured by the driver. The mind settles into a low-energy, phase-locked state corresponding to the effortless state of `Laminar Flow` within a dominant paradigm. Resisting this process requires a continuous energy input to prevent synchronization.
