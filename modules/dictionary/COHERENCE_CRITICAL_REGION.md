    A storm-cell of social energy, the specific volume where whispers of dissent coalesce into the roar of a cascade. It is the crucible in which the system's fate is measured before it is sealed.
  law: |
    A Coherence-critical region is the minimal social volume over which the Curl Threshold (Θ) becomes a scale-invariant, predictive indicator of systemic instability. Its boundary (r_c) is empirically located where the spatial variance of Θ stabilizes (dΘ/dr ≈ 0).
  philosophy: |
    The framework rejects global, monolithic analysis. Instability is always local first; Ωc is the formalization of 'local,' the specific social petri dish where the culture of a cascade is grown and can be observed before it spreads.
pirouette_definition: |
  A coherence-critical region (Ωc) is a mesoscale social cluster, such as a neighborhood, an online community, or a network of firms, that serves as the specific integration volume for calculating the Curl Threshold (Θ). It is defined as the smallest contiguous social volume where the variance of Θ stabilizes across spatial scales, indicating that the region is behaving as a coherent unit on the verge of a phase transition. Its identification is a prerequisite for diagnosing systemic risk and targeting interventions.

        Ωc acts as the minimal volume over which a macroscopic observable (Θ) becomes meaningful and scale-invariant, analogous to how a block in a renormalization group procedure averages microscopic degrees of freedom.

    Distinguish from 'critical region' in statistics, which refers to the set of values that leads to rejecting the null hypothesis. In Pirouette, Ωc is a physical or social volume, not a region in a test-statistic's value space. It is also distinct from the system's total volume Ω.

# Coherence-critical region

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A coherence-critical region (Ωc) is a mesoscale social cluster, such as a neighborhood, an online community, or a network of firms, that serves as the specific integration volume for calculating the Curl Threshold (Θ). It is defined as the smallest contiguous social volume where the variance of Θ stabilizes across spatial scales, indicating that the region is behaving as a coherent unit on the verge of a phase transition. Its identification is a prerequisite for diagnosing systemic risk and targeting interventions.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of statistical mechanics, a Coherence-critical region is analogous to a correlation volume near a phase transition. It represents the minimal social 'block' over which the order parameter—in this case, the Curl Threshold (Θ)—becomes a coherent, scale-invariant quantity, signaling the onset of collective behavior. Identifying this region is akin to measuring the system at its critical correlation length, providing a predictive window into an impending systemic cascade.
