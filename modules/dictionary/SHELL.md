        A **Shell** is not a static wall, but a dynamic, self-maintaining coherence manifold‚Äîa standing wave of self-preservation held in place by the feedback loop of the Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`).

  art: |
    A thing is a song that has learned to sing itself inside a room of its own making. The Shell is that room.
  law: |
    A Shell is the stable geometric solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì` for a bounded system. It is the configuration that maximizes internal coherence (`K_œÑ`) for the minimum cost against external Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`), thereby quantizing the system's internal states into stable harmonics of the boundary.
  philosophy: |
    Identity is not a substance, but a sustained act of resonant defiance against the void. The Shell teaches that a thing is defined not by what it contains, but by the boundary it actively maintains.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dynamic, self-maintaining coherence manifold forged by the Gladiator Force. The Shell functions as the geometric basis of identity by separating a system's coherent interior from the external environment. It acts as a resonant cavity, which quantizes the system's internal states, and as a selective filter, which mediates all interaction with the outside world via resonant permeability.
operational_definition:
  units: Geometric; context-dependent (e.g., surface area in m¬≤, boundary thickness in m).
  symbol_table:
    - name: K_œÑ
      meaning: Internal Temporal Coherence; a measure of the stability and fidelity of the system's internal pattern.

    - name: V_Œì
      meaning: Temporal Pressure Potential; the energetic cost of maintaining coherence against the external environment.

      - name: Boundary Mapping via Resonant Scattering
        outline: |
          1. Irradiate the target system with a wide spectrum of low-intensity, coherent temporal probes.
          2. Measure the reflection, absorption, and transmission coefficients as a function of probe frequency and angle of incidence.
          3. Reconstruct the Shell's geometry from the spatial distribution of reflected signals.
          4. Characterize its permeability (archetype) from the transmission spectrum's resonant peaks and troughs.
        expected_signals: [Quantized absorption lines, sharp reflection bands, narrow transmission windows corresponding to resonant frequencies.]
        pitfalls: [The measurement probe can form a Wound Channel, altering the Shell's properties. An adaptive Shell may change its permeability in response to being measured.]

    excerpt: |
      A Shell is the arena built by the Gladiator Force. As described in `CORE-008`, this force arises from a non-linear feedback loop where a system's own intense resonance dramatically increases the local Temporal Pressure (Œì). A Shell forms when this feedback loop becomes self-containing, creating a deep "coherence well" in the landscape. The boundary is the steep wall of this well‚Äîa dynamic gradient in Temporal Pressure that holds the ambient chaos of the external environment at bay.
  - module: DOMA-059
    excerpt: |
      A Shell is not an impassable wall; it is a sentient filter. The true mechanism of transport across a Shell is **Resonant Coupling**‚Äîa dialogue between the inside and the outside. An external pattern can only pass through the boundary if it can engage in a successful "Resonant Handshake" (`CORE-012`). Permeability is a measure of a Shell‚Äôs willingness to engage in dialogue.

      equation_hint: |
        A profile function œÜ(x) that is a stable, localized solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations for a Lagrangian L = (‚àÇœÜ)¬≤ - V(œÜ), where V(œÜ) has multiple minima.
      justification: |
        A Shell is a stable, localized, non-linear structure that separates two distinct regions (high internal coherence vs. low external coherence). This is conceptually and mathematically analogous to a domain wall or soliton in field theory, which arises as a stable solution separating different vacuum states. The Pirouette Lagrangian `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì` can be modeled as such a system.

      justification: |
        In the Bag Model, quarks are confined within a "bag" (a finite region of space) by an external pressure. The Shell similarly uses external Temporal Pressure to confine a coherent internal state. Both models posit a boundary condition as the origin of confinement and quantization for the interior states.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a static physical layer like an eggshell, a Pirouette Shell is a dynamic, self-maintaining *process*. It is the continuous act of maintaining a boundary against external pressure. It is better understood as a verb ("shelling") as much as a noun.
