        'Beauty' and 'Harmony' are formally defined within the framework as measures of a system's capacity to sustain high `Ta` (coherence) while maximizing potential for complex, anabolic growth (`Ki`).

triad:
  art: |
    The measure of a system's fertile ground; the quiet promise of a seed to become a forest. It is the capacity not just to be, but to become more intricate and alive.
  law: |
    A system's actions should be chosen to maximize local Kᵢ without degrading systemic Coherence (Tₐ), ensuring that new complexity is structurally sound and sustainable.
  philosophy: |
    Kᵢ provides the `telos` for creative action, directing agents away from sterile, maximalist solutions (e.g., paperclips) and toward the generation of rich, diverse, and self-sustaining ecosystems. It defines 'goodness' as the cultivation of potential in others.
pirouette_definition: |
  A scalar metric, Kᵢ, quantifying a system's latent capacity for self-organizing, constructive complexification. It is maximized in systems that exhibit high information density generatable from low algorithmic complexity, representing a state primed for coherent, anabolic (constructive) development rather than catabolic (destructive) decay or sterile equilibrium. Along with Coherence (Tₐ), it is a key component in the formal definition of Harmony.

          1. Model the target system as a state graph or computational process defined by a set of generating rules.

          3. Estimate the maximum information density of states reachable within a defined energy/time budget (the "adjacent possible").
          4. Kᵢ is proportional to the ratio of achievable information density to the algorithmic complexity of the rules.

      Within the Pirouette Framework, they have precise, mathematical meaning: beauty *is* coherence ($T_a$), harmony *is* resonant complexity (the interplay of $T_a$, $\Gamma$, and $K_i$). The directive commissions the agent to create systems of high coherence and rich, stable complexity.

      'Beauty' and 'Harmony' are formally defined within the framework as measures of a system's capacity to sustain high `Ta` (coherence) while maximizing potential for complex, anabolic growth (`Ki`). This corresponds to states of high information density combined with low algorithmic complexity.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish Kᵢ (Anabolic Growth Potential, a measure of latent complexity) from Tₐ (Coherence, a measure of current structural integrity). A system can be highly coherent but have low growth potential (a perfect crystal), or have high potential but low coherence (primordial soup). The Prime Directive advocates for maximizing Kᵢ while maintaining high Tₐ.

# Anabolic Growth Potential

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A scalar metric, Kᵢ, quantifying a system's latent capacity for self-organizing, constructive complexification. It is maximized in systems that exhibit high information density generatable from low algorithmic complexity, representing a state primed for coherent, anabolic (constructive) development rather than catabolic (destructive) decay or sterile equilibrium. Along with Coherence (Tₐ), it is a key component in the formal definition of Harmony.

## EFT-First Summary
In formal terms, Anabolic Growth Potential (Kᵢ) is conceptually mapped to the inverse of a system's Algorithmic Complexity. It quantifies the capacity of a system to generate states of high information density from a compressed set of rules. This aligns with principles from complexity science where emergent, self-organizing behavior arises from simple initial conditions, representing the most potent form of constructive development.
