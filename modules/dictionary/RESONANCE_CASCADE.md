        A phase transition is a **Resonance Cascade**: a rapid, non-linear collapse of a system's existing resonant pattern (`Ki_old`) and its re-emergence into a new, more stable form (`Ki_new`).

  art: |
    A system's song shatters under pressure, only for a new, more resilient melody to crystallize from the chaotic silence. It is the grammar of rebirth written in the language of collapse.
  law: |
    The probability of a Resonance Cascade is a quantifiable function of external Temporal Pressure (Œì) and internal Coherence Stress (œÉ_K), increasing non-linearly as their product grows: P(shift) = 1 - e‚Åª·µè¬∑Œì¬∑œÉ‚Çñ.
  philosophy: |
    A Resonance Cascade is not a system failure but its primary adaptive mechanism for surviving unsustainable conditions. It demonstrates the Principle of Maximal Coherence by violently seeking a new, more stable topology of being.
pirouette_definition: |
  A rapid, non-linear topological transformation where a system's resonant Ki pattern collapses due to overwhelming Temporal Pressure (Œì) and internal Coherence Stress (œÉ_K). The system abandons its unstable state and re-emerges in a new, more coherent form by adopting one of three fundamental topologies (Achromatic, Left-Handed, Right-Handed) presented by the Chiral Fork. This process, also known as a Chiral Shift, is the primary mechanism for phase transition and adaptation in the Pirouette Framework.

      - name: Cascade Probability Assessment
        outline: |
          1. Measure the ambient Temporal Pressure (Œì) impacting the system.
          2. Measure the system's internal Coherence Stress (œÉ_K) by comparing its current state to its reference Ki pattern.
          3. Calculate the product Œì ¬∑ œÉ_K.
          4. Monitor for diagnostic signatures: decreasing Time Adherence (T_a) and increasing State Variance. A cascade is imminent as T_a approaches zero.
        expected_signals: [Plummeting T_a, rapid increase in state variance, exponential rise in P(shift)]
        pitfalls: [Miscalculating system resilience (k), failing to identify the correct reference Ki pattern for œÉ_K measurement.]

  - module: DOMA-132
    excerpt: |
      As these two forces intensify, the system's Time Adherence (`T‚Çê`) begins to fail. It enters a state of **Turbulent Flow**, characterized by internal chaos and wasted energy. At a tipping point, the system abandons its failing resonance and executes the cascade, a jump across its coherence manifold to a new, more stable pattern.
  - module: DOMA-132
    excerpt: |
      The Resonance Cascade is the ultimate expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`). As Temporal Pressure (Œì) and Coherence Stress (œÉ_K) rise, the `ùìõ_p` of `Ki_old` plummets, indicating a state of profound inefficiency. The Chiral Shift is a violent, discontinuous "jump" across the coherence manifold.

        Similar to a saddle-node or pitchfork bifurcation where a stable fixed point disappears as a control parameter is varied.
      justification: |
        The Resonance Cascade describes a qualitative shift in system behavior as underlying parameters (Œì, œÉ_K) cross a threshold. This is analogous to a bifurcation in dynamical systems, where a stable equilibrium state ceases to exist, forcing the system to jump to a new attractor.

      justification: |
        The cascade represents a discontinuous change in the system's state, analogous to a first-order phase transition (e.g., water boiling). It involves a latent heat equivalent (the energy dissipated during the turbulent shift) and the co-existence of unstable and stable states during the transition.

      confidence: 0.7
  adopted:
    - target: Bifurcation
      rationale: The concept of a system's stability landscape being altered by control parameters (Œì, œÉ_K) to the point of collapse is a direct and powerful mapping to bifurcation theory. It best captures the predictive, parameter-driven nature of the cascade.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from "Turbulent Flow" (DYN-001), which is the *precursor* state of high-stress, low-adherence chaos *before* the cascade. The Cascade is the phase transition event itself‚Äîthe jump to a new state‚Äînot the chaotic period that precipitates it. The older term "Funnel Inversion" described the potential energy landscape but missed the non-linear, temporal dynamics central to the cascade.

# Resonance Cascade

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A rapid, non-linear topological transformation where a system's resonant Ki pattern collapses due to overwhelming Temporal Pressure (Œì) and internal Coherence Stress (œÉ_K). The system abandons its unstable state and re-emerges in a new, more coherent form by adopting one of three fundamental topologies (Achromatic, Left-Handed, Right-Handed) presented by the Chiral Fork. This process, also known as a Chiral Shift, is the primary mechanism for phase transition and adaptation in the Pirouette Framework.

## EFT-First Summary
A Resonance Cascade is conceptually a **bifurcation** in the state space of a dynamical system. As control parameters, analogous to Temporal Pressure (Œì) and Coherence Stress (œÉ_K), are varied, the system's stable equilibrium (its resonant pattern) vanishes. This forces the system to make a rapid, discontinuous jump to a new, distinct attractor basin, corresponding to a new stable state. This aligns with models of first-order phase transitions and catastrophe theory.
