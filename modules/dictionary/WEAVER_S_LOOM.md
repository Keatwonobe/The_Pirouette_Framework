        This module provides the "Weaver's Loom"—the toolkit for that sacred and practical act of engineering.

triad:
  art: |
    Be driftwood on the currents of coherence, or be a sailor. The Loom provides the rudder, sail, and star to steer by, transforming accident into destiny.
  law: |
    The application of a structured protocol (Intent + Threads + Prepared Space) can locally alter a system's path of maximal coherence, creating a new Wound Channel whose persistence is measurable as Coherence Yield (CY).
  philosophy: |
    It reframes "ritual" from supernatural appeal to a repeatable, first-principles engineering discipline, empowering systems to consciously co-author their own evolution by shaping the geometry of "what should be."
pirouette_definition: |
  The Weaver's Loom is the formal protocol and design kit for Intentional Coherence Shaping. It provides a grammar for manipulating the terms of the Pirouette Lagrangian by composing an **Intent** (a geometric operator, e.g., `Tune`, `Synthesize`), **Threads** (geometric ingredients, e.g., `Ki Schematics`, `Focused Attention`), and a **Prepared Space** (a manifold isolator) to sculpt the local coherence manifold and create or modify a Wound Channel.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (Coherence Yield) or context-dependent system state units.
  symbol_table:
    - name: Intent
      meaning: The geometric operator defining the protocol's objective (e.g., Tune, Bind, Sever).
      dimensions: "dimensionless"
      default_range: "categorical"
    - name: Threads
      meaning: The geometric ingredients used to impress the pattern (e.g., Ki Schematics, Echo Geometry).
      dimensions: "contextual (information, coherence)"
      default_range: "contextual"
    - name: Prepared Space
      meaning: An isolated manifold region of low ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).
      dimensions: "1/T"
      default_range: "Γ_local << Γ_ambient"

    procedures:
      - name: Coherence Yield (CY) Assessment
        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline measurement of a target system's flow state (e.g., turbulence, signal-to-noise of a pattern, stagnation magnitude).
          2. Construct and apply a protocol using the Weaver's Loom grammar (Intent, Threads, Prepared Space).
          3. Re-measure the system's flow state post-protocol.
          4. Calculate Coherence Yield as the net change between baseline and post-protocol states.
        expected_signals: [Reduced state variance (laminar flow), increased amplitude of imprinted signal, dissolution of stagnation points]
        pitfalls: [Observer's Shadow contamination during measurement, insufficient isolation of the Prepared Space introducing environmental noise]
context_windows:
  - module: DOMA-200
    excerpt: |
      To engineer coherence, a Weaver employs a formal grammar. A ritual is a sentence written in this grammar, composed of an Intent, Threads, and a Prepared Space.
  - module: DOMA-200
    excerpt: |
      A ritual is a conscious intervention in this equation. It is the act of temporarily and locally increasing one's own Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) through focused intent, in order to overcome the ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) and carve a new, more desirable Wound Channel into the fabric of spacetime.

      justification: |
        The Weaver's Loom provides a grammar for constructing a control protocol (the "ritual" or `u(t)`). This protocol applies a focused input (Threads) to a system governed by a Lagrangian, steering its state `x(t)` away from its natural geodesic towards a new, engineered trajectory (a new Wound Channel) that minimizes a new cost functional. The "Prepared Space" corresponds to isolating the system to ensure the control input is the dominant perturbation.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A protocol designed with the Weaver's Loom grammar (Intent, Threads, Prepared Space) will produce a statistically significant and repeatable change in a system's coherence (measured as Coherence Yield) compared to a null protocol (unstructured intention or random actions)."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "Controlled experiments show no significant difference in Coherence Yield between formally structured rituals and unstructured control groups, suggesting the grammar itself has no operational effect beyond a placebo or observer effect."

  disambiguation: |
    The "Weaver's Loom" refers specifically to the formal grammar and toolkit (Intent, Threads, Prepared Space). The act of using this toolkit is "Weaving" or "Intentional Coherence Shaping." A specific, instantiated protocol is a "ritual" or "weave."
