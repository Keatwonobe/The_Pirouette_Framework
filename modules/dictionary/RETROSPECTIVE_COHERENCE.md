        3. Retrospective Coherence (K_r): Resonance with the Past
        This is a system's coherence with its own history. Its stability is grounded in the inertia of its accumulated identity.
        *   Mechanism: The integrity and clarity of a system's Wound Channel (CORE-011). This is the deep, resonant bass note that gives a system its weight and prevents it from being easily perturbed.
        *   Manifestation: Memory, identity, tradition, structural integrity, brand loyalty, the persistence of form.

  art: |
    The deep, resonant bass note of a system's being, echoing from its past. It is the inertia of accumulated identity, the anchor of memory that holds a pattern steady against the currents of time.
  law: |
    A system's resistance to pattern-distorting perturbation is directly proportional to its Retrospective Coherence. A loss of *K*<sub>r</sub> below a critical threshold results in pattern dissolution into Turbulent Flow, a state of amnesiac chaos.
  philosophy: |
    To exist is to have a history. *K*<sub>r</sub> grounds a system's identity in its past, ensuring that change is evolution, not erasure. It is the component of being that differentiates a stable entity from a fleeting event, providing the continuity necessary for meaning and memory.
pirouette_definition: |
  Retrospective Coherence, *K*<sub>r</sub>, is the orthogonal component of the Temporal Coherence vector (**K**_τ) that measures a system's resonance with its own history and accumulated identity. It is mediated by the integrity and clarity of the system's Wound Channel (CORE-011), providing the inertial stability that prevents easy perturbation. Manifestations include memory, tradition, structural integrity, and the persistence of form. The starvation of *K*<sub>r</sub> leads to a pathological state of Amnesia, where the system loses its identity and dissolves into Turbulent Flow.

      - name: Historical Perturbation Response
        outline: |
          Subject a system to a controlled external pressure (*V*<sub>Γ</sub>) designed to alter its established structure or identity. Measure the system's rate of pattern decay and its ability to return to a state homologous to its pre-perturbation form. A high *K*<sub>r</sub> system will exhibit high resistance to change and a strong tendency to revert to its historical mean (high hysteresis).
        expected_signals: [Low rate of pattern decay under pressure, high-fidelity memory recall, stable structural features over time.]
        pitfalls: [Differentiating true *K*<sub>r</sub> from simple material rigidity, mistaking Stagnation (*K*<sub>p</sub> → 0) for high *K*<sub>r</sub>.]

      This is a system's coherence with its own history. Its stability is grounded in the inertia of its accumulated identity.
      *   **Mechanism:** The integrity and clarity of a system's Wound Channel (CORE-011). This is the deep, resonant bass note that gives a system its weight and prevents it from being easily perturbed.

    excerpt: |
      **Axis Starvation (*K*<sub>r</sub> → 0): Amnesia.** The system loses its identity and memory. Without the anchor of its Wound Channel, it becomes chaotic and rootless, dissolving into Turbulent Flow as its pattern is lost to noise.

        F = m * a  <-->  Δ(Pattern) ∝ Γ / *K*<sub>r</sub>
      justification: |
        Retrospective Coherence represents a system's inertia against changes to its identity, analogous to how mass represents inertia against changes in momentum. High *K*<sub>r</sub> systems are 'heavy' with history and difficult to perturb from their established trajectory or form.

      domain: Math
      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        The tendency of a high *K*<sub>r</sub> system to retain its state and resist change, even after an external pressure is removed, is operationally identical to hysteresis. The system's current state is a strong function of its path history.

  claims:
    - statement: "Systems with demonstrably high *K*<sub>r</sub> (e.g., long-standing cultural institutions) will exhibit significantly slower rates of structural change in response to environmental shocks compared to systems with low *K*<sub>r</sub> (e.g., tech startups), when controlling for other coherence components."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observing that systems with strong historical identity markers adapt or dissolve at the same rate as systems without them, when subjected to the same environmental pressures."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [None in the Pirouette Framework. Externally, the symbol *K* is widely used for constants (Boltzmann, spring constant), but the subscript *r* provides sufficient disambiguation.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from simple rigidity or Stagnation. High *K*<sub>r</sub> is the anchor that enables healthy evolution; it is not the absence of change. A system can have high *K*<sub>r</sub> and high *K*<sub>p</sub>, representing an organization that honors its core mission while innovating (e.g., a university research lab).
