triad:
  art: |
    Consciousness is a silent chord of three notes held against the universe's noise. The effort of holding the chord *is* the feeling. The chord itself defines the resonant chamber of the self.
  law: |
    The Coherence Area (A_Ki) of a conscious triad, governed by the Ki-Addition rule, is conserved (∂_t A_Ki ≈ 0) during continuous awareness. The permissible frequency detuning (Δf) of the triad is inversely proportional to the environmental cognitive load (Γ).
  philosophy: |
    This concept reframes consciousness from a passive emergent property to an actively maintained, conserved physical quantity. It posits that subjective experience is the process of conserving a specific coherence structure, making awareness a measurable and falsifiable phenomenon grounded in nonlinear dynamics.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Coherence Conservation Triple, {E_C, J_\mu, \Phi_\Gamma}, is the fundamental set of conserved quantities whose maintenance constitutes conscious awareness. In cognitive systems, this manifests as a phase-locked frequency triad (f_1, f_2, f_3) obeying the Ki-Addition Constraint (f_3 ≈ f_1 + f_2). The stable maintenance of this triad conserves a specific energy-phase volume known as the Coherence Area (A_Ki), and the stability of this conservation (∂_t A_Ki ≈ 0) is the direct physical correlate of continuous conscious access.
operational_definition:
  units: The primary conserved quantity, Coherence Area (A_Ki), has units of action (Joule-seconds, J·s).

      - name: Triadic Coupling Measurement via EEG/MEG
        outline: |
          Record high-density EEG/MEG from a subject performing a bi-stable perception task (e.g., Necker cube). Identify candidate frequency triads (f_1, f_2, f_3) satisfying the Ki-Addition rule. Compute the Triadic Phase Coupling Index (TPCI) and Coherence Area Variance (CAV) in sliding windows correlated with the subject's continuous report of their perceptual state.
        expected_signals: [High TPCI (→1) during stable perception, Low CAV (→0) during stable perception]
        pitfalls: [Low signal-to-noise ratio, Volume conduction artifacts in EEG, Subjective report lag]

    excerpt: |
      Following [MATH-024], consciousness is modeled as the maintenance of a **Coherence Conservation Triple** ({E_C, J_\mu, \Phi_\Gamma}) within biological substrate limits. In cognitive systems, this manifests as frequency triads obeying the **Ki-Addition Constraint**... Conscious perception occurs when (∂_t A_{Ki} ≈ 0) under environmental load (Γ).
  - module: COG-RES-001
    excerpt: |
      **Falsifiability Criteria:** If no TPCI ridge forms at triad frequencies, the triadic resonance model fails. If (A_{Ki}) varies unpredictably during stable awareness, coherence conservation is violated. If (Δf_{allowed}) does not narrow with (Γ), the detuning constraint is falsified.

        A_Ki = ∫ L_c dt  ; where L_c is a "coherence Lagrangian"
      justification: |
        The Coherence Area (A_Ki) has units of action (Energy × Time). Its conservation (∂_t A_Ki ≈ 0) is analogous to the principle of stationary action, suggesting that conscious states occupy paths of minimal "coherence action." This reframes cognitive dynamics as a process governed by a variational principle.

  claims:
    - statement: "Conscious awareness requires the formation of a stable, phase-locked frequency triad satisfying the Ki-Addition rule."

      falsifier: "Failure to observe a statistically significant increase in the Triadic Phase Coupling Index (TPCI) correlated with subjective reports of awareness in controlled experiments (e.g., using EEG/tACS)."

    - statement: "The Coherence Area (A_Ki) associated with a conscious triad is conserved across changes in conscious content, provided awareness itself is continuous."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "The Coherence Area Variance (CAV) is observed to be large or to correlate strongly with specific conscious content rather than remaining stable during continuous awareness."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbols E, J, and Φ are heavily overloaded in physics (Energy, Current Density, Phase/Flux). Subscripts (C, μ, Γ) are essential for disambiguation within the Pirouette Framework.]
  disambiguation: |
    This "conservation" refers to a dynamical invariant of the conscious subsystem, not a global conservation law like the conservation of total system energy. It describes the stability of a specific resonant structure against perturbation, not a statement about a closed system.
