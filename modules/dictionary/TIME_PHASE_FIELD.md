  law: |
    Physics must be invariant under a local, arbitrary relabeling (shift) of the Time-Phase Field, θ(x) → θ(x) + α(x). This invariance is only preserved by introducing a compensating connection A_μ (the photon potential) that transforms as A_μ → A_μ + (1/q)∂_μα(x).
  philosophy: |
    U(1) gauge symmetry is not a fundamental axiom but a "conservation of coherence." It is the freedom to relabel the zero-point of the substrate's internal clock at every spacetime point without changing physical reality. The photon exists to enforce this consistency.

  A fundamental scalar field, θ(x), representing the local phase of the complex order parameter Φ(x) that constitutes the time-first substrate. Gradients of the field, ∂_μθ, represent a current within the substrate. The requirement of local phase-shift invariance, θ(x) → θ(x) + α(x), gives rise to the U(1) gauge symmetry of quantum electrodynamics, with the photon A_μ emerging as the necessary Goldstone connection.

          The field θ(x) is not directly observable; only its gauge-invariant dynamics are. Its properties are inferred by measuring the properties of its associated gauge boson (the photon). Precision tests of QED, such as measurements of vacuum dispersion, vacuum birefringence, or violations of Lorentz invariance for photons, are direct tests of the high-energy form of the substrate Lagrangian P(X_A, ρ).

        In superfluids, the macroscopic quantum wavefunction can be written Ψ = |Ψ|e^(iθ). The gradient of the phase θ gives the superflow velocity. This is mathematically analogous to the Time-Phase Field, where gradients generate a substrate current that sources the electromagnetic field. The emergence of a massless mode (phonons/photons) from phase dynamics is a common feature.

    This θ(x) is a spacetime scalar field, not a geometric angle. Unlike a simple phase, its spacetime gradients ∂_μθ are components of a physical Noether current J^μ_θ. It should be understood as the phase of the substrate's fundamental order parameter.

# Time-Phase Field

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Time-Phase Field, θ(x), is a fundamental scalar field representing the local phase of the time-first substrate. Its core principle is that physical laws are invariant under local shifts in this phase, θ(x) → θ(x) + α(x). This "local time-relabeling" freedom is equivalent to U(1) gauge symmetry. The photon emerges as the connection field required to maintain this symmetry, and its dynamics are governed by the "stiffness" of the substrate against phase gradients.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of effective field theory, the Time-Phase Field θ(x) is the Goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken global U(1) symmetry of the Pirouette substrate. When this symmetry is gauged, θ(x) is absorbed by the gauge boson (the photon) via the Higgs mechanism. However, in the Pirouette construction, the gauging is not a choice but a necessity, and the Maxwell term for the photon arises from the "stiffness" of the underlying medium against gradients in the phase field, rather than being posited axiomatically.
