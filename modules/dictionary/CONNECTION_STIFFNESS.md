    Two numbers make light: the softness of time when you try to twist its clocks, which sets the connection stiffness; and the number of windings a particle’s own clock must make to return home. Their product is electric charge, and their dance sets the brightness of the universe.
  law: |
    The kinetic term for the emergent photon field is generated with a non-canonical normalization, `L_γ = - (1/4g²) FμνFμν`. The coefficient `g⁻²`, the Connection Stiffness, is a physical parameter of the temporal medium. It is measurable via its contribution to the fine-structure constant, `α = q²g² / (4πħc)`.
  philosophy: |
    This parameter grounds electromagnetism in a physical, 'mechanical' property of the temporal medium, demystifying the origin of the gauge coupling. By splitting the electric charge `e` into a dynamic stiffness `g` and a quantized geometric winding `q`, it provides a concrete mechanism for predicting and constraining potential variations of fundamental constants.
pirouette_definition: |
  A scalar parameter representing the energetic cost of curvature in the temporal connection field `Aμ`, which manifests as the emergent electromagnetic field. It appears as the coefficient of the Maxwell kinetic term, `L_γ = -(1/4g²) FμνFμν`, prior to canonical normalization. A higher stiffness (larger `g⁻²`) corresponds to a greater resistance to generating field curvature, and thus a weaker effective coupling `g`.

          1. Measure the fine-structure constant, `α(μ)`, at a specific energy scale `μ` using precision techniques (e.g., electron g-2, atom interferometry).
          2. Determine the Berry-quantized charge unit `q` from the principles of `MATH-QED-003`. By convention, this is often normalized.
          3. Calculate `g` using the relation `g = sqrt(4πħcα) / q`.
          4. The Connection Stiffness is then `g⁻²`.

          2. Measure the present-day rate of change, `ȧ`, using atomic clock comparisons over long baselines.
          3. Attribute the drift `δα/α = 2(δg/g + δq/q)` to the evolution of the Γ background, thereby constraining the susceptibility of `g` to `⟨Γ²⟩`.

    excerpt: |
      From **MATH-QED-001–003**, the time-first Lagrangian near the Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM) reads
      `\mathcal{L} = ... - \frac{1}{4g^2} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + ...`
      where `g⁻²` is the **connection stiffness** generating the Maxwell term. Under the photon rescaling `A → A/g`, the matter coupling becomes `(q g) \bar\Psi\gamma^\mu A^{(\text{phys})}_\mu \Psi`. Hence the physical electromagnetic coupling is `e = qg`.
  - module: MATH-QED-004_fine_structure_from_connection_stiffness
    excerpt: |
      Slow evolution of the Γ background perturbs the stiffnesses:
      `\frac{\delta g}{g}\sim c_g,\frac{\langle \Gamma^2\rangle}{M_\text{coh}^2}`.
      Therefore `\frac{\delta \alpha}{\alpha} = 2(\frac{\delta g}{g}+\frac{\delta q}{q})`. On the Pirouette baseline, `\langle \Gamma^2\rangle` decreases monotonically from recombination to today, so the sign of `d\alpha/dt` is **negative**.

      justification: |
        In emergent gauge theories, the kinetic term for the gauge field often appears with a non-standard normalization factor reflecting a physical property (e.g., stiffness, conductivity) of the underlying medium. `Connection Stiffness` `g⁻²` is this factor. Canonical normalization `A' = A/g_raw` makes the kinetic term `-1/4 F'²` and moves `g_raw` into the coupling constant.

    `g⁻²` is the Connection Stiffness, a specific Pirouette parameter. It is the *inverse square* of the photon field rescaling factor `g`. This `g` is a component of the electric charge `e=qg` and should not be confused with the dimensionless gyromagnetic ratio (`g-2`) or the metric tensor.

# Connection Stiffness

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A scalar parameter representing the energetic cost of curvature in the temporal connection field `Aμ`, which manifests as the emergent electromagnetic field. It appears as the coefficient of the Maxwell kinetic term, `L_γ = -(1/4g²) FμνFμν`, prior to canonical normalization. A higher stiffness (larger `g⁻²`) corresponds to a greater resistance to generating field curvature, and thus a weaker effective coupling `g`.

## EFT-First Summary
In standard Effective Field Theory, gauge fields can emerge with non-canonical kinetic terms, such as `L = -1/(4g_raw²) F²`. The Pirouette **Connection Stiffness** `g⁻²` is precisely this raw, un-normalized coefficient, interpreted as a physical property of the underlying temporal medium. To recover the standard formulation of QED, the gauge field is rescaled (`A' = A/g_raw`), which moves the coupling factor `g_raw` from the kinetic term into the interaction vertex. There, it combines with the geometric `Clock-Synchronization Charge` `q` to form the observable physical charge `e = q * g_raw`.
