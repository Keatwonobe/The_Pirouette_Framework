      snippet: |
        As per CORE-008, confinement arises from a non-linear feedback loop where a system's own resonance increases the local Temporal Pressure Gamma... A simple model for the potential inside a confinement zone (like a proton) is: V(r) = c1/r + c2*r... At large r (Confinement): The constant force term -c2 dominates. No matter how far apart you pull the particles, the restoring force never diminishes. It requires infinite energy to separate them.

    A bond that tightens the more it is stretched, like a gladiator's net thrown over escaping foes. The struggle to separate only proves the prison is real, defining the prisoner by its walls.
  law: |
    The force between two confined entities, derived from the potential V(r) = c1/r + c2*r, asymptotically approaches a non-zero constant value (-c2) as the separation distance r increases. Energy required for separation scales linearly with distance, E ‚àù r.
  philosophy: |
    Confinement is the universe's mechanism for creating stable, composite objects from resonant components. It demonstrates that self-interaction, far from being a paradox, is the very glue that holds bounded systems together against external temporal pressure.

  A fundamental interaction derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) that governs bound systems. It arises from a self-referential feedback loop where a system's own resonance increases local Temporal Pressure (Œì), creating a potential V(r) that increases linearly with distance (V ‚àù r). This results in a constant restoring force that makes infinite energy a requirement for component separation.

        outline: |
          Measure the discrete energy levels of quark-antiquark bound states (e.g., charmonium, bottomonium) via their decay products. Fit the observed spectral lines to the eigenvalues of the Schr√∂dinger equation using the potential V(r) = c1/r + c2*r. The value of the c2 parameter is extracted from the fit that best reproduces the energy level spacing.

        pitfalls: [Relativistic effects at high energies, spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions add fine structure to the potential and must be modeled.]

    excerpt: |
      At small r (Asymptotic Freedom): The c1/(r^2) term dominates. The force is weak, and the particles move freely. At large r (Confinement): The constant force term -c2 dominates. No matter how far apart you pull the particles, the restoring force never diminishes. It requires infinite energy to separate them. This proves that the principle of confinement is a direct consequence of a potential that includes a linearly increasing term, which itself is a model of the self-referential feedback loop at the heart of the Gladiator Force.

    excerpt: |
      We have followed an unbroken chain of mathematical logic from a single axiom‚Äîthe Pirouette Lagrangian‚Äîto the fundamental forces that govern the universe... We have derived them. This proves that the universe does not have a separate law for motion, a separate law for electricity, and a separate law for matter. It has one law: the law of the turn.

      justification: |
        The `c2*r` term in the Pirouette-derived potential is mathematically identical to the linear confinement term `œÉr` in the phenomenological Cornell potential, which accurately describes the interaction between a quark and an antiquark. The coefficient `c2` is directly analogous to the QCD string tension `œÉ`.

    Distinguish from the Propagating Force (e.g., Electromagnetism), which weakens with distance via an inverse-square law. The Confining Force grows stronger or remains constant with distance and only acts on systems with the requisite self-referential resonance, creating bounded, composite particles.

# Confining Force

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A fundamental interaction derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) that governs bound systems. It arises from a self-referential feedback loop where a system's own resonance increases local Temporal Pressure (Œì), creating a potential V(r) that increases linearly with distance (V ‚àù r). This results in a constant restoring force that makes infinite energy a requirement for component separation.

## EFT-First Summary
The Confining Force is the Pirouette Framework's derivation of QCD confinement. The derived potential `V(r) = c1/r + c2*r` is a direct analogue of the Cornell potential for quark-antiquark interactions. The linear term `c2*r` maps to the QCD string tension term `œÉr`, explaining why quarks are never observed in isolation and form bound states (hadrons). This model has been experimentally supported by measurements of quarkonium spectra since the 1970s.
