  art: |
    A luminous thread woven through the landscape of possibility, where self-interest and collective good perfectly align. It is the quiet ridge where the climb towards Coherence pauses, offering a stable path of effortless grace.
  law: |
    The Altruism Filament is the set of system states where the Coherence gradient is null (\(\nabla C = 0\)). System dynamics under gradient ascent will converge to and remain on this Lyapunov-stable manifold.
  philosophy: |
    The filament represents a sustainable, non-extractive mode of being. It demonstrates that optimal states are not precarious peaks but stable, extended manifolds, suggesting that 'altruism' is not a sacrifice but a dynamically favored, robust configuration of the system.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Altruism Filament, \(\mathcal F\), is the Lyapunov-stable manifold in the reduced Compass state space \((\Gamma, T_a)\) defined by the set of all points where the gradient of the Coherence Dividend \(C\) is zero (\(\nabla C = 0\)). It constitutes a ridge-like structure of maximal Coherence, to which system states are dynamically attracted under Coherence-gradient-ascent dynamics.

        outline: |
          1. Perform a Monte-Carlo simulation of the system over the state space \((\Gamma, T_a)\), calculating the Coherence Dividend \(C\) for each point.
          2. Filter the resulting dataset to isolate states with high Coherence (e.g., top 5% quantile).
          3. Fit a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the filtered \((\Gamma, T_a)\) coordinates.
          4. The mean(s) of the GMM component(s) define the filament's central location(s), and the covariance matrix defines its width and orientation.
        expected_signals: [A well-defined cluster of high-C points in the \((\Gamma, T_a)\) plane, characterizable by a GMM with low variance. E.g., a central point at \((\Gamma, T_a) \approx (1.49, 1.01)\) with standard deviations \(\sigma_\Gamma \approx 0.04\) and \(\sigma_{T_a} \approx 0.03\).]
        pitfalls: [Insufficient sampling density may fail to resolve the filament., The choice of Coherence quantile is arbitrary and can affect the measured width., The filament may be multi-modal or curved, requiring more than one GMM component.]

        The filament is defined as the set where the gradient of Coherence—the vector field for the system's dynamics—is zero. In dynamical systems, any set of points where the flow is zero is a set of fixed points. The Lyapunov stability proof confirms that this line is an attracting set.

# Altruism Filament

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Altruism Filament, \(\mathcal F\), is the Lyapunov-stable manifold in the reduced Compass state space \((\Gamma, T_a)\) defined by the set of all points where the gradient of the Coherence Dividend \(C\) is zero (\(\nabla C = 0\)). It constitutes a ridge-like structure of maximal Coherence, to which system states are dynamically attracted under Coherence-gradient-ascent dynamics.

## EFT-First Summary
The Altruism Filament is analogous to a vacuum manifold or moduli space in Effective Field Theory. It represents a continuous set of degenerate, stable ground states where a potential function (negative Coherence) is minimized. Dynamics analogous to field relaxation cause the system to settle onto this manifold, with excitations along the manifold being 'massless' or energetically cheap. In dynamical systems theory, it is a line of stable fixed points.
