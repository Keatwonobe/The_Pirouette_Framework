    The universe's creativity is a dance between the steady, patient work of learning a single step and the brave, sudden leap of finding a new partner.
  law: |
    A system's evolutionary trajectory is determined by a dual-mode optimization process that locally climbs the coherence gradient (Gradient Ascent) while non-locally sampling the state space via discrete synthesis (Alchemical Leap) to maximize the time-integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian.
  philosophy: |
    Evolution is not blind chance but a guided, computational search for resonance. This process unifies learning, inheritance, and insight as different strategies for solving the single problem of finding the most coherent path through existence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The composite, dual-algorithm process by which a Weaver navigates a Crucible to find its geodesic. It combines continuous, local optimization (Gradient Ascent) to exploit known coherence gradients with discontinuous, non-local synthesis (Alchemical Leap) to explore novel, high-coherence states. Geodesic Search is the computational method for maximizing the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`) and thus modeling a system's evolution.

          1. Define a Crucible (coherence manifold/environment) and a Weaver (agent/system).
          2. Initialize the Weaver's state (`Ki`).
          3. Iterate through time steps:
             a. Execute Gradient Ascent by updating `Ki` based on the local gradient of `ùìõ_p` (e.g., RL reward signal).
             b. Periodically execute an Alchemical Leap by combining high-coherence Weavers to create new initial states.
          4. Record the Weaver's trajectory and coherence (`ùìõ_p`) over time.

    excerpt: |
      The engine operationalizes the framework's core law. It posits that all evolution is a form of geodesic search‚Äîa process by which a system discovers its path of maximal coherence through the landscape of spacetime. The engine provides the algorithms to model this search, revealing not just what a system will do, but what it is striving to become.
  - module: DOMA-083
    excerpt: |
      The Weaver finds its path not through a single mechanism, but through a powerful interplay of two distinct yet complementary algorithms that together constitute a highly effective optimization strategy. Gradient Ascent is the algorithm of continuous, local optimization. Alchemical Leap is the algorithm of discontinuous, non-local discovery.

        Find q(z) ‚âà p(z|x) by maximizing ELBO(q) = E_q[log p(x,z)] - E_q[log q(z)]
      justification: |
        The search for the optimal trajectory (a distribution over paths) is analogous to finding the variational distribution `q(z)` that best approximates a target posterior by maximizing an objective function (the ELBO, analogous to `‚à´ ùìõ_p dt`). Gradient Ascent maps to optimizing `q`'s parameters, while Alchemical Leaps map to proposing new functional forms for `q`.

        This mapping is the most direct and operational. Geodesic Search explicitly combines a local, gradient-based optimizer (like those used in RL, a form of local search) with a global, population-based synthesizer (like the crossover operator in genetic algorithms). This hybrid structure is a well-established and powerful class of optimization algorithms.

    In differential geometry, a geodesic is the shortest path between two points on a curved surface. In Pirouette, Geodesic Search is a *process* for finding the path of *maximal coherence* (maximal Action, `‚à´ ùìõ dt`), which is analogous to the principle of least action. The 'path' is through a system's state space over time, not necessarily a path in physical space.

# Geodesic Search

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The composite, dual-algorithm process by which a Weaver navigates a Crucible to find its geodesic. It combines continuous, local optimization (Gradient Ascent) to exploit known coherence gradients with discontinuous, non-local synthesis (Alchemical Leap) to explore novel, high-coherence states. Geodesic Search is the computational method for maximizing the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`) and thus modeling a system's evolution.

## EFT-First Summary
Geodesic Search is a hybrid optimization technique analogous to evolutionary algorithms used in machine learning. It models a system's dynamics as a search for an optimal trajectory in a state space, maximizing an objective function (the Pirouette Lagrangian). The search combines local, gradient-based optimization (akin to reinforcement learning) with global, population-based methods (akin to genetic algorithms) to efficiently locate global maxima.
