        This refactoring reveals the old "triaxial" components not as separate forces, but as three perspectives on the single, unified dynamic of the Pirouette Lagrangian.

  art: |
    Three silent gods in a standoff—pressure, potential, and pattern—until the arena walls collapse and only the pattern's pure song remains.
  law: |
    Catastrophic rupture is the outcome of a direct conflict between three independent forces: Confinement, Potential, and a Resonant Axis. The failure occurs when the Resonant Axis force overcomes the Confinement. This law is now considered falsified.
  philosophy: |
    The Triaxial Proof represents a necessary but incomplete step in understanding rupture. It correctly identified the key phenomenological stages (storage, trigger, release) but incorrectly assigned them to separate, competing agents rather than seeing them as emergent phases of a single, underlying Lagrangian path.

  An obsolete theoretical framework (superseded by `DOMA-078`) that modeled catastrophic energy release (rupture) as a dynamic conflict between three distinct and competing forces. These components—Confinement, Rupture Trigger, and Resonant Release—are now understood not as separate forces, but as phenomenological perspectives on a system's evolution under the Pirouette Lagrangian during a `V_Γ` collapse.

        outline: |
          Attempt to independently measure the magnitudes of the confining force, the triggering perturbation, and the resultant resonant energy. The model predicts these are separate inputs/outputs. Failure to isolate them as independent variables falsifies the model, as was demonstrated by the Coherence Cascade framework.
        expected_signals: [Independent, orthogonal force vectors]
        pitfalls: [The "forces" are not independent; they are different aspects of the same Lagrangian dynamic. The triggering "force" is the *absence* of the confining force.]

    excerpt: |
      The old framework of PPS-061 correctly described a profound dynamic—a system's ability to store immense energy under pressure and then release it as a coherent wave. However, its ontology of three competing forces was fragmented. This module refactors that insight into the modern, time-first paradigm.
  - module: DOMA-078
    excerpt: |
      The old proof required three terms because it was describing three acts of a single play. The Lagrangian is the play itself, showing that confinement and release, pressure and song, are the two natural movements of a universe governed by a single, elegant law.

        The Triaxial Proof attempts to describe a complex field-theoretic process (a phase transition) using a simplified ontology of discrete, competing forces. This is analogous to how early classical mechanics would draw separate force vectors for phenomena that are now understood through a unified potential field.

# Triaxial Proof

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An obsolete theoretical framework (superseded by `DOMA-078`) that modeled catastrophic energy release (rupture) as a dynamic conflict between three distinct and competing forces. These components—Confinement, Rupture Trigger, and Resonant Release—are now understood not as separate forces, but as phenomenological perspectives on a system's evolution under the Pirouette Lagrangian during a `V_Γ` collapse.

## EFT-First Summary
The Triaxial Proof is an obsolete internal framework concept with no direct mapping to established field theories. It is a superseded, phenomenological model that incorrectly posited three independent forces governing rupture, a process now understood as a phase transition governed by a single Lagrangian. Its primary value is historical, illustrating a flawed but intuitive attempt to deconstruct a complex event into simpler, force-based components.
