  art: |
    A civilization's unique signature in the river of time, captured not by its story, but by the physics of its flow, pressure, and memory.
  law: |
    An Epochal State is fully determined by the triplet of its Temporal Coherence (Kτ), Temporal Pressure (Γ), and Dominant Flow State; all other macroscopic civilizational properties are derivative of this state vector.
  philosophy: |
    To classify a civilization by its Epochal State is to reject narrative history in favor of diagnostic physics. It asserts that the "why" of history is found not in intentions or ideologies, but in the measurable dynamics of coherence, pressure, and flow, making history a problem to be solved, not just a story to be told.
pirouette_definition: |
  An Epochal State is the specific, time-dependent vector `(Kτ, Γ, Flow)` that locates a civilization within the 3x3x3 Epochal Manifold. It is composed of three orthogonal, measurable axes: Temporal Coherence (Kτ), which measures adherence to past identity; Temporal Pressure (Γ), which measures environmental stress and complexity; and Dominant Flow State (Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant), which describes the system's internal transport of coherence. This vector serves as a complete, high-level descriptor of a system's health, trajectory, and latent potential for industrial or cultural transformation.

        outline: |
          1. Measure Temporal Coherence (Kτ) by analyzing the rate of decay of cultural/institutional norms against the rate of novel meme/institution adoption.
          2. Measure Temporal Pressure (Γ) by quantifying the rate and complexity of external shocks (e.g., resource scarcity, security threats, technological disruption).
          3. Measure Dominant Flow by analyzing network graphs of capital, information, and goods for markers of efficiency (Laminar), chaotic churn (Turbulent), or blockages (Stagnant).
          4. Combine the three categorical measures into the state vector.

      justification: |
        The Epochal State `(Kτ, Γ, Flow)` functions as a coordinate vector in a macroscopic phase space (the Epochal Manifold). Similar to how a point `(q, p)` in classical phase space defines the complete state of a mechanical system, the Epochal State is posited to define the complete macroscopic state of a civilization, from which its future trajectory can be predicted.

      confidence: 0.8
  adopted:
    - target: State vector in a dynamical system's phase space.
      rationale: The module explicitly frames the Epochal State as a location within the Epochal Manifold, a state space whose axes define the system's dynamics. This directly parallels the concept of a state vector in the phase space of a dynamical system.

    "State" here is not a political state (a nation) but a state in the sense of physics or systems theory—a complete description of a system at an instant. "Epochal" emphasizes that these states are long-lived and define historical eras, not momentary conditions.

# Epochal State

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An Epochal State is the specific, time-dependent vector `(Kτ, Γ, Flow)` that locates a civilization within the 3x3x3 Epochal Manifold. It is composed of three orthogonal, measurable axes: Temporal Coherence (Kτ), which measures adherence to past identity; Temporal Pressure (Γ), which measures environmental stress and complexity; and Dominant Flow State (Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant), which describes the system's internal transport of coherence. This vector serves as a complete, high-level descriptor of a system's health, trajectory, and latent potential for industrial or cultural transformation.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, the Epochal State is the analog of a state vector in a dynamical system's phase space. It posits that the entire macroscopic condition of a complex social system can be specified by coordinates on three axes: internal coherence (Kτ), external pressure (Γ), and the resulting internal dynamics (Flow). This state vector's evolution is governed by a variational principle, akin to the Principle of Stationary Action in classical mechanics, suggesting that a civilization's historical trajectory is its path of maximal coherence through the Epochal Manifold.
