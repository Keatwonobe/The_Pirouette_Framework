        Laminar Channels: Regions characterized by high, stable Kτ and low Γ. These are the predictable, "healthy" parts of the stream where information is transmitted with high fidelity.

    The deep, silent current beneath a river's turbulent surface. It is the clear signal carried on a quiet channel, the melody heard distinctly above the noise.
  law: |
    A system is in a Laminar Channel when its measured Coherence (Kτ) is persistently and significantly greater than its Dissonance (Γ), resulting in a Coherence Ratio (CR) that is both high (CR ≫ 1) and stable over a characteristic timescale.
  philosophy: |
    Laminar Channels represent states of maximal informational efficiency, where a system's internal organization has overcome external pressures. They are the desired state for high-fidelity communication and computation, revealing where a system's dynamics are most productively and predictably expressed.
pirouette_definition: |
  A diagnosed information flow state characterized by high and stable Coherence (Kτ) and low Dissonance (Γ). Laminar Channels are regions within a data stream where patterns are predictable and information is transmitted with high fidelity, corresponding to a high and stable Coherence Ratio (CR). They are the empirical signature of a system successfully maximizing its Pirouette Lagrangian.

        outline: |
          1. Apply the Rhythmic Sieve protocol (DOMA-181) to an information stream by segmenting it into temporal windows.
          2. For each window, calculate Coherence (Kτ) and Dissonance (Γ).
          3. Calculate the Coherence Ratio (CR = Kτ/Γ) for each window.
          4. Identify contiguous temporal regions where the CR is high (e.g., > 3σ above the stream's mean CR) and exhibits low variance.

      To understand a river, one does not simply measure its volume. One must listen to its current, distinguish the steady flow from the turbulent eddy, and map the deep, silent channels hidden beneath the surface noise.

      justification: |
        Laminar Channels are operationally defined by a high Coherence Ratio (CR), which is a direct analog of SNR. Kτ measures the strength of the coherent, predictable "signal," while Γ (often proxied by entropy) measures the power of the unpredictable "noise." A Laminar Channel is a high-SNR communication channel.

  disambiguation: |
    While directly inspired by the concept in fluid dynamics, a Laminar Channel in Pirouette refers to the *informational* properties of a stream (predictability, coherence), not the physical movement of a medium. A physically turbulent fluid could, in principle, carry a signal that constitutes a Laminar Channel.

# Laminar Channels

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A diagnosed information flow state characterized by high and stable Coherence (Kτ) and low Dissonance (Γ). Laminar Channels are regions within a data stream where patterns are predictable and information is transmitted with high fidelity, corresponding to a high and stable Coherence Ratio (CR). They are the empirical signature of a system successfully maximizing its Pirouette Lagrangian.

## EFT-First Summary
In a field-theoretic view of information dynamics, a Laminar Channel is a solution where the "signal" field exhibits a stable, low-energy configuration, dominating the "noise" or "thermal" field. Operationally, this corresponds to a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, where the power of the coherent signal (`Kτ`) is substantially greater than the power of the stochastic noise (`Γ`). Such channels represent efficient, low-dissipation pathways for information propagation.
