    The anchor points in a storm, the stable ground upon which a new self can be built. It is the net that catches the acrobat, transforming a deadly fall into a daring leap.
  law: |
    The maximum sustainable Temporal Pressure (Γ_max) a system can endure without catastrophic decoherence is directly proportional to the available Coherence Scaffolding. Increasing scaffolding (Σ_s) raises the hormetic ceiling.
  philosophy: |
    Growth requires risk, but not recklessness. Scaffolding provides the ethical and practical foundation for a challenge, ensuring that a trial is a forge for resilience, not an engine of destruction. It embodies the principle that no system evolves in a vacuum.
pirouette_definition: |
  The set of external, stable, and accessible resources, resonances, and constraints that a system can utilize to maintain a baseline of coherence while under elevated Temporal Pressure (Γ). Coherence Scaffolding functions as a boundary condition within a Crucible, mitigating the risk of decoherence by providing reliable energy, information, or structural support, thereby enabling the system to focus on adaptive innovation rather than mere survival.

        outline: |
          1. Identify the system and the Crucible's pressure profile (Γ).
          2. Enumerate all external resources (e.g., mentors, knowledge bases, tools, financial reserves, stable environmental factors).
          3. For each resource, assess its reliability, accessibility, and relevance to the specific pressure.
          4. Aggregate these factors into a composite score (Σ_s), often normalized relative to the trial's magnitude.
        expected_signals: [Reduced system coherence variance during trial, faster post-trial recovery, higher probability of achieving target adaptation ΔKτ]
        pitfalls: [Overestimating resource reliability ("hollow scaffolding"), mistaking passive resources for active support, failing to account for the cost of accessing the scaffolding]

    excerpt: |
      The design of a Crucible involves calibrating factors across four domains to ensure the pressure is hormetic rather than destructive. Within the Manifold domain, Coherence Scaffolding is a critical factor: it defines what safety nets, resources, and stable resonances (allies, tools) the system can rely on for support. It, along with Feedback Latency and Resource Influx, shapes the environment in which the system must adapt.
  - module: DOMA-100
    excerpt: |
      A productive challenge is not a random assault; it is a precisely sculpted form. A facilitator who applies intense Temporal Pressure (Γ) without ensuring adequate Coherence Scaffolding is not forging resilience, but risking the catastrophic decoherence of the system. The Covenant of the trial rests upon the honest provision of the agreed-upon supports.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Regularization in a model prevents extreme parameter values (overfitting) by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Similarly, Coherence Scaffolding acts as a constraint on the system's state-space search, preventing it from entering catastrophic, decoherent states by providing 'safe' regions and supports.

  adopted:
    - target: Potential Well Boundary Conditions
      rationale: |
        This mapping captures the role of Scaffolding as a structural constraint on the system's dynamics. It is not an active force, but a passive, environmental feature that limits the 'phase space' available for decoherence, ensuring the system's search for a new Ki remains within a safe, bounded region.

  claims:
    - statement: "For a given Temporal Pressure (Γ), increasing the Coherence Scaffolding (Σ_s) for a system undergoing a Crucible will decrease the probability of catastrophic decoherence and increase the probability of successful adaptation (achieving ΔKτ)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A controlled experiment where two matched cohorts undergo the same high-Γ Crucible, one with high scaffolding and one with low scaffolding. If the high-scaffolding group shows an equal or higher rate of decoherence or failure, the claim is falsified."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinct from a system's *internal* coherence (Kτ) or resilience. Scaffolding is an *external* set of supports provisioned for the duration of a specific trial. It may be internalized as a new capacity post-trial, but during the Crucible, it is fundamentally external to the system under test.

# Coherence Scaffolding

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The set of external, stable, and accessible resources, resonances, and constraints that a system can utilize to maintain a baseline of coherence while under elevated Temporal Pressure (Γ). Coherence Scaffolding functions as a boundary condition within a Crucible, mitigating the risk of decoherence by providing reliable energy, information, or structural support, thereby enabling the system to focus on adaptive innovation rather than mere survival.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, Coherence Scaffolding is analogous to defining the boundary conditions of a potential well within which a system evolves. By establishing stable, high-potential 'walls,' the scaffolding constrains the system's state-space exploration during a high-stress trial, preventing it from entering chaotic trajectories that lead to dissolution. It ensures that applied energy is channeled into productive internal reconfiguration rather than system-wide decoherence.
