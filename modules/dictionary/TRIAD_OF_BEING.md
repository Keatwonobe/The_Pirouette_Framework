        A system does not exist *at* a moment; it exists *across* time, maintaining its form through a dynamic and multi-faceted act of presence. Coherence is not a single note; it is a chord.

  art: |
    We sought to define a being and found instead a chord, struck in the resonant chamber of the present moment. Its notes are three: the echo of what it has been, the touch of what it is now, and the whisper of what it might become.
  law: |
    A system's long-term stability is a direct function of the non-zero magnitude of its three coherence components (*K*<sub>p</sub>, *K*<sub>i</sub>, *K*<sub>r</sub>). The collapse of any single component to zero leads to a predictable failure mode: Stagnation, Isolation, or Amnesia.
  philosophy: |
    The Triad reframes existence from a static state into a continuous act of becoming, maintained by a dynamic harmony between memory, presence, and potential. It posits that resilience is not static strength but the skillful practice of temporal balance.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Triad of Being is the core Pirouette principle that a system's Temporal Coherence (**K**_œÑ) is a vector quantity with three orthogonal components: Prospective Coherence (*K*<sub>p</sub>), resonance with the future; Immediate Coherence (*K*<sub>i</sub>), resonance with the present; and Retrospective Coherence (*K*<sub>r</sub>), resonance with the past. System stability and health are defined not by the magnitude of a single coherence value, but by the dynamic, harmonious balance maintained between all three components.

          Measure a system's field of potential by analyzing the state space of its possible futures. Quantify the richness and accessibility of low-resistance forward paths (geodesics).

          Measure the system's real-time information exchange rate and fidelity with its environment via a calibrated probe system. This assesses the clarity of its Observer's Shadow and its capacity for Alchemical Union.

          Trace the system's historical path (Wound Channel) to measure its informational integrity and persistence against entropic decay. This quantifies the inertia of its accumulated identity.

    excerpt: |
      A system does not exist *at* a moment; it exists *across* time, maintaining its form through a dynamic and multi-faceted act of presence. Coherence is not a single note; it is a chord... A stable entity does not merely exist; it simultaneously remembers, acts, and anticipates. This is the Triad of Being.
  - module: DOMA-018
    excerpt: |
      The failure of any single component leads to a specific, diagnosable pathology... Axis Starvation (*K*p ‚Üí 0) leads to Stagnation. Axis Starvation (*K*i ‚Üí 0) leads to Isolation. Axis Starvation (*K*r ‚Üí 0) leads to Amnesia. A meta-stable entity can survive on two notes, but a truly robust system requires the full, resonant harmony of all three.
  - module: DOMA-018
    excerpt: |
      The universal drive to maximize coherence is not just about increasing its total magnitude, but about constantly *orienting* the coherence vector. Forces and actions are the result of a system adjusting its temporal posture‚Äîshifting its balance between past, present, and future‚Äîto find the most harmonious chord available within the pressure of its environment.

# Triad of Being

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Triad of Being is the core Pirouette principle that a system's Temporal Coherence (**K**_œÑ) is a vector quantity with three orthogonal components: Prospective Coherence (*K*<sub>p</sub>), resonance with the future; Immediate Coherence (*K*<sub>i</sub>), resonance with the present; and Retrospective Coherence (*K*<sub>r</sub>), resonance with the past. System stability and health are defined not by the magnitude of a single coherence value, but by the dynamic, harmonious balance maintained between all three components.

## EFT-First Summary
The Triad of Being models system coherence as a vector field **K**_œÑ with three orthogonal components, analogous to a triplet of interacting scalar fields in EFT. The system's dynamics are governed by a Pirouette Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p ~ ¬Ω Œ£ (‚àÇ_Œº**K**_j)¬≤ - V(**K**_œÑ)`, where stability corresponds to a system maintaining a non-zero magnitude in all three field directions against a potential V shaped by environmental pressures.
