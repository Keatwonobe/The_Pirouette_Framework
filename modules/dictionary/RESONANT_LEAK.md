  art: |
    The damping field that quiets the lepton's self-interaction is not perfect; it hums with its own subtle harmonics. The Resonant Leak is the energy that escapes through these harmonic imperfections, a faint but persistent positive echo of an echo.
  law: |
    The Resonant Leak contributes a positive, third-order correction, C₃(α/π)³, to a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment (a_ℓ). The geometric coefficient C₃ is calculable within the framework, and its value must be consistent with that required to bring the theoretical prediction for a_ℓ into asymptotic agreement with experimental measurements.
  philosophy: |
    The Resonant Leak demonstrates that the framework's geometric narrative is not a one-off analogy but a productive, predictive engine. It proves that a mechanism (self-damping) at one scale can source new, higher-order effects at a finer scale, ensuring the model's perturbative series can asymptotically approach reality without ad-hoc additions.
pirouette_definition: |
  The conceptual model for the physical process giving rise to the positive third-order (O(α³)) correction to a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment. It is modeled as a harmonic mode of the second-order self-damping field, representing a small fraction of the field's energy "leaking" back into the lepton's self-interaction pathway, thereby increasing its effective magnetic moment. This leak generates the universal coefficient C₃ in the Pirouette expansion of a_ℓ.

          The value of C₃ is inferred by fitting the full Pirouette prediction for a_ℓ (including universal terms up to N=3 and other contributions like the Pressuron portal) to high-precision experimental measurements of the electron and muon g-2. This inferred value is then compared to the value calculated directly from the framework's geometric model of the leak.

      We have established that the electron's anomalous magnetic moment arises from a geometric dialogue with its own past. The first echo gave us the α/2π term. This module pushes deeper, into the subtle harmonics of that echo... we will show that the negative second-order correction arises from a "self-damping" effect, and that a positive third-order correction emerges from a "resonant leak" in that same damping field.

      The consistency of the signs and the asymptotic convergence of the magnitudes are powerful evidence that the geometry of coherence is not just a beautiful idea, but a true map of reality. The path forward is clear: continue to refine the calculation.

# Resonant Leak

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The conceptual model for the physical process giving rise to the positive third-order (O(α³)) correction to a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment. It is modeled as a harmonic mode of the second-order self-damping field, representing a small fraction of the field's energy "leaking" back into the lepton's self-interaction pathway, thereby increasing its effective magnetic moment. This leak generates the universal coefficient C₃ in the Pirouette expansion of a_ℓ.

## EFT-First Summary
The Resonant Leak is the Pirouette Framework's proposed geometric origin for the net positive third-order (`O(α³)`), three-loop QED correction to the lepton anomalous magnetic moment (`a_l`). It provides a conceptual and calculational alternative to the summation of hundreds of complex Feynman diagrams, aiming to derive the coefficient `C₃` from a more fundamental principle related to harmonics in a self-interaction field. This single mechanism is conjectured to reproduce the net effect of the diagrams computed in standard Quantum Electrodynamics.
