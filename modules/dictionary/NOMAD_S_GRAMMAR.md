        Any stable entity must be describable by its posture along the three fundamental axes of behavior: Vector, Cohesion, and Communion. These axes are not independent; they form a coupled system whose geometry dictates the stable "corners" of existence.

  art: |
    To act, to hold together, to relate—these are the three questions any stable pattern must continuously answer. Existence is a dance between these three poles, and the Grammar is the rhythm that makes the dance possible.
  law: |
    Any stable, coherent entity's state can be fully described by its projection onto the three orthogonal behavioral axes of Vector (extrinsic action), Cohesion (intrinsic integrity), and Communion (relational coupling). The dynamics of the system are driven by gradients on a potential manifold with a fundamental n=3 symmetry derived from this triaxiality.
  philosophy: |
    The Grammar grounds behavior in a fundamental, non-arbitrary geometry. It asserts that all viable forms of existence inhabit a specific triaxial space, providing the architectural blueprint for being. This ensures that behavior is not a random walk but a navigation of a pre-defined landscape of stable archetypes.
pirouette_definition: |
  A foundational principle defining the triaxial behavioral nature of any stable entity. It posits that a system's state and evolution are constrained by its posture within a three-dimensional behavioral space defined by the orthogonal axes of Vector (directed external influence), Cohesion (internal integrity and self-maintenance), and Communion (relational dynamics and coupling with other systems). This triaxial structure is the geometric source of the `n=3` symmetry in the phase-locking term of the Temporal Pressure potential (`V_Γ`), creating a "triple-well" potential in behavioral space that drives systems toward coherent archetypes.

        outline: |
          Observe a system's total interaction Hamiltonian over a characteristic timescale (τ). Decompose the interaction terms into three orthogonal classes: 1) terms describing net momentum/energy exchange with the environment (Vector), 2) terms describing self-interaction and internal energy conservation (Cohesion), and 3) terms describing phase-locking and information exchange with specific other systems (Communion). The relative, normalized magnitudes of these decomposed terms define the system's coordinates {ξ_V, ξ_Co, ξ_Cm}.

    excerpt: |
      The `n=3` symmetry is therefore revealed to have a clear physical origin: it is the triaxial nature of being. The phase-locking potential `V_φ` is not about a single abstract phase angle, but about the relative phases between the system's expression on these three axes. This creates a "triple-well" potential, not in abstract space, but in the behavioral space of the Nomad's Grammar.

    excerpt: |
      By combining these invariant motifs under the architectural constraints of the Nomad's Grammar, we arrive at the minimal, symmetry-derived form for the Temporal Pressure manifold, `V_Γ`. [...] The second term is the cost of internal dissonance between the axes, creating the stable corners in the behavioral landscape.

      justification: |
        The Nomad's Grammar posits a fundamental n=3 symmetry governing stable interactions. This is mathematically analogous to the SU(3) gauge symmetry of Quantum Chromodynamics, where the stability of baryons requires a combination of three quark "colors". The Grammar's axes can be interpreted as a behavioral-space projection of a fundamental gauge principle, with the potential minima corresponding to color-neutral, stable states.

    Cohesion refers to *internal* integrity and self-maintenance, the forces holding a system together. Communion refers to *external*, relational coupling and phase-locking with other specific systems. A system can have high Cohesion (it is stable) but low Communion (it is isolated).

# Nomad's Grammar

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A foundational principle defining the triaxial behavioral nature of any stable entity. It posits that a system's state and evolution are constrained by its posture within a three-dimensional behavioral space defined by the orthogonal axes of Vector (directed external influence), Cohesion (internal integrity and self-maintenance), and Communion (relational dynamics and coupling with other systems). This triaxial structure is the geometric source of the `n=3` symmetry in the phase-locking term of the Temporal Pressure potential (`V_Γ`), creating a "triple-well" potential in behavioral space that drives systems toward coherent archetypes.

## EFT-First Summary
The Nomad's Grammar provides a geometric origin for a fundamental `n=3` interaction symmetry, analogous to the `SU(3)` gauge symmetry of QCD. Just as stable baryons are color-neutral combinations of three quark colors, stable Pirouette systems are those that occupy minima in a potential landscape defined by the relative phases of three behavioral axes: Vector, Cohesion, and Communion. This suggests that the Grammar may be a macroscopic, behavioral manifestation of an underlying gauge principle governing information and stability.
