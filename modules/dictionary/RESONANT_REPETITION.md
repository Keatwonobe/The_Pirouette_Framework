triad:
  art: |
    Practice is the art of choosing which paths to deepen into highways. Each repetition is a chisel stroke, carving the person we intend to become into the fabric of our being.
  law: |
    The change in a Wound Channel's depth—measured as the reduction in Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) for the associated action—is proportional to the number and quality of repetitions. The quality of each repetition is a direct function of the practitioner's Temporal Coherence (Kτ) during the act.
  philosophy: |
    This term reframes practice from a brute-force effort into an act of geometric self-sculpting. It asserts that agents have direct agency over their own internal landscape, using the fundamental tools of attention and repetition to make desired skills not just possible, but the most natural paths of action.
pirouette_definition: |
  The physical process by which an agent deliberately deepens a Wound Channel within their coherence manifold. Each repetition, when executed with high Temporal Coherence (focused attention), acts as a sculpting event that incrementally reduces the Temporal Pressure associated with a skill path. It is the primary mechanism for transforming a high-effort, turbulent action into a low-effort, laminar flow state.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline for a target skill by measuring performance metrics (e.g., completion time, error rate, cognitive load via biometrics). This quantifies the initial Temporal Pressure (V_Γ).
          2. Execute a pre-defined number (N_ℛ) of practice repetitions under conditions of high focus (measured Kτ) and optimal challenge.
          3. Re-measure the performance metrics under the same conditions as the baseline.
          4. The change in performance (ΔV_Γ) is attributed to the effect of the N_ℛ repetitions.
        expected_signals: [Decreased task completion time, lower error rate, reduced biometric stress indicators, increased subjective report of "flow".]
        pitfalls: [Conflating mindless repetition with focused, resonant repetition; failure to control for fatigue or motivation; poor feedback loops leading to the reinforcement of incorrect channels.]

    excerpt: |
      Resonant Repetition is the Chisel's Stroke: Each focused repetition is a pass of the chisel, deepening the desired Wound Channel. It is the physical act that impresses a new geometry upon the manifold. Repetition without focus is noise; it does not carve, it merely scuffs the surface. The quality of the repetition—its alignment with an ideal form—determines the precision of the cut.

        Resonant Repetition is a macroscopic description of repeated, coherent neural activation strengthening synaptic pathways. The "deepening" of a Wound Channel is a direct geometric analog to the increase in synaptic efficacy (LTP) described by Hebb's rule ("neurons that fire together, wire together"), which is the dominant biological mechanism for skill acquisition.

  disambiguation: |
    "Resonant Repetition" is distinct from "rote repetition" or "grinding." The "Resonant" qualifier is critical, implying the act is performed with high Temporal Coherence (focus) and within a state of optimal challenge. Repetition without these qualities is considered noise that "scuffs the surface" rather than carving a channel.

# Resonant Repetition

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The physical process by which an agent deliberately deepens a Wound Channel within their coherence manifold. Each repetition, when executed with high Temporal Coherence (focused attention), acts as a sculpting event that incrementally reduces the Temporal Pressure associated with a skill path. It is the primary mechanism for transforming a high-effort, turbulent action into a low-effort, laminar flow state.

## EFT-First Summary
Resonant Repetition is the Pirouette Framework's operational analog to Hebbian learning and Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) in neuroscience. Just as repeated, correlated firing of neurons strengthens their synaptic connections, each focused repetition of an action strengthens a "skill pathway" or Wound Channel. This process geometrically reshapes the agent's internal landscape of possibilities, making the practiced skill more probable and efficient by lowering its execution cost, analogous to increasing synaptic efficacy along a specific neural circuit.
