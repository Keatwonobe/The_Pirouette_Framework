  law: |
    An Individual Truth (Kτ) is a self-consistent, bounded argument that must be presented in its entirety without interruption and formally acknowledge its foundational assumptions (Observer's Shadow, Ω) before it can be integrated into a Resonant Synthesis Protocol.
  philosophy: |
    Kτ establishes the individual's perspective as a sacred, necessary, but incomplete component of a larger truth. It reframes a personal viewpoint not as a territory to be defended, but as a unique contribution offered for collaborative integration, thereby making synthesis possible.
pirouette_definition: |
  An Individual Truth, Kτ, is the initial, self-consistent model, argument, or perspective contributed by a participant (a "Weaver") at the start of a Resonant Synthesis Protocol. It serves as the foundational element or "thread" which, when combined with others under the protocol's rules, is intended to be woven into a more comprehensive, shared understanding (Resonant Synthesis, Kτ_c). A valid Kτ is necessarily coupled with an acknowledgment of the Weaver's Observer's Shadow (Ω).

        outline: |
          A Kτ is assessed not for its objective correctness, but for its internal coherence and completeness as a starting point. A moderator or the group applies two tests:
          1. **Coherence Check:** The Weaver articulates the core claim, supporting logic, and foundational assumptions (the declared Ω). The argument must be free of self-contradiction.
          2. **Boundary Check:** The Weaver defines the scope of their Kτ—what it purports to explain and what it does not. The presentation must be deliverable as a single, uninterrupted "thread" as per the protocol.

        An Individual Truth (Kτ) functions as a Bayesian Prior: an initial belief, model, or hypothesis (H) brought to the discourse before new evidence (E) is considered. The Resonant Synthesis Protocol is the process of updating this prior in light of other priors and shared evidence to arrive at a posterior, shared understanding (Kτ_c).

  disambiguation: |
    Individual Truth (Kτ) is distinct from objective truth. It is a starting *perspective*, not a final state of reality. It is also the input to the process, not the output, which is the collaborative Resonant Synthesis (Kτ_c).

# Individual Truth

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An Individual Truth, Kτ, is the initial, self-consistent model, argument, or perspective contributed by a participant (a "Weaver") at the start of a Resonant Synthesis Protocol. It serves as the foundational element or "thread" which, when combined with others under the protocol's rules, is intended to be woven into a more comprehensive, shared understanding (Resonant Synthesis, Kτ_c). A valid Kτ is necessarily coupled with an acknowledgment of the Weaver's Observer's Shadow (Ω).

## EFT-First Summary
An Individual Truth (Kτ) can be modeled as a Bayesian Prior—an initial, coherent hypothesis brought into a system of inference. The discourse process serves to update this prior based on evidence presented by other Weavers, aiming for a shared posterior understanding. It represents the starting point of belief before collaborative evidence is weighed.
