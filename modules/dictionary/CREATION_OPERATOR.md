        **Generators**: creation operators (C^+_P) that add a new event with parent set (P \subseteq \text{Max}(E)) (maximal existing events).

  art: |
    The universe whispers a new word into existence, spun from the threads of its most recent moments. Each application of the operator is a singular, irreversible birth on the causal frontier.
  law: |
    Given a fabric E, the operator C⁺_P generates a new event v such that its direct predecessors are exactly the set of maximal events P ⊆ Max(E). The probability of this operation is proportional to exp(-ΔS(E;P)), where S is the action functional.
  philosophy: |
    The operator enforces that all creation is contingent on what already exists (P), local (P are maximal), and fundamentally stochastic. It is the primitive action by which spacetime knits itself, replacing a smooth, continuous 'unfolding' with a discrete, computational 'accretion'.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Creation Operator, C⁺_P, is the fundamental generator of the free monoid of growth. It acts on a fabric (a locally finite poset E) to produce a new fabric E' = E ∪ {v} where the new event v is defined by the causal relation {u | u ≺ v} = P ∪ {q | ∃p ∈ P, q ≺ p}. The operator is only defined if P is a non-empty subset of the maximal elements of E, Max(E), and the resulting fabric E' remains acyclic. Its application is governed by the ensemble law, ℙ(C⁺_P|E) ∝ exp(-ΔS).

      - name: Event History Reconstruction
        outline: |
          The operator is not directly measured but its effects are inferred. Given a final fabric E, one can reconstruct possible histories of C⁺_P applications by iteratively removing maximal elements. The probability of any specific history is determined by the product of exp(-ΔS) factors at each step. By analyzing the statistical distribution of motifs in a large fabric, one can infer the relative frequencies of different C⁺_P applications and thus constrain the form of the action S.
        expected_signals: [Statistical over-representation of motifs corresponding to low-ΔS creation events, Correlation patterns consistent with the locality relation C⁺_P C⁺_Q = C⁺_Q C⁺_P for spacelike separated P and Q]
        pitfalls: [History reconstruction is non-unique; many growth paths can lead to the same final fabric, Inference of S is an inverse problem and can be ill-posed without sufficient data or prior constraints on S.]

      **Generators**: creation operators (C^+_P) that add a new event with parent set (P \subseteq \text{Max}(E)) (maximal existing events).
      **Relations** (locality & acyclicity): (C^+_P C^+_Q = C^+_Q C^+_P) if (P\cup Q) are mutually incomparable (far apart). Any sequence that would create a cycle is **undefined**.
      **Words**: finite sequences of (C^+_P) acting on (\varnothing) build all finite fabrics.

      **Ensemble law**: the probability to append a new event with parents (P) is
      [
      \mathbb{P}(C^+_P|E) \propto \exp!\big(-\Delta S(E;P)\big).

      This is the substrate analogue of a path integral: *histories of becoming weighted by action increments*.

      justification: |
        Like the QFT creation operator a†, C⁺_P adds a fundamental excitation (an 'event') to the state (the 'fabric'). However, C⁺_P acts on the spacetime substrate itself, not on a pre-existing spacetime, and its 'label' P is a dynamic set of parents rather than a fixed mode k.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from QFT creation operators (e.g., a†), which add excitations (particles) to a fixed background state or Fock space. C⁺_P modifies the background (the fabric) itself, creating a new event upon which future events can be built.
