    The ratio of the bass string's tension to the melody string's; it sets the instrument's fundamental harmony and how it responds to being played. It is the tuning constant for spacetime's electroweak chord.
  law: |
    The ratio of triad stiffness to clock stiffness, ρ_stiff = K₂/K₁ = g'²/g², concurrently determines the electroweak mixing angle at the coherence scale (sin²θ_W = 1 / (1 + ρ_stiff)) and the relative contribution of the SU(2) and U(1) frames to the Higgs potential's bare quadratic term (α₀ ∝ K₁⁻¹ + K₂⁻¹).
  philosophy: |
    The existence of a single, shared stiffness ratio for both electroweak mixing and Higgs potential curvature is a primary assertion of the triad–clock alignment mechanism. It posits that gauge boson masses and the Higgs vev are not independent phenomena but are co-determined by the underlying frame dynamics, reducing the arbitrariness of the Standard Model.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Stiffness Ratio, ρ_stiff, is the dimensionless ratio of the SU(2)_L triad stiffness (K₂) to the U(1)_Y clock stiffness (K₁). It quantifies the relative resistance of the two temporal frames to misalignment. This ratio directly sets the weak mixing angle, sin²θ_W = (1 + ρ_stiff)⁻¹, and constrains the shape of the Higgs potential by governing the bare quadratic term, α₀, which represents the energy cost of triad-clock misalignment before temporal pressure softening.

          3. Calculate ρ_stiff at μ_c using the relation ρ_stiff = cot²θ_W.
          4. Independently measure the Higgs trilinear coupling (λ₃) via di-Higgs production (e.g., at HL-LHC or a future collider).
          5. Test if the value of ρ_stiff from step 3 provides a consistent fit to the Higgs potential shape as constrained by λ₃.

      justification: |
        In Pirouette, gauge couplings g and g' are interpreted as inverse frame stiffnesses. Therefore, the ratio ρ_stiff = K₂/K₁ is mathematically equivalent to the ratio g'²/g², which is identical to tan²θ_W in the Standard Model. This provides a direct, falsifiable link between the framework's dynamics and a precision observable.

# Stiffness Ratio

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Stiffness Ratio, ρ_stiff, is the dimensionless ratio of the SU(2)_L triad stiffness (K₂) to the U(1)_Y clock stiffness (K₁). It quantifies the relative resistance of the two temporal frames to misalignment. This ratio directly sets the weak mixing angle, sin²θ_W = (1 + ρ_stiff)⁻¹, and constrains the shape of the Higgs potential by governing the bare quadratic term, α₀, which represents the energy cost of triad-clock misalignment before temporal pressure softening.

## EFT-First Summary
The Stiffness Ratio ρ_stiff is the Pirouette framework's dynamical origin for the Standard Model quantity tan²θ_W = g'²/g², where θ_W is the weak mixing angle. It is interpreted not just as a ratio of couplings, but as the fundamental ratio of the 'stiffness' of the SU(2)_L and U(1)_Y gauge frames. The framework claims this single ratio simultaneously governs electroweak mixing and constrains the curvature of the Higgs potential, providing a testable link between precision Z-pole physics and future di-Higgs measurements.
