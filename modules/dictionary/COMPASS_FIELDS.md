    The universe's flow provides a local north, splitting the raw potential of coherence into a directed force and a swirling vortex. This act of observation turns an abstract curvature into a tangible compass pointing along the observer's worldline.
  law: |
    Relative to any timelike observer with 4-velocity u^Œº, the coherence curvature 2-form F_{ŒºŒΩ} uniquely splits into an electric-like vector E_Œº and a magnetic-like pseudovector B_Œº. Both fields are purely spatial with respect to the observer (E_Œº u^Œº = 0, B_Œº u^Œº = 0).
  philosophy: |
    This decomposition is the essential bridge from abstract gauge geometry to operational physics. It grounds the invariant curvature F_{ŒºŒΩ} in the contingent, observer-dependent reality of forces and torques, making the framework's predictions locally measurable and intuitive.

They are defined by the contractions E_Œº = F_{ŒºŒΩ}u^ŒΩ and B_Œº = ‚ãÜF_{ŒºŒΩ}u^ŒΩ, where ‚ãÜ is the Hodge dual. By construction, both fields are spacelike and orthogonal to the observer's velocity.

        outline: |
          Measure the precession or acceleration of a test spinor coupled to the coherence field. The equation of motion, involving the term œÉ^{ŒºŒΩ}F_{ŒºŒΩ}, can be decomposed into E- and B-like couplings in the spinor's rest frame. By measuring spin precession (related to B_Œº) and Stark-like level shifts or acceleration (related to E_Œº), one can reconstruct the local Compass Field components.

    excerpt: |
      The calculation of the electron EDM `d_e` requires evaluating the interaction `œàÃÑ iœÉ^{ŒºŒΩ}Œ≥_5 œà F_{ŒºŒΩ}`. In the rest frame of the electron, where `u^Œº = (1, 0, 0, 0)`, this simplifies significantly. The interaction can be expressed in terms of the Compass Fields as `d_e (B ¬∑ œÉ - i E ¬∑ Œ≥_5 œÉ)`, cleanly separating the magnetic and electric-like contributions to the CP-violating energy shift.

        The Pirouette definition is a direct adoption of the standard 3+1 ("threading") decomposition of any 2-form tensor relative to a timelike observer 4-velocity u^Œº.

The Compass Fields are simply this construct applied to the coherence curvature F_{ŒºŒΩ} rather than the electromagnetic Faraday tensor.

  disambiguation: |
    The symbols E_Œº and B_Œº are chosen to be deliberately analogous to their counterparts in electromagnetism. In contexts where both the coherence field and EM field are present, they must be distinguished, e.g., E_Œº^{(coh)} and E_Œº^{(EM)}. The 'Compass' name emphasizes their role in providing a local orientation relative to the coherence fluid, rather than being fundamental fields themselves.

# Compass Fields

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Compass Fields are the electric-like vector field E_Œº and the magnetic-like pseudovector field B_Œº that result from the decomposition of the coherence curvature 2-form F_{ŒºŒΩ} with respect to a local fluid frame's 4-velocity u^Œº. They are defined by the contractions E_Œº = F_{ŒºŒΩ}u^ŒΩ and B_Œº = ‚ãÜF_{ŒºŒΩ}u^ŒΩ, where ‚ãÜ is the Hodge dual. By construction, both fields are spacelike and orthogonal to the observer's velocity.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of general relativity and field theory, the Compass Fields are the standard observer-dependent electric and magnetic parts of a generalized U(1) field strength tensor `F_{ŒºŒΩ}`. This 3+1 decomposition, defined by `E_Œº = F_{ŒºŒΩ}u^ŒΩ` and `B_Œº = ‚ãÜF_{ŒºŒΩ}u^ŒΩ` with respect to a local fluid 4-velocity `u^Œº`, is a standard technique for isolating the physical force components experienced by an observer moving with the fluid. This formalism is identical to that used for the electromagnetic field in curved spacetime (cf. Wald, 1984).
