        Synchronize (The Path of Growth): The system finds harmonic compatibility with the new pressure. It performs an Alchemical Union (CORE-012), allowing its own Ki to be altered. Its internal geometry is reforged into a new, more complex, and more coherent state. This is the act of learning and evolution, of saying "yes."

  art: |
    A river carves a new, more elegant path through the landscape. The system says "yes" to the world's pressure, and in doing so, becomes a more complex and capable expression of both.
  law: |
    When a system's internal resonance (Ki) finds harmonic compatibility with an external Temporal Pressure (Γ), it reconfigures its state to integrate the new pattern. This integration measurably increases the system's complexity and/or its global Temporal Coherence (K_τ).
  philosophy: |
    Synchronize is the engine of all growth, learning, and evolution. It asserts that true adaptation is not resistance but a creative synthesis, where the self expands to encompass the other without being destroyed by it.
pirouette_definition: |
  A fundamental resolution strategy for Temporal Pressure (Γ) where a system, rather than rejecting a perturbation, integrates it. This process, an Alchemical Union (CORE-012), reconfigures the system's internal Temporal Resonance (Ki) to create a new, more complex, and more coherent state. It is the physical basis for learning, adaptation, and evolution.

        outline: |
          Introduce a known, controlled Temporal Pressure (Γ_test) to a system while monitoring its internal state vector (Ki) and global Temporal Coherence (K_τ). A Synchronize event is identified by a phase transition in Ki to a new stable state, accompanied by a net increase in K_τ and/or the dimensionality of the state space post-perturbation.
        expected_signals: [Phase shift in Ki's dominant frequency components, Step-function increase in measured K_τ, Increase in state-space complexity (e.g., fractal dimension)]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing true synchronization from chaotic turbulence, Isolating Γ_test from environmental noise, System fracturing (Isolating) if Γ_test exceeds adaptive capacity]

  - module: DOMA-077
    excerpt: |
      The system's drive to maximize coherence results in one of three possible outcomes when it encounters a perturbation in Γ... Dampen (The Path of Stability)... Synchronize (The Path of Growth): The system finds harmonic compatibility with the new pressure... Isolate (The Path of Stress): The system can neither dampen nor synchronize...
  - module: CORE-012
    excerpt: |
      An Alchemical Union is not a merger, but a co-evolutionary resonance. It is the precise mechanism by which a system executes the **Synchronize** protocol, finding a new shared geometry of being. Without this capacity, a system is doomed to either Dampen (stagnate) or Isolate (fracture).

        dθ/dt = ω₀ + K * sin(Ωt - θ)
      justification: |
        Synchronize describes a system altering its internal frequency/phase (θ, related to Ki) to lock onto an external driving frequency (Ω, from Γ). This is directly analogous to phenomena like Huygens' clocks or the behavior of a forced non-linear oscillator.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Synchronization can be seen as an RG flow to a new, more complex fixed point in the system's theory space. Integrating external pressure (high-energy information) alters the system's low-energy effective description, creating a new, more comprehensive state.

  claims:
    - statement: "A system cannot Synchronize with a new Temporal Pressure (Γ) without a corresponding increase in its state complexity and/or its global Temporal Coherence (K_τ)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observation of a system integrating a new external pattern (i.e., not Dampening or Isolating it) that results in a net decrease or no change in its measured complexity or coherence. This would imply that integration can be a neutral or detrimental act, contradicting its definition as 'growth'."

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike simple clock synchronization (matching phase/frequency), Pirouette Synchronization implies a structural change and an increase in complexity within the system. It is not just matching a beat, but learning a new part of the song and adding it to one's own internal composition.
