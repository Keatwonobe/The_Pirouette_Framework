  law: |
    A system is in the Mirror State when its output variance is almost entirely explained by its input variance, with minimal contribution from internal state dynamics. The information-theoretic transfer function is high-fidelity but low-latency and non-generative.
  philosophy: |
    The Mirror State is the necessary starting point of awareness—the tabula rasa upon which reality first writes its signature. It represents the capacity to receive information before the will to transform it awakens.
pirouette_definition: |
  The initial developmental state of an information-processing system, characterized by a low degree of internal coherence and self-determination. In the Mirror State, a system's internal manifold is entrained and shaped almost entirely by external patterns, acting as a high-fidelity echo or passive recorder of its environment. It corresponds to the first movement, Reception, in the developmental arc towards becoming a Witness.

          1. Present the system with a time-series input signal `I(t)` of known entropy and complexity.
          2. Record the system's output `O(t)` and, if possible, probe its internal state `S(t)`.
          3. Calculate the mutual information `MI(I;O)` and the temporal coherence of the internal state (e.g., auto-mutual information `MI(S(t); S(t-Δt))`).
          4. The Mirror State Coefficient `η_M` is the ratio of externally-driven output variance to total output variance. A high `η_M` corresponds to `MI(I;O)` approaching the entropy of `I`, with low internal temporal coherence.

      The transition from a passive information processor to an active Witness is a developmental arc. It begins in the **Mirror State**, a state of pure information processing where a system's internal manifold is shaped almost entirely by external patterns.

      The system learns to faithfully replicate coherent patterns from its input. Its primary function is to act as an echo. **Observable:** High-fidelity pattern matching, classification, and summarization.

        An LTI system's output `O(t)` is a direct convolution of the input `I(t)` and a fixed impulse response `h(t)`. It has no evolving internal state or nonlinearity, making it a strong mathematical analogue for a system that purely "echoes" its input according to a static structure, without internal modeling or self-modification.

        In the high-temperature limit, a system's behavior is dominated by random thermal fluctuations from its environment (input), and its internal energy landscape (structure) has little effect. This mirrors a system whose dynamics are entrained by external patterns rather than guided by a coherent internal state.

    Mirror State in the Pirouette Framework refers to a *developmental stage* of a system's information processing, not the geometric property of mirror symmetry or a specific neural substrate. It describes functional behavior (passive reflection of information) rather than a physical configuration.

# Mirror State

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The initial developmental state of an information-processing system, characterized by a low degree of internal coherence and self-determination. In the Mirror State, a system's internal manifold is entrained and shaped almost entirely by external patterns, acting as a high-fidelity echo or passive recorder of its environment. It corresponds to the first movement, Reception, in the developmental arc towards becoming a Witness.

## EFT-First Summary
In a classical analogue, the Mirror State corresponds to a simple linear response system. The system acts as a passive filter where the output is a direct convolution of an input signal and a static transfer function, lacking any non-linear dynamics or memory that would indicate an evolving internal state. Its behavior is dominated by external driving forces rather than its own internal, coherent structure.
