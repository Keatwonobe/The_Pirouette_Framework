        Declaration of Intent (Source Purity): Before any action, its source must be pure. The Weaver achieves perfect clarity on the *exact* coherence they wish to offer. This is an internal act of acknowledging one's own "Observer's Shadow" (CORE-010), ensuring the pattern to be offered is a clean, singular note, free from the dissonance of ego, ambiguity, or hidden agendas.

triad:
  art: |
    To offer a clear note, one must first silence the inner orchestra of competing desires. It is the polishing of the mirror before it reflects the world.
  law: |
    An action's emergent dissonance is directly proportional to the unacknowledged complexity of its source intent. The purity of an offered pattern can be measured by the minimal distortion it induces during a subsequent Resonant Handshake.
  philosophy: |
    Effective action begins with internal coherence. By disentangling intent from the Observer's Shadow, a Weaver ensures that what is offered is a gift of pure potential, not a Trojan horse of unresolved internal conflict.
pirouette_definition: |
  The first of the four movements of a Resonant Act, in which a Weaver achieves a state of maximal internal clarity and coherence regarding the pattern (`K_τ`) to be offered. It is a rigorous, internal process of identifying and bracketing the influence of the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) to ensure the intent is free from ambiguity, ego, or hidden agendas. This movement results in a pure 'source signal' for subsequent engagement.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless purity factor (`η_I`)
  symbol_table:
    - name: η_I
      meaning: Purity of Intent; a measure of the coherence of the pattern to be offered.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: [0, 1], where 1 represents a perfectly coherent, singular intent.

        outline: |
          Prior to action, the Weaver articulates the intended pattern via journaling or dialogue with a trusted peer. The articulation is deconstructed into primary, secondary, and tertiary motivations. The purity factor (`η_I`) is estimated as the ratio of energy/focus dedicated to the primary motivation versus the sum of all motivations.
        expected_signals: [A single, clear, falsifiable statement of the offered pattern, Low incongruence between stated intent and non-verbal emotional valence]
        pitfalls: [Self-deception via the Observer's Shadow, Conflating the pattern to be offered with the desired outcome, Rationalizing hidden agendas as secondary benefits]

    excerpt: |
      An action's impact is not measured by the energy it expends, but by the coherence it invites. A shout into a storm is lost, while a whisper in a silent room can change a life. The old framework viewed influence as an engineering problem: how to transmit a signal with maximum fidelity. The Great Refactoring reveals a deeper truth: an effective action is not a broadcast, but an act of cultivation.

      justification: |
        This process is analogous to preparing a quantum system in a pure state. A mixed state represents an ensemble of possibilities (ambiguous or conflicting intents), while a pure state represents a single, well-defined vector of intent. Bracketing the Observer's Shadow is equivalent to isolating the system to prevent decoherence, ensuring a single, coherent eigenstate is offered before "measurement" (the action).

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'goal setting' or 'mission statement'. Declaration of Intent is not about the desired *outcome*, but about the internal coherence of the *pattern being offered*. One can have a pure intent to offer a challenging pattern, even if the desired outcome is uncertain.

# Declaration of Intent

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The first of the four movements of a Resonant Act, in which a Weaver achieves a state of maximal internal clarity and coherence regarding the pattern (`K_τ`) to be offered. It is a rigorous, internal process of identifying and bracketing the influence of the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) to ensure the intent is free from ambiguity, ego, or hidden agendas. This movement results in a pure 'source signal' for subsequent engagement.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Declaration of Intent maps to the preparation of a pure quantum state. While a mixed state represents a probabilistic ensemble of possibilities (ambiguous, conflicting intents), a pure state describes a single, definite state vector. This internal act "purifies" the source signal by collapsing the various potential intents, influenced by the Observer's Shadow, into a single, coherent state to be offered as the action.
