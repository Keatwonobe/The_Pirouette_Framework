  art: |
    A choice that becomes a scar, a lightning strike's path forever etched into the sky. Each commitment is a note played that becomes a permanent part of the instrument. The dance of becoming is frozen into the form of being.
  law: |
    A system's internal time advances only through discrete, non-reversible events that permanently alter its boundary conditions. The history of these events is materially identical to the system's final form.
  philosophy: |
    The past is not a passive record but an active, physical geometry that shapes the present. Consequence is not an abstract outcome but a structural reality; we grow the world with every choice from which there is no return.
pirouette_definition: |
  A discrete, non-reversible event in which a unit of chaotic potential (from a field of high Temporal Pressure, Γ) is permanently bound to a coherent structure (Ki), advancing the system's internal time by one quantum. Each commitment permanently alters the system's geometry and sets the boundary conditions for all subsequent commitments, creating a physical history of its own growth. It is the fundamental mechanism by which systems trace a Growth Geodesic.

    excerpt: |
      For this system, the fundamental unit of time—its "heartbeat"—is not a repeating oscillation, but a single, irreversible event: the "kiss" of a particle attaching to the cluster. With each attachment, the system's clock advances one tick. This is an act of **irreversible temporal commitment** that permanently alters the system's Ki, extending its Wound Channel and creating a new boundary for all subsequent events. The growth *is* the system's time.

    excerpt: |
      Growth is a song where each note, once played, becomes a permanent part of the instrument. The shape of a snowflake is the memory of a million resonant choices, a frozen record of a dance between chaos and coherence. The past is not a story we tell; it is the physical, active geometry that shapes the present. For a Weaver, this is the ultimate lesson in consequence.

      rationale: The DLA model is the archetypal system described in DOMA-103. Each time a simulated particle adheres to the growing cluster, it is a perfect, minimalist operationalization of a single Irreversible Temporal Commitment: it is discrete, it is (by rule) irreversible, it permanently alters the cluster's shape, and it determines where future particles are most likely to attach.

      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Demonstrate a system that produces DLA-like fractal structures but whose final form is independent of its growth path (i.e., path-independent). Alternatively, show that the fundamental attachment events in a real DLA-like system (e.g., electrodeposition) are substantially reversible, with particles detaching and reattaching frequently, indicating the 'commitment' is not permanent."

  disambiguation: |
    This is not just any "event" or "state change". An Irreversible Temporal Commitment is distinct in that it must be:
    1.  **Irreversible:** The change cannot be undone under typical system conditions.
    2.  **Temporal:** It is the fundamental unit that advances the system's own internal clock.
    3.  **Formative:** It permanently alters the system's geometry (Ki) and thereby changes the probability landscape for all future events.

# Irreversible Temporal Commitment

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An Irreversible Temporal Commitment is a discrete, non-reversible event in which a unit of chaotic potential (from a field of high Temporal Pressure, Γ) is permanently bound to a coherent structure (Ki), advancing the system's internal time by one quantum. Each commitment permanently alters the system's geometry and sets the boundary conditions for all subsequent commitments, creating a physical history of its own growth. It is the fundamental mechanism by which systems trace a Growth Geodesic.

## EFT-First Summary
This term describes a process where a system's background structure is built by irreversibly "freezing out" fluctuating degrees of freedom. Operationally, it is mapped directly to the particle attachment event in Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) models, which are used to describe fractal pattern formation in condensed matter systems. Each commitment is a discrete construction event that adds to the system's physical form, with the cumulative history of these events defining the final, complex geometry.
