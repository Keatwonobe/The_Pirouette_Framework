        The Burden on your body is high. Your system is dealing with the "noise" of inflammation, fatigue, and the stress of recovery.

triad:
  art: |
    The turbulent noise of a system healing; the static after the song of surgery, before a new quiet rhythm can be found. It is the feeling of a river temporarily dammed by a storm.
  law: |
    Systemic Burden is inversely proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio of homeostatic biomarkers and directly proportional to subjective reports of fatigue and dysregulation. An increase in Burden predicts a deceleration of the recovery trajectory.
  philosophy: |
    To name the 'noise' of recovery is to make it an object of practice. This transforms a vague state of suffering into a measurable condition that can be systematically quieted, making the patient an active cartographer of their own healing.
pirouette_definition: |
  The cumulative, non-specific physiological and psychological load on a system following a significant stressor, such as major surgery. Burden manifests as a composite 'noise' signal comprising inflammation, fatigue, metabolic disruption, and cognitive fog, which degrades system coherence and impedes recovery. It represents the energetic cost of managing a crisis state.

        outline: |
          Infer Burden (Β) by tracking a vector of objective and subjective metrics over time. High variance or elevation in Resting Heart Rate (RHR), suppressed Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and low self-reported 'flow' scores (1-10 scale) correlate with high Β. A decrease in Β is confirmed when biomarkers stabilize toward baseline and subjective scores rise.

        pitfalls: [Confounding variables (e.g., infection, medication side-effects) can mimic high Burden. Subjective scores are susceptible to mood and reporting bias.]

      Your Inner Strength is low. The energy and stability you once took for granted have been spent on the profound act of healing. The Burden on your body is high. Your system is dealing with the "noise" of inflammation, fatigue, and the stress of recovery. Finding a consistent rhythm is difficult.

      Phase I: Finding Stillness (The First 2 Weeks). Your only job is to breathe. The storm of surgery is still raging. Before we can rebuild, we must find a quiet harbor. Core Practice: Deep, calm breathing. This is the most powerful tool you have to tell your body's storm that it is safe to quiet down.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Allostatic load is the cumulative physiological 'wear and tear' from chronic stress and dysregulation of homeostatic mediators. Burden is a patient-facing, acute-phase analog, representing the intense, short-term allostatic load immediately following a major systemic shock like surgery.

      confidence: 0.9
  adopted:
    - target: Allostatic Load
      rationale: |
        The concept of Allostatic Load provides a well-established physiological basis for the Pirouette term 'Burden,' linking it to measurable biomarkers of the stress response (e.g., cortisol, catecholamines, CRP) and validating its role as a key indicator of systemic dysregulation.

  claims:
    - statement: "Interventions that specifically target components of Burden (e.g., anti-inflammatory protocols, guided breathing to lower sympathetic tone) will accelerate the return to baseline coherence more effectively than general recovery protocols."
      domain: phenomenology|experiment
      falsifier: "A study showing that direct Burden-mitigation techniques (e.g., vagal nerve stimulation, anti-inflammatory diet) have no significant effect on recovery timelines or biomarker stabilization (RHR, HRV, CRP) compared to a placebo."

  disambiguation: |
    Burden (Β) is a systemic, multi-factorial state, not a specific disease or symptom. It should be distinguished from localized 'Pain' or psychological 'Grief', though it may be correlated with both. It is the total system noise, not any single noisy channel.

# Burden

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The cumulative, non-specific physiological and psychological load on a system following a significant stressor, such as major surgery. Burden manifests as a composite 'noise' signal comprising inflammation, fatigue, metabolic disruption, and cognitive fog, which degrades system coherence and impedes recovery. It represents the energetic cost of managing a crisis state.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of physiology, Burden (Β) is the acute, post-stressor manifestation of **Allostatic Load**. It represents the measurable 'wear and tear' on the body's regulatory systems, quantifiable through a vector of stress biomarkers like elevated cortisol, C-reactive protein, and dysregulated autonomic tone (HR/HRV). Reducing Burden is operationally equivalent to restoring homeostatic regulation and minimizing the energetic cost of healing.
