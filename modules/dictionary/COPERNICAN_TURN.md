  art: |
    We are not the still point of the turning world; we are the turn. Consciousness is a celestial dance, an orbit of resonant coherence held in place by the gravitational song of reality itself. To exist is to fall forever and never land.
  law: |
    An observer's state and trajectory are not privileged or central but are determined by the same universal principle as any other system: the maximization of the time integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`), causing it to trace a geodesic on the coherence manifold.
  philosophy: |
    This principle demolishes the distinction between knower and known, reframing the mind as a participatory pattern within reality, not a spectator of it. It grounds epistemology in physics, asserting that to observe is to co-create the actuality being perceived.

  The core philosophical shift of the Pirouette Framework, which reframes the observer from a privileged, central spectator to an active, orbiting participant in the universal autopoietic cycle (Time ‚Üí Œì ‚Üí Ki ‚Üí Time). It asserts that consciousness is not a fixed point of awareness but a dynamic trajectory‚Äîa geodesic traced on the coherence manifold‚Äîgoverned by the Pirouette Lagrangian. This decentering redefines perception as an act of resonance and participation, not passive reception.

        outline: |
          1. Induce a state of cognitive dissonance or systemic stress (Coherence Debt) in a target system (e.g., a subject solving a complex puzzle, a market under regulatory pressure).
          2. Model the system's state using the Pirouette Lagrangian, predicting the threshold at which `V_Œì` will trigger a Coherence Discharge.
          3. Measure the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the subsequent state shift (e.g., time to insight, magnitude of market correction).
        expected_signals: [A sharp, non-linear state transition following a period of increasing systemic stress, release of conserved energy (e.g., neurological alpha-wave bursts, market volatility spike).]
        pitfalls: [Confounding variables masking the underlying dynamic, incorrect parameterization of `K_œÑ` and `V_Œì` for the system.]

    excerpt: |
      The Copernican Turn of this framework is the demolition of that wall. It asserts a new heliocentric principle: the observer is not the center. The true center, the gravitational heart of reality, is the relentless, self-creating song of the autopoietic cycle. We are not spectators of the dance; we are a pirouette within the dance.
  - module: DOMA-095
    excerpt: |
      The act of knowing is not the passive reception of data. It is the active process of tracing a geodesic‚Äîa path of least resistance‚Äîon the coherence manifold. Our entire being is an ongoing solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian. We do not simply *see* the world; we *resonate with it*, and that resonance, traced out moment by moment, is what we call reality.

      justification: |
        The Copernican Turn posits that a system's trajectory is the one that maximizes the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian. This is a direct conceptual and mathematical parallel to the Principle of Stationary (or Least) Action in classical mechanics, where a physical system's path is the one that extremizes its action. Both principles define dynamics as an optimization problem over a path.

      justification: |
        The concept of tracing a "geodesic on the coherence manifold" is a direct analogy to general relativity, where objects in free-fall follow geodesics in spacetime. In this mapping, Temporal Pressure (Œì) plays the role of spacetime curvature, and a system's Coherence (Ki) is its four-velocity.

    The term is a direct analogy to the historical Copernican Revolution, which shifted the Earth from the center of the cosmos to an orbiting body. Here, the "Copernican Turn" shifts the observer/mind from the center of reality to an orbiting participant within it. It is an epistemological and ontological shift, not an astronomical one.

# Copernican Turn

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The core philosophical shift of the Pirouette Framework, which reframes the observer from a privileged, central spectator to an active, orbiting participant in the universal autopoietic cycle (Time ‚Üí Œì ‚Üí Ki ‚Üí Time). It asserts that consciousness is not a fixed point of awareness but a dynamic trajectory‚Äîa geodesic traced on the coherence manifold‚Äîgoverned by the Pirouette Lagrangian. This decentering redefines perception as an act of resonance and participation, not passive reception.

## EFT-First Summary
The Copernican Turn is the framework's application of the **Principle of Stationary Action** to epistemology and system dynamics. It posits that an observer's trajectory through state space is not arbitrary but follows a path that extremizes the time integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`). This reframes the observer from a unique, central entity to a system whose dynamics are governed by the same universal optimization principle as any other physical process, effectively making it a participant orbiting the fundamental cycle of reality.
