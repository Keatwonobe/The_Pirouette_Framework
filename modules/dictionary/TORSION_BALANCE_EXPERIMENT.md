    To listen for gravity's hidden echo in the silent swing of a pendulum, seeking the ghost of a larger force in the spaces between atoms.
  law: |
    If the Γ-field possesses a short-range component, then a torsion balance will measure a periodic torque that deviates from the Newtonian r⁻² prediction, with a magnitude and phase dependent on the attractor's geometry and rotational frequency.
  philosophy: |
    This experiment represents the critical step from axiomatic modeling to empirical validation. It is not merely a test of gravity, but a direct, falsifiable query posed to the Γ-field, seeking to ground the entire Pirouette Framework in measurable reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  A high-precision, cryogenic vacuum experiment designed to detect the short-range, non-Newtonian signature of the Gladiator Force (Γ-field) by measuring minute deviations from the inverse-square law of gravity. It uses a rotating attractor mass and a sensitive torsion pendulum to search for a periodic torque consistent with a Yukawa-like potential, V(r)∝r⁻¹(1+αe⁻ʳ/λ), thereby testing the Γ-G Correspondence Principle.

    excerpt: |
      Hypothesis: The Γ-G Correspondence Principle predicts that the simple 1/r² force law is an approximation. At very short ranges (sub-millimeter), where the underlying field structure becomes more prominent, the force should deviate from pure Newtonian gravity. The potential should include a small, additional Yukawa-like term: V(r)=−G(m₁m₂/r)(1+αe⁻ʳ/λ)
  - module: XAP-001
    excerpt: |
      Falsifiability: If, within the limits of experimental sensitivity, no deviation from the inverse-square law is detected, this would place strict constraints on the parameters (α,λ) of the Γ-field, potentially falsifying this specific model of its short-range behavior. The detection of such a deviation would provide powerful, direct evidence for the framework.

        The proposed experiment is operationally identical to real-world searches for new forces that modify Newtonian gravity at short distances. These experiments, such as those conducted by the Eöt-Wash group, use torsion balances to place limits on the strength (α) and range (λ) of any hypothetical Yukawa-type interaction.

# Torsion Balance Experiment

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A high-precision, cryogenic vacuum experiment designed to detect the short-range, non-Newtonian signature of the Gladiator Force (Γ-field) by measuring minute deviations from the inverse-square law of gravity. It uses a rotating attractor mass and a sensitive torsion pendulum to search for a periodic torque consistent with a Yukawa-like potential, V(r)∝r⁻¹(1+αe⁻ʳ/λ), thereby testing the Γ-G Correspondence Principle.

## EFT-First Summary
This proposed experiment is a high-precision test for new short-range forces, operationally identical to real-world searches that place constraints on modifications to Newtonian gravity. It uses a torsion balance to look for a Yukawa-like potential, V(r)∝r⁻¹(1+αe⁻ʳ/λ), which is a common parameterization for hypothetical fifth forces or the effects of extra dimensions. A positive result would be interpreted as evidence for the Γ-field, while a null result would constrain the parameters α and λ, consistent with existing experimental limits from groups like Eöt-Wash.
