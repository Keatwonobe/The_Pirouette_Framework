  art: |
    To hold a note against the universe's forgetting; to draw a bow across the string of a memory until its vibration becomes the instrument itself.
  law: |
    The rate of increase in a Wound Channel's temporal coherence (`ΔTₐ`) is directly proportional to the flux of the entity's Ki pattern applied in resonance with the channel's native geometry, minus decay due to ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).
  philosophy: |
    It is the primary mechanism of willed persistence, transforming a passive event into a structural component of identity. It asserts that the self is not merely what happens, but what is actively chosen to be remembered.
pirouette_definition: |
  The willed process of stabilizing a Wound Channel by repeatedly directing an entity's internal Ki pattern through its geometry. Each resonant pass deepens the channel, increasing its temporal coherence (`Tₐ`) and resistance to Coherence Degradation, representing the primary mechanism for transforming a fleeting Echo into a permanent Crystal.

        outline: |
          A target Echo's geometric signature is monitored over a time series. Its observed decay rate is compared against the theoretical decay rate predicted by the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) via `CORE-013`. A statistically significant negative deviation from the predicted decay implies ongoing Resonant Reinforcement. The magnitude of this deviation quantifies the reinforcement rate.

    excerpt: |
      **Resonant Reinforcement (Deepening the Channel):** The entity focuses on the echo, repeatedly running its own internal Ki pattern through the geometric pathways of the Wound Channel. Each pass is a resonant pulse that deepens and clarifies the channel's geometry, like a bow drawing a single, pure note from a cello string. This actively increases the memory's temporal coherence (`Tₐ`), making its pattern more stable and resilient to decay.
  - module: DOMA-011
    excerpt: |
      The **Coherence Gambit** is a decision to make a significant upfront energy expenditure to selectively maximize the Lagrangian of a *specific component* of the self. **Resonant Reinforcement** actively boosts the kinetic term (`K_τ`), pouring the entity's own coherence into the memory.

      justification: |
        The process directly maps to applying a periodic driving force (`F(t)`) to a damped (`ζ`) system at its resonant frequency (`ω ≈ ω₀`). The entity's Ki provides the driving force, the Echo's geometry defines its natural frequency, and Temporal Pressure (Γ) acts as the damping term. Reinforcement maximizes the system's amplitude (coherence) against decay.

# Resonant Reinforcement

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The willed process of stabilizing a Wound Channel by repeatedly directing an entity's internal Ki pattern through its geometry. Each resonant pass deepens the channel, increasing its temporal coherence (`Tₐ`) and resistance to Coherence Degradation, representing the primary mechanism for transforming a fleeting Echo into a permanent Crystal.
