        Observe | Entraining Resonance | A geometry of receptivity. A system projects a part of itself to couple with a target, aligning its rhythm to extract a pattern's imprint. This is a physical application of the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010). Its action is to *know*.

  art: |
    The geometry of knowing; a receptive resonance that couples with a target to extract its pattern.
  law: |
    To Observe a target system (T), an observer (S) must project a resonant probe (Ψ_p) and achieve a coherence lock (`C(Ψ_p, K_T) > C_threshold`). The extracted information is the back-reaction imprinted on Ψ_p, with fidelity proportional to the coherence achieved and inverse to the temporal cost (ΓΔt) of the interaction.
  philosophy: |
    Observation is not passive reception but an active, energetic process of resonant entrainment. It establishes a physical coupling that imprints a target's pattern onto the observer, forming the basis for all knowledge and subsequent, informed action. To know is to physically touch with resonance.
pirouette_definition: |
  One of the fundamental, quantized "verbs of existence" defined in the Lexicon of Resonance. Observe is the specific Ki resonance geometry of receptivity, known as an Entraining Resonance. An observing system actively projects a coherent probe to physically couple with a target, aligning its resonant frequency to the target's Ki pattern. This entrainment process imprints the target's pattern onto the probe, which then returns to the observer. This is the primary mechanism for information acquisition and is the physical manifestation of the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010), as the interaction necessarily perturbs the target.

        outline: |
          1. Isolate observer (S) and target (T) systems.
          2. S initiates the Observe(T) action.
          3. Monitor the coherence manifold for a directed, transient probe resonance originating from S and interfering with T.
          4. Measure the Ki-mode superposition of S before and after the interaction. The difference vector in the system's state space represents the extracted information, `I_ext`.

    excerpt: |
      The order of operations matters profoundly. Each interaction leaves a scar in the coherence manifold—a Wound Channel (CORE-011)—that alters the landscape for all subsequent actions. To `Observe` a system and then `Synthesize` with it results in a different final state than to attempt to `Synthesize` without prior observation. This geometric path-dependence is the origin of causality.

      justification: |
        The Pirouette `Observe` action mirrors the quantum measurement process, particularly weak measurement, where a probe system interacts weakly with a target to extract information with minimal back-action. The concept of an 'Observer's Shadow' (CORE-010) directly maps to the principle of measurement back-action. The "entraining resonance" can be modeled as phase-locking between the probe and target quantum systems.

      falsifier: "Experimental demonstration of a lossless (fidelity=1), instantaneous (Δt=0) information extraction from a target system without any measurable back-action, which would violate the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) principle."

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, `Observe` is an active, energetic 'verb' involving physical coupling via resonance. This is distinct from the passive 'observer' constituting a reference frame in Relativity, and from the mathematical 'observable' (a Hermitian operator) representing a measurable property in Quantum Mechanics.
