        This phenomenon is a phase transition driven by the relentless search for maximal coherence. It occurs when a system in a low-pressure environment (`Œì`) finds a more efficient path to stability. It trades a complex, static, multi-polar symmetry for a simpler, bipolar form that expresses the "lost" dimension's information as a stable, coherent temporal oscillation.

  art: |
    A silent sculpture, finding its form too costly in the quiet, allows one of its lines to melt, not into a puddle, but into a resonant melody. The structure‚Äôs complexity is not lost but reborn as a living rhythm.
  law: |
    Under persistent low Temporal Pressure (Œì), a system will evolve to maximize its Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) by trading complex, high-cost static spatial symmetry for a simpler spatial form plus a coherent, low-cost temporal oscillation, conserving information in the process.
  philosophy: |
    A system's identity is not immutably tied to its form, but to its total coherence. Dimensional Unfolding reveals that when shape becomes inefficient, a system can re-encode its identity into rhythm, demonstrating that a stable song can be a more robust expression of self than a rigid statue.
pirouette_definition: |
  A phase transition, driven by the maximization of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p), in which a system under low Temporal Pressure (Œì) reconfigures its internal state. It simplifies its static spatial symmetry (Ki) while converting the energy and information from a 'folded' spatial degree of freedom into a stable, coherent temporal oscillation (œâ_k) with high Time Adherence (T_a). This process re-encodes the system's identity from its static form to its dynamic rhythm.

        outline: |
          1. Characterize the system's environment to confirm a persistent state of low Temporal Pressure (Œì).
          2. Map the system's static internal geometry (Ki) to determine its symmetry group (e.g., 3-fold rotational symmetry).
          3. Monitor the system for a spontaneous reconfiguration to a lower-order spatial symmetry (e.g., 2-fold bipolar symmetry).
          4. Simultaneously, perform frequency analysis on the system's temporal signature. A successful Unfolding is confirmed by the emergence of a sharp, stable peak at a characteristic frequency (œâ_k), indicating high Time Adherence (T_a).

    excerpt: |
      The system can find a state of higher net coherence (`ùìõ_p`) by simplifying its spatial form to a 2-fold pattern and expressing the remaining complexity as a rhythm. The new state has a simpler spatial `Ki` but now possesses a stable, coherent resonant frequency (`œâ_k`). This dynamic state is far less costly to maintain in the low-`Œì` environment (`V_Œì` approaches zero). The system has optimized itself by becoming a musician, finding that a simple, ringing note is a more coherent solution than a silent, complex sculpture.
  - module: DOMA-164
    excerpt: |
      The core insight of this modernized view is that the emergent oscillation is not merely a carrier of encoded information; the new rhythm *is* the information. The system's identity fundamentally shifts from its shape to its song. This new identity is defined by the rich characteristics of its resonance... The entity's Wound Channel (CORE-011) is likewise transformed. It no longer leaves the static impression of a complex shape in the coherence manifold, but the persistent, rhythmic pulse of its new song. Its memory becomes a beat.

        In SSB, a system with a symmetric Lagrangian settles into a ground state with lower symmetry. Dimensional Unfolding is analogous, where a high-symmetry spatial state (the unstable maximum of the potential V(œÜ)) transitions to a lower-symmetry dynamic state (a point on the minimum of V(œÜ)). The "unfolded dimension" conceptually maps to the emergent Nambu-Goldstone modes, which represent the system's new dynamical degrees of freedom.

        In the Jahn-Teller effect, a molecule in a high-symmetry electronic configuration will spontaneously distort its geometry to achieve a lower-energy, lower-symmetry state. This distortion trades electronic/geometric complexity for new vibrational modes (a dynamic rhythm). This provides a concrete, measurable example of a system trading static spatial symmetry for dynamic stability.

  disambiguation: |
    The term "Dimensional Collapse" is deprecated because it incorrectly implies a loss of information or a destructive failure. "Unfolding" is preferred as it correctly describes a conservative reconfiguration process where information previously encoded in a static spatial dimension is "unfolded" into the time domain as a coherent rhythm. The process is a transformation, not a destruction.

# Dimensional Unfolding

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A phase transition, driven by the maximization of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p), in which a system under low Temporal Pressure (Œì) reconfigures its internal state. It simplifies its static spatial symmetry (Ki) while converting the energy and information from a 'folded' spatial degree of freedom into a stable, coherent temporal oscillation (œâ_k) with high Time Adherence (T_a). This process re-encodes the system's identity from its static form to its dynamic rhythm.

## EFT-First Summary
No formal mapping has been adopted. A promising candidate is Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking, where a symmetric system settles into a lower-symmetry ground state, giving rise to new dynamical degrees of freedom (Nambu-Goldstone modes). In this analogy, the "unfolded dimension" corresponds to the emergent dynamic modes that carry the information of the broken symmetry.
