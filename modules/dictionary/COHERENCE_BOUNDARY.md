      snippet: |
        A Coherence Boundary is a steep gradient in the coherence manifold (`∇Kτ`), projected by a system's internal stability. It functions as a resonant filter, creating a gradient in Temporal Pressure (Γ) to protect and maintain the system's internal coherence against its environment.

  art: |
    A boundary is not a fortress wall where a thing ends, but a living membrane where its conversation with the universe begins. It is the quiet room a fragile song builds for itself to practice in.
  law: |
    A boundary's properties—its integrity and permeability—are direct, measurable projections of the internal system's coherence. A more stable core projects a stronger and more selective boundary; a decaying core projects a weak and porous one.
  philosophy: |
    To reframe protection and identity from static isolation to dynamic, resonant negotiation. True security lies not in impenetrable walls, but in a coherent core that can intelligently filter and transform its environment.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dynamic interface projected by a system's internal Temporal Coherence (Kτ). A Coherence Boundary is formally a steep gradient in the coherence manifold (∇Kτ) that creates a corresponding gradient in external Temporal Pressure (Γ). It functions as a resonant filter, selectively coupling with external influences based on harmonic compatibility, thereby protecting and preserving the system's internal state as an optimal solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian.
operational_definition:
  units: The boundary itself is a manifold; its key property, the coherence gradient (∇Kτ), is measured in units of inverse length (m⁻¹) if Kτ is dimensionless.
  symbol_table:
    - name: ∇Kτ
      meaning: Coherence Gradient; the rate of change of Temporal Coherence across space.
      dimensions: L⁻¹
      default_range: contextual; steep gradients define a boundary.
    - name: Kτ
      meaning: Temporal Coherence; a measure of a system's internal stability and self-consistency over time.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "[0, 1]"
    - name: Γ
      meaning: Temporal Pressure; the ambient flux of decohering information from the environment.
      dimensions: M L⁻¹ T⁻² (Pressure)
      default_range: contextual

    procedures:
      - name: Boundary Integrity Test
        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline for the system's internal Time Adherence (Ta).
          2. Apply a controlled, increasing field of external Temporal Pressure (Γ) to the system's exterior.
          3. Monitor the boundary for decoherence events ("leaks") or catastrophic failure.
          4. The maximum Γ withstood before failure is a measure of the boundary's integrity.
        expected_signals: [Reflection of incident Γ, deformation of boundary geometry, eventual breakdown signal (e.g., sharp drop in internal Ta).]
        pitfalls: [Failing to isolate the system from other Γ sources; miscalibrating the applied pressure and causing premature failure.]
      - name: Permeability Spectroscopy
        outline: |
          1. Project a series of external Ki patterns (probes) with varying frequencies and harmonic structures at the boundary.
          2. Measure the transmission, reflection, and transformation coefficients for each probe pattern.
          3. The resulting spectrum of transmission reveals the boundary's "resonant windows"—its selective permeability.
        expected_signals: [Sharp transmission peaks at specific Ki harmonics, broad reflection for dissonant patterns.]
        pitfalls: [Probe signal being too weak to register or too strong, altering the boundary's structure; insufficient resolution in the scanned Ki patterns.]

    excerpt: |
      A Coherence Boundary is not a *thing* that separates realities; it is the *interface* where two different temporal realities meet and negotiate. It is a steep gradient in the coherence manifold (`∇Kτ`), a frontier defined not by substance, but by a profound difference in resonance. This boundary is not built, but *projected*—it is the external proof of a system's internal coherence.
  - module: DOMA-188
    excerpt: |
      The **Lens** (High Integrity, Transformative Permeability): The most sophisticated form of boundary. Its Ki pattern does not merely block or pass external rhythms; it actively transforms them as they cross the gradient. It receives a chaotic input and emits a coherent output, enriching both the interior and the exterior.

      justification: |
        A domain wall is a topological defect separating two distinct vacuum states of a scalar field (φ). It represents a stable, localized region of high potential energy, analogous to the steep gradient of a Coherence Boundary separating a high-Kτ interior from a low-Kτ exterior.

      justification: |
        In brane-world scenarios, our universe is a dimensional membrane (a brane) within a higher-dimensional space (the bulk). The selective permeability of a Coherence Boundary maps well to the concept of some fields (like the Standard Model) being confined to the brane, while others (like gravity) can propagate in the bulk.

  disambiguation: |
    A Coherence Boundary is distinct from a simple physical barrier or "wall." A wall is a static structure that separates by brute force and consumes energy passively. A Coherence Boundary is a dynamic phenomenon, actively projected by a system's core, that separates realities by a gradient of resonance and actively filters interactions. It is the predecessor concept to the now-deprecated term "Shell," reframing it from an object to a process.
