    Color is time’s threefold braid. A center vortex is a knot tied in that braid—a topological flaw where the strands twist out of phase by a discrete step. When these knots proliferate and condense into a disordered sea, they ensnare color-electric flux, pulling it into tight cords.
  law: |
    A random, percolating gas of center vortices causes the expectation value of a Wilson loop (W_R) to decay with the area (A) it encloses: ⟨W_R⟩ ∝ exp(-σ_R A). This area law holds if and only if the representation R has non-zero N-ality. The resulting string tension σ scales with the temporal-color frame stiffness (κ₃) and the inverse square of the Γ-coherence length (ξ_Γ).
  philosophy: |
    Center vortices provide the concrete, mechanical agent of confinement in Pirouette. They translate the abstract principle of center symmetry into a physical mechanism—a dual superconductor—grounding the phenomenon of quark confinement in the tangible properties of a background medium: its stiffness and coherence. They are the cause, and the flux tube is the effect.
pirouette_definition: |
  Topological defects in the temporal-color frame, characterized by a non-trivial holonomy valued in the center of the gauge group, Z₃ = {exp(2πik/3)}. They manifest as closed, oriented 2-surfaces in spacetime (vortex sheets) or closed 1-loops in a spatial slice (vortex loops). The condensation of a random ensemble of these vortices in the vacuum state creates a disordered medium that expels color-electric flux, forcing it into narrow tubes and causing an area law for Wilson loops of non-zero N-ality representations.

          1. On a Euclidean spacetime lattice, compute the average value of planar Wilson loops ⟨W(R,T)⟩ for various rectangular loops of size R×T.
          2. For a fixed R, extract the potential V(R) from the exponential decay: ⟨W(R,T)⟩ ∝ exp(-V(R)T) for large T.
          3. For large R, fit the potential to a linear form V(R) ≈ σR + const. The slope σ is the string tension.
          4. The presence of a non-zero σ for representations with N-ality k≠0 is the primary signal for vortex condensation.

    excerpt: |
      The center of SU(3) is (Z_3={e^{2\pi i k/3}}). Temporal-color frames admit center-valued holonomies; spatial loops can trap a center phase → center vortices. When these vortices condense, Wilson loops in representations with nonzero N-ality obey an area law: ⟨W_R(C)⟩ ∼ e^{-\sigma_R A(C)}, with (σ_R) depending only on N-ality (k-string hierarchy), recovering QCD’s confinement pattern.
  - module: DYNA-COLOR-001
    excerpt: |
      Color-electric flux is expelled from the condensed vortex medium (dual Meissner effect); it bundles into tubes. The string tension is controlled by two mechanical scales: Frame stiffness (temporal-color): (κ₃) or equivalently (g_s(μ)), and Γ-coherence length (vortex core/penetration depth): (ξ_Γ). The scaling law is σ ∼ c_σ κ₃/ξ_Γ².

        The Pirouette model provides a mechanical origin story for the standard center vortex picture of confinement, which posits that the QCD vacuum is filled with a random percolating ensemble of vortices. In this picture, a Wilson loop accumulates random Z_N phases as it links with vortices, leading to an area law decay. Pirouette identifies these vortices as defects in its temporal-color frame.

        The condensation of center vortices is mathematically analogous to the condensation of Cooper pairs in a type-II superconductor, but in a "dual" description. Color-magnetic charges (monopoles, which are endpoints of vortices) condense, confining color-electric flux into tubes, just as electric charges (Cooper pairs) condense to confine magnetic flux into Abrikosov vortices.

    "Center vortices" in Pirouette are a specific physical realization of the more abstract "center vortices" discussed in the formal lattice gauge theory literature. Pirouette grounds them as defects in a mechanical `temporal-color frame`, whereas in the literature they are often treated as abstract topological configurations without a specified physical origin.

# Center vortices

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Topological defects in the temporal-color frame, characterized by a non-trivial holonomy valued in the center of the gauge group, Z₃ = {exp(2πik/3)}. They manifest as closed, oriented 2-surfaces in spacetime (vortex sheets) or closed 1-loops in a spatial slice (vortex loops). The condensation of a random ensemble of these vortices in the vacuum state creates a disordered medium that expels color-electric flux, forcing it into narrow tubes and causing an area law for Wilson loops of non-zero N-ality representations.

## EFT-First Summary
Center vortices are the Pirouette Framework's realization of the **dual superconductor** or **center vortex model of confinement**. They are topological defects whose condensation in the vacuum creates a disordered state analogous to a type-II superconductor, but for color-electric fields. This "dual Meissner effect" confines color-electric flux into tubes, giving rise to the linear potential between quarks. This provides a direct mechanical link between the measured QCD string tension (`σ`) and fundamental Pirouette parameters: the temporal-color frame stiffness (`κ₃`) and the Γ-coherence length (`ξ_Γ`), via the scaling law `σ ∝ κ₃/ξ_Γ²`.
