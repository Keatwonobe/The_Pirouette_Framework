  art: |
    The width of the channel through which the river of time can flow without flooding the banks of the self. It is the clarity of the lens through which an agent perceives the dance of moments, determining what is music and what is noise.
  law: |
    An agent's skill (ΔT_agent) is the maximum rate of environmental temporal information (ΔT_env) it can process and act upon isochronously, maintaining a phase-lock (Δτ ≈ 0) with its environment before coherence breaks.
  philosophy: |
    Skill is not the accumulation of static knowledge, but the dynamic cultivation of temporal acuity. It represents an agent's developed capacity to resonate with reality, transforming the chaotic noise of the world into a coherent, actionable signal that enables effortless action.
pirouette_definition: |
  An agent's Skill (ΔT_agent) is its maximum sustainable bandwidth for coherently processing incoming temporal information from the environment (ΔT_env). It quantifies the upper limit of environmental 'challenge' an agent can isochronously match before temporal desynchronization occurs, leading to states of anxiety or cognitive overload. It is the agent-side term in the Flow condition: `ΔT_env = ΔT_agent`.

          Subject an agent to a task with a controllably variable rate of environmental information (ΔT_env), such as a rhythmic response or decision-making stimulus. Increment ΔT_env systematically. ΔT_agent is determined as the maximum ΔT_env at which the agent can maintain isochronism (|Δτ| < ε) before performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, reaction time) degrade sharply or biometric indicators of stress (e.g., decreased HRV, frontal EEG desynchrony) are observed.

    excerpt: |
      The celebrated “challenge-skill” balance of Flow is the macroscopic experience of achieving equilibrium with the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). [...] Challenge is not an abstract property of a task, but the rate and dissonance of temporal information the environment presents. Skill is the agent's capacity to process that information coherently.

    excerpt: |
      This modernization allows for more direct measurement and intervention... The training protocols from PPS-038 are retained and reinforced, now with the explicit goal of training an agent's ability to quickly and robustly synchronize their internal clock with their environment. The first stage, Calibration, aims to map personal temporal bandwidth (`ΔT_agent`) via graded tasks.

        Shannon's Channel Capacity (C) defines the maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted through a noisy channel. ΔT_agent is conceptually analogous, representing the maximum rate of temporal information an agent (the channel) can process coherently (low noise) from the environment (the signal) to produce effective action.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'expertise' or 'knowledge,' which are forms of stored information (engrams). Pirouette's Skill is a real-time processing *rate*, a measure of temporal bandwidth, not a static inventory of facts or procedures. An agent can be knowledgeable but have low Skill if they cannot apply that knowledge under high temporal pressure.

# Skill

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An agent's Skill (ΔT_agent) is its maximum sustainable bandwidth for coherently processing incoming temporal information from the environment (ΔT_env). It quantifies the upper limit of environmental 'challenge' an agent can isochronously match before temporal desynchronization occurs, leading to states of anxiety or cognitive overload. It is the agent-side term in the Flow condition: `ΔT_env = ΔT_agent`.

## Information-Theoretic Summary
Skill (ΔT_agent) is formally mapped to the concept of **Channel Capacity** from information theory. In this view, the agent acts as a communication channel that processes a signal (environmental information) amidst noise (internal and external turbulence). Skill represents the maximum rate at which the agent can process this information while maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio, enabling coherent and effective action. This provides a mathematical basis for understanding performance limits and the conditions for optimal states like Flow.
