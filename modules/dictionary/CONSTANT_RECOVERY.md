  art: |
    Forging the universe's unchanging laws from the first principles of geometric form. It is the process of turning pure reason into the hard numbers that govern physical reality.
  law: |
    The numerical values of fundamental physical constants (e.g., α, a_e) are not arbitrary inputs to the theory, but are necessary, calculable outputs derived from geometric factors and interaction strengths defined within the framework's core axioms.
  philosophy: |
    Constant Recovery is the ultimate test of a theory's contact with reality. It asserts that the universe's parameters are not random, but are necessary consequences of an underlying geometric and logical structure, making the theory directly falsifiable against the most precise measurements in science.
pirouette_definition: |
  The process by which the numerical values of fundamental physical constants are derived *ab initio* from the geometric and topological principles of the Pirouette Framework. It serves as a primary validation pathway, translating the framework's abstract mathematical structures into concrete, falsifiable quantitative predictions that can be compared directly with experimental measurements.

      - name: First-Order Anomaly Recovery via Coherence Echo
        outline: |
          1. Model the electron's self-interaction as a perturbation (a "wake" or "echo") on the background coherence manifold, with a strength proportional to α.
          2. Calculate the perturbed geodesic of the electron's resonance on this deformed manifold using the methods of MATH-005.
          3. Integrate the interaction over a single phase cycle of the echo, which yields a fundamental geometric factor of 1/(2π).
          4. The predicted anomaly `a_e` is the product of the interaction strength and the geometric factor: `a_e = α / (2π)`.
        expected_signals: [A calculated value for `a_e` matching the experimentally measured value to high precision (~0.001159652).]
        pitfalls: [Incorrect derivation of the geometric factor, failure to account for higher-order echo effects, fundamental mismatch between the Coherence Echo model and physical reality.]

    excerpt: |
      Here, we consolidate the mathematical machinery of the framework into a set of concrete, quantitative, and falsifiable predictions. We will provide the explicit protocol for recovering the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) from the geometric principles of the "coherence echo."
  - module: MATH-010
    excerpt: |
      The anomaly arises from the electron's self-interaction—its resonance interacting with its own "wake" or "echo" in the coherence manifold, as described in CORE-009... The geometry of a single-cycle echo introduces a fundamental geometric factor of 1/(2*pi)... The first-order correction to the magnetic moment, a_e, is therefore the product of the interaction strength and the geometric factor: a_e = alpha / (2*pi).

  candidates:
    - target: Standard Model (QED) calculation of `aₑ`
      domain: SM
      mapping_kind: operational
      equation_hint: |
        aₑ (QED) = C₁(α/π) + C₂(α/π)² + ... where C₁ = 1/2.
      justification: |
        The framework's claim that `aₑ = α / (2π)` from geometric first principles is a direct operational mapping to the first-order QED "Schwinger term". It posits that the "coherence echo" formalism reproduces the result of the one-loop vertex correction in quantum electrodynamics without relying on field-theoretic methods. This provides a direct, numerically identical point of comparison and falsification.

      domain: theory
      falsifier: "The claim is falsified if the geometric factor `1/(2π)` cannot be rigorously derived from the axioms of CORE-009 and MATH-005, or if higher-order corrections predicted by the framework's echo model demonstrably diverge from experimental measurements."

  disambiguation: |
    Constant Recovery is a deductive process from first principles, not an inductive process of parameter fitting. The values of constants are predicted by the theory's structure, not adjusted to match experimental data.
