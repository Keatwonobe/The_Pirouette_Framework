        Annex H – Safety‑Valve Paragraph (Re‑Growth)
        If κ > 1.3 κ_nominal **or** Γ > 0.9 Γ_thr during Re‑Growth, invoke Safety Valve:
        • Divert 30 % reservoir coherence to sink
        • Lock Bloom triggers
        • Alert Governance tier‑0.

  art: |
    A second bloom, more vibrant but fragile, watched with a hair trigger. It is the moment a healed limb tests its strength, when a quiet system dares to expand once more into its full potential.
  law: |
    During the Re-Growth phase, if coherence pressure κ exceeds 1.3 times its nominal value (κ_nominal) or if temporal pressure Γ exceeds 0.9 times its threshold value (Γ_thr), the Safety Valve protocol must be invoked.
  philosophy: |
    Re-Growth acknowledges that stability is not static. It provides a managed-risk process for returning a system to full capacity after a disturbance, balancing the drive for recovery against the potential for catastrophic relapse. It codifies caution into the act of restoration.
pirouette_definition: |
  Re-Growth is a designated, high-risk operational phase characterized by the monitored re-introduction of system capacity or complexity following a quiescent period. It is governed by the Safety Valve protocol (Annex H, PPS-043), which actively mitigates runaway conditions by enforcing strict, reduced thresholds on coherence pressure (κ) and temporal pressure (Γ). Exceeding these thresholds immediately triggers automated containment measures and a tier-0 Governance alert.

        outline: |
          During a declared Re-Growth phase, continuously monitor κ and Γ sensor streams in real-time. Compare measured values against the hard-coded thresholds of 1.3 κ_nominal and 0.9 Γ_thr. Upon any single-sample exceedance of either threshold, a trigger is fired.

  - module: PPS-043
    excerpt: |
      Following a planned reset or unscheduled quiescent period, the system may enter a Re-Growth phase. This is not an automatic process and must be initiated by a Tier-2 Governance directive. During this period, standard operating limits are temporarily replaced by the stricter constraints outlined in the Safety-Valve protocol to ensure a controlled return to nominal function without resonant cascade.

      justification: |
        Re-Growth is analogous to a soft-start procedure in power electronics or control systems, where a system is brought online under reduced parameters (e.g., inrush current limiting) to avoid transient-induced damage or instability. The monitoring of κ and Γ is equivalent to monitoring voltage and current against strict, temporary limits.

      falsifier: "Observation of a runaway-resonance event during a Re-Growth phase where neither threshold was breached, implying a failure mode not captured by κ or Γ."

  disambiguation: |
    Re-Growth must be distinguished from the `Bloom` process. Re-Growth is a supervisory *phase* of the entire system returning to capacity. `Bloom` is a specific generative *action* that is actively suspended ("locked") as a primary safety measure if Re-Growth becomes unstable.
