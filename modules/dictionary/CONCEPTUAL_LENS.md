        This is an act of human reason and translation. It replaces the old, rigid "Fractal Menu" with a dynamic, conceptual mapping, allowing a Weaver to analyze a system by translating its components into the language of the framework.

  art: |
    To see the universal song played on different instruments; to recognize the forest's dance in a corporation's strategy and a scholar's idea. It is the art of coherent translation across scales.
  law: |
    By mapping a domain's key features (identity, pressure, memory, synthesis) to the framework's universal principles (Kτ, Γ, Wound Channel, Alchemical Union), the system's most probable evolutionary path (geodesic) can be qualitatively determined.
  philosophy: |
    This protocol asserts that universal laws are not merely analogous but directly correspondent across all domains of existence, making any system legible through a universal grammar. It posits human reason as the primary instrument for decoding this grammar, bridging the abstract framework to concrete reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  A qualitative, four-step protocol for applying the Pirouette Framework to a specific domain. It operates via the Principle of Coherent Correspondence, translating a system's observable features into the framework's universal variables (Coherence, Temporal Pressure, Wound Channel, Alchemical Union) to determine its most probable evolutionary path (geodesic) and potential for synthetic transformation.

      - name: Conceptual Lens Mapping
        outline: |
          1.  **Define System and Boundary:** Isolate the analytical target ("instrument") from its environment ("orchestra").
          2.  **Map Core Variables:** Translate domain-specific phenomena into the universal principles (Kτ, Γ, Wound Channel, Alchemical Union) using the mapping questions.
          3.  **Locate the Geodesic:** Apply the Pirouette Lagrangian to predict the system's path of maximal coherence against environmental pressure.
          4.  **Identify Resonant Handshakes:** Analyze interactions to find conditions for Alchemical Union and potential phase shifts.
        expected_signals: [A coherent narrative explaining system dynamics, a falsifiable prediction of the system's trajectory, identification of leverage points for transformation.]
        pitfalls: [Poorly defined system boundaries, misidentification of the core coherence pattern (Kτ), confirmation bias in mapping, confusing symptoms with causal pressures (Γ).]

      This is an act of human reason and translation. It replaces the old, rigid "Fractal Menu" with a dynamic, conceptual mapping, allowing a Weaver to analyze a system by translating its components into the language of the framework.
  - module: DOMA-034
    excerpt: |
      The coherence (Kτ) of a corporation is its stable business model and brand identity. The pressure (Γ) is market competition and technological disruption. Its Wound Channel is its corporate culture, infrastructure, and brand reputation. Its path of maximal coherence is to maximize profit and market share. An Alchemical Union is a strategic acquisition that merges two companies into a new entity that dominates a market neither could have conquered alone.

        System(q_i, q'_i) -> L(q, q') = T - V
      justification: |
        The process of identifying a system's generalized coordinates (q), kinetic energy (T), and potential energy (V) to formulate its specific Lagrangian is a direct conceptual analog to the Conceptual Lens. Both are structured translation protocols that map a concrete system onto an abstract, universal formalism to predict its dynamics.

  claims:
    - statement: "The Conceptual Lens protocol, when applied by multiple trained Weavers to the same well-defined system, produces convergent mappings of the core variables (Kτ, Γ, Wound Channel)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If independent analyses by trained practitioners yield irreconcilable mappings of the core variables for the same system, the protocol would be demonstrated as overly subjective or the underlying Principle of Correspondence would be weakened."

  disambiguation: |
    Must be distinguished from its quantitative counterpart, the Resonance Lens. The Conceptual Lens uses human reason and translation to map concepts. The Resonance Lens uses computational algorithms to extract patterns from data. One is an act of interpretation, the other of instrumentation.
