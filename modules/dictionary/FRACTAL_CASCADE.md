        The original module correctly identified the wave's lifecycle as a model for coherence over time. This process does not end with a single wave... Eventually, the wave breaks. Its singular coherence dissolves, not into nothingness, but into a fractal cascade of smaller, self-similar vortices and eddies.

    A great wave shatters on the shore, not into noise, but into a thousand smaller, perfect copies of itself. The parent's song is not ended but passed down to a chorus, creating echoes from echoes.
  law: |
    The total coherence of a system is conserved during a cascade; the coherence (K_τ) of the parent Ki structure is redistributed among a power-law distribution of descendant, self-similar structures.
  philosophy: |
    A universe with only primary Ki structures would be monolithic and sterile. The Fractal Cascade is the engine of diversification, ensuring that every resolution of a large-scale tension seeds a rich, multi-scale ecosystem of form and function.
pirouette_definition: |
  The process by which a large-scale, primary Ki pattern, having reached its amplitude limit, dissolves its singular coherence into a spectrum of smaller, self-similar resonant structures (e.g., vortices, eddies). This dynamic conserves and redistributes coherence across scales, acting as a primary mechanism for generating complexity and scale-invariance.

          1. Isolate a system undergoing Ki Morphogenesis (e.g., a fluid shear layer).
          2. Use particle image velocimetry or a similar field imaging technique to track the primary wave (Ψ) as it grows in amplitude.
          3. Observe the wave's breaking point and track the resulting field of vortices ({ψᵢ}).
          4. Perform a statistical analysis on the size distribution of the descendant vortices to extract the scaling exponent (D).

    excerpt: |
      This process does not end with a single wave. The primary wave emerges, a single, large-scale Ki pattern. Eventually, the wave breaks. Its singular coherence dissolves, not into nothingness, but into a fractal cascade of smaller, self-similar vortices and eddies. This cascade is a critical dynamic. The coherence of the first wave is not lost; it is reinvested, seeding complexity at finer and finer scales. This is a primary engine for the universe's fractal nature.

    excerpt: |
      We sought the origin of conflict and found the blueprint for harmony. The First Wave teaches a profound lesson: when two opposing currents meet, the universe does not choose a side. It invents a dance... Every conflict is a shear in the fabric of time, waiting for a Weaver to find the resonant pattern that transforms tension into a song. [The subsequent cascade distributes that song across all octaves.]

        The Fractal Cascade is a generalization of the Richardson-Kolmogorov energy cascade in fluid turbulence. Both describe the transfer of a conserved quantity (energy or coherence) from large-scale structures to progressively smaller, self-similar scales, following a characteristic power law, until dissipation dominates.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from mathematical fractals, which are static geometric objects. The Fractal Cascade is a *dynamic process* of scale-seeding. It is also distinct from simple chaotic decay, as the cascade conserves and redistributes coherence in a structured, self-similar manner.

# Fractal Cascade

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The process by which a large-scale, primary Ki pattern, having reached its amplitude limit, dissolves its singular coherence into a spectrum of smaller, self-similar resonant structures (e.g., vortices, eddies). This dynamic conserves and redistributes coherence across scales, acting as a primary mechanism for generating complexity and scale-invariance.

## EFT-First Summary
The Fractal Cascade is the Pirouette Framework's generalization of the turbulent energy cascade. A primary coherent pattern (Ki), analogous to a large-scale fluid eddy, breaks down and transfers its coherence to a hierarchy of smaller, self-similar structures. This process follows a power law, analogous to the Kolmogorov k⁻⁵/³ energy spectrum, and is the primary mechanism for generating scale-invariant complexity from simple resonant forms.
