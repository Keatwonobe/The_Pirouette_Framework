        Linearize around background density n_0: c_s^2 = dP/dρ|_{n_0}; emergent phonon field π obeys (∂_t^2 − c_s^2 ∇^2 + m_eff^2)π = 0.
        • m_eff arises from weak explicit symmetry breaking in V(Γ) (tail parameters μ, f in COSMO‑Γ‑CMB), not from the microscopic m_H.

  art: |
    A chorus of heavy bells, each with its own thunderous tone, can conspire through their collective ringing to produce a single, impossibly low hum that resonates across the entire cathedral. This shared hum is the effective mass, an echo far lighter than any of its sources.
  law: |
    The characteristic coherence scale of the Γ field, such as the de Broglie wavelength or Jeans length that sets the size of galactic halo cores, is governed by the effective mass (m_eff ≈ 10⁻²² eV/c²), not the mass of the fundamental quanta (m_H ≈ 17 MeV/c²).
  philosophy: |
    The concept of effective mass resolves the 29-order-of-magnitude tension between particle physics and cosmology without invoking ad-hoc particles or fine-tuned parameters. It demonstrates that vast scale separation can be a natural consequence of emergence, collective behavior, or underlying symmetries, unifying disparate phenomena within a single, predictive sector.
pirouette_definition: |
  The mass of the lowest-energy, long-wavelength dynamical degree of freedom in the Γ sector. This emergent mass governs cosmological-scale phenomena and can be orders of magnitude smaller than the mass of the sector's fundamental quanta (`m_H`). The mechanism of mass reduction determines its specific properties: it may be the mass of a collective excitation (e.g., a phonon in a condensate), the lightest eigenstate in a geometrically-suppressed mass spectrum (e.g., a clockwork model), or the curvature of a potential after a late-universe phase transition.

      - name: Cosmological Structure Inference
        outline: |
          Measure galactic halo properties (core profiles, substructure suppression scale, vortex spectra) and large-scale structure (matter power spectrum, CMB acoustic phases, integrated lensing). Fit observations to models derived from the candidate mechanisms (Superfluid, Clockwork, Cascade). The value of `m_eff` is the parameter that correctly reproduces the observed coherence length.
        expected_signals: [Suppression of small-scale structure below a `m_eff`-dependent cutoff, specific halo core profiles distinct from standard CDM, phase shifts in CMB acoustic peaks]
        pitfalls: [Degeneracies with baryonic feedback effects, difficulty in distinguishing between different mechanisms with low-resolution data]
      - name: Precision Laboratory Tests
        outline: |
          For mechanisms predicting specific coupling patterns (e.g., Clockwork), perform precision measurements of lepton anomalous magnetic moments (g-2), electric dipole moments (EDM), and global electroweak fits. A confirmed pattern of deviations from the Standard Model would indirectly determine `m_eff` by fixing the model parameters (e.g., `m`, `q`, `N`).
        expected_signals: [A specific, non-universal pattern of deviations in g-2 for e, μ, τ; loop-level interferences in EW observables]
        pitfalls: [Signals may be too small to detect, new physics from other sectors could mimic the signal]

    excerpt: |
      Formalize and resolve the 29‑order‑of‑magnitude 'mass tension' between the lepton‑scale Pressuron mass (m_H ≈ 17 MeV from XXP‑015) and the cosmology‑scale requirement (m_L ≈ 10^−22 eV in fuzzy‑DM language) without violating MATH‑018 predictivity rules. Goal: show that the light mode governing structure is a *derived* eigenmode/collective excitation, not an ad‑hoc second particle with tuned mass.
  - module: MATH-021
    excerpt: |
      The microscopic Γ quanta (m_H ≈ 17 MeV) form a self‑interacting condensate on cosmic scales; low‑energy excitations are phonons with dispersion ω^2 ≈ c_s^2 k^2 + m_eff^2. The *effective* mass m_eff can be ≪ m_H and even behave as ∼10^−22 eV in the sense of setting the de‑Broglie/Jeans cutoff, without introducing a fundamental ultralight particle.

        In the Superfluid/Condensate mechanism (A), `m_eff` is explicitly defined as the mass gap for long-wavelength collective excitations (phonons) of the heavy `m_H` field. This is in direct analogy to gapped modes in real-world superfluids or Bose-Einstein condensates.

        In the Clockwork/Alignment mechanism (B), `m_eff` corresponds to the lightest mass eigenvalue `m_L` of the coupled scalar chain. The exponential suppression `q⁻ᴺ` arises from the geometry of the theory space, providing a natural origin for the mass hierarchy.

      justification: |
        In the Phase Transition mechanism (C), `m_eff` is the curvature of the scalar potential in the true vacuum, occupied after a cosmological phase transition. The potential is engineered such that the curvature `V''` is large in the early false vacuum (giving `m_H`) and extremely small in the late-time true vacuum (giving `m_eff`).

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol `m_eff` is used ubiquitously in solid-state physics to denote the effective mass of an electron or hole in a crystal lattice, which is a conceptually similar (but physically distinct) idea of an emergent mass-like parameter for a quasiparticle in a medium.]
  disambiguation: |
    `m_eff` is the general term for the emergent, cosmologically-relevant mass. `m_L` is often used for `m_eff` in contexts where it represents the mass of a specific light particle eigenstate (Mechanisms B, C). `m_H` is always the mass of the fundamental, heavy quantum and should never be confused with `m_eff`. The central point of MATH-021 is that `m_eff` << `m_H`.
