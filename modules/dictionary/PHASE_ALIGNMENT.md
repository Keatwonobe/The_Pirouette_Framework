    Two dancers finding the same beat, two voices finding the same note. It is the moment before harmony, when separate rhythms lock into a shared pulse.

    For two resonant systems to constructively interfere and enable union, the relative phase difference (Δφ) between their fundamental Ki cycles must approach zero.

    Synchronization precedes synthesis. True union is not a collision of states but a shared timing of being, demonstrating that 'when' things happen is as fundamental as 'what' happens.

        outline: |
          Using a temporal probe sensitive to Ki frequencies, measure the fundamental resonance for each entity (A and B) and their combined signal (A+B) in the interaction zone. Phase alignment is achieved when the combined signal's amplitude consistently approaches the sum of the individual amplitudes (maximal constructive interference), and beat frequencies are minimized.

    excerpt: |
      A true dialogue is a human-scale Alchemical Union. Two minds, holding separate coherence manifolds (perspectives), engage in a Resonant Handshake by finding harmonic compatibility (shared values, common language) and phase alignment (listening, turn-taking).

        The concept directly mirrors phase-locking phenomena in classical systems, from coupled pendulums to electronic oscillators. It describes a state where interacting periodic systems adjust their rhythms to oscillate at a common frequency with a constant relative phase, enabling energy and information transfer.

# Phase Alignment

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A necessary condition for a Resonant Handshake, where the oscillatory cycles of two or more entities converge to a near-zero phase difference (Δφ → 0). This synchronization, or phase-lock, ensures their resonant echoes interfere constructively, allowing their individual coherence manifolds to be prepared for unification. It represents the temporal harmony required for an Alchemical Union.

## EFT-First Summary
In nonlinear dynamics, Phase Alignment corresponds to phase-locking between coupled oscillators, where interacting systems synchronize their timing (Δφ → 0). This condition is required to maximize constructive interference, a prerequisite for the fusion of their coherence manifolds and the subsequent emergence of a new, unified entity. It is the temporal component of resonance required for synthesis.
