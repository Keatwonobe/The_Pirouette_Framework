      snippet: |
        Each system is driven to optimize its own Lagrangian, but they are now dynamically coupled by the shared pressure term `V_Œì(Œì_c)`:
        `ùìõ_p(A) = K_œÑ(A) - V_Œì(Œì_c)`
        `ùìõ_p(B) = K_œÑ(B) - V_Œì(Œì_c)`
        A's attempt to maximize its internal coherence (`K_œÑ(A)`) increases the pressure on B, and vice-versa.

    The self-affirming resonance of a pattern; the integrity of a melody holding its form against a contrary note, proving its right to be sung.
  law: |
    Internal Coherence acts as the kinetic term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`), representing a system's capacity to do work by maintaining its pattern. A system's dynamics will follow a path that maximizes its time-integrated `K_œÑ` under the constraints of external Temporal Pressure.
  philosophy: |
    Coherence is the measure of a pattern's claim to existence. An entity persists not by virtue of its mass or energy, but by the robustness of its internal information structure‚Äîits ability to efficiently maintain its form and function amidst the universe's ceaseless, clarifying pressure.
pirouette_definition: |
  A scalar quantity representing the energetic measure of a system's structural and informational integrity. `K_œÑ` quantifies a system's ability to maintain its defining resonant pattern (`Ki`) against internal entropic decay and external Temporal Pressure (`Œì`). In the Pirouette Lagrangian, it functions as the kinetic term, which systems are driven to maximize. A high `K_œÑ` signifies a robust, efficient, and persistent pattern, proven through its performance in Resonant Tests.

        outline: |
          1. Isolate the target system in a controlled environment.
          2. Apply a calibrated external Temporal Pressure field (`V_Œì_test`) of known intensity and frequency.
          3. Measure the rate of Coherence Degradation via output signal decay, entropic radiation, or pattern deformation.
          4. `K_œÑ` is inferred as the system's resistance to this degradation. A higher `K_œÑ` corresponds to a lower degradation rate for a given `V_Œì_test`.
        expected_signals: [Damped oscillations in the system's primary frequency, broadband entropic radiation signature]
        pitfalls: [The measurement probe can form a Wound Channel with the target, altering its coherence; difficult to isolate the system from ambient Temporal Pressure.]

    excerpt: |
      The mechanics of the duel are a direct consequence of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) and the Principle of Maximal Coherence... A's attempt to maximize its internal coherence (`K_œÑ(A)`) increases the pressure on B, and vice-versa. The duel is the universe's method for stress-testing its solutions.

    excerpt: |
      Victory, therefore, belongs not to the most powerful, but to the most *efficient*. The winning pattern is the one that can sustain the most stable and efficient resonance‚Äîthe highest `K_œÑ`‚Äîfor the lowest energetic cost against the intense, shared pressure `V_Œì`. Form without balance is self-defeating.

      justification: |
        `K_œÑ` occupies the same position in the Pirouette Lagrangian as the kinetic term in classical and quantum field theory. It represents the internal, dynamic "energy" of the system's pattern, defined by its state and its rate of change, in opposition to the potential energy `V_Œì` imposed by external fields or pressures.

  adopted:
    - target: Kinetic Energy Term (T)
      rationale: The term's functional role in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`) is a direct mathematical analogy to the kinetic term in standard physics, representing the energy inherent in a system's dynamic state, separate from potential energy due to external fields.

  claims:
    - statement: "A system with higher `K_œÑ` will exhibit a lower rate of Coherence Degradation when subjected to an identical external Temporal Pressure `V_Œì`."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observation of a system with low structural stability (low inferred `K_œÑ`) consistently out-competing and fracturing a more stable system (high inferred `K_œÑ`) under controlled pressure, without a clear countervailing efficiency advantage."

  disambiguation: |
    `K_œÑ` is the scalar *measure* of a system's coherence (an energy value). `Ki` (as used in `DOMA-006`) refers to the qualitative *resonant pattern* or form itself (the "song" or "hypothesis"). A system *has* a `Ki`, which in turn *possesses* a `K_œÑ`.
