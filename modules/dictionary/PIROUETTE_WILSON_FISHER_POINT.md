  art: |
    In the swirling flow of scale, where details wash away, there is one point of perfect, stable balance. All systems approaching the brink of coherence are drawn to this single, universal posture.
  law: |
    The stability matrix eigenvalues at the Pirouette Wilson–Fisher fixed point determine the universal critical exponents (e.g., ν, γ_P) for any system whose coherence transition is described by the Landau–Pirouette Functional. These exponents must obey RG-derived hyperscaling relations, independent of substrate-specific microdynamics.
  philosophy: |
    This fixed point is the mathematical heart of Pirouette's universality claim. It establishes why disparate phenomena—a cognitive insight, a market crash, a physical condensation—can exhibit identical scaling behavior at their critical threshold. It replaces a zoo of specific models with a single, predictive, and substrate-agnostic geometric structure in the space of theories.
pirouette_definition: |
  The non-trivial, stable fixed point of the Renormalization Group (RG) flow for the Landau–Pirouette Functional (LPF) in dimensions d<4. It is located at coordinates (a*, b*, λ*) in the space of renormalized couplings, where a*=0 (criticality), b* = ε/3 > 0 (stability against collapse), and λ* is a function of the other couplings. The Pirouette Wilson–Fisher point acts as an attractor for the RG flow, governing the universal scaling behavior and critical exponents of all systems undergoing a continuous, second-order coherence transition.

        outline: |
          The fixed point is not measured directly; its existence and properties are inferred from its consequences.
          1. Identify a system undergoing a suspected second-order coherence transition.
          2. Measure an order parameter susceptibility, χ_P, and correlation length, ξ, as a function of a control parameter, T (e.g., T_a - T_c), near the critical point T_c for various system sizes L.
          3. Determine the critical exponents γ_P and ν by fitting data to power laws: χ_P ~ |T|^{-γ_P} and ξ ~ |T|^{-ν}.
          4. Test for data collapse by plotting χ_P L^{-γ_P/ν} against T L^{1/ν}. If all data for different L fall onto a single curve, the universality class is confirmed.
          5. The measured exponent values are direct predictions of the PWF point's stability eigenvalues (e.g., ν = 1/y_a).
        expected_signals: [Power-law divergence of observables at criticality, successful data collapse onto a universal scaling function]
        pitfalls: [Difficulty in precisely locating T_c, finite-size effects masking true asymptotic scaling, crossover effects from other irrelevant operators.]

      justification: |
        The LPF for a single complex order parameter ψ has O(2) symmetry (phase rotation). The RG analysis in MATH-026, using a dimensional-regularization scheme in d=4-ε, directly reproduces the calculation for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point that describes the XY model universality class. The "Pirouette" prefix specifies the context (coherence transitions via LPF), not a mathematical modification.

  disambiguation: |
    This is the *interacting* fixed point, distinct from the trivial Gaussian fixed point (where b*=0) that describes mean-field theory. The Pirouette Wilson–Fisher point is responsible for the non-classical critical exponents observed in systems with fluctuations below four dimensions. It is mathematically identical to the standard Wilson-Fisher point but is named to situate it within the Pirouette Framework's ontology of coherence.

# Pirouette Wilson–Fisher Point

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The non-trivial, stable fixed point of the Renormalization Group (RG) flow for the Landau–Pirouette Functional (LPF) in dimensions d<4. It is located at coordinates (a*, b*, λ*) in the space of renormalized couplings, where a*=0 (criticality), b* = ε/3 > 0 (stability against collapse), and λ* is a function of the other couplings. The Pirouette Wilson–Fisher point acts as an attractor for the RG flow, governing the universal scaling behavior and critical exponents of all systems undergoing a continuous, second-order coherence transition.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette Wilson–Fisher Point is the direct application of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point from statistical field theory to the Pirouette Framework's Landau-Pirouette Functional. As the LPF possesses O(2) symmetry for a complex order parameter, this fixed point governs the universality class of the XY model. Its properties, derived via the ε-expansion (ε=4-d), provide first-principles predictions for the non-mean-field critical exponents that characterize phase transitions in diverse systems, from superfluid helium to cognitive and social coherence phenomena.
