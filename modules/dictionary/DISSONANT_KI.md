        A system suffering from an unknown ailment presents a disconnected plot‚Äîa collection of clues, dissonant effects, and a chaotic `Wound Channel`. The Daedalus Gambit mandates that we give this plot a provisional antagonist. This is not a vague "disease," but a specific, dissonant `Ki` (resonant signature) with a characteristic persona.

triad:
  art: |
    The signature hum of a hidden saboteur; the discordant note in a system's symphony that reveals the presence and nature of an unseen player.
  law: |
    The narrative persona constructed from a dissonant `Ki` must generate a set of unique, falsifiable predictions (narrative echoes). If a persona fails to produce such predictions, it is an invalid model under the Daedalus Gambit protocol.
  philosophy: |
    By assigning a coherent persona and narrative to a pathology's signature, we transform an unaddressable mystery into a falsifiable antagonist. This makes the unknown scientifically tractable, providing a map where none exists.
pirouette_definition: |
  The characteristic resonant signature of a pathology, which is personified as a coherent antagonist under the Daedalus Gambit (`DOMA-097`) protocol. It is not merely the set of symptoms, but the inferred pattern of disruption that is given a name, motivation, and method (e.g., "The Thread Cutter"). This personification serves as a hypothesis-generation engine by translating the antagonist's story into testable narrative echoes.

      - name: Daedalus Gambit Protocol
        outline: |
          1.  **Map Disruption:** Chart the system's pathological flow states (`Laminar`, `Turbulent`, `Stagnant`) using Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`).
          2.  **Chart Dissonance:** Create a `Dissonance Ledger` of known unknowns, paradoxes, and causal gaps.
          3.  **Personify `Ki`:** Based on the disruption pattern, craft a coherent antagonist persona (e.g., Resonance Thief, Turbulence Engine).
          4.  **Write Narrative:** Synthesize the persona and data into a causal story that explains the observations.
          5.  **Trace Echoes:** Translate the narrative into specific, falsifiable hypotheses about the system.
        expected_signals: [Novel correlations between system variables, Spatially-clustered or temporally-patterned failure modes, Secondary metabolic or signaling cascade effects predicted by the persona's actions.]
        pitfalls: [The narrative becomes an unfalsifiable just-so story, The `Dissonance Ledger` is ignored or explained away without evidence, The persona is not updated or abandoned in the face of contradictory data.]

      justification: |
        Within the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), the Dissonant Ki represents the observable effects of an unknown pathological potential term, `V_pathology`, added to the system's equation of motion. The Daedalus Gambit is the structured methodology for inferring the characteristics of this term by observing its influence on the system's trajectory.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinct from the concept of 'Ki/Chi/Qi' as a metaphysical life force. In Pirouette, `Ki` refers specifically to a measurable, resonant signature or pattern of influence within a system, analogous to a characteristic frequency or a perturbative term in a physical model.

# Dissonant Ki

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The characteristic resonant signature of a pathology, which is personified as a coherent antagonist under the Daedalus Gambit (`DOMA-097`) protocol. It is not merely the set of symptoms, but the inferred pattern of disruption that is given a name, motivation, and method (e.g., "The Thread Cutter"). This personification serves as a hypothesis-generation engine by translating the antagonist's story into testable narrative echoes.

## EFT-First Summary
The Dissonant Ki is the operational signature of an unknown pathological potential term (`V_pathology`) added to a system's Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`). As detailed in `CORE-006` and `DOMA-097`, this term disrupts the system's normal trajectory (geodesic). The Daedalus Gambit protocol is the formal method for inferring the properties of `V_pathology` by constructing a coherent narrative persona from its observed effects, thereby generating a targeted program of falsifiable experiments.
