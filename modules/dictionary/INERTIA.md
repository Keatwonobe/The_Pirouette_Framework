        Inertia & Identity: An entity is perpetually interacting with the geometry of its own immediate past. This self-interaction is the origin of inertia. To change velocity or state is to fight against the shape of one's own Wound Channel. This provides a profound stability; an entity's identity is maintained because it is constantly "reminded" of what it was a moment ago by the very shape of the space it occupies.

    To move is to argue with the ghost of your last footstep. To change is to outrun the echo of who you just were. All of being is a constant negotiation with the wake you leave behind.
  law: |
    The energy required to alter an entity's state is directly proportional to the degree of deformation required to carve a new trajectory in its existing Wound Channel. State-change is resisted by the geometry of past states.
  philosophy: |
    Inertia is not a brute property of matter, but the active, continuous process of self-remembrance. It grounds identity in the physical geometry of the past, making stability the default state of being and change a true act of creation.
pirouette_definition: |
  The resistance to a change in an entity's state (e.g., momentum, resonance pattern) arising from its continuous interaction with its own immediate past. This self-interaction is mediated by the geometric echo propagating from the entity's Wound Channel, which reinforces the state that created it. Inertia is the measure of an entity's coupling to its own history.

          Apply a known motive force to a target entity while simultaneously modulating the local coherence manifold with a resonant field. The objective is to interfere with the echo propagating from the entity's Wound Channel. The reduction in force required to achieve a given acceleration, as a function of the modulation frequency and amplitude, quantifies the contribution of the Wound Channel to the entity's total inertia.

      At the Psychological Scale: A person's sense of self—their personality, habits, and beliefs—is the cumulative geometry of their entire life's Wound Channel. To "change one's mind" is a literal act of metaphysical engineering: the difficult work of carving a new path in a landscape shaped by a lifetime of echoes.

        Pirouette's Inertia provides a microphysical origin for the classical concept of inertial mass. It posits that the quantity 'm' is not a fundamental, intrinsic property but an emergent effect of the energy required for an entity to deform its own Wound Channel against its self-reinforcing echo.

    Distinguish from Gravitational Mass. While the equivalence principle is expected to hold, Pirouette posits distinct microphysical origins for each. Inertia arises from self-interaction with an entity's *own* Wound Channel, whereas gravity is proposed to arise from interaction with the Wound Channels of *other* entities.

# Inertia

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The resistance to a change in an entity's state (e.g., momentum, resonance pattern) arising from its continuous interaction with its own immediate past. This self-interaction is mediated by the geometric echo propagating from the entity's Wound Channel, which reinforces the state that created it. Inertia is the measure of an entity's coupling to its own history.

## EFT-First Summary
In standard models, inertia is encapsulated by the mass `m` in kinetic terms like `(1/2)m v^2`. Pirouette posits this `m` is not fundamental, but an emergent effect of an entity's self-interaction with its own past, mediated by a geometric 'Wound Channel'. This framework suggests that mass is a dynamic property that can, in principle, be modulated by altering the local spacetime geometry that governs this self-interaction echo.
