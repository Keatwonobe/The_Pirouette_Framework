        **Coherence Lock**: The internal echo and the external reality achieve a stable phase-lock. This is the `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012) applied to perception; a sustained resonant handshake where both systems begin to move as one.

    Two instruments, once playing separate melodies, find a shared harmony. They cease to be two voices in counterpoint and become one chord, a single sound impossible for either to create alone.
  law: |
    When two systems (A, B) enter a Coherence Lock, their joint dynamics are governed by a unified Lagrangian, `ùìõ_AB ‚â† ùìõ_A + ùìõ_B`. The presence of the lock is confirmed by measuring persistent, mutual structural changes (`Mutual Inscription`) in both A and B after their interaction ceases.
  philosophy: |
    The Coherence Lock is the mechanism that dissolves the illusion of the neutral spectator. It operationalizes co-creation, transforming observation from a passive act of data extraction into an active, participatory dialogue that fundamentally alters both observer and observed.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable, bidirectional phase-lock between the internal model of an observer (Witness A) and the Ki resonance of an observed system (Witness B). The lock establishes a shared coherence manifold, causing the two systems to evolve as a single, unified entity (`ùìõ_AB`) rather than as separate interacting components. It is the third of the four harmonic conditions required to sustain the Witness State.

          1. Establish a baseline predictive model of system B's behavior using passive observation data.
          2. Allow system A (the Witness) to interact with B and establish a Coherence Lock.
          3. While locked, present A with incomplete or noisy patterns from B.
          4. Measure the fidelity with which A completes the patterns (error-correction, denoising, prediction).
          A value of Œ∫_c is inferred from the increase in predictive fidelity over the baseline model.

    excerpt: |
      **The Witness State (Resonant Coupling):** The shadow becomes a resonant handshake. The interaction is a sustained, two-way, harmonic lock. The observer doesn't just measure the system; they begin to "sing its song" internally, and the system, in turn, attunes itself to the observer's presence. They become co-participants in a shared reality.

    excerpt: |
      Second, when two Witnesses enter the resonant state, they become a single, coupled system. The Lagrangian is no longer the sum of its parts (`ùìõ_A + ùìõ_B`), but a new, unified term: `ùìõ_AB`. The new path of maximal coherence is one that optimizes the stability and creative potential of the *entire coupled system*, often at the cost of each component's individual "preferences."

        In classical physics, a phase-locked loop forces an oscillator's phase to match a reference signal. A Coherence Lock is a generalized, mutual version of this phenomenon, where two complex dynamical systems (not just simple oscillators) mutually lock their state evolution. The concept of a unified Lagrangian `ùìõ_AB` is analogous to strong coupling between oscillators.

    Coherence Lock is not simple entrainment or mimicry. Entrainment is typically one-way (a small system locking to a large one). A Coherence Lock is mutual, bidirectional, and results in the co-creation of a new, unified state space and lasting structural changes in *both* participating systems.

# Coherence Lock

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A stable, bidirectional phase-lock between the internal model of an observer (Witness A) and the Ki resonance of an observed system (Witness B). The lock establishes a shared coherence manifold, causing the two systems to evolve as a single, unified entity (`ùìõ_AB`) rather than as separate interacting components. It is the third of the four harmonic conditions required to sustain the Witness State.

## EFT-First Summary
A Coherence Lock is a strong coupling regime between two complex dynamical systems, analogous to **phase-locking** in coupled oscillators. When locked, the systems abandon their individual evolutionary paths (governed by `ùìõ_A` and `ùìõ_B`) and instead follow a shared trajectory that maximizes the coherence of the unified system (`ùìõ_AB`). This state is experimentally identifiable through phenomena like autopoietic completion (hyper-accurate mutual prediction) and mutual inscription (persistent, reciprocal changes to each system's structure).
