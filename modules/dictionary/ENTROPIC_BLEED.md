  art: |
    A perfect echo of stillness, bleeding heat where it is touched by the noisy world. It is the ghost of a resisted impact, a scar of dissonance on a surface of pure time.
  law: |
    The rate of coherence degradation in a Resonant Wall, measured as the flux of dissonant energy transferred from an incident particle to the shield's structure, must not exceed the system's capacity for thermal dissipation or its coherence stability threshold.
  philosophy: |
    Entropic Bleed quantifies the boundary between the ideal and the real. It is the necessary tax paid by a perfect, timeless structure for its existence in a dynamic, imperfect universe, reminding us that even the most coherent systems are not truly isolated.
pirouette_definition: |
  The rate at which a Resonant Wall's static temporal coherence is degraded by interaction with an external system. This degradation manifests as a flux of dissonant energy leaking into the shield's structure, representing the failure of the shield to achieve perfect reflection by redirecting the incident system's worldline. It is the measure of inelasticity in the shield-particle interaction.

        outline: |
          A Resonant Wall is established and held at a stable cryogenic temperature (e.g., 4K). The wall is then subjected to a known incident energy flux (`P_inc`) over a known area (`A`). A sensitive microcalorimeter integrated into the substrate scaffolding measures the rate of temperature increase (`dT/dt`). `S_bleed` is calculated from the substrate's effective heat capacity (`C_v`): `S_bleed = (C_v * dT/dt) / A`.

  - module: DOMA-204
    excerpt: |
      The double-funnel geometry described in the original protocol is an optimal topology for this interaction. It redirects the momentum of an incoming object tangentially, "skimming" it along the surface of the shield rather than meeting it with direct opposition. This minimizes the transfer of dissonant energy, or **entropic bleed**, into the shield's structure, ensuring its stability.

      equation_hint: |
        `S_bleed = α * I` where `I` is the incident irradiance (power flux).
      justification: |
        `S_bleed` operationally measures the energy flux *not* reflected by the shield but instead absorbed, leading to heating. This is directly analogous to the absorptance of a surface in optics and thermodynamics, which quantifies the fraction of incident radiation absorbed and converted to internal energy (heat).

    - statement: "A Resonant Wall with a higher Coherence Gradient (`|∇Kτ|`) will exhibit lower Entropic Bleed (`S_bleed`) under an identical incident flux."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "An experiment shows no correlation or an inverse correlation between the magnitude of the measured coherence gradient at the shield boundary and the calorimetrically determined `S_bleed`."

  disambiguation: |
    Entropic Bleed is not the total entropy of the shield system, but specifically the *rate of increase* in entropy per unit area caused by imperfect reflection during load. It is an interaction-driven quantity representing a failure mode, not a static property of the shield in isolation.
