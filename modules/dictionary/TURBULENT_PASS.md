triad:
  art: |
    To study the storm, one must first discard the calm sea. A Turbulent Pass is a net designed to catch only lightning, isolating moments of catastrophic failure or profound creation for focused analysis.
  law: |
    A Turbulent Pass is a filtering operation that retains only those data segments whose local Temporal Pressure (Γ) exceeds a defined lower threshold (Γ_low), discarding all segments where Γ < Γ_low.
  philosophy: |
    The framework values not just order but the dynamics of its breakdown. A Turbulent Pass privileges moments of high dissonance, treating system failure, novelty, and phase transition not as errors to be discarded, but as primary objects of study.
pirouette_definition: |
  A filtering principle of the Coherence Sieve that isolates and retains only segments of a data stream exhibiting high dissonance or "turbulent flow." It operates by selecting for regions where a system's internal coherence (Kτ) is overwhelmed by local Temporal Pressure (VΓ), making it an instrument for identifying and studying moments of chaos, system failure, phase transitions, or profound novelty.

        outline: |
          1. **Segmentation:** Divide the input data stream into discrete, uniform segments.
          2. **Quantification:** For each segment, calculate its local Temporal Pressure (Γ), typically using Shannon Entropy as a proxy.
          3. **Sieving:** For each segment, compare its Γ to the threshold Γ_low. If Γ ≥ Γ_low, retain the segment. Otherwise, discard it.
          4. **Output:** Concatenate the retained segments to form the new, turbulence-isolated data stream.
        expected_signals: [Spiky, high-variance, intermittent data streams corresponding to anomalies, bursts, or failures.]
        pitfalls: [Threshold (Γ_low) misspecification, leading to false negatives (missing true turbulence) or false positives (including structured high-variance noise)., Segmentation window size being too large or small, smearing or missing turbulent events.]

    excerpt: |
      A **Turbulent Pass** selects for "temporal forges"—regions of extreme temporal pressure (`V_Γ`) or systems failing to maintain coherence (`K_τ`). These are zones of turbulence where systems are struggling to find a stable path. This is where we find anomalies, state transitions, and profound novelty.
  - module: DOMA-129
    excerpt: |
      A *Turbulent Pass* acts as a "fever detector," identifying moments of extreme turbulence (`Coherence Fever` from `DYNA-003`) in a system's data stream, flagging them as anomalies that require investigation.
  - module: DOMA-129
    excerpt: |
      A *Turbulent Pass* can isolate the novel, high-information-content words and phrases that carry the core message.

      equation_hint: |
        Output = {segment | AnomalyScore(segment) ≥ Threshold}
      justification: |
        Operationally, a Turbulent Pass is equivalent to a simple anomaly detection algorithm. It computes a score for each segment (the "anomaly score" is Γ) and retains only those segments whose score exceeds a predefined threshold. It formalizes the intuitive act of "keeping the weird parts."

  disambiguation: |
    A Turbulent Pass must be distinguished from a spectral high-pass filter used in signal processing. A high-pass filter operates on the frequency domain of a signal, whereas a Turbulent Pass operates on a statistical property (dissonance, Γ) calculated over a time-domain segment. A signal can be low-frequency but highly turbulent (e.g., erratic, slow state changes), or high-frequency but highly laminar (e.g., a perfect sine wave).
