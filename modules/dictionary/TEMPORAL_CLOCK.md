  art: |
    The Temporal Clock provides the scalar rhythm, a simple phase rotation against which the richer, non-Abelian triad measures its own evolution. It is the steady metronome of the temporal substrate.
  law: |
    The stiffness of the Temporal Clock, `K₁ = 1/g'²`, determines the energy cost of U(1)ᵧ field curvature and, in ratio with the Triad stiffness `K₂`, sets the electroweak mixing angle `sin²θ_W` at the coherence scale.
  philosophy: |
    A non-Abelian frame (the Triad) cannot define its own evolution without a reference. The Temporal Clock provides the minimal, irreducible external reference frame, turning internal SU(2)ₗ geometry into measurable, broken electroweak dynamics.
pirouette_definition: |
  The U(1)ᵧ dynamical gauge frame that forms the Abelian component of the temporal substrate, partnered with the non-Abelian Temporal Triad (SU(2)ₗ). It is characterized by a dynamical stiffness `K₁` which is inversely proportional to the square of its gauge coupling, `g'`. The Higgs field acts as an order parameter measuring the alignment between the Temporal Clock and the Temporal Triad, and the breaking of this alignment symmetry gives rise to the electroweak force structure.

        outline: |
          Measure cross-sections, decay rates, and asymmetries in electroweak processes (e.g., Z-pole observables at LEP/FCC-ee, Drell-Yan at LHC). These observables depend directly on the U(1)ᵧ coupling `g'`. Infer the clock stiffness via the relation `K₁ = 1/g'²`. The weak mixing angle provides a cross-check via the stiffness ratio `tan²θ_W = K₂/K₁`.

        The module explicitly uses the U(1)ᵧ gauge group, coupling g', and gauge field B_μ with the standard hypercharge assignments and covariant derivative structure of the Standard Model. The Pirouette concept of "clock stiffness" `K₁` is directly and quantitatively mapped to the inverse squared gauge coupling `1/g'²`, making the correspondence operationally exact.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'Temporal Clock' specifically refers to the U(1)ᵧ dynamical gauge frame, one of two core components of the temporal substrate. It is distinct from the global time coordinate `t` and the Temporal Pressure field `Γ`. It is the direct precursor to the SM hypercharge group, not electromagnetism.

# Temporal Clock

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Temporal Clock is the U(1)<sub>Y</sub> dynamical gauge frame that forms the Abelian component of the temporal substrate, partnered with the non-Abelian Temporal Triad (SU(2)<sub>L</sub>). It is characterized by a dynamical stiffness `K₁` which is inversely proportional to the square of its gauge coupling, `g'`. The Higgs field acts as an order parameter measuring the alignment between the Temporal Clock and the Temporal Triad, and the breaking of this alignment symmetry gives rise to the electroweak force structure.

## EFT-First Summary
The Temporal Clock is the Pirouette Framework's physical interpretation of the Standard Model's U(1)<sub>Y</sub> hypercharge gauge group. Its gauge field is the `B_μ` boson, its coupling strength is `g'`, and its "stiffness"—a core Pirouette concept representing the energy cost of field curvature—is operationally defined as `K₁ = 1/g'²`. All experimental constraints on weak hypercharge from electroweak precision tests are direct measurements of the properties of the Temporal Clock.
