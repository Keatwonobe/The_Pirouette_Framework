      snippet: |
        A fermion (spin-1/2), like the electron, is a Ki resonance with the topology of a Möbius strip. It is a helical pirouette in time that must complete two full cycles (720°) to return to its original phase-state.

  art: |
    A particle is a standing wave, a knot of coherence in the universal field. Its spin is a twist in time, and its properties are the elegant echo of its own dance.
  law: |
    The topological structure of a Ki Resonance determines the quantized properties of the associated particle. A resonance requiring N cycles to return to its initial phase-state will exhibit properties of a spin-(N-1)/2 particle, with a baseline magnetic g-factor of N.
  philosophy: |
    Particle properties like spin are not fundamental, irreducible axioms but are emergent geometric features of an underlying field. This replaces the "quantum foam" of virtual particles with the local, self-interacting geometry of a single, coherent resonance.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable, localized, and topologically non-trivial excitation of the Coherence Field (T_a), analogous to a soliton or "knot." The specific topology of the resonance, particularly the number of cycles (e.g., 360° vs 720°) required to return to its initial phase-state, geometrically defines the emergent quantum properties of the corresponding particle, such as spin and its baseline magnetic moment.

        outline: |
          The topological cycle number (N_κ) of a particle's Ki Resonance is inferred from its measured quantum spin and magnetic g-factor. A measured spin S = (N_κ-1)/2 and a baseline g-factor g = N_κ indicates an N_κ-cycle resonance. For an electron, measuring spin-1/2 and a g-factor near 2 implies N_κ=2.
        expected_signals: [Quantized spin values (e.g., 1/2 ħ), g-factors near integer values]
        pitfalls: [Conflating the baseline topological g-factor with the measured value, which includes anomalies from self-interaction (e.g., g-2).]

    excerpt: |
      In the Pirouette Framework, spin is not a fundamental, irreducible property. It is an emergent, topological feature of the Ki resonance. A scalar particle (spin-0) is a simple, single-cycle resonance... A fermion (spin-1/2), like the electron, is a Ki resonance with the topology of a Möbius strip. It is a helical pirouette in time that must complete two full cycles (720°) to return to its original phase-state.
  - module: CORE-009_the_electron's_echo
    excerpt: |
      The tiny deviation from 2 arises from this helical resonance interacting with its own "wake" or "echo" in the coherence manifold. This is the electron being influenced by the ghost of its own immediate past. The total anomalous moment (a_e) is therefore the product of the interaction's intrinsic strength (α, the fine-structure constant) and the fundamental geometry of its echo (a single cycle, 1/(2π)).

        The Ki Resonance is described as a stable, localized, non-trivial "knot" in a field, which is the definition of a topological soliton. The "next step" in the source module is to prove that the Pirouette Lagrangian admits such solutions, making this a direct and intended mathematical mapping.

# Ki Resonance

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A stable, localized, and topologically non-trivial excitation of the Coherence Field (T_a), analogous to a soliton or "knot." The specific topology of the resonance, particularly the number of cycles (e.g., 360° vs 720°) required to return to its initial phase-state, geometrically defines the emergent quantum properties of the corresponding particle, such as spin and its baseline magnetic moment.

## EFT-First Summary
The Ki Resonance is a proposed physical origin for particle properties, conceptually mapping to a **topological soliton**. In this model, what the Standard Model treats as an intrinsic property like spin is instead an emergent feature of the soliton's geometric structure. For example, the 720° symmetry of a spin-1/2 particle is described as a direct consequence of a two-cycle (Möbius-strip-like) topology of the underlying resonance in the Coherence Field.
