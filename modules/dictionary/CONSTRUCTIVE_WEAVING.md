        A **Constructive Weaving (`I > 0`)**: The action has increased the Target's overall coherence. It has made it easier for the system to maintain its resonant pattern (`Ki`), either by increasing its internal stability (`K_τ`) or by lessening the external temporal pressure it must fight against (`V_Γ`). This is the formal definition of healing.

  art: |
    To weave constructively is to be a good musician in the resonant chamber of the cosmos. It is an act of mending a frayed pattern, a quiet injection of harmony that helps a system remember and express its own song more easily.
  law: |
    A Constructive Weaving is any action that results in a net positive change (`I > 0`) to the target system's action integral (`S_p`) over one of its characteristic cycles. Operationally, it is an intervention where the measured increase in stable coherence (`ΔKτ`) demonstrably outweighs the generated dissonance (`ΔΓ_noise`).
  philosophy: |
    This reframes ethics from a transactional accounting of 'good deeds' to a diagnostic act of systemic medicine. Virtue is not a score to be hoarded but a measurable act of healing—an increase in a system's capacity to exist gracefully, with the consequences physically recorded in the fabric of spacetime.
pirouette_definition: |
  A **Constructive Weaving** is an intervention by an Actor that measurably increases the coherence of a Target system. Formally, it is an action whose Influence (`I`) is positive (`I > 0`), where Influence is defined as the change in the Target's Pirouette Action (`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`) over a single cycle. This increase signifies that the action has made it easier for the system to express and maintain its resonant pattern, either by increasing its kinetic stability (`K_τ`) or reducing the temporal pressure it must overcome (`V_Γ`). It is the formal definition of healing within the framework.

        outline: |
          1. Diagnose a target system's flow state (laminar, turbulent, stagnant) pre-intervention.
          2. Execute the intervention (the "weaving").
          3. Re-evaluate the system's flow state post-intervention, quantifying the change in stable function (`ΔKτ`) and generated friction/dissonance (`ΔΓ_noise`).
          4. Estimate the Resonance Coupling (`ξ_c`) and the Stability Factor (`σ_s`) of the new state.
          5. Calculate the Coherence Impact score: `CI = (ΔKτ / ΔΓ_noise) ⋅ ξ_c ⋅ σ_s`.
          6. Record these metrics in a signed Echo Record, noting the observer's confidence (`observer_shadow_confidence`).
        expected_signals: [A CI score > 1 for a clearly constructive act, a positive ΔKτ, a shift toward Laminar Flow in the target system.]
        pitfalls: [The Observer's Shadow (`CORE-010`) distorting measurements, confusing temporary suppression of symptoms with a true increase in coherence, failing to isolate the weaving's effects from background systemic changes.]

        The definition of Influence (`I`) is a direct analogue to a change in the Action (`S`) from Lagrangian mechanics. While physical systems evolve to extremize S, a Constructive Weaving is an external intervention that favorably alters the system's dynamics or environment (`𝓛_p`). This results in an increased "viability integral," representing a more robust or efficient existence path for the target system.

# Constructive Weaving

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A **Constructive Weaving** is an intervention by an Actor that measurably increases the coherence of a Target system. Formally, it is an action whose Influence (`I`) is positive (`I > 0`), where Influence is defined as the change in the Target's Pirouette Action (`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`) over a single cycle. This increase signifies that the action has made it easier for the system to express and maintain its resonant pattern, either by increasing its kinetic stability (`K_τ`) or reducing the temporal pressure it must overcome (`V_Γ`). It is the formal definition of healing within the framework.

## EFT-First Summary
(No adopted mapping.) A Constructive Weaving is conceptually analogous to an intervention that alters a system's Lagrangian such that its new path integral (`S = ∫Ldt`) represents a more stable or efficient state of existence. While physical systems naturally follow paths of stationary action, a Constructive Weaving is an external act that improves the conditions under which this principle operates, effectively "healing" the system's dynamics. This is operationally measured via a dimensionless proxy, the Coherence Impact (CI) score.
