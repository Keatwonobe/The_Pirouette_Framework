    The organs of the body politic, tuning the societal song towards either the dissonance of conflict or the harmony of collaboration. They are the focusing lenses through which a civilization's potential is either scattered or brought to a coherent point.
  law: |
    The function of a Civic Resonator is to shape the potential field (V_Œì) of the Civic Manifold, determining the paths of least action for its citizens and amplifying societal tendencies toward either high coherence (Creative Resonance) or high entropy (Extractive Resonance).
  philosophy: |
    Civic Resonators reframe institutions not as static structures of power, but as dynamic, tunable instruments of governance whose primary purpose is to cultivate societal health by aligning individual and collective flourishing. The goal is to design a landscape where virtue is the most efficient path.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Civic Resonator is a core societal institution (e.g., legal system, economic market, media ecosystem, educational framework) that shapes the geometry of the Civic Manifold. These resonators function as amplifiers, selectively reinforcing one of two fundamental frequencies: the Creative Resonance, which generates a Coherence Dividend by facilitating positive-sum interactions, or the Extractive Resonance, which exports entropy by rewarding zero-sum, conflict-driven behavior.

          1.  **Isolate Institution:** Define the boundaries of the resonator to be measured (e.g., the national media ecosystem).
          2.  **Define Currents:** Identify the primary Vital Currents it modulates (e.g., Information, Trust).
          3.  **Establish Metrics:** For each current, define paired metrics for Creative (positive-sum) and Extractive (zero-sum) outcomes. For media: ratio of verified reporting to outrage-driven content. For markets: ratio of R&D investment to stock buybacks. For law: ratio of dispute resolution speed to litigation cost.
          4.  **Calculate Tuning (Œ∂_R):** Compute the normalized difference between Creative and Extractive outcome metrics over a defined period.

        Civic Resonators are analogous to the potential V(q) in a Lagrangian (L = T - V) as they define the landscape of forces and incentives that guide the trajectory of citizens. A resonator tuned to Creative Resonance creates a potential well that favors coherent, low-action paths, while an Extractive resonator creates a chaotic potential that incentivizes high-action, dissipative paths.

# Civic Resonators

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Civic Resonator is a core societal institution (e.g., legal system, economic market, media ecosystem, educational framework) that shapes the geometry of the Civic Manifold. These resonators function as amplifiers, selectively reinforcing one of two fundamental frequencies: the Creative Resonance, which generates a Coherence Dividend by facilitating positive-sum interactions, or the Extractive Resonance, which exports entropy by rewarding zero-sum, conflict-driven behavior.

## EFT-First Summary
Civic Resonators are conceptually mapped to the potential energy term, V(q), in a classical mechanical system. They define the 'landscape' of societal incentives, with a well-tuned resonator creating a potential well that guides actors along paths of collective benefit (laminar flow), while a poorly-tuned one creates a chaotic, high-friction landscape that dissipates social capital (turbulent flow). The health of the system is determined by the geometry of this potential field.
