        An inverted framework would be fundamentally prescriptive or generative. It would restructure the system's dynamics so that actions leading to increased global coherence are the most "natural" and "effortless." It seeks not to prevent accidents, but to make success the system's default state—a Theory of Inevitable Coherence.

triad:
  art: |
    A terraformed landscape where coherence is not forced but flows, carving its own channels so that the path of least resistance naturally waters a flourishing ecosystem. It is a gentle, pervasive field that doesn't command, but guides.
  law: |
    A system's state space possesses a global attractor for coherent dynamics when governed by a prescriptive Lagrangian that sufficiently rewards phase-aligned, coherence-generating actions. The system is structured to make pro-social outcomes the statistically dominant equilibrium.
  philosophy: |
    The conceptual and mathematical inversion of Normal Accident Theory. Rather than designing systems to mitigate inevitable failures, Inevitable Coherence posits that one can design systems where success and resonance are the inevitable, natural equilibrium.
pirouette_definition: |
  A theoretical system property wherein the governing dynamics have been prescriptively altered, typically through a mechanism like the Coherence Dividend ($C_D$), such that the path of least resistance for any actor aligns with actions that increase global system coherence. In this state, pro-social, resonant behavior is not merely incentivized but becomes the system's default emergent behavior, making widespread coherence the natural and stable equilibrium. It transforms complexity from a liability into a source of generative strength.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (describes a system state)
  symbol_table:
    - name: $C_D$
      meaning: Cumulative Coherence Dividend, a measure of an actor's total positive contribution to system coherence.
      dimensions: Context-dependent; often treated as dimensionless "credit".
      default_range: $[0, \infty)$
    - name: $\lambda$
      meaning: Coherence Field constant; strength of the prescriptive influence.
      dimensions: Varies with Lagrangian formulation.
      default_range: Contextual
    - name: $\mathcal{L}_{prescriptive}$
      meaning: The system Lagrangian modified with a term that rewards coherence-generating actions.
      dimensions: Action or Energy
      default_range: N/A
  measurement:
    procedures:
      - name: Phase Space Convergence Test
        outline: |
          1. Initialize a multi-agent simulation governed by $\mathcal{L}_{prescriptive}$ with a non-zero $\lambda$.
          2. Agents begin with random policies or simple heuristics.
          3. Run the simulation over N time steps, tracking the system's trajectory in the state space defined by key coherence metrics (e.g., average $T_a$, system-wide $\Delta \phi$).
          4. A state of Inevitable Coherence is achieved if the system reliably converges to a stable, high-coherence region (a basin of attraction) regardless of initial conditions.
        expected_signals: [Positive and increasing system-wide average $C_D$, Convergence of system state variables to a stable attractor]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking a local minimum for the global attractor, Insufficient simulation time to observe convergence, Conflating forced compliance with natural equilibrium]

    excerpt: |
      By inverting the math, we are no longer just building a dam to hold back the flood of Normal Accidents. We are terraforming the entire landscape, carving channels and creating gradients so that the water naturally flows into a vibrant, life-sustaining reservoir.

        $\dot{x} = f(x)$ where system state $x$ flows towards a fixed point or region $A$ such that $x(0) \in W^s(A) \implies \lim_{t \to \infty} x(t) \in A$.
      justification: |
        The concept of a system's phase space being reshaped so that trajectories naturally flow towards a desired state (high coherence) is a direct parallel to creating a global attractor in a dynamical system. The prescriptive Lagrangian term acts as the vector field $f(x)$ that defines this flow.

  claims:
    - statement: "A system governed by $\mathcal{L}_{prescriptive}$ with a sufficiently strong $\lambda > 0$ will robustly converge to a non-trivial, high-coherence equilibrium state from a wide range of initial conditions."
      domain: theory|phenomenology
      falsifier: "In simulation, the system consistently fails to converge, converges to a trivial state (e.g., all activity ceases), or the 'coherent' state is demonstrated to be unstable to minor perturbations, indicating it is not a robust attractor."

  disambiguation: |
    Inevitable Coherence is not a guarantee of perfect, static order. It describes a dynamic equilibrium where the system naturally and actively *generates* coherence, corrects for perturbations, and makes resonant behavior the path of least resistance. It is an inversion of "Normal Accident," which describes how certain complex systems make catastrophic failure inevitable.
