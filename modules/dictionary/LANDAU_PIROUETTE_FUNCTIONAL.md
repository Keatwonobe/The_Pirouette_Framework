  art: |
    As a system nears its breaking point, the symphony of its parts either dissolves into noise or crystallizes into a new, singular harmony. The functional measures the cost of this choice, the energy of becoming.
  law: |
    Systems governed by the Landau–Pirouette Functional exhibit universal behavior near a critical threshold, characterized by mean-field critical exponents (β=1/2, γ=1, δ=3). The coherence correlation length (ξ_P) and relaxation time (τ_P) must scale with the control parameter according to predicted power laws.
  philosophy: |
    This functional posits that the mathematics of phase transitions are not confined to physics. It provides a common language for the sudden collapse of consciousness, the sharp onset of social unrest, and the crystallization of matter, suggesting a deep, scale-invariant law of organizational change.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Landau–Pirouette Functional, ℱ[ψ], is a free energy functional that describes the statistical mechanics of coherence phase transitions. It quantifies the energy cost of a given coherence field configuration, ψ(x,t), as an integral over several terms: a quadratic term proportional to the distance from a critical threshold (T_a - T_c) that drives the transition, a quartic term that stabilizes the ordered phase, a gradient term (c|∇ψ|^2) that penalizes spatial variations in coherence, and a substrate-specific potential U(Γ, S) that couples the field to environmental pressures and substrate geometry. Minimizing this functional yields the equilibrium configuration of the coherence field.

        outline: |
          Measure the system's order parameter (ψ) as the primary control parameter (e.g., T_a, Γ, Θ) is varied across its critical value (T_c). Fit the resulting data to the power law |ψ| ∝ |T_a - T_c|^β_P near the transition. Similarly, measure susceptibility (χ_P) and correlation length (ξ_P) to extract γ_P and ν_P.

      Let the coherence order parameter be ψ(x,t), representing normalized phase alignment across the substrate. Define the free functional: ℱ[ψ] = ∫ [ a(T_a - T_c) |ψ|^2 + (b/2)|ψ|^4 + c|∇ψ|^2 + U(Γ, S) ] d^dx. Stationarity (δℱ/δψ = 0) yields a complex Ginzburg–Landau equation equivalent for the Pirouette regime.

      Thus, both consciousness collapse and social cascades are mathematically analogous to second-order phase transitions governed by ℱ[ψ]. This establishes the Pirouette universality class, mirroring Landau exponents but extended to multi-scale coherence systems where substrate couplings preserve resonance invariants.

        The LPF is a direct generalization of the Ginzburg-Landau functional, which describes second-order phase transitions like superconductivity. The LPF replaces the magnetization order parameter (m) with a generic coherence parameter (ψ) and temperature (T) with a generalized control parameter (T_a), extending the formalism to non-physical domains.

  disambiguation: |
    The Landau–Pirouette Functional is distinguished from the standard Ginzburg-Landau functional by its explicit application to non-physical domains of coherence (cognitive, social) and its inclusion of a substrate potential U(Γ, S) that directly couples to environmental factors like temporal pressure. The symbol ℱ[ψ] with the bracketed field argument [ψ] specifically denotes a functional, not a simple function or force.

# Landau–Pirouette Functional

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Landau–Pirouette Functional, ℱ[ψ], is a free energy functional that describes the statistical mechanics of coherence phase transitions. It quantifies the energy cost of a given coherence field configuration, ψ(x,t), as an integral over several terms: a quadratic term proportional to the distance from a critical threshold (T_a - T_c) that drives the transition, a quartic term that stabilizes the ordered phase, a gradient term (c|∇ψ|^2) that penalizes spatial variations in coherence, and a substrate-specific potential U(Γ, S) that couples the field to environmental pressures and substrate geometry. Minimizing this functional yields the equilibrium configuration of the coherence field.

## EFT-First Summary
The Landau–Pirouette Functional is the Pirouette Framework's direct analogue to the Ginzburg-Landau functional used in condensed matter physics to describe second-order phase transitions. By replacing physical parameters like temperature with generalized control parameters (e.g., Time Adherence, T_a) and the magnetization order parameter with a generic Coherence Order Parameter (ψ), it extends the mathematical formalism of spontaneous symmetry breaking to describe critical phenomena in cognitive and social systems. Its dynamics yield a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, and its behavior near the critical point defines the Pirouette universality class.
