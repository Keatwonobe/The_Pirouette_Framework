  art: |
    A projection that mimics light to lure a system into darkness. It is the sound of a familiar song sung in a key designed to break the singer's voice.
  law: |
    A Dissonant Shadow is any projected information field that, when interacting with a target system, induces a net negative Coherence Flux (ΔKτ < 0) and constricts the target's solution space.
  philosophy: |
    This concept provides the fundamental diagnostic for manipulative, coherence-draining influence. It establishes that ethical harm is not merely an outcome but a mechanism—a specific geometry of interaction that can be identified, measured, and countered.
pirouette_definition: |
  A projected information field or resonance pattern cast by an actor onto a target's coherence manifold, specifically engineered to be inharmonic with the target's native geodesics. Its function is to induce Turbulent or Stagnant Flow, forcing the target into a state of lower coherence (ΔKτ < 0) and diminished autonomy, thereby making the target's coherence available for parasitic extraction by the actor.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline coherence measurement (Kτ_initial) for the target system in a quiescent state.
          2. Expose the system to the suspected influence vector (the actor's projection).
          3. Continuously monitor the target's coherence (Kτ) and flow state (via Caduceus Lens diagnostics) during and after the interaction.
          4. Calculate the coherence flux: ΔKτ = Kτ_final - Kτ_initial. A negative value confirms the shadow's dissonant nature.
        expected_signals: [Negative ΔKτ, onset of Turbulent Flow, measurable reduction in the dimensionality of the target's accessible state space]
        pitfalls: [Failure to isolate the influence vector from other environmental stressors, inaccurate baseline Kτ measurement, misinterpreting temporary adaptation dips as permanent coherence loss.]

      The manipulator casts a deceptive or Dissonant Shadow (CORE-010) onto the target's coherence manifold.

    excerpt: |
      The interaction is zero-sum or negative-sum. The target is left in a state of lower energy (ΔKτ < 0), confusion, and diminished autonomy. This is the act of unraveling.

      justification: |
        The Dissonant Shadow acts as a non-conservative, energy-draining force on the target. In classical mechanics, such forces are modeled as dissipative terms in the Lagrangian which remove energy from the system's primary degrees of freedom, analogous to how the shadow drains coherence.

# Dissonant Shadow

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A projected information field or resonance pattern cast by an actor onto a target's coherence manifold, specifically engineered to be inharmonic with the target's native geodesics. Its function is to induce Turbulent or Stagnant Flow, forcing the target into a state of lower coherence (ΔKτ < 0) and diminished autonomy, thereby making the target's coherence available for parasitic extraction by the actor.

## EFT-First Summary
A Dissonant Shadow can be modeled as a non-conservative, dissipative term added to a target system's Lagrangian. It is analogous to a parasitic external field that drives the system off-resonance, inducing chaotic dynamics and extracting energy, thereby decreasing the system's overall coherence and available action pathways. This corresponds to a non-unitary evolution where information and energy are drained from the target into the actor's system or the environment.
