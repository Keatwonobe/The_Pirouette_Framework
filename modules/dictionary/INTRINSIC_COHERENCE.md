    The unwavering hum of a flawless crystal, a stability born not of strength, but of indivisibility. It is the architectural integrity of a system that cannot be factored into smaller, warring parts.
  law: |
    The intrinsic coherence κ(p) is a dimensionless coefficient quantifying the baseline resilience of a system with a prime number `p` of stable states. For a given scale, κ(p) is a non-increasing function for p > 3.
  philosophy: |
    Intrinsic coherence posits that true stability is a topological property of wholeness, not an aggregate of component strengths. A system is most resilient when its fundamental structure is irreducible, forcing any perturbation to contend with the entire entity at once.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dimensionless coefficient, κ(p), representing the fundamental, irreducible stability contribution of a prime-p system configuration. It quantifies the inherent resilience a system gains from having a prime number (`p`) of stable coherence modes, reflecting its topological indivisibility and lack of harmonic failure modes. This value serves as the foundational input for calculating the Coherence Integrity (Λ) of any system, prime or composite.

          1. Identify a system with a known, prime number (`p`) of observable stable states (coherence modes).
          2. Measure its overall Coherence Integrity, `Λ(p)`, by applying broad-spectrum temporal pressure (`Γ`) and observing the decoherence threshold `Γ_crit`, where `Λ(p) ∝ Γ_crit`.
          3. Use the simplified formula for prime systems, `Λ(p) = κ(p)/p`.
          4. Invert the formula to calculate the intrinsic coherence: `κ(p) = p * Λ(p)`.
          5. Repeat for systems with different prime mode counts (`p'`) to build an empirical table of `κ(p)` values.

    excerpt: |
      A system with a prime number of modes is topologically irreducible. It is a "monolithic" entity, a single, flawless crystal. It has no simpler sub-symmetries or harmonic fracture planes that can be independently excited. To perturb the system, one must perturb the *entire system* at once. This holistic entanglement provides a powerful, broad-spectrum resistance to a wide variety of temporal pressures.

      justification: |
        The intrinsic coherence κ(p) is analogous to the energy gap above the ground state in a gapped quantum system. A larger gap (larger κ) implies greater stability, as more energy is required to excite the system out of its stable configuration. The irreducibility of a prime-p system is conceptually similar to a system with a non-degenerate ground state protected by a large gap from low-lying excitations.

    Distinguish from Coherence Integrity (Λ). κ(p) is the *potential* or *intrinsic* stability of a prime-p architecture, a theoretical coefficient. Λ is the *calculated* structural resilience of a *specific* system (prime or composite), which incorporates penalties for complexity based on all its prime factors.

# Intrinsic Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A dimensionless coefficient, κ(p), representing the fundamental, irreducible stability contribution of a prime-p system configuration. It quantifies the inherent resilience a system gains from having a prime number (`p`) of stable coherence modes, reflecting its topological indivisibility and lack of harmonic failure modes. This value serves as the foundational input for calculating the Coherence Integrity (Λ) of any system, prime or composite.

## EFT-First Summary
No formal mapping has been adopted. A conceptual candidate is the ground state energy gap (ΔE) in condensed matter systems. In this analogy, κ(p) represents the system's inherent resistance to perturbation, where a larger κ(p) implies a more robust and stable configuration, much like a larger energy gap protects a quantum ground state from thermal or quantum fluctuations.
