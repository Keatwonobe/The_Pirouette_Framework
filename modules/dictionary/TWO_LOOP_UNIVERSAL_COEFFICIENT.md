    A particle's path, subtly warped by its own quantum echo. This is the second ripple in the vacuum's self-correction, a geometric whisper that twists the particle's future from the memory of its past.
  law: |
    In the Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) limit, the universal two-loop coefficient C₂ in the expansion of the lepton anomalous magnetic moment, `a_ℓ = Σ C_n (α/π)^n`, is a positive constant, `C₂ = +0.328478965...`. Any verified deviation from this value signals new physics beyond QED or an incorrect renormalization scheme.
  philosophy: |
    C₂ codifies the first universal, non-trivial self-interaction correction to a particle's electromagnetic identity. By isolating this QED baseline, the framework strictly separates universal geometry (the unchanging stage) from Pirouette-specific dynamics (the pressuron-driven performance), ensuring that new physics is not conflated with established quantum field theory.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Two-Loop Universal Coefficient, C₂, is the second-order, dimensionless constant in the universal expansion of a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment. Geometrically, it represents the leading curvature correction to a particle's worldtube, arising from the interplay between vacuum polarization (the medium's response) and vertex corrections (local twists), as captured by the wound-channel geometric recursion.

        This is not an analogy but a direct adoption of a foundational QED constant. C₂ is the standard, universal coefficient of the `(α/π)²` term in the perturbative QED calculation of `g-2`, independent of lepton mass. The Pirouette Framework uses C₂ as a universal baseline to precisely isolate non-QED or framework-specific effects (`Δa_ℓ^(Γ)`).

# Two-Loop Universal Coefficient

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Two-Loop Universal Coefficient, C₂, is the second-order, dimensionless constant in the universal expansion of a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment. Geometrically, it represents the leading curvature correction to a particle's worldtube, arising from the interplay between vacuum polarization (the medium's response) and vertex corrections (local twists), as captured by the wound-channel geometric recursion.

## EFT-First Summary
The Two-Loop Universal Coefficient `C₂` is the standard QED coefficient for the fourth-order (`(α/π)²`) contribution to the lepton anomalous magnetic moment, `(g-2)_ℓ`. Its precisely calculated value, `+0.328478965...`, serves as a universal baseline in the Pirouette Framework for isolating new physics. It was first calculated by Petermann and Sommerfield in 1957.
