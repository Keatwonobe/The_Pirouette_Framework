    The silent hum of aligned crystal lattices versus the roaring chaos of a star's furnace. It is the distinction between a laser's focused beam and the diffuse glow of a candle.

    The degree of correlation among a system's constituent parts determines its capacity for directed work and information storage. Maximal alignment (χ → +1) corresponds to minimal internal entropy, while maximal randomness (χ → -1) corresponds to maximal entropy.
  philosophy: |
    Cohesion quantifies the fundamental tension between information and noise, structure and dissolution. It frames the Second Law of Thermodynamics not as a pessimistic fate, but as one pole of a dynamic axis upon which systems, from particles to societies, must orient themselves.

        outline: |
          1. Identify the relevant state variables for the system's components (e.g., spin, momentum, position).
          2. Measure the two-point (or higher-order) correlation function for these variables across the system's volume or ensemble.
          3. Normalize the integrated correlation strength against the theoretical maximum for a perfectly ordered system. A value near 1 indicates high Alignment; a value near 0 indicates randomness. Map to the [-1, +1] range.
        expected_signals: [Bragg peaks in diffraction patterns, long-range spin-spin correlation, phase coherence in electromagnetic fields.]
        pitfalls: [Scale-dependence (a system can be ordered locally but chaotic globally), mistaking complex deterministic chaos for true randomness.]

      justification: |
        The Random Pole is explicitly identified with entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Cohesion therefore acts as a measure of negentropy, or the degree of order and information encoded in a system's microstates. A maximally entropic state (e.g., thermal equilibrium) corresponds to minimal Cohesion.

  disambiguation: |
    Cohesion in Pirouette refers to *internal order and correlation* of a system's parts. This is distinct from the common physics/chemistry usage referring to intermolecular attractive forces that make a substance stick together (e.g., surface tension). A gas has low Cohesion in both senses, but a crystal has high Pirouette-Cohesion (ordered) while its material cohesion (hardness) is a separate property.

# Cohesion

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Cohesion is a fundamental axis of the Behavioral Triad describing the degree of internal ordering of a system's components and their dynamics. The spectrum ranges from the Aligned Pole (χ = +1), where components act in a coherent, correlated manner, to the Random Pole (χ = -1), where components act in a disordered, uncorrelated, or chaotic manner. It is a measure of a system's internal information content versus its internal noise.

## EFT-First Summary
Cohesion (χ) is conceptually and inversely proportional to thermodynamic entropy (S). A system at the Aligned Pole, such as a perfect crystal at absolute zero or a laser beam, represents a state of minimal entropy (χ → +1). Conversely, a system at the Random Pole, such as a gas at thermal equilibrium or turbulent fluid, represents a state of maximal entropy (χ → -1). Cohesion can be viewed as the system's negentropy, quantifying the information encoded in the correlation of its microstates.
