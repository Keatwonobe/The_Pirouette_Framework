  art: |
    A model’s worth is not in its beauty, but in the sharpness of the empirical knife it offers to its own throat. These targets are that knife's edge, where theory meets its verdict.
  law: |
    A pre-registered, quantitative test derived from a model's frozen parameters that, if failed, invalidates the model or its specified domain of applicability. The test must reference a specific observational dataset (e.g., Planck CMB power spectra, primordial abundances) and a pre-defined statistical threshold for inconsistency.
  philosophy: |
    To enforce Popperian rigor within the Pirouette Framework, ensuring that models are not just descriptive but predictive and vulnerable to empirical reality. Falsifiable targets prevent post-hoc parameter tuning and anchor theoretical development to measurable phenomena.
pirouette_definition: |
  A set of pre-defined, quantitative observational tests against which a model's predictions are compared for the purpose of empirical validation or invalidation. These targets are derived from a model's frozen parameter set (the 'one-shot anchor') without re-tuning. Failure to meet a target's specified consistency threshold (e.g., for BBN yields, CMB spectra, or structure formation observables) constitutes a falsification of the model baseline.

          1. Freeze the model's fundamental parameters (e.g., Γ-field potential `V(Γ)`) via a `one-shot anchor`.
          2. Evolve the background cosmology to the BBN epoch (z ~ 10⁹) and compute the effective number of relativistic species, ΔN_eff, from the model's dynamics.
          3. Input this ΔN_eff into a standard BBN code (e.g., PArthENoPE) to compute primordial light-element abundances (D/H, Y_p).
          4. Compare computed abundances to observational constraints from QSO absorption lines and extragalactic HII regions. Rejection occurs if predictions lie outside the N-σ confidence region of the data.

          1. Using the same frozen parameter set, evolve the model's background and perturbation equations through recombination (z ~ 1100).
          2. Use a modified Boltzmann code (e.g., a CLASS/CAMB branch) to compute the TT, TE, EE, and lensing angular power spectra.
          3. Compare the computed spectra against cosmological data (e.g., Planck legacy release) using a formal likelihood analysis (e.g., AIC/BIC comparison against ΛCDM).

      justification: |
        The Pirouette concept of 'Falsifiable Targets' is a direct operationalization of Karl Popper's principle that a scientific theory must be empirically refutable. By requiring pre-registered, quantitative tests against data, the framework enforces this principle programmatically, preventing unfalsifiable models that can be endlessly adjusted post-hoc.

    Distinguish from a 'goodness-of-fit' metric. A Falsifiable Target is not just a measure of fit, but a pre-registered binary test: if the model's prediction falls outside a specified threshold relative to the target data, the model is rejected, not merely disfavored.

# Falsifiable Targets

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A set of pre-defined, quantitative observational tests against which a model's predictions are compared for the purpose of empirical validation or invalidation. These targets are derived from a model's frozen parameter set (the 'one-shot anchor') without re-tuning. Failure to meet a target's specified consistency threshold (e.g., for BBN yields, CMB spectra, or structure formation observables) constitutes a falsification of the model baseline.

## EFT-First Summary
In the philosophy of science, the concept is an operationalization of Karl Popper's falsifiability criterion. It mandates that any valid physical model must make specific, testable predictions that could, in principle, be contradicted by empirical data. Within the Pirouette Framework, this is enforced by requiring modules to declare quantitative tests against datasets like Big Bang Nucleosynthesis abundances or Cosmic Microwave Background power spectra, with pre-defined thresholds for model rejection.
