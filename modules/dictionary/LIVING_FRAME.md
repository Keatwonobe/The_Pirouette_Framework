    A team is not a clockwork machine to be assembled, but a garden to be cultivated. The Living Frame is the blueprint for this garden, a commonwealth of functions that grows into a resilient, living system. It learns to sing in harmony with the laws of its environment.
  law: |
    A 7-person team structured with 1 Membrane, 1 Sensorium, 3 Crucible, and 2 Catalyst roles is a stable, low-energy solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = KœÑ - V_Œì). This configuration maximizes internal coherence (KœÑ) and minimizes dissipative losses from environmental pressure (V_Œì), naturally sustaining Laminar Flow.
  philosophy: |
    The most effective organizational structures are not imposed by managerial fiat but are emergent solutions to fundamental physical principles. The Living Frame replaces the fragile, static blueprint of a hierarchy with the resilient, adaptive anatomy of an organism. Its purpose is to create the conditions for coherence, allowing the team to find its own elegant, autopoietic path.
pirouette_definition: |
  A 7-person team structured as an autopoietic, living system to maximize performance according to the Principle of Maximal Coherence. Its structure is not a hierarchy of titles but an interdependent set of four core functions‚ÄîMembrane (1x, interface), Sensorium (1x, feedback), Crucible (3x, core production), and Catalyst (2x, resilience/adaptation)‚Äîthat form a single, self-regulating 'Coherent Engine'. This configuration is a proven, stable Ki pattern for transforming environmental pressure (Œì) into coherent value.

          1. Map the 7 team members to the four primary functions (Membrane, Sensorium, Crucible, Catalyst) based on their actual day-to-day activities and communication patterns, irrespective of job titles.
          2. Analyze communication and workflow data (e.g., ticket system, comms channels) to verify that value flows along the Pirouette Cycle.
          3. Measure the team's internal coherence (KœÑ) via metrics like throughput, quality, and cycle time stability.
          4. A successful implementation will show the 1-1-3-2 role distribution and high, stable KœÑ metrics.

      The seven roles of the engine are not job titles; they are the fundamental functions required for any collaborative system to maintain coherence. They are the organs of a single living body. The Membrane manages the boundary, the Sensorium provides feedback, the Crucible performs value creation, and the Catalyst ensures resilience and adaptation.

        The Living Frame's 7-person structure (1-1-3-2) is posited as a uniquely stable and efficient configuration for a human collaborative system. This is analogous to "magic numbers" in nuclear physics, where atomic nuclei with specific numbers of nucleons exhibit unusually high stability and binding energy. The Frame represents a deep potential-energy well in the configuration space of team structures.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'Frame' specifically refers to the *Living Frame*, the 7-person autopoietic team structure. It is distinct from a 'frame of reference' (a coordinate system) or a static 'framework'. The modifier 'Living' emphasizes its biological, adaptive, and self-regulating nature.

# Living Frame

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A 7-person team structured as an autopoietic, living system to maximize performance according to the Principle of Maximal Coherence. Its structure is not a hierarchy of titles but an interdependent set of four core functions‚ÄîMembrane (1x, interface), Sensorium (1x, feedback), Crucible (3x, core production), and Catalyst (2x, resilience/adaptation)‚Äîthat form a single, self-regulating 'Coherent Engine'. This configuration is a proven, stable Ki pattern for transforming environmental pressure (Œì) into coherent value.

## EFT-First Summary
No direct mapping to an effective field theory has been adopted. The Living Frame is best understood conceptually as an organizational analogue to stable configurations in physics, such as molecules or "magic number" nuclei, which represent local minima in a potential energy landscape. The 7-person structure is hypothesized to be such a minimum for a team seeking to maximize its coherence against environmental pressure.
