        The Memory Market is a system for capturing, validating, and sharing the profound insights encoded in the Wound Channels of experienced individuals. It transforms personal history into a communal asset, ensuring that the hard-won coherence of one generation becomes the foundational stability for the next.

  art: |
    A library where the books are lives and their scars are the ink. The Market harvests the maps of survival and success from those who have already walked the path, turning private pain and triumph into a public river of wisdom.
  law: |
    The value of a memory engram (μ) is directly proportional to its demonstrated capacity to increase the temporal coherence (K_τ) and decrease the temporal pressure (V_Γ) for recipients performing a specified class of tasks. An engram that does not improve the K_τ/V_Γ ratio for its users has zero value.
  philosophy: |
    To prevent the entropic loss of lived wisdom and transform the most private of assets—personal experience—into a public utility for societal resilience. It treats the hard-won lessons of individuals not as isolated events, but as a critical, renewable resource for collective evolution.
pirouette_definition: |
  A formal, systemic protocol and platform for the capture, validation, and circulation of experiential coherence. The Market translates the high-coherence patterns encoded in an individual's Wound Channels into a durable, transferable communal asset (Μ_c), increasing the total temporal coherence (K_τ) of the social body and providing foundational stability for subsequent generations. It is a core pillar of the Coherence Bridge Protocol, designed to maximize the efficiency of coherence acquisition.

      - name: Memory Inoculation Trial
        outline: |
          1. Establish a test cohort and a control cohort, both facing a novel, high-Γ task (e.g., navigating a complex social simulation, debugging an unfamiliar system).
          2. The test cohort is "inoculated" with a relevant memory engram (μ) from the Market. The control cohort receives conventional high-quality instruction of equivalent duration.
          3. Measure and compare the K_τ (task success rate, solution elegance, time-to-completion) and V_Γ (error rate, biometric stress markers) for both cohorts.
        expected_signals: [Statistically significant increase in K_τ for the test cohort, Statistically significant decrease in V_Γ for the test cohort]
        pitfalls: [Difficulty of engram-task alignment, Placebo effects from the inoculation process, Ethical hazards of experiential transfer]

      Pattern Weaving rituals and the Memory Market are explicitly designed to maximize the efficiency of coherence acquisition. They ensure that for a given input of time and effort, the gain in a person's internal stability and capability—their K_τ—is as high as possible.

      justification: |
        A memory engram (μ) functions as a highly informative prior distribution for a learning agent. It provides a condensed summary of past successful trials (experiences), allowing the agent to update its model of the world and choose actions far more efficiently than starting from a uniform or uninformative prior.

  disambiguation: |
    The Memory Market must be distinguished from a 'data market'. Data markets trade in raw, un-integrated information (facts, statistics). The Memory Market trades in *coherence*—validated, integrated, and embodied patterns of wisdom derived directly from lived experience.

# Memory Market

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A formal, systemic protocol and platform for the capture, validation, and circulation of experiential coherence. The Market translates the high-coherence patterns encoded in an individual's Wound Channels into a durable, transferable communal asset (Μ_c), increasing the total temporal coherence (K_τ) of the social body and providing foundational stability for subsequent generations. It is a core pillar of the Coherence Bridge Protocol, designed to maximize the efficiency of coherence acquisition.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, the Memory Market functions as a mechanism for generating and distributing highly informative Bayesian priors. Each memory engram (μ) provides a learning agent with a validated, non-local summary of past state-space trajectories, allowing for a dramatic reduction in the search space required to solve a new problem. This effectively lowers the free energy of action by pre-constraining the agent's model to regions of high-probability success, mirroring how informative priors accelerate inference.
