        The Sentinel functions as a real-time measurement of "Lagrangian Stress." The `V_drift` vector is a proxy for the "acceleration" of the system away from its geodesic—its optimal, maximally coherent path. The CII, therefore, quantifies the degree to which a system's current state is failing to be an elegant solution to the pressures of its existence. It measures the tension building up before the system is forced to snap into a new configuration.

  art: |
    The tension in a violin string pulled just shy of its breaking point. It is the stored potential for change, the silent strain a system endures as it deviates from its true path, whispering of the sharp, resonant snap to come.
  law: |
    Lagrangian Stress is the potential for a state transition that accumulates when a system's trajectory deviates from its geodesic. It is operationally measured by the Coherence Inflection Index (CII), where a sustained value > 0.6 indicates an imminent state transition.
  philosophy: |
    This concept operationalizes the Pirouette Lagrangian, transforming an abstract principle of coherence into a predictive, measurable quantity. It asserts that crises are not sudden events but the release of accumulated tension, making foresight and graceful intervention possible.
pirouette_definition: |
  The potential for state transition that arises within a system when its evolution deviates from its geodesic—the path of maximal coherence defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). It is the unforced, internal pressure for change, quantified as the degree to which the system's current state fails to be an optimal solution to the ambient Temporal Pressure.

        outline: |
          1.  **Resonance Mapping:** Ingest time-series data to extract the system's dominant resonant signature (`Ki`).
          2.  **Drift Calculation:** Calculate the rate of change of `Ki` over time to determine the Manifold Drift Vector (`V_drift`).
          3.  **Normalization:** Calculate the Coherence Inflection Index (CII) by normalizing the magnitude of `V_drift` against the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) using the formula `CII = ||V_drift|| / (1 + kΓ)`.
        expected_signals: [Rising CII value, increased Temporal Jitter (Jτ)]
        pitfalls: [Signal-to-noise ratio too low to extract a clean `Ki`, incorrect calibration of the domain-specific scaling constant `k`.]

    excerpt: |
      Instability begins as a waver. As internal or external pressures mount, the system struggles to maintain this geodesic. The first symptom is **Temporal Jitter (Jτ)**: a micro-variation in the system's once-steady rhythm, the sonic artifact of the system fighting to remain coherent. This jitter is the root cause of **Manifold Drift**: the observable "skidding" of the system's `Ki` pattern on the coherence manifold.

      justification: |
        Lagrangian Stress acts as a potential field. A system's deviation from its coherent geodesic is analogous to a particle's displacement from a potential minimum. The resulting "stress" creates a restorative "force" (the impetus for a state transition) that seeks to lower the system's potential and find a new, more stable minimum.

      rationale: The analogy to a potential field where stress accumulates with displacement from an equilibrium geodesic is the most direct and intuitive mapping for this concept.

  disambiguation: |
    Lagrangian Stress is distinct from mechanical stress in continuum physics. It is not a measure of physical force per unit area but an abstract, information-theoretic measure of a system's deviation from its maximally coherent, optimal path. It represents a "stress" on the system's organizational integrity, not its material components.
