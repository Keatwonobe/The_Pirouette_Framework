      snippet: |
        The total coherence of the two systems (`Kτ₁ + Kτ₂`) represents a quantity of low-entropy structural information. During the manifold collapse, this information is not lost; it is unbound, transformed with near-perfect efficiency into the chaotic, high-entropy energy of the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).

  art: |
    The song a system sings to maintain its form against the silence of entropy. It is the intricate melody of persistence, the rhythmic knot of existence whose complexity is measured not in notes, but in the energy it would release if its harmony were to collapse into silence.
  law: |
    A system's dynamics are governed by the maximization of its total coherence (`Kτ`) over its worldline, representing the path of least action for maintaining its structured, low-entropy form.
  philosophy: |
    Coherence is the measure of 'being.' It reframes existence not as a static property but as an active, information-theoretic process. A system's `Kτ` is the quantifiable evidence of its successful argument against non-existence, making annihilation the final concession where that argument is perfectly refuted.
pirouette_definition: |
  System Coherence (Kτ) is the integrated measure of a system's total, time-persistent, low-entropy structural information. It represents the degree to which a system's constituent resonant patterns (`Ki`) are phase-locked into a stable, self-reinforcing topological form. Governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, `Kτ` is the term maximized by a system's dynamics along its geodesic, representing the energetic value of its existence that is released as unbound energy (Γ) upon dissolution.

        outline: |
          Introduce a system to its phase-conjugate counterpart in a temporally quiescent environment (low Γ). Measure the total energy of all decay products from the resulting Zero-Sum Pirouette. Assuming near-perfect conversion efficiency as predicted by DOMA-109, the measured energy output is a direct measure of the combined initial system coherence (Kτ_total = Kτ₁ + Kτ₂).

  - module: DOMA-109
    excerpt: |
      The mechanics of this dissolution are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), which dictates that a system will follow the path that maximizes its coherence (`Kτ`) while minimizing its environmental cost (`V_Γ`). ... As their coherence manifolds overlap, their individual `Ki` patterns undergo perfect destructive interference, causing the total coherence of the combined system to collapse towards zero: `Kτ (sys) → 0`.
  - module: DOMA-109
    excerpt: |
      The immense energy release associated with annihilation is a direct conversion of structured information into entropy. The total coherence of the two systems (`Kτ₁ + Kτ₂`) represents a quantity of low-entropy structural information. During the manifold collapse, this information is not lost; it is unbound, transformed with near-perfect efficiency into the chaotic, high-entropy energy of the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).

        Kτ ∝ -S = -k_B Σ p_i log(p_i)
      justification: |
        The module describes `Kτ` as "low-entropy structural information." This aligns with the concept of negentropy, which quantifies the distance of a system from a state of maximum entropy (chaos). `Kτ` can be seen as the physical manifestation of this informational order.

    - target: Rest Mass-Energy (E_rest)
      rationale: |
        This mapping is operationally direct, as per DOMA-109 §4, which frames `E=mc²` as the "direct accounting of the energetic value of a system's bound, time-persistent pattern." It provides a measurable, falsifiable link between the abstract concept of coherence and the physical quantity of mass.

  claims:
    - statement: "The total energy released in a perfect particle-antiparticle annihilation event is precisely equal to the sum of the initial `Kτ` of the two particles, with a conversion efficiency approaching 100%."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "Observation of a significant, consistent energy deficit or surplus in annihilation events after accounting for all decay products and known interactions. This would imply either that `Kτ` is not fully converted or that `Kτ` is not equivalent to mass-energy."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [Kinetic Energy (often K), Torque or Proper Time (often τ)]
  disambiguation: |
    `Kτ` should not be confused with kinetic energy. The `K` derives from *Kohärenz* (coherence) or *Knot*, and `τ` (tau) signifies its time-persistent, integrated nature. It represents the potential energy bound in a system's structure, not its energy of motion.
