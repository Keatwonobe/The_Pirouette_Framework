  art: |
    The universe is sewn together from primordial fragments, and Phase Fractures are the stitches. They are the beautiful, jagged seams proving that even the cosmos was once broken and then made whole.
  law: |
    A Phase Fracture is a persistent, two-dimensional surface embedded in the Cosmic Coherence Manifold, identifiable as a statistically significant planar discontinuity in the Coherence Residual Map (Œîùìõ_p). Its signature is a sharp gradient change in cosmological fields (e.g., Temporal Pressure, Œì) across the seam, inconsistent with gravitational lensing or filamentary accretion alone.
  philosophy: |
    Phase Fractures are the ultimate cosmic archaeology. They are not merely features *in* the universe but are part of the *foundational act* of its creation, providing direct, falsifiable evidence for the Alchemical Union and the universe's primordial patchwork nature.
pirouette_definition: |
  A theorized class of primordial cosmic scar, representing the boundary interface where distinct regions of the early universe, each with its own nascent coherence manifold, underwent an imperfect Alchemical Union (CORE-012) during a cosmological phase transition. Manifesting as topological seams, they are the most fundamental and ancient features on the Coherence Residual Map, encoding the initial conditions and symmetries of the universe's constituent patches.
operational_definition:
  units: The magnitude of the fracture is measured via the Coherence Residual, Œîùìõ_p, which has units of energy density (J/m¬≥).

        outline: |
          1. Generate the observed Cosmic Coherence Manifold, `ùìõ_p(observed)`, by translating CMB, galaxy survey, and gravitational lensing data via the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014).
          2. Compute the theoretical Null Canvas, `ùìõ_p(model)`, by solving the Pirouette Lagrangian for a perfectly homogenous and isotropic universe.
          3. Calculate the Coherence Residual Map: `Œîùìõ_p = ùìõ_p(observed) - ùìõ_p(model)`.
          4. Search the residual map for statistically significant, persistent 2D planar or linear features that are not attributable to standard structure formation.
        expected_signals: [Sharp, large-scale linear discontinuities in CMB temperature gradient maps, Correlated shear anomalies in wide-field lensing surveys, A planar "wall" of suppressed or altered galaxy formation.]
        pitfalls: [Signal can be mimicked by line-of-sight alignment of multiple large-scale structures, Extremely low signal-to-noise ratio requires cross-correlation of multiple cosmological probes, Theoretical model for `ùìõ_p(model)` must be exceptionally precise.]

    excerpt: |
      The *Scars of Creation* are persistent, non-uniform terms in the Lagrangian itself‚Äî`V_scar(x)`‚Äîthat represent the stored "potential energy" of a historical trauma... The **Coherence Residual Map** (`Œîùìõ_p`) is therefore our direct measurement of this historical term: `Œîùìõ_p ‚âà -V_scar(x)`. By mapping the residuals, we are mapping the geometry and intensity of the universe's memory.

        A solution to a scalar field (œï) equation with a potential V(œï) having multiple degenerate minima, e.g., V(œï) = Œª(œï¬≤ - Œ∑¬≤)¬≤.
      justification: |
        Phase Fractures are described as 2D boundaries between primordial regions formed during a phase transition. This is a direct conceptual analogue to cosmic domain walls, which are sheet-like topological defects predicted to form when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to different regions of the universe falling into different vacuum states.

      falsifier: "An all-sky, multi-probe (CMB, lensing, galaxy surveys) analysis of the Coherence Residual Map finds no statistically significant 2D topological features after accounting for all known astrophysical and cosmological effects. The universe's large-scale structure is fully explained by gravitational instability on a smooth primordial canvas."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol Œ£ is widely used for cross-sections or summation, while Œ¶ is used for scalar fields or fluxes. The combination Œ£_Œ¶ is intended to uniquely denote a *surface* (Œ£) associated with a *phase* (Œ¶).]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from **Cosmic Wound Channels**, which are 1D *filaments* deepened by cosmic evolution within a coherent region. Phase Fractures are 2D *primordial boundaries* formed between formerly distinct regions. A Fracture is a suture, while a Wound Channel is a groove.
