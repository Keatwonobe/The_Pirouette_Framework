        This protocol works in reverse to engineer a desired system state. Given a target property (e.g., "the top 1% of nodes must not account for more than 50% of total influence"), it can solve for the Coherence Gradient (`α`) required to produce that outcome. This transforms the instrument from a passive diagnostic tool into an active design template for building more resilient or efficient systems.

  art: |
    To sculpt the riverbed before the water flows. It is the art of designing an echo, of pre-emptively carving the channels of influence to guide a system toward a desired harmony.
  law: |
    For any well-defined macroscopic property dependent on a system's influence hierarchy (e.g., resource concentration, fragility), there exists a corresponding Coherence Gradient (`α`) that will produce it. The protocol solves for this gradient, providing the architectural specification for the system.
  philosophy: |
    This transforms the Weaver from a passive observer of system history into an active architect of its future. It asserts that systemic properties like resilience and efficiency are not emergent accidents but designable outcomes, achievable through the precise shaping of a system's structural memory.
pirouette_definition: |
  A design protocol that inverts the diagnostic process of Forward Analysis. It begins with a desired macroscopic system property—such as a specific level of influence concentration or resilience—and calculates the required Coherence Gradient (`α`). This gradient then serves as a design specification for tuning the system's underlying dynamics to produce the target state.

        outline: |
          1. **Define Target Property (`P_target`):** Articulate a desired systemic outcome as a mathematical constraint on the Resonant Hierarchy Distribution. (e.g., "The top 1% of attractors must command no more than 40% of total system activity.")
          2. **Formulate Constraint Equation:** Express `P_target` as an equation involving the rank-frequency function `f(r)`.
          3. **Solve for `α_target`:** Numerically or analytically solve the constraint equation for the Coherence Gradient `α`.
          4. **Implement Dynamics:** Modify system rules, costs, or feedback loops to engineer interactions that will naturally converge to the calculated `α_target`. This is a control problem, not a statistical one.
        expected_signals: [A single dimensionless value for `α_target`.]
        pitfalls: [Mis-specifying the target property mathematically; inability to map `α_target` to concrete, implementable system dynamics; ignoring second-order effects of altering the system's core hierarchy.]

    excerpt: |
      The value of `α` reflects the system's optimal balance between maximizing internal coherence (`K_τ`) and enduring the external pressures (`V_Γ`) of its environment. A steep gradient (`α` → 1) is often the most efficient solution in a stable environment... A shallow gradient (`α` > 2) is a solution for maximizing long-term coherence in a volatile environment...

        Given P(α), find α such that P(α) = P_target
      justification: |
        Inverse analysis follows the general structure of an inverse problem: inferring the causal parameters (`α`) of a system from its desired observable effects (`P_target`). Whereas forward analysis predicts effects from causes, inverse analysis finds the causes required for a desired effect.

    Distinct from **Forward Analysis**, which is a diagnostic protocol to *measure* the existing Coherence Gradient from observed data. Inverse Analysis is a design protocol to *specify* a target Coherence Gradient based on desired outcomes. One reads the past; the other writes the future.
