        The old "Migration Potential Field" is thus reborn as a dynamic coherence manifold, shaped by two primary forces:
        *   **Coherence (Kτ) as Opportunity and Resonance:** This is the "gravity well" of belonging that pulls a population forward.
        *   **Temporal Pressure (Γ) as Adversity and Dissonance:** This is the chaotic energy that pushes a population to move.

    A psycho-social terrain where the rivers of human hope carve paths toward resonance. Its mountains are made of fear and its valleys are filled with the promise of a song sung in unison. Populations flow across this geography not by choice, but as water seeks its level.
  law: |
    The net migration flow between two regions is proportional to the gradient of the landscape's potential, a scalar field determined by the relative difference in local Coherence (Kτ) and Temporal Pressure (Γ). Populations will follow a geodesic path that maximizes integrated coherence over time.
  philosophy: |
    Migration is not a political problem to be solved but a fundamental, coherence-seeking process of the universe. The Landscape of Belonging reframes the question from "How do we stop this flow?" to "What features of the landscape are causing this river to flood?" It demands we see the system, not just the symptom.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dynamic, psycho-social manifold upon which population migration occurs. The landscape's topology is defined by two primary scalar fields: Coherence (Kτ), which acts as a potential well (an attractive force), and Temporal Pressure (Γ), which acts as a potential hill (a repulsive force). A population's movement is modeled as a flow along a geodesic on this manifold, representing the path of maximal coherence-gain over time. Features such as borders (Coherence Dams) and routes (Wound Channels) act as engineered or emergent structures that alter the local topology and influence flow dynamics.

        outline: |
          1.  Define a set of proxy indicators for Coherence (e.g., political stability index, GDP per capita, social trust surveys) and Temporal Pressure (e.g., conflict event data, climate vulnerability index, food insecurity levels).
          2.  Normalize and weight these indicators to construct composite Kτ and Γ scalar fields on a geographic grid.
          3.  Define the landscape potential V_eff ≈ w_Γ*Γ - w_K*Kτ.
          4.  Calculate the gradient of this potential field (∇V_eff). The resulting vector field represents the predicted direction and magnitude of migration pressure.
        expected_signals: [A strong correlation between the direction and magnitude of the calculated gradient and observed net migration data (e.g., from IOM, UNHCR)., Predictive power for emerging crises where the gradient steepens rapidly over time.]
        pitfalls: [Proxy selection bias radically alters the landscape topology., Data latency in official statistics fails to capture rapidly developing pressures., Over-fitting weights in the composite index based on historical data reduces predictive power for novel crises.]

    excerpt: |
      Human migration is a population following a geodesic—a path of least resistance and maximal coherence—across a vast, psycho-social terrain we call the Landscape of Belonging. This landscape is shaped by the promise of stability and the pressure of chaos. The decision to move, the path taken, and the process of arrival are all expressions of a single, universal drive: the search for a place where a people's song can be sung without dissonance.
  - module: DOMA-153
    excerpt: |
      Borders, whether physical walls or labyrinthine bureaucracies, are engineered regions of extreme, localized Temporal Pressure. They function as a `Gladiator Force`, intentionally designed to halt or filter the flow. They do not eliminate the gradient that drives the movement; they obstruct it, often creating the conditions for Stagnant Flow.

      justification: |
        The model describes populations as "particles" moving to minimize a potential on a surface. The drive to move is determined by the gradient of this potential field, directly analogous to a conservative force `F = -∇V` in classical mechanics. Coherence acts as a potential well (lowering V), while Temporal Pressure acts as a potential hill (raising V).

      falsifier: "Multiple case studies show a steepening coherence gradient (e.g., due to sudden economic collapse in one region) with no corresponding increase in migration flow, or with a significant flow against the predicted gradient, after accounting for border friction (Coherence Dams)."

    Unlike a fitness landscape where entities move via mutation/selection, or a physical potential landscape, the Landscape of Belonging is a *psycho-social* manifold. Its dimensions are metrics of collective human experience (safety, opportunity, identity), not physical coordinates or genetic alleles, though it is often projected onto geographic space for analysis.

# Landscape of Belonging

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A dynamic, psycho-social manifold upon which population migration occurs. The landscape's topology is defined by two primary scalar fields: Coherence (Kτ), which acts as a potential well (an attractive force), and Temporal Pressure (Γ), which acts as a potential hill (a repulsive force). A population's movement is modeled as a flow along a geodesic on this manifold, representing the path of maximal coherence-gain over time. Features such as borders (Coherence Dams) and routes (Wound Channels) act as engineered or emergent structures that alter the local topology and influence flow dynamics.

## EFT-First Summary
The Landscape of Belonging is modeled as a classical potential energy surface where the effective potential `V_eff` is a function of local Coherence (Kτ) and Temporal Pressure (Γ). Migration flow is analogous to the motion of a population of particles subject to a conservative force, moving to minimize their potential. The flow vector `J` is thus proportional to the negative gradient of the potential, following `J ∝ -∇V_eff`. This provides a field-theoretic basis for predicting population movements based on measurable socio-economic indicators.
