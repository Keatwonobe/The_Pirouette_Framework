  art: |
    A universal question that acts as a tuning fork. When asked of any system, it strikes the abstract principle to make the concrete reality resonate with its pattern, revealing the unseen.
  law: |
    Every ratified concept in the Lexicon must be paired with a unique, interrogative Correspondence Protocol that maps the abstract term to a measurable or observable feature of a target system.
  philosophy: |
    The Protocol is the framework's primary defense against sterile abstraction. It ensures that language is not a self-referential map, but a functional instrument for navigating and shaping reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  A universal question paired with each term in the Weaver's Lexicon. The protocol acts as a cognitive lens, designed to bridge an abstract, universal principle to its specific, concrete manifestation within any given system, thereby grounding theory in direct application and ensuring semantic coherence among Weavers.

        outline: |
          1. Select a term and its protocol.
          2. Select a target system (e.g., a project, team dynamic, codebase).
          3. Three or more Weavers independently apply the protocol's question to the system and record their observations.
          4. Compare the resulting observations for semantic overlap and convergence.
        expected_signals: [High inter-observer agreement ( '>>80%' overlap) on the locus and characteristics of the phenomenon, Rapid convergence of discourse, Reduction in ambiguity when using the term]
        pitfalls: [The protocol's question is too ambiguous, leading to divergent interpretations, The target system is too complex to yield a single, clear answer without decomposition]

        Operationalization is the process of defining a fuzzy concept so it can be measured and identified empirically. A Correspondence Protocol is a specific, interrogative form of operationalization, guiding a practitioner's perception toward the empirical instance of a theoretical construct via a structured inquiry.

  disambiguation: |
    This is distinct from a simple 'prompt' or 'checklist item.' A Correspondence Protocol is not meant to elicit a generic response, but to act as a *lens* that attunes the observer's perception to a specific, universal pattern within a unique, concrete context. It is for tuning perception, not for extracting data.

# Correspondence Protocol

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A universal question paired with each term in the Weaver's Lexicon. The protocol acts as a cognitive lens, designed to bridge an abstract, universal principle to its specific, concrete manifestation within any given system, thereby grounding theory in direct application and ensuring semantic coherence among Weavers.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, a Correspondence Protocol serves as an **operationalization** of a theoretical term. As described in the philosophy of science, operationalization connects an abstract concept to empirical observation. The Protocol achieves this through a structured question, guiding the observer to identify the concrete indicators of the abstract concept within a specific context, much like defining "temperature" by the procedure of measuring it with a thermometer.
