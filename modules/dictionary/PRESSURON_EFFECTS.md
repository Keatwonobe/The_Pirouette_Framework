        Per MATH-015, Pirouette-specific physics (e.g., Γ/pressuron dressing) must appear as an additive correction
        \[
        a_\ell = \sum_{n\ge1} C_n^{\rm QED}\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^{\!n}
        +\Delta a_\ell^{(\Gamma)} ,
        \]
        where $\Delta a_\ell^{(\Gamma)}$ is derived in its own EFT and \emph{does not} alter $C_2^{\rm QED}$.

    The vacuum's perfect spin, disturbed. A breath of temporal pressure, Γ, deforms the particle's gyre, recording the medium's local stress as a minute, non-universal wobble.
  law: |
    The total anomalous magnetic moment `a_ℓ` is the sum of a universal, calculable component `a_ℓ^(uni)` and a non-universal component `Δa_ℓ^(Γ)`. `Δa_ℓ^(Γ)` must vanish as the temporal pressure Γ approaches zero, thereby isolating all Pirouette-specific physics from the universal coefficients `C_n`.
  philosophy: |
    By strictly separating universal constants from model-dependent corrections, the framework maintains falsifiability. Pressuron effects serve as the primary testbed for Pirouette's core hypothesis—that spacetime's medium possesses a measurable 'pressure'—without corrupting the validated successes of QED.
pirouette_definition: |
  A proposed, non-universal, additive correction to the lepton anomalous magnetic moment (`a_ℓ`), denoted `Δa_ℓ^(Γ)`. It quantifies the deviation from the universal Standard Model prediction `a_ℓ^(SM)` due to the particle's interaction with the local temporal pressure, Γ. By definition, `Δa_ℓ^(Γ)` is calculated separately from the universal coefficients (`C_n`) and must approach zero as Γ approaches zero.

          1. Perform a high-precision measurement of the lepton anomalous magnetic moment `a_ℓ^(exp)` (e.g., via Penning trap spectroscopy).
          2. Compute the Standard Model prediction `a_ℓ^(SM)` to equivalent or higher precision, including all known QED, electroweak, and hadronic contributions.
          3. The pressuron effect is the residual: `Δa_ℓ^(Γ) = a_ℓ^(exp) - a_ℓ^(SM)`.
          4. Correlate this residual with local environmental conditions hypothesized to modulate Γ.

      Per MATH-015, Pirouette-specific physics (e.g., Γ/pressuron dressing) must appear as an additive correction `a_ℓ = Σ C_n^(QED)(α/π)ⁿ + Δa_ℓ^(Γ)`, where `Δa_ℓ^(Γ)` is derived in its own EFT and *does not* alter `C_2^(QED)`. This keeps the universal constant universal.

      justification: |
        Pressuron Effects are the Pirouette framework's specific theoretical model for the generic 'New Physics' (NP) contribution to the lepton anomalous magnetic moment. While `a_ℓ^(NP)` is an agnostic placeholder for any deviation from the Standard Model, `Δa_ℓ^(Γ)` posits a specific physical origin rooted in the temporal pressure Γ.

          date: 2021-04-07
      rationale: This mapping is adopted because `Δa_ℓ^(Γ)` is explicitly defined to occupy the same operational space as a generic New Physics contribution to `a_ℓ`. Its primary empirical test is the measurement of a non-zero `a_ℓ^(exp) - a_ℓ^(SM)`.

    Distinguish from `Γ` as a decay width. In the symbol `Δa_ℓ^(Γ)`, Γ is the Temporal Pressure parameter, not a rate. The term "Pressuron" specifies the physical origin of the effect, differentiating it from other potential BSM contributions to g-2 (e.g., from supersymmetry or leptoquarks).

# Pressuron Effects

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A proposed, non-universal, additive correction to the lepton anomalous magnetic moment (`a_ℓ`), denoted `Δa_ℓ^(Γ)`. It quantifies the deviation from the universal Standard Model prediction `a_ℓ^(SM)` due to the particle's interaction with the local temporal pressure, Γ. By definition, `Δa_ℓ^(Γ)` is calculated separately from the universal coefficients (`C_n`) and must approach zero as Γ approaches zero.

## EFT-First Summary
Pressuron Effects are the Pirouette framework's model for the generic "New Physics" contribution to the lepton anomalous magnetic moment, `a_ℓ^(NP)`. Operationally, this is the measured discrepancy `a_ℓ^(exp) - a_ℓ^(SM)`, famously observed in muon g-2 experiments (see [PRL 126, 141801](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.141801)). Pirouette posits this deviation is not a new universal constant but an effect sourced by a local, variable environmental field called Temporal Pressure (Γ).
