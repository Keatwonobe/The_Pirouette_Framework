        Write the Coherence Narrative: Synthesize the disruption map, dissonance ledger, and antagonist persona into a concise causal narrative. This "working model" tells the story of how the antagonist interacts with the host system to produce the observed effects.

  art: |
    In the dark forest of an unknown pathology, this is the art of giving the shadow a provisional face. It is a story told not because it is true, but so that by following its thread, we may discover what is.
  law: |
    A Coherence Narrative must synthesize all known data (`Disruption Map`) and known unknowns (`Dissonance Ledger`) into a falsifiable causal model. Every claim within the narrative must be tagged with an explicit evidence grade, and its primary function is the generation of non-obvious, testable predictions.
  philosophy: |
    To confront an unknown, one cannot merely collect data; one must structure ignorance. The Coherence Narrative provides this structure, transforming a void of knowledge into a navigable map for discovery by positing a falsifiable antagonist whose actions can be predicted and tested.

  The Coherence Narrative is the concise, falsifiable, and causal story that synthesizes a system's observable disruptions (`Disruption Map`), its known unknowns (`Dissonance Ledger`), and a hypothesized `Antagonist Persona`. It functions as a working model of a pathology with an unknown etiology, designed specifically to generate non-obvious, testable predictions about the system's behavior by tracing the narrative's necessary consequences.

        outline: |
          1.  **Map Disruption:** Chart the system's pathological flow states (`Laminar`, `Turbulent`, `Stagnant`) using Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`).
          2.  **Chart Dissonance:** Explicitly list all causal gaps, paradoxes, and unanswered questions in a `Dissonance Ledger`.
          3.  **Personify Antagonist:** Based on the disruption pattern, craft a persona for the pathological agent (e.g., "Resonance Thief," "Thread Cutter").
          4.  **Write Narrative:** Weave the map, ledger, and persona into a single, concise causal story.
          5.  **Trace Echoes:** Translate the story into a set of unique, falsifiable hypotheses that constitute a targeted research program.

    excerpt: |
      Where its sibling module, The Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`), moves from a known cause to its systemic effects, The Daedalus Gambit works in reverse. It begins with the disrupted flow—the dissonant wake of an unseen pathology—and constructs a coherent narrative persona for the antagonist. This "character" and its story become a powerful engine for generating precise, falsifiable hypotheses, turning the void of ignorance into a navigable map for discovery.

      "The motor neuron network, a system requiring immense logistical integrity, is being eroded by The Thread Cutter [Speculative]. This dissonant resonance systematically introduces noise into the delicate machinery of axonal transport, inducing a state of chronic **Turbulent Flow** [Moderate]... The first fasciculation is the sound of the first thread snapping. The central mystery, captured in the **Dissonance Ledger** [Low], is the true identity and origin of this parasitic rhythm."

      justification: |
        Like a phenomenological model, the Coherence Narrative provides a simplified, non-fundamental description of a complex system's behavior. Its purpose is not to be the final theory but to organize observations and make predictions that guide the search for a more fundamental explanation.

        The protocol formalizes abductive reasoning—inference to the best explanation. The narrative is a structured 'best explanation' for a set of pathological observations, rigorously constrained by the mandate of falsifiability and evidence tagging.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a simple 'hypothesis'. A Coherence Narrative is a story-structured system of interconnected hypotheses rooted in a persona, not a single, isolated conjecture. It is also distinct from a 'theory,' which implies a much higher degree of empirical validation and is the desired end-state, not the exploratory tool.

# Coherence Narrative

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Coherence Narrative is the concise, falsifiable, and causal story that synthesizes a system's observable disruptions (`Disruption Map`), its known unknowns (`Dissonance Ledger`), and a hypothesized `Antagonist Persona`. It functions as a working model of a pathology with an unknown etiology, designed specifically to generate non-obvious, testable predictions about the system's behavior by tracing the narrative's necessary consequences.

## EFT-First Summary
A Coherence Narrative is a structured form of abductive reasoning used to posit the functional form of a pathological potential term, `V_pathology`, in a system's effective Lagrangian. By observing how the system's dynamics deviate from its healthy geodesic, the narrative proposes a 'story' for the new physics (the antagonist) causing the deviation. This story is a phenomenological model whose primary value is its ability to predict other, unobserved effects of `V_pathology`, thus guiding experimental search.
