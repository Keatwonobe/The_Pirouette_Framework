      snippet: |
        The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) posits that all dynamics in the universe are the result of systems following geodesics on a manifold of coherence.

  art: |
    The riverbed of reality, sculpted by the flow of time and resonance. Its currents and eddies guide all motion, from the dance of particles to the waltz of galaxies.
  law: |
    All physical systems evolve by following geodesics on the Manifold of Coherence, which extremizes the action defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian. The manifold's local geometry (gradient, curl) is operationally equivalent to classical force fields (E, B).
  philosophy: |
    This reframes physics from a study of forces pushing objects to a study of geometry guiding processes. It posits that the universe is not a container with things in it, but a self-organizing pattern whose very fabric dictates the 'rules' of interaction.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental geometric substrate whose local curvature and topology dictate all physical dynamics. Systems follow geodesics on this manifold to satisfy the Principle of Maximal Coherence. Its features, such as gradient (slope) and curl (vortex), manifest as the electric and magnetic fields, while its topological properties determine stable particle structures like spin.
operational_definition:
  units: Fundamentally dimensionless; its coordinate chart inherits dimensions from spacetime (L, T) and phase.
  symbol_table:
    - name: $\mathcal{M}_C$
      meaning: The Manifold of Coherence
      dimensions: Dimensionless (structure); coordinates are spatio-temporal.
      default_range: N/A (a geometric space, not a quantity)
  measurement:
    procedures:
      - name: Geometric Field Tomography
        outline: |
          Observe the trajectory of a probe particle (e.g., an electron) in a region of spacetime. The observed acceleration and rotation (precession) directly map to the local gradient and curl of the manifold, allowing for a reconstruction of its geometry. This is analogous to using test charges to map an electromagnetic field.
        expected_signals: [Particle deflection (Lorentz-like force), Spin precession (Larmor-like frequency)]
        pitfalls: [Disentangling the manifold's geometry from the probe particle's own self-interaction ("wake").]

    excerpt: |
      The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) posits that all dynamics in the universe are the result of systems following geodesics on a manifold of coherence. This module serves as the first and most critical test of that claim. We will now use this single Lagrangian as an engine to derive the three great forces of nature...
  - module: DOMA-052
    excerpt: |
      In this framework, spin is not an intrinsic property but an emergent, topological feature of a particle's stable resonance (Ki). For a particle to persist, its resonance must form a self-referential knot in the coherence manifold. The Principle of Maximal Coherence demands this knot adopt a maximally resilient form.

    - target: Spacetime manifold ($\mathcal{M}$)
      domain: GR
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Like the spacetime manifold in General Relativity, the Manifold of Coherence is a geometric structure whose curvature dictates the motion of objects (geodesics). However, it is a more fundamental object, encoding not just gravity but all forces and even particle topology within its geometry.
      confidence: 0.7
    - target: Fiber bundle (e.g., U(1) bundle)
      domain: Math
      mapping_kind: mathematical
      justification: |
        The description of local features (gradient, curl) corresponding to physical fields (E, B) strongly suggests the manifold is a fiber bundle over spacetime. The 'fibers' would represent internal coherence states, and the gauge fields would be the connection on this bundle.

  claims:
    - statement: "The geometry of the Manifold of Coherence is sufficient to describe all known fundamental forces without introducing separate charge-like sources or force carriers."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "The discovery of a fundamental interaction that cannot be described as a geodesic motion on a manifold whose geometry is determined by the Pirouette Lagrangian. For example, a violation of the equivalence principle that cannot be explained by local curvature."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the 'spacetime manifold' of General Relativity. While related, the Manifold of Coherence is a more fundamental substrate that encodes information for *all* forces, not just gravity, and includes topological features that define particle identity.
