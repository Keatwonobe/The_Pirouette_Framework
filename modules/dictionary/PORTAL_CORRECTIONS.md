  art: |
    A hidden crack in the world's structure, a Wound Channel, does not leak matter but instead whispers a number. This integer, a topological invariant, travels through a mathematical portal to disturb the delicate dance of particles, causing a subtle but measurable shift in their properties.
  law: |
    Any correction to an observable quantity `𝒪` arising from a topological Wound Channel is a discrete shift `Δ𝒪` that is a polynomial function of the integer Portal Index `T` and local curvature invariants. No continuous exponents or non-integer indices are permitted.
  philosophy: |
    Portal Corrections make topology consequential. They provide the explicit mechanism by which abstract, global properties of the coherence manifold become concrete, local, and falsifiable measurements. This prevents topology from being mere mathematical decoration and grounds it as a physical cause.
pirouette_definition: |
  A discrete, non-perturbative correction, `Δ𝒪`, to a physical observable `𝒪`, sourced by the topological structure of a Wound Channel. The correction is a sum of terms `Σ_j a_j 𝒦_j`, where `a_j` are dimensionless coefficients and `𝒦_j` are correction kernels. Each kernel `𝒦_j` is a polynomial function of the integer Portal Index `T` (derived from the defect's homotopy class) and local gauge-invariant curvature scalars.

      justification: |
        In the Aharonov-Bohm effect, a particle's wavefunction acquires a phase shift from a magnetic field in a region it does not classically access. This physical effect depends on the topology of the space (the hole through which the flux passes) and is quantized. Portal Corrections are analogous, as a non-local topological feature (the Wound Channel) produces a discrete, observable effect on local physics.

# Portal Corrections

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Portal Correction is a discrete, non-perturbative correction, `Δ𝒪`, to a physical observable `𝒪`, sourced by the topological structure of a Wound Channel. The correction is a sum of terms `Σ_j a_j 𝒦_j`, where `a_j` are dimensionless coefficients and `𝒦_j` are correction kernels. Each kernel `𝒦_j` is a polynomial function of the integer Portal Index `T` (derived from the defect's homotopy class) and local gauge-invariant curvature scalars.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Portal Corrections are analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, where a non-local topological feature creates a direct, measurable impact on local physics. In the Pirouette Framework, a topological defect in the coherence manifold, characterized by an integer index `T`, sources small, discrete shifts in Standard Model observables like lepton anomalous magnetic moments. These shifts are predicted to follow specific patterns across different measurements, allowing the underlying topological index `T` to be determined experimentally by fitting a range of precision anomalies.
