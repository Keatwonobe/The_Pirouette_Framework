  art: |
    A Shadow Profile is the fingerprint left by a gaze. It is the geometric signature of a single act of knowing, revealing whether the observer's touch was a question or a command.
  law: |
    A Shadow Profile is a standardized four-component vector (V_obs, ŒîKœÑ_sys, Œ¶_KœÑ, œÑ_echo) that quantifies the total impact of an observation. Any measurement interaction can be losslessly compressed into this profile.
  philosophy: |
    The profile enforces cognitive responsibility. By making the cost and character of observation explicit, it transforms measurement from a passive act of data extraction into a conscious, accountable dialogue with reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  A synthesized, quantitative summary of an observation's nature, derived from the four core Shadow Gauge metrics: Shadow Weight (V_obs), Coherence Cost (ŒîKœÑ_sys), Information Transfer (Œ¶_KœÑ), and Echo Persistence (œÑ_echo). The profile serves as a formal audit of an observer's geometric and energetic impact on a system's coherence manifold.
operational_definition:
  units: Component-dependent vector. See symbol table.
  symbol_table:
    - name: V_obs
      meaning: Shadow Weight; magnitude of the observer's potential field.
      dimensions: M L^2 T^-2 (Energy)
      default_range: 10^-34 to 10^3 J
    - name: ŒîKœÑ_sys
      meaning: Coherence Cost; net change in the system's internal temporal coherence.
      dimensions: M L^2 T^-2 (Energy)
      default_range: -contextual to +contextual
    - name: Œ¶_KœÑ
      meaning: Information Transfer; net flow of coherence between observer and system.
      dimensions: M L^2 T^-2 (Energy)
      default_range: -contextual to +contextual
    - name: œÑ_echo
      meaning: Echo Persistence; decay time of the measurement's imprint on the system.

        outline: |
          1.  **Baseline:** Characterize the unperturbed system's Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_sys).
          2.  **Coupling:** Model the observer's potential field (V_obs) as an additional term.
          3.  **Calculation:** Evolve the system under the perturbed Lagrangian (ùìõ'_sys = ùìõ_sys - V_obs).
          4.  **Reporting:** Compute the four core metrics from the system's trajectory to generate the Shadow Profile (Œ†_s).
        expected_signals: [V_obs, ŒîKœÑ_sys, Œ¶_KœÑ, œÑ_echo]
        pitfalls: [Inaccurate baseline characterization (ùìõ_sys), incorrect modeling of the observer's potential (V_obs), contamination from unmodeled environmental potentials (VŒì_env).]

      **Quantum Physics:** Frames the measurement problem as a resonant coupling that forges a new, definite reality from a field of potential, with the Shadow Profile quantifying the nature of the "collapse."

      justification: |
        The Shadow Profile provides a structured vector of quantities that formalize the concepts of measurement back-action (ŒîKœÑ_sys), probe coupling (V_obs), and information gain (Œ¶_KœÑ) inherent in quantum measurement theory. It aims to unify these typically distinct considerations into a single, comprehensive descriptor of the interaction.

      falsifier: "Demonstration of a measurement that verifiably extracts information from a system (non-zero Œ¶_KœÑ) while producing a null result for the other three profile components (V_obs=0, ŒîKœÑ_sys=0, œÑ_echo=0)."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The term "profile" is generic. The symbol Œ† is used for projection operators in QM and for osmotic pressure in chemistry.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from psychological or user profiles. A Shadow Profile is a physical characterization of a specific *act of measurement*, not of the observer or the system itself in isolation.
