  law: |
    The geometry experienced by propagating fields is determined by the cycle-averaged Hessian of the substrate action, S_p. This yields a Lorentzian metric, g_μν, with signature (1,3) under the eikonal bound, whose isometries are the Lorentz group SO(1,3).
  philosophy: |
    Establishes that spacetime is not a fundamental container but an emergent structure derived from the dynamics of coherence (Ki) and pressure (Γ). This grounds Lorentz invariance in the substrate's symmetries, avoiding its a priori postulation and framing relativity as a consequence of deeper principles.

  The Hessian Metric, g_μν, is the emergent spacetime metric tensor defined as the second variation of the cycle-averaged Pirouette substrate action, S_p. Formally, g_μν = ⟨∂_μΓ ∂_νΓ - ∂_μKi ∂_νKi*⟩_τ, where the average is taken over a full τ-cycle. It describes the effective geometry through which perturbations of the substrate propagate, and its symmetries define the Lorentz group.

          1. Generate coherent Ki-field perturbations (e.g., via Σ-pushforward, see XAP-006).
          2. Measure the propagation speed `c(Γ)` of these perturbations across a range of substrate pressures Γ.
          3. Confirm the constancy of `c` in the stiff-limit (DYNA-004), which establishes the light-cone structure.
          4. The metric components g_μν are then inferred as the coefficients of the wave equation that preserves this invariant speed.

      Small perturbations Ki = Ki₀ + δKi around a high-coherence background satisfy a wave equation whose speed parameter is c²(Γ). In the stiff-limit, c(Γ) = const, defining the invariant light-cone structure preserved by the τ-isometries. All observers connected by SO(1,3) transformations share identical c(Γ); relativity holds within the time-first ontology.

        The Pirouette g_μν plays the role of the spacetime metric in General Relativity, defining line elements, causal structure, and the geometry upon which fields propagate. However, unlike in GR where it is a fundamental field, here it is an effective, emergent quantity derived from the substrate dynamics of Ki and Γ. This mapping is central to recovering standard physics in the appropriate limit.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the metric of the internal Ki coherence manifold (see DOMA-091). The Hessian Metric g_μν is the emergent *spacetime* metric, not an internal one. It is named for its origin as the Hessian (matrix of second derivatives) of the action with respect to spacetime derivatives of the substrate fields.

# Hessian Metric

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Hessian Metric, g_μν, is the emergent spacetime metric tensor defined as the second variation of the cycle-averaged Pirouette substrate action, S_p. Formally, g_μν = ⟨∂_μΓ ∂_νΓ - ∂_μKi ∂_νKi*⟩_τ, where the average is taken over a full τ-cycle. It describes the effective geometry through which perturbations of the substrate propagate, and its symmetries define the Lorentz group.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory, the Hessian Metric `g_μν` is functionally identical to the Einstein-frame metric tensor of General Relativity. It defines the causal structure and covariant dynamics for all emergent fields. Unlike a fundamental metric, its components are determined by the cycle-averaged gradients of the underlying Pirouette substrate fields, Ki and Γ (XAP-005), making it a composite and dynamic structure derived from a time-first ontology.
