      snippet: |
        By calculating the geodesic equation on a coherence manifold where the connection has been modified by the presence of the potential A_mu (the minimal coupling prescription), we find the equation of motion for a particle p is:
        dp_mu/d(tau) = q * F_munu * u^nu
        ...This is the Lorentz force law, expressed in covariant form.

  art: |
    Every charged particle sings its phase into the universe, and every other listens. The Lorentz force is the grammar of this conversation, the way each particle adjusts its path in response to the harmonies and dissonances it hears. In a universe bound by coherence, no song is ever sung alone.
  law: |
    The rate of change of a charged particle's 4-momentum (`f^μ`) is directly proportional to its charge (`q`), its 4-velocity (`u_ν`), and the local electromagnetic field tensor (`F^{μν}`), according to the covariant equation `f^μ = q F^{μν} u_ν`.
  philosophy: |
    The Lorentz force is not a fundamental, externally applied push or pull. It is a geometric illusion; the necessary consequence of a particle following the straightest possible path (a geodesic) through a region of the Coherence Manifold that has been curved by the presence of an electromagnetic field.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Lorentz Force is the covariant description of the geodesic equation of motion for a charged particle in the Coherence Manifold. It is not an externally applied force, but the necessary consequence of a particle following a geodesic through a region of the manifold whose geometry is determined by the electromagnetic 4-potential `A_μ`. The term `q F^{μν} u_ν` quantifies the deviation of this geodesic from a flat spacetime trajectory.

        outline: |
          Introduce a test particle with known charge `q` and initial 4-velocity `u_ν` into a region of spacetime. Measure the particle's subsequent trajectory to determine the change in its 4-momentum, `dp^μ/dτ`. Given `q` and `u_ν`, this measurement directly infers the components of the local field tensor `F^{μν}` responsible for the deflection.

      This proves that the Lorentz force is not an external push. It is the geometric consequence of a particle trying to travel in a straight line (a geodesic) through a region of the coherence manifold that has been "sheared" and "twisted" by the presence of an electromagnetic field.

        The Pirouette derivation is mathematically identical to the established covariant form of the Lorentz force used in classical and relativistic physics. The framework's contribution is not a new force law, but a geometric reinterpretation of the existing one as a geodesic equation arising from U(1) gauge invariance.

    Distinguish between the Lorentz *force* (`f^μ`), which is the effect on the particle's momentum, and the electromagnetic *field* (`F^{μν}`), which is the geometric property of the manifold causing the effect. The framework treats the force as a derived consequence of the field's geometry.

# Lorentz Force

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Lorentz Force is the covariant description of the geodesic equation of motion for a charged particle in the Coherence Manifold. It is not an externally applied force, but the necessary consequence of a particle following a geodesic through a region of the manifold whose geometry is determined by the electromagnetic 4-potential `A_μ`. The term `q F^{μν} u_ν` quantifies the deviation of this geodesic from a flat spacetime trajectory.

## EFT-First Summary
The Lorentz Force is the Pirouette Framework's geometric interpretation of the standard Lorentz force law of classical and quantum electrodynamics. The covariant equation `f^μ = q F^{μν} u_ν` is derived not as a postulate, but as the geodesic equation for a particle moving in a manifold whose connection is determined by the U(1) gauge field. This provides a direct mathematical mapping to the Standard Model of particle physics, as detailed in Jackson's *Classical Electrodynamics*.
