        We model the lepton anomalous magnetic moment as

    The accounted-for shadow at the edge of a calculation's light. It represents both the humility of truncation and the promise of future refinement, turning the boundary of knowledge into a map for exploration.
  law: |
    The Remainder is the rigorous difference between the experimental value of the lepton anomalous magnetic moment and its theoretical prediction from the truncated Pirouette expansion: δa_ℓ^rem ≡ a_ℓ^exp − (a_ℓ^uni + Δa_ℓ^(Γ)). Its magnitude must shrink predictably as higher-order terms are incorporated into the theoretical prediction.
  philosophy: |
    The Remainder makes the framework honest. By formally parameterizing our ignorance, it embeds the process of scientific discovery into the calculation itself. It prevents over-fitting and transforms "error" from a nuisance into a structured research program, guiding the next wave of theoretical and phenomenological investigation.
pirouette_definition: |
  A collective term in the calculation of the lepton anomalous magnetic moment (a_ℓ) that accounts for all contributions not included in the truncated universal series (a_ℓ^uni) and the one-loop pressuron interaction (Δa_ℓ^(Γ)). It primarily comprises three components: 1) the error from truncating the universal power series in α/π, estimated by the next uncalculated term; 2) mixed higher-order effects, such as two-loop diagrams involving both α and the pressuron coupling g_ℓ; and 3) any external, non-Pirouette contributions like Standard Model hadronic and electroweak loops, when they are not explicitly included in the primary calculation.

          1.  Calculate the theoretical prediction (a_ℓ^th) by summing the universal series (a_ℓ^uni) to a chosen order N and the one-loop pressuron term (Δa_ℓ^(Γ)).
          2.  Obtain the best experimental value for the lepton's anomalous moment (a_ℓ^exp) from measurements.
          3.  Compute the difference: δa_ℓ^rem = a_ℓ^exp - a_ℓ^th.
          4.  Compare this inferred value to theoretical estimates of its expected size (e.g., |C_{N+1}|(α/π)^(N+1)) to check for consistency or signs of new physics.

    excerpt: |
      The total anomalous magnetic moment is modeled as the sum of a universal QED-like series, a one-loop Pressuron piece, and a remainder term. This remainder, δa_ℓ^rem, explicitly accounts for series truncation, mixed higher-order effects like O(αg_ℓ²), and any external contributions (e.g., hadronic/EW) not yet incorporated into the Pirouette calculation. This structure makes the model fit-ready and uncertainty-aware.
  - module: MATH-014
    excerpt: |
      The uncertainty budget must include a component for series truncation, which is the leading part of the remainder term. This is estimated using the expected magnitude of the next term in the series, |C_{N+1}|(α/π)^(N+1), using geometric or Padé heuristics. This contribution is reported as σ_trunc and combined in quadrature with other uncertainties.

        In any perturbative expansion, the remainder represents the sum of all terms from the truncation order to infinity. The δa_ℓ^rem term generalizes this standard mathematical and physical concept to also include physically distinct but uncalculated effects (e.g., mixed-coupling loops, external inputs), serving the same role as a formal correction term that bounds the theory's precision.

    The Remainder (δa_ℓ^rem) is a physical quantity representing the sum of all uncalculated effects. It should be distinguished from the truncation uncertainty (σ_trunc), which is a statistical estimate of only one component of the remainder (the next term in the universal series). δa_ℓ^rem contains specific, calculable physics, not just numerical error.

# Remainder (δa_ℓ^rem)

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A collective term in the calculation of the lepton anomalous magnetic moment (a_ℓ) that accounts for all contributions not included in the truncated universal series (a_ℓ^uni) and the one-loop pressuron interaction (Δa_ℓ^(Γ)). It primarily comprises three components: 1) the error from truncating the universal power series in α/π, estimated by the next uncalculated term; 2) mixed higher-order effects, such as two-loop diagrams involving both α and the pressuron coupling g_ℓ; and 3) any external, non-Pirouette contributions like Standard Model hadronic and electroweak loops, when they are not explicitly included in the primary calculation.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory, δa_ℓ^rem corresponds to the combined effect of all higher-dimensional operators and loop corrections not explicitly included in the truncated Lagrangian. It is the theoretical error budget, representing the sum of higher-order terms in the perturbative expansion (e.g., `O(α³)`), mixed-coupling loops (`O(α g_ℓ²)`), and contributions from other sectors (like hadronic loops) that are integrated out or treated as external inputs. Its value is inferred by subtracting the calculated prediction from experimental data.
