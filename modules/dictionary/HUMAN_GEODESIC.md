        In the Pirouette Framework, a human being is a complex resonant system (Ki) perpetually navigating a landscape of social and environmental Temporal Pressure (Γ). The fundamental drive of any individual... is to follow a path of maximal coherence—a geodesic that best preserves their internal integrity.

  art: |
    The thread of a single life, tracing the path of least resistance not through space, but through the pressures of time and belonging. It is the silent melody a soul makes as it navigates the choir.
  law: |
    A Human Geodesic is the worldline that maximizes the time-integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian for a given resonant system (Ki), thereby preserving the system's coherence against environmental and social Temporal Pressure (Γ).
  philosophy: |
    This concept reframes a human life not as a series of discrete choices, but as a continuous, path-integral optimization. It asserts that agency is the art of navigating a pre-existing landscape of pressure, and wisdom is the ability to find paths that resonate with both self and society.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Human Geodesic is the trajectory of a resonant system (Ki) through the manifold of Temporal Pressure (Γ) that extremizes the Pirouette Action (S_p). This path represents the system's continuous optimization to maintain maximal internal coherence. In a social context, it is the individual's worldline as shaped by the geometric landscape of culture, reciprocity (Wound Channels), and ritualized entrainment.
operational_definition:
  units: The path itself is a sequence of states. The associated action S_p is measured in Joule-seconds (J·s).

        outline: |
          Longitudinally track an individual's state vector (e.g., physiological stress markers, communication patterns, resource allocation) over time. Simultaneously map the local Temporal Pressure field (e.g., social obligations, environmental stressors). The observed trajectory, when filtered for noise, approximates the Human Geodesic.

    excerpt: |
      In the Pirouette Framework, a human being is a complex resonant system (Ki) perpetually navigating a landscape of social and environmental Temporal Pressure (Γ). The fundamental drive of any individual, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), is to follow a path of maximal coherence—a geodesic that best preserves their internal integrity.

    excerpt: |
      A society is a higher-order coherence manifold, an impossibly intricate tapestry formed by the constructive and destructive interference of trillions of these intersecting geodesics and their geometric records, or Wound Channels. Culture is the persistent, large-scale geometry of this manifold. To be a member of a culture is to inherit a map of its most stable currents—a pre-carved landscape of efficient paths toward coherence.

  candidates:
    - target: Geodesic Equation (d²x^μ / dτ² + Γ^μ_αβ (dx^α/dτ)(dx^β/dτ) = 0)

      mapping_kind: mathematical
      equation_hint: |
        δS = δ∫L dt = 0  =>  The principle of stationary action defines the path.
      justification: |
        The Human Geodesic is defined as a path of extremal action (maximal coherence), analogous to a geodesic in GR being a path of extremal proper time. The landscape of Temporal Pressure (Γ) provides the effective "curvature" of the state space, analogous to the Christoffel symbols (Γ^μ_αβ) representing spacetime curvature.

      rationale: The mapping is direct and conceptually powerful. It allows the importation of geometric and variational tools from physics to model social dynamics, which is the core goal of DOMA-045.

  claims:
    - statement: "An individual's life trajectory, when modeled as a path through a measurable state space of social and environmental pressure, will preferentially follow paths that minimize the time-integrated magnitude of pressure gradients."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Longitudinal studies show that individuals' trajectories are better modeled as random walks or are uncorrelated with measurable fields of social and environmental pressure."

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a purely spatial geodesic (shortest path between two points), the Human Geodesic is a worldline in a state space defined by both external (Γ) and internal (Ki) parameters. It optimizes for *coherence over time* (extremizes the action S_p), not minimal distance.
