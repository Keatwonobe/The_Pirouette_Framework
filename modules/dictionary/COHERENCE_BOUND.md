        Coherence Bound: An estimate of the maximum potential coherence loss incurred by using the template. This is the known risk, the guaranteed "safety margin" that makes the shortcut viable.

  art: |
    The price of speed, willingly paid. It's the calculated shadow a shortcut must cast, the known deviation from a perfect path that makes timely arrival possible.
  law: |
    For any Geodesic Template T, its Coherence Bound ε_K is the maximum difference in coherence (ΔKτ) between the outcome of the template's prescribed action and the outcome of the optimal action derived from the full Pirouette Lagrangian, over the template's defined trigger conditions. Formally, ε_K = max(|Kτ(T) - Kτ(Lagrangian)|) for all states within the trigger domain.
  philosophy: |
    To act in the real world is to accept imperfection. The Coherence Bound transforms this from a passive acceptance into a strategic choice, quantifying the trade-off between optimality and velocity and ensuring that heuristics remain tools of disciplined wisdom, not reckless guessing.
pirouette_definition: |
  The estimated maximum potential coherence loss incurred from using a Geodesic Template instead of a full Lagrangian analysis. It is a pre-calculated safety margin, representing the worst-case scenario for coherence degradation when applying a given heuristic within its specified trigger conditions. This value quantifies the known, acceptable risk of using a computational shortcut, ensuring that the pursuit of efficiency does not lead to catastrophic system failure. It is a mandatory component of every Geodesic Template, calibrated during its forging process.

        outline: |
          1. Define the set of trigger conditions for the Geodesic Template.
          2. For a representative sample of scenarios within these conditions, simulate two paths: (a) the path taken by applying the template's heuristic action, and (b) the optimal path calculated from a full Pirouette Lagrangian analysis (the 'ground truth').
          3. Measure the final coherence Kτ for both outcomes.
          4. The Coherence Bound ε_K is the supremum of the observed absolute differences |Kτ(a) - Kτ(b)| across all tested scenarios.
        expected_signals: [A distribution of |ΔKτ| values bounded by ε_K.]
        pitfalls: [Insufficient sampling of the trigger condition space leading to an underestimated bound, numerical errors in the Lagrangian 'ground truth' simulation.]

    excerpt: |
      No simplification is perfect. This final step assesses the "cost of being wrong." We estimate the maximum potential coherence loss incurred by using the template instead of a full Lagrangian analysis. This is the known, acceptable price of speed, ensuring that efficiency never leads to catastrophic failure.

      Each Geodesic Template is a codified piece of wisdom...formally defined by three components: 1. Trigger Condition... 2. Prescribed Action... 3. Coherence Bound: An estimate of the maximum potential coherence loss incurred by using the template. This is the known risk, the guaranteed "safety margin" that makes the shortcut viable.

  candidates:
    - target: Error term in approximation theory (e.g., O(h^n))
      domain: Math
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      equation_hint: |
        f(x) ≈ P_n(x) + R_n(x), where |R_n(x)| ≤ ε
      justification: |
        The Coherence Bound is analogous to the error term or remainder in an approximation, such as a Taylor series. It quantifies the maximum deviation from the "true" function (the Lagrangian path) when using a simpler, truncated model (the heuristic).

      confidence: 0.8
    - target: Robustness margin (e.g., phase/gain margin)
      domain: Control Theory
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The Coherence Bound acts as a guaranteed margin of safety. It ensures that even with the simplified heuristic, the system's performance (coherence) will not degrade beyond a specified limit, analogous to how a phase margin ensures controller stability despite model uncertainties or perturbations.
      references: []
      confidence: 0.7
  adopted:
    - target: Error Term in approximation theory
      rationale: The mapping is direct and conceptually clean. The Pirouette Lagrangian represents the "true" function, the Geodesic Template is the "approximating function," and the Coherence Bound is the guaranteed maximum error (ε) of that approximation over a defined domain.
      confidence: 0.8
constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A Geodesic Template with a Coherence Bound of ε_K will never, under its specified trigger conditions, cause a coherence loss greater than ε_K relative to the optimal Lagrangian path."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "Observing a single instance where a ratified template, operating within its trigger conditions, produces a coherence outcome Kτ_template such that |Kτ_template - Kτ_lagrangian| > ε_K. This would invalidate the bound's calibration."

  disambiguation: |
    The Coherence Bound is not a statistical confidence interval or a measure of uncertainty in the *measurement* of coherence. It is a deterministic, pre-calculated upper limit on the *performance degradation* incurred by using a specific heuristic instead of a full calculation.
