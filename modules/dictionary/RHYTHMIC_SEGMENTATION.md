        The first step is to divide the continuous information stream into a series of discrete temporal windows. This is the "sieve's mesh." The size of this window is a critical parameter, chosen to match the scale of the phenomena being investigated.

    To hear the river's song, one must first choose how to listen—setting the mesh of the sieve to catch the moments that matter.
  law: |
    Any continuous information stream must be partitioned into discrete temporal windows before its Coherence Profile can be computed; the scale of discoverable patterns is constrained by the window size.
  philosophy: |
    Discretizing a continuous flow is the foundational act of analysis. The choice of window size is not a neutral technical parameter but a theoretical commitment that defines the scale at which phenomena are permitted to exist.

  The initial protocol stage of partitioning a continuous information stream into a series of discrete, sequential temporal windows. The window size (`Δt_w`) is a critical parameter, set either to a fixed duration to probe for specific frequencies or adapted dynamically to capture events at their natural timescale. This process transforms an unanalyzable flow into a sequence of finite segments, enabling subsequent Coherence Profiling.

      - name: Fixed Window Segmentation
        outline: |
          Partition a continuous time-series stream `S(t)` into a set of `n` non-overlapping segments `{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n}`, where each segment `s_i` corresponds to a fixed time interval `Δt_w`. This method is optimal for detecting patterns at a known, consistent frequency.
        expected_signals: [A sequence of discrete, equal-length data windows.]
        pitfalls: [Choosing a `Δt_w` that is too large may average out and miss short-lived phenomena (e.g., turbulent eddies). Choosing one that is too small may fail to capture long-period coherent patterns (e.g., laminar channels).]
      - name: Adaptive Window Segmentation
        outline: |
          Dynamically adjust the window size `Δt_w` based on real-time stream diagnostics (e.g., `flow_diagnostics` from DYNA-001). Decrease `Δt_w` in regions of high Dissonance (`Γ`) to increase temporal resolution, and increase it in regions of high Coherence (`Kτ`) to capture stable structures.
        expected_signals: [A sequence of variable-length data windows, capturing events at their natural timescale.]
        pitfalls: [Requires a robust feedback loop and can introduce algorithmic complexity. Poorly tuned adaptive logic can lead to unstable windowing or misinterpretation of signal boundaries.]

      justification: |
        The process of dividing a signal into short-time segments for analysis is the core principle of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and other time-frequency analysis methods. The choice of window size (`Δt_w`) directly corresponds to the trade-off between time and frequency resolution, a central constraint in both domains. Rhythmic Segmentation is the Pirouette-native implementation of this universal signal processing technique.

        The act of segmenting a data stream and calculating aggregate properties (like `Kτ` and `Γ`) for each segment is conceptually identical to coarse-graining a microstate to derive a macrostate. The window size `Δt_w` is the temporal coarse-graining scale that defines the boundary between the resolved "macroscopic" dynamics and the unresolved "microscopic" noise.

# Rhythmic Segmentation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The initial protocol stage of partitioning a continuous information stream into a series of discrete, sequential temporal windows. The window size (`Δt_w`) is a critical parameter, set either to a fixed duration to probe for specific frequencies or adapted dynamically to capture events at their natural timescale. This process transforms an unanalyzable flow into a sequence of finite segments, enabling subsequent Coherence Profiling.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, Rhythmic Segmentation is analogous to the application of a windowing function in time-frequency analysis (e.g., Short-Time Fourier Transform), which discretizes a signal to analyze its local frequency content. Conceptually, it mirrors the process of coarse-graining in statistical mechanics, where a microstate is averaged over a chosen temporal scale (`Δt_w`) to define a macroscopic state whose properties (`Kτ`, `Γ`) can be tracked. The choice of window size imposes a direct trade-off between time and frequency resolution, a manifestation of the uncertainty principle.
