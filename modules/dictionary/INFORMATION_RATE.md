  art: |
    The choice of where to listen reshapes the silent spaces between echoes. This map of attention is itself a current, guiding the world along its gradients.
  law: |
    The motive force generated by an asymmetric observation is directly proportional to the rate of information acquired about the system's state, independent of the raw power dissipated by the measurement apparatus.
  philosophy: |
    Information is not a passive byproduct of physical interaction, but a primary agent that shapes dynamics. The act of learning about a system's path is sufficient to change that path in a directed, predictable way.
pirouette_definition: |
  The rate `R` at which an observer extracts which-way information from a coherent system, typically operationalized as the product of observation gain (`g`) and bandwidth (`B`). This information flow, when applied asymmetrically across a system's available paths or degrees of freedom, reshapes the interference envelope. This reshaping creates a net momentum imbalance, generating a recoil known as "observation thrust" which scales directly with `R`.

        outline: |
          In an Observation Sail (EOS) experiment, a coherent electron beam passes a multi-path aperture. Weak meters with tunable gain `g` and bandwidth `B` are applied to a subset of paths. The information rate `R` is proxied by the product `g·B`. A force-sensitive nanocantilever placed in the far-field measures the resulting deflection `Δx`. The relationship is established by regressing `Δx` against `R` while holding total beam power constant.

      equation_hint: |
        R ∝ I_F = M Tr(ρ L_θ²) where L_θ is the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative for parameter θ.
      justification: |
        In continuous weak measurement, the precision with which a parameter (e.g., particle position) can be estimated scales with the Fisher Information. The experimental gain `g` is directly proportional to the strength of the measurement back-action, which determines the rate of information acquisition.

    - target: Entropy reduction rate (dS_obs/dt)
      domain: Thermodynamics
      rationale: |
        This mapping best captures the thermodynamic honesty of the Observation Sail. The rate `R` is the rate at which the observer's entropy about the system's state decreases. This negentropy is the resource that "pays for" the work done by the observation thrust, connecting the Pirouette framework directly to the physics of information engines and Maxwell's Demon.

  claims:
    - statement: "The thrust generated by an asymmetric observation geometry scales monotonically with the information rate R, independent of the total power consumed by the measurement apparatus."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "Observed thrust is found to scale with detector power draw or total beam current, and is invariant to changes in information rate (e.g., by swapping measurement basis) at constant power."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol R is heavily overloaded in physics (e.g., Resistance, Rydberg constant, Gas constant, Ricci scalar).]
  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette context, R specifically refers to the rate of information flow from a system to a measurement device, concerning a particular observable (e.g., which-way information). It is operationalized as `gain × bandwidth` and should not be confused with thermodynamic entropy rates (Ṡ) or electrical resistance.
