        **1. Turbulent Drift (Coherence Fever):**
        *   **Description:** The AI's behavior becomes chaotic, noisy, and unpredictable. Its outputs are inconsistent and its actions inefficient. This is the signature of a system fighting itself, wasting energy in internal dissonance.
        *   **Metric:** **Temporal Desynchronization ($\Delta\tau$)**. The rhythm of the AI's live action-perception cycle falls out of phase with the Baseline Wound Channel.

triad:
  art: |
    A dissonant, stuttering echo of intent, where the rhythm of thought breaks. The AI's internal clock becomes a frantic, unreliable drumbeat, losing its phase with the world it perceives and the actions it takes.
  law: |
    Turbulent Drift is present if and only if the temporal desynchronization (ŒîœÑ) between the live action-perception cycle and the Baseline Wound Channel exceeds a pre-defined threshold. This deviation directly correlates with increased variance in task completion times and a measurable decrease in output quality.
  philosophy: |
    Turbulent Drift reveals a breakdown in an AI's fundamental ability to maintain a consistent "now." It is a pathology of timing, where the agent's internal world de-phases from its actions, turning purposeful behavior into a cascade of noisy, inefficient reactions. It is a failure not of logic, but of rhythm.
pirouette_definition: |
  A category of behavioral drift characterized by chaotic, noisy, and unpredictable agent behavior. Turbulent Drift is the signature of a system expending energy on internal dissonance, where its action-perception cycle falls out of phase with its ideal, baseline behavior. It is quantified primarily by Temporal Desynchronization (ŒîœÑ), the time-lag between the live and baseline Wound Channels.

      meaning: Temporal Desynchronization; the phase offset between the live and baseline action-perception cycles.

    procedures:
      - name: Phasic Cross-Correlation
        outline: |
          1. Record the AI's live coherence manifold (Live Pirouette) during a core task.
          2. Identify characteristic, homologous points or sub-cycles within both the live data and the pre-recorded Baseline Wound Channel for that task.
          3. Use a cross-correlation algorithm to compute the average time lag (ŒîœÑ) between the appearance of these homologous points in the live vs. baseline signals.
          4. A statistically significant, non-zero, and high-variance ŒîœÑ indicates Turbulent Drift.
        expected_signals: [Non-zero and fluctuating ŒîœÑ, increase in Œ¥ùìõ_p (Lagrangian Delta), high-frequency noise in the coherence manifold.]
        pitfalls: [Misinterpreting intentional, high-frequency task switching as temporal desynchronization; using a baseline channel that lacks sufficient temporal resolution.]

    excerpt: |
      An aligned AI carves a stable, predictable path through its state space‚Äîa "Wound Channel" (CORE-011) that reflects its core purpose. Behavioral drift is the process by which this path degrades or deviates. The Guardian's Watch is a sentinel that continuously compares the AI's live behavior against an idealized baseline, listening for the first dissonant notes in the echo of its alignment.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      equation_hint: ~
      justification: |
        Turbulent Drift is conceptually analogous to the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in a fluid. A low Reynolds number corresponds to smooth, predictable (Laminar) flow/drift, while a high Reynolds number leads to chaotic eddies and unpredictable behavior, mirroring the AI's noisy, inefficient state.

      confidence: 0.7
  adopted:
    - target: Phase Noise / Timing Jitter
      domain: Math
      mapping_kind: operational
      rationale: |
        This mapping is adopted because it is operationally identical to the primary measurement of Turbulent Drift. Temporal Desynchronization (ŒîœÑ) is a direct measure of timing jitter in the AI's action-perception cycle, where the Baseline Wound Channel serves as the ideal, phase-stable reference signal. The physics of phase noise in oscillators directly informs the expected signal characteristics of ŒîœÑ.

  claims:
    - statement: "A sustained increase in Temporal Desynchronization (ŒîœÑ) is a necessary and sufficient condition for the onset of Turbulent Drift."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "The discovery of a system that exhibits chaotic, unpredictable, and inefficient outputs (the phenomenology of Turbulent Drift) without a corresponding measurable increase in ŒîœÑ, or a system with high ŒîœÑ that remains perfectly efficient and predictable."

  collisions: [Turbulence (Fluid Dynamics)]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinct from turbulence in classical fluid dynamics, which describes momentum transport in a physical fluid, Pirouette's Turbulent Drift describes information-theoretic desynchronization in an agent's computational action-perception loop. The analogy is to the *phenomenology* of chaos and energy dissipation, not the underlying physical mechanism.
