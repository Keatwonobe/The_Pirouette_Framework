      snippet: |
        The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) posits that all dynamics in the universe are the result of systems following geodesics on a manifold of coherence. This module serves as the first and most critical test of that claim. We will now use this single Lagrangian as an engine to derive the three great forces of nature—electromagnetism, the strong force, and gravity...

  art: |
    A single engine powers the universe, expressing itself in three modes. It is the propagating current that connects, the confining gladiator that binds, and the resonant echo that proves its own existence.
  law: |
    The propagating force (electromagnetism) and the confining force (strong/gravity) are derivable as distinct operational modes from the single Pirouette Lagrangian. This unified derivation must predict the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (a_e) to within the precision of the fine-structure constant (α).
  philosophy: |
    The Engine replaces the Standard Model's disjointed "zoo" of forces with a single, unbroken causal chain. It asserts that the universe's apparent complexity is not fundamental, but an emergent consequence of one underlying principle: the maximization of coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Unified Force Engine is the conceptual framework and set of derivations showing how the universe's fundamental forces emerge from the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). It operates in three distinct but unified modes:
  1.  **Propagating (The Current):** Derives electromagnetism from asymmetries in a particle's temporal resonance, with E and B fields as geometric features (gradient and curl) of the coherence manifold.
  2.  **Confining (The Gladiator):** Derives the strong force and gravity from a non-linear, scale-dependent feedback in the Lagrangian, creating "arenas" of stability at quantum and cosmological scales.
  3.  **Self-Interacting (The Echo):** Validates the entire framework by deriving the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) as a topological feature of its own resonance interacting with its past.

          1. Formally derive the topological constant for a two-cycle resonance (electron spin), which yields a baseline g-factor of 2.
          2. Calculate the first-order self-interaction term ("echo") in the Pirouette Lagrangian for this topology.
          3. The resulting correction term should be equivalent to α/2π.
          4. Compare the derived value of a_e with the experimentally measured value from Penning trap experiments.
        expected_signals: [Precise match between the derived a_e and the experimental value.]
        pitfalls: [Higher-order "echo" terms may be required for full precision, misidentification of the correct topological form for the electron.]

    excerpt: |
      The Electric Field (E) is the gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian (E∝∇L_p). A particle in an electric field is "coherence surfing" down the steepest slope of the manifold. The Magnetic Field (B) is the curl, or rotational shear, in the manifold created by a moving charge (B∝∇×A_p). The Lorentz force is the natural, curved path a particle must take to navigate this temporal vortex while maximizing its coherence.

      While electromagnetism describes how systems interact, the Gladiator Force describes why they form structures at all. At the sub-atomic scale, this feedback is extreme...The "cost" of coherence becomes infinite with distance, trapping them. At the cosmic scale, the same principle operates...An orbiting planet is not being pulled; it is following the geodesic—the path of least resistance and maximal coherence—within this well.
  - module: INST-PHYS-001
    excerpt: |
      The tiny deviation from g-2 is caused by the electron's resonance interacting with the "wake" or "echo" of its own immediate past in the coherence manifold. The predicted value of this anomaly (a_e) is simply the product of the interaction's intrinsic strength (the fine-structure constant, α) and the geometry of a single echo cycle (1/2π). a_e = (g-2)/2 = α/2π ≈ 0.0011614

        The Engine derives electromagnetism from the geometry of the coherence manifold, treating E and B fields as the gradient and curl of the underlying Lagrangian/potential, respectively. This maps conceptually to the gauge theory formulation where forces arise from local symmetries.

        The 'Gladiator Force' at the cosmological scale describes gravity as geodesic motion within a 'coherence well' created by mass. This is conceptually identical to GR's formulation of gravity as particles following geodesics in spacetime curved by mass-energy.

        The Engine's prediction for the electron anomaly via a 'self-echo' is a direct operational map to the first-order Schwinger term in the QED calculation of g-2. Both identify the fine-structure constant α as the coupling and 1/2π as a geometric factor from a single loop/cycle.

# Unified Force Engine

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Unified Force Engine is the conceptual framework and set of derivations showing how the universe's fundamental forces emerge from the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). It operates in three distinct but unified modes:
1.  **Propagating (The Current):** Derives electromagnetism from asymmetries in a particle's temporal resonance, with E and B fields as geometric features (gradient and curl) of the coherence manifold.
2.  **Confining (The Gladiator):** Derives the strong force and gravity from a non-linear, scale-dependent feedback in the Lagrangian, creating "arenas" of stability at quantum and cosmological scales.
3.  **Self-Interacting (The Echo):** Validates the entire framework by deriving the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) as a topological feature of its own resonance interacting with its past.

## EFT-First Summary
The Unified Force Engine is a proposed framework that derives low-energy effective forces from a single underlying Lagrangian. It maps conceptually to the Standard Model's U(1) and SU(3) forces and to General Relativity's description of gravity as geodesic motion. Its key testable prediction is an operational mapping to the QED calculation of the electron's anomalous magnetic moment, asserting that the first-order Schwinger term, a_e = α/2π, is a fundamental geometric consequence of particle self-interaction.
