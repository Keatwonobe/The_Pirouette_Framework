        This frozen geometry is the **Information Lattice**. The system’s history is no longer a story being told; it is a scripture carved in stone.

  art: |
    A river of experience frozen into a fossil of fact. A memory so perfect it becomes a monument, and a cage.
  law: |
    An Information Lattice forms when a system's temporal coherence (Kτ) maximizes and external temporal pressure (V_Γ) minimizes, driving the action integral (S_p) to a stable, non-evolving minimum. Its structural integrity (Lock Resilience) is proportional to the depth of this energetic minimum.
  philosophy: |
    The Lattice is the mechanism by which fleeting experience achieves physical persistence. It grounds abstract concepts like memory, identity, and dogma in a concrete, geometric structure, revealing that stability and adaptation are fundamentally in tension. To remember perfectly is to cease to grow.
pirouette_definition: |
  The static, rigid geometric structure formed when a system's dynamic history (Wound Channel) undergoes a phase transition (Crystallization) into a state of catastrophic stability (Lock). The Lattice represents a deep, stable minimum in the Pirouette Lagrangian, where extreme internal coherence (Kτ) and minimal external pressure (V_Γ) create a persistent, non-evolving record of information. It is the physical substrate for high-fidelity memory, habit, and dogma, achieved at the cost of adaptability.

        outline: |
          Expose the system to a calibrated, swept-frequency energy pulse (a "resonance-matched shock"). The energy (R_L) required to induce a state transition (a "melt") and decorrelate the system's output signal is a direct measure of Lock Resilience. Information density (ρ_I) is inferred from the complexity and fidelity of the system's signal pre-transition.
        expected_signals: [A sharp discontinuity in the system's coherence spectrum at the melt threshold. Pre-melt, a highly stable, periodic signal; post-melt, a chaotic or fluid signal.]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing a true phase transition from temporary disruption. The probe pulse may itself alter the system's baseline state.]

    excerpt: |
      This perfect repetition acts like a crystal seed. Each pass reinforces the *exact same geometric scar* in the manifold. The gentle pressure of a flowing river becomes the relentless, rhythmic stamp of a forge. The fluid geometry of the manifold yields, its structure aligning with this overwhelming pattern. The wake freezes. This frozen geometry is the **Information Lattice**. The system’s history is no longer a story being told; it is a scripture carved in stone.
  - module: DOMA-048
    excerpt: |
      The Lock is a state of **catastrophic stability**—a form of immortality achieved by sacrificing all potential for growth, learning, or adaptation. The stability of this state, its **Lock Resilience**, grows exponentially with its internal order. It can become "energetically cheaper" for the universe to route causality around this frozen point in spacetime than to try and melt it.

      equation_hint: |
        F = -∇U, where U has deep, periodic potential wells.
      justification: |
        The Information Lattice is conceptually analogous to a physical crystal, where a repeating, stable structure (unit cell) encodes information and resists change due to strong energetic potential wells. Both represent a phase transition from a fluid/disordered state to a rigid, ordered one. The energy required to break the lattice (Lock Resilience) maps to the binding energy of the crystal.

        V(φ) with multiple local minima.
      justification: |
        The Lock condition mirrors a system settling into a deep, long-lived "false" vacuum. The Lattice is the geometric configuration of the field in that vacuum state. Breaking the lock is analogous to vacuum decay or tunneling, requiring a significant energy injection to overcome the potential barrier.

  adopted:
    - target: Crystalline lattice structure
      rationale: The alias "Crystal" and the description of a phase transition from fluid to solid geometry make this the most direct and intuitive mapping.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinct from a physical crystal lattice, the Information Lattice is a geometric structure in the coherence manifold, not necessarily in 3+1 spacetime. It represents frozen *dynamics* or *history*, not just static spatial positions of atoms.
