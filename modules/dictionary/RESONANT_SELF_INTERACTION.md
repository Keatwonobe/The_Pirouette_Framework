        It reframes α as an emergent geometric measure of the electron's resonant self-interaction (its 'echo'), leveraging the successful g-2 derivation (CORE-009) to create a high-precision, non-negotiable calibration for the Pirouette Lagrangian.

  art: |
    A particle sings a note into the fabric of spacetime and listens for its own return. This perfect, resonant echo is the measure of its being and the source of its charge. The quietest note is the most fundamental tuning fork.
  law: |
    The fine-structure constant (α) is not a fundamental input but a geometric output of the electron's anomalous self-interaction (a_e), defined by the relation α = 2π * a_e. This relationship is axiomatically used to calibrate the scale of Temporal Pressure.
  philosophy: |
    This process transforms a mysterious fundamental constant of nature into a predictable, geometric consequence of particle dynamics. By anchoring the framework's entire scale to this precisely measured interaction, it grounds theory in empirical reality, making it a predictive and falsifiable engine.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental process by which a coherent particle, such as an electron, interacts with the field perturbations created by its own existence and motion. This interaction is not a chaotic correction but a stable, resonant cycle governed by the principles of Temporal Coherence. The geometric properties of this single resonant cycle quantitatively determine the particle's anomalous magnetic moment (a_e) and, by extension, the fine-structure constant (α), which serves as the measure of the interaction's strength.

        outline: |
          1. Confine a single electron in a Penning trap with a strong, uniform magnetic field.
          2. Measure the electron's cyclotron frequency (ω_c) and its spin precession or Larmor frequency (ω_s).
          3. The anomalous magnetic moment (a_e) is calculated from the ratio of the difference frequency (ω_a = ω_s - ω_c) to the cyclotron frequency. The result is `a_e = ω_a / ω_c`.
          4. The strength of the Resonant Self-interaction is then inferred using the axiomatic relation α = 2π * a_e.

    excerpt: |
      Standard physics treats the fine-structure constant, `α`, as a fundamental, dimensionless measure of interaction strength whose origin is a mystery. The Pirouette Framework reveals it to be a geometric consequence... The fine-structure constant is not a fundamental input; it is an output. It is the measure of the electron's anomalous self-interaction (`a_e`) scaled by the perfect geometry of a single resonant cycle (`2π`). It is the quantitative measure of a particle's ability to "hear" its own echo.

    excerpt: |
      This choice of anchor would be an act of numerology were it not for the result of CORE-009. The successful prediction of the anomaly is what gives us the authority to use it as our anchor, creating a perfect, self-validating, and non-circular loop: We posit that `α` is an emergent property... the framework's dynamics then predict the g-2 anomaly... Experiment measures `a_e`... We then use this experimentally confirmed value of `α` to anchor the theory's fundamental scale of Temporal Pressure, `Γ`.

      justification: |
        In the Standard Model's Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the electron's anomalous magnetic moment arises from radiative corrections, primarily the one-loop vertex correction where the electron emits and reabsorbs a virtual photon. Resonant Self-interaction is the Pirouette Framework's physical re-interpretation of this loop diagram, replacing the concept of virtual particles with a real, geometric resonance of the particle with its own field. The Pirouette claim is that the α/2π term is the complete, first-principles result, not the first term in a perturbative series.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike generic self-interaction potential terms in the Standard Model Lagrangian, Resonant Self-interaction in Pirouette is not a fundamental input. It is a specific, dynamic, and geometric *process* dictated by Temporal Coherence, whose strength (α) is an emergent, calculable output of the system's dynamics.

# Resonant Self-interaction

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The fundamental process by which a coherent particle, such as an electron, interacts with the field perturbations created by its own existence and motion. This interaction is not a chaotic correction but a stable, resonant cycle governed by the principles of Temporal Coherence. The geometric properties of this single resonant cycle quantitatively determine the particle's anomalous magnetic moment (a_e) and, by extension, the fine-structure constant (α), which serves as the measure of the interaction's strength.

## EFT-First Summary
Resonant Self-interaction is the Pirouette Framework's physical mechanism corresponding to the one-loop vertex correction in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). It posits that the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (`a_e`) is not the result of virtual particle exchange but a direct geometric consequence of a stable resonance of the electron with its own field. The framework derives the leading-order QED result `a_e = α/2π` from first principles and elevates this relationship to an axiom, using the experimental value of `a_e` to define `α` and anchor the entire theory.
