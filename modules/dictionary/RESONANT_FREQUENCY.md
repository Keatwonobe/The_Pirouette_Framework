  art: |
    The heartbeat of a thing; the natural tempo at which its existence sings. A high, clear note is a stable system; a wavering tone is one on the verge of decoherence.
  law: |
    The Resonant Frequency ω_k is the angular frequency (2π/τ_p) of a system's Pirouette Cycle. Along with Time Adherence (T_a), it is a primary determinant of Temporal Coherence (K_τ), and systems evolve to maximize K_τ against environmental Temporal Pressure.
  philosophy: |
    Resonant Frequency grounds the abstract concept of 'coherence' in a measurable, physical quantity. It posits that every stable pattern, from a particle to a galaxy, has a characteristic rhythm, and that this rhythm is not a byproduct of its existence but the very engine of its persistence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental angular frequency of a system's autopoietic cycle, denoted ω_k. It is mathematically defined as the reciprocal of the system's Pirouette Cycle duration (τ_p) scaled by 2π (ω_k = 2π/τ_p). As a key component of Temporal Coherence (K_τ), a higher Resonant Frequency contributes to a system's stability and persistence.

          1. Isolate the system 'k' from overwhelming external pressures or entrainment signals.
          2. Identify the fundamental period (τ_p) of its primary autopoietic cycle via spectral analysis of its emissions or internal state fluctuations.
          3. Calculate ω_k = 2π / τ_p.

    excerpt: |
      A system will naturally adjust its state (its Ki, and therefore its ω_k and T_a) to find the "sweet spot"—the state of highest possible internal coherence for the lowest environmental cost. This is the mathematical formalization of the "path of least resistance" described in CORE-004.

        The Compton frequency represents the intrinsic angular frequency of a particle at rest, linking its mass directly to a temporal property. This aligns with ω_k as a fundamental internal rhythm of a system, suggesting that mass in the Standard Model could be an emergent property of a system's Resonant Frequency.

# Resonant Frequency

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The fundamental angular frequency of a system's autopoietic cycle, denoted ω_k. It is mathematically defined as the reciprocal of the system's Pirouette Cycle duration (τ_p) scaled by 2π (ω_k = 2π/τ_p). As a key component of Temporal Coherence (K_τ), a higher Resonant Frequency contributes to a system's stability and persistence.

## EFT-First Summary
No direct mapping to an Effective Field Theory (EFT) term has been ratified. However, `ω_k` is conceptually analogous to intrinsic frequencies in quantum mechanics like the Compton frequency, where a particle's mass is treated as a measure of its internal oscillatory rate. In this view, a system's inertia emerges from the "stiffness" of its internal rhythm.
