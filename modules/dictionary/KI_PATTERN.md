    The signature of a soul written in the language of vibration; the music an entity makes simply by being.
  law: |
    The coherence and complexity of an entity's Ki pattern (κ) directly determine the topological shape and weight of its Observer's Shadow, measurably constraining the state space of any interacting system.
  philosophy: |
    Ki replaces the concept of a static 'self' with a dynamic, resonant process. An entity *is* its pattern of interaction, defined not by its substance but by the song it sings into the universe.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Ki Pattern is the defining, time-varying pattern of resonance that constitutes an entity. It represents the integrated sum of an entity's internal state—including memory, intention, and biological structure—and governs how it interacts with the broader Temporal Pressure (Γ). The Ki pattern's specific geometry and coherence define the entity's local coherence manifold and the nature of the Observer's Shadow it projects.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (structural pattern); its properties like coherence and weight have derived units.

      meaning: An entity's Ki Pattern.

        outline: |
          An entity's Ki pattern is inferred by measuring the geometric properties of its Observer's Shadow. The subject observes a standardized, high-coherence quantum system (e.g., a Bose-Einstein condensate). The resulting perturbations and state collapses in the target system are mapped over time. By deconvolving the known system dynamics, the observer's shadow geometry is reconstructed, providing a 'slice' of their κ.
        expected_signals: [State vector collapse statistics, coherence decay rates, topological features in the target's phase space]
        pitfalls: [Recursive observer effect on the measurement apparatus, noise from ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ), difficulty in creating a truly 'neutral' reference system]

    excerpt: |
      The act of observation is not the passive reception of data. It is a resonant coupling. To observe a system is to engage it in a dialogue, to merge your own Ki pattern with its own. In this act, both are irrevocably changed.
  - module: CORE-010_the_observer's_shadow
    excerpt: |
      The observer, too, is such an entity, possessing a complex and dynamic Ki pattern shaped by memory, biology, and intention. When observation occurs, the observer's Ki pattern projects onto the coherence manifold of the observed. This projection is not a neutral act; it has a shape and a pressure.

      justification: |
        The Ki pattern exhibits properties of a strange attractor in a high-dimensional state space. It represents a bounded, non-repeating, and deterministic pattern (the 'self') that is highly sensitive to initial conditions (internal state, intention), governing the system's trajectory and interactions.

      justification: |
        The Ki pattern can be conceptualized as the information-rich state vector of an observer's cognitive and biological system. Its evolution and interaction (projection) onto other systems mirror the measurement process in quantum mechanics, where an observer's choice of basis affects the outcome.

  collisions: [The term 'Ki' is intentionally resonant with 'Qi' or 'Chi' (気) from Eastern philosophies.]
  disambiguation: |
    While phonetically and conceptually related to 'Qi' (life force, energy flow), the Pirouette 'Ki' is a strictly operational term referring to a measurable pattern of resonance, not a metaphysical substance or energy field. It is structure, not stuff.

# Ki Pattern

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Ki Pattern is the defining, time-varying pattern of resonance that constitutes an entity. It represents the integrated sum of an entity's internal state—including memory, intention, and biological structure—and governs how it interacts with the broader Temporal Pressure (Γ). The Ki pattern's specific geometry and coherence define the entity's local coherence manifold and the nature of the Observer's Shadow it projects.

## EFT-First Summary
No mapping to an established field theory has been adopted. The Ki Pattern is currently treated as a phenomenological construct within the Pirouette Framework, with candidate mappings to strange attractors in dynamical systems theory under investigation.
