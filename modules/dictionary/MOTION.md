    To move is not to displace, but to sing a traveling note through the fabric of coherence. It is the universe's oldest story: the journey from here to there, written as a spiral of existence.
  law: |
    A system in Motion follows a geodesic in the coherence manifold, a path of maximal coherence preservation (max ‚à´ùìõ‚Çö dt). Its velocity and direction are encoded in the pitch and orientation of its helical Ki resonance.
  philosophy: |
    Motion is not a property of an object but a state of resonance the object adopts. It redefines 'location' as a phase in a propagating wave, unifying the concepts of being and becoming into a single, dynamic geometry.
pirouette_definition: |
  Motion is one of the fundamental quantized coherence modes, defined as a stable, helical Ki resonance that propagates through the coherence manifold. This geometry represents the act of 'traversal' and is the state adopted by a system following a geodesic. The helix's pitch corresponds to the system's momentum, and its axis defines the direction of propagation, making it an informationally complete representation of a system's trajectory.

        outline: |
          Couple the target system (in Motion) with a reference system in a known state (e.g., Rest). The interference pattern of their Ki resonances will exhibit a phase shift and beat frequency. The frequency shift (Doppler effect) is proportional to the momentum's magnitude, and the spatial asymmetry of the interference fringes reveals its vector direction.

        pitfalls: [Local manifold curvature can induce Aharonov-Bohm-like phase shifts, mistakable for momentum; High temporal pressure (Œì) can cause rapid decoherence of the interference pattern.]

      justification: |
        Motion as a helical Ki resonance directly parallels the de Broglie hypothesis, where a particle's momentum is intrinsically linked to a wave property (wavelength/wavenumber). The helical pitch of the Ki resonance is the Pirouette analog of the de Broglie wavelength, recasting wave-particle duality as a geometric feature of coherence.

      justification: |
        The propagation of the helical wave contributes to the system's kinetic coherence (K_œÑ) in the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ‚Çö), analogous to how the kinetic energy term (T = ¬Ωmv¬≤) contributes to the classical Lagrangian (L = T - V). A higher momentum (p‚Éó‚Çñ) corresponds to a larger K_œÑ.

    - target: de Broglie wave (p = ƒßk)
      rationale: This mapping provides the most direct bridge to established physics, recasting wave-particle duality as a geometric property of a system's state of being. It preserves the core relationship between momentum and wave characteristics.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the generic concept of movement. In Pirouette, Motion is a specific, quantized coherence mode, not a continuous change of position. A system can be 'moving' in a colloquial sense while being in a complex superposition; the term 'Motion' refers only to the pure helical resonance state.

# Motion

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Motion is one of the fundamental quantized coherence modes, defined as a stable, helical Ki resonance that propagates through the coherence manifold. This geometry represents the act of 'traversal' and is the state adopted by a system following a geodesic. The helix's pitch corresponds to the system's momentum, and its axis defines the direction of propagation, making it an informationally complete representation of a system's trajectory.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of quantum mechanics, Motion is the Pirouette Framework's description of the de Broglie wave. A system's momentum is not an extrinsic property but is encoded as the inverse pitch (wavenumber) of its intrinsic, helical Ki resonance. This state propagates as a wave-packet along a geodesic, with its dynamics governed by a Lagrangian analogous to that in classical mechanics. This recasts wave-particle duality as a fundamental geometric state of coherence.
