        Instability begins as a waver. As internal or external pressures mount, the system struggles to maintain this geodesic. The first symptom is **Temporal Jitter (Jτ)**: a micro-variation in the system's once-steady rhythm, the sonic artifact of the system fighting to remain coherent.

  art: |
    The tremor in a held note before the voice cracks. It is the sound of a system struggling to remember its own song under duress, the first hint of dissonance in a formerly perfect chord.
  law: |
    The variance of a system's primary resonant period (`T_Ki`) over short time intervals increases non-linearly as the system approaches a coherence inflection point. Jτ is the normalized standard deviation of this period.
  philosophy: |
    Jτ embodies the principle that catastrophe is not a sudden event, but a process with a measurable onset. It elevates foresight from intuition to a physical property, asserting that every breakdown has a tell-tale signature if one knows how to listen.
pirouette_definition: |
  The micro-scale, high-frequency variation in the timing and periodicity of a system's dominant resonant pattern (`Ki`). Temporal Jitter is the direct precursor to Manifold Drift and serves as the earliest quantifiable indicator that a system is deviating from its geodesic of maximal coherence due to mounting internal or external stress.

          1. Ingest a high-resolution time-series of a core system observable.
          2. Use Fourier, wavelet, or autocorrelation methods to isolate the dominant resonant frequency (`Ki`) and its corresponding period (`T_Ki`).
          3. Over a sliding time window, measure the period of each individual cycle of the `Ki` waveform.
          4. Calculate the standard deviation (`σ_T`) and mean (`<T>`) of the period measurements within the window.
          5. Compute Jτ as the coefficient of variation: Jτ = σ_T / <T>.

    excerpt: |
      By analyzing the micro-dynamics of a system's resonant pattern (`Ki`), the Sentinel detects the "temporal jitter" that signals a struggle for stability. This provides a crucial lead time—an opportunity to intervene, mitigate, or adapt before a brewing crisis becomes an overt catastrophe. It moves the Weaver from a reactive posture to a predictive one, transforming diagnosis into the science of foresight.

      justification: |
        Phase noise is the standard measure for frequency instability in oscillators, quantifying random fluctuations in a signal's phase. This is directly analogous to the micro-variations in a system's rhythm that constitute Temporal Jitter. Both concepts describe the degradation of a periodic signal's spectral purity, serving as a measure of its stability.

  disambiguation: |
    Jτ is a single metric for temporal stability, not the product of two quantities J and τ. It is a generalization of clock jitter from digital electronics, applying to any continuous or discrete resonant system, and is specifically interpreted as a predictive signal of systemic state change, not merely as a signal-to-noise ratio issue.

# Temporal Jitter

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The micro-scale, high-frequency variation in the timing and periodicity of a system's dominant resonant pattern (`Ki`). Temporal Jitter is the direct precursor to Manifold Drift and serves as the earliest quantifiable indicator that a system is deviating from its geodesic of maximal coherence due to mounting internal or external stress.

## EFT-First Summary
Temporal Jitter (Jτ) is the Pirouette Framework's operationalization of phase noise for any complex resonant system. It measures the degradation of a system's spectral purity, providing an early warning of instability. Just as increasing phase noise in an electronic oscillator precedes signal failure, a rise in Jτ signals an impending systemic state transition, quantifying the system's struggle to maintain a stable, coherent rhythm.
