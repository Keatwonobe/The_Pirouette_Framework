        **Stage I: Structural Ingestion**

        First, the artifact's pattern is captured in a universal mathematical format, mapping its domain-specific structure onto a generalized topological space. This strips the form of its original medium.

  art: |
    To perceive the skeleton of a song, the architecture of a thought, stripped bare of flesh and medium. It is the act of seeing the blueprint beneath the building, the geometry within the poetry.
  law: |
    Any artifact, regardless of its medium, must be mapped to a generalized topological space that preserves its relational geometry while discarding substrate-specific properties. The process is successful if and only if the output is directly comparable to the output from any other ingested artifact.
  philosophy: |
    This is the foundational act of universalism, asserting that the language of form transcends the material it is written in. It enables a conversation between a star and a soul by establishing a common ground of pure structure, proving that all things are, at their core, comparable geometries.
pirouette_definition: |
  The first stage of the Universal Translation protocol. Structural Ingestion is the formal process of converting an artifact from its native, domain-specific medium (e.g., sound, text, physical matter) into a universal, substrate-agnostic mathematical format, typically a generalized topological space or vector embedding. This procedure is designed to preserve the artifact's intrinsic relational patterns and structural geometry while discarding all properties of its original medium, thereby preparing it for Coherence Distillation.

      justification: |
        TDA is a method for computing topological features of data represented as a point cloud. Like Structural Ingestion, it abstracts away specific coordinates or metrics to capture the essential "shape" (e.g., loops, voids) of the data. The output, a persistence diagram, is a substrate-agnostic signature of the artifact's form.

        In machine learning, feature extraction converts raw input data (like images or text) into a numerical feature vector suitable for processing by a general-purpose algorithm. This is operationally analogous to converting a domain-specific artifact into a universal mathematical format for analysis.

      rationale: TDA provides the strongest formal and conceptual parallel. Its explicit goal is to produce a substrate-agnostic, coordinate-free representation of "shape," which aligns perfectly with the stated purpose of Structural Ingestion to capture pure form.

  disambiguation: |
    Structural Ingestion is not merely data loading or format conversion. It is a formal transformation that *discards* substrate-specific properties (like the color of an object or the font of a text) to isolate and preserve its underlying relational geometry and topology. The output is not raw data, but a structured mathematical object.

# Structural Ingestion

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The first stage of the Universal Translation protocol. Structural Ingestion is the formal process of converting an artifact from its native, domain-specific medium (e.g., sound, text, physical matter) into a universal, substrate-agnostic mathematical format, typically a generalized topological space or vector embedding. This procedure is designed to preserve the artifact's intrinsic relational patterns and structural geometry while discarding all properties of its original medium, thereby preparing it for Coherence Distillation.

## EFT-First Summary
Structural Ingestion is analogous to Topological Data Analysis (TDA). This process converts raw, high-dimensional data from any source into a simplified topological representation, such as a simplicial complex. The goal is to extract robust, coordinate-free invariants (e.g., Betti numbers, captured in a persistence diagram) that describe the data's fundamental "shape." This provides a universal format for comparing the structure of disparate systems, independent of their specific physical manifestation.
