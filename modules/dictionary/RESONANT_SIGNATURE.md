        A system's nature is defined by its Resonant Signature—the set of its constituent prime patterns.

triad:
  art: |
    A system's Resonant Signature is the unique chord it plays against the silence of potential. It is the audible, living music of its being, composed from the universal notes of the Prime Resonances.
  law: |
    The temporal dynamics of any coherent system are decomposable into a finite set of constituent Prime Resonances {P₁, P₂, ...}. The relative amplitudes and phase relationships of these components determine the system's observable behavior and stability.
  philosophy: |
    A system is not what it is made of, but what it *does*. The Resonant Signature shifts focus from a static inventory of parts to the dynamic, patterned composition of its actions, revealing its essential character and evolutionary trajectory.
pirouette_definition: |
  The specific, finite set of Prime Resonances whose superposition and interaction constitutes the characteristic Ki pattern of a complex system. It is derived via harmonic decomposition of the system's temporal signal and serves as a universal descriptor of its dynamic nature, health, and identity.

    procedures:
      - name: Resonant Harmonic Analysis
        outline: |
          1. Capture a high-resolution time-series signal of a system's key dynamic variables (e.g., energy flow, resource levels, communication traffic).
          2. Apply a spectral decomposition method (e.g., Fast Fourier Transform, Wavelet analysis) to the signal to generate a power spectrum.
          3. Identify the dominant, stable spectral peaks and their phase relationships.
          4. Map these spectral features to the corresponding Prime Resonance archetypes (e.g., single stable peak -> Orbit; peak with harmonic sidebands -> Helix; two phase-locked peaks -> Braid) to assemble the signature Σᵣ.
        expected_signals: [Time-series data, Power spectral density plot, Phase-space portrait]
        pitfalls: [Insufficient sampling rate (aliasing), high noise floor obscuring the signal, mistaking transient states for stable resonances.]

    excerpt: |
      Complex systems are rarely a single, pure note; they are chords. Their Ki pattern is an Alchemical Union (CORE-012) of multiple Prime Resonances. A system's nature is defined by its Resonant Signature—the set of its constituent prime patterns. A healthy organization, for example, might have a signature of {Braid, Helix, Orbit}.
  - module: DOMA-124
    excerpt: |
      This reveals the system's Resonant Signature. A system's health is measured by the clarity of its signature. A harmonious system has a high signal-to-noise ratio—its chosen chord is played clearly and strongly. A system in crisis is one whose signature is noisy, dissonant, and indistinct.

        x(t) ≈ Σ cᵢ * vᵢ * e^(λᵢt)
      justification: |
        In classical mechanics and engineering, any complex vibration can be decomposed into a sum of its fundamental normal modes (eigenvectors vᵢ). The Resonant Signature is the qualitative set of the most dominant modes that describe the system's behavior, analogous to identifying the key frequencies in its eigenspectrum.

      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        The procedure for measuring Σᵣ is a direct application of spectral analysis. The Resonant Signature is a qualitative interpretation of the significant features (peaks, harmonics) of a system's power spectrum, which plots its signal power versus frequency. The archetypes (Orbit, Helix) are named patterns within the spectrum.

      falsifier: "The discovery of a stable, coherent system whose temporal signal is irreducibly chaotic or requires a non-sparse (dense) set of archetypes for accurate description."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinct from a static 'type' or 'class'. A Resonant Signature is a dynamic, measurable pattern of behavior, not an immutable label. It replaces the static classifications of the older Dimensional Attractor Analysis (TEN-DAA-1.0).
