        To the family member or friend assisting in this recovery: your role becomes one of profound trust. You were the Pacesetter. You are now the Spotter. In a gym, a spotter doesn't lift the weight for their partner. They stand ready, offering safety and encouragement, allowing the lifter to confidently approach their limit. That is your purpose now.

    Like a spotter in a gym, you do not lift the weight for them. You stand ready as a guardian of the edge, offering safety and encouragement, allowing them to confidently approach their limit and forge new strength.
  law: |
    The Spotter's primary function is to observe the patient's response to a calibrated stressor, record the resulting Echo Score, and use this feedback to adjust the subsequent stressor, ensuring the patient's work remains within the hormetic zone of adaptive growth.
  philosophy: |
    The Spotter externalizes safety and objective analysis, allowing the patient to internalize trust in their own capacity. This role is a bridge from guided recovery to autonomous resilience, transforming the helper's presence from a pacer into a foundation for confident exploration.
pirouette_definition: |
  The helper's designated role in Phase III recovery, characterized by three primary functions: 1) ensuring safety during the application of hormetic stress (e.g., interval training, resistance work), allowing the patient to operate near their capacity; 2) providing objective, loving feedback to prevent overexertion; and 3) acting as an analyst to interpret feedback from the Coherence Ledger, particularly the Echo Score, to collaboratively calibrate future challenges.

      - name: Spotter Protocol Execution
        outline: |
          1. Pre-session: Review the Coherence Ledger with the patient, noting trends in Resting Heart Rate, Flow Score, and previous Echo Scores to agree on the session's intensity.
          2. During session (Crucible Walk/Resilience Ritual): Actively observe the patient. For intervals, manage time and monitor breathing for signs of excessive strain (e.g., gasping). For resistance, monitor form for smoothness, control, and signs of shaking or breath-holding.
          3. Provide real-time verbal cues ("Breathe out on the effort," "Great form," "That's a perfect set, let's rest").
          4. Post-session: Remind the patient to log their immediate feelings.
          5. 24-hour follow-up: Co-evaluate and log the Echo Score (E_s) based on the patient's report of fatigue, energy, and soreness.
        expected_signals: [Patient breathing rate, observed quality of movement, patient-reported Echo Score]
        pitfalls: [Over-intervening and preventing the patient from experiencing a productive challenge; under-intervening and missing signs of dangerous strain; misinterpreting the Echo Score as a simple measure of "feeling good" rather than as a signal for calibration.]

    excerpt: |
      This is where you shine. The data tells a story. Is their Echo Score consistently low after the Resilience Ritual? Perhaps the number of repetitions is too high. Did their Flow Score drop the day after a Crucible Walk? The ledger is no longer just a record of the past; it is the blueprint for calibrating the next challenge.

      justification: |
        The Spotter functions as the 'Proportional' and 'Derivative' components of a biological feedback loop. They observe the system's immediate response to stress (Proportional gain, e.g., watching form) and analyze the post-stress trend via the Echo Score (Derivative gain) to dampen oscillations and prevent overshooting into a state of harmful strain or injury.

  claims:
    - statement: "A patient-Spotter dyad, properly utilizing the Echo Score to calibrate hormetic stressors, will achieve a statistically significant higher rate of increase in Temporal Coherence (Kτ) and functional capacity metrics than a patient self-guiding with the same protocol."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A randomized trial shows no significant difference in recovery outcomes (e.g., VO2 max, Flow Score stability, strength gains) between the dyad group and the self-guided group over a 12-week period."

  disambiguation: |
    The Spotter role is distinct from the prior 'Pacesetter' role. A Pacesetter helps *establish* a stable, consistent rhythm. A Spotter helps *safely challenge* that rhythm to provoke adaptive growth. The former is about finding the current; the latter is about entering the forge.
