    The universe's song must have the same melody for all dancers, whether they stand still or race alongside a beam of light. Its harmony cannot be a matter of perspective, but an absolute constant of spacetime.
  law: |
    The mathematical form of physical laws, specifically the Pirouette Action `S = ‚à´ d‚Å¥x ‚àö-g ùìõ`, must be identical in all inertial reference frames. This is enforced by ensuring the Lagrangian Density `ùìõ` is constructed as a Lorentz scalar.
  philosophy: |
    Lorentz Invariance guarantees that the Principle of Maximal Coherence is a universal, observer-independent truth, not a parochial feature of a single reference frame. It elevates the framework from a conceptual model to a candidate fundamental theory by grounding it in the rigorous, established language of covariant field theory.
pirouette_definition: |
  The principle that the laws of physics, derived from the invariant Pirouette Action, are the same for all observers in uniform relative motion. This is achieved by constructing the Lagrangian Density from Lorentz scalars and tensors, such as `g^ŒºŒΩ (‚àÇ_Œº C)^* (‚àÇ_ŒΩ C)`, ensuring that the fundamental drive for Maximal Coherence is a universal, not a perspectival, law. This covariance is considered an innate property of a time-first framework, not an external constraint.

      The dancer‚Äôs pirouette must appear just as graceful, the laws governing its stability just as true, whether viewed from the stage or from a passing starship.

        The Pirouette Framework explicitly adopts the core principle of modern physics that the Action must be a Lorentz scalar. The construction of the Lagrangian Density `ùìõ` from scalar products of four-vectors and tensors is the standard, direct method for enforcing this invariance, making this a one-to-one mapping.

  disambiguation: |
    While often used interchangeably in physics discourse, "invariance" technically refers to a quantity that does not change under a transformation (e.g., the value of `c`), while "covariance" refers to the form of an equation retaining its structure under transformation. The Pirouette Framework, like much of physics, uses "Lorentz Invariance" as the umbrella term for the principle that the laws of physics are covariant.

# Lorentz Invariance

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The principle that the laws of physics, derived from the invariant Pirouette Action, are the same for all observers in uniform relative motion. This is achieved by constructing the Lagrangian Density from Lorentz scalars and tensors, such as `g^ŒºŒΩ (‚àÇ_Œº C)^* (‚àÇ_ŒΩ C)`, ensuring that the fundamental drive for Maximal Coherence is a universal, not a perspectival, law. This covariance is considered an innate property of a time-first framework, not an external constraint.

## EFT-First Summary
Lorentz Invariance in the Pirouette Framework is a direct adoption of the Principle of Covariance from standard General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory. The framework enforces this principle by defining dynamics via an Action `S` whose Lagrangian Density `ùìõ` is constructed as a Lorentz scalar. This ensures all derived physics are observer-independent, directly mapping Pirouette dynamics onto the established mathematical structure of modern physics. (Ref: A. Zee, "QFT in a Nutshell", Part I.3)
