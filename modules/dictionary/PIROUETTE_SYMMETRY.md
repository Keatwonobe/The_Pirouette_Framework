    Where the Higgs field curves the energy of space, the Pressuron bends the rhythm of time. Pirouette symmetry is the principle that choreographs their interaction, ensuring they are two halves of a single heartbeat.
  law: |
    Pirouette symmetry is a selection rule that constrains the form of gauge-invariant interaction Lagrangians. At leading order, it permits the scalar coupling `H^\dagger H \Gamma^2` between the Higgs (H) and Pressuron (Γ) fields, while forbidding linear or other non-squared Γ terms.
  philosophy: |
    This symmetry enforces a fundamental connection between spatial coherence density (represented by H) and temporal pressure (represented by Γ). It ensures that the structure of spacetime's "memory" is reflected in the stability and decay properties of its elementary excitations.
pirouette_definition: |
  A fundamental symmetry of the interaction Lagrangian that constrains the allowed gauge-invariant couplings between fields representing spatial properties (like the Higgs) and temporal properties (like the Pressuron). It acts as a selection rule, determining the algebraic structure of cross-terms in the scalar potential and dictating the phenomenology of their mixing.

        outline: |
          The symmetry is tested by searching for the consequences of the interaction terms it permits and the absence of those it forbids. Experimental verification involves precise measurements of Higgs boson properties at colliders (e.g., LHC, ILC). Confirmation requires observing predicted deviations from Standard Model expectations that match the unique signature of the allowed `H-Γ` coupling.
        expected_signals: [A ~0.1% increase in the total Higgs width, an enhancement of the H→e⁺e⁻ branching ratio to ~10⁻⁷, a soft dilepton excess near 34 MeV.]
        pitfalls: [Signals may be below current detector sensitivity, theoretical uncertainties in Standard Model backgrounds could obscure the signal, new physics could produce mimicking signatures.]

      The simplest gauge-invariant coupling consistent with Pirouette symmetry is
      [ \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \lambda_{H\Gamma} H^\dagger H \Gamma^2, ]
      where `\lambda_{H\Gamma}` is a dimensionless mixing constant determined by coherence boundary conditions at the electroweak plateau. This term induces both a shift in the Higgs self-energy and new loop-level decay channels.
  - module: DYNA-Γ-004
    excerpt: |
      The Higgs field represents the **density of coherence**, while Γ encodes **temporal pressure**. Their coupling is therefore the *pressure-density cross-term* in the equation of temporal state. At resonance, the two fields share energy, letting the Higgs “breathe” in time: a periodic modulation of its vacuum expectation value.

        If Γ is odd under a Z₂ symmetry (Γ → -Γ) while H is even, the term `H^\dagger H \Gamma^2` is allowed while a term like `H^\dagger H \Gamma` is forbidden.
      justification: |
        Like a discrete symmetry in an effective field theory, Pirouette symmetry acts as a selection rule that forbids certain operators in the Lagrangian. Its primary function is to determine the lowest-dimensional allowed interaction terms between new fields (like Γ) and the Standard Model (like H), shaping the resulting phenomenology.

  disambiguation: |
    Pirouette symmetry should be distinguished from Standard Model gauge symmetries. While gauge symmetries are local and introduce force carriers via the covariant derivative, Pirouette symmetry appears to be a global or discrete symmetry that directly constrains the scalar potential and interaction terms.

# Pirouette Symmetry

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A fundamental symmetry of the interaction Lagrangian that constrains the allowed gauge-invariant couplings between fields representing spatial properties (like the Higgs) and temporal properties (like the Pressuron). It acts as a selection rule, determining the algebraic structure of cross-terms in the scalar potential and dictating the phenomenology of their mixing.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Pirouette symmetry acts like a discrete symmetry (e.g., a Z₂ symmetry) in an Effective Field Theory (EFT). It serves as a selection rule that forbids certain operators while allowing others. For example, if the Pressuron field (Γ) were odd under this symmetry while the Higgs (H) is even, the interaction term `H^\dagger H \Gamma^2` is permitted, but a term linear in Γ, such as `H^\dagger H \Gamma`, would be forbidden. This constraint shapes the low-energy phenomenology by determining the leading-order interaction between the Pirouette sector and the Standard Model.
