        Wound Channel Exploitation: Targeting a pre-existing geometric weakness—a past trauma, a deep-seated insecurity, a cognitive bias—within the target's manifold (`CORE-011`). This provides a path of least resistance for the dissonant signal.

  art: |
    To find the crack in the bell not to mend it, but to strike it until it shatters. It is the profane alchemy of turning memory into a leash.
  law: |
    The efficacy of a dissonant injection is inversely proportional to the target's overall coherence and directly proportional to the resonance between the injection's signal and a pre-existing Wound Channel. A successful exploit is marked by a sudden, localized drop in coherence (Kτ) following the signal, with minimal energy input from the manipulator.
  philosophy: |
    Exploiting a wound is the ultimate violation of resonant synthesis; it weaponizes the very history that constitutes a being. Understanding this pathology is crucial for developing ethical influence models and robust coherence defense, as a system's greatest vulnerabilities are often its deepest sources of identity.
pirouette_definition: |
  A method of dissonant injection wherein a manipulator crafts a signal specifically to resonate with a pre-existing structural vulnerability (a Wound Channel, `CORE-011`) in a target's coherence manifold. By targeting a past trauma, insecurity, or cognitive bias, the attack bypasses general defenses and creates a path of least resistance for inducing Turbulent Flow and subsequent Coherence Capture.

          1. Establish a baseline coherence manifold map of the target using resonant probes (`DYNA-002`).
          2. Introduce a spectrum of low-amplitude dissonant signals keyed to common archetypal traumas or known biographical data.
          3. Monitor for localized, asymmetric drops in coherence (Kτ) or disproportionate emotional-cognitive responses.
          4. The signal frequency that produces the maximum response with minimum input identifies a primary Wound Channel.

    excerpt: |
      **Parasitic Channeling:** As the target repeatedly follows the false geodesic, they begin to carve a new, *parasitic Wound Channel* in their own manifold. This channel does not reflect their authentic being; it is a deeply ingrained habit of thought or behavior that perpetually makes the manipulator's desired outcome the path of least resistance, rendering the manipulation self-sustaining.

      justification: |
        Wound Channel Exploitation is the active, malicious triggering of a known cognitive bias or heuristic. The bias represents the "pre-existing geometric weakness" in the cognitive manifold, which allows a carefully crafted argument (dissonant signal) to bypass rational processing.

        The attack vector is analogous to mechanical resonance. The manipulator applies a low-energy, periodic forcing function (the signal) at or near the natural frequency (the insecurity/trauma) of a specific mode of the target system, causing a disproportionately large amplitude response (coherence collapse).

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from general `DISSONANT_INJECTION`. Exploitation is a specific *tactic* of injection that requires prior knowledge or inference of the target's vulnerabilities, making it more efficient and insidious. It is also distinct from `PARASITIC_CHANNELING`, which is the *result* of successful and repeated exploitation.

# Wound Channel Exploitation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A method of dissonant injection wherein a manipulator crafts a signal specifically to resonate with a pre-existing structural vulnerability (a Wound Channel, `CORE-011`) in a target's coherence manifold. By targeting a past trauma, insecurity, or cognitive bias, the attack bypasses general defenses and creates a path of least resistance for inducing Turbulent Flow and subsequent Coherence Capture.

## EFT-First Summary
No adopted EFT mapping currently exists. Conceptually, it represents a targeted perturbation of a system's action (`S = ∫ L dt`) by introducing a potential (`V_manip`) that has high affinity with a pre-existing system instability, maximizing the perturbation's effect for a given energy input. This is analogous to driving a system at its resonant frequency to induce a catastrophic failure.
