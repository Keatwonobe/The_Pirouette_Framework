        The old framework's rigid grid is replaced by the Coherence Compass, a dynamic manifold upon which a system's health plays out. The system's state is located within this four-quadrant space defined by the interplay between two core parameters derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`):

    A physician's ear, pressed against the heart of a system, listening for the rhythm of its health. It does not provide the map for the journey ahead; it reveals, with profound clarity, where the traveler is standing right now.
  law: |
    A system's qualitative state (Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant) is determined by its position (KœÑ, VŒì) on the two-dimensional manifold. A positive Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = KœÑ - VŒì > 0) correlates with Laminar flow, while a non-positive Lagrangian (ùìõ_p ‚â§ 0) correlates with Turbulent or Stagnant flow.
  philosophy: |
    To move beyond mere classification to diagnosis. The Coherence Compass transforms quantitative metrics into a qualitative understanding of a system's health, framing the Weaver not as an analyst but as a systemic physician capable of providing aid.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence Compass is a two-dimensional diagnostic manifold that visualizes a system's state by plotting its internal Temporal Coherence (KœÑ) on the vertical axis against the external Temporal Pressure (VŒì) on the horizontal axis. The resulting four quadrants define the system's primary Flow Dynamics: Laminar Flow (high KœÑ), Turbulent Flow (low KœÑ, high VŒì), and Stagnant Flow (low KœÑ, low VŒì). The system's trajectory across this manifold reveals its health, resilience, and response to its environment.

          1. **Signal Extraction:** Derive KœÑ and VŒì proxy signals from a domain-specific time-series (e.g., KœÑ from signal-to-noise, VŒì from market volatility).
          2. **Plotting:** Over a defined window, trace the system's (KœÑ, VŒì) coordinate trajectory through the Compass quadrants.
          3. **Diagnosis:** Apply quadrant logic to the trajectory's position, variance, and direction to generate a qualitative report (e.g., "Laminar Flow, State of Resilience").

      This diagnostic engine is a practical instrument for empirically measuring a system's adherence to the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = KœÑ - VŒì). A system's position on the Coherence Compass reveals the state of its Lagrangian... Laminar Flow: high, positive ùìõ_p. Turbulent Flow: ùìõ_p is low or negative. Stagnant Flow: Both KœÑ and VŒì are low, resulting in an ùìõ_p near zero.

        The Coherence Compass functions as a phase portrait where the system's state is a point and its evolution is a trajectory. The axes (KœÑ, VŒì) are state variables, and the quadrants (Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant) represent regions with distinct dynamic behaviors, akin to basins of attraction.

# Coherence Compass

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Coherence Compass is a two-dimensional diagnostic manifold that visualizes a system's state by plotting its internal Temporal Coherence (KœÑ) on the vertical axis against the external Temporal Pressure (VŒì) on the horizontal axis. The resulting four quadrants define the system's primary Flow Dynamics: Laminar Flow (high KœÑ), Turbulent Flow (low KœÑ, high VŒì), and Stagnant Flow (low KœÑ, low VŒì). The system's trajectory across this manifold reveals its health, resilience, and response to its environment.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Compass is best understood as a **Phase Portrait** from the study of dynamical systems. It maps the state of a system onto a two-dimensional space defined by its internal order (Temporal Coherence, KœÑ) and external environmental stress (Temporal Pressure, VŒì). The evolution of the system over time is traced as a trajectory on this plane. The quadrants of the Compass correspond to distinct behavioral regimes (Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant), analogous to basins of attraction or regions with different stability properties in a formal phase portrait analysis.
