        Modernizes Entropy-Based Filtering into a time-first protocol for isolating coherent signals from dissonant noise. This module reframes the act as a selective perception of flow states (laminar vs. turbulent), grounded in the physics of information (CORE-013) and the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

    The Weaver does not seek to drain the ocean of noise; they learn to build a net that catches only the faint, clear ringing of coherent bells.
  law: |
    The Coherence Sieve isolates signals by partitioning a data stream into segments and selectively retaining those whose local Temporal Pressure (Γ), or a proxy thereof, falls within a defined threshold corresponding to a targeted flow state (laminar or turbulent).
  philosophy: |
    The Sieve is not a tool for removing what is unwanted; it is an instrument for creating the quiet space where a desired melody can be heard. It is the first and most fundamental act of making sense.
pirouette_definition: |
  A protocol for isolating coherent signals from dissonant noise by reframing the act of filtering as a selective perception of information flow states. The Sieve operates by segmenting a data stream, quantifying the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) of each segment, and then applying a specific pass filter (Laminar, Turbulent, Resonance Band, or Dissonance Notch) to retain only those segments corresponding to the desired state of coherence or turbulence.

        outline: |
          1. **Segmentation:** Divide the input data stream into discrete time-windows.
          2. **Quantification:** For each segment, calculate a proxy for local Temporal Pressure (Γ), typically Shannon Entropy.
          3. **Sieving:** Apply a threshold-based filter (`FilterType`) to the calculated Γ values.
          4. **Output:** Concatenate the retained segments into a new, filtered data stream.
        expected_signals: [A time-series with either uniformly low Γ (Laminar Pass) or uniformly high Γ (Turbulent Pass).]
        pitfalls: [Choosing an incorrect segment size, which can either average out turbulence or introduce spurious noise. Using a Γ-proxy poorly suited to the data modality.]

  - module: DOMA-129
    excerpt: |
      The old framework treated entropy as a statistical property to be filtered. This module reframes that act into a fundamental practice of perception. The Coherence Sieve is not a mere data-cleaning tool; it is an instrument for tuning into the universe's broadcast, allowing a Weaver to isolate the clear, resonant signals of coherent systems from the ever-present, chaotic static of the Temporal Forge.
  - module: DOMA-129
    excerpt: |
      By applying the Sieve, a Weaver is not just cleaning data; they are performing a geological survey of the coherence manifold, identifying the serene valleys and the violent, volcanic peaks that systems must navigate. A **Laminar Pass** selects for "coherence sanctuaries"—regions where systems successfully maximize their Lagrangian. A **Turbulent Pass** selects for "temporal forges"—regions of extreme temporal pressure.

      justification: |
        The Laminar Pass is analogous to an RG flow to the infrared (IR), integrating out high-energy (turbulent) modes to reveal a stable, low-energy effective theory. The Turbulent Pass is analogous to examining the high-energy modes being removed.

      domain: Information Theory
      rationale: |
        This is the most direct operational mapping. The Sieve applies filters to a signal's local entropy spectrum. A `LaminarPass` is a low-pass filter on entropy, retaining low-Γ segments. A `TurbulentPass` is a high-pass filter. A `ResonanceBand` is a band-pass filter. The standard proxy for Γ, Shannon Entropy, solidifies this connection.
      confidence: 0.95

  claims:
    - statement: "Applying a Laminar Pass (low-Γ filter) to a mixed signal reliably increases its signal-to-noise ratio, where 'noise' is defined as high-variance, unpredictable components."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "Demonstration of a system where applying a Laminar Pass systematically removes the meaningful signal and retains what is operationally defined as noise, suggesting the Γ-proxy is uncorrelated with signal coherence in that domain."

  disambiguation: |
    The "Coherence Sieve" is a protocol, not a physical object. It differs from generic "filtering" by its explicit reframing of the task: it does not simply remove "noise," but rather selectively perceives and isolates distinct information flow states (laminar vs. turbulent) based on the principles of the Pirouette Lagrangian.

# Coherence Sieve

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A protocol for isolating coherent signals from dissonant noise by reframing the act of filtering as a selective perception of information flow states. The Sieve operates by segmenting a data stream, quantifying the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) of each segment, and then applying a specific pass filter (Laminar, Turbulent, Resonance Band, or Dissonance Notch) to retain only those segments corresponding to the desired state of coherence or turbulence.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Sieve is an information-theoretic protocol analogous to signal filtering (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass) applied to the entropy spectrum of a time-series data stream. It uses a local entropy metric (e.g., Shannon entropy) as a proxy for Temporal Pressure (Γ) to selectively isolate low-entropy (laminar, coherent) or high-entropy (turbulent, noisy) segments of the stream. This directly corresponds to isolating predictable, low-variance dynamics from chaotic, high-variance ones.
