  art: |
    Time is not a passive river but a taut string; to pluck it is to create a particle, its note the measure of its mass. The universe's inertia is the hum of temporal tension.
  law: |
    The rest mass of any fundamental excitation is directly proportional to the equilibrium coherence density Œì‚ÇÄ, with the proportionality constant fixed by the particle's specific coupling to the Œì-field (e.g., gauge coupling g_N, torsion coupling y_Œì, or self-interaction Œª_Œì).
  philosophy: |
    Temporal Elasticity reframes mass not as an intrinsic property of particles, nor as a gift from an external field, but as an emergent, relational property arising from an excitation's interaction with the dynamic structure of time itself. It geometrizes the origin of inertia, unifying it with the framework's other geometric principles.
pirouette_definition: |
  Temporal Elasticity is the property of the Pirouette substrate that quantifies its resistance to local deformations along the temporal (œÑ) direction. Characterized by the kinetic stiffness coefficient K_Œì in the Œì-sector Lagrangian, this elasticity generates an effective potential for temporal fluctuations. When coupled to matter (Ki-moduli) and gauge fields, the non-zero equilibrium value of the Œì-field, Œì‚ÇÄ, spontaneously breaks symmetries and endows these excitations with rest mass proportional to Œì‚ÇÄ.

          Measure the masses of stable or long-lived particles (e.g., W boson, electron) with extreme precision in environments with varying ambient coherence, approximated by thermodynamic temperature. According to XAP-006C ¬ß10, Œì‚ÇÄ may have a slight dependence on ambient conditions. A plot of particle mass versus temperature would reveal predicted deviations from Standard Model expectations.

  disambiguation: |
    Temporal Elasticity refers to the substrate's dynamic resistance (K_Œì) to *changes* in the Œì-field over time. It should not be confused with the static value of the field (Œì‚ÇÄ) itself, though the two are related via the Lagrangian. The distinction is analogous to that between a spring's stiffness constant and its equilibrium length.

# Temporal Elasticity

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Temporal Elasticity is the property of the Pirouette substrate that quantifies its resistance to local deformations along the temporal (œÑ) direction. Characterized by the kinetic stiffness coefficient K_Œì in the Œì-sector Lagrangian, this elasticity generates an effective potential for temporal fluctuations. When coupled to matter (Ki-moduli) and gauge fields, the non-zero equilibrium value of the Œì-field, Œì‚ÇÄ, spontaneously breaks symmetries and endows these excitations with rest mass proportional to Œì‚ÇÄ.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of effective field theory, Temporal Elasticity provides a geometric origin for the Standard Model Higgs mechanism. The Œì-field's equilibrium value Œì‚ÇÄ acts as the Higgs vacuum expectation value ($v \approx 250$ GeV), breaking electroweak symmetry. Fluctuations of the associated Ki modulus manifest as a 125 GeV scalar boson, while gauge bosons and fermions acquire mass through their respective couplings to Œì‚ÇÄ, mirroring the Standard Model's structure but deriving all mass-scales from a single property of the underlying time-substrate.
