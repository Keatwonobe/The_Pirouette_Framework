  art: |
    The perfect vacuum of spacetime is an illusion; at high energies, a gravitational wave feels the fine-grained, crystalline structure of the underlying temporal medium, causing it to stumble and lose its perfect timing.
  law: |
    Gravitational waves propagating through the temporal medium exhibit a frequency-dependent dispersion relation, ω² = k²[1 + ζ(k/ω_c)² + ...], where ω_c is the barrier scale. This leads to a measurable dephasing of broadband signals relative to the predictions of General Relativity.
  philosophy: |
    Barrier corrections are the primary experimental window into the substrate's microphysics. They reveal that GR is an emergent, low-energy effective theory, and that spacetime itself has a cutoff scale and internal structure.
pirouette_definition: |
  Higher-derivative terms in the gravitational action, suppressed by powers of the barrier scale (ω_c), which arise from the discrete or granular structure of the underlying temporal medium (SUBST-001). At leading order in the transverse-traceless (TT) sector, they manifest as a quartic momentum-dependent correction to the dispersion relation, modifying the propagation speed of gravitons without introducing new polarizations.
operational_definition:
  units: The correction term ζ(k/ω_c)² is dimensionless.

          Analyze the arrival times of a broadband gravitational wave signal (e.g., from a binary merger) across a wide frequency spectrum. Fit the waveform phase evolution to a model including a term proportional to (frequency)². A non-zero coefficient for this term constrains the ratio ζ/ω_c².

    excerpt: |
      At quadratic order the GW sector is luminal and dispersionless in the IR; barrier effects enter at O((ω/ω_c)^2). [...] Barrier (substrate) corrections enter as ΔL_2 = (1/8ω_c^2) [ c_1 (∂^2 h)^2 + … ], leading to a tiny dispersion ω^2 = k^2 [ 1 + ζ (k/ω_c)^2 + O((k/ω_c)^4) ], with ζ = O(1) fixed by the response kernel of the medium.

      Γ-structure (lighthouse): a slowly varying Γ-profile modifies the local stiffness and induces a phase shift Δφ_GW ≈ κ (ω/ω_c)^2 ∫_path dr [∂_r Γ(r)]^2... Observables: frequency-dependent dephasing without new polarizations; handedness-agnostic (affects both +, × equally at leading order).

      justification: |
        The (ω/ω_c)² term is a textbook example of a higher-derivative correction in an Effective Field Theory, representing the leading-order effect of integrating out new physics at the cutoff scale ω_c. Such terms are common in theories of quantum gravity and modified gravity, often leading to Lorentz violation. The Pirouette formalism fixes the leading power n=2.

  disambiguation: |
    "Barrier corrections" specifically refer to effects from the substrate cutoff scale ω_c. They should not be confused with standard GR non-linearities (self-interactions) or environmental effects like plasma dispersion. The term "barrier" evokes a fundamental energy scale beyond which the smooth spacetime description breaks down.
