    A particle's entire history, a single shimmering thread woven through spacetime, encodes the quantum foam of its interactions. The sum over all possible threads reveals its true nature.

    Any valid worldline calculation of a QED loop amplitude must reproduce the results of the corresponding Feynman diagrammatic expansion. For the electron anomalous magnetic moment, the two-loop worldline calculation must yield the coefficient C₂ ≈ +0.328478965...
  philosophy: |
    This formalism shifts the quantum computational basis from summing over virtual particle exchanges (second quantization) to summing over the possible spacetime paths of a single particle (first quantization). It trades the complexity of diagram topologies for the complexity of path integration, often providing a more direct route to gauge-invariant results.
pirouette_definition: |
  A first-quantized approach to calculating quantum field theory loop corrections, particularly in QED. The formalism represents a fermion loop as a path integral over the particle's possible spacetime trajectories (worldlines), parameterized by its proper time (T). Interactions with gauge fields are incorporated as couplings along this worldline, and spin is handled by auxiliary Grassmann variables (ψ). It serves as a powerful alternative and cross-check to traditional Feynman diagram calculations.

        outline: |
          1. Write the one-loop effective action as a worldline path integral over trajectories x(τ) and spin variables ψ(τ).
          2. Introduce an internal photon propagator on the worldline, coupling two points x(τ₁) and x(τ₂) on the same loop. This represents the two-loop vacuum polarization class of corrections.
          3. Integrate out the path x(τ) and the spin variables ψ(τ), which are Gaussian and Grassmann integrals respectively, leaving a parameter integral over proper times and vertex positions.
          4. Apply proper-time renormalization to regulate and subtract divergences.
          5. Extract the coefficient of the desired operator (e.g., the Pauli term σ^μν F_μν) in the q² → 0 limit.
          6. Numerically evaluate the resulting multi-dimensional parameter integral to obtain the final coefficient, e.g., C₂.

        The Worldline Formalism is the direct application of Feynman's path integral idea to the calculation of the one-loop effective action in quantum field theory. Instead of summing diagrams with virtual particles, it sums over the spacetime paths of a single particle. This technique was pioneered by Feynman and later developed into a systematic calculational tool.

  disambiguation: |
    Do not confuse the Worldline Formalism with second quantization. While it calculates results for a quantum field theory (which is second-quantized), the method itself is first-quantized: it integrates over particle paths, not field configurations. It is a mathematical technique, not a fundamental reformulation of QFT itself.

# Worldline Formalism

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A first-quantized approach to calculating quantum field theory loop corrections, particularly in QED. The formalism represents a fermion loop as a path integral over the particle's possible spacetime trajectories (worldlines), parameterized by its proper time (T). Interactions with gauge fields are incorporated as couplings along this worldline, and spin is handled by auxiliary Grassmann variables (ψ). It serves as a powerful alternative and cross-check to traditional Feynman diagram calculations.

## EFT-First Summary
The Worldline Formalism is a well-established technique in the Standard Model for calculating loop-level contributions to effective actions and scattering amplitudes. It is a direct implementation of Feynman's path integral concept applied to particle loops, providing a powerful alternative to diagrammatic methods. It is particularly useful for calculations in background fields and for deriving certain universal results, like the QED two-loop coefficient for the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (`C₂ ≈ +0.328...`), as it often packages gauge-invariant subsets of diagrams automatically.
