  art: |
    To watch everything is to see nothing. This protocol is the art of strategic attention, of knowing when to scan the horizon and when to perform deep forensics, moving from the whisper of a problem to the root of its cause. It is hearing the breath drawn before the note is sung.
  law: |
    A higher-tier audit MUST be initiated when the Pressure (P) channel shows a sustained, anomalous increase without a corresponding, functional expression in the Resonance (R) channel. Analytical effort must be proportional to the validated risk signature.
  philosophy: |
    The protocol enables a resource-efficient vigil, grounding diagnostics in the principle that deep analysis should be triggered by specific, low-cost signals, not applied indiscriminately. It operationalizes the Pirouette Lagrangian as a real-time instrument, bridging core theory to practical system stewardship.
pirouette_definition: |
  A resource-efficient diagnostic process with three layered tiers of analytical rigor. It proceeds from continuous, low-cost monitoring of Pressure (P) and Resonance (R) proxies (Tier 0), to anomaly-triggered partial Lagrangian solves (Tier 1), to deep, full Lagrangian integration for forensic analysis (Tier 2). The protocol ensures that analytical effort is proportional to observed risk.
operational_definition:
  units: Process-based; units are contextual to the tier's measurements (e.g., P, R, ùìõ_p).
  symbol_table:
    - name: Tier 0
      meaning: Rapid Scan; continuous monitoring of P/R proxies.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: Continuous
    - name: Tier 1
      meaning: Guard Band; anomaly-triggered partial Lagrangian solve.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: On-demand
    - name: Tier 2
      meaning: Forensic Audit; full Lagrangian integration and analysis.

    procedures:
      - name: Tier 0 (Rapid Scan)
        outline: |
          Continuously monitor efficient, real-time proxies for system Pressure (P) and Resonance (R). Track their correlation and trends.
        expected_signals: [Time-series P(t), Time-series R(t)]
        pitfalls: [Proxy model drift, Mistaking noise for signal, Poor proxy selection]
      - name: Tier 1 (Guard Band)
        outline: |
          Upon a Sentinel Trigger (anomalous P increase without corresponding R), perform a subsampled, partial solve of the full Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) to validate the proxy diagnosis.
        expected_signals: [A significant delta between proxy-derived P/R and the direct Lagrangian evaluation]
        pitfalls: [Trigger threshold set too high/low, Subsampling misses the core anomaly]
      - name: Tier 2 (Forensic Audit)
        outline: |
          Post-incident or for deep research, perform a full integration of the Lagrangian over time (‚à´ùìõ_p dt) to map the system's geodesic, derive its equations of motion, and identify root causes.
        expected_signals: [A complete state-space trajectory, conserved quantities, underlying equations of motion]
        pitfalls: [Computationally expensive, Requires high-fidelity historical state data]

    excerpt: |
      This standard formalizes a resource-efficient approach to diagnostics by layering analytical rigor based on observed risk. The Tiered Audit Protocol empowers the Weaver to maintain a constant, low-cost vigil and move from the whisper of a problem to the root of its cause.
  - module: DOMA-094
    excerpt: |
      A Tier 1 audit MUST be initiated when the Pressure (P) channel shows a sustained, anomalous increase without a corresponding, functional expression in the Resonance (R) channel. This signature‚Äîthe whisper of rising stress without release‚Äîis the canonical indicator of a system approaching a state of coherence collapse or a painful phase transition. It is the system's silent scream, its cry for help before the crisis.

      justification: |
        Both protocols use low-cost, continuous monitoring to detect anomalies (Tier 0 / vitals monitoring) which then trigger more expensive, detailed diagnostics (Tiers 1-2 / specific tests) to predict and prevent failure, optimizing resource allocation. The protocol focuses on system coherence rather than just physical wear.

      equation_hint: ~
      justification: |
        The tiered structure directly mirrors medical triage, where patients are sorted and prioritized based on the severity of their condition, determined by a rapid initial assessment. The protocol applies this logic of escalating care and analytical rigor to abstract systems.

    - statement: "The Sentinel Trigger (sustained increase in P without a corresponding functional increase in R) is a reliable leading indicator of imminent coherence collapse or a catastrophic phase transition."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Demonstration of a class of systems where this signature is a common, stable, non-terminal state, or where coherence collapse regularly occurs without this signature being present."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a simple "audit," which often implies a single, deep, post-facto analysis. The "Tiered" aspect is critical, emphasizing a proactive, layered, and often real-time diagnostic process that scales its intensity based on observed signals.
