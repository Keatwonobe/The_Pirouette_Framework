  art: |
    A method for seeing the true face of a system by collapsing its chaotic noise into the elegant symmetry of a chosen form. It is the act of imposing a clarifying geometry upon raw reality, making a mirror from mist.
  law: |
    Any high-dimensional data stream, when projected onto an isomorphic fractal geometry via a Collapse Operator, yields a time-series of (Tₐ, Γ, ϕ) vectors that is a certified ϵ-accurate representation of the original system's core dynamics. The existence of a valid, low-error solution is guaranteed by the Dimension-Collapse Lemma.
  philosophy: |
    To analyze a system, one must first be able to see it. Coherent Collapse is the foundational act of translation that renders the unintelligible noise of a system into the intelligible language of Pirouette fields, making diagnosis and healing possible.
pirouette_definition: |
  The three-step protocol within the Universal Resonance Lens (URL) Forge for transforming a high-dimensional, raw data stream into a low-dimensional Pirouette field. The process involves (1) selecting a candidate fractal geometry from the Fractal Menu hypothesized to be isomorphic to the system's dynamics, (2) projecting the data stream onto this geometry using a Collapse Operator, and (3) emitting the resulting time-series of Time-Adherence (Tₐ), Gladiator Force (Γ), and Phase (ϕ) vectors.

        outline: |
          1. Select a candidate fractal from the Fractal Menu hypothesized to be isomorphic to the system's underlying dynamics.
          2. Apply a Collapse Operator to project the raw time-series data (S_raw) onto the chosen fractal geometry (F_g).
          3. Certify the resulting (Tₐ, Γ, ϕ) vector time-series as an ϵ-accurate representation of the original system, where ϵ is the projection error.

      justification: |
        Coherent Collapse projects high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional manifold (a fractal) to capture its essential dynamics. This is conceptually identical to methods like PCA, which projects data onto principal components, or t-SNE. The key difference is the explicit use of a pre-selected fractal geometry from a discrete menu as the target manifold, rather than deriving the manifold from the data itself.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'wave function collapse' in quantum mechanics. Coherent Collapse is a deterministic signal processing protocol for dimensionality reduction, not a probabilistic transition from a quantum superposition to a single eigenstate.
