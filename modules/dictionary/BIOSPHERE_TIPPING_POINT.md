    The green line on the chart, representing the world's health, ceases its gentle decline and breaks downward. It is the sound of a planetary fever breaking not into health, but into seizure. The moment the stage upon which the drama unfolds begins to actively collapse, dragging the actors down with it.
  law: |
    A discrete event is triggered within a simulation when the Time-Adherence ($T_a$) of the `Biosphere` actor falls below a critical threshold (1.0 in PDM-003). Once triggered, this event initiates a persistent, non-linear cascade of negative feedback on the Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) and Time-Adherence ($T_a$) of all other actors.
  philosophy: |
    This event mechanizes the principle that gradual degradation can lead to sudden, irreversible state changes. It serves as a formal warning that the background context of a system is not inert; its collapse fundamentally alters the rules and possibilities for every participant. It represents the point where the environment stops being a resource and becomes an active antagonist.
pirouette_definition: |
  A key shock event logged by the PirouetteEngine, defined in the Grand Simulation (PDM-003), that marks the onset of irreversible, cascading collapse of the planetary life-support system. The event is triggered when the `Biosphere` actor's Time-Adherence ($T_a$) drops below a pre-defined stability threshold. Post-trigger, the event imposes severe and persistent negative feedback on all other simulated actors, reflecting the systemic dismantling of civilization by environmental failure.

        outline: |
          Execute a PirouetteEngine simulation incorporating a `Biosphere` actor. At each time step, query the `Biosphere.Ta` value. Log a `BIOSPHERE_TIPPING_POINT` event in the simulation's `event_log` the first time the value crosses below the defined threshold (e.g., 1.0).
        expected_signals: [A discrete entry in the simulation's event log, A subsequent, sustained decline in the `Ta` and `Gamma` of other actors due to the `feedback_damage` term.]
        pitfalls: [Miscalibration of the trigger threshold, leading to premature or delayed event logging., Failing to model the cumulative damage from other actors that drives `Biosphere.Ta` towards the threshold.]

    excerpt: |
      The Biosphere Tipping Point (~2038): This is the first and most important shock. The planet's climate and life-support systems cross a threshold and begin to collapse in a non-linear cascade. This marks the moment the crisis becomes irreversible and begins to actively dismantle civilization.

      justification: |
        The term is a direct analogue to the concept of tipping points in climate and ecological science, where a system is pushed across a critical threshold into a new, often degraded, stable state. The Pirouette implementation models this as a specific threshold (`Biosphere.Ta < 1.0`) that activates a new set of system dynamics (cascading feedback damage).

  claims:
    - statement: "Once triggered, the Biosphere Tipping Point introduces a persistent `feedback_damage` term that negatively affects the `Ta` and `Gamma` of all other major actors in the PDM-003 simulation."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "An execution of the PDM-003 simulation where the event triggers but the `feedback_damage` term is not applied, or is applied only transiently, failing to cause a sustained decline in other actors' core metrics."

  disambiguation: |
    This term refers to the discrete, logged *event* of crossing the threshold, not the gradual decline in the Biosphere's health (`Biosphere.Ta`) that precedes it. The Tipping Point is the moment of state change from reversible degradation to irreversible, cascading collapse.
