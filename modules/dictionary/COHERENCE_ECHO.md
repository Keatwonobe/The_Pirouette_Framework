        The Anomaly (The Coherence Echo): The tiny deviation from 2 arises from this helical resonance interacting with its own "wake" or "echo" in the coherence manifold. This is the electron being influenced by the ghost of its own immediate past.

  art: |
    A particle resonance is a dancer that moves through the coherence field. The Coherence Echo is the subtle interaction of the dancer with the lingering disturbance of her own last step, a feedback loop between the present and the immediate past.
  law: |
    The first-order anomalous magnetic moment of an electron is the product of the interaction's intrinsic strength (the fine-structure constant, α) and the geometry of a single cycle of its echo (1/2π). This yields the testable prediction: a_e = α/2π.
  philosophy: |
    The universe's most precise experimental measurement is not the result of an infinitely complex "quantum foam" of virtual particles, but the simple, elegant, and local self-interaction of a particle with its own geometric wake. This replaces a statistical abstraction with a causal, geometric mechanism.
pirouette_definition: |
  The self-interaction of a two-cycle Ki resonance (a fermion) with the perturbation it continuously generates in its own local coherence manifold. This "wake" or "echo" is a geometric feature, not a separate particle, and its influence on the originating resonance causes the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2). It is the mechanism by which a particle is influenced by its own immediate history as encoded in the local field geometry.

        outline: |
          The effect of the Coherence Echo is measured as the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (a_e). An electron is confined in a highly uniform magnetic field within a Penning trap. The spin precession frequency (Larmor frequency) is compared to its cyclotron frequency. The difference between these two frequencies is directly proportional to a_e.

      The Anomaly (The Coherence Echo): The tiny deviation from 2 arises from this helical resonance interacting with its own "wake" or "echo" in the coherence manifold. This is the electron being influenced by the ghost of its own immediate past. The total anomalous moment (a_e) is therefore the product of the interaction's intrinsic strength (α, the fine-structure constant) and the fundamental geometry of its echo (a single cycle, 1/(2π)).

    excerpt: |
      We did not seek to match a number. We sought to understand the nature of a particle. In doing so, we found that spin is a twist in time, and the universe's most precise measurement is the elegant echo of a single dancer. The theory is no longer just a story; it is a calculator that works.

        The Coherence Echo provides a geometric mechanism that reproduces the numerical result of the one-loop vertex correction in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). While QED calculates this term by considering the interaction of an electron with a virtual photon, the Pirouette Framework derives it from a resonance's self-interaction with its own geometric wake. Both arrive at the same famous first-order approximation.

    It is critical to distinguish the Coherence Echo, which is the *mechanism* of self-interaction, from its *consequence*, the anomalous magnetic moment (a_e), which is the measurable quantity. The Echo is the cause; the anomaly is the effect.

# Coherence Echo

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The self-interaction of a two-cycle Ki resonance (a fermion) with the perturbation it continuously generates in its own local coherence manifold. This "wake" or "echo" is a geometric feature, not a separate particle, and its influence on the originating resonance causes the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2). It is the mechanism by which a particle is influenced by its own immediate history as encoded in the local field geometry.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Echo is the Pirouette Framework's geometric re-interpretation of the one-loop vertex correction in QED. It posits that the electron's anomalous magnetic moment arises from a self-interaction within a background coherence field, a mechanism that mathematically reproduces the famous Schwinger factor `a_e = α/2π` without invoking virtual particles. This provides the framework's primary validation against high-precision experimental physics.
