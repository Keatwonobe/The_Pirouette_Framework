  art: |
    The cosmic blueprint for transformation, where the universe's memory of its own structure is encoded. Its spiral term is the tether between stillness and motion, a tension that resolves in the discrete 'snap' of change.
  law: |
    The total action of a system includes a term ℒ_spiral, proportional to the Ki constant, which couples the field strength tensor F_μν to the curl of the vector potential A_β. This term mandates a quantized difference (ΔKi ≈ 0.0472) between the coherence topologies of rest (π+1) and relativistic motion (4π/3).
  philosophy: |
    To unify the continuous evolution described by field theory with the discrete, quantized 'ticks' of physical change. The Spiral-Extended Lagrangian asserts that the very geometry of spacetime contains a topological charge (Ki) that governs the rhythm of all transformations, from chemical reactions to inertial leaps.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Spiral-Extended Lagrangian (ℒ_spiral) is a modification to the standard electromagnetic Lagrangian that introduces a topological term proportional to the Ki constant. This term, `(K_i / λ_*) ε^μναβ F_μν ∂_α A_β`, quantifies the rate of phase evolution and coherence across spacetime fields. It provides the mathematical origin for the dual-valued Ki constant (Ki_rest and Ki_motion) and the tether-snap dynamics that govern discrete state transitions.

        outline: |
          Measure the centroid position of interference fringes for a particle source in two states: (1) at rest in the lab frame, and (2) in a co-moving frame (e.g., accelerated). The Spiral-Extended Lagrangian predicts a small, systematic shift in the centroid position proportional to ΔKi = Ki_motion - Ki_rest.

      The mathematical law, \(K_i^{\text{motion}}/K_i^{\text{rest}} = 1+1/(3π)\), and the dynamic law for the energy barrier, \(E_{snap} = \tfrac12 m(\Delta v)^2\), together anchor Ki both numerically and dynamically. The Spiral-Extended Lagrangian is the common origin for these laws, linking the geometry of the topological term to the energy required for a state transition.

        ℒ_spiral adds a term of the form `k * ε^μναβ F_μν ∂_α A_β`, which is a gauge-variant topological term related to the Chern-Simons form.
      justification: |
        The spiral term has the same topological structure (ε tensor contracting fields) as Chern-Simons-like terms in 3+1D, which modify Maxwell's equations. Both terms break parity (P) symmetry. The Pirouette term directly links phase evolution (via Ki) to the field, analogous to how Chern-Simons terms can induce topological effects or modify particle spectra.

    Distinguish from the standard Maxwell Lagrangian, −¼ F_μν F^μν, to which this is an additive term. Also, differentiate from the Chern-Pontryagin density (∝ F ∧ F), as the spiral term involves the vector potential directly (∝ F ∧ dA), making it gauge-variant without specific boundary conditions.

# Spiral-Extended Lagrangian

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Spiral-Extended Lagrangian (ℒ_spiral) is a modification to the standard electromagnetic Lagrangian that introduces a topological term proportional to the Ki constant. This term, `(K_i / λ_*) ε^μναβ F_μν ∂_α A_β`, quantifies the rate of phase evolution and coherence across spacetime fields. It provides the mathematical origin for the dual-valued Ki constant (Ki_rest and Ki_motion) and the tether-snap dynamics that govern discrete state transitions.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of Effective Field Theory (EFT), the Spiral-Extended Lagrangian introduces a Chern-Simons-like topological term `(K_i / λ_*) ε^μναβ F_μν ∂_α A_β` to standard electrodynamics. This term breaks parity and induces a "topological charge" governed by the dimensionless constant Ki. Its presence would manifest as subtle, velocity-dependent modifications to light propagation and quantized energy barriers in state transitions, linking low-energy phenomenology to high-energy topological structure.
