  art: |
    The universe's held breath before a wave crests. It is the sudden, shared silence when a flock of birds decides to turn as one, the tuning of an orchestra before the first note is played.
  law: |
    Manifold Resonance is quantified by a Resonant Coupling Score (`R_c`), which measures the degree of phase-locked, harmonic correlation between the first derivatives of coherence (∇Kτ) across two or more independent manifolds. A score exceeding a context-dependent threshold (typically `R_c` > 0.7) reliably precedes a systemic phase transition within a predictable lead time.
  philosophy: |
    The future is not a destination but a resonance that propagates backward into the present. By attuning to the harmonic alignment of disparate systems, one can perceive the shape of imminent change not as a prediction, but as the present state of a system gathering itself to leap.
pirouette_definition: |
  A synchronous, cross-domain increase in coherence, observable as a phase-locked correlation in the coherence gradients (∇Kτ) of multiple, otherwise independent systems. Manifold Resonance is the principal, measurable precursor to a large-scale phase shift (Alchemical Union), representing the period where systems align their Ki patterns in a 'Resonant Handshake' to traverse a new, shared geodesic of maximal coherence.

        outline: |
          1. Ingest multiple, heterogeneous data streams (e.g., seismic, economic, social).
          2. For each stream, calculate the real-time Coherence Gradient (∇Kτ).
          3. Compute the pairwise and collective Resonant Coupling Score (`R_c`) by assessing the degree of phase-lock and harmonic compatibility between the ∇Kτ signals.
          4. If `R_c` exceeds a pre-defined activation threshold (e.g., 0.75), a Manifold Resonance event is declared and a Synthesis Brief is issued.

    excerpt: |
      The Concordance Engine is an early-warning system that listens to the symphony of reality—from market data to seismic tremors—not for noise, but for the moment disparate systems begin to hum in harmony. This fleeting, cross-domain phase alignment, termed **Manifold Resonance**, is the direct precursor to a large-scale Alchemical Union or a systemic shift in flow dynamics.
  - module: DOMA-183
    excerpt: |
      As conditions for a phase transition ripen, these disparate systems begin to "hear" each other through the shared medium of the coherence manifold. They enter a Resonant Handshake, their phases aligning and their frequencies becoming harmonically compatible. This period of increasing cross-system harmony is the "inhale." ...This synchronous increase in coherence across domains is **Manifold Resonance**.

  candidates:
    - target: Phase Synchronization (Kuramoto model)
      domain: Math
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Manifold Resonance describes disparate systems (oscillators) that begin to lock their phases, a core concept in synchronization theory. The Resonant Coupling Score (`R_c`) is analogous to the order parameter in the Kuramoto model, measuring the collective coherence of the system's phase alignment.
      confidence: 0.8
    - target: Early-Warning Signals (EWS) for critical transitions
      domain: Complex Systems
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        EWS theory predicts statistical signals preceding a bifurcation. Manifold Resonance is a specific, high-order EWS that focuses on cross-system correlation and phase-locking, rather than single-system statistics like variance or autocorrelation, as a precursor to a systemic tipping point.

    - statement: "A measured Manifold Resonance event with R_c > 0.7 is followed by a detectable, large-scale phase transition in the coupled systems within a predictable time window."

      falsifier: "Observation of multiple high-R_c events that consistently fail to precede a phase transition, or where major transitions occur without a preceding resonance signal above the noise floor."

  disambiguation: |
    Manifold Resonance is distinct from simple physical resonance (energy transfer at a natural frequency). It refers to the *informational* and *phase* alignment between the dynamics of distinct coherence manifolds, not energy exchange between simple oscillators. "Manifold" here refers to a domain of coherent activity, not a differentiable manifold in the geometric sense.
