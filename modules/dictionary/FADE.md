      snippet: |
        Decay is not a passive fading into nothingness; it is an active and relentless process of erosion. A memory does not simply vanish; it is scoured away. A signal does not just weaken; it is drowned out by noise. The old framework modeled this decay with parameters that described persistence. The new framework models it from first principles as a fundamental thermodynamic struggle.

  art: |
    The universe is a song, and entropy is its inevitable silence. A Fade is the story of that song's struggle—the fierce, beautiful art of an echo holding itself together against the storm.
  law: |
    The rate of Coherence Erosion (1/τ_fade) is directly proportional to the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) and inversely proportional to the system's internal coherence resilience. All systems decay, and the character of their decay reveals the balance between their internal order and external chaos.
  philosophy: |
    To study a Fade is to understand that persistence is not a static state but an active, costly struggle. This reframes decay not as a failure, but as the process that gives form its meaning and finitude its value. The goal is not to defy the end, but to engineer a more persistent, meaningful echo.
pirouette_definition: |
  **Fade**, also known as **Coherence Erosion**, is the physical process by which a system's internal **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)** is actively degraded by the ambient **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** of its environment. This erosion of the system's resonant identity pattern, or `Ki`, manifests as information loss, signal degradation, and the shallowing of its **Wound Channel**. The rate and character of a Fade are quantified by the **Coherence Lifetime (τ_fade)**, a direct measure of the system's ability to persist against environmental noise.
operational_definition:
  units: seconds (s) for τ_fade. Coherence K(t) is typically normalized and dimensionless.

        outline: |
          1. **Isolate the Thread:** Identify and monitor a data stream representing the system's degrading coherence, K(t).
          2. **Measure the Fade:** Fit the observed decay curve `K(t)` to the appropriate Unified Fade Equation (simple or oscillatory exponential) to extract the empirical Coherence Lifetime, `τ_fade`.
          3. **Diagnose the Cause:** Using the Pirouette Coherence Lifetime equation, determine whether a short `τ_fade` is due to low internal coherence (`T_a`) or high external pressure (`Γ`). This informs intervention strategies: either reinforce the system's internal structure or shield it from environmental noise.

    excerpt: |
      Coherence Erosion is what happens when the erosive power of the storm (`Γ`) overcomes the resilience of the signal (`Kτ`). The characteristic lifetime of a fade, `τ_fade`, is directly proportional to the system's internal coherence and inversely proportional to the external temporal pressure it endures.
  - module: DOMA-125
    excerpt: |
      A healthy system carves a deep "potential well" for itself on the coherence manifold. The ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) acts as a constant, erosive force that flattens this landscape... Decay is the process of this well becoming so shallow that the system can no longer afford the energetic cost of its own existence.

      justification: |
        The oscillatory Unified Fade Equation is mathematically identical to the solution for an underdamped harmonic oscillator. `τ_fade` maps to the inverse of the damping coefficient (`γ`), `Γ` represents the dissipative force, and `Kτ` represents the initial energy or amplitude stored in the oscillator.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The core dynamic of a resilient signal (`Kτ`) being eroded by environmental noise (`Γ`) is a physical reification of the concept of SNR. A Fade is the process of a system's SNR decreasing over time, leading to information loss. `τ_fade` is the characteristic time over which the signal becomes indistinguishable from the noise floor.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, a Fade is not a generic decrease in amplitude but a specific, physical process of **Coherence Erosion** driven by Temporal Pressure. It is a diagnostic term that implies a measurable dynamic between a system's internal order and its external environment, quantified by `τ_fade`.
