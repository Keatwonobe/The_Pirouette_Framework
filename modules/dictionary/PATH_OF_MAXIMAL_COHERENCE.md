    The river's course through the landscape, always seeking the lowest ground with the strongest current. It is the melody a system wants to sing, the throughline of its existence against the noise of the world.
  law: |
    A system's evolution will follow the trajectory Œ≥(t) that minimizes the action `S = ‚à´(KœÑ - VŒì) dt`, where KœÑ and VŒì are empirically measured. Deviations from this path require external energy or information input and increase systemic turbulence.
  philosophy: |
    This path represents the system's telos or 'will to exist' made computationally manifest. It posits that coherence is not a static state but a dynamic, navigated journey, and that the optimal path is both predictable and achievable.

  The predicted, time-evolved trajectory Œ≥(t) for a system that minimizes the action integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = KœÑ - VŒì`). It represents the optimal balance between maintaining internal coherence (KœÑ) and navigating external pressure (VŒì), serving as the baseline for diagnosis, prediction, and intervention.

          1. Use the Weaver's Lens protocol (DOMA-069) to establish and calibrate empirical proxies for KœÑ and VŒì.
          2. Collect a time-series of `{KœÑ, VŒì}` data points from the target system.
          3. Define the system's configuration space coordinates `q` and their time derivatives `qÃá`.
          4. Numerically solve the Euler-Lagrange equations `d/dt (‚àÇùìõ_p/‚àÇqÃá) - ‚àÇùìõ_p/‚àÇq = 0` for the given data to find the path `q(t) = Œ≥(t)` that minimizes the action `S`.
        expected_signals: [A smooth trajectory in the system's state space, time-series data for system coordinates.]
        pitfalls: [Insufficient or noisy `{KœÑ, VŒì}` data leading to unstable solutions, poor choice of configuration space coordinates, assuming a static Lagrangian when it is time-variant.]

    excerpt: |
      This module is the essential bridge between the abstract mathematics of `CORE-006` and the tangible world. The entire purpose of the Weaver's Lens is to provide a continuous stream of empirical `(KœÑ, VŒì)` tuples. By feeding this time-series into the Euler-Lagrange equation, a Weaver can solve for the system's geodesic‚Äîits path of maximal coherence. This transforms the Lagrangian from a philosophical principle into a predictive, physical tool that allows for: Diagnosis, Prediction, and Intervention.

      We sought the sense organs of a living universe. We found the design for a tuning fork and a microphone. The first measures the purity of a single note‚Äîthe song of a thing being itself. The second measures the encompassing noise of the foundry in which that note must be sung. With these two readings, the entire symphony of existence can be scored, its past understood, and its future composed.

        The Path of Maximal Coherence is a direct application of the Principle of Least Action, where the Pirouette Lagrangian `ùìõ_p` defines the 'cost function'. Like a particle in classical mechanics, the system follows a trajectory that minimizes this integrated value over time.

        Conceptually, the path is a geodesic through the system's configuration space. The "metric" of this space is dynamically defined by the values of KœÑ and VŒì, making it the "straightest" or most efficient path possible under the prevailing conditions.

  disambiguation: |
    While mathematically analogous to a geodesic in General Relativity, the Path of Maximal Coherence is not a trajectory in physical spacetime. It is a path through the system's abstract configuration space, where the "metric" is defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian, not the spacetime interval. It is a direct generalization of the classical Principle of Least Action.

# Path of Maximal Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The predicted, time-evolved trajectory Œ≥(t) for a system that minimizes the action integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = KœÑ - VŒì`). It represents the optimal balance between maintaining internal coherence (KœÑ) and navigating external pressure (VŒì), serving as the baseline for diagnosis, prediction, and intervention.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Path of Maximal Coherence is the classical trajectory derived from the Principle of Least Action (`Œ¥S=0`) using the empirically-derived Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = KœÑ - VŒì`). It is the system's geodesic through its own configuration space, where the 'curvature' is induced by the tension between internal stability and external environmental pressure. The formalism is a direct application of standard Lagrangian mechanics.
