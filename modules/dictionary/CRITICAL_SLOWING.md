        1. **Critical Slowing Hypothesis:** Near awareness collapse, neural recovery time (τ_P) diverges as (Γ → Γ_c).

  art: |
    As a system nears its breaking point, time itself stretches. The return to coherence becomes an infinitely long journey from an infinitesimally small step away. The echo of perturbation lingers indefinitely at the edge of change.
  law: |
    The relaxation time (τ_P) of a perturbed neural triad state diverges with a power-law relationship to the cognitive load control parameter (Γ) as Γ approaches its critical value Γ_c. This divergence is quantitatively linked to the scaling of the coherence correlation length (ξ_P).
  philosophy: |
    Critical slowing reveals that cognitive collapse is not an instantaneous failure but a predictable, measurable phase transition. It connects the dynamics of conscious access to universal principles governing critical phenomena, suggesting that the mind's stability follows the same fundamental laws as physical systems at a tipping point.
pirouette_definition: |
  The phenomenon where the relaxation time (τ_P) required for a system to recover from a perturbation diverges as a control parameter (Γ, e.g., cognitive load) approaches a critical value (Γ_c). Within Pirouette, it is the primary dynamical signature of a second-order phase transition in conscious access, where the collapse of triadic resonance is preceded by an observable and power-law-governed slowdown in recovery kinetics.

        outline: |
          1. Induce a stable phase-locked neural triad (e.g., via tACS).
          2. Gradually increase cognitive load (Γ) while monitoring triad coherence (TPCI).
          3. After the triad decoheres (TPCI collapses), reduce Γ to a sub-critical value.
          4. Measure the time elapsed (τ_P) from the TPCI minimum until it recovers to a threshold (e.g., 90% of its baseline value).
          5. Repeat across multiple trials and load ramp rates to map the τ_P(Γ) curve and identify Γ_c.

        pitfalls: [Participant fatigue confounding recovery times, poor signal-to-noise ratio in TPCI measurement, difficulty in precisely identifying the moment of collapse.]

    excerpt: |
      **Critical Slowing Hypothesis:** Near awareness collapse, neural recovery time (τ_P) diverges as (Γ → Γ_c). This module describes how to empirically measure and model the dynamic scaling of triadic resonance collapse in neural systems, verifying the renormalization flow predictions from [MATH-026].
  - module: COG-RES-002
    excerpt: |
      If τ_P does not diverge near Γ_c, dynamic criticality is falsified. If triad coherence collapses stochastically without critical slowing, the system may not follow LPF dynamics. The expected result is a τ_P vs Γ curve forming a cusp at Γ_c.

      justification: |
        This is the direct analogue of critical slowing down in statistical mechanics, where the relaxation time of order parameter fluctuations diverges at a second-order phase transition. The Pirouette measurement of τ_P diverging as Γ → Γ_c is a direct operational and mathematical mapping of this core concept from the theory of dynamic critical phenomena.

    - statement: "Recovery time (τ_P) from triad decoherence diverges in a power-law fashion as cognitive load (Γ) approaches a critical threshold (Γ_c)."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "τ_P remains bounded, increases linearly, or shows no systematic relationship with Γ near the point of triad collapse."

    - statement: "The dynamic exponent z_P relating recovery time to correlation length (τ_P ∝ ξ_P^z_P) is approximately 2."
      domain: theory|experiment
      falsifier: "Experimental measurement yields a value for z_P that is statistically inconsistent with the Pirouette-predicted universality class (z_P ≈ 2.0 ± 0.3)."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The term "critical slowing" is widely used in ecology, climate science, and finance to describe similar dynamics in complex systems approaching a tipping point.]
  disambiguation: |
    Critical Slowing should be distinguished from generic cognitive slowdown (e.g., increased reaction time) under load. Critical slowing is a specific, non-linear, divergent behavior measured in the recovery dynamics *at* a phase boundary, not a simple linear degradation of performance.
