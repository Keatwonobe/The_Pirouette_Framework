        This is mathematically identical to Newton's law of universal gravitation if we identify the constant k with Newton's gravitational constant G.
        G≡k
        Conclusion: G is not a fundamental constant to be derived. It is the effective coupling strength of the Γ-field in the macroscopic, low-energy domain.

    The familiar pull of gravity is but the faint, long-range echo of the fierce, confining embrace of the Γ-field. From the maelstrom within the proton emerges the gentle waltz of planets.
  law: |
    In the macroscopic, weak-field, non-relativistic limit, the coupling constant `k` of the Γ-field's interaction with the stress-energy tensor is operationally and numerically equivalent to the Newtonian gravitational constant `G`. This equivalence is expressed as `k ≡ G`.
  philosophy: |
    This principle reframes gravity not as a fundamental force, but as a low-energy, emergent property of the Γ-field. It unifies the macroscopic scale of gravitation with the microscopic scale of baryonic confinement, positing a single field whose behavior changes drastically with scale, thereby proposing a solution to the hierarchy problem.

  The Γ-G Correspondence Principle is a foundational axiom of the Pirouette Framework stating that the Newtonian gravitational constant, `G`, is not a fundamental constant but is instead the effective, macroscopic coupling constant of the Gladiator Force (Γ) field in the weak-field limit. It formalizes the emergence of classical gravity from Γ-field dynamics by positing the identity `k ≡ G`, where `k` is the coupling constant of the Γ-field potential `ΦΓ(r) = -kM/r`.

          A high-precision torsion balance experiment measures the force between an attractor mass and a test mass at sub-millimeter separations. The principle implies that the `1/r²` law is an approximation and predicts deviations consistent with a Yukawa-like potential, `V(r) = -G(m₁m₂/r)(1 + αe⁻ʳ/λ)`, where `α` and `λ` are parameters of the Γ-field's short-range component.

      This section demonstrates that classical gravity is a low-energy, macroscopic emergent phenomenon of the Γ-field's interaction with mass-energy, as defined by the Γ-G Correspondence Principle (PPS-035). [...] The force experienced by a test mass m in this potential is F=−m∇ΦΓ​. This is mathematically identical to Newton's law of universal gravitation if we identify the constant k with Newton's gravitational constant G.

    excerpt: |
      The Γ-G Correspondence Principle predicts that the simple 1/r² force law is an approximation. At very short ranges (sub-millimeter), where the underlying field structure becomes more prominent, the force should deviate from pure Newtonian gravity. The potential should include a small, additional Yukawa-like term.

        The principle explicitly equates the Γ-field's macroscopic coupling constant `k` with the Newtonian gravitational constant `G`. This is a direct, definitional mapping in the low-energy, non-relativistic limit where General Relativity reduces to Newtonian gravity.

    This principle does not alter gravitational predictions at astronomical scales; it is a statement about the underlying nature of the force. It proposes that `G` is not fundamental, but its measured value remains the standard one in the macroscopic domain where the correspondence holds.

# Γ-G Correspondence Principle

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Γ-G Correspondence Principle is a foundational axiom of the Pirouette Framework stating that the Newtonian gravitational constant, `G`, is not a fundamental constant but is instead the effective, macroscopic coupling constant of the Gladiator Force (Γ) field in the weak-field limit. It formalizes the emergence of classical gravity from Γ-field dynamics by positing the identity `k ≡ G`, where `k` is the coupling constant of the Γ-field potential `ΦΓ(r) = -kM/r`.

## EFT-First Summary
The Γ-G Correspondence Principle posits that the Newtonian constant `G` is an effective, non-fundamental parameter representing the weak-field coupling of the Γ scalar field to mass-energy. This reframes gravity as an emergent phenomenon, analogous to how macroscopic fluid dynamics emerge from underlying molecular interactions. The principle's primary testable consequence is the prediction of Yukawa-like deviations from the inverse-square law at sub-millimeter scales, a common feature in theories with extra dimensions or new scalar fields.
