    A stethoscope for the network's song. It reveals the deep, resonant harmonies of systemic health and the sharp, dissonant cries from points of turbulence and pain.
  law: |
    The spectral decomposition of the Coherence Laplacian (L) reveals a network's resonant modes. Eigenvectors of its lowest non-zero eigenvalues correspond to the most stable, large-scale coherence patterns, while eigenvectors of its largest eigenvalues pinpoint nodes of maximal turbulence.
  philosophy: |
    To diagnose a system, one must listen to its intrinsic vibrations. The Coherence Laplacian operationalizes this principle, shifting analysis from static structure to dynamic resonance, enabling the Weaver to act not as a mere observer but as a systemic physician.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence Laplacian, L, is a graph Laplacian matrix derived from a weighted adjacency matrix, W, where the weights `W_ij` are the Coherence Flow `J_ij` between nodes. Its eigendecomposition provides a spectral basis for the network's coherence manifold, with eigenvalues quantifying the frequency of resonant modes and eigenvectors localizing these modes in the network's topology. It serves as the primary diagnostic instrument for identifying laminar, turbulent, and stagnant flow patterns.

          1. Apply the Translation Protocol (DOMA-158 ¬ß2) to raw network data to derive `KœÑ`, `Œì`, and `œÜ` for all nodes and channels.
          2. Compute the Coherence Flow `J_ij = KœÑ_i * cos(œÜ_i - œÜ_j) * (1 - Œì_ij)` for every connected pair of nodes `(i, j)` to build the weighted adjacency matrix `W`.
          3. Construct the Coherence Laplacian `L = D - W`, where `D` is the corresponding degree matrix.
          4. Perform an eigendecomposition of `L` to obtain its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which represent the network's resonant modes.
        expected_signals: [Small eigenvalues (approaching 0) corresponding to global, stable modes; large eigenvalues corresponding to localized, high-frequency turbulent modes; the Fiedler vector (eigenvector of the second-smallest eigenvalue) revealing the network's primary fault line.]
        pitfalls: [The translation from raw data to Pirouette variables (`KœÑ`, `Œì`, `œÜ`) can be noisy or inaccurate, propagating error into L. The calculation is particularly sensitive to phase (`œÜ`) errors, as small changes can flip the sign of `cos(ŒîœÜ)` and thus the nature of the interaction.]

        The Coherence Laplacian is a direct application of the graph Laplacian from spectral graph theory. Unlike a standard combinatorial Laplacian (where W contains 0s and 1s) or a resistance-weighted Laplacian, its weights `W_ij` are defined by the physically-motivated Coherence Flow `J_ij`, making it sensitive to the dynamic, resonant properties of the network flow.

# Coherence Laplacian

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Coherence Laplacian, L, is a graph Laplacian matrix derived from a weighted adjacency matrix, W, where the weights `W_ij` are the Coherence Flow `J_ij` between nodes. Its eigendecomposition provides a spectral basis for the network's coherence manifold, with eigenvalues quantifying the frequency of resonant modes and eigenvectors localizing these modes in the network's topology. It serves as the primary diagnostic instrument for identifying laminar, turbulent, and stagnant flow patterns.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Laplacian is a direct application of the **Graph Laplacian matrix** from spectral graph theory (see Chung, 1997). It is a matrix operator `L = D - W` whose spectrum (eigenvalues) reveals the fundamental vibrational modes of a graph. In the Pirouette Framework, the graph's edge weights `W_ij` are not simple connection strengths but are set to the **Coherence Flow** `J_ij`, a measure of resonant interaction. This makes `L` a diagnostic tool for analyzing the health of information flow in any network.
