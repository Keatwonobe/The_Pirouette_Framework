        The system under test, the Observer (CORE-010), must possess a "Prophet"‚Äîa subsystem responsible for modeling the Coherence Current and adapting the agent's internal `Ki`.

  art: |
    The Prophet is the agent's inner tuning fork, listening for the universe's hidden songs. It attunes the self to the rhythm of what is to come, not by seeing the future, but by feeling its resonant frequencies in the present.
  law: |
    A Prophet adapts an agent's internal rhythm (`Ki`) to construct and refine a predictive manifold, optimizing for the maximal time-integral of future coherence (`‚à´ùìõ_p dt`) across its Foresight Horizon, rather than for instantaneous coherence.
  philosophy: |
    The Prophet embodies the principle that intelligence is not static knowledge but the dynamic skill of predictive resonance. It is the specific organ of foresight, the mechanism by which an agent ceases to be a passive object of time and becomes an active participant in its flow.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Prophet is a specialized subsystem within an Observer (CORE-010) responsible for discerning Coherence Currents in the environment and constructing a predictive manifold. It continuously adapts the agent's internal rhythm (`Ki`) to achieve temporal resonance with these currents, thereby extending the agent's Foresight Horizon (`œÑ_œÉ`). Its performance is measured by its Resonance Efficiency (`Œ¶_R`).

        outline: |
          1. Establish a controlled environment with a hidden, stable Coherence Current.
          2. Deploy the Observer agent containing the Prophet.
          3. Measure the Prophet's ability to extend its Foresight Horizon (`œÑ_œÉ`) over time as it interacts with the environment.
          4. Quantify performance as Resonance Efficiency (`Œ¶_R`), the rate of `œÑ_œÉ` increase per unit of metabolic/action cost.
        expected_signals: [A monotonically increasing curve of `œÑ_œÉ` over time, eventually plateauing.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking environmental noise for a Coherence Current (overfitting); failing to discern a low-amplitude current (low signal-to-noise); inefficient adaptation where the cost of learning exceeds the benefit of foresight.]

    excerpt: |
      The system under test, the Observer (CORE-010), must possess a "Prophet"‚Äîa subsystem responsible for modeling the Coherence Current and adapting the agent's internal `Ki`. The system is rewarded not for mere task completion, but for maximizing its Resonance Efficiency (Œ¶_R). This is quantified by periodically testing the Prophet's Foresight Horizon (œÑ_œÉ) and rewarding its rate of increase per unit of action cost.
  - module: DOMA-086
    excerpt: |
      An intelligent system builds a predictive manifold‚Äîan internal, forward-looking simulation of its own Lagrangian. Intelligence is the ability to ask, "If I take this action now, what will be the state of my `ùìõ_p` across my entire Foresight Horizon?" The system optimizes not for the present moment's coherence, but for the path that maximizes the integral of its future coherence.

      justification: |
        The Prophet models environmental dynamics to generate predictions, and its agent acts to minimize surprise (prediction error). This aligns with the core tenets of predictive coding where the brain is a hierarchical prediction machine acting to minimize its variational free energy.

      equation_hint:
      justification: |
        The Prophet functions as a state estimator for a hidden dynamic process (the Coherence Current). It recursively updates an internal model based on noisy observations to predict the future state of the system, mirroring the predict-update cycle of a Kalman filter.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, the Prophet is not a source of supernatural revelation but a mechanistic, physical subsystem for inferring temporal patterns from environmental data. Its "prophecy" is a falsifiable prediction generated by a resonant model, not a declaration of absolute truth.
