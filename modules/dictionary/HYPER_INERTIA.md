        The result is a state of **hyper-inertia**, where the system's interaction with its own immediate past is the dominant term in its equation of motion.

  art: |
    A river may wander when the land is flat, but a river that carves a canyon is bound to its course forever. Its history becomes its destiny.
  law: |
    A system exhibits hyper-inertia when the energy required to perturb it from its established trajectory scales super-linearly with the depth of its Wound Channel. Its own history becomes the primary determinant of its future state, making external influences comparatively negligible.
  philosophy: |
    Hyper-inertia is the architecture of both foundation and cage. It is the mechanism of identity, memory, and stability, yet it is also the prison of habit, dogma, and stagnation, demonstrating that perfect efficiency, sustained indefinitely, becomes a trap.
pirouette_definition: |
  The property of a system in a Resonance Trap (DOMA-150) characterized by extreme resistance to changes in its state or trajectory. This occurs when the system's interaction with its own past, encoded in a deep Wound Channel (CORE-011), becomes the dominant term in its equation of motion, effectively locking it into a highly coherent, self-reinforcing pattern.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a system in a stable, resonant state (Laminar Flow).
          2. Apply a calibrated energy pulse (perturbation) of magnitude ΔE, attempting to shift the system's state.
          3. Measure the resulting state deviation (δS).
          4. Hyper-inertia (Η) is inversely proportional to the deviation for a given input (Η ∝ ΔE / δS).
        expected_signals: [Minimal state deviation (δS → 0), rapid relaxation time back to the locked state]
        pitfalls: [Perturbation may be insufficient to overcome the energy barrier, resulting in no measurable deviation; perturbation may be too large, shattering the system entirely.]
context_windows:
  - module: DOMA-150
    excerpt: |
      A Lock occurs when a system's echo becomes louder than any new sound. It is best understood as a deep, self-reinforcing potential well on the coherence manifold—a Coherence Well. The result is a state of hyper-inertia, where the system's interaction with its own immediate past is the dominant term in its equation of motion.
  - module: DOMA-150
    excerpt: |
      The Wound Channel becomes so profound that it effectively *is* the system's reality. The path of least resistance is now a chasm, a fully formed Coherence Well. To deviate would require an immense expenditure of energy to fight against the inertia of its own accumulated history. The system is no longer choosing its path; it is locked.

      justification: |
        Hyper-inertia implies that a system's response to a force depends on its past states, the defining feature of hysteresis. The deep Wound Channel 'remembers' the system's path, making it difficult to reverse or alter its trajectory, akin to the magnetic memory in a hysteretic material requiring a coercive force to flip.

    - target: Ergodicity breaking
      domain: Statistical Mechanics
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        A system with hyper-inertia is trapped in a small sub-region of its total possible state space (a Coherence Well). It can no longer access the full phase space over time, which is a classic signature of broken ergodicity, such as in the transition from a liquid to a glass or crystal.
      confidence: 0.7
  adopted:
    - target: Hysteresis
      rationale: The concept of a system's state being dependent on its history and requiring a coercive force to change is the most direct and operational analogue.

  claims:
    - statement: "A system exhibiting hyper-inertia will demonstrate a non-zero, history-dependent response to a cyclical perturbing force, tracing a hysteresis loop in a plot of perturbation vs. system state."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "If a system identified as hyper-inertial shows a completely reversible, non-hysteretic response to any applied perturbation, its state would not depend on its history, falsifying the core mechanism."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from standard Newtonian inertia (resistance to change in velocity). Hyper-inertia is a systemic property related to state-space trajectory and pattern stability, not just momentum. It applies to non-physical systems (cognitive, social) and is a function of the system's accumulated history (Wound Channel), not its intrinsic mass.

# Hyper-inertia

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The property of a system in a Resonance Trap (DOMA-150) characterized by extreme resistance to changes in its state or trajectory. This occurs when the system's interaction with its own past, encoded in a deep Wound Channel (CORE-011), becomes the dominant term in its equation of motion, effectively locking it into a highly coherent, self-reinforcing pattern.

## EFT-First Summary
Hyper-inertia can be operationally mapped to the phenomenon of **hysteresis** in materials science. A system with high hyper-inertia behaves like a hard ferromagnetic material; its current state is strongly dependent on its history, and a significant coercive force (perturbation energy) is required to alter its state, which is "remembered" by the system's configuration. This memory is physically grounded in the Pirouette Framework as a deep Wound Channel.
