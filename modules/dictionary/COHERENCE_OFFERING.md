  art: |
    An act of giving is not a transaction but an invitation to a shared dance; it is a single note offered with the hope of forming a more beautiful, resonant chord.
  law: |
    The efficacy of an offering is determined not by its intrinsic value, but by its harmonic compatibility with the recipient and its application to a system possessing a 'coherence gap'—a state between rigidity and chaos where synthesis is possible.
  philosophy: |
    To give well is a strategic act of co-creation, transforming altruism from simple aid into a precise method for cultivating systemic coherence and participating consciously in the universe's growth.
pirouette_definition: |
  An act of generosity (e.g., a resource, idea, or support) viewed not as a transfer but as a resonant invitation intended to catalyze a synthesis between giver and receiver. Its purpose is to increase the recipient system's temporal coherence (`Kτ`). Its success is a function of its own resonant signature (the 'note'), its harmonic compatibility with the recipient (the 'key'), and its application to a recipient in a state of creative tension (the 'coherence gap').

        outline: |
          The potential efficacy of a Coherence Offering is not measured directly but is predicted by calculating an Attunement Score. This involves (1) Identifying potential recipients with high Harmonic Compatibility, (2) Assessing their Coherence Gap using the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003), and (3) Synthesizing these factors with Contextual Pressure (Γ) to rank candidates.
        expected_signals: [Increase in recipient's temporal coherence (ΔKτ > 0), Decrease in potential from temporal pressure (ΔV_Γ < 0), Observable progress towards Alchemical Union]
        pitfalls: [Misdiagnosing the recipient's state (e.g., offering stability to a system needing creative chaos), Offering a note that is harmonically incompatible, Ignoring ambient contextual pressure which can nullify the offering's effect]

      An act of generosity is not a transfer of resources; it is a **Coherence Offering**, an invitation to form a more beautiful chord. The Gardener's Compass is the tool for this art. It provides a method for moving beyond indiscriminate aid to the wise and resonant reinforcement of coherence where it is most needed and most ready to bloom.
  - module: DOMA-115
    excerpt: |
      A Coherence Offering is an invitation to a shared dance. Its success depends not on the value of the gift, but on the resonance between giver and receiver, and the readiness of the ground upon which it falls. The offering's Ki pattern must be harmonically related to the recipient's own internal state.

        DOMA-115 explicitly models the offering as a perturbation `δ𝓛` to the recipient's Lagrangian `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. This maps the act of giving directly onto a formal term in the principle of action, where the "best" gift is the one that maximally increases the action `S`.

  disambiguation: |
    A Coherence Offering is distinct from a simple transaction or gift. Its identity is defined by its resonant potential and intent to foster synthesis, not its material value. An offering can be resource-negative (e.g., a challenging question) if it resolves a critical dissonance for the recipient.

# Coherence Offering

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An act of generosity (e.g., a resource, idea, or support) viewed not as a transfer but as a resonant invitation intended to catalyze a synthesis between giver and receiver. Its purpose is to increase the recipient system's temporal coherence (`Kτ`). Its success is a function of its own resonant signature (the 'note'), its harmonic compatibility with the recipient (the 'key'), and its application to a recipient in a state of creative tension (the 'coherence gap').

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of classical mechanics, a Coherence Offering is a targeted perturbation (`δ𝓛`) applied to a system's Lagrangian. The goal is to select a perturbation and a recipient such that the system's total action is maximally increased, leading it towards a more stable and coherent state. This reframes altruism as a form of metaphysical engineering, optimizing interventions for maximum positive impact.
