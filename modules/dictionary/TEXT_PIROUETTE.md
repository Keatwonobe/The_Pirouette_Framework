    A measure of the residual tension where the scales of being (Higgs) and becoming (Γ-field) cancel, leaving the quiet hum of a balanced universe.
  law: |
    The fundamental curvature of the Γ-field potential, Λ_{\text{Pirouette}}, sets the scale of gravitational coupling via the relation G⁻¹ ∝ ω_c² / Λ_{\text{Pirouette}}. Its measured value must be ≈ 10⁻⁵² m⁻² to reproduce observed physics.
  philosophy: |
    Represents the ultimate 'softness' of the vacuum. Instead of a rigid Planck wall, Λ_{\text{Pirouette}} defines a pliable boundary, allowing for the resonant cancellation of divergences and establishing the mass hierarchy as a condition of stability, not of fine-tuning.
pirouette_definition: |
  A fundamental constant of the Pirouette framework representing the intrinsic curvature of the Γ-field potential in the electroweak vacuum. It functions as a boundary condition that anchors the derivation of the mass hierarchy and determines the scale of gravitational interaction as a residual coherence mismatch. It is the minimum achievable temporal pressure gradient.

          Cannot be measured directly. Its value is inferred by requiring that the Pirouette model of gravity, G⁻¹ ~ c⁴ ω_c² / (8π Λ_{\text{Pirouette}}), reproduces the experimentally measured value of Newton's constant, G. It is also constrained by measuring the cosmic acceleration rate.

      This module explicitly adopts the constants: [{m_Γ, m_H, ω_c, Λ_{\text{Pirouette}}}] from *Appendix A: Temporal-Pressure Resonance Atlas*, where [m² V''(\Gamma) = Λ_{\text{Pirouette}} ≈ 10⁻⁵² m⁻²]. These invariants serve as boundary conditions for the electroweak vacuum and anchor the hierarchy derivation.

        Λ_{\text{Pirouette}} has the same units (L⁻²) and approximate magnitude as the observed cosmological constant. In Pirouette, it arises from the ground-state curvature of the Γ-field potential, whereas in GR it is typically interpreted as intrinsic vacuum energy density.

    Λ_{\text{Pirouette}} is a fundamental *curvature* (units L⁻²), not an energy density (units M L⁻¹ T⁻²). The two are related via G, as in the standard Friedmann equations. It is a boundary condition for the electroweak scale, not just a cosmological parameter.

# Λ_{\text{Pirouette}}

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A fundamental constant of the Pirouette framework representing the intrinsic curvature of the Γ-field potential in the electroweak vacuum. It functions as a boundary condition that anchors the derivation of the mass hierarchy and determines the scale of gravitational interaction as a residual coherence mismatch. It is the minimum achievable temporal pressure gradient.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, Λ_{\text{Pirouette}} corresponds to the measured cosmological constant (Λ_CC ≈ 10⁻⁵² m⁻²). While in General Relativity this term is often added to the Einstein field equations to explain cosmic acceleration, Pirouette derives it as the fundamental ground-state curvature of the Γ-field potential. Its small, non-zero value is a prerequisite for the resonance mechanism that stabilizes the electroweak scale.
