  art: |
    Gravity is not the pull of matter, but the resonance of temporal elasticity. $G_{\text{eff}}$ is the constant of proportionality that translates the geometry of duration into the perceived force of attraction.
  law: |
    The inverse of the Emergent Gravitational Coupling is proportional to the temporal component of the effective metric on the τ-manifold: $G_{\text{eff}}^{-1} = 8\pi K_\Gamma$.
  philosophy: |
    By defining gravity as an emergent consequence of the temporal substrate's properties, $G_{\text{eff}}$ demotes it from a fundamental constant to a derived parameter. This completes the Pirouette framework's unification of forces and mass as manifestations of a single, underlying geometry.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Emergent Gravitational Coupling, $G_{\text{eff}}$, is a scalar parameter that relates the Ricci curvature of the temporal substrate, $\mathcal{R}_\tau$, to the mass-squared invariant, $\mathcal{M}^2$. It is defined via its inverse, $G_{\text{eff}}^{-1} = 8\pi K_\Gamma$, where $K_\Gamma$ is the dimensionless temporal coefficient of the effective metric on the τ-manifold. $G_{\text{eff}}$ serves as the effective gravitational constant within the Pirouette framework.

          1. Deploy a network of high-precision atomic clocks in regions with differing, known field curvatures (e.g., via satellite constellation).
          2. Measure the time dilation factor at each clock, which directly constrains the local value of $K_\Gamma$ from the metric $ds^2 = K_\Gamma\,d\tau^2 - \dots$.
          3. Compute $G_{\text{eff}}$ for each region using the relation $G_{\text{eff}} = (8\pi K_\Gamma)^{-1}$.
          4. Verify that variations in $G_{\text{eff}}$ correlate with the theoretically predicted variations in $K_\Gamma$.
        expected_signals: [Minute, periodic drifts in clock synchronization correlated with orbital position and local field strength.]

    excerpt: |
      We extend this by identifying the total invariant $\mathcal{M}^2 = \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 + \frac{\mathcal{R}_\tau}{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}}$, where $G_{\text{eff}}^{-1}=8\pi K_\Gamma$ acts as an emergent gravitational coupling. In regions of uniform curvature ($\mathcal{R}_\tau=0$), mass arises solely from stiffness; in curved regions, curvature contributes additively.

    excerpt: |
      Under τ-isometries (MATH-024L), the combination $\mathfrak{M}^2 = \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 + \frac{\mathrm{Tr}(F^2)}{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}} + \frac{\mathcal{R}_\tau}{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}}$ is invariant. Each term transforms as a scalar under τ reparametrization; the pullback via Σ preserves contraction with $G_{\text{eff}}^{-1}$.

        $G_{\text{eff}}$ plays the role of the gravitational constant in the framework's mass-curvature relation, $\mathcal{M}^2 = \dots + \mathcal{R}_\tau/(8\pi G_{\text{eff}})$, which is analogous to the structure of the Einstein–Hilbert action where $1/G_N$ multiplies the Ricci scalar $R$. It connects the geometry of a spacetime-like substrate to its energy-mass content.

    The subscript 'eff' (effective) distinguishes this term from the fundamental constant $G_N$ in General Relativity. In Pirouette, gravity is emergent, so its coupling constant is necessarily an effective, derived parameter rather than a fundamental one.

# Emergent Gravitational Coupling

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Emergent Gravitational Coupling, $G_{\text{eff}}$, is a scalar parameter that relates the Ricci curvature of the temporal substrate, $\mathcal{R}_\tau$, to the mass-squared invariant, $\mathcal{M}^2$. It is defined via its inverse, $G_{\text{eff}}^{-1} = 8\pi K_\Gamma$, where $K_\Gamma$ is the dimensionless temporal coefficient of the effective metric on the τ-manifold. $G_{\text{eff}}$ serves as the effective gravitational constant within the Pirouette framework.

## EFT-First Summary
In the low-curvature limit, $G_{\text{eff}}$ is operationally equivalent to Newton's gravitational constant, $G_N$. It links a geometric curvature term ($\mathcal{R}_\tau$) to a mass-energy scale, analogous to how $G_N$ relates the Ricci scalar to the stress-energy tensor in General Relativity. Unlike in GR, $G_{\text{eff}}$ is not a fundamental constant but emerges from the properties of the temporal substrate, specifically the metric component $K_\Gamma$. This implies that the strength of gravity could vary in regions where $K_\Gamma$ is expected to change.
