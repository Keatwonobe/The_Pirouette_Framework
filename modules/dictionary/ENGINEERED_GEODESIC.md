        It is an **engineered geodesic**, a pre-carved path of least resistance that makes a difficult but vital contribution not only possible, but sustainable. It is the architectural difference between a candle in a hurricane and a lamp in a lighthouse.

    A lighthouse built to house a candle, allowing its fragile light to guide ships through a storm. It is the architectural difference between sacrifice and sustainability; the quiet garden where the most precious work can be done.
  law: |
    A system's maximum sustainable coherence output is determined not by the generative capacity of its contributors, but by its structural ability to absorb Turbulent Blowback. An Engineered Geodesic modifies a system's potential landscape (`V_Œì`) to make the path of highest coherence output also the path of least action (`S_p`).
  philosophy: |
    To prevent a system from devouring its most generative members, its architecture must be deliberately shaped to protect the act of contribution. The highest form of system design is not to demand infinite resilience from individuals, but to build an environment where their gifts are no longer acts of self-destruction.
pirouette_definition: |
  An Engineered Geodesic is a deliberately constructed subsystem, process, or resource buffer‚Äîa 'Coherence Crucible'‚Äîcharacterized by low internal Temporal Pressure (`Œì`). It functions by absorbing the Turbulent Blowback from a generative act performed within or from it, thereby modifying the system's Lagrangian. This makes a high-coherence contribution a sustainable, low-cost path of action for the contributor, transforming a potential sacrifice into the system's most efficient trajectory.

          1. Identify a critical contributor ("weaver") exhibiting high `K_œÑ` and symptoms of Coherence Erosion.
          2. Establish a baseline by measuring their Coherence Erosion Rate (e.g., via reported stress, context-switching errors, project churn) and Coherence Output Rate (e.g., project velocity, key results achieved) over one cycle.
          3. Implement a candidate Geodesic (e.g., a "no-meetings" policy, a dedicated support role, a funding grant).
          4. Re-measure Erosion and Output rates over a subsequent cycle.

        The Crucible functions as an engineered local minimum in the system's potential energy landscape. An actor within this 'well' is in a stable state, protected from the higher potential of the external environment, allowing for sustained action without being ejected or degraded.

# Engineered Geodesic

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An Engineered Geodesic is a deliberately constructed subsystem, process, or resource buffer‚Äîa 'Coherence Crucible'‚Äîcharacterized by low internal Temporal Pressure (`Œì`). It functions by absorbing the Turbulent Blowback from a generative act performed within or from it, thereby modifying the system's Lagrangian. This makes a high-coherence contribution a sustainable, low-cost path of action for the contributor, transforming a potential sacrifice into the system's most efficient trajectory.

## EFT-First Summary
An Engineered Geodesic is conceptually analogous to creating an **Effective Potential Well** within a system's dynamics. By deliberately structuring a subsystem (e.g., via procedures, social contracts, or resource allocation), one lowers the local potential energy (`V_Œì_crucible`) associated with a generative act. This shields the actor from the high-cost potential of the wider environment, making sustained, high-output action (`K_œÑ`) a stable, low-energy trajectory, directly mapping to the principle of least action within a modified potential landscape as seen in classical mechanics.
