  art: |
    The universe's drumbeat. A Maw's spin winds the fabric of coherence until it snaps like a string, releasing a note of pure gravity before the winding begins anew.
  law: |
    When torsional stress on the coherence manifold, induced by a Maw's rotation, exceeds the local coherence limit, a catastrophic phase transition occurs, releasing the stored energy as a gravitational wave burst with a peak frequency in the GHz range. This process repeats at a stable rate between 10-100 Hz.
  philosophy: |
    The quake demonstrates that stability in the face of annihilation is not static, but rhythmic. It is the universe's mechanism for dissipating unsustainable stress, turning a point of no return into a periodic, information-rich broadcast.
pirouette_definition: |
  A periodic, catastrophic, but non-destructive phase transition of the local coherence manifold. The quake is triggered when torsional stress, induced by the extreme rotation of a Maw object, surpasses a critical coherence limit. The event abruptly releases the stored geometric energy as a high-frequency (GHz-range), millisecond-duration gravitational wave burst, after which the manifold returns to its ground state and the stress accumulation cycle restarts.
operational_definition:
  units: The quake is an event; its primary observables are the frequency of the resulting gravitational wave burst (Hz) and the repetition rate of the event cycle (Hz).

        outline: |
          Use a network of specialized, high-frequency gravitational wave detectors to perform a long-term, all-sky survey. Search the data for a persistent train of short, powerful bursts with a stable repetition rate in the 10-100 Hz range and individual burst frequencies in the 1-10 GHz range. A positive detection requires correlating the signal across multiple detectors to confirm astrophysical origin and rule out terrestrial noise.

    excerpt: |
      Instead, its existence is broadcast through a unique gravitational signature: the "Thumper," a rhythmic train of high-frequency bursts generated by a periodic, catastrophic phase transition in the local coherence manifold, a process termed a **Coherence Quake**. The detection of this signal would not only validate the Maw's existence but would also serve as a direct measurement of the same universal dynamics that offer a compelling alternative to the dark matter hypothesis.

      When the stress induced by the Maw's rotation exceeds this limit, the manifold undergoes a catastrophic but non-destructive phase transition. It "snaps," releasing the stored geometric stress in a violent, millisecond-duration shockwave. This propagating shockwave of pure temporal geometry *is* the gravitational wave burst—a single "thump."

      justification: |
        The quake mechanism is a direct conceptual analogue to stick-slip events. A driving force (Maw spin) builds stress (torsional) in a medium (coherence manifold) until it exceeds a static friction threshold (coherence limit), resulting in a rapid, catastrophic release of energy (GW burst). The system then "sticks" again, and the cycle repeats.

    A Coherence Quake is not a mechanical vibration of matter like a starquake. It is a fundamental phase transition of the coherence manifold itself—the substrate of spacetime geometry. The energy is released entirely as gravitational waves, not photons, neutrinos, or other particles.

# Coherence Quake

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A periodic, catastrophic, but non-destructive phase transition of the local coherence manifold. The quake is triggered when torsional stress, induced by the extreme rotation of a Maw object, surpasses a critical coherence limit. The event abruptly releases the stored geometric energy as a high-frequency (GHz-range), millisecond-duration gravitational wave burst, after which the manifold returns to its ground state and the stress accumulation cycle restarts.

## EFT-First Summary
No direct mapping to a standard Effective Field Theory term is currently adopted. The phenomenon is best understood conceptually as a recurring, catastrophic phase transition, analogous to stick-slip events in classical mechanics, where stored potential energy in a field is rapidly converted into propagating waves. Its formal description relies entirely on the dynamics of the Pirouette Lagrangian.
