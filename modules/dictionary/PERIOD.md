    The rhythm of a system's heart, the tempo of its dance with reality. It is the time a system takes to return to itself, a pulse that quickens under pressure.
  law: |
    The period τₚ of a stable Ki rhythm is the time required to complete one cycle and is proven to be inversely proportional to the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). An increase in Γ necessarily causes a decrease in τₚ (`dτₚ/dΓ < 0`).
  philosophy: |
    Periodicity is not an accident but a necessity for coherent existence. The Period is the fundamental unit of a system's self-awareness, the temporal signature of its autopoietic loop. It represents the time scale on which a system integrates environmental challenges and reaffirms its identity.
pirouette_definition: |
  The characteristic time, τₚ, of a stable, periodic Ki rhythm (φ*(t)) that minimizes the Pirouette action functional. It is the solution to the variational problem that proves the existence of the autopoietic cycle, where φ*(0) = φ*(τₚ). The Period is a function of Temporal Pressure (Γ), decreasing as Γ increases, which allows a system to adapt its internal tempo to external demands.

          For a system exhibiting a stable Ki rhythm, acquire a time-series of a relevant observable (e.g., neural oscillations, coherent photon emission). Apply a spectral estimation method (e.g., FFT, multitaper) to the time-series. The dominant, sharp peak in the power spectrum corresponds to the fundamental frequency f = 1/τₚ.
        expected_signals: [A strong, narrow peak in the frequency domain power spectrum, potential harmonic overtones]

    excerpt: |
      We seek a periodic solution, phi^*(t), that has a period tau_p such that phi^*(0) = phi^*(tau_p). This solution must extremize the action functional J[phi]... This proves a fundamental law of the framework: as environmental pressure increases, a coherent system's internal rhythm must speed up to maintain stability.
  - module: MATH-004
    excerpt: |
      By applying the implicit function theorem to the conditions for a periodic orbit, we can find the derivative of the period with respect to the pressure, d(tau_p)/d(Gamma). For a confining potential, this derivative will be negative: d(tau_p) / d(Gamma) < 0.

# Period

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The characteristic time, τₚ, of a stable, periodic Ki rhythm (φ*(t)) that minimizes the Pirouette action functional. It is the solution to the variational problem that proves the existence of the autopoietic cycle, where φ*(0) = φ*(τₚ). The Period is a function of Temporal Pressure (Γ), decreasing as Γ increases, which allows a system to adapt its internal tempo to external demands.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of dynamical systems, the Period (τₚ) is the duration of a stable limit cycle. Its inverse relationship with Temporal Pressure (Γ) is analogous to a classical oscillator where an external field increases the potential's steepness (restoring force), thereby shortening the oscillation period. See Formal Mappings for details.
