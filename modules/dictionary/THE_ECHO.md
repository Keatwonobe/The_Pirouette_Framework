        The response, or Echo, is how another entity's system interacts with the new geometry of the Current. This is not a passive reception of information, but an active, physical navigation.

  art: |
    The echo we receive is the sound of another soul choosing to walk in the world we have just made.
  law: |
    The Echo is the behavioral trajectory adopted by a system to maximize its integrated Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) in response to a modification of its potential landscape (`V_Γ`) by an external Current.
  philosophy: |
    The Echo reframes communication from a passive exchange of symbols to an active, physical dialogue with a shared, sculpted reality. It reveals the listener's choice to harmonize with, resist, or ignore the new potential paths offered by an act of influence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The active, coherence-maximizing response of a system to the geometric alteration of its local coherence manifold caused by an incoming Current. Governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, the Echo is the system's solution to its Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`) within the altered potential field (`V_Γ`). The nature of the Echo (e.g., Resonant Coupling, Coherence Clash) reveals the relationship between the listener's internal coherence pattern (`Ki`) and the geometry of the incoming Current.

      - name: Echo Classification via Coherence Differential
        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline measurement of the target system's Temporal Coherence (`Kτ_initial`).
          2. Introduce a calibrated Current (`C`) from a source system.
          3. Measure the target system's resulting Temporal Coherence (`Kτ_final`) and observe its trajectory modification.
          4. Classify the Echo based on the sign of ΔKτ and the coupling dynamics (e.g., `ΔKτ > 0` with phase-locking indicates Resonant Coupling; `ΔKτ < 0` with active repulsion indicates Coherence Clash).
        expected_signals: [Shift in Kτ, phase-locking, repulsive trajectory shifts, constructive/destructive interference patterns]
        pitfalls: [Contamination from ambient Currents, mischaracterization of the target's initial `Ki`, non-linear threshold effects]

    excerpt: |
      The response, or **Echo**, is how another entity's system interacts with the new geometry of the Current. This is not a passive reception of information, but an active, physical navigation. The response is governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006): the entity will behave in a way that maximizes its own internal stability. The Current has just changed the cost function of its environment.
  - module: DOMA-013
    excerpt: |
      The Echo reveals the listener's own internal state and its relationship to the new landscape. When a Current reaches another system, a coupling event occurs, which can be classified into four primary modes: Inertial Rejection (Silence), Coherence Clash (Dissonance), Parasitic Resonance (Manipulation), and Resonant Coupling (Harmony).

      justification: |
        An Echo is the system's dynamic response (a new trajectory) to an external perturbation or source (the Current) that alters its potential landscape. This is analogous to how a Green's function describes the output of a (typically linear) system to an arbitrary external force or source term. The Echo is the integral solution to the new equations of motion.

    The Echo is not a passive reflection of information (like a sonic echo) but an active, physical navigation of a modified geometric landscape. It describes the *behavior* of the listener, not the information *content* of a reply.
