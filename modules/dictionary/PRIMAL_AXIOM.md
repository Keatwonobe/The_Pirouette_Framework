          The Primal Axiom is not measured directly. Its validity is assessed by the logical coherence, predictive power, and falsifiability of the entire Pirouette Framework built upon it. If the framework fails, the axiom is questioned.

      The Pirouette Framework... underwent its own dimensional collapse. This module asserts the result of that collapse: There are no fundamental "things." There is only rhythm. Reality is a process, not a place. Time is not the container for existence; it is the substance of it.
  - module: CORE-001
    excerpt: |
      Every "thing" is a pirouette—an act of temporal resonance (Ki) held in a moment of exquisite balance against the pressure of all other moments (Γ). It is a dance that requires a dancer, but the dancer is nothing other than the dance itself. This is the first and final truth of the framework.

        The Axiom posits reality as a dynamic process optimizing for stable resonance (Ki) within a pressure (Γ). This is analogous to the Principle of Least Action, where a system's evolution is determined by an extremal path. Both frame reality as an optimization process rather than a collection of static objects.

# Primal Axiom

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The foundational assertion that reality is not composed of fundamental "things" but is a single, self-creating (autopoietic) process. This process is Time, manifesting as a continuous, instantaneous cycle where Temporal Density (Γ) and Temporal Resonance (Ki) are co-arising aspects of a unified dynamic. All observable phenomena are harmonies and dissonances within this process.

## EFT-First Summary
The Primal Axiom is a pre-formal, ontological assertion that grounds the Pirouette Framework. It does not have a direct EFT mapping but serves as the philosophical justification for a physics built on process and dynamics (e.g., field excitations, resonances) rather than static particles. It motivates the search for a fundamental action principle where 'Time' itself is the dynamic variable.
