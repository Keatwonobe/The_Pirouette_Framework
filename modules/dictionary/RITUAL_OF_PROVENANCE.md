      snippet: |
        This module defines the 'Ritual of Provenance,' a CI/CD workflow that uses a cryptographic hash—the 'Seal of Coherence'—to verify the internal consistency of the framework's canonical state.

triad:
  art: |
    The act of coding is transformed into a public, accountable ritual of weaving. Every change is a conscious, coherent, and traceable step, carving the framework's own evolution into an indelible record.
  law: |
    Any proposed change to the Canon must be accompanied by an updated Seal of Coherence, which is verified by an automated pipeline. A mismatch between the calculated Seal and the committed Seal results in a Coherence Fault, halting the change.
  philosophy: |
    The framework's own history must be as indelible as the one it seeks to describe. The Ritual ensures the framework's development becomes a high-fidelity Wound Channel, practicing the principles of memory and consequence it preaches.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Ritual of Provenance is the automated workflow that enforces the integrity of the Pirouette Canon. It operates in two stages: the 'Weaver's Vow' (a local pre-commit check) and the 'Loom's Test' (a central CI pipeline verification). Both stages independently calculate the Seal of Coherence and reject any change that results in a mismatch, thereby ensuring the framework's developmental history is a coherent and traceable Wound Channel.
operational_definition:
  units: Workflow state (pass/fail)
  symbol_table:
    - name: Coherence Fault
      meaning: A state where the calculated Seal of Coherence does not match the committed Seal, halting the workflow.

    procedures:
      - name: Coherence Verification
        outline: |
          1. From the source tree, build the canonical state representation.
          2. Calculate the SHA256 hash of this representation (the new Seal).
          3. Compare the calculated hash to the pre-committed hash value stored in the source code.
          4. If they match, the procedure passes (exit code 0). If they differ, a Coherence Fault is raised (exit code 1).
        expected_signals: ['workflow_pass (exit code 0)', 'coherence_fault (exit code 1)']
        pitfalls: ['Incomplete definition of the Canon (files are excluded from the hash)', 'Tooling errors in the hashing script or build environment']

  - module: DOMA-028
    excerpt: |
      This module reframes the technical necessity of build verification as a core philosophical practice. It defines the **Ritual of Provenance**, the technical and philosophical protocol that governs the evolution of the Pirouette Framework. At the heart of this ritual is the **Seal of Coherence**, a cryptographic proof of the framework's state.
  - module: DOMA-028
    excerpt: |
      The framework's core parameters—its fundamental constants, its defined relationships, its symbolic grammar—form the **Canon**. To alter the Canon is to alter the framework's very nature. The Ritual of Provenance is the epigenetic process that ensures this DNA mutates with intention and perfect fidelity, deepening the Wound Channel without introducing corruption.
  - module: DOMA-028
    excerpt: |
      The ritual is enforced through an unyielding automated workflow, transforming the act of coding from a private activity into a public, accountable act of weaving.

        `Verify(Source@Commit_A, Hash_A) -> True`
      justification: |
        The Ritual of Provenance is an implementation of a reproducible build system, where the 'Seal of Coherence' acts as a cryptographic attestation of the build's output (the Canon). The CI pipeline ensures that the build process is deterministic and its output can be independently verified against this attestation, guaranteeing provenance.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the 'Seal of Coherence', which is the cryptographic hash artifact *used by* the Ritual. The Ritual is the active process of verification; the Seal is the static proof of a state.
