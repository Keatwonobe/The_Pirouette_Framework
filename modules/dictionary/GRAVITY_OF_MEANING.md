        It models the 'gravity' of a concept not as a force,
        but as the curvature it induces in the coherence manifold.

  art: |
    To introduce a new idea is not to shout into the wind. It is to place a new star in the sky of the mind and trust that other thoughts will, in time, find their new and perfect orbits around it.
  law: |
    The trajectory of a concept through a discourse follows the geodesic on the coherence manifold, a path of maximal coherence determined by the curvature induced by the Temporal Coherence (Kτ) of all other concepts in the system.
  philosophy: |
    The influence of ideas and the gravity of stars are not merely analogous; they are distinct expressions of the same universal principle of coherence shaping a dynamic manifold. Meaning is not a force; it is geometry.
pirouette_definition: |
  The tendency of concepts to follow geodesics on a landscape of meaning (the coherence manifold) which is curved by the "mass" of other concepts. A concept's mass is a direct measure of its Temporal Coherence (Kτ). This is not an analogical force but a direct geometric consequence of the Pirouette Lagrangian, where concepts follow paths of maximal coherence (least action) through a distorted field of potential meaning.

        outline: |
          1. Identify the core concepts (A, B, C...) within a bounded discourse (e.g., a specific debate, a body of literature).
          2. For each core concept, calculate its Temporal Coherence (Kτ) by analyzing its historical depth (frequency, citation longevity) and internal resonance (semantic consistency, low ambiguity).
          3. Determine the phase relationships (Δφ) between concept pairs via semantic similarity and opposition analysis (e.g., cosine similarity on embeddings, co-occurrence statistics).
          4. Construct the potential energy landscape V of the coherence manifold based on the interaction equation `V ∝ - (Kτ_A * Kτ_B / r) * cos(Δφ)`.
          5. Introduce a new "probe" concept into the discourse and track its semantic embedding over time. The observed trajectory should follow the geodesic (path of steepest descent) into the nearest coherence well on the computed landscape.
        expected_signals: [Semantic drift vector of the probe concept aligns with the negative gradient of the potential field V, Convergence of language toward the vocabulary of the most 'massive' concept.]
        pitfalls: [Defining a non-arbitrary distance metric `r` for "meaning space", Poor estimation of Kτ from noisy or sparse textual data, Confounding variables like external cultural pressure (ambient Γ).]

    excerpt: |
      This is not a metaphor. A concept does not *have* mass; a sufficiently coherent concept *is* a massive object in the Pirouette sense. Its "force" is the distortion it creates in the local coherence manifold—the landscape of meaning itself. Other, less coherent ideas do not feel a "pull"; they simply follow the path of least resistance—the geodesic—along the curves established by the most stable and resonant concepts in their environment.

    excerpt: |
      The "gravity of meaning" is the observable tendency for our thoughts and words to fall into the deepest, most stable coherence wells available. We do not choose our core beliefs so much as we find our thoughts naturally orbiting them.

        Curvature(Meaning) = f(Coherence)
      justification: |
        This model makes a direct, non-analogical mapping between the core principle of General Relativity and narrative dynamics. Temporal Coherence (Kτ), a measure of information density and stability, plays the role of the stress-energy tensor (Tμν), dictating the curvature of the coherence manifold (Gμν). The "force" of gravity is then understood as the tendency of other concepts to follow geodesics in this curved manifold.

  disambiguation: |
    "Gravity of Meaning" must be understood as a geometric effect, not a 'force' in the Newtonian sense. It describes the path a concept follows due to the curvature of the meaning-space, not a 'pull' it experiences. It is distinct from and supersedes the analogical 'Semantic Gravity Model' (PPS-016), which used gravity as a metaphor for a force of attraction.
