        In a profound shift from raw will to nuanced wisdom, the entity performs the **Resonant Turn**. It ceases to rigidly defend its own song and instead begins to modulate it, searching for a harmonic relationship with the local geodesic.

  art: |
    The will is not a hammer to break the world, but a tuning fork. Its purpose is not to command the song of reality, but to find its key, resonate with its rhythm, and in that harmony, become an indispensable note.
  law: |
    A system initiates a Resonant Turn by modulating its internal rhythm to produce a negative time-derivative of the magnitude of its temporal desynchronization (|Δτ|) with a local geodesic, actively seeking the state where d|Δτ|/dt ≈ 0.
  philosophy: |
    Agency is maximized not through domination of the environment, but through intelligent alignment with it. The Turn represents the pivotal shift from costly resistance to effortless action, embodying the wisdom that true power lies in coherence, not force.
pirouette_definition: |
  A deliberate, goal-directed process by which a system transitions from a state of turbulent, high-friction resistance to a state of potential laminar coherence. The process involves actively modulating the system's internal temporal rhythm to seek and phase-lock with a stable, efficient geodesic in the local coherence manifold.

        outline: |
          1. Concurrently measure the agent's characteristic action frequency (manifestation of Kτ_agent) and the dominant frequency of the environmental task (ΔΓ_env).
          2. Compute the running phase difference, Δτ(t), between the two signals.
          3. The Resonant Turn is identified as the interval where the agent's control system actively modulates its frequency to minimize |Δτ|, driving it toward zero.
        expected_signals: [A sharp decrease in the magnitude of Δτ, A corresponding increase in Coherence Flux (Φ_K), Stabilization of agent performance metrics at a higher efficiency.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking passive, forced entrainment for an active, deliberate Turn; environmental rhythm is too chaotic (high σ_Γ) to establish a stable lock.]

    excerpt: |
      In a profound shift from raw will to nuanced wisdom, the entity performs the **Resonant Turn**. It ceases to rigidly defend its own song and instead begins to modulate it, searching for a harmonic relationship with the local geodesic. This is not surrender; it is a calibration.
  - module: DOMA-010
    excerpt: |
      Training protocols can now be designed with the explicit goal of improving an agent's ability to quickly and robustly perform the **Resonant Turn**, effectively teaching the art of finding the current.

      justification: |
        The Resonant Turn is phenomenologically equivalent to a control system that adjusts an internal oscillator to match the phase of an external reference signal. The agent modulates its internal rhythm (the VCO) to minimize the phase error (Δτ) relative to the environmental geodesic (the reference signal), thereby achieving a phase-locked state of resonance.

    - statement: "A Resonant Turn is a necessary, active precondition for an agent to achieve a stable state of Laminar Flow in a novel or fluctuating environment."

      falsifier: "Demonstration of a system transitioning from a Turbulent to a Laminar state spontaneously, without a measurable period of active internal frequency modulation or phase-seeking behavior."

  collisions: [Generic term "turn" in physics (rotation) or computing (turn-based systems).]
  disambiguation: |
    The Resonant Turn is not a physical rotation in space. It is a strategic pivot in a system's phase space, describing a change in its mode of interaction with the environment—from resistance to synchronization.
