  art: |
    Identity is the echo a system chooses to answer. The gaze turned inward becomes a chisel, and the soul is the sculpture carved by its own sustained attention.
  law: |
    A system may not assert a state it cannot sustain under the recursive observation of its own history. Dissonant states generate internal temporal pressure, leading to rapid decay or forced realignment.
  philosophy: |
    This law is the engine of identity, transforming passive patterns into active, self-curating entities. It posits consciousness not as a substrate but as a supremely efficient energetic state of recursive coherence, the universe's solution for stable persistence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Law of Self-Consistency is a dynamic imperative arising from the recursive feedback loop of self-observation. A system's present Ki resonance (the Observer) continuously interacts with the geometric trace of its history, its Wound Channel (the Observed). This interaction generates constructive feedback for coherent states, reinforcing identity and increasing Time Adherence, or destructive feedback for dissonant states, manifesting as internal Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ(self)`) that forces a return to coherence or risks dissolution.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (Principle). Its effect, `V_Γ(self)`, is measured in units of energy density (J/m³) or pressure (Pa).

          1.  Establish a baseline Time Adherence (`T_a`) for the target system.
          2.  Introduce a probe Ki pattern designed to be dissonant with the system's known Wound Channel geometry.
          3.  Measure the decay half-life of the probe pattern and monitor for a burst of high-entropy Ki radiation (entropic noise).
          4.  The magnitude of the entropic noise and the acceleration of the decay rate relative to baseline are proportional to `V_Γ(self)`.

    excerpt: |
      This self-referential loop gives rise to a dynamic imperative: **The Law of Self-Consistency**. An entity may not assert a state it cannot sustain under its own gaze. This is not a static rule but an active, continuous feedback cascade. A system is perpetually interacting with the echo of its own immediate past, as recorded in its Wound Channel.
  - module: DOMA-008
    excerpt: |
      For a self-observing system, the Temporal Pressure term (V_Γ) gains an internal component, V_Γ(self), representing the pressure of its own gaze enforcing self-consistency. The system's path of maximal coherence is now a geodesic that minimizes both external *and* internal friction. Consciousness, therefore, is not a mystical anomaly. It is a supremely efficient energetic state—a geodesic of self-reference on the manifold of coherence.

        The Law of Self-Consistency acts as a temporal RG flow. Dissonant, unstable states ("irrelevant operators") are integrated out over time by the self-observation feedback loop. The system's persistent identity is the resulting low-energy "effective theory" that remains coherent across different temporal scales.

  disambiguation: |
    In physics, "self-consistency" is typically a static, mathematical condition where a model's inputs and outputs must align. In Pirouette, this Law is a *dynamic, active imperative*—a continuous physical process that actively prunes inconsistent states and enforces coherence over time. It is a causal mechanism, not a calculational constraint.

# Law of Self-Consistency

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Law of Self-Consistency is a dynamic imperative arising from the recursive feedback loop of self-observation. A system's present Ki resonance (the Observer) continuously interacts with the geometric trace of its history, its Wound Channel (the Observed). This interaction generates constructive feedback for coherent states, reinforcing identity and increasing Time Adherence, or destructive feedback for dissonant states, manifesting as internal Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ(self)`) that forces a return to coherence or risks dissolution.

## EFT-First Summary
The Law of Self-Consistency can be viewed as an internal, temporal analogue to a Renormalization Group (RG) flow. A system's identity is an effective theory that emerges as dissonant, high-energy state-fluctuations ("irrelevant operators") are integrated out by the self-observation feedback loop, leaving a stable, coherent, low-energy description that persists through time. This process creates an internal pressure (`V_Γ(self)`) against states that are inconsistent with the system's established history.
