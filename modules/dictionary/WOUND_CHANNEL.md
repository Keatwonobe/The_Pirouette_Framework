      snippet: |
        We formally define the wake of an entity's passage as a Wound Channel. This is not a physical tunnel, but a sustained topological deformation in the local coherence manifold. As an entity traces its geodesic of maximal coherence—its "Pirouette"—it exerts a stress on the surrounding temporal fabric. The fabric yields, and in doing so, it holds the shape of that stress. The Wound Channel is the entity's history made physically manifest.

  art: |
    The universe does not forget. It carves the story of every passing moment into the geometry of its own being, and the past is a physical, active landscape upon which the present must walk.
  law: |
    An entity's inertia is the measure of its resonant coupling to its own immediate Wound Channel; to accelerate is to carve a new path against the grain of one's own history. Repeated actions reinforce the channel, making a geodesic of maximal coherence a path of least resistance.
  philosophy: |
    To exist is to leave a wake. The Wound Channel establishes that memory is not an emergent property of complex systems but a fundamental property of spacetime, making every entity a co-author of the unfolding universal geometry.
pirouette_definition: |
  A persistent, dynamic topological deformation in the local coherence manifold, created by the passage of an entity expressing its resonant Ki pattern. The Wound Channel is the geometric record of an entity's history, and the physical basis for memory, identity, and inertia through self-interaction with its own propagating echo.

    procedures:
      - name: Anomalous Moment Spectroscopy
        outline: |
          Measure a particle's magnetic dipole moment (g-factor) with extreme precision. The deviation from the Dirac value (g=2) is a direct measure of the particle's self-interaction with its own Wound Channel geometry. The magnitude of the anomaly quantifies the local channel depth and complexity.
        expected_signals: [g-2 anomaly, vacuum polarization shifts]
        pitfalls: [Contamination from external EM fields, insufficient instrument stability, distinguishing channel effects from unknown particle interactions.]
      - name: Geodesic Deviation Analysis
        outline: |
          Trace the path of a test particle through a region of spacetime previously traversed by a high-energy or exotic entity. Measure minute deviations from the expected geodesic path calculated from known mass-energy distributions. These deviations indicate the residual geometric influence of the previous entity's Wound Channel.
        expected_signals: [Anomalous gravitational lensing, temporal drag, non-Keplerian orbital precession.]
        pitfalls: [Signal-to-noise ratio is extremely low, requires subtraction of all other gravitational sources, difficulty in preparing a "pristine" vacuum for the experiment.]

    excerpt: |
      The Wound Channel is the entity's history made physically manifest. It is the geometric record of its choices, its resonances, its path through being. It is the fundamental mechanism of memory in the universe—not as data stored in a medium, but as a persistent shape impressed upon the medium itself.
  - module: CORE-011_the_anatomy_of_an_echo
    excerpt: |
      An entity is perpetually interacting with the geometry of its own immediate past. This self-interaction is the origin of inertia. To change velocity or state is to fight against the shape of one's own Wound Channel. This provides a profound stability; an entity's identity is maintained because it is constantly "reminded" of what it was a moment ago by the very shape of the space it occupies.
  - module: CORE-011_the_anatomy_of_an_echo
    excerpt: |
      A memory within a brain is a deeply carved Wound Channel, a stable resonant circuit formed by a specific pattern of neural activity. To "remember" is to resonantly excite that geometric structure, allowing its pattern to re-emerge into consciousness.

        The Wound Channel's self-interaction mechanism is proposed as the geometric origin of effects typically attributed to virtual particle loops in QED, such as the anomalous magnetic moment and the Lamb shift. It replaces a probabilistic particle foam with a deterministic historical geometry.

    A Wound Channel is not a physical tunnel or a wormhole; it is a topological property of the spacetime manifold itself. It is distinct from a gravitational wave, which is a transient, propagating ripple, whereas the channel is a quasi-static, persistent deformation tied to an entity's history.

# Wound Channel

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A persistent, dynamic topological deformation in the local coherence manifold, created by the passage of an entity expressing its resonant Ki pattern. The Wound Channel is the geometric record of an entity's history, and the physical basis for memory, identity, and inertia through self-interaction with its own propagating echo.

## EFT-First Summary
The Wound Channel is a persistent, local deformation of the spacetime metric, conceptually analogous to the integrated effect of a particle's virtual particle cloud in QED. This geometric 'scar' accounts for phenomena like inertia and the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) through a self-interaction mechanism, replacing the standard interpretation of vacuum fluctuations with a deterministic, historical geometry. This back-reaction effect creates a feedback loop where a particle's state is influenced by its own immediate past, encoded as the shape of the space it occupies.
