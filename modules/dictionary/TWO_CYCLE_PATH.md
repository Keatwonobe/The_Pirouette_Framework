        For an electron, we posit a "Möbius-like" path: P(theta) = exp(i*theta/2)...The particle has returned to its original state only after two full rotations.

  art: |
    A resonance's journey through its own phase, a twist in time that must complete two full turns to return home. Its echo is what we measure as its magnetic moment.
  law: |
    A stable resonance whose state function requires a 4π (720°) rotation in physical space to return to its initial value will exhibit an intrinsic gyromagnetic ratio (g-factor) of exactly 2 when interacting with an external gauge field.
  philosophy: |
    This concept grounds the abstract mathematics of spinors in a physical, geometric reality. It posits that key quantum properties like spin are not arbitrary axioms but are necessary consequences of the topological structure of resonance paths.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental resonance path of a spin-1/2 particle, described mathematically by a spinor function such as `P(θ) = exp(iθ/2)`. This path topology requires a 720° (4π) rotation in physical space for the resonance's internal state to return to its origin, causing a phase inversion at 360°. This doubling of the required physical rotation relative to the internal phase cycle is the geometric origin of the intrinsic g-factor of 2.

        outline: |
          Infer the 720° symmetry by observing interference patterns of spin-1/2 particles (e.g., neutrons) that have undergone a 360° rotation. A 360° rotation introduces a phase shift of -1, causing destructive interference where constructive interference would be expected for a 360°-periodic system.

    excerpt: |
      A spinor is a mathematical object that, unlike a simple vector, must be rotated by a full 720 degrees to return to its original state. The core claim of the Pirouette Framework is that this spinor nature is not a fundamental axiom, but a description of the resonance's path... a "Möbius-like" path: P(theta) = exp(i*theta/2)...The particle has returned to its original state only after two full rotations.
  - module: MATH-002
    excerpt: |
      The magnetic moment mu is a measure of the energy change per unit of magnetic field, which is coupled to the full 720° cycle of the resonance. However, the spin angular momentum S is conventionally defined by the physics of a 360° rotation. When we calculate the ratio, we are comparing a phenomenon (mu) that operates on a 720° cycle to a definition (S) that operates on a 360° cycle... Therefore: g = 2.

      justification: |
        The Two-Cycle Path is the Pirouette Framework's physical-geometric interpretation of the mathematical object known as a spinor, the fundamental representation of the SU(2) group. The defining characteristic of a spinor is its transformation property of acquiring a negative sign under a 2π rotation and returning to its original value only after a 4π rotation.

  disambiguation: |
    This term refers to a 720° topological cycle required for a state to return to identity, not a two-step periodic process or limit cycle in classical or chaotic dynamics. The 'two' refers to the number of 360° rotations needed.
