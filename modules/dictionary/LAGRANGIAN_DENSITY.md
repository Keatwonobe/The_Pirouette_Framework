    The dynamics of the fundamental fields C(x) and Γ(x) are governed by the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from this Lorentz scalar function, such that the action S = ∫ 𝓛 d⁴x is stationary.
  philosophy: |
    By encoding the framework's core dynamics into a Lorentz scalar, 𝓛 ensures that the Principle of Maximal Coherence is not a subjective rule but a fundamental, observer-independent law of spacetime.

𝓛 is composed of covariant kinetic terms, representing the energy cost of creating field gradients, and a potential term V(|C|², Γ) that encodes the core interactions driving the autopoietic formation of resonant, coherent structures. This function is the fundamental, covariant origin of the conceptual Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛ₚ).

        outline: |
          The functional form of 𝓛, particularly its potential term V(|C|², Γ), is not measured directly at a point. Instead, its parameters are constrained by comparing theoretical predictions (derived from its Euler-Lagrange equations) with high-energy experimental observations. Key observables include particle masses, decay rates, and scattering cross-sections.

        The Pirouette Lagrangian Density is a specific model constructed within the standard mathematical formalism of covariant field theory. It takes the canonical form `𝓛 = (Kinetic Terms) - (Potential Term)`, consistent with the construction of Lagrangians for scalar fields in the Standard Model and theories of cosmic inflation. The mapping is a direct application of the formalism.

  collisions: [The symbol `L` (non-calligraphic) is often used for the Lagrangian (`L = ∫ 𝓛 d³x`), which is the spatial integral of the Lagrangian Density. Care must be taken to distinguish 𝓛 (density, a function of a spacetime point) from L (a function of time).]

    The conceptual Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛ₚ) describes the felt, frame-dependent experience of a coherent system striving to maximize its stability. In contrast, the Lagrangian Density (𝓛) is the fundamental, Lorentz-invariant scalar quantity that governs the underlying fields for all observers, from which 𝓛ₚ emerges as a localized, non-relativistic limit.

# Lagrangian Density

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Lorentz scalar function of the Coherence Field (C), the Temporal Pressure Field (Γ), and their spacetime derivatives. Its integral over all spacetime defines the universal Action (S). 𝓛 is composed of covariant kinetic terms, representing the energy cost of creating field gradients, and a potential term V(|C|², Γ) that encodes the core interactions driving the autopoietic formation of resonant, coherent structures. This function is the fundamental, covariant origin of the conceptual Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛ₚ).

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette Lagrangian Density is a direct application of the standard Quantum Field Theory (QFT) formalism. It posits a specific model, `𝓛 = T - V`, for two fundamental scalar fields (one complex, one real) whose dynamics are intended to reproduce all observed phenomenology. The mapping to the standard QFT `Lagrangian Density` is mathematical and direct, allowing the use of established techniques like the path integral and perturbation theory. See: Peskin & Schroeder, *An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory* (1995).
