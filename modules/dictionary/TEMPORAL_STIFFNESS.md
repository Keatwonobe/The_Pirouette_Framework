  art: |
    Temporal Stiffness is the inertia of the universe's dream-stuff against waking into time. It is the friction of the absolute clock, a drag on the very act of becoming, which sculpts the flow of moments we perceive.
  law: |
    Temporal Stiffness \(K_{Ki}\) is the positive-definite coefficient of the temporal kinetic term \(|\partial_\tau Ki|^2\) in the substrate Lagrangian. It sets the proportional relationship between the square of the observer time interval \(dt^2\) and the square of the substrate time interval \(d\tau^2\), thereby normalizing the emergent speed of light. All fields sharing a causal structure must exhibit a ratio of Spatial to Temporal Stiffness equal to a universal constant \(c^2\).
  philosophy: |
    This parameter embodies the principle that observed dynamics are emergent from a more fundamental, anisotropic substrate. \(K_{Ki}\) separates the intrinsic "tick rate" of the substrate from a field's kinetic response, which in turn defines an observer's clock. It is a direct measure of how the substrate's structure is translated into the relativistic physics of the observer frame.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Temporal Stiffness, \(K_{Ki}\), is a fundamental positive scalar parameter in the substrate action, defined as the coefficient of the kinetic term \(|\partial_\tau Ki|^2\) for the complex scalar Ki field. It quantifies the kinetic energy of the field per unit substrate time derivative. Along with Spatial Stiffness \(\Lambda_{Ki}\), it governs the propagation of Ki modes on the time substrate \(\mathcal M_\tau\). \(K_{Ki}\) is essential for defining the observer's time coordinate via the rescaling \(t = \sqrt{K_{Ki}}\,\tau\), which allows the anisotropic substrate Lagrangian to manifest as a Lorentz-covariant theory in the observer frame.

        outline: |
          \(K_{Ki}\) is not directly observable but can be constrained by relating observer-frame and substrate-frame parameters.
          1. Measure the observed physical mass of the Ki particle, \(m_{Ki}\), through standard particle physics experiments (e.g., invariant mass reconstruction from decay products).
          2. Theoretically model the substrate mass parameter, \(m_{Ki,\tau}^2\), which includes contributions from fundamental parameters and couplings to other fields like \(\Gamma\) (e.g., \(m_{Ki,\tau}^2 = m_0^2 + \xi_\Gamma\,\Gamma_0^2\)).
          3. Calculate \(K_{Ki}\) using the definitional relation \(K_{Ki} = m_{Ki,\tau}^2 / m_{Ki}^2\). The value is determined relative to the theoretical model of the substrate.
        expected_signals: [A specific value for \(m_{Ki}\) from collider or cosmological data.]
        pitfalls: [The inference is highly model-dependent, relying on knowledge of all substrate parameters contributing to \(m_{Ki,\tau}\). Any error in the substrate model propagates directly to the inferred value of \(K_{Ki}\).]

# Temporal Stiffness

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Temporal Stiffness, \(K_{Ki}\), is a fundamental positive scalar parameter in the substrate action, defined as the coefficient of the kinetic term \(|\partial_\tau Ki|^2\) for the complex scalar Ki field. It quantifies the kinetic energy of the field per unit substrate time derivative. Along with Spatial Stiffness \(\Lambda_{Ki}\), it governs the propagation of Ki modes on the time substrate \(\mathcal M_\tau\). \(K_{Ki}\) is essential for defining the observer's time coordinate via the rescaling \(t = \sqrt{K_{Ki}}\,\tau\), which allows the anisotropic substrate Lagrangian to manifest as a Lorentz-covariant theory in the observer frame.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory, Temporal Stiffness \(K_{Ki}\) acts as a non-canonical coefficient for the kinetic term \(|\partial_\tau Ki|^2\) defined in the pre-spacetime "substrate" coordinates. It normalizes the emergent, observable time coordinate via \(t = \sqrt{K_{Ki}}\,\tau\) and rescales the field's mass parameter via \(m_{Ki}^2 = m_{Ki,\tau}^2 / K_{Ki}\). For emergent Lorentz invariance, its ratio with the Spatial Stiffness \(\Lambda_{Ki}\) must match the universal light-speed constant \(c^2\), analogous to fixing the sound cone in a condensed matter system. Its value is absorbed into the definition of observer-frame clocks and masses, and can only be inferred by relating observed parameters to their fundamental substrate counterparts.
