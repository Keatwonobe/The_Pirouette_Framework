      snippet: |
        XAP-006E extends the unified mass–curvature relation to cosmological scales.
        Residual Γ-stiffness acts as the vacuum’s elastic memory, producing an effective Λ that evolves slowly with the Universe’s coherence.
        Dark energy and particle mass emerge as two limits of the same temporal elasticity, completing the Pirouette framework’s geometric–cosmological arc.

    The time substrate’s elastic memory, where the universe's expansion is the faint, lingering echo of a once-vibrant temporal spring.
  law: |
    The invariant sum of squared Γ-stiffness and temporal curvature, $\mathfrak{M}^2=\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2+\mathcal{R}_\tau/(8\pi G_{\mathrm{eff}})$, is a conserved quantity. This single law sources both particle mass locally and cosmic acceleration globally from the same fundamental parameter.
  philosophy: |
    Γ-Stiffness unifies the origin of mass and dark energy, revealing them not as separate phenomena but as two distinct manifestations—local and global—of the time substrate's fundamental elasticity. It reframes the cosmological constant problem as a question of residual stress in the fabric of time.
pirouette_definition: |
  The primary parameter, Γ_stiff, quantifying the time substrate's resistance to deformation. At high coherence, its value sets the scale for particle masses via the unified invariant $\mathfrak{M}^2$. In the low-coherence cosmological limit, its residual vacuum fluctuations, $\langle(\delta\Gamma)^2\rangle$, manifest as an effective cosmological constant, Λ_eff, driving cosmic acceleration.

    excerpt: |
      The same stiffness parameter that generated particle masses (XAP-006C) now determines Λ. Thus Λ is not an arbitrary constant but the *vacuum echo* of the time substrate’s residual elasticity. Since $\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}$ slowly renormalizes with cosmic scale (MATH-026 flow), Λ is not strictly constant but undergoes adiabatic decay, potentially explaining the late-time acceleration plateau.
  - module: XAP-006E_Λ_as_residual_Γ-stiffness
    excerpt: |
      At present epoch, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}} \approx 250~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $\langle(\delta\Gamma)^2\rangle^{1/2} \sim 10^{-28}~\mathrm{GeV}$, yielding $\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}^{1/4}\!\sim\!2~\mathrm{meV}$, in excellent agreement with observed dark-energy density. The slow renormalization of $\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}$ implies a mild time variation in $H_0$, providing a natural mitigation of the $H_0$ tension without exotic new fields.

        The residual potential energy of Γ-stiffness fluctuations in the vacuum provides a source for dark energy. This mapping identifies the microscopic Pirouette parameter with the macroscopic cosmological observation of accelerated expansion. It recasts Λ from a fundamental constant to an emergent, dynamic quantity.

        Γ-stiffness sets the fundamental scale for particle masses, analogous to the Higgs VEV. The calculated value Γ_stiff ≈ 250 GeV is numerically almost identical to the Higgs VEV (≈ 246 GeV), suggesting that Γ-stiffness may be the geometric origin of the electroweak scale.

        When modeled as a superfluid pressuron condensate, the residual Γ-stiffness field supports propagating modes. Its equation of state yields a predictable, sub-luminal sound speed, a key observable that distinguishes it from a true cosmological constant (for which $c_s^2=1$).

    Γ-Stiffness (Γ_stiff) is a scalar energy parameter of the time substrate. It should not be confused with the Christoffel symbols (Γ^a_bc) which describe the spacetime connection, the Lorentz factor (γ or Γ) of special relativity, or the mathematical Gamma function. The subscript "stiff" is used to avoid ambiguity.

# Γ-Stiffness

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The primary parameter, Γ_stiff, quantifying the time substrate's resistance to deformation. At high coherence, its value sets the scale for particle masses via the unified invariant $\mathfrak{M}^2$. In the low-coherence cosmological limit, its residual vacuum fluctuations, $\langle(\delta\Gamma)^2\rangle$, manifest as an effective cosmological constant, Λ_eff, driving cosmic acceleration.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory terms, Γ-Stiffness behaves like a scalar field parameter analogous to a vacuum expectation value (~250 GeV) that sources particle mass terms. Its residual quantum fluctuations in the vacuum contribute a potential energy density that is mathematically equivalent to the cosmological constant, Λ. This model predicts dark energy is not constant but a dynamic field with an equation of state $w \neq -1$ and a characteristic sub-luminal sound speed ($c_s \approx 0.58c$), offering testable deviations from the standard ΛCDM model.
