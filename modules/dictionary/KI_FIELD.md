    A primordial ripple on the substrate of time, whose self-interference weaves the tapestry of matter. It is the fundamental vibration from which observed reality crystallizes, the substance whose excitations we perceive as particles.
  law: |
    The propagation of a free Ki field excitation in the observer frame is governed by the Klein-Gordon equation. Its Feynman propagator is exactly `i / (p² - m_Ki² + iε)`, where the physical mass `m_Ki` is determined by both an intrinsic mass parameter and coupling to the background Γ-field.
  philosophy: |
    The Ki field embodies the principle that fundamental entities are fields, not points, defined over a pre-geometric time substrate. Its anisotropic substrate dynamics give rise to emergent Lorentz covariance, serving as the primary bridge between the substrate's fundamental structure and the observed relativistic world.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Ki field, `Ki(τ, u)`, is the Pirouette Framework's central complex scalar field, defined over the time substrate `M_τ`. Its dynamics are governed by a substrate Lagrangian with distinct temporal stiffness `K_Ki` and spatial stiffness `Λ_Ki`. Through coordinate rescaling (`t = sqrt(K_Ki)τ`, `x = sqrt(Λ_Ki)u`), these anisotropic dynamics yield the standard, Lorentz-covariant Klein-Gordon equation in the observer frame. It couples to U(1) gauge fields via minimal coupling, possesses a `λ|Ki|^4` self-interaction, and interacts with the Γ-field, which contributes to its effective mass.

          Measure the differential cross-sections of particle interactions mediated by Ki quanta (e.g., scalar Bhabha scattering analog). Fit the energy and angular dependence of these cross-sections to the theoretical predictions derived from the Feynman rules in MATH-027. This allows inference of the propagator's form and vertex factors, thereby constraining `m_Ki`, `e`, and `λ_Ki`.

# Ki Field

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Ki field, `Ki(τ, u)`, is the Pirouette Framework's central complex scalar field, defined over the time substrate `M_τ`. Its dynamics are governed by a substrate Lagrangian with distinct temporal stiffness `K_Ki` and spatial stiffness `Λ_Ki`. Through coordinate rescaling (`t = sqrt(K_Ki)τ`, `x = sqrt(Λ_Ki)u`), these anisotropic dynamics yield the standard, Lorentz-covariant Klein-Gordon equation in the observer frame. It couples to U(1) gauge fields via minimal coupling, possesses a `λ|Ki|^4` self-interaction, and interacts with the Γ-field, which contributes to its effective mass.

## EFT-First Summary
In the effective field theory (EFT) limit, the Ki Field is operationally indistinguishable from a standard complex scalar field, as described in canonical quantum field theory textbooks (e.g., Peskin & Schroeder, *An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*). It describes a spin-0 boson with mass `m_Ki`, electric charge `e`, and a `λ|Ki|^4` self-interaction. Its primary distinction within the Pirouette framework is its origin as an excitation of a field defined on a more fundamental, anisotropic 'time substrate', from which Lorentz invariance emerges as a low-energy symmetry.
