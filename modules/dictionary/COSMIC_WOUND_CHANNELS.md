        Structural Filaments (Cosmic Wound Channels): The primary scars, corresponding to the vast walls and filaments of the cosmic web. As established in CORE-011, these are reinforced channels where the path of maximal coherence has been deepened over eons, guiding the flow of matter and light like riverbeds carved into the fabric of spacetime.

    The universe is a scarred old stone, its history written not in smooth places but in the magnificent, deep channels carved by primordial events. These are the riverbeds of spacetime, guiding the flow of creation along the memory of ancient traumas.
  law: |
    Cosmic Wound Channels are persistent, large-scale filamentary structures identified on a Coherence Residual Map where the residual `Œîùìõ_p = ùìõ_p(observed) - ùìõ_p(model)` exceeds a statistical significance threshold (typically > 5œÉ) and exhibits topological properties consistent with a one-dimensional manifold.
  philosophy: |
    These channels reframe cosmological structures not as incidental gravitational clumps, but as the universe's memory made manifest. They are the pathways of least resistance for cosmic evolution, enforced by the historical weight of foundational events, proving that the past is an active geometric agent in the present.
pirouette_definition: |
  The primary geometric scars on the Cosmic Coherence Manifold, identified as filamentary regions of high-magnitude Coherence Residual (`Œîùìõ_p`). These channels correspond to the large-scale structure of the cosmic web (filaments and walls) and represent reinforced pathways of maximal coherence, deepened over cosmic time by foundational events. They function as a persistent historical term `V_scar(x)` in the effective Lagrangian, guiding the flow of matter and energy.

          1. Generate the *Null Canvas* (`ùìõ_p(model)`) by solving the Pirouette Lagrangian for a smooth, homogenous, isotropic cosmology.
          2. Translate observational data (CMB, galaxy surveys) into the *Cosmic Palimpsest* (`ùìõ_p(observed)`) using the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014).
          3. Calculate the Coherence Residual Map: `Œîùìõ_p = ùìõ_p(observed) - ùìõ_p(model)`.
          4. Identify and classify filamentary structures on the map that exceed a statistical threshold as Cosmic Wound Channels.

    excerpt: |
      The Coherence Residual Map (`Œîùìõ_p`) is therefore our direct measurement of this historical term: `Œîùìõ_p ‚âà -V_scar(x)`. By mapping the residuals, we are mapping the geometry and intensity of the universe's memory, reconstructing the shape of the primordial events that created the landscape we inhabit.

        The `V_scar(x)` term acts as a persistent modification to the Lagrangian based on historical events. This is mathematically analogous to non-local or history-dependent terms in the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure, which integrate over the past evolution of the system to determine present-day dynamics.

# Cosmic Wound Channels

The primary geometric scars on the manifold, corresponding to the cosmic web's filaments and walls.

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The primary geometric scars on the Cosmic Coherence Manifold, identified as filamentary regions of high-magnitude Coherence Residual (`Œîùìõ_p`). These channels correspond to the large-scale structure of the cosmic web (filaments and walls) and represent reinforced pathways of maximal coherence, deepened over cosmic time by foundational events. They function as a persistent historical term `V_scar(x)` in the effective Lagrangian, guiding the flow of matter and energy.

## EFT-First Summary
In standard cosmology, Cosmic Wound Channels correspond to the filaments and walls of the cosmic web‚Äîthe large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. While typically modeled as the result of gravitational collapse from primordial density fluctuations, the Pirouette Framework posits an additional layer of explanation: these structures are persistent geometric 'scars' (`V_scar`) that actively guide matter accretion, representing a form of cosmic memory. This concept may be formally related to non-local or history-dependent terms in the Effective Field Theory of LSS.
