        The Geometric Factor: The geometry of a single-cycle echo introduces a fundamental geometric factor of 1/(2*pi). This is not a "fudge factor" but a direct consequence of integrating the interaction over a single cycle of the echo's phase.

  art: |
    The echo of a particle's dance with itself, when traced through a full turn of its phase, leaves behind not a perfect circle, but a gap. This factor is the measure of that inevitable imperfection, the geometric cost of self-awareness.
  law: |
    The first-order correction to a particle's magnetic moment from its self-interaction via a coherence echo is `a_e = α * G_φ`, where `G_φ = 1/(2π)`. This value is a non-negotiable consequence of the topology of a single-cycle phase integration.
  philosophy: |
    This factor demonstrates that fundamental constants can emerge directly from geometric necessities rather than being arbitrary parameters. It grounds abstract topological features in concrete, measurable physical effects, serving as a primary bridge from the framework's mathematics to testable physics.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Geometric Factor is a dimensionless constant, `1/(2π)`, that emerges from the integration of a self-interaction over a single, complete cycle of a resonance's phase echo. It represents the intrinsic geometric scaling of a first-order correction due to the topology of the interaction path on the coherence manifold. It is not an adjustable parameter but a fundamental consequence of cyclical phase geometry.

        outline: |
          The factor is a theoretical primitive and is not measured directly. Its value is validated by measuring the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (`a_e`) and the fine-structure constant (`α`) independently, then confirming that the experimental ratio `a_e / α` converges to `1/(2π)`.

    excerpt: |
      The Geometric Factor: The geometry of a single-cycle echo introduces a fundamental geometric factor of 1/(2*pi). This is not a "fudge factor" but a direct consequence of integrating the interaction over a single cycle of the echo's phase. The Result: The first-order correction to the magnetic moment, a_e, is therefore the product of the interaction strength and the geometric factor: a_e = alpha / (2*pi).
  - module: MATH-010
    excerpt: |
      Using the established value for alpha (approx 1/137.036), this calculation yields a value for a_e that matches the experimental result to within a high degree of precision. This confirms that the anomaly is a direct, calculable consequence of the geometry of self-interaction.

      justification: |
        The Pirouette framework derives the first-order correction to the electron's anomalous magnetic moment as the product `α * G_φ`. The result, `α/(2π)`, is mathematically identical to the one-loop QED correction first calculated by Schwinger. The Pirouette model provides a geometric interpretation for this famous numerical factor.

    - target: Schwinger factor `α/(2π)`
      rationale: The mathematical form, numerical value, and physical context (first-order correction to electron g-2) are identical. The Pirouette framework offers a new geometric derivation for a cornerstone result of QED.

    - statement: "The geometric factor `G_φ` is a universal constant with the exact value `1/(2π)` for any first-order self-interaction mediated by a single-cycle coherence echo."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "If higher-precision measurements of `a_e` and `α` show that the first-order term is not `α/(2π)`, or if another physical system governed by a coherence echo shows a different first-order geometric factor."

naming_notes:
  collisions: ["`γ` (gamma) is often used for geometric factors but is overloaded (photons, Lorentz factor). `G` is also common (Gravitational constant). The subscript `φ` (phi) is added to specify its origin in phase integration."]
  disambiguation: |
    This factor should not be confused with solid angles or other geometric terms in scattering theory. It arises specifically from path integration over a phase cycle, not a spatial angle. Its value is fixed at `1/(2π)` and is not context-dependent.
