    The universe does not forget; every conflict is a verdict carved into its flesh, a scar that becomes a map for all who follow. History is not a story told, but a landscape shaped by bygone pressures.
  law: |
    The net information dissipated during a Resonant Test induces a persistent, non-local modification to the local coherence potential (`V_Γ`). This modification, a Wound Channel, functions as a new boundary condition, altering the action for all subsequent dynamics within its causal influence.
  philosophy: |
    This principle establishes history as a physically potent and binding force. It reframes conflict not as an anomaly or failure, but as the primary mechanism through which the universe learns, adapts, and writes new laws, turning transient events into permanent, heritable structure.
pirouette_definition: |
  The principle that the outcome of a Resonant Test—a duel between two coherence patterns—is permanently inscribed upon the local spacetime manifold as a `Wound Channel`. This "scar" is not mere damage; it is a physical precedent, a "verdict" that alters the local potential landscape (`V_Γ`). It modifies the path integrals for subsequent events, making certain dynamic pathways more or less costly, thereby ensuring that the past has a direct, physical, and lawful influence on the future.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless scaling factor on `V_Γ`, or Joules/meter⁴ (as a change in potential energy density).

    - name: ΔV_scar
      meaning: Change in the local coherence potential due to a Wound Channel.

        outline: |
          1.  Map the baseline coherence potential `V_Γ` of a spacetime region using a grid of non-invasive probe systems.
          2.  Induce or observe a high-intensity Resonant Test within the region.
          3.  After the event has resolved, re-map the coherence potential.
          4.  The Jurisprudence of Scars is quantified by the persistent, localized change (ΔV_scar) in the potential landscape that does not decay with background dissipation rates.
        expected_signals: [Persistent anisotropy in probe path deviations, localized spikes in Coherence Degradation along the Wound Channel boundary.]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing a true scar from ambient manifold fluctuations, signal decoherence over long timescales, insufficient probe sensitivity.]

    excerpt: |
      Regardless of the outcome, the event itself—the clash, the test, the resolution—is carved into the geometry of spacetime as a new, complex `Wound Channel` (CORE-011). This scar is a precedent. It alters the landscape of coherence for all future entities, making one path more likely and another more costly. The duel writes its verdict into the laws of the local universe.

    excerpt: |
      Conflict, when seen through this lens, becomes the universe's most necessary act of clarification. For the edge of the self is only ever found where it meets the edge of another, and it is in that fierce and necessary dance that an echo is tempered into a song that endures.

        The principle describes a system whose present state and response to stimuli are dependent on its history. A high-energy event (the duel) permanently alters the system's energy landscape, a defining characteristic of hysteresis where the path taken matters.

      justification: |
        A Wound Channel acts as a persistent, localized structure in the spacetime manifold with a distinct energy density that influences surrounding geodesics/paths. This is operationally similar to topological defects like cosmic strings or domain walls, which are remnants of past phase transitions.

  adopted:
    - target: Hysteresis
      rationale: The core concept is path-dependence and memory of past stress, which is the essential definition of hysteresis. While "Topological Defect" describes the physical object (the scar), "Hysteresis" better captures the lawful principle (the jurisprudence).

    "Jurisprudence" is used here to denote a binding, precedent-setting *physical effect*, not a metaphorical or conscious legal system. The "verdict" of a duel is not deliberated; it is an unavoidable physical consequence of information loss and pattern reformation, which then constrains future dynamics as if it were a new law.

# Jurisprudence of Scars

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The principle that the outcome of a Resonant Test—a duel between two coherence patterns—is permanently inscribed upon the local spacetime manifold as a `Wound Channel`. This "scar" is not mere damage; it is a physical precedent, a "verdict" that alters the local potential landscape (`V_Γ`). It modifies the path integrals for subsequent events, making certain dynamic pathways more or less costly, thereby ensuring that the past has a direct, physical, and lawful influence on the future.

## EFT-First Summary
The Jurisprudence of Scars describes a physical memory effect analogous to **hysteresis** in condensed matter systems. A high-energy interaction ("duel") between two systems permanently alters the local vacuum potential. This alteration, a "scar," means the system's future response to stimuli is dependent on this past event, creating a non-reversible, path-dependent evolution for the local laws of physics.
