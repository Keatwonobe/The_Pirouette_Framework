        With the system's `Ki` mapped over time, the Sentinel calculates its rate of change. This produces the **Manifold Drift Vector (V_drift)**, a direct measurement of the velocity and direction of the system's changing resonant identity.

  art: |
    The palpable skid or wobble of a system losing its footing on the path of coherence. It is the tremor in a system's song, the first audible sign of a faltering rhythm before the structure breaks.
  law: |
    The Manifold Drift Vector is the time derivative of a system's resonant identity (`Ki`) within its coherence manifold, `V_drift = d(Ki)/dt`. A non-zero `V_drift` indicates a departure from the system's geodesic, signaling an accumulation of Lagrangian Stress.
  philosophy: |
    This vector makes the abstract concept of "losing coherence" a measurable, predictive quantity. It objectifies the pre-symptomatic phase of instability, transforming foresight from an intuition into a diagnostic measurement.
pirouette_definition: |
  A vector quantity representing the rate and direction of change of a system's resonant identity (`Ki`) on its coherence manifold. It is the primary indicator of a system's departure from its geodesic path of maximal coherence, serving as a direct precursor to a potential state transition. Its magnitude is a raw measure of systemic instability.
operational_definition:
  units: `[Ki] · T⁻¹`. Context-dependent based on the chosen basis for `Ki`. If `Ki` is a vector of dimensionless harmonic amplitudes, units are `s⁻¹`.

        outline: |
          1. Ingest multiple, synchronous time-series data streams from a target system.
          2. Use signal processing (e.g., Fourier, wavelet, or modal analysis) to extract the system's dominant resonant signature (`Ki`) at sequential time steps `t_i`.
          3. Numerically differentiate the time-series of `Ki(t)` to compute the vector `V_drift ≈ (Ki(t_i) - Ki(t_{i-1})) / (t_i - t_{i-1})`.
          This vector's magnitude and direction quantify the system's instability.
        expected_signals: [time-series data (vibrational, network, economic, etc.)]
        pitfalls: [Signal-to-noise ratio is too low, aliasing artifacts, incorrect choice of basis for representing Ki, insufficient time resolution.]

    excerpt: |
      Instability begins as a waver. As internal or external pressures mount, the system struggles to maintain this geodesic. The first symptom is **Temporal Jitter (Jτ)**: a micro-variation in the system's once-steady rhythm... This jitter is the root cause of **Manifold Drift**: the observable "skidding" of the system's `Ki` pattern on the coherence manifold.

    excerpt: |
      With the system's `Ki` mapped over time, the Sentinel calculates its rate of change. This produces the **Manifold Drift Vector (V_drift)**, a direct measurement of the velocity and direction of the system's changing resonant identity. This vector is the quantitative measure of the "wobble"—the tangible signal of underlying instability.

      justification: |
        In the context of a stochastic differential equation (SDE), the drift term `μ` represents the deterministic component of the system's evolution. `V_drift` serves as a direct measurement of this term for the state variable `Ki`, isolating the systematic pull away from a stable point from random fluctuations.

  adopted:
    - target: Drift term `μ(x, t)` in SDE/Fokker-Planck formalism
      rationale: The mapping is operationally and conceptually direct. `V_drift` quantifies the deterministic "force" causing the system's probability distribution to shift, which is precisely the role of the drift term.

  claims:
    - statement: "A sustained, non-zero `V_drift` precedes all non-instantaneous Ki Morphogenesis events in a system."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "The discovery of a class of systemic bifurcations that occur from a state of `V_drift` = 0, indicating a tipping-point phenomenon without measurable precursors detectable by this method."

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike the drift velocity of particles in a physical medium (e.g., electrons in a conductor), the Manifold Drift Vector describes the velocity of a system's *abstract identity* (`Ki`) within a high-dimensional state space (the coherence manifold), not motion in physical space.
