    A field's echo, shaping its own arena. The pressure turns inward, a gladiator forging its own constraints until its chaotic struggle finds a stable, non-trivial form.
  law: |
    The leading nonlinear self-interaction term in the effective pressure, ℒ_G = -(κ_G/4!) Γ⁴, whose coupling κ_G runs under RG flow toward a non-trivial infrared fixed point. The exponent is fixed at 4 by symmetry constraints (MATH-018 D2); any other value is inadmissible.
  philosophy: |
    Gladiator feedback replaces post-hoc calibration with predictive, symmetry-derived structure. It ensures system stability and complex behavior arise from first principles (RG flow on a constrained potential) rather than from arbitrary functional choices, embodying the framework's commitment to falsifiability over fine-tuning.
pirouette_definition: |
  The leading-order, nonlinear self-coupling term of the effective pressure field Γ, denoted ℒ_G. Its functional form is not chosen ad-hoc but is fixed by the symmetry principles of locality, analyticity, and scale covariance (MATH-018 D2) to be quartic in Γ. Its coupling strength, κ_G, is not a fixed parameter but evolves with energy scale K according to a Renormalization Group (RG) flow, typically studied on the (Γ,K)-space. This term is essential for describing non-perturbative back-reaction effects and is expected to flow to a non-trivial fixed point in the infrared, governing the system's long-range stability.

          Infer the running coupling κ_G(K) by analyzing deviations from linear predictions in observables sensitive to back-reaction (e.g., lepton g−2 portal corrections, soliton echo profiles). The RG beta function for κ_G is constrained by fitting its predictions to multiple observables measured at different energy scales, with the overall model scale set by a single one-shot anchor (MATH-018 D3).

        This is a standard renormalizable self-interaction for a scalar field in 4D. The description of Gladiator feedback as the leading nonlinear self-coupling term, constrained by an even-power expansion requirement (MATH-018 D2), maps directly to the role of the quartic term in theories with a Z₂ symmetry (φ → -φ). The analysis via RG flow is the standard method for studying such terms.

    Distinguish from linear pressure terms or external potentials. Gladiator feedback is an *intrinsic*, *nonlinear* self-interaction of the Γ field, representing the system regulating its own dynamics through back-reaction. The "Gladiator" metaphor highlights this internal struggle toward a stable state.

# Gladiator feedback

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The leading-order, nonlinear self-coupling term of the effective pressure field Γ, denoted ℒ_G. Its functional form is not chosen ad-hoc but is fixed by the symmetry principles of locality, analyticity, and scale covariance (MATH-018 D2) to be quartic in Γ. Its coupling strength, κ_G, is not a fixed parameter but evolves with energy scale K according to a Renormalization Group (RG) flow, typically studied on the (Γ,K)-space. This term is essential for describing non-perturbative back-reaction effects and is expected to flow to a non-trivial fixed point in the infrared, governing the system's long-range stability.

## EFT-First Summary
Gladiator feedback is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to a `λφ⁴` self-interaction term for a scalar field in Quantum Field Theory. Its dynamics are governed by the Renormalization Group, which describes how the coupling strength `κ_G` (analogous to `λ`) changes with energy scale. A core claim of the framework is that this coupling flows to a non-trivial fixed point, indicating a persistent, scale-invariant interaction strength at low energies, which is critical for describing non-perturbative phenomena.
