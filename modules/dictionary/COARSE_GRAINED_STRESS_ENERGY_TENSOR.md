        By construction, the **coarse-grained stress–energy** is the metric variation of the matter part of (S_{\text{eff}}):
        [ \langle T_{\mu\nu} \rangle = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}},\frac{\delta S_{\text{eff}}^{,\text{matter}}}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} , \qquad \nabla^\mu \langle T_{\mu\nu} \rangle = 0. ]

    The coarse-grained stress-energy tensor ⟨T_μν⟩ is the functional derivative of the macroscopic matter action S_eff with respect to the inverse metric g^μν. It is the source term in the emergent Einstein Field Equations G_μν + Λg_μν = 8πG⟨T_μν⟩, and its covariant divergence is identically zero as a consequence of the Bianchi identities.
  philosophy: |
    This tensor embodies the principle of emergence, showing how the complex, high-frequency dynamics of fundamental fields give rise to the simple, large-scale structures we perceive as matter and energy. It is the formal interface between the Pirouette Framework's microscopic 'why' (coherence dynamics) and General Relativity's macroscopic 'how' (spacetime curvature).
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coarse-Grained Stress-Energy Tensor, ⟨T_μν⟩, is the macroscopic quantity that sources spacetime curvature in the Pirouette Framework. It is derived by a coarse-graining procedure—averaging over a mesoscopic length scale L—applied to the microscopic stress-energy tensor T_μν of the Coherence (C) and Temporal Pressure (Γ) fields. Operationally, ⟨T_μν⟩ is defined as the variation of the matter part of the effective action, S_eff, with respect to the spacetime metric. Its conservation, ∇^μ⟨T_μν⟩ = 0, is a direct consequence of diffeomorphism invariance and the Bianchi identity.

# Coarse-Grained Stress-Energy Tensor

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Coarse-Grained Stress-Energy Tensor, ⟨T_μν⟩, is the macroscopic quantity that sources spacetime curvature in the Pirouette Framework. It is derived by a coarse-graining procedure—averaging over a mesoscopic length scale L—applied to the microscopic stress-energy tensor T_μν of the Coherence (C) and Temporal Pressure (Γ) fields. Operationally, ⟨T_μν⟩ is defined as the variation of the matter part of the effective action, S_eff, with respect to the spacetime metric. Its conservation, ∇^μ⟨T_μν⟩ = 0, is a direct consequence of diffeomorphism invariance and the Bianchi identity.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Coarse-Grained Stress-Energy Tensor ⟨T_μν⟩ is identical to the stress-energy tensor used in General Relativity (GR) and effective field theories (EFTs) of gravity. It sources the Einstein tensor as in G_μν = 8πG T_μν. The Pirouette Framework provides a specific microscopic origin for this tensor from two fundamental scalar fields, C and Γ, analogous to how an EFT of pions describes the low-energy limit of QCD.
