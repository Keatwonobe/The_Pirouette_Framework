    A piece of pre-calculated wisdom, transcribing the grand music of the Lagrangian into a song one can hum by heart in a storm. It is the mastery of a reliable compass when the perfect map is unavailable or obsolete.
  law: |
    If a system's state matches the `Trigger Condition`, the `Prescribed Action` is executed. The resulting deviation from the perfect geodesic will not exceed the pre-calculated `Coherence Bound`.
  philosophy: |
    To trade the paralysis of perfect, late analysis for the grace of a timely, good-enough action. It operationalizes the Lagrangian by providing principled, computationally inexpensive shortcuts for real-world navigation under pressure.

  A computationally lightweight, codified heuristic distilled from the Pirouette Lagrangian. It comprises three formal components: a `Trigger Condition` (a specific system state pattern, often involving Coherence Kτ and Temporal Pressure Γ), a `Prescribed Action` (a simple, low-cost directive), and a `Coherence Bound` (the pre-calculated maximum potential coherence loss incurred by using the heuristic).

        outline: |
          1. **Map Terrain:** Translate domain features into framework variables (Kτ, Γ) via Fractal Scaling (`CORE-014`).
          2. **Sensitivity Analysis:** Identify critical points (regions of high/low sensitivity) on the coherence manifold.
          3. **Forge Rule:** Define a simple trigger/action pair that steers the system toward stable channels and away from "cliffs" of coherence loss.
          4. **Calibrate Fidelity:** Calculate the maximum potential coherence loss from using the template versus a full Lagrangian analysis to define the Coherence Bound.
        expected_signals: [A repeatable correlation between trigger conditions and coherence-stabilizing outcomes of the prescribed action, a bounded and non-catastrophic error term.]
        pitfalls: [Overfitting the heuristic to a narrow training domain, mis-calibrating the Coherence Bound leading to cascading failure, creating triggers that are too computationally expensive to evaluate quickly.]

      A heuristic is not a guess; it is a principled simplification, a piece of pre-calculated wisdom. Each "Geodesic Template" is forged through a four-step protocol that translates the universal dynamics of the framework into the specific language of a domain. It must reduce complexity, steering the Weaver toward the currents and away from the cliffs.

        Both are pre-computed structures derived from a complex dynamical model to enable fast, real-time decision-making. The template's `Trigger` acts as the lookup key (a binned region of the state space), and the `Prescribed Action` is the corresponding stored control output. The `Coherence Bound` quantifies the performance degradation versus an optimal, but slow, online calculation.

    A Geodesic Template is not an arbitrary guess or a folk "rule of thumb". It is a formally derived heuristic forged from the Pirouette Lagrangian through a rigorous distillation protocol, and it must include a quantified risk assessment via its Coherence Bound.

# Geodesic Template

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A computationally lightweight, codified heuristic distilled from the Pirouette Lagrangian. It comprises three formal components: a `Trigger Condition` (a specific system state pattern, often involving Coherence Kτ and Temporal Pressure Γ), a `Prescribed Action` (a simple, low-cost directive), and a `Coherence Bound` (the pre-calculated maximum potential coherence loss incurred by using the heuristic).

## EFT-First Summary
In control theory, a Geodesic Template is analogous to a pre-computed control policy, like a lookup table, derived from a complete dynamical model (the Lagrangian). It maps a specific region of the system's state space (the trigger) to a computationally cheap action, accepting a known performance trade-off (the Coherence Bound) to achieve real-time response. It is a form of model simplification for rapid, "good enough" execution.
