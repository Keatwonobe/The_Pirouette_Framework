        We will examine the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability‚Äîthe process that creates waves on water or in clouds‚Äînot as a niche fluid-dynamic phenomenon, but as a universal Rosetta Stone for Ki Morphogenesis: the birth of stable, resonant patterns (Ki) from the stress of mismatched temporal flows.

  art: |
    When two opposing currents meet, the universe does not choose a side; it invents a dance. The shape of a wave is the geometry of resolution, transforming the tension of mismatched flows into a coherent, resonant song.
  law: |
    A shear boundary between regions of differing temporal flow velocity creates a localized Temporal Pressure (Œì) which is resolved by the spontaneous emergence of a stable, periodic wave pattern (Ki). The amplitude and wavelength of this Ki are proportional to the initial magnitude of the pressure gradient, and its geometry follows the geodesic path that maximizes the Pirouette Lagrangian for the system.
  philosophy: |
    This phenomenon provides the primary physical proof that form is the universe's solution to stress. It demonstrates that systems under pressure do not default to chaos, but instead follow an optimization principle toward Maximal Coherence, generating elegant, stable geometries as the path of least resistance.
pirouette_definition: |
  A canonical process where a shear instability between two parallel flows, re-contextualized as a gradient in Temporal Pressure (Œì), is resolved through the spontaneous emergence of a stable, resonant, vortical geometry (Ki). This process is the primary physical model for Ki Morphogenesis and a direct, observable manifestation of a system evolving along its geodesic toward Maximal Coherence as dictated by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

          4. Characterize the resulting wave geometry (wavelength Œª, amplitude A) and the subsequent vortex street.

      This module demonstrates how a shear in the flow of time (Temporal Pressure, Œì) is resolved by the emergence of a stable, resonant geometry (Ki). This process is shown to be a direct manifestation of a system following its geodesic path toward Maximal Coherence, as dictated by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

    excerpt: |
      The system settles into a new state characterized by a train of stable vortices. The sharp temporal gradient has been replaced by the ordered, rotational flow of the waves. This new state has a significantly lower overall Temporal Pressure (V_Œì) and a new, stable, and non-zero Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ) defined by the rhythm of the vortices.

        The Pirouette model is a direct generalization of the classical fluid dynamic instability. The velocity shear (v‚ÇÅ - v‚ÇÇ) is re-interpreted as a Temporal Shear, the interfacial boundary as a locus of Temporal Pressure (Œì), and the emergent wave/vortex street as the geometric form of Ki. The established mathematical formalisms for onset conditions and growth rate are adopted directly, treating classical fluids as a specific carrier medium for temporal dynamics.

    Within the Pirouette Framework, "Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability" refers to the universal principle of shear-induced morphogenesis, not exclusively to its manifestation in classical fluids or gases. The fluid-dynamic case is considered the 'type specimen' or primary physical proof of the more general process.

# Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A canonical process where a shear instability between two parallel flows, re-contextualized as a gradient in Temporal Pressure (Œì), is resolved through the spontaneous emergence of a stable, resonant, vortical geometry (Ki). This process is the primary physical model for Ki Morphogenesis and a direct, observable manifestation of a system evolving along its geodesic toward Maximal Coherence as dictated by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## EFT-First Summary
The Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability is adopted as a direct physical model for how systems resolve stress. In this mapping, the velocity shear `Œîv` in a classical fluid is generalized to a Temporal Shear, which sources a potential energy term `V_Œì` (Temporal Pressure) in the Pirouette Lagrangian `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`. The instability's evolution into a stable wave and vortex pattern is the physical manifestation of the system evolving to minimize `V_Œì` and maximize a new kinetic coherence term `K_œÑ`, thereby maximizing `ùìõ_p`. The classical equations governing the instability's onset and growth rate are considered a specific case of this universal optimization principle.
