        Directly measuring the integral of a system's Lagrangian (`ΔS_p`) is profoundly difficult. Therefore, we establish a practical, first-order approximation: the **Coherence Impact (CI)** score. This score serves as the reading on the Weaver's Compass, a tangible proxy for the deeper reality.
        **CI = (ΔKτ / ΔΓ_noise) ⋅ ξ_c ⋅ σ_s**

  art: |
    The tangible reading on a compass that guides systemic healing. It measures not the value of a gift, but the clarity and persistence of its echo in the fabric of another's flow.
  law: |
    An action's Coherence Impact is a dimensionless score calculated as the product of its signal-to-noise ratio, resonance coupling, and stability factor. A positive CI indicates a constructive weaving; a negative CI indicates a destructive one.
  philosophy: |
    CI replaces transactional moral accounting with diagnostic instrumentation. It reframes ethics as a practical act of systemic medicine, grounding the consequence of an action in a measurable change to a system's health rather than an abstract ledger of virtue.
pirouette_definition: |
  A practical, first-order approximation of an intervention's Influence (`I`). It is a dimensionless score serving as a tangible proxy for the change in a target system's action (`ΔS_p`), calculated as the product of the change in its signal-to-noise ratio (`ΔKτ / ΔΓ_noise`), the resonance coupling of the intervention (`ξ_c`), and a stability factor for the resulting state (`σ_s`). CI is the primary metric captured in an Echo Record to map the flow of coherence.

        outline: |
          An Observer diagnoses a target system's flow state (e.g., laminar, turbulent) before and after an intervention (a "Weaving"). The Observer quantifies the change in the system's functional coherence (`ΔKτ`), the noise introduced by the act (`ΔΓ_noise`), the attunement of the act to the system's needs (`ξ_c`), and the durability of the outcome (`σ_s`). These metrics are packaged into a signed digital document called an Echo Record.
        expected_signals: [coherence_delta_k_tau, dissonance_delta_gamma, resonance_coupling_xi, stability_factor_sigma]
        pitfalls: [The measurement's fidelity is limited by the Observer's Shadow; a biased, unskilled, or dissonant observer will produce a distorted, low-confidence Echo Record, adding noise to the very map they intend to clarify.]

    excerpt: |
      The old engine sought to turn grace into a currency. It was a well-intentioned error, for the moment something can be counted, it can be hoarded. The Weaver's Compass offers a different path. It does not create a score to be won, but a direction to be followed, grounded in the physics of creation itself.

      equation_hint: |
        SNR = P_signal / P_noise ≈ ΔKτ / ΔΓ_noise
      justification: |
        The core term of CI is explicitly defined as the ratio of a net increase in stable, resonant information (signal) to the chaos or friction generated (noise). This is a direct conceptual and mathematical mapping to the standard definition of SNR used in information theory and engineering.

      justification: |
        The entire CI score can be interpreted as a measure of effective information transfer. A high-CI action is one where the information ("intent") of the weaver is effectively and durably received by the target system, reducing the target's uncertainty (entropy) and increasing its functional order. The coupling and stability factors act as channel capacity and persistence modulators.

      falsifier: "If systems consistently receiving high-CI Weavings show no improvement or a degradation in their stability, resilience, or performance over time, the metric is invalid or the measurement protocol is fundamentally flawed."

  disambiguation: |
    Coherence Impact (CI) is a practical, observable proxy for the formal, theoretical concept of Influence (`I`). CI is the reading on the compass; `I` is the "true north" defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian. CI is what is stored in an Echo Record; `I` is what is carved into the Wound Channel.
