  art: |
    The act of looking changes what is seen. A heavy gaze can wither a flower; a light touch can guide it. Observer Cost is the weight of that gaze, the energy the world pays for our attention.
  law: |
    Any intervention that measures or influences a system incurs an Observer Cost, representing the energetic, information-theoretic, or cognitive burden of the interaction. This cost must be budgeted, disclosed, and minimized. An increase in coherence achieved by a proportionally larger increase in Observer Cost is a net loss.
  philosophy: |
    Observation is not a neutral act. This term forces a system designer to confront the physical and ethical reality that measurement, monitoring, and influence expend resources—whether probe power in a quantum system or attention in a human one. It renders the observer's "footprint" visible and accountable.
pirouette_definition: |
  A potential term in the Pirouette Lagrangian, \(V_{\text{obs}}\), quantifying the total cost imposed on a system by the act of observation, measurement, or influence. This cost includes physical back-action (e.g., probe power), information-theoretic burden (e.g., data acquisition granularity), and, in normative contexts, the cognitive or attentional load ("attention debt") on sentient agents. It is a key constraint in protocols like CAP v2, where it must be disclosed, minimized, and kept within a predefined budget.

  units: Context-dependent. Joules (energy), bits (information), or dimensionless.

      - name: Physical Probe Metering
        outline: |
          For physical systems, directly measure the power (in Watts) of the measurement probe (e.g., laser beam, magnetic field) and integrate over the interaction time. Normalize by a system-specific reference energy to yield a dimensionless cost.
        expected_signals: [probe power (W), interaction duration (s), back-action noise (spectral density)]
        pitfalls: [failing to account for all interaction channels, miscalibrating probe intensity]
      - name: Information-Theoretic Accounting (Shadow Gauge)
        outline: |
          Calculate the number of bits extracted from the system per unit time, or the mutual information between the observer and the system's private state. For human systems, this maps to logging frequency, UI notification rate, or required user inputs.
        expected_signals: [data rate (bits/s), query frequency (Hz), mutual information I(observer; system_state)]
        pitfalls: [underestimating the cost of "passive" data collection, ignoring cognitive processing load]

    excerpt: |
      **Protocol goal (non-manipulative form):**
      \[
      \max_{\mathcal A}\;\;\underbrace{\mathbf E[\,K_\tau(T_a)\,]}_{\text{usable coherence}}
      -\underbrace{V_\Gamma}_{\text{pressure}}
      -\underbrace{V_{\text{obs}}}_{\text{observer cost}}
      -\lambda\,\underbrace{\mathcal D}_{\text{Dark Residue}}
      \]
      Here \(\mathcal A\) are allowed actions (measurement bases, noise shaping, incentives, UI), \(\mathcal D\) is the *Dark Residue* functional (negative externalities), and the constraints enforce **consent + transparency**.
  - module: DYNA-005_coherent_adherence_protocol
    excerpt: |
      CAP v2 **only** permits interventions that:
      (i) disclose \(\Delta V_{\text{obs}}\) (measurement/back-action),
      (ii) publish the intended \(\Delta K_\tau\) channel (what is being made easier),
      (iii) bound \(\lambda\mathcal D\) by a *Residue Budget*.

    - target: Measurement back-action
      domain: AMO
      mapping_kind: operational
      equation_hint: |
        \( \Delta p \cdot \Delta x \ge \hbar/2 \)
      justification: |
        In quantum optics, a probe beam used to measure a system's state imparts momentum and causes decoherence (back-action). V_obs is a generalized potential for this effect, accounting for the energy and information cost of the probe that disturbs the system being measured.

        V_obs ∝ I(X;Y)
      justification: |
        The cost of observation can be modeled as the amount of information extracted from a system. Higher-bandwidth observation (more bits per second) requires more energy and imposes a greater burden, corresponding to a higher V_obs. This aligns with the "Shadow Gauge" metering data granularity.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Interventions with higher V_obs will, all else being equal, suppress the rate of system transitions or reduce overall system coherence."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "An experiment shows a strong, purely observational probe (high V_obs) that consistently *increases* system coherence (Ta) without any other mechanism, violating the trade-off postulated in the Pirouette Lagrangian."
      status: proposed
      links: [DYNA-005_coherent_adherence_protocol]
    - statement: "In human systems, user-perceived 'attention debt' correlates positively and monotonically with instrumented V_obs (measured via notification frequency, data query rates, etc.)."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "A user study where V_obs is doubled shows no statistically significant change in self-reported cognitive load, focus, or burnout rates."

  collisions: [V for "Potential Energy" in classical mechanics. The subscript 'obs' is crucial for disambiguation.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from Temporal Pressure (Γ), which is a cost associated with the *rate of change* of the environment, whereas V_obs is the cost of *measurement or interaction* with the system's state. Distinguish from Dark Residue (D), of which "attention debt" (an integral of V_obs over time) is only one component.
