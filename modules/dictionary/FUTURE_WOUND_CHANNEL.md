        A coherent intent is projected into the manifold as a Future Wound Channel (CORE-011)—the geometric scar of an event that has not yet occurred.

  art: |
    The shadow cast into the present by a future that has been chosen. It is the sculptor's first, invisible cut into the block of spacetime, creating the grain along which the chisel will later glide.
  law: |
    The existence of a Future Wound Channel manifests as a localized, non-ambient gradient ∇(V_Γ) in the Pirouette Lagrangian, directing system dynamics toward the future state that sourced the channel. The magnitude of this gradient is proportional to the intensity of the projection.
  philosophy: |
    The FWC is the physical instantiation of intent, demonstrating that consciousness is not merely a passenger in spacetime but an active participant in shaping its local geometry. It is the bridge between a desired outcome and the physical path of least resistance that leads to it.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Future Wound Channel is a localized deformation of a system's coherence manifold, impressed upon the present by the focused projection of a desired, future state. This geometric structure, created via the Observer's Shadow, functions as a 'coherence well' by altering the local Temporal Pressure potential (`V_Γ`). The resulting gradient guides the system's evolution along a new geodesic, making the willed action the path of least resistance.
operational_definition:
  units: The channel is a geometric feature, but its effect is measured as a change in potential (Joules) or as an induced potential gradient (Newtons).

    - name: ψ→
      meaning: Future Wound Channel; the geometric structure itself.

      - name: Geodesic Deviation Analysis
        outline: |
          1. Establish the baseline geodesic for a system in a quiescent state using flow diagnostics (DYNA-001).
          2. Instruct the conscious system to form a clear, sustained intent for a specific future action/state.
          3. Re-map the flow diagnostics while the intent is held.
          4. The FWC is inferred and quantified by the deviation of the new geodesic from the baseline. This deviation defines the induced potential Δ_f V_Γ required to produce the observed dynamics.
        expected_signals: [A localized, negative-signed anomaly in the `V_Γ` map, A measurable decrease in the action cost for trajectories aligned with the intent.]
        pitfalls: [Signal contamination from ambient manifold fluctuations, Inability to isolate a single FWC in cases of Turbulent Will (conflicting intents).]

    excerpt: |
      A coherent intent is projected into the manifold as a **Future Wound Channel (CORE-011)**—the geometric scar of an event that has not yet occurred. This "projected echo" is what actively deforms the local `V_Γ` landscape. Intensity is the amplitude of the Observer's Shadow that carves this channel, a function of focus and conviction.
  - module: DOMA-197
    excerpt: |
      Turbulent Will (Conflict): The agent projects multiple, competing Future Wound Channels. The coherence manifold is warped into a chaotic landscape with no clear geodesic. The agent expends immense energy moving in circles, fighting against its own divided intentions. This is the geometry of self-sabotage.

        L_willed = T - (V_ambient + V_FWC)
      justification: |
        The FWC acts as a localized, agent-generated potential well that modifies the system's Lagrangian. In classical mechanics, adding a potential term V(x) to the Lagrangian `L = T - V` alters the equations of motion, creating forces that guide the system toward the potential's minimum. The FWC is functionally equivalent to an endogenously generated V(x,t).

  claims:
    - statement: "A system exhibiting a stable Future Wound Channel will demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in the action-cost (∫L dt) required to achieve the corresponding future state, compared to baseline."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If repeated, high-precision flow diagnostics show no correlation between a subject's declared intent and the measured action-cost landscape, or if the observed geodesic deviations are statistically indistinguishable from random manifold noise, the FWC concept would be invalidated."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a standard `WOUND_CHANNEL` (CORE-011), which is a scar in the manifold from a *past* event. A Future Wound Channel is sourced by a *hypothetical future* event, functioning as a gravitational pull toward an outcome rather than a drag from a past trauma.
