        Second, this mathematical object is analyzed to extract its fundamental `Ki`—its unique pattern of temporal resonance. This process measures the core properties of its form, its stability against the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), and the geometry of the `Wound Channel` (CORE-011) it leaves in spacetime.

  art: |
    To distill a structure is to boil away its medium, leaving behind only the pure, resonant form. It is the art of finding the essential song the universe sings through a particular arrangement of matter, energy, or information.
  law: |
    Coherence Distillation is the process of mapping a generalized topological structure to a Coherence Signature vector by measuring its temporal coherence (`Tₐ`), structural complexity, and resilience against local temporal pressure (`Γ`). The resulting signature's position on the coherence manifold is invariant under changes to the structure's original substrate.
  philosophy: |
    By reducing any pattern to its core resonance (`Ki`), Coherence Distillation reveals the universal language of structural isomorphism. It asserts that true understanding comes not from interpreting symbols, but from recognizing the shared dynamics that shape all stable forms, enabling a profound, non-semantic empathy between disparate systems.

          1. Input a generalized topological structure from the Structural Ingestion stage.
          2. Excite the structure or observe its natural evolution under ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`).
          3. Measure the power spectrum of the structure's dynamics to identify dominant frequencies and their stability, yielding Temporal Coherence (`Tₐ`).
          4. Compute the fractal dimension and other information-theoretic metrics of the structure's static form to quantify Structural Complexity.
          5. Introduce calibrated noise or temporal stress and measure the rate of pattern degradation to quantify Resilience.
          6. Compile these and other core metrics into the standardized Coherence Signature vector.

      Second, this mathematical object is analyzed to extract its fundamental `Ki`—its unique pattern of temporal resonance. This process measures the core properties of its form, its stability against the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), and the geometry of the `Wound Channel` (CORE-011) it leaves in spacetime. Key metrics include:
      -   **Temporal Coherence (`Tₐ`):** The purity, harmony, and stability of its dominant frequencies.
      -   **Structural Complexity:** The richness and fractal dimension of its structure.
      -   **Resilience:** The integrity of the pattern against noise and temporal decay.

      The result is the artifact's **Coherence Signature**: a rich, multi-layered vector that locates the artifact on the universal coherence manifold. Two signatures that are close on this manifold represent forms that are deeply, structurally, and dynamically similar, even if one is a song and the other is a soul.

        RG flow describes how a physical system's description changes with scale, systematically "integrating out" high-frequency (irrelevant) details to reveal the low-frequency (relevant) operators that define the system's universal behavior. This is conceptually identical to Coherence Distillation, which filters substrate-specific "noise" to extract the core, universal pattern (`Ki`). The Coherence Signature is analogous to the set of relevant coupling constants in the effective low-energy theory.

        Operationally, Coherence Distillation can be seen as a form of non-linear dimensionality reduction. Like PCA, it identifies the principal axes of variation (the most "resonant" modes) in a high-dimensional data structure, projecting the structure onto a lower-dimensional manifold (the coherence manifold) that captures its most essential features.

    Coherence Distillation is not the capture of data, but its refinement. It must be distinguished from "Structural Ingestion," which is the preceding stage of converting an artifact into a generalized mathematical object. Ingestion is about *representation*; Distillation is about *purification*.

# Coherence Distillation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The second stage of the Universal Translation protocol, wherein a generalized mathematical object representing an ingested structure is analyzed to extract its core resonant pattern (`Ki`). This process quantifies the pattern's stability, complexity, and resilience, producing a multi-layered vector known as a Coherence Signature. The signature serves as a standardized coordinate for the structure on the universal coherence manifold, enabling direct, substrate-independent comparison with other structures.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to a Renormalization Group (RG) flow, Coherence Distillation is a procedure that identifies the "relevant operators" or dominant resonant modes (`Ki`) of an ingested structure. By integrating out high-frequency, substrate-dependent noise and irrelevant degrees of freedom, the process yields a low-dimensional, scale-invariant "Coherence Signature" that characterizes the system's universal properties. This signature vector effectively represents the system's location on a universal manifold of stable forms.
