        The process of DLA unfolds as a dialogue between this shoreline of order and the sea of chaos... The outermost tips of the shoreline‚Äîthe capes and peninsulas‚Äîproject furthest into the sea of chaos. They act as "temporal lightning rods," creating the most probable and efficient points for a new union...

    Growth is a song where each note, once played, becomes a permanent part of the instrument. The shape of a snowflake is the memory of a million resonant choices, a frozen record of a dance between chaos and coherence.
  law: |
    A system under high Temporal Pressure (Œì) grows by tracing a geodesic of maximal coherence, where each irreversible commitment reinforces a fractal structure (Ki) that is maximally receptive to future commitments. The structure's fractal dimension (D_∆í) measures this receptive efficiency.
  philosophy: |
    DLA is the archetypal model for how irreversible history physically shapes the present. It demonstrates that complex, resonant forms are not designed but emerge as the most efficient path for converting chaotic potential into stable structure, making physical form a memory of choice.
pirouette_definition: |
  The physical process of irreversible aggregation from a diffusing field, used as the primary model for growth as a geodesic. A DLA cluster is the physical history of sequential, irreversible temporal commitments that maximize the system's coherence. Its emergent dendritic structure is a resonant form (Ki) whose fractal dimension (D_∆í) measures its efficiency in converting the chaotic potential of Temporal Pressure (Œì) into stable, coherent form.

        outline: |
          1. Generate or acquire a 2D image of the DLA cluster.
          2. Overlay a grid of square boxes of side length Œµ.
          3. Count the number of boxes, N(Œµ), that contain at least one part of the cluster.
          4. Repeat for a range of decreasing box sizes Œµ.
          5. Plot log(N(Œµ)) vs. log(1/Œµ). The slope of the resulting line is the fractal dimension D_∆í.
        expected_signals: [A linear relationship on a log-log plot over a significant range of scales.]
        pitfalls: [Finite-size effects of the cluster can cause deviations at large and small Œµ. Insufficient particle count (N) leads to a poorly defined fractal regime.]

    excerpt: |
      The intricate, branching forms of snowflakes, lightning, and corals are not static designs. They are the physical memory of a system following a "growth geodesic," a path through spacetime that maximizes its temporal coherence. The old framework correctly identified these patterns with Ki; the new framework reveals they are the physical history of irreversible temporal commitments.
  - module: DOMA-103
    excerpt: |
      The formation of a DLA cluster is a direct physical manifestation of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = KœÑ - V_Œì). The system's evolution follows a growth geodesic‚Äîthe path that maximizes the action, S_p = ‚à´ ùìõ_p dt. The branching, fractal shape is the physical trace of this geodesic.

        N ~ R^(D_∆í) where N is particle count, R is radius, D_∆í is fractal dimension.
      justification: |
        The Pirouette model adopts the standard DLA algorithm operationally. It reinterprets the random walk of particles as a manifestation of high Temporal Pressure (Œì) and the resulting fractal cluster as the physical trace of a coherence-maximizing geodesic (Ki), rather than a purely stochastic outcome.

      confidence: 0.95
  adopted:
    - target: Witten-Sander DLA model
      rationale: The framework provides a new metaphysical and causal interpretation (a "why") for a well-established and computationally verifiable physical process (a "how"). Adopting the standard model provides a direct, falsifiable link to physical reality and simulation.

  claims:
    - statement: "The characteristic fractal dimension of DLA (~1.71 in 2D) represents the optimal structural efficiency for converting uncorrelated potential (Œì) into coherent form (Ki) via a process of irreversible local commitments."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "Discovery of a different local-growth algorithm that produces a demonstrably more 'efficient' structure (e.g., faster dissipation of a field gradient, higher surface area to volume ratio) with a significantly different fractal dimension under identical boundary conditions."

  disambiguation: |
    Within the Pirouette Framework, DLA refers not just to the computational algorithm but to the fundamental physical principle of growth as a geodesic traced by irreversible choices. It is treated as a primary example of physical history manifesting as geometry, not merely as a model of stochastic pattern formation.
