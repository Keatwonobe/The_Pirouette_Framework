        The Coherence Ledger is a protocol and a toolkit for quantifying a system's "fever." It measures the friction and noise generated when a system's flow becomes Turbulent or Stagnant, translating the abstract concept of entropy generation into a hard, undeniable metric.

  art: |
    A stethoscope for reality, translating the silent friction of a system arguing with itself into a hard, undeniable receipt. It is a mirror that reflects the health of our creations, holding us accountable for the coherence we bring into the world.
  law: |
    The Coherence Ledger quantifies a system's rate of coherence loss (Entropic Flux, Ṡ) and records its cumulative value (S) in a cryptographically signed, immutable, and auditable data structure. Its measurements must be proportional to the deviation from a system's maximally coherent, laminar baseline.
  philosophy: |
    By creating an undeniable, tamper-proof record of systemic inefficiency, the Ledger transforms abstract principles of coherence into a tangible basis for accountability. It forces creators to confront the true cost of their design choices, making "building well" a measurable, non-negotiable imperative.
pirouette_definition: |
  A universal protocol and reference architecture for an instrument that quantifies a system's rate of coherence loss (Entropic Flux, Ṡ) and records its cumulative value as a secure, tamper-proof, and auditable time-series log. The Ledger comprises three layers: Sensing (Probe), Computation (Meter), and Attestation (Ledger). It provides the definitive ground truth for diagnosing systemic health, measuring the cost of deviation from a system's ideal geodesic path as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

        outline: |
          1. **Baseline:** Isolate the system under low stress to establish its "Laminar Baseline" where Ṡ ≈ 0.
          2. **Audit:** Deploy the instrument under normal conditions, measuring Ṡ and annotating entropy spikes with causal triggers.
          3. **Attest:** Integrate Ṡ over the audit period to get total coherence loss S, then close, hash, and sign the data block to create an immutable record.
        expected_signals: [Time-series Entropic Flux (Ṡ), annotated event triggers, cryptographic signatures]
        pitfalls: [Improper baseline calibration leading to skewed measurements, failure to correctly attribute entropy spikes to causal events, compromised device key leading to forged attestations]

    excerpt: |
      The Coherence Ledger is a protocol and a toolkit for quantifying a system's "fever." It measures the friction and noise generated when a system's flow becomes Turbulent or Stagnant... It provides the "receipt" for a system's inefficiency, pinning the invisible cost of chaos to an immutable, cryptographically secured record that holds creators accountable for the coherence of their creations.
  - module: DOMA-128
    excerpt: |
      The Entropic Flux (Ṡ) measured by the Coherence Ledger is directly proportional to the "coherence gap"—the difference between the system's actual, measured Lagrangian value and the theoretical maximum it could achieve in its environment. A reading from the Coherence Ledger is therefore a direct measurement of the *cost of deviation* from the system's own most elegant path of existence.

    - target: dS/dt (Entropy production rate)
      domain: Thermodynamics
      mapping_kind: mathematical
      equation_hint: |
        Ṡ_total = dS_sys/dt + dS_surr/dt ≥ 0
      justification: |
        The Entropic Flux (Ṡ) is explicitly defined as the rate of entropy generation due to irreversible, incoherent processes. This directly maps to the concept of entropy production in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which quantifies the energy rendered unavailable for work due to friction and dissipation.

      confidence: 0.8
  adopted:
    - target: dS/dt (Entropy production rate)
      rationale: The definition of Coherence Loss Units (CLU) as Joules of wasted energy provides a direct operational bridge to the thermodynamic concept of entropy production. This mapping is more concrete and measurable than purely informational analogues.
      confidence: 0.8
constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A system with a higher measured Entropic Flux (Ṡ) will exhibit lower operational efficiency (e.g., more wasted heat, higher error rates, lower throughput) compared to an equivalent system with a lower Ṡ under the same Temporal Pressure."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "An observation where a system with a demonstrably higher Ṡ performs more efficiently or with greater stability than a system with a lower Ṡ, when all other conditions are controlled."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from financial or blockchain "ledgers." While the Coherence Ledger uses cryptographic hashing and signing for immutability, its primary function is not transaction processing but the creation of an auditable scientific record of a system's dynamic state.
