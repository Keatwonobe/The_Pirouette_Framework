    A system's life is a river. It can flow smoothly with purpose, churn in chaotic rapids, or become a dead, silent pool. To know the river is to know the life it carries.
  law: |
    Any process involving the transport of energy, matter, or information within a system can be qualitatively classified as Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant. This classification serves as a primary, non-invasive diagnostic of system health and coherence.
  philosophy: |
    Before one can ask "why" a system is failing, one must first be able to say "how." Flow Dynamics provides the fundamental language of "how," describing the behavior of a system independent of its specific physical substrate. It is the universal entry point for diagnosis.
pirouette_definition: |
  A diagnostic language used to qualitatively classify the state of transport processes (e.g., energy, resources, information) within a defined system boundary. It assigns one of three states: **Laminar** (predictable, efficient, coherent flow), **Turbulent** (chaotic, inefficient, high-variance flow), or **Stagnant** (blocked, minimal, or absent flow). This classification is the foundational layer of analysis in mapping system coherence and pathology.

        The transition from laminar to turbulent flow in classical fluid mechanics is governed by the dimensionless Reynolds number. Pirouette's Flow Dynamics abstracts this concept, applying the laminar/turbulent/stagnant trichotomy to generalized "flows" of information or resources, where analogous principles of inertia vs. viscosity (or signal vs. noise) apply.

  disambiguation: |
    While the terminology is borrowed directly from classical fluid mechanics, Pirouette's "Flow Dynamics" is a generalized abstraction. It applies to any quantifiable transport process, including non-physical ones like the flow of information in a network, belief in a population, or resources in an economy. The core concept is the *quality* of the transport, not the physical properties of the medium.

# Flow Dynamics

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A diagnostic language used to qualitatively classify the state of transport processes (e.g., energy, resources, information) within a defined system boundary. It assigns one of three states: **Laminar** (predictable, efficient, coherent flow), **Turbulent** (chaotic, inefficient, high-variance flow), or **Stagnant** (blocked, minimal, or absent flow). This classification is the foundational layer of analysis in mapping system coherence and pathology.

## EFT-First Summary
Flow Dynamics provides a qualitative, system-level description analogous to the role of the **Reynolds Number** in classical fluid mechanics. Where the Reynolds Number quantifies the transition from smooth (laminar) to chaotic (turbulent) fluid flow, Pirouette's framework generalizes this distinction to any transport process. The states of Laminar, Turbulent, and Stagnant serve as a universal, first-order diagnostic for system behavior, indicating whether a system is operating efficiently, chaotically, or has ceased to function.
