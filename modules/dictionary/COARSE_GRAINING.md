  art: |
    Smudging the frenetic dance of microscopic details to reveal the slow, graceful waltz of the cosmos. It is the art of seeing the forest for the trees, where the shape of spacetime emerges from the collective whisper of innumerable quantum fluctuations.
  law: |
    A procedure that separates physical scales by integrating out high-frequency field fluctuations below a characteristic length scale L. The resulting effective theory governs the low-frequency dynamics, and its stress-energy tensor, ⟨Tμν⟩, must be covariantly conserved as a consequence of the underlying symmetries.
  philosophy: |
    Coarse-graining embodies the principle of emergence, showing how simple, universal laws arise from complex, specific foundations. It is the mathematical bridge from the microscopic reality of the Pirouette Lagrangian to the macroscopic experience of gravity, proving that not all information is equally relevant at all scales.
pirouette_definition: |
  A mathematical procedure, symbolized by `⟨⋅⟩`, that averages microscopic fields (like the Coherence field C and Temporal Pressure field Γ) over a mesoscopic spacetime volume of characteristic size L, where L is much larger than the microscopic scale but much smaller than the scale of spacetime curvature. This process integrates out sub-L fluctuations (δC, δΓ) via a path integral to produce an effective action, `S_eff`, which governs the dynamics of the averaged fields (`⟨C⟩`, `⟨Γ⟩`). It is the core mechanism by which macroscopic laws, specifically General Relativity, emerge from the fundamental Pirouette action.

          1. Acquire high-resolution data for a microscopic field configuration X(x) over a large volume.
          2. Define a filter function (e.g., a Gaussian or boxcar window) of characteristic width L.
          3. Convolve the filter with the data X(x) to compute the coarse-grained field ⟨X⟩(x).
          4. Numerically compute the power spectrum of the original field X, the mean field ⟨X⟩, and the fluctuation field δX = X - ⟨X⟩.
        expected_signals:
          - A power spectrum for X showing two distinct regimes.
          - The power spectrum of ⟨X⟩ is concentrated at low momenta (k < 1/L).
          - The power spectrum of δX is concentrated at high momenta (k > 1/L).
        pitfalls:
          - Choosing a scale L where there is no clear separation between microscopic and macroscopic dynamics, leading to a poorly defined effective theory.
          - Using a filter function that introduces artifacts or breaks fundamental symmetries.

        The Pirouette coarse-graining procedure is a direct implementation of the Wilsonian effective field theory paradigm. Integrating out the high-frequency fluctuation fields (δC, δΓ) to obtain an effective action (S_eff) for the low-frequency mean fields (⟨C⟩, ⟨Γ⟩) is precisely the first step of a renormalization group flow. This maps the concept directly onto one of the most powerful tools in theoretical physics.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, the brackets ⟨⋅⟩ always denote a spacetime average over a mesoscopic volume to integrate out fluctuations, as defined in the path integral for the effective action. This should be distinguished from a quantum expectation value, which is a trace over a Hilbert space (Tr[ρO]). The context—field theory and emergence versus quantum states—resolves the ambiguity.

# Coarse-Graining

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A mathematical procedure, symbolized by `⟨⋅⟩`, that averages microscopic fields (like the Coherence field C and Temporal Pressure field Γ) over a mesoscopic spacetime volume of characteristic size L, where L is much larger than the microscopic scale but much smaller than the scale of spacetime curvature. This process integrates out sub-L fluctuations (δC, δΓ) via a path integral to produce an effective action, `S_eff`, which governs the dynamics of the averaged fields (`⟨C⟩`, `⟨Γ⟩`). It is the core mechanism by which macroscopic laws, specifically General Relativity, emerge from the fundamental Pirouette action.

## EFT-First Summary
This process is the Pirouette Framework's implementation of the Wilsonian effective field theory (EFT) paradigm. By integrating out short-wavelength fluctuations of the fundamental Coherence (C) and Temporal Pressure (Γ) fields below a scale L, one derives an effective action for the long-wavelength modes. This procedure naturally generates the Einstein-Hilbert action for geometry, with General Relativity acting as the emergent, low-energy description of the underlying system. This is directly analogous to deriving hydrodynamics from molecular dynamics.
