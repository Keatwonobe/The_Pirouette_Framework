A system's internal pattern (`Ki`) is most stable within a specific ambient temporal pressure, its "sweet spot" `Γ₀`. Too little pressure (`Γ << Γ₀`) and the pattern dissolves; too much (`Γ >> Γ₀`) and it is crushed. The simplest invariant motif describing this is a parabolic basin:

    A musician finds the resonant sweet spot on their instrument where the note is clearest and fullest. Straying too far in either direction—a string too tight or too loose—chokes the sound or makes it waver. The Pressure Basin is the geometry of that essential negotiation.
  law: |
    The environmental potential energy cost for a system is proportional to the square of its deviation from its optimal ambient temporal pressure (`Γ₀`). This cost function, `V_env = λ_Γ(Γ - Γ₀)²`, forms a symmetric, parabolic potential well.
  philosophy: |
    Existence is a negotiation, not a monologue. The Pressure Basin establishes that no system is an island; its persistence and coherence depend fundamentally on maintaining a viable relationship with its environment, penalizing both isolation and over-saturation.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Pressure Basin is the invariant, parabolic potential energy motif that quantifies the environmental cost for a system to exist at an ambient temporal pressure (`Γ`) different from its optimal pressure (`Γ₀`). It is the first term, `λ_Γ(Γ - Γ₀)²`, in the Temporal Pressure manifold `V_Γ` and is a necessary component of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The basin's curvature, `λ_Γ`, measures the system's sensitivity to its environment, ensuring that systems are driven towards pressures where their internal coherence is most stable.

        outline: |
          Systematically vary the ambient temporal pressure `Γ` of the environment containing the system under study. At each step, measure a proxy for system stability, such as Time Adherence (`T_a`). The pressure `Γ` at which `T_a` is maximized corresponds to `Γ₀`. The rate at which `T_a` falls off as `Γ` deviates from `Γ₀` allows for fitting the parabolic curve and determining the Pressure Curvature `λ_Γ`.

        The Pressure Basin describes a stable equilibrium (`Γ₀`) and a quadratic energy cost for deviations. This is mathematically identical to the second-order Taylor expansion of any potential around a stable minimum, such as the potential for a scalar field `ϕ` around its vacuum expectation value `v`. `Γ` maps to the field `ϕ`, `Γ₀` to the vacuum expectation value `v`, and `λ_Γ` to the mass-squared term `½m²` that defines the potential's curvature.

  disambiguation: |
    While sharing the concept of a potential well with a "basin of attraction" in dynamical systems, the Pressure Basin is a specific term within the Pirouette Framework. It refers exclusively to the environmental component of the `V_Γ` potential in the Lagrangian, which is a static function of ambient temporal pressure `Γ`, not a region in a system's phase space.

# Pressure Basin

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Pressure Basin is the invariant, parabolic potential energy motif that quantifies the environmental cost for a system to exist at an ambient temporal pressure (`Γ`) different from its optimal pressure (`Γ₀`). It is the first term, `λ_Γ(Γ - Γ₀)²`, in the Temporal Pressure manifold `V_Γ` and is a necessary component of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The basin's curvature, `λ_Γ`, measures the system's sensitivity to its environment, ensuring that systems are driven towards pressures where their internal coherence is most stable.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pressure Basin is mathematically analogous to the potential energy of a scalar field (`ϕ`) near its stable vacuum expectation value (`v`), as described in Effective Field Theory (EFT). The term `λ_Γ(Γ - Γ₀)²` has the same quadratic form as `V(ϕ) ≈ ½m²(ϕ - v)²`, where the ambient Temporal Pressure `Γ` plays the role of the field, the optimal pressure `Γ₀` acts as the vacuum, and the Pressure Curvature `λ_Γ` corresponds to the field's mass, which determines the steepness of the potential well. This formulation treats environmental pressure as a background field to which a system must conform or pay an energy cost.
