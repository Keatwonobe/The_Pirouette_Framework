        Holonomy: assign a phase (φ(γ)∈ U(1)) to each closed loop (γ) in the order complex (simplicial complex built from chains). A *spin structure* is a (Z_2) lift with the rule that certain fundamental 2-spheres carry a sign.

  art: |
    A memory of passage, etched as a twist in the fabric of becoming. Each causal loop retains a phase, a whisper of the geometry it enclosed, governing the interference between histories.
  law: |
    The holonomy Φ(γ) of a closed loop γ in the order complex is a U(1) phase factor, e^(iφ(γ)). The product of holonomies for concatenated loops is the product of their phases: Φ(γ₂ ∘ γ₁) = Φ(γ₂)Φ(γ₁). The action functional S contains a coherence term weighting causal diamonds (⋄) by cos(Φ(∂⋄)).
  philosophy: |
    Holonomy provides the substrate with an intrinsic memory of causal paths, introducing a U(1) gauge structure from first principles. It is the fundamental source of interference, coherence, and the spin-½ property of matter motifs, grounding these physical phenomena in pure relational order rather than an assumed spacetime continuum.
pirouette_definition: |
  Holonomy, Φ, is a map from the set of closed loops (γ) in the order complex of a fabric E to the group U(1). It assigns a phase e^(iφ(γ)) to each loop, satisfying multiplicativity for concatenated loops (Φ(γ₂ ∘ γ₁) = Φ(γ₂)Φ(γ₁)) and inversion for reversed loops (Φ(γ⁻¹) = Φ(γ)⁻¹). It is a foundational geometric structure, defining spin via the Spin-½ Axiom (A5) and contributing to the Action functional S via a coherence term, typically of the form `-b cos(Φ(∂⋄))` for minimal causal diamonds ⋄.

        outline: |
          1. Posit an action functional S with a holonomy-dependent coherence term, `S_Φ = -b Σ cos(Φ(∂⋄))`.
          2. Simulate fabric growth using the full action S for a range of the coupling parameter `b`.
          3. Measure the population statistics of specific motifs, particularly those forming small causal diamonds.
          4. The deviation of motif counts from a simulation with `b=0` constrains the value of `b` and the average value of `cos(Φ)` over the ensemble of diamonds.
        expected_signals:
          - For `b>0`, a statistically significant over-representation of "phase-locked" motifs where `cos(Φ(∂⋄))` is near +1.
        pitfalls:
          - Inference is model-dependent on the assumed form of `S`.
          - Disentangling the effects of the coherence term from the "pressure" terms (e.g., raw interval counts) can be difficult if their geometric consequences are correlated.

      justification: |
        Holonomy is a non-local, path-dependent phase assigned to a closed loop, directly analogous to the Wilson loop in gauge theory which path-integrates a connection 1-form (A) around a loop. The Σ bridge functor is designed to map the fabric's holonomy to an emergent U(1) gauge connection in the effective spacetime description.

    - target: Wilson Loop (U(1) Gauge Theory)
      rationale: This mapping is explicitly intended by the framework's Σ bridge functor, providing the primary mechanism by which gauge interactions emerge from the substrate.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "The framework's holonomy structure supports a fundamental spin-½ lift (Axiom A5), meaning there exist loops γ such that Φ(γ) is a non-trivial element of Z₂ (i.e., -1)."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "If all stable particle motifs and their interactions could be fully explained without invoking a Z₂ lift (i.e., only with holonomies where Φ(γ²) = Φ(γ)²), the spin-½ axiom would be superfluous and falsified by Occam's razor."

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, Φ is fundamentally a functional on loops in the abstract order complex (a map `Φ: Loops(C(E)) -> U(1)`), not a field on a spacetime manifold. An effective scalar or gauge field can emerge from the statistics of Φ values under the Σ functor, but Φ itself is the more primitive concept.
