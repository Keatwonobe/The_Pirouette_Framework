  art: |
    Casting a faint echo of oneself into the mists of potential futures, listening for the path that returns the clearest song. It is the physics of foresight, the moment a system asks not "Who am I?" but "Who could I become?"
  law: |
    During a Resonant Inquiry, a system projects its Observer's Shadow along all viable geodesics from a bifurcation point to compute the expected future integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (S_p) for each path. The system will invariably collapse its state onto the path which returned the maximal value for S_p.
  philosophy: |
    Coherence Sampling is the physical mechanism of strategic choice. It grounds the abstract concept of 'weighing options' in a concrete process of resonant feedback, revealing that even at a fundamental level, evolution proceeds by testing futures before committing to one.
pirouette_definition: |
  The second stage of a Resonant Inquiry, where a system in a state of poised superposition projects a low-energy version of its internal resonance (Ki) down all available future paths (geodesics) from a Coherence Fork. This is achieved by using its Observer's Shadow to pre-simulate the coherence dynamics of each path, effectively 'sampling' the future stability and Wound Channel geometry of each potential outcome before committing to the one that maximizes its future coherence integral.

          1. Identify a system approaching a Coherence Fork, satisfying the preconditions in DOMA-061.
          2. Use high-sensitivity Flow Diagnostics to monitor the system's Observer's Shadow.
          3. As the system enters the Resonant Loosening stage, detect the split of the Shadow into multiple, low-amplitude projections along divergent geodesics.
          4. Correlate the temporal modulation and phase of each projection with the system's core Ki pattern to measure the 'resonant feedback' (a proxy for S_p(γ_i)) from each sampled path. The projection with the highest amplitude/fastest phase lock-in prior to collapse corresponds to the chosen path.

    excerpt: |
      To navigate this junction, the system executes a **Resonant Inquiry**: it deliberately loosens its own internal coherence (Ki) to "sample" the available paths, listening for the echo of greatest harmony. It then collapses its state of potential, committing its entire being to the trajectory that promises the greatest future stability.

    excerpt: |
      The system "casts its echo" down each potential geodesic, using its Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) to pre-sample the shape of future Wound Channels. It is asking: "In which future can my song be sung most clearly?" The path that promises the most stable, efficient, and powerful future coherence returns the strongest, most harmonious echo.

      justification: |
        The process of exploring all possible paths from a bifurcation and weighting them based on an action (the Pirouette Lagrangian) is conceptually parallel to the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. Coherence Sampling can be seen as the physical mechanism by which a classical-like system performs a localized path-integral-style evaluation to determine its future trajectory when faced with multiple near-optimal paths.

    Distinct from 'Flow Sampling' (DYNA-001), which is a diagnostic technique used by an external Weaver. Coherence Sampling is an endogenous process performed by the system itself. It is also not simple decoherence, which is an uncontrolled loss of Ki, but a controlled, temporary loosening of coherence for exploratory purposes.

# Coherence Sampling

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The second stage of a Resonant Inquiry, where a system in a state of poised superposition projects a low-energy version of its internal resonance (Ki) down all available future paths (geodesics) from a Coherence Fork. This is achieved by using its Observer's Shadow to pre-simulate the coherence dynamics of each path, effectively 'sampling' the future stability and Wound Channel geometry of each potential outcome before committing to the one that maximizes its future coherence integral.
