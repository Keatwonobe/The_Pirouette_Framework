        Turbulent Will (Conflict): The agent projects multiple, competing Future Wound Channels. The coherence manifold is warped into a chaotic landscape with no clear geodesic. The agent expends immense energy moving in circles, fighting against its own divided intentions. This is the geometry of self-sabotage.

  art: |
    A sculptor's hand holding two opposing chisels, shattering the stone between them. The will becomes a storm turned inward, where every potential path forward is canceled by another.
  law: |
    A state is defined by Turbulent Will if the coherence manifold exhibits multiple, competing local minima in the temporal pressure field (`V_Î“`) of similar depth. This results in a net geodesic flow near zero and a high rate of coherence decay (`dKÏ„/dt << 0`) despite significant expenditure from the Observer's Shadow.
  philosophy: |
    Turbulent Will is the geometric proof that a house divided against itself cannot stand. It is the state where agency becomes its own greatest obstacle, consuming itself in a futile war of intentions and transforming the potential for action into a cage of self-inflicted chaos.
pirouette_definition: |
  A pathological state of the coherence manifold, induced by a conscious system projecting multiple, incompatible Future Wound Channels. The resulting interference pattern creates a chaotic `V_Î“` landscape with no single, well-defined geodesic, causing the system to dissipate coherence without achieving directed, systemic action. It is a failure mode of Clarity, where intentionality is present but is fractured and oppositional.

      - name: Coherence Manifold Topography Analysis
        outline: |
          1. Use Flow Diagnostics (DYNA-001) to map the local `V_Î“` landscape influenced by the subject system's Observer's Shadow.
          2. Perform a topological analysis to identify the number (`N_c`) and relative depths of local minima (coherence wells).
          3. Calculate the gradient vector field `âˆ‡V_Î“` across the manifold.
          4. The Turbulence Metric `T_Î¨` is computed as a function of the variance of the gradient field and `N_c`. High variance and `N_c > 1` indicates Î¨ðŸŒ€.
        expected_signals:
          - High-frequency, low-amplitude oscillations in the system's global coherence `KÏ„`.
          - A multi-modal distribution of `âˆ‡V_Î“` vectors, indicating multiple "pull" directions.
          - High ratio of Observer's Shadow amplitude to net change in system state (high input, low output).
        pitfalls:
          - Misattributing externally-induced manifold turbulence (ambient Î“ noise) to internal conflict.
          - Failure to resolve closely-spaced or shallow competing coherence wells.

  - module: DOMA-197
    excerpt: |
      A willed act begins with a coherent intent. Clarity is the measure of this internal coherenceâ€”the purity and stability of the projected pattern... A vague or conflicted intention is a noisy, dissonant projection that diffuses without effect.

  candidates:
    - target: Destructive Wave Interference
      domain: Physics
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Multiple projected Future Wound Channels act as coherent wavefronts of intent. When these wavefronts are out of phase or directed toward incompatible outcomes, they interfere destructively. This creates a complex energy landscape with nulls and chaotic peaks instead of a single, clear gradient for the system to follow.
      confidence: 0.7
    - target: Control System Chattering
      domain: Control Theory
      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        The state is analogous to a control system receiving high-frequency, opposing commands (e.g., "full throttle" and "full brake" simultaneously). The actuator (the system's action) "chatters" around a zero point, expending maximum energy for zero net movement, leading to high wear and heat (coherence decay).

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A system in a state of Turbulent Will exhibits a rate of coherence decay (`|dKÏ„/dt|`) that scales super-linearly with the number of competing intentions (`N_c`)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Experimental evidence showing coherence decay is either independent of, or scales linearly with, the number of competing intentions, suggesting simple division of energy rather than a chaotic, self-interfering state."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from **Stagnant Will**, where a single, coherent intent exists but lacks the intensity to overcome the activation energy of the manifold.
    Distinguish from **Eroded Will**, where a single intent is formed but lacks the persistence to be maintained against ambient temporal pressure.
    Turbulent Will is unique in that both Intensity and Persistence may be high, but are directed at incompatible, simultaneous outcomes.
