        The Gyroid Loom is a computational protocol that takes sparse, 2D observations and infers the full, three-dimensional coherence manifold of the system under study.

  art: |
    The gyroid is the loom upon which a system weaves its own being, a silent testament to a battle won against the ceaseless pressure of chaos.
  law: |
    Given sparse 2D observational projections of a system under temporal pressure, the most probable 3D coherence manifold (Ki) that satisfies these boundary conditions is the one that minimizes the Pirouette Lagrangian, which is often a gyroidal minimal surface.
  philosophy: |
    This tool transforms tomographic reconstruction from a simple act of stacking images into a profound act of inferring a system's chosen solution for existence, turning observers into true diagnosticians of a system's hidden, geometric soul.
pirouette_definition: |
  A computational protocol that infers a system's three-dimensional coherence manifold (Ki) from a set of sparse, two-dimensional observational slices. It reframes tomographic reconstruction by solving for the most probable gyroidal minimal surface that satisfies the observational data as boundary conditions, based on the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The Loom assumes that complex systems under pressure naturally organize into such geometries to maximize their internal stability.

        outline: |
          1. **Projection:** Convert each 2D data slice into a sinogram via Radon-FFT transform.
          2. **Mapping:** Unwind the stack of sinograms onto helical coordinates, treating the stack axis as a temporal or phase proxy.
          3. **Solving:** Use the mapped data as boundary conditions to iteratively solve for the coherence manifold (ψ) that represents a stable state for the system's Pirouette Lagrangian, fitting a gyroidal solution.
          4. **Export:** Generate a 3D mesh (e.g., STL) and a 3D field map of the final manifold (Ki) for diagnostic analysis.

        pitfalls: [Input data is too sparse or noisy, leading to low Observational Fidelity; The system's true Ki is not gyroidal, resulting in a poor fit.]

    excerpt: |
      It is founded on a key insight: under pressure, many complex systems—from plasma instabilities to biological tissues—naturally organize into a gyroid geometry. This is not an accident; the gyroid is one of nature's most elegant solutions to the problem of maximizing coherence. This tool transforms tomographic reconstruction from a simple act of stacking images into a profound act of inferring a system's chosen solution for existence.
  - module: DOMA-187
    excerpt: |
      A system that adopts a gyroidal Ki has found a profound "sweet spot" in the landscape of the Lagrangian. It has woven itself into a form that maximizes its internal coherence (Kτ) while expertly navigating and dissipating the external Temporal Pressure (Γ). This tool is designed to find that form.
  - module: DOMA-187
    excerpt: |
      The output of the Loom is not just a picture; it is a diagnostic report on the system's health... Manifold Coherence (`Kτ_manifold`) measures how closely the reconstructed geometry fits an ideal, mathematically perfect gyroid. A high value signifies a system in a state of healthy Laminar Flow. A low value suggests internal friction, damage, or Turbulent Flow.

      justification: |
        The Gyroid Loom is a specialized form of tomographic reconstruction. Unlike standard methods (e.g., FBP), the Loom imposes a strong physical prior: that the underlying structure is a gyroidal minimal surface that optimizes a physical Lagrangian. This is conceptually equivalent to a Bayesian method where the prior distribution is heavily weighted towards gyroidal solutions.

    - target: Bayesian Tomographic Reconstruction with a Minimal Surface Prior
      rationale: This mapping correctly captures the core operational difference: the use of a strong, physically-motivated geometric assumption (the gyroid as a solution to the Lagrangian) to guide reconstruction from sparse data, a hallmark of Bayesian inference.

    Distinguish from standard tomographic reconstruction, which typically builds a 3D model by stacking independent 2D slices without an underlying physical manifold assumption. The Gyroid Loom does not *stack* images; it *infers* a single, global 3D geometry that best explains the entire set of 2D slices simultaneously.

# Gyroid Loom

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A computational protocol that infers a system's three-dimensional coherence manifold (Ki) from a set of sparse, two-dimensional observational slices. It reframes tomographic reconstruction by solving for the most probable gyroidal minimal surface that satisfies the observational data as boundary conditions, based on the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The Loom assumes that complex systems under pressure naturally organize into such geometries to maximize their internal stability.

## EFT-First Summary
The Gyroid Loom is an operational protocol analogous to **Bayesian Tomographic Reconstruction with a Minimal Surface Prior**. Where standard tomography reconstructs a density field from projections, the Loom reconstructs a geometric manifold. It uses a strong physical assumption—that the system's structure is a gyroid that optimizes a Lagrangian—as a prior to solve for the full 3D geometry from limited 2D data. This is particularly effective for systems where this physical prior holds true, such as in magnetically confined plasmas or certain biological tissues.
