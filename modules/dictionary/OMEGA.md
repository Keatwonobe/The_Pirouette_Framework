      snippet: |
        The Pirouette Framework redefines the microstate. A microstate is not a configuration in physical space, but a resonant mode in the coherence manifold. Omega is therefore the total number of resonant modes available to a system and its environment.

  art: |
    The vast, silent chorus of everything that could possibly be. Omega is the total number of ways a system can "be" without being a specific, coherent song.
  law: |
    The entropy (S) of a system is the natural logarithm of its accessible resonant modes (Ω), scaled by the Boltzmann constant (k_B): S = k_B * ln(Ω). The total Ω for a composite system is the product of the Omegas of its subsystems (Ω_total = Ω_sys * Ω_env).
  philosophy: |
    Omega represents the statistical landscape of possibility. A system's coherence is measured by how few of the total available modes it occupies; the arrow of time is the statistical inevitability of a system dissipating into this vast landscape.
pirouette_definition: |
  The total number of accessible resonant modes available to a system, representing its phase space volume in the coherence manifold. In statistical mechanics, Ω quantifies the multiplicity of microscopic configurations corresponding to a single macroscopic state. It is the fundamental quantity from which entropy (S) is derived via the Boltzmann relation S = k_B * ln(Ω).

        outline: |
          Omega is not measured directly. It is inferred by first measuring a system's macroscopic thermodynamic properties (Temperature T, Energy U, Volume V) to calculate its entropy S, then inverting the Boltzmann equation: Ω = exp(S / k_B).
        expected_signals: [Macroscopic thermodynamic observables (temperature, pressure, heat capacity)]
        pitfalls: [Requires a complete statistical model of the system to correctly calculate S from macroscopic variables. The absolute value of Ω is astronomically large and sensitive to the definition of a 'microstate', making relative changes (ratios) more physically meaningful.]

    excerpt: |
      The Pirouette Framework redefines the microstate. A microstate is not a configuration in physical space, but a resonant mode in the coherence manifold. A Low-Entropy System has a high degree of internal coherence (K_tau); its Ω_system is very low. A High-Entropy Environment has a low degree of coherence; its Ω_environment is enormous.
  - module: MATH-003
    excerpt: |
      Consider a small, coherent system in thermal contact with a large, high-pressure environment. The total number of microstates for the combined system is: Ω_total = Ω_system * Ω_environment. Because Ω_environment is vastly larger than Ω_system, the increase in ln(Ω_environment) from dissipated coherence will always be greater than the decrease in ln(Ω_system).

        S = k_B * ln(Ω)
      justification: |
        The Pirouette Framework adopts the symbol and mathematical role of Ω from Boltzmann's statistical mechanics but redefines the underlying 'microstate' from a configuration of particles in physical space to a resonant mode in the coherence manifold. This re-basing allows entropy to be understood as a measure of dissipated coherence.

  adopted:
    - target: Number of accessible microstates (Ω) in statistical mechanics.
      rationale: The term directly repurposes the established concept from statistical mechanics, redefining its constituent elements (microstates) to fit the Framework's ontology of resonance and coherence.

      falsifier: "Discovery of a fundamental non-multiplicative composition rule for resonant modes, suggesting a different statistical basis than Boltzmann's. This would invalidate the additive property of entropy as derived in the framework."

  disambiguation: |
    In the context of thermodynamics and information theory within the Pirouette Framework, Ω always refers to the number of resonant modes, not electrical resistance or the cosmological density parameter.
