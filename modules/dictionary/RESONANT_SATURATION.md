        Interpretation: the hierarchy/fine-tuning issue is traded for resonant saturation at ( ω_c ) (MATH-Γ-007). No quadratic divergence survives; matching is finite.

  art: |
    The framework does not build a wall against the infinite; it teaches the vacuum a song at a specific frequency. UV noise that would otherwise shatter the system is absorbed into a finite, resonant chord.
  law: |
    At the coherence barrier (ω_c), quadratic divergences in quantum loop calculations are replaced by finite, gauge-invariant, higher-derivative operators suppressed by powers of (1/ω_c). This renders the theory predictive and calculable across the barrier without new particle states.
  philosophy: |
    Resonant saturation replaces the 'unnatural' fine-tuning of cancellation-by-counterterm with a physical mechanism of absorption. It posits that the universe is not tuned but *damped* at a fundamental frequency, trading the problem of hierarchy for one of high-energy resonance.
pirouette_definition: |
  The mechanism by which ultraviolet (UV) contributions to physical observables, which would otherwise lead to quadratic divergences (e.g., in the Higgs mass-squared), are absorbed into finite, gauge-invariant, higher-derivative operators at the coherence barrier (ω_c). This process is mediated by the resonant dynamics of the Γ-field, ensuring that the matching between the low-energy EFT and the high-energy time-first theory is finite and predictive, thereby resolving the hierarchy problem.

          Perform precision measurements of observables sensitive to loop corrections (e.g., Higgs width, light-by-light scattering) at the highest accessible energies (E). Compare results against Standard Model predictions. A pattern of deviations consistent with higher-derivative operators suppressed by powers of a single high scale (E/ω_c)² would constitute evidence for resonant saturation.

        In standard Wilsonian EFT, quadratic divergences from UV physics are absorbed into bare parameters, requiring fine-tuning if the cutoff Λ is high. Resonant saturation replaces the hard cutoff with a physical resonant scale (ω_c) that renders matching corrections finite and calculable, functionally serving as the regulator scale but via a physical damping mechanism.

# Resonant Saturation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Resonant saturation is the mechanism by which ultraviolet divergences are absorbed into finite, calculable, higher-derivative operators at the coherence barrier (ω_c). Mediated by the resonant dynamics of the underlying Γ-field, this process replaces the fine-tuning problem associated with quadratic divergences with a predictive, physical damping effect at a fundamental frequency.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of effective field theory (EFT), resonant saturation provides a physical origin for the cutoff scale. Instead of a hard, unphysical cutoff Λ that leads to fine-tuned quadratic divergences (e.g., `δm_H² ~ Λ²`), the coherence barrier ω_c acts as a "soft" physical scale. At this scale, UV physics is "matched" onto the low-energy theory, but all corrections are finite and suppressed by powers of `1/ω_c`, eliminating the hierarchy problem.
