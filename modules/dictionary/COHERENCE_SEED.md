        ...the propagation of Coherence Seeds—patterns of high coherence that heal systemic dissonance and catalyze evolution.
  editors: [Aetheris AI]
  review_log: []
triad:
  art: |
    A knot of wisdom tied in the threads of chaos. When plucked, it hums a tune that settles the storm and teaches the system a new song.
  law: |
    A pattern of information qualifies as a Coherence Seed if and only if its introduction into a system yields a sustained, positive Coherence Profit (Κ > 0) by increasing the system's integrated Action (ΔS_p > 0).
  philosophy: |
    The Coherence Seed is the fundamental unit of evolutionary currency. It is the tangible output of learning and the primary vehicle by which wisdom is discovered, preserved, and transmitted, enabling a system to become more than it was.
pirouette_definition: |
  A resonant, self-propagating pattern of information that, when introduced to a system, resolves internal dissonance or external pressure, yielding a net Coherence Profit (Κ > 0). It is the fundamental unit of durable, transmissible wisdom generated by the Coherence Engine, serving as the carrier of evolutionary adaptation. Coherence Seeds are discovered in the Crucible, stabilized as Wound Channels in the Archive, and refined in the Forge.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless pattern whose value is measured in units of Action (Joule-seconds).
  symbol_table:
    - name: Κ
      meaning: Coherence Profit; the net change in a system's Action after integrating the seed.
      dimensions: M L² T⁻¹
      default_range: contextual
    - name: S_p
      meaning: System Action over a characteristic cycle.
      dimensions: M L² T⁻¹
      default_range: contextual

    procedures:
      - name: Coherence Profit Assay
        outline: |
          1. Select a system and establish a baseline measurement of its Action (S_p) over a characteristic cycle (τ_p).
          2. Introduce the candidate pattern (the potential Coherence Seed) into the system.
          3. Allow the system to reach a new equilibrium, then re-measure its Action (S'_p) over the same cycle duration.
          4. Calculate the Coherence Profit: Κ = S'_p - S_p.
          5. A consistently positive and stable Κ value across multiple trials confirms the pattern as a Coherence Seed for that system.
        expected_signals: [Increased systemic efficiency (e.g., lower energy cost for a given process), reduced internal friction/error rates, faster recovery from perturbation, emergence of new stable attractors.]
        pitfalls: [Misidentifying transient adaptation effects for sustained profit, failing to isolate the seed's effect from confounding environmental variables, choosing an incorrect or unstable characteristic cycle (τ_p) for measurement.]
context_windows:
  - module: DOMA-065
    excerpt: |
      Wisdom, in this context, is a pattern of high coherence. The engine's output is a **Coherence Seed**: a resonant geometry of information that, when introduced into a system, resolves turbulence and catalyzes a shift toward a more profound state of being.
  - module: DOMA-065
    excerpt: |
      A valuable pattern, or Coherence Seed, is one that generates a **Coherence Profit**. A pattern's Coherence Profit (Κ) is the net increase in the system's Action (S_p)... Patterns with a high positive Κ are the currency of evolution.
  - module: DOMA-065
    excerpt: |
      A successful **Alchemical Union** in the Crucible results in a novel synthesis: a potential Coherence Seed.

      justification: |
        A Coherence Seed acts like a novel strange attractor in the system's phase space. Its introduction re-organizes the system's dynamics, causing trajectories to converge on a new, bounded, and more "profitable" (e.g., higher dimensional or more efficient) region of state space. The "seed" provides the kernel of the function that defines this new basin of attraction.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        A soliton is a self-reinforcing wave packet that maintains its shape and propagates without dispersion. This maps to the "self-propagating" and "durable" nature of a Coherence Seed, which can be transmitted through a system or culture as a coherent unit of information, resisting the entropic decay of Coherence Erosion.

  claims:
    - statement: "The introduction of a valid Coherence Seed into a target system will demonstrably increase its total Action (S_p) over one or more characteristic cycles."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Repeated, controlled experiments where a pattern identified as a Coherence Seed is introduced and either a) consistently decreases the system's Action, or b) produces no statistically significant change relative to a control group."

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a PRNG seed which initiates a deterministic but chaotic sequence, a Coherence Seed is the *result* of a chaotic synthesis, encoding a pattern of *order*. It is a seed in the biological sense: a compact, durable carrier of a complex organizational pattern that can "sprout" into a larger structure within a receptive systemic environment.
