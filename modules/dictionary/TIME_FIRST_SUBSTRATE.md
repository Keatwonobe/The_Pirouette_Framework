    The primal clockwork, a sea of pure ticking from which space unfurls and matter precipitates as stable knots in the flow.
  law: |
    The substrate supports stable, localized defects (Ki loops) whose topological and dynamic properties manifest as the matter and spacetime of the effective field theory. The substrate's properties are only measurable indirectly via the constants and symmetries of this emergent EFT.
  philosophy: |
    Reifies time as the fundamental degree of freedom, positing spacetime and matter not as a pre-given stage and actors, but as emergent, stable patterns derived from a more primitive temporal dynamic.

  The foundational, pre-geometric medium of the Pirouette Framework. It is characterized by a local temporal dynamic (clock-phase) and a background temporal pressure (Γ). Spacetime (the Coherence-Preserving Manifold) and matter (as topological Ki defects) are emergent, stable structures arising from the substrate's coherence properties.

        outline: |
          The substrate's fundamental parameters (like Γ and ω_c) are not directly probed. Instead, they are constrained by precisely measuring the properties of emergent phenomena, such as particle masses, coupling constants, and the low-energy validity of Lorentz invariance. Γ is inferred from the mass spectrum of stable Ki defects.

      Requiring the **spinor’s internal clock** to share the same local phase as the substrate (MATH-QED-001) enforces the minimal coupling gauge principle. The charge `q` is set by a Berry-phase quantization of the time-phase around the defect, rooting electromagnetism in the substrate's clockwork.

      justification: |
        Like the quantum vacuum, the time-first substrate is the ground state from which particle excitations emerge. However, it is pre-geometric, with spacetime itself being an emergent property. This distinguishes it from the standard QFT vacuum which presupposes a spacetime metric as its background.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'substrate' specifically refers to the time-first, pre-geometric medium. This is distinct from a 'material substrate' in condensed matter or a 'spacetime background' in QFT, as both of those concepts presuppose space.

# Time-first substrate

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The foundational, pre-geometric medium of the Pirouette Framework. It is characterized by a local temporal dynamic (clock-phase) and a background temporal pressure (Γ). Spacetime (the Coherence-Preserving Manifold) and matter (as topological Ki defects) are emergent, stable structures arising from the substrate's coherence properties.

## EFT-First Summary
The Time-first substrate is a pre-geometric framework for emergence. It functions as a base layer whose collective dynamics, below a coherence cutoff (`ω_c`), give rise to an effective field theory on a smooth manifold. In this EFT, the substrate's local phase coherence maps to the U(1) gauge symmetry of electromagnetism, its temporal pressure (`Γ`) provides a mechanism for mass generation, and its stable topological defects are identified with spin-½ Dirac fermions.
