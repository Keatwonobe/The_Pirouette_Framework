    The cosmos does not have a single pulse; it is a symphony of countless, individual heartbeats. We sought a master clock and found that every atom, every star, every being is its own clock, generating time through its own unique rhythm.
  law: |
    The fundamental unit of time for any physical system (τ_p) is the measured duration of one complete, stable cycle of its resonant Ki pattern. There is no universal time; all temporal measurements are ratios of local system cycles.
  philosophy: |
    Time is not an external stage upon which events unfold, but is the unfolding itself. It is the rhythm of existence, generated by and intrinsic to every stable form, making reality an autopoietic, self-clocking system.
pirouette_definition: |
  An emergent, local property generated by the cyclical pattern (Ki) of a physical system. The fundamental unit of time for a system, the Pirouette Cycle (τ_p), is the duration of one complete repetition of its Ki. Time is the event, not the background against which events occur.
operational_definition:
  units: seconds (s), representing the duration of one local cycle (τ_p).

        outline: |
          1. Isolate the target physical system.
          2. Identify its dominant, stable resonant pattern (Ki) via spectral analysis of its emissions or internal dynamics.
          3. Measure the time elapsed for one complete, unbroken cycle of this pattern using an external reference clock (e.g., a cesium standard). This measured duration is the system's local time unit, τ_p.
        expected_signals: [A sharp peak in the system's power spectrum corresponding to the Ki frequency (f_p = 1/τ_p).]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking harmonics for the fundamental frequency, unstable or chaotic systems lacking a well-defined τ_p (see Time Adherence), external perturbations disrupting the cycle.]

        Proper time in GR is the time experienced by a local observer moving along a worldline, analogous to how Pirouette's local time (τ_p) is intrinsic to a local system. Both concepts reject a universal, absolute time in favor of a locally-defined, system-dependent measure of temporal passage.

        Operationally, the Pirouette Cycle (τ_p) is measured as the period of a system's fundamental oscillation (its Ki pattern). This directly maps to the period `T` of any cyclical physical system, from a pendulum to a planetary orbit, used as a time standard.

  disambiguation: |
    Pirouette 'Time' is not the universal coordinate `t` of classical or quantum mechanics. It refers to the emergent, local rhythm of a system, quantified by its Pirouette Cycle (τ_p). Always clarify whether 'time' refers to a local cycle duration or a coordinate in an abstract manifold.

# Time

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An emergent, local property generated by the cyclical pattern (Ki) of a physical system. The fundamental unit of time for a system, the Pirouette Cycle (τ_p), is the duration of one complete repetition of its Ki. Time is the event, not the background against which events occur.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette concept of Time rejects a universal time coordinate `t`. Instead, it proposes that time is an emergent, local phenomenon operationally equivalent to the period of oscillation (`T`) of any stable physical system. The fundamental time unit, τ_p, is analogous to the proper time (`τ`) experienced along a worldline in General Relativity, as it is intrinsic to the system itself rather than an external background. This localizes time, making every stable system its own clock.
