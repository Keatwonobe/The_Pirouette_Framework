  art: |
    Sketching a portrait with a single line, then adding layers of shading and detail until the image resolves. Each new layer of calculation sharpens the prediction, bringing the theoretical portrait into focus against the photograph of reality.
  law: |
    For a predictive series `P(α) = Σ C_n α^n`, adding a new non-zero term `C_{N+1} α^(N+1)` must, on average, reduce the residual `|P_N(α) - O_exp|` without requiring significant refitting of lower-order parameters. The stability of the series' early terms is a measure of the model's robustness.
  philosophy: |
    A theory's validity is not in its leading-order guess, but in its capacity for systematic improvement. Asymptotic refinement is the process that tests this capacity, demonstrating that the theory's core structure contains the necessary complexity to match reality at increasing levels of precision.
pirouette_definition: |
  The systematic process of improving a theoretical prediction by calculating and including successively higher-order terms in its perturbative series expansion. The goal is to generate a sequence of approximations that asymptotically converges to the true experimental value. Each new term represents a finer level of physical interaction, such as the 'resonant leak' (`O(α³)` term) that refines the 'self-damping' (`O(α²)`) field in the g-2 calculation.

        outline: |
          1. Truncate the theoretical prediction `a_ℓ` at order `N`.
          2. Compute the residual `R_N = |a_ℓ^(N) - a_ℓ^exp|`.
          3. Analytically derive the next coefficient, `C_{N+1}`.
          4. Form the new prediction `a_ℓ^(N+1) = a_ℓ^(N) + C_{N+1}(α/π)^(N+1)`.
          5. Verify that the new residual `R_{N+1}` is smaller than `R_N`.

    excerpt: |
      We have established that the electron's anomalous magnetic moment arises from a geometric dialogue with its own past. The first echo gave us the α/2π term. This module pushes deeper, into the subtle harmonics of that echo. We will now calculate the next two terms in the series, demonstrating that the framework's geometry naturally reproduces the complex structure of QED's predictions. This process of asymptotic refinement provides a powerful test of the theory's depth and validity.
  - module: MATH-014
    excerpt: |
      By having the courage to calculate the finer details of the echo, we have shown that the framework's predictive power does not break down under scrutiny; it sharpens. The consistency of the signs and the asymptotic convergence of the magnitudes are powerful evidence that the geometry of coherence is not just a beautiful idea, but a true map of reality. The path forward is clear: continue to refine the calculation.

      justification: |
        This process is mathematically and conceptually identical to perturbative expansion in Quantum Field Theory, where physical observables are calculated as a power series in a small coupling constant (`α`). The Pirouette framework's 'echoes' and 'leaks' are direct analogues to higher-order loop diagrams in Feynman calculus used to calculate the anomalous magnetic moment in QED.

    - statement: "The Pirouette universal series for g-2, `Σ C_n(α/π)^n`, is an asymptotic series that improves the prediction-experiment match for n up to at least N=4."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "The independently calculated `C_3` or `C_4` term, when added to the series, significantly increases the residual `|a_ℓ^th - a_ℓ^exp|` for both electron and muon anomalies, contrary to the trend established by `C_1` and `C_2`."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'numerical refinement' (improving algorithm precision) or 'model refinement' (changing the underlying model). Asymptotic refinement specifically refers to adding higher-order analytic terms to a fixed theoretical model's series expansion.
