        The health of a system is not a static accounting of assets and liabilities, but the moment-to-moment outcome of a single, fundamental struggle: the drive to generate and sustain internal coherence against the ceaseless, erosive pressure of the external world.

  art: |
    The universe is a constant argument between the song and the static. The Ledger is the living score of that argument, measuring how well a system's resonant song can overcome the silence that seeks to reclaim it.
  law: |
    A system's net vitality is given by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`. The sign of `𝓛_p` determines its state: positive for growth (anabolic), near-zero for stability (homeostatic), and negative for decay (catabolic).
  philosophy: |
    Systemic health is not a state to be possessed but a process to be enacted. This ledger reframes vitality as a continuous, metabolic struggle, providing a universal calculus for persistence and making the work of a Weaver that of a gardener of living patterns.
pirouette_definition: |
  A universal, time-first thermodynamic model that accounts for systemic vitality as the dynamic balance between internally generated temporal coherence (Kτ) and the erosive potential of environmental pressure (V_Γ). It replaces the static `Triaxial Info-Metabolism Framework` with a single measure of net vitality, the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p), which serves as the system's "equity." The Ledger is not a balance sheet but the engine governing the anabolism of coherence and the catabolism from environmental noise.

        outline: |
          1.  Define the system boundary and identify its characteristic signal pattern (`Ki`).
          2.  Measure internal coherence (Kτ) by quantifying the power or amplitude of the system's characteristic signal frequencies against a null baseline.
          3.  Measure the environmental pressure potential (V_Γ) by quantifying the broadband noise and dissonant signals in the system's local environment.
          4.  Calculate the Pirouette Lagrangian: `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`.
          5.  Track Coherence Flux (`d𝓛_p/dt`) by repeating measurements over time.

        pitfalls: [Incorrectly defining system boundaries, mistaking internal noise for external pressure (V_Γ), sampling at a rate too low to capture relevant dynamics.]

This ledger provides the universal calculus for that struggle, replacing all prior balance equations with the framework's core engine: the Pirouette Lagrangian.

    excerpt: |
      The sign of the Lagrangian is the most potent diagnostic of a system's metabolic state. `𝓛_p > 0` (Anabolic State): The system is thriving. `𝓛_p ≈ 0` (Homeostasis): The system is stable. `𝓛_p < 0` (Catabolic State): The system is in decay. Environmental pressure is overwhelming its ability to self-repair.

      justification: |
        The Ledger's equation `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ` is conceptually isomorphic to the negative of the Helmholtz free energy. A system's tendency to maximize `𝓛_p` is equivalent to minimizing `F`. In this mapping, Kτ (coherence) plays the role of internal energy (U), and V_Γ (environmental pressure) plays the role of the thermal disorder term (TS).

      rationale: |
        The mathematical structure `L = (active/kinetic term) - (contextual/potential term)` is a direct and powerful analogy. `Kτ` represents the system's "active" state of maintaining coherence, analogous to kinetic energy `T`. `V_Γ` represents the environmental "potential" that constrains or drains the system, analogous to potential energy `V`. This mapping is operationally clean and highlights the dynamic, rather than purely statistical, nature of the model.

  disambiguation: |
    The "Ledger of Coherence" is not a financial accounting tool but a physical model of vitality based on thermodynamic and informational principles. Unlike the classical Lagrangian from which it derives its form, its terms (Kτ, V_Γ) refer to informational coherence and environmental friction, not position and momentum. The "equity" (𝓛_p) represents the system's capacity for action and persistence.

# Ledger of Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A universal, time-first thermodynamic model that accounts for systemic vitality as the dynamic balance between internally generated temporal coherence (Kτ) and the erosive potential of environmental pressure (V_Γ). It replaces static balance-sheet models with a single measure of net vitality—the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)—which serves as the system's "equity." The Ledger is not a static account but the dynamic engine governing the anabolism of coherence against the catabolism from environmental noise.

## EFT-First Summary
The Ledger of Coherence is formally analogous to the classical Lagrangian (`L = T - V`). A system's vitality (`𝓛_p`) is defined as its temporal coherence `Kτ` (the "kinetic" term, representing the active maintenance of its state) minus the environmental pressure potential `V_Γ` (the "potential" term, representing the erosive cost imposed by its surroundings). Maximizing `𝓛_p` over time is the central dynamic for any persistent system, analogous to the principle of stationary action. This framework recasts thermodynamics and information theory into a dynamical, field-theoretic language.
