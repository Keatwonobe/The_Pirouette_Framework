  art: |
    The universe is not a collection of static things, but a finite grammar of dynamic actions. Existence is a story woven from a small set of resonant verbs, the only words the cosmos knows how to speak.
  law: |
    All persistent systemic states are topologically stable, integer-quantized solutions (`n ‚àà ‚Ñ§`) to the Pirouette Lagrangian's action integral (`‚à´ùìõ_p dt = nƒß_p`), forming a discrete, closed set of interaction modes.
  philosophy: |
    This transforms physics from a description of continuous fields into a language of discrete, meaningful actions. It posits that reality is fundamentally compositional, built from a finite alphabet of 'ways to be,' making the universe both computable and comprehensible.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Lexicon of Resonance is the finite, closed catalog of stable, quantized Ki-resonances that emerge as topologically protected solutions to the Pirouette Lagrangian. These "verbs of existence" represent the discrete geometries of action (e.g., Rest, Motion, Synthesize) that form the complete basis for all systemic states and interactions. Any persistent entity or process must be describable as a pure state or a superposition of states from this lexicon.

          Excite a target system with a broad-spectrum coherence probe. Observe the system's response function by analyzing the geometry and frequency of its emitted Ki signature. The response will show discrete absorption or emission peaks corresponding to the energy gaps between the stable resonant geometries of the Lexicon.

    excerpt: |
      This module provides the bridge from the continuous law to the discrete language of existence. It demonstrates that the stable, quantized states of being‚Äîthe "verbs" of reality‚Äîare not arbitrary, but are the natural, emergent solutions to the universe's core dynamic. They are the vocabulary from which all interaction is composed, the precise syllables in the cosmic song.
  - module: DOMA-017
    excerpt: |
      The interaction between systems is not a collision of objects but an interference of resonant patterns. This interference is governed by a grammar with inviolable rules. The order of operations matters profoundly. Each interaction leaves a scar in the coherence manifold‚Äîa Wound Channel (CORE-011)‚Äîthat alters the landscape for all subsequent actions.

      justification: |
        The Lexicon's stable "verbs" are analogous to the discrete, time-independent solutions (eigenstates) of the Schr√∂dinger equation for a bound system. Both represent stable, quantized modes of being that form a basis for all other possible states via superposition.

    - target: Solitonic states / Topological charges
      rationale: |
        This mapping better captures the dual nature of the Lexicon's "verbs" as both wave-like resonant patterns and particle-like, topologically stable entities that resist decay. The integer 'n' maps directly to the concept of a conserved topological charge or winding number that characterizes a soliton.

      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "The experimental discovery of a novel, stable interaction geometry that cannot be described as a superposition of the known Lexicon verbs would falsify the claim of closure."

# Lexicon of Resonance

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Lexicon of Resonance is the finite, closed catalog of stable, quantized Ki-resonances that emerge as topologically protected solutions to the Pirouette Lagrangian. These "verbs of existence" represent the discrete geometries of action (e.g., Rest, Motion, Synthesize) that form the complete basis for all systemic states and interactions. Any persistent entity or process must be describable as a pure state or a superposition of states from this lexicon.

## EFT-First Summary
In Effective Field Theory, the Lexicon of Resonance corresponds to the set of stable, solitonic field configurations characterized by a quantized topological charge (`n`). These non-dissipative solutions act as the fundamental "particles" or interaction modes of the theory, with their interactions (e.g., scattering, binding) governed by the conservation of their topological numbers. All dynamic behavior in the system can be decomposed into a superposition of these fundamental modes.
