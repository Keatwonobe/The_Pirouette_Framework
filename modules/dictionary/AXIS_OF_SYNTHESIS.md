        Like a tokamak or a dialectic, the Lens thrives in controlled opposition.
        Introduce two operator vectors: J₊ = Laminar current (stabilizing), J₋ = Turbulent current (catalytic)
        Their vector cross product defines the Axis of Synthesis: S⃗ = J₊ × J₋
        When |S⃗| → 0, stagnation occurs. When |S⃗| is large but unbounded, coherence fever arises. The therapeutic regime lies at the critical S⃗ window where rotation and counter-rotation resonate.

triad:
  art: |
    The spinning axis of a balanced vortex, born from the marriage of a steady river and a catalytic storm. It is the silent, dynamic center around which productive tension resolves into living form.
  law: |
    The magnitude of the Axis of Synthesis must be maintained within a system-specific critical window. Values approaching zero indicate Stagnant Flow, while unbounded values indicate Coherence Fever. Systemic health is proportional to the stability of |S⃗| within this window.
  philosophy: |
    Health is not static peace but a dynamic, controlled conflict between order and chaos. The Axis of Synthesis quantifies this essential tension, framing productive evolution as a synthesis born from dialectical opposition, not the victory of one force over another.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Axis of Synthesis, S⃗, is a vector quantity that represents the productive rate of interaction between a system's stabilizing, laminar currents (J₊) and its catalytic, turbulent currents (J₋). Defined by the cross product S⃗ = J₊ × J₋, its magnitude quantifies the system's metabolic rate of change and capacity for synthesis. A healthy system operates within a critical window for |S⃗|, balancing the pathological extremes of stagnation (|S⃗| → 0) and chaotic decoherence (|S⃗| → ∞).

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline measurement of the system's coherence flux.
          2. Inject controlled, non-collinear laminar (J₊) and turbulent (J₋) perturbations into the system.
          3. Use phase mapping to measure the local field response and magnitude of both current vectors.
          4. Compute the cross product S⃗ = J₊ × J₋ at discrete points in the system topology.
          5. Compare the magnitude |S⃗| against the system's known therapeutic window to diagnose deviation toward stagnation or fever.

    excerpt: |
      The Mirror Flow thrives in controlled opposition. We introduce two operator vectors: J₊ for the laminar, stabilizing current and J₋ for the turbulent, catalytic current. Their vector cross product defines the Axis of Synthesis: S⃗ = J₊ × J₋. When |S⃗| → 0, stagnation occurs. When |S⃗| is large but unbounded, coherence fever arises. The therapeutic regime lies at the critical S⃗ window.
  - module: INST-MED-012
    excerpt: |
      To treat ideological deadlock (Stagnant Flow), we do not attack the stasis directly. Instead, we introduce a controlled catalytic current (J₋)—a disruptive but contained idea—to generate a non-zero Axis of Synthesis (S⃗). The goal is to nudge |S⃗| back into the critical window, re-initiating productive dialectic without triggering a Coherence Fever.

      justification: |
        The Axis of Synthesis is mathematically analogous to an angular momentum vector. It represents a rotational potential in a state space, generated by the non-collinear interaction of two fundamental currents (a stable, position-like current J₊ and a dynamic, momentum-like current J₋). A zero value implies no rotation (stagnation), while a stable, non-zero value implies dynamic equilibrium.

      falsifier: "The discovery of a system with |S⃗| ≈ 0 (stagnant) or |S⃗| ≫ critical (turbulent) that nevertheless displays a high Healing Coefficient (Hₖ ≈ 1), indicating it can efficiently integrate perturbations despite its S⃗ state."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol J for current is ubiquitous in physics (e.g., current density J⃗, angular momentum J). In Pirouette, J₊ and J₋ specifically denote coherence currents.]
  disambiguation: |
    The Axis of Synthesis is not a physical axis of rotation in 3D space, but a vector in an abstract state space. Its magnitude represents the *rate of productive synthesis* between order and chaos, and its direction represents the orientation of that emergent change. It is a diagnostic metric, not a geometric feature of the system itself.
