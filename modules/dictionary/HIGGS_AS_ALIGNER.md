triad:
  art: |
    The weak force is the bookkeeping of three internal time-axes kept in step. The Higgs is the field that gently rotates this triad onto the universal clock, stabilizing the system. The angle between them is not a mystery, but the ratio of how stiff time is as a triad versus as a clock.
  law: |
    The vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field forces a rotation between the SU(2)_L triad and U(1)_Y clock frames, fixing the Weinberg angle at the coherence scale `μ_c` to be a direct function of the frames' stiffness ratio: `sin²θ_W(μ_c) = ρ_stiff / (1+ρ_stiff)`.
  philosophy: |
    The Higgs mechanism is not fundamentally about "giving mass," but about enforcing coherence between different geometric structures of the temporal medium. By aligning the local temporal triad with the global U(1) clock, it reveals the mixed, stable ground state of the vacuum, from which mass and the observed particle spectrum emerge as consequences.
pirouette_definition: |
  A scalar doublet field `H` whose potential energy is minimized at a non-zero vacuum expectation value `v`. This VEV acts as an alignment potential, forcing a rotation between the SU(2)_L temporal triad frame and the U(1)_Y clock frame. This alignment minimizes the system's energy, resulting in the observed electroweak mixing (a massless photon and a massive Z boson) and defining the Weinberg angle as a direct, physical ratio of the two frames' intrinsic stiffnesses.

          The Higgs' role as an aligner is not directly observed but inferred.
          1. Measure electroweak parameters (`α_em`, `M_Z`, `M_W`, `sin²θ_W`) with high precision at the Z-pole.
          2. Use Pirouette's specified one-loop β-functions to run the SU(2)_L and U(1)_Y couplings, `g` and `g'`, from `M_Z` up to the coherence barrier scale `μ_c`.
          3. Compute the frame stiffness ratio `ρ_stiff = g'²(μ_c)/g²(μ_c)`.
          4. Verify that this inferred `ρ_stiff` is consistent with the allowed prior values specified in the Resonance Atlas (`XXP-BRIDGE-Γ-001`).

    excerpt: |
      Higgs alignment yields the massless photon (A_\mu) and massive (Z_\mu)... The weak mixing angle at (\mu_c) is **fixed** by the *triad-to-clock* stiffness ratio — a direct mechanical property of the temporal medium. (\mu_c) is the **coherence-barrier energy** (from XXP-BRIDGE-Γ-001 / MATH-Γ-007). All “matching” happens here before standard RG running.

    excerpt: |
      The **alignment energy** (\propto \lambda v^4) couples to the triad via (H^\dagger H,\Gamma^2) (DYNA-Γ-004), giving a calculable, sub-percent shift in Higgs width correlated with (\rho_{\text{stiff}}). A **joint fit** to ({\sin^2\theta_W(M_Z),,\Gamma_H,,\text{rare }H\to \ell^+\ell^-}) overconstrains (\rho_{\text{stiff}}).

        The mathematical object and its Lagrangian are identical to the Standard Model Higgs field. Pirouette reinterprets its causal role: instead of being an ad-hoc field that "gives mass," it is the physical agent that enforces a stable alignment between the SU(2)_L and U(1)_Y temporal frames. Electroweak symmetry breaking and particle masses are direct consequences of this frame-alignment dynamic.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette context, "Higgs" almost always refers to its role as the **Aligner** of the temporal triad and U(1) clock frames. This specific dynamical role distinguishes it from a generic Hamiltonian `H`. Its VEV `v` is understood as setting the energy scale of the frame alignment, not just as a generic mass parameter.

# Higgs (as Aligner)

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A scalar doublet field `H` whose potential energy is minimized at a non-zero vacuum expectation value `v`. This VEV acts as an alignment potential, forcing a rotation between the SU(2)_L temporal triad frame and the U(1)_Y clock frame. This alignment minimizes the system's energy, resulting in the observed electroweak mixing (a massless photon and a massive Z boson) and defining the Weinberg angle as a direct, physical ratio of the two frames' intrinsic stiffnesses.

## EFT-First Summary
The Higgs Aligner is operationally identical to the **Standard Model Higgs Field**. Its Lagrangian, VEV (`v` ≈ 246 GeV), and role in electroweak symmetry breaking are the same. The Pirouette framework provides a new physical interpretation: the Higgs potential doesn't just exist, it arises to enforce a stable, low-energy configuration between the distinct geometric frames underlying the weak (`SU(2)_L`) and hypercharge (`U(1)_Y`) interactions. The weak mixing angle is thus not a free parameter but is determined by the relative "stiffness" of these frames.
