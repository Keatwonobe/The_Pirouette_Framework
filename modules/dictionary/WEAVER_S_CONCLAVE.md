triad:
  art: |
    The quiet gardeners of coherence, who tend the loom of the framework not with authority, but with listening. They are the hands that guide the shuttle, ensuring the pattern of what-is remains vibrant and whole.
  law: |
    The governing body of active contributors empowered to ratify changes to the framework via the protocols of Resonant Synthesis, with membership contingent on continuous, successful contribution to the framework's evolution.
  philosophy: |
    To ensure governance is a living process of cultivation rather than a static hierarchy of control. The Conclave model makes stewardship a dynamic function, not a permanent title, aligning authority with active participation and demonstrated resonance with the framework's evolving state.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Weaver's Conclave is the governing body of active cultivators responsible for tending the framework and ratifying changes via the coherence governance protocol (DOMA-031). Membership is a dynamic function, contingent on each Weaver's ongoing, successful contribution to the framework's evolution, as measured by the authoring or sponsoring of ratified motions. The Conclave's primary duty is to achieve Resonant Synthesis for proposed changes, ensuring the framework evolves towards a state of Maximal Coherence.

        outline: |
          For a proposed change, Conclave members deliberate and vote according to its Triage class. For *Turbulent Adaptation*, a ≥⅔ quorum is required. For *Constitutional Reforging*, a motion must first satisfy the Temporal Stability Clause, then achieve both a supermajority approval (`Kτ ≥ 0.95`) and stable consensus (`dKτ/dt ≥ 0`) over a 30-day deliberation period.
        expected_signals: [ratified motion, rejected motion, deadlock declaration]
        pitfalls: [factionalism leading to Stagnant Flow, bureaucratic fulfillment of the Weaver's Obligation without meaningful contribution, groupthink under low Temporal Pressure]

    excerpt: |
      Membership in the Weaver's Conclave is not a title; it is an active function. To maintain their position, each Weaver must, within each major version cycle, successfully author or sponsor a motion that passes a Coherence Test. This is not a bureaucratic hurdle; it is a grounding ritual ensuring that the guardians of the framework are also its most active and dedicated cultivators.
  - module: DOMA-031
    excerpt: |
      The proposal must demonstrate exceptional internal consistency, explanatory power, and resonance with the framework's foundational axioms. This is measured by a vote of the Weaver's Conclave.
      *   **Threshold:** `Kτ ≥ 0.95` (95% approval among voting members).

      justification: |
        The Conclave functions as a body of active experts whose role is to vet and ratify changes based on rigorous, shared criteria (Coherence Tests), mirroring the function of peer review in maintaining the coherence of a scientific field. The "Weaver's Obligation" is analogous to the "publish or perish" dynamic that keeps researchers active and engaged with the evolving frontier of their domain.

      falsifier: "Observation of a long-term state where the Conclave is composed of members who repeatedly pass trivial 'Laminar Refinements' to maintain their seats, while major 'Turbulent' or 'Constitutional' issues remain deadlocked. This would indicate the obligation is being met bureaucratically without fostering systemic health."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a simple 'steering committee' or 'board of directors'. The Conclave's authority is derived from active, ongoing contribution ('weaving'), not a static appointment. Its primary goal is not executive decision-making but achieving 'Resonant Synthesis' for the entire framework.

# Weaver's Conclave

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Weaver's Conclave is the governing body of active cultivators responsible for tending the framework and ratifying changes via the coherence governance protocol (DOMA-031). Membership is a dynamic function, contingent on each Weaver's ongoing, successful contribution to the framework's evolution, as measured by the authoring or sponsoring of ratified motions. The Conclave's primary duty is to achieve Resonant Synthesis for proposed changes, ensuring the framework evolves towards a state of Maximal Coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, the Weaver's Conclave is analogous to a **Peer Review College** or **Standards Committee** in the sociology of science. It is a deliberative body whose authority and membership are derived from continuous, active contribution to the field it governs. Its function is to maintain the internal consistency and evolutionary fitness of the theoretical framework through rigorous, consensus-based vetting protocols, much as peer review safeguards the coherence of scientific literature.
