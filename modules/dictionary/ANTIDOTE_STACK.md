    A quiet harbor where the ship of self repairs its rigging after a storm. It is the structured stillness that counters chaos, the cool draft that extinguishes a fever.
  law: |
    An Antidote Stack is a set of prescribed, repeatable actions whose measured effect is the restoration of coherence potential (Kτ) and the reduction of perceived temporal pressure (Γ) following a period of applied stress. Its efficacy (ΔKτ/Δt) must be greater than that of unstructured rest over the same period.
  philosophy: |
    To endure stress without a countervailing restorative practice is to court systemic collapse. The Antidote Stack asserts that recovery is not passive but an active, structured art, essential for integrating dissonance and enabling a higher-order reconstitution of Will.
pirouette_definition: |
  A curated, protocolized set of restorative actions designed to counteract the disruptive effects of Temporal Pressure (Γ) and rebuild Coherence (Kτ). The stack typically integrates practices across physiological (e.g., nutrition, sleep), behavioral (e.g., breathwork, ritual), and cognitive (e.g., reflection, gratitude) domains. It serves as the primary mechanism for returning a system to a state of laminar flow after the application of hormetic stress in a rehabilitation or training context.

        outline: |
          1. Establish baseline Kτ and Γ measurements.
          2. Apply a known stressor (e.g., a rehabilitation exercise bout).
          3. Re-measure Kτ and Γ immediately post-stressor.
          4. Prescribe and execute the Antidote Stack protocol for a defined period (e.g., 12-24 hours).
          5. Re-measure Kτ and Γ. Efficacy is the magnitude of recovery in Kτ and reduction in Γ attributable to the stack compared to a control condition.
        expected_signals: [Increase in Kτ, decrease in Γ, stabilization of HRV, decrease in self-reported stress.]
        pitfalls: [Confounding environmental stressors, poor adherence to protocol, placebo effects.]

      justification: |
        The Antidote Stack is a set of programmed behaviors designed to actively return a system to its homeostatic set-point after a perturbation. While homeostasis is often autonomic, the Stack represents a conscious, volitional engagement in the same restorative process.

  adopted:
    - target: Negative Feedback Loop
      domain: Control Theory
      rationale: |
        This mapping is adopted for its operational precision. The Stack functions as the actuator in a negative feedback loop. The "error signal" is the deviation from desired coherence (high Γ, low Kτ) caused by a stressor. The Stack's actions are the control input designed to reduce this error and restore stability.

  claims:
    - statement: "Application of a standardized Antidote Stack (e.g., the DOMA-205A stack) following a measured dose of Γ will result in a statistically significant faster return to baseline Kτ compared to an equivalent period of passive, unstructured rest."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "A controlled trial shows no significant difference in the recovery trajectory of Kτ (dKτ/dt) between a group using the Antidote Stack and a control group engaged in unstructured rest."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The term "stack" is common in computer science. Here it refers to a layered set of interoperable protocols, not a LIFO data structure.]
  disambiguation: |
    "Antidote" implies counteracting a poison. In this context, the "poison" is not the stressor itself (which can be hormetic and beneficial), but the resulting decoherence and excess Temporal Pressure (Γ) that follows if left unbalanced.

# Antidote Stack

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A curated, protocolized set of restorative actions designed to counteract the disruptive effects of Temporal Pressure (Γ) and rebuild Coherence (Kτ). The stack typically integrates practices across physiological (e.g., nutrition, sleep), behavioral (e.g., breathwork, ritual), and cognitive (e.g., reflection, gratitude) domains. It serves as the primary mechanism for returning a system to a state of laminar flow after the application of hormetic stress in a rehabilitation or training context.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of control systems, the Antidote Stack is the actuator in a negative feedback loop designed to maintain system stability. When a stressor perturbs the system from its set-point, increasing the "error signal" (high Γ, low Kτ), the Stack's protocolized actions (nutrition, rest, breathwork) serve as the control input to drive the system back towards its coherent state (Kτ ≈ 1). This operationalizes recovery not as passive waiting, but as an active, error-correcting process.
