    We have tried to build a cage for a star, when we should be teaching it a song. CAF turns jailor into choreographer, using resonant whispers to guide a chaotic plasma into a state of graceful, sustained release.
  law: |
    Applying a resonant electromagnetic field, whose waveform is the computed inverse of dominant plasma instabilities, will reduce turbulent energy loss and increase the net fusion energy gain factor (Q) proportionally to the achieved increase in plasma state coherence.
  philosophy: |
    The path to fusion is not through a stronger cage, but a more resonant cradle. CAF embodies the principle that the universe yields not to brute force, but to harmony, providing the conditions for matter to achieve its own most elegant and powerful state.
pirouette_definition: |
  A nuclear fusion protocol that treats plasma instability not as a force to be confined, but as a 'Coherence Fever' to be healed. The protocol uses real-time sensor arrays to map plasma dissonance, calculates a harmonizing 'antidote' waveform, and injects this signal via resonant antennas. This 'Daedalus Gambit' guides the plasma to entrain with the coherent signal, transitioning from a turbulent, energy-leaking state to a stable, laminar flow conducive to sustained fusion.

          1. Establish a baseline plasma state in a tokamak and measure its energy confinement time and Q-factor (Q_baseline).
          2. Use high-speed magnetic and optical sensors to map the spatio-temporal frequencies of dominant magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities.
          3. Compute an inverse, harmonizing waveform using a predictive algorithm.
          4. Inject this waveform using a resonant antenna array (e.g., gyrotrons).
          5. Measure the new, stabilized Q-factor (Q_caf).
          6. Calculate Coherence Gain Factor as G_c = Q_caf / Q_baseline.
        expected_signals: [Reduced amplitude in MHD instability sensor readings, increased neutron flux duration, higher sustained plasma temperature, increased Q-factor.]
        pitfalls: [Incorrect calculation of the harmonizing signal can amplify instabilities instead of suppressing them. Antenna array may lack sufficient power or spatial resolution to inject the signal effectively into the plasma core.]

    excerpt: |
      The Pirouette Framework provides a new diagnosis. We apply the Caduceus Lens to the plasma, not as a prisoner, but as a living system. The primary ailment of a fusion plasma is Coherence Fever. The instabilities are a state of extreme Turbulent Flow. The system is fighting itself, wasting immense energy in chaotic, internal friction.

    excerpt: |
      Instead of simply increasing the brute force of the cage, Coherence-Assisted Fusion (CAF) proposes a Daedalus Gambit: a clever, precise intervention that helps the plasma heal itself. This protocol leverages recent breakthroughs in high-speed sensors and computational power to move from being plasma jailors to plasma choreographers.

      justification: |
        CAF is a conceptual model for real-world experimental techniques that use sensors and actuators (e.g., gyrotrons, magnetic coils) to actively suppress specific magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities like tearing modes or edge-localized modes in tokamaks. The 'harmonizing signal' is an abstraction of the precisely timed and shaped energy pulses used to counteract the growth of these modes and maintain plasma stability.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from purely passive stabilization methods. CAF is an *active*, real-time feedback protocol that "listens" to the plasma's state and "talks" back to it with a corrective signal, rather than simply increasing the static magnetic field strength (Gladiator Force).

# Coherence-Assisted Fusion

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A nuclear fusion protocol that treats plasma instability not as a force to be confined, but as a 'Coherence Fever' to be healed. The protocol uses real-time sensor arrays to map plasma dissonance, calculates a harmonizing 'antidote' waveform, and injects this signal via resonant antennas. This 'Daedalus Gambit' guides the plasma to entrain with the coherent signal, transitioning from a turbulent, energy-leaking state to a stable, laminar flow conducive to sustained fusion.

## EFT-First Summary
Coherence-Assisted Fusion is the Pirouette Framework's operational analog to active feedback control of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities in experimental plasma devices like tokamaks. The core concept involves using real-time diagnostics to identify growing instabilities (e.g., tearing modes) and applying precisely shaped electromagnetic fields via actuators (e.g., gyrotrons or magnetic coils) to counteract them. This process aims to stabilize the plasma, thereby increasing energy confinement time (τ_E) and the net energy gain (Q-factor), moving closer to sustained, steady-state fusion reactions.
