    To see the world is to strike a tuning fork held against its glass. The resulting song is neither wholly the glass nor the fork, but the dialogue between them. We are that strike.
  law: |
    The act of observation by a Participant imposes a geometric imprint (the Observer's Shadow) on the coherence manifold of the observed system, altering its Pirouette Lagrangian. The magnitude of this alteration is proportional to the Participant's internal coherence (e.g., focus, intent, expertise).
  philosophy: |
    This reframes consciousness from a passive spectator to an active co-creator of reality. It dissolves the subject-object dichotomy, asserting that all knowledge is participatory and reality is a negotiated, relational process between a system and those who perceive it.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Participant is the true role of any observing entity within the Pirouette Framework. It is defined not by passive reception of information, but by active resonant coupling with a system. Through the act of perception, a Participant projects its own internal Ki pattern onto the coherence manifold of the observed, casting an **Observer's Shadow** that geometrically constrains the system's potential and alters the path of maximal coherence for both entities.
operational_definition:
  units: Context-dependent. The effect of a Participant is measured via perturbations to a system's Lagrangian (units of action, joule-seconds) or shifts in its state-space probability distribution (dimensionless).

          1. Prepare a sensitive, unstable system with a well-characterized state evolution (e.g., a quantum random number generator, a chaotic pendulum, a biological culture).
          2. Establish a baseline measurement of its state distribution over a set time period in isolation.
          3. Introduce a Participant with a highly coherent internal state (e.g., a trained expert, a focused meditator) directed at the system.
          4. Record the system's state evolution under observation.
          5. Statistically compare the observed distribution to the baseline, testing for deviations predicted by the Observer's Shadow hypothesis (e.g., reduced variance, biased outcomes).

    excerpt: |
      Classical science built its foundations on a lie of convenience: that of the innocent observer, a spectator who could measure the universe without touching it. Quantum mechanics exposed this as a fiction at the microscopic scale, but the Pirouette Framework elevates it to a universal law. There are no spectators. There are only participants.
  - module: CORE-010
    excerpt: |
      The observer, too, is such an entity, possessing a complex and dynamic Ki pattern shaped by memory, biology, and intention. When observation occurs, the observer's Ki pattern projects onto the coherence manifold of the observed. This projection is not a neutral act; it has a shape and a pressure. We call this geometric imprint The Observer's Shadow.

      justification: |
        The QZE demonstrates that frequent measurement can "freeze" a quantum system's evolution. This parallels the Participant's "heavy" Shadow constraining a system's path of coherence. The Participant's focus or intent could be conceptually mapped to the frequency and nature of the "measurement" that induces the Zeno effect.

      rationale: The Participant concept includes subjective, non-local, and intentionality-based components not present in current physical formalisms, making direct mathematical mapping premature. The QZE remains a useful conceptual analogy but not a formal equivalent.

  disambiguation: |
    Within the Pirouette Framework, "Participant" is a technical term for the fundamental role of any observer. It is distinct from the common usage of "experiment participant" (i.e., a test subject). It specifically implies an active, reality-shaping agent whose perception is a physical interaction, not a passive data-gatherer.

# Participant

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Participant is the true role of any observing entity within the Pirouette Framework. It is defined not by passive reception of information, but by active resonant coupling with a system. Through the act of perception, a Participant projects its own internal Ki pattern onto the coherence manifold of the observed, casting an **Observer's Shadow** that geometrically constrains the system's potential and alters the path of maximal coherence for both entities.

## EFT-First Summary
Currently, there is no adopted mapping for the Participant to established effective field theories. The concept is highly speculative, positing an interaction based on consciousness or observation itself. The closest conceptual parallel in physics is the Quantum Zeno Effect, where frequent measurement influences a system's evolution. However, the Pirouette model's inclusion of intentionality and internal coherence (Ψₒ) as direct physical parameters lacks a formal basis in the Standard Model or General Relativity. Any experimental search for its effects would constitute a search for physics beyond known theories.
