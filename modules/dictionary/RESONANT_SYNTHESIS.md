    A gardener grafts a foreign branch onto a healthy tree, risking the host's integrity for the promise of a new, more resilient fruit.
  law: |
    A system initiates Resonant Synthesis if and only if the predicted Dissonance Index (ΔK) of an inbound signal is below its calibrated Integrity Threshold, indicating a probable net increase in systemic coherence (`∫(K_τ - V_Γ)dt > 0`).
  philosophy: |
    Synthesis is the primary mechanism for growth and evolution within the framework. It posits that coherence is not a static state to be defended, but a dynamic process that thrives on selective, harmonious integration with novelty, transforming external dissonance into internal complexity.
pirouette_definition: |
  The process of intentionally coupling with an external system or signal to achieve a new, higher-order state of coherence. It is an energetic investment, voluntarily increasing local Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) in a gambit to achieve an Alchemical Union, thereby maximizing the system's integrated coherence (`S_p`) over time. This action is undertaken only when the predicted Dissonance Index of the interaction is low, indicating a high probability of success.

        outline: |
          1. Scan the resonant signature of an inbound signal (Phase Mismatch, Dissonance Spike, Coherence Attack properties).
          2. Compute the Dissonance Index (ΔK) relative to the system's own coherence parameters.
          3. Compare ΔK to the system's pre-calibrated Integrity Threshold.
          4. If ΔK is below the threshold, initiate coupling (Resonant Synthesis).
          5. Post-coupling, measure the change in the system's net Temporal Coherence (K_τ) to quantify the success or failure of the synthesis.

      The Sentry's Gambit is not a defense mechanism; it is an act of profound discernment. It is a form of **Resonant Triage**, the wisdom to know which harmonies are worth pursuing and which dissonances are best left unsounded. It provides a formal process...for predicting the outcome of a potential interaction.

        Resonant Synthesis describes the coupling of two systems (signals) where their phase alignment and frequency compatibility lead to a new state with an amplitude (coherence) greater than the sum of its parts. This is directly analogous to constructive interference, where waves in phase combine to create a wave of greater amplitude.

# Resonant Synthesis

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The process of intentionally coupling with an external system or signal to achieve a new, higher-order state of coherence. It is an energetic investment, voluntarily increasing local Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) in a gambit to achieve an Alchemical Union, thereby maximizing the system's integrated coherence (`S_p`) over time. This action is undertaken only when the predicted Dissonance Index of the interaction is low, indicating a high probability of success.

## EFT-First Summary
Resonant Synthesis is conceptually mapped to **Constructive Interference** in classical mechanics. Just as in-phase waves combine to produce a wave of greater amplitude, two systems with low Dissonance (high phase/frequency compatibility) can couple to form a new, composite system with a higher state of net coherence. The Dissonance Index acts as a predictive measure of phase mismatch, determining whether the interaction will lead to constructive (synthesis) or destructive (coherence erosion) interference.
