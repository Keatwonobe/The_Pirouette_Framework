    The potential V(Γ) has exactly three stable minima (bound states) for the current cosmological Hubble parameter (H₀), dynamically limiting the number of fermion generations to three.

    The potential replaces arbitrary parameter counting with a dynamical principle of stability. The number of generations is not a coincidence but a necessary consequence of the universe's temporal dynamics, explaining *why* there are three families of matter.

        outline: |
          The shape of V(Γ) is inferred indirectly. It is constrained by solving the dynamical equation for the Γ-field, including the cosmological damping term (proportional to H), and requiring that the equation yields exactly three stable, bound-state solutions. The potential's functional form is thus fixed by the observed number of generations and cosmological parameters like H₀.

      The temporal-pressure potential (V(Γ)) supports only **three stable nodes** before resonance blow-up at (Γ=Γ_c), preventing a fourth generation.

# Temporal-pressure potential

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The potential energy function V(Γ) governing the dynamics of the global Γ-field. Its stable minima, or nodes, correspond to the quantized standing-wave modes that manifest as fermion generations. The potential's structure, governed by cosmological damping, allows for exactly three stable nodes, thereby providing a dynamical explanation for the existence of precisely three generations of matter.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of Effective Field Theory, the Temporal-pressure potential V(Γ) is the scalar potential for the Γ-field. Its primary role is to dynamically set the number of stable field modes, which manifest physically as fermion generations. Unlike a typical Higgs potential with a single non-trivial vacuum, V(Γ) is structured by cosmological damping to possess exactly three minima, explaining the three-generation structure of the Standard Model as a consequence of dynamical stability.
