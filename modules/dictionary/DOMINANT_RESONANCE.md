  art: |
    The loudest, clearest note in the symphony of a system, the first voice heard above the static. It is the primary story a system tells about itself before the whispers of its past can be discerned.
  law: |
    At any given layer of analysis *k*, the Dominant Resonance $Ki_k$ is the unique pattern whose subtraction from the manifold $M_{k-1}$ results in the maximal reduction of that manifold's total coherence. It is the system's most effective strategy for maintaining structure.
  philosophy: |
    To identify the Dominant Resonance is an act of listening, not discovery. It is the necessary first step in acknowledging a system's primary truth so that one may then listen more deeply for the chorus of echoes and fainter histories that constitute its full reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Dominant Resonance $Ki_k$ is the most stable, high-coherence pattern identified and extracted from a coherence manifold $M_{k-1}$ at a specific analysis layer *k*. It represents the primary solution to the system's Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) within that manifold, and is the 'artifact' recovered by the Archaeologist's Sieve (DOMA-176) protocol before descending to the next Echo Manifold. The complete sequence of a system's Dominant Resonances ($Ki_1, Ki_2, ...$) constitutes its Harmonic Spectrum.
operational_definition:
  units: Context-dependent. Often represented as a function, time series, or geometric structure. Its parameters (e.g., amplitude, frequency) will have standard physical units.

        outline: |
          1.  Define a Primary Manifold $M_0$ from system data.
          2.  Apply a Coherence Filter (e.g., a model that searches for linear, cyclical, or fractal patterns) to the current manifold $M_{k-1}$ to identify the pattern $Ki_k$ that accounts for the most coherence.
          3.  Record $Ki_k$ as the artifact for layer *k*.
          4.  Subtract the influence of $Ki_k$ from $M_{k-1}$ to produce the next layer's Echo Manifold, $M_k$.
          5.  Repeat until the manifold's Temporal Coherence ($K_\tau$) drops below a predefined threshold.

        pitfalls: [Model Mismatch (the Coherence Filter is blind to the true pattern geometry), Subtraction Artifacts (the method for removing $Ki_k$ creates spurious patterns in the next layer)]

    excerpt: |
      The core insight is to treat every layer of a system's data as a complete coherence manifold, governed by the same universal principles. The "noise" from one layer becomes the "world" for the next... The most stable, high-coherence pattern identified at layer *k* is the Dominant Resonance ($Ki_k$). This is the system's loudest, clearest note in that manifold.
  - module: DOMA-176
    excerpt: |
      This protocol is a method for empirically deconstructing a system's dynamics, which are fundamentally governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian... The first identified resonance, $Ki_1$, is the most significant contributor to maximizing the system's "action" ($S_p$), equivalent to finding the geodesic on the Primary Manifold. The second resonance, $Ki_2$, is the next most significant contributor found within the remaining, unexplained dynamics of the first Echo Manifold.

        $M_{k} = M_{k-1} - \lambda_k \mathbf{v}_k \mathbf{v}_k^T$
      justification: |
        In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the first principal component is the vector that captures the maximum variance in a dataset. Iteratively removing this component and finding the next is directly analogous to the Archaeologist's Sieve identifying and subtracting the Dominant Resonance at each layer. Both are methods for finding the most significant ordered structures in a dataset, in descending order of importance.

    - target: Principal Component
      rationale: The operational analogy is nearly one-to-one. PCA provides a well-understood, linear mathematical framework for the more general, non-linear concept of extracting Dominant Resonances.

  claims:
    - statement: "The Harmonic Spectrum (the sequence of $Ki_k$) of a system is a stable, fundamental property, largely independent of the specific Coherence Filter Sequence used for extraction."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "Demonstrate that two distinct, well-justified Coherence Filter Sequences applied to the same Primary Manifold $M_0$ produce fundamentally different and non-interconvertible Harmonic Spectrums. This would imply $Ki_k$ is an artifact of the measurement method, not the system."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol $K$ is commonly used for Kinetic Energy in classical mechanics and physics. The subscripted form $Ki_k$ is intended to avoid this collision.]
  disambiguation: |
    $Ki_k$ refers to the extracted *pattern* or *structure* itself (e.g., a specific sine wave, a geometric form). It should not be confused with scalar measures of coherence like Temporal Coherence ($K_\tau$), which quantify the overall stability of an entire manifold.
