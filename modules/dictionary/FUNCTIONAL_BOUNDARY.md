      snippet: |
        Given a transformation region Ω with smooth, finite entropy flux ∇S, Algorithm B₁ selects a functional boundary ∂Ωₜ that minimises the Residue R=S_in−S_out over a residence time T_res ≥ 2τ_dominant.

  art: |
    A self-drawn line in the sand of flux, the quiet membrane where a system decides what it is and what is mere weather. It is the surface of least regret.
  law: |
    The functional boundary ∂Ωₜ is the unique surface Σ that locally extremizes the entropy flux functional J[Σ]=∫_Σ |∇S|dA (i.e., δJ/δn=0) and minimizes the time-integrated Residue R over a period T_res ≥ 2τ_dominant.
  philosophy: |
    The Functional Boundary provides a non-arbitrary method for delineating a system from its environment. It defines the minimal surface required for a transformation to maintain coherence, thus separating essential process from external entropic noise.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Functional Boundary ∂Ωₜ is the unique, time-dependent surface of a transformation region Ω selected by Algorithm B₁ to minimize the Residue R (net entropy production). The boundary is determined by finding the surface Σ where the area-weighted entropy flux is stationary (δJ/δn=0), effectively isolating the transformation from high-frequency environmental noise over a characteristic residence time.

        outline: |
          1. Define a transformation region Ω and measure or model the entropy flux field ∇S(x, t) within it.
          2. Numerically solve for a candidate surface Σ where the functional J[Σ]=∫_Σ |∇S|dA is stationary (δJ/δn=0).
          3. Integrate the net flux across Σ over a time window T_res ≥ 2τ_dominant to calculate the Residue R.
          4. Iterate step 2 to find the surface that globally minimizes R.

    excerpt: |
      At any candidate surface Σ, define the functional J[Σ]=∫_Σ |∇S|dA. By B₁, we choose Σ such that the directional derivative δJ/δn=0. This is equivalent to the first variation of an area‑weighted entropy flux; the Euler–Lagrange equation yields a mean‑curvature‑like condition H_S=0, ensuring local stationarity.
  - module: XAP-002_appendix_addendum_014_016
    excerpt: |
      Suppose two disjoint surfaces Σ₁, Σ₂ satisfy B₁; construct composite surface Σ′=Σ₁∪Σ₂. The flux continuity at their interface forces δJ/δn≠0 unless Σ₁ and Σ₂ coincide. Therefore the extremal R is unique.

      justification: |
        The selection criterion for ∂Ωₜ, minimizing a surface functional via its first variation (δJ/δn=0), is mathematically analogous to the definition of a minimal surface in differential geometry. The source text explicitly notes the resulting Euler-Lagrange equation yields a "mean-curvature-like condition," suggesting ∂Ωₜ is a minimal surface in a metric space defined by the local entropy flux.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a simple geometric or administrative boundary. The Functional Boundary is not imposed but *emerges* from the dynamics of the entropy flux field. It is the boundary of a *process*, not necessarily a static object, and is therefore time-dependent (∂Ωₜ).
