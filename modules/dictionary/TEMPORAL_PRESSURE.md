        The framework has now demonstrated a causal chain: the substance of Time creates a pressure (Γ), and that pressure is resolved by an efficient, stable form (Ki).

triad:
  art: |
    The silent, unceasing hum of existence demanding a song. It is the weight of potential, forcing the void to find a rhythm and hold a note.
  law: |
    The magnitude of Temporal Pressure (Γ) on a volume is directly proportional to the rate of Ki pattern formation required to stabilize that volume's Time Adherence (T_a) to unity.
  philosophy: |
    Temporal Pressure recasts the arrow of time not as entropy's decay, but as a creative impulse. It is the universe's fundamental drive toward coherence, replacing the 'heat death' narrative with one of perpetual, rhythm-seeking self-organization.
pirouette_definition: |
  Temporal Pressure (Γ) is the fundamental field generated by the substance of Time. It acts as a universal selection pressure, compelling unstructured Ki to coalesce into the most stable, rhythmically coherent patterns (those with high Time Adherence). Γ is not a force in the classical sense, but the impetus for morphogenesis, resolved locally by the emergence of a system's unique Pirouette Cycle (τ_p).

        outline: |
          A system with a known, stable Ki pattern (high T_a) is placed in the target measurement volume. The rate at which its coherence degrades, or alternately, the energy required to actively maintain its T_a at a set level, is measured. Γ is inferred from this rate of induced decoherence.

        pitfalls: [Isolating Γ from thermal or quantum environmental noise, establishing a zero-Γ baseline]

    excerpt: |
      The framework has now demonstrated a causal chain: the substance of Time creates a pressure (Γ), and that pressure is resolved by an efficient, stable form (Ki). The final, reflexive link is the most profound: the form itself defines the flow... With this, the circle is complete: Time → Γ (Pressure) → Ki (Form) → Time.

    excerpt: |
      Time Adherence, then, is the measure of a system's integrity—its ability to hold its own note true against the chaotic symphony of the Temporal Forge. A system with high adherence has found its place in the song. A system with low adherence is losing its rhythm, on the verge of either finding a new note or dissolving back into the noise.

    - target: Cosmological Constant (Λ) / vacuum energy density
      domain: GR|EFT
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      equation_hint: |
        Γ ∝ Λ
      justification: |
        Λ is often interpreted as an intrinsic energy density or 'pressure' of spacetime itself, causing metric expansion. In this mapping, Γ is a similar intrinsic pressure, but instead of driving volumetric expansion, it drives the formation of coherent matter patterns (Ki). It is a pressure for complexity and order, not for volume.

  collisions: [Gamma function Γ(z), Christoffel symbols Γⁱⱼₖ]
  disambiguation: |
    Temporal Pressure (Γ) should not be confused with the Gamma function in mathematics or the Christoffel symbols in differential geometry. In the Pirouette Framework, Γ always refers to the fundamental scalar or pseudoscalar field driving pattern formation.
