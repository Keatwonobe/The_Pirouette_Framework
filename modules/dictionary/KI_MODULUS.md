  art: |
    The amplitude of the internal field, |Ki|, gains substance by coupling to the deep, steady hum of the temporal substrate (Γ₀). It is the ghost that puts on the flesh of mass by listening to the metronome of existence.
  law: |
    The vacuum expectation value `v` of the Ki Modulus is determined by the equilibrium substrate stiffness `Γ₀` via the relation `v = √ξ Γ₀`. Consequently, all particle masses derived from this VEV are directly and measurably proportional to `Γ₀`.
  philosophy: |
    The Ki Modulus acts as a transducer, converting the abstract geometric stiffness of the temporal substrate into the concrete property of particle mass. This recasts the Higgs mechanism not as an independent field, but as an emergent consequence of the substrate's dynamics, unifying mass with temporal geometry.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Ki Modulus, denoted |Ki|, is a real scalar order parameter corresponding to the amplitude of the complex internal field `Ki`. Its dynamics are governed by a coupling to the temporal substrate field Γ. The vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the modulus is not intrinsic but is set by the VEV of the substrate, `v = √ξ Γ₀`. This non-zero VEV spontaneously breaks the gauge symmetry of the parent `Ki` field, generating mass for gauge bosons, fermions, and for its own quantum excitation, the Higgs-like scalar `H = |Ki| - v`.

      - name: Indirect Inference from Particle Masses
        outline: |
          1. Measure the mass of the W gauge boson, `m_W`, and its coupling constant, `g_W`.
          2. Calculate the Ki Modulus VEV `v` using the established relation `m_W = g_W v / 2`.
          3. Measure the mass of the scalar resonance, `m_H`.
          4. From these, infer the fundamental coupling `λ_Γ` via the relation `m_H² = 4λ_Γ v²`. The set {`v`, `λ_Γ`} operationally defines the Ki Modulus sector.
        expected_signals: [A scalar resonance at `m_H ≈ 125 GeV`, vector bosons with masses proportional to `v`.]
        pitfalls: [Assuming `Γ₀` is a universal constant; it may have small spatiotemporal variations, leading to minute shifts in `v` and all derived masses.]

    excerpt: |
      The modulus of Ki couples to Γ through a mixed potential term
      $V_{\text{int}}(|Ki|,\Gamma) =\lambda_\Gamma\!\left(|Ki|^2-\xi\,\Gamma^2\right)^{\!2}.$
      Minimizing $V_{\text{int}}$ yields the equilibrium condition $|Ki|^2=\xi\,\Gamma^2$.
      Expanding around $\Gamma_0$ defines the **Higgs-like field**
      $H = |Ki|-v, \quad v=\sqrt{\xi}\,\Gamma_0$.
  - module: XAP-006C
    excerpt: |
      After symmetry breaking, the kinetic term $|D_\mu Ki|^2$ yields vector boson masses
      $m_A^2 = g_N^2\,v^2 = g_N^2\,\xi\,\Gamma_0^2$.
      Hence the ratio $\frac{m_A}{m_H} = \frac{g_N}{2\sqrt{\lambda_\Gamma}}$ is fixed by geometry and replaces the ad-hoc Higgs coupling of the Standard Model.
  - module: XAP-006C
    excerpt: |
      Let $\Gamma_0$ be the coherence density corresponding to $T_a^{-1}\!\sim\!10^{-25}\,$s. Then $\Gamma_0\approx 250$ GeV in natural units, giving:
      $m_H \approx 2\sqrt{\lambda_\Gamma}\,250\,\text{GeV},\qquad m_W \approx g_W\,250\,\text{GeV}.$
      For $\lambda_\Gamma\!\approx\!0.13$, $g_W\!\approx\!0.65$, the observed $m_H\!\approx\!125\,\text{GeV},\; m_W\!\approx\!80\,\text{GeV}$ are reproduced.

      justification: |
        The Ki Modulus is a scalar order parameter whose vacuum expectation value `v` breaks electroweak symmetry and generates masses for W/Z bosons, fermions, and a massive scalar excitation `H`. This is operationally identical to the role of the Standard Model Higgs field. The key distinction lies in the origin of the VEV, which in Pirouette is derived from the substrate stiffness `Γ₀` rather than from a self-interaction term like `μ²|Φ|² - λ|Φ|⁴`.

    Distinguish the full complex field `Ki` from its modulus `|Ki|`. The modulus `|Ki|` is the real scalar order parameter responsible for mass generation. Its quantum excitation is the Higgs-like boson `H`. The phase of the `Ki` field corresponds to the Goldstone bosons which are absorbed to give mass to the gauge fields.

# Ki Modulus

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Ki Modulus, denoted |Ki|, is a real scalar order parameter corresponding to the amplitude of the complex internal field `Ki`. Its dynamics are governed by a coupling to the temporal substrate field Γ. The vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the modulus is not intrinsic but is set by the VEV of the substrate, `v = √ξ Γ₀`. This non-zero VEV spontaneously breaks the gauge symmetry of the parent `Ki` field, generating mass for gauge bosons, fermions, and for its own quantum excitation, the Higgs-like scalar `H = |Ki| - v`.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Ki Modulus functions as the Standard Model Higgs field. Its vacuum expectation value `v` is measured to be ~246 GeV and is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. Unlike the SM, however, this VEV is not set by an ad-hoc potential but is dynamically generated by the stiffness `Γ₀` of the temporal substrate. The physical excitation of the modulus, `H`, corresponds to the observed Higgs boson at ~125 GeV.
