    It is the measure of how perfectly a system has woven itself into its resonant form, a score for the frozen music of its own survival.
  law: |
    Manifold Coherence is a dimensionless scalar between 0 and 1, calculated as the normalized volumetric dot product of a system's inferred Ki manifold and an ideal gyroidal reference manifold. A value approaching 1.0 indicates a state of maximal structural integrity and Laminar Flow.
  philosophy: |
    This metric matters because it transforms a complex geometric reconstruction into a simple, actionable diagnostic of system health. It posits that form is function; a system that deviates from its ideal, coherent geometry is a system actively losing its battle against temporal pressure.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dimensionless diagnostic metric, `Kτ_manifold`, that quantifies the structural fidelity of a system's inferred resonant geometry (Ki) to a perfect mathematical gyroid. It serves as a primary indicator of systemic health, where values approaching 1.0 signify a stable, high-coherence state (Laminar Flow), and lower or decreasing values indicate internal damage, instability (Turbulent Flow), or progressive Coherence Erosion.

          1. Acquire sparse 2D observational slices of the system (e.g., magnetograms, micro-CT).

          3. Generate an ideal gyroid reference manifold (`ψ_gyroid`) with the same periodicity and phase as the inferred manifold.
          4. Compute the normalized volumetric dot product over the integration volume V:
             `Kτ_manifold = (1/V) ∫ (ψ_inferred · ψ_gyroid) dV`

    excerpt: |
      It is founded on a key insight: under pressure, many complex systems—from plasma instabilities to biological tissues—naturally organize into a gyroid geometry. This is not an accident; the gyroid is one of nature's most elegant solutions to the problem of maximizing coherence. This tool transforms tomographic reconstruction from a simple act of stacking images into a profound act of inferring a system's chosen solution for existence.

        Like R-squared, `Kτ_manifold` acts as a "goodness-of-fit" metric, quantifying how well a model (the ideal gyroid) explains the observed data (the reconstructed manifold). While the calculation method differs, both produce a scalar in a similar range [0,1] indicating the degree of correspondence.

# Manifold Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Manifold Coherence is a dimensionless diagnostic metric, `Kτ_manifold`, that quantifies the structural fidelity of a system's inferred resonant geometry (Ki) to a perfect mathematical gyroid. It serves as a primary indicator of systemic health, where values approaching 1.0 signify a stable, high-coherence state (Laminar Flow), and lower or decreasing values indicate internal damage, instability (Turbulent Flow), or progressive Coherence Erosion. It is the primary output metric of the Gyroid Loom reconstruction protocol.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, `Kτ_manifold` is a spatial correlation coefficient. It measures the "goodness-of-fit" between an empirically reconstructed 3D field (the system's inferred geometry) and an ideal theoretical template (a perfect gyroid). This provides a single scalar value indicating how well the system's structure matches the form predicted by the Principle of Maximal Coherence. A high correlation suggests the system is in a stable, low-energy state, while a low correlation indicates stress, damage, or a departure from the gyroidal solution.
