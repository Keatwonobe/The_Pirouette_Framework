  art: |
    Like riverbeds carved by a persistent current, Coherence Geodesics are the channels of least resistance that give form and stability to a system's flow. They are the memory of a successful resonance written into the structure of reality.
  law: |
    A system's structural integrity is directly proportional to the laminar flow capacity of its critical Coherence Geodesics. Any increase in turbulence (Fever) or stagnation (Atrophy) within a geodesic is a direct predictor of impending structural failure.
  philosophy: |
    This reframes structural design from assembling static parts to carving durable channels for reality to flow through. Resilience becomes an emergent property of efficient geometry, not just material strength, making stability a function of elegant design rather than brute force.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Coherence Geodesic is a stable, energetically favorable pathway for the flow of coherence (e.g., energy, information, load) through a system. These channels are established by the system's `Architecture of Coherence` as a long-term solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian, representing the path of least resistance that maximizes Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) by efficiently channeling ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). The health and integrity of these geodesics determine the overall stability, efficiency, and resilience of the system.

        outline: |
          1.  **Map Currents:** Identify the critical flows of coherence the system architecture is designed to channel (e.g., mechanical stress, data traffic, resource allocation).
          2.  **Diagnose Flow:** Characterize the flow within each geodesic to detect the three primary pathologies defined in DOMA-189: Atrophy (blockage/stagnation), Fever (turbulence/dissonance), or Erosion (signal decay/integrity loss).
          3.  **Locate Fracture:** Trace the diagnosed pathology back to its geometric source within the architecture—a weak component, a missing link, or a resonant mismatch.
        expected_signals: [Laminar flow, high signal-to-noise ratio, low latency in coherence transfer.]

    excerpt: |
      A system's structure is not its static arrangement of parts, but the persistent, standing wave of coherence that flows through it. This wave is sustained by a deeply carved Ki pattern—its chosen architecture. The function of this architecture is to create stable channels, or geodesics, for the flow of coherence (energy, information, physical load) through the landscape of ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).
  - module: DOMA-189
    excerpt: |
      The connections between components are not mere links, but channels. A well-designed structure creates paths of least resistance, riverbeds carved to guide the water. Their purpose is to foster Laminar Flow (`DYNA-001`), ensuring that energy and information move through the system with maximum efficiency and minimal friction.

        In General Relativity, a geodesic is the path of least action for a particle in curved spacetime. A Coherence Geodesic is a direct conceptual analogue: it is the path of least resistance (and thus maximal coherence) for a "flow" of coherence through the "spacetime" whose curvature is defined by a system's architecture and the ambient Temporal Pressure.

    While directly inspired by the geodesics of General Relativity (paths of least action in curved spacetime), Coherence Geodesics are not limited to physical space. They describe optimal pathways for any form of coherence—information, trust, resources, mechanical load—through the abstract, high-dimensional landscape of a system's architecture.

# Coherence Geodesics

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Coherence Geodesic is a stable, energetically favorable pathway for the flow of coherence (e.g., energy, information, load) through a system. These channels are established by the system's `Architecture of Coherence` as a long-term solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian, representing the path of least resistance that maximizes Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) by efficiently channeling ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). The health and integrity of these geodesics determine the overall stability, efficiency, and resilience of the system.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Coherence Geodesics are analogous to the geodesics of General Relativity. Just as a test particle follows the "straightest possible path" through a curved spacetime, a unit of coherence (information, energy, etc.) will follow the path of least resistance through the "landscape" defined by a system's architecture. A well-designed system creates clear, stable geodesics, allowing for efficient, laminar flow and high resilience. Structural failure occurs when these paths become blocked, turbulent, or degraded, forcing coherence into higher-resistance, unstable configurations.
