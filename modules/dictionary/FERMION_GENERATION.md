  art: |
    Generations are not coincidences but octaves in the song of time. The electron, muon, and tau are the first three notes of a chord struck upon the temporal field, their masses the volumes of resonance.
  law: |
    The masses of successive fermion generations scale quadratically with their generation number `n`. The mass ratio between adjacent generations is `m_{n+1} / m_n ≈ ((n+1)/n)^2`, subject to small, predictable logarithmic corrections from Higgs coupling.
  philosophy: |
    Flavor is not an arbitrary property but a necessary consequence of quantized temporal dynamics. The existence of three discrete families of matter reveals a fundamental harmonic structure in the substrate of reality, replacing arbitrary parameters with a principle of resonance.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable family of matter corresponding to a principal harmonic mode (`n=1,2,3`) of a standing wave in the temporal (Γ) field. Its mass is quantized, scaling quadratically with its mode number `n`, and its stability is determined by the global properties of the temporal substrate, which permit exactly three bound states.

        outline: |
          1. Measure the pole masses of the three generations of charged leptons (electron, muon, tau).
          2. Calculate the mass ratios `m_2/m_1` and `m_3/m_1`.
          3. Compare these ratios against the theoretical prediction `m_n/m_1 = n^2(1+ε_n)`, where `ε_n` is the logarithmic damping correction.
        expected_signals: [Mass ratios scaling near `m_1:m_2:m_3 ≈ 1:4:9` before corrections, Logarithmic deviations from pure quadratic scaling consistent with Higgs coupling `λ_HΓ`]
        pitfalls: [Quark masses are scale-dependent (running masses) and difficult to define precisely, complicating direct ratio tests. Neutrino mass measurements are currently not precise enough for this test.]

    excerpt: |
      To explain the **existence of three fermion generations** and their enormous mass ratios within Pirouette’s temporal-resonance framework. Instead of arbitrary Yukawa couplings, flavor arises from **quantized standing-wave modes of the Γ-field** embedded in the temporal substrate. Each generation corresponds to a discrete harmonic of temporal curvature, producing predictable mass ratios and stable generational families.
  - module: MATH-Γ-006
    excerpt: |
      Because mass reflects temporal curvature (`m ∝ ω_n^2 / Γ_c`), the generational mass ratios follow `m_{n+1}/m_n = ((n+1)/n)^2`. Introducing small coherence-damping corrections... generates hierarchical scaling consistent with observed lepton masses when `m_1 ≈ 0.511 MeV`... `m_2 ≃ 105.7 MeV`, `m_3 ≃ 1.78 GeV`.
  - module: MATH-Γ-006
    excerpt: |
      The temporal-pressure potential `V(Γ)` supports only **three stable nodes** before resonance blow-up at `Γ=Γ_c`, preventing a fourth generation. Numerically, stability analysis of the wave equation with damping term `(3HΓ̇)` yields exactly three bound states for the current cosmological `H_0`, mirroring the observed number of families.

      justification: |
        Pirouette's harmonic mode number `n` derives the fermion mass hierarchy, replacing the Standard Model's `3x3` matrix of arbitrary Yukawa coupling parameters with a single fundamental mass scale (`m_1`) and a predictive harmonic law. It provides a physical origin for the observed hierarchical values of the couplings.

  disambiguation: |
    "Fermion Generation" refers to the complete set of particles in a given family (e.g., the first generation is the electron, electron neutrino, up quark, down quark). The "Generation Number" (`n`) is the integer quantum number (1, 2, or 3) of the underlying temporal harmonic mode that defines the entire family.
