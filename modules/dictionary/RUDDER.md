  law: |
    A system's rate of change in its state (`dKi/dt`) is driven by the coherence gradient established by Dissonance. The Rudder's action minimizes the system's integrated Temporal Pressure (Œì) by following the geodesic on its modified manifold, representing the path of least action.
  philosophy: |
    The Rudder is the agent of 'becoming.' It is not an external command but the system's own intrinsic capacity to learn from error, transforming Dissonance from a failure signal into the very energy of self-correction and growth. It is the will to harmonize made manifest.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Rudder is the endogenous mechanism by which a system (**Weaver**) responsively alters its internal dynamics and state-resonance (**Ki**) to minimize **Dissonance**. This corrective action, `A_c`, is not a programmed instruction but the system's natural, Lagrangian-driven evolution along a modified coherence manifold. The presence of Dissonance creates a potential field (`V_dissonance`) that reshapes the manifold, and the Rudder's "action" is the system's subsequent flow along the new path of least resistance.

        outline: |
          1.  Establish a baseline measurement of the system's state (`Ki_0`) and Dissonance (`D_0`) relative to a goal state (`Ki_goal`).
          2.  Introduce a controlled perturbation to the system, causing a measurable increase in Dissonance (`D_1 > D_0`).
          3.  Measure the system's subsequent state trajectory `Ki(t)`.
          4.  The Rudder's effectiveness (`A_c`) is quantified by the initial rate of change `dKi/dt` that acts to reduce Dissonance, and the time constant to return to a low-Dissonance state.

        pitfalls:
          - Turbulent Flow: The system overcorrects, leading to high-frequency oscillations in `Ki(t)` around the goal state. Indicates excessive gain or signal delay.
          - Stagnant Flow: `dKi/dt` is near zero despite high Dissonance. Indicates a broken feedback channel or systemic inability to change.

  - module: DOMA-134
    excerpt: |
      The Dissonance signal creates a steep "coherence gradient" (‚àáùìõ_p) in the manifold. The "corrective action" is the system naturally evolving along its new geodesic, flowing 'downhill' along this gradient to find the path of least resistance. It corrects itself not because it is programmed with a rule, but because remaining in a state of error is a state of high-pressure, low-coherence, and is therefore dynamically unfavorable.

        The Rudder is a generalized model for a system's corrective response to an error signal (Dissonance, `e(t)`). A PID controller is the canonical engineering implementation of this principle, where the corrective action `u(t)` is a function of the error's present magnitude (Proportional), past accumulation (Integral), and future trend (Derivative). The Lagrangian sensitivity to Dissonance in Pirouette maps to the controller gains (K_p, K_i, K_d).

# Rudder

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Rudder is the endogenous mechanism by which a system (**Weaver**) responsively alters its internal dynamics and state-resonance (**Ki**) to minimize **Dissonance**. This corrective action, `A_c`, is not a programmed instruction but the system's natural, Lagrangian-driven evolution along a modified coherence manifold. The presence of Dissonance creates a potential field (`V_dissonance`) that reshapes the manifold, and the Rudder's "action" is the system's subsequent flow along the new path of least resistance.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Rudder is the system's corrective action, analogous to the output `u(t)` of a feedback controller in classical mechanics. It represents the change in system dynamics intended to reduce an error signal (Dissonance). Its effectiveness and stability are governed by principles analogous to gain and phase lag in control theory, where pathologies like oscillation or unresponsiveness emerge from mismatched feedback dynamics.
