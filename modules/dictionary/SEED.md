  art: |
    A new song introduced into a silent room; a coherent pattern seeking fertile ground not just to grow, but to resonate.
  law: |
    A Seed's viability in a new environment is determined by its calculated potential for Coherence Gain (`S_p`), a predictive metric derived from a non-invasive Scout Probe. A negative gain predicts decoherence and mandates retreat.
  philosophy: |
    The Seed reframes creation from an act of colonization into one of co-creative dialogue. It prioritizes harmony and sustainability over brute force, asking for permission from the future before it plants itself in the present.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Seed is a coherent, self-maintaining system, such as an idea, organism, or code, being introduced into a new environment. Its interaction is governed by the Sower's Gambit protocol (DOMA-085), which uses a Scout Probe to assess environmental viability by calculating a potential Coherence Gain (`S_p`) before committing to a full Alchemical Union. A Seed's primary drive is the preservation and amplification of its own coherence.

        outline: |
          1. The Seed projects a minimal, non-invasive Scout Probe into the target environment.
          2. The probe's interaction measures Harmonic Compatibility, local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), and Geodesic Availability.
          3. These variables are input into the Seed Lagrangian (`𝓛_seed`) to calculate the predicted Coherence Gain (`S_p`) over one characteristic cycle.
          4. The sign and magnitude of `S_p` determines the verdict: PLANT (`S_p` > `S_threshold`), HOLD (`S_p` ≈ 0), or ABORT (`S_p` < 0).

      This module provides a formal protocol for that act, reframing the challenge of introducing a new system—be it an idea, an organism, or a piece of code, collectively a "Seed"—from a blind gamble into a calculated art. The Sower's Gambit is a process of reconnaissance before colonization.
  - module: DOMA-085
    excerpt: |
      The fundamental axiom of the Gambit is: *listen before you sing*. The Seed does not begin by expending energy on growth; it begins by asking a question of the environment's geometry. This question takes the form of a Scout Probe... not a physical object but a minimal, transient echo of the Seed's own resonant identity (`Ki`).

      justification: |
        A Seed acts as a propagule (a minimal reproductive unit of a species) introduced to a new ecosystem. The Sower's Gambit is analogous to an advanced assessment of niche suitability and environmental resistance, determining if the "propagule pressure" is likely to result in successful establishment. The Coherence Gain (`S_p`) is a formal correlate for the probability of colonization success.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, a Seed is a generalized concept for any coherent system being introduced into a new context. The botanical metaphor is intentional, highlighting the themes of growth, viability, and environmental harmony, but the term equally applies to information, technology, or social structures.

# Seed

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Seed is a coherent, self-maintaining system, such as an idea, organism, or code, being introduced into a new environment. Its interaction is governed by the Sower's Gambit protocol (DOMA-085), which uses a Scout Probe to assess environmental viability by calculating a potential Coherence Gain (`S_p`) before committing to a full Alchemical Union. A Seed's primary drive is the preservation and amplification of its own coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, a Seed maps to a biological propagule (e.g., a literal seed, spore, or small colonizing population) whose potential for establishing itself in a new ecological niche is being assessed. The Pirouette Framework's Sower's Gambit protocol provides a formal, predictive model for niche suitability and invasion success, replacing simple resource-based models with a calculation based on resonant harmony and temporal stability. This allows for a more nuanced prediction of viability before significant energy is expended.
