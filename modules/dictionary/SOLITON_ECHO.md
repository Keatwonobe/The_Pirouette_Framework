        Metaphor: ‚ÄúBack-reaction echo producing the anomalous moment‚Äù
        Math: Compute spinor self-energy Œ£(p) in background (Œì, ùîâ, defect T); the Pauli term Œ∫ (œÉ^{ŒºŒΩ}F_{ŒºŒΩ}) emerges at one-loop (or non-perturbatively via FEM), with a_‚Ñì = Œ∫_‚Ñì/2. Topology T sets discrete corrections.

    The cosmos rings with the memory of its wounds; this echo nudges the dance of fundamental particles, subtly altering their magnetic spin. A persistent whisper from a topological scar, forever captured in the precession of a lepton.
  law: |
    The anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton `a_‚Ñì` receives a non-perturbative contribution from its interaction with background fields (Œì, ùîâ) and topological defects (T). This contribution is calculable and directly proportional to a Pauli term `Œ∫_‚Ñì` in the lepton's effective action, where `a_‚Ñì = Œ∫_‚Ñì/2`.
  philosophy: |
    The Soliton Echo establishes a direct, falsifiable bridge between large-scale spacetime topology (Wound Channels) and precision particle physics (lepton g-2). It demonstrates that discrete, global structures have tangible, local, and measurable consequences, making topology an active agent in particle dynamics rather than a passive stage.

  The Soliton Echo is the set of corrections to a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment, `a_‚Ñì`, arising from its self-energy calculated in the presence of background Pirouette fields (Temporal Pressure Œì, Coherence Curvature ùîâ) and topological defects (Wound Channels, index T). These corrections manifest as a Pauli term `Œ∫_‚Ñì œÉ^{ŒºŒΩ}F_{ŒºŒΩ}` in the effective Lagrangian, where `a_‚Ñì = Œ∫_‚Ñì/2`. The defect index `T` contributes discretely, while background fields contribute continuously via loop or non-perturbative calculations.

          Measure the anomalous magnetic moment `a_‚Ñì = (g_‚Ñì - 2) / 2` for a lepton ‚Ñì by observing its spin precession frequency relative to its cyclotron frequency in a highly uniform magnetic field. The experimental value `a_‚Ñì(exp)` is compared to the Standard Model prediction `a_‚Ñì(SM)`. The residual, `Œîa_‚Ñì = a_‚Ñì(exp) - a_‚Ñì(SM)`, is the primary signal for new physics, including the Soliton Echo.

        The Soliton Echo is a proposed physical mechanism that generates a contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment `a_‚Ñì` of leptons. The term `Œ∫_‚Ñì/2` calculated in Pirouette is mathematically and operationally identical to a new-physics contribution to `a_‚Ñì`, providing a testable prediction for g-2 experiments.

# Soliton Echo

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Soliton Echo is the set of corrections to a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment, `a_‚Ñì`, arising from its self-energy calculated in the presence of background Pirouette fields (Temporal Pressure Œì, Coherence Curvature ùîâ) and topological defects (Wound Channels, index T). These corrections manifest as a Pauli term `Œ∫_‚Ñì œÉ^{ŒºŒΩ}F_{ŒºŒΩ}` in the effective Lagrangian, where `a_‚Ñì = Œ∫_‚Ñì/2`. The defect index `T` contributes discretely, while background fields contribute continuously via loop or non-perturbative calculations.

## EFT-First Summary
The Soliton Echo is a mechanism within the Pirouette Framework that generates a contribution to the dimension-5 Pauli operator, `(e/4m_‚Ñì) a_‚Ñì œàÃÑ œÉ^{ŒºŒΩ} œà F_{ŒºŒΩ}`, for each lepton `‚Ñì`. This contribution, `a_‚Ñì`, arises from integrating out Pirouette's topological defects (Wound Channels) and background scalar fields (Temporal Pressure). The calculation is analogous to computing one-loop corrections to the lepton-photon vertex in QED, but with insertions from the Pirouette sector providing a new, calculable contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment.
