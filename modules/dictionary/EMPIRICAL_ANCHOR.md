  art: |
    The universe provides its own tuning fork in the electron's quiet, precise echo. The Empirical Anchor is the act of tuning the entire framework to this single, perfect note, ensuring our model sings in harmony with reality's unwavering pitch.
  law: |
    The fundamental scale of Temporal Pressure (Γ) is axiomatically defined as the inverse of the experimentally measured fine-structure constant (α). For an electron's self-interaction, Γ ≡ 1/α ≈ 137.036. This is not a derivation but a definition of scale.
  philosophy: |
    A theory is a ghost until it touches the world. The Anchor transforms the Pirouette Framework from a self-consistent abstraction into a falsifiable, predictive instrument by locking its core dynamics to the most precisely measured constant in nature.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Empirical Anchor is the foundational axiom that calibrates the Pirouette Framework's scale. It defines the dimensionless Temporal Pressure (Γ) for electromagnetic interactions as the inverse of the fine-structure constant (Γ ≡ 1/α). This act is justified by the successful *ab initio* derivation of the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (`a_e = α/2π`) in `CORE-009`, which validates the geometric interpretation of α and provides a non-circular warrant to use its measured value as the framework's absolute reference point.

          1.  Experimentally measure the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (`a_e`) to the highest possible precision (e.g., via Penning trap spectroscopy).

          3.  Define the fundamental scale of Temporal Pressure `Γ` for the system via the axiom `Γ ≡ 1/α`.
          4.  Use this calibrated value of `Γ` to scale the potential term `V_Γ` in the Pirouette Lagrangian for all subsequent electromagnetic predictions.

    excerpt: |
      With `α` revealed as an emergent property of resonant geometry, we can now use its experimentally measured value to calibrate the engine of reality itself. We formalize this relationship not as a loose proportionality, but as a defining axiom that anchors the entire scale of Temporal Pressure. [...] This axiom is not an arbitrary derivation; it is a definition. It is the framework choosing its fundamental unit of measure.

    excerpt: |
      This choice of anchor would be an act of numerology were it not for the result of CORE-009. The successful prediction of the anomaly is what gives us the authority to use it as our anchor, creating a perfect, self-validating, and non-circular loop. [...] The framework is no longer merely consistent with the measurement; it is foundationally calibrated by it.

        The Empirical Anchor axiomatically defines the framework's fundamental interaction scale Γ as the direct inverse of the Standard Model's fine-structure constant, α. This is not an approximation but a definitional choice, reframing α as a geometric consequence of resonant coherence rather than a fundamental coupling constant.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a statistical anchor, which is a fixed point for a regression or fit, the Empirical Anchor is a foundational axiom that sets the absolute scale of the theory's dynamics. It is not a best-fit parameter but a definitional constant, akin to defining the meter based on the speed of light. This term specifically refers to the g-2 grounding, which deprecates the prior "Gravitational Anchor" concept.

# Empirical Anchor

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Empirical Anchor is the foundational axiom that calibrates the Pirouette Framework's scale. It defines the dimensionless Temporal Pressure (Γ) for electromagnetic interactions as the inverse of the fine-structure constant (Γ ≡ 1/α). This act is justified by the successful *ab initio* derivation of the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (`a_e = α/2π`) in `CORE-009`, which validates the geometric interpretation of α and provides a non-circular warrant to use its measured value as the framework's absolute reference point.

## EFT-First Summary
In the Pirouette Framework, the role of a fundamental coupling constant is replaced by a dynamic "cost" term called Temporal Pressure, Γ. The Empirical Anchor is the axiom that fixes the scale of this term for all electromagnetic phenomena. It postulates a direct identity with the Standard Model's fine-structure constant: Γ ≡ 1/α. This is not a derived result but a choice of units, legitimized by the framework's prior, successful first-principles prediction of the electron g-2 anomaly, which links α to pure geometry (`α = 2π * a_e`).
