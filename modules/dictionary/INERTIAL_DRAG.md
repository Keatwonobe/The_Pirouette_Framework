  art: |
    A moving system sails through the ghost of its own past. This wake is not empty; it is a temporal texture that clings, a friction that must be overcome with every moment of non-ideal motion. To persist, the system must pay for its passage in the currency of its own rhythm.
  law: |
    Any deviation of a system from its local geodesic induces a self-interaction with its own temporal wake. This interaction acts as a dissipative force, requiring an expenditure of energy from the system's coherence budget that manifests as a measurable decrease in Temporal Coherence (T₀) and a corresponding increase in its Pirouette Cycle (τₚ), i.e., time dilation.
  philosophy: |
    Inertial Drag reframes inertia not as a passive property of mass, but as an active, ongoing cost of motion. It provides the causal mechanism for relativistic time dilation, grounding it in the principle of coherence preservation. Existence is not free; motion against the grain of time has a price.
pirouette_definition: |
  A form of temporal friction arising from a system's self-interaction with the geometric "wake" it leaves in the coherence manifold. This effect occurs when a system's trajectory deviates from its natural geodesic—its path of maximal Temporal Coherence (T₀). To maintain its resonant pattern against this drag, the system must expend energy from its coherence budget, resulting in a reduction of T₀ and a compensatory slowing of its internal rhythm (time dilation).

          1. Establish a baseline T₀ and τₚ for a test system at rest on its geodesic (e.g., in a stable, low-gravity orbit).
          2. Accelerate the system to a significant fraction of `c`, forcing it off its initial geodesic.
          3. Continuously measure the system's T₀ and τₚ.
          4. The Inertial Drag is inferred from the energy differential required to maintain the new velocity, which correlates directly to the observed decrease in T₀ and increase in τₚ.

    excerpt: |
      Motion is not free. As established in `CORE-011`, any resonant pattern leaves a persistent geometric scar in the coherence manifold—a "wake." A system in motion relative to its geodesic is therefore perpetually interacting with the ghost of its own immediate past. This self-interaction creates a phenomenon we call Inertial Drag. To maintain its form while moving through its own wake, a system must constantly expend energy to re-establish its pattern against this temporal friction.
  - module: DOMA-053
    excerpt: |
      As a system approaches the cosmic speed limit `c`, this Inertial Drag becomes extreme. In an act of profound self-preservation, the system must adapt. The only viable strategy is to slow its internal processes, lengthening its Pirouette Cycle (τₚ) to process the stress of its own passage. This adaptive slowing to preserve resonant integrity *is* the phenomenon of time dilation.

        Inertial Drag is conceptually analogous to the Abraham-Lorentz self-force, where an accelerating charged particle interacts with its own emitted electromagnetic field. In both cases, a system's motion is affected by a "wake" or field it generated, resulting in a dissipative force that resists changes in state. Inertial Drag generalizes this concept from electromagnetism to all forms of existence.

    Inertial Drag is not inertial mass. It is the *process* that gives rise to the *phenomenon* of inertia and time dilation when moving non-geodesically. While related, mass is a measure of a system's coherence density, whereas Inertial Drag is the cost of moving that density through its own temporal wake.

# Inertial Drag

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A form of temporal friction arising from a system's self-interaction with the geometric "wake" it leaves in the coherence manifold. This effect occurs when a system's trajectory deviates from its natural geodesic—its path of maximal Temporal Coherence (T₀). To maintain its resonant pattern against this drag, the system must expend energy from its coherence budget, resulting in a reduction of T₀ and a compensatory slowing of its internal rhythm (time dilation).

## EFT-First Summary
Inertial Drag serves as the Pirouette Framework's causal mechanism for kinetic time dilation and inertia. It can be conceptually mapped to a dissipative self-force, analogous to **radiation reaction** in classical electrodynamics. Just as an accelerating charge interacts with its own retarded field, any system moving off its geodesic interacts with its own past, creating a drag that costs energy and forces an adaptation in its internal clock rate to preserve coherence.
