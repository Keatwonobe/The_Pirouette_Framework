  art: |
    To watch everything is to see nothing. The Weaver's gaze must be both wide and deep, but never both at once. It is the art of hearing the breath drawn before the note is sung.
  law: |
    Analytical resources must be conserved by layering diagnostic rigor. A low-cost, continuous scan of Pressure (P) and Resonance (R) must precede any high-cost, full Lagrangian analysis, with the latter being triggered only by a verified anomaly signature (the Sentinel Trigger).
  philosophy: |
    The cost of attention is a primary constraint on understanding any complex system. Strategic Attention operationalizes the principle that maximal insight is gained not through total observation, but through the precise, targeted application of deep analysis based on efficient, real-time indicators of systemic stress.
pirouette_definition: |
  The guiding principle of applying analytical resources with maximal efficiency, rather than attempting to observe everything at once. It is implemented through the Tiered Audit Protocol, which uses low-cost proxies‚ÄîPressure (P) and Resonance (R)‚Äîfor continuous monitoring. A full, attentionally expensive Lagrangian analysis is reserved for situations where the proxies indicate a significant anomaly, specifically when rising Pressure is not converted into coherent Resonance.

          1. **(Tier 0)** Continuously monitor P and R channels using efficient, real-time proxies.
          2. **(Sentinel Trigger)** If P shows a sustained increase without a corresponding increase in R, initiate a Tier 1 audit.
          3. **(Tier 1)** Perform a subsampled, partial solve of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) to validate the P/R diagnosis.
          4. **(Tier 2)** If the anomaly is confirmed or a post-incident analysis is required, perform a full integration of the Lagrangian (‚à´ùìõ_p dt) for deep, forensic insight.

        In numerical simulations, AMR focuses computational resources (finer grid points) only in regions where the solution has high gradients or complexity. This is analogous to Strategic Attention focusing analytical resources (a full Lagrangian solve) only when simple proxies (P and R) indicate high systemic stress or potential instability.

        The Sentinel Trigger is a form of anomaly detection. A model of normal system behavior (P and R are correlated) is used as a baseline. A deviation from this baseline (P rises, R does not) triggers a more expensive, deeper analysis. This maps directly to industrial process control and network security monitoring.

# Strategic Attention

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Strategic Attention is the guiding principle of applying analytical resources with maximal efficiency, rather than attempting to observe everything at once. It is implemented through the Tiered Audit Protocol, which uses low-cost proxies‚ÄîPressure (P) and Resonance (R)‚Äîfor continuous monitoring. A full, attentionally expensive Lagrangian analysis is reserved for situations where the proxies indicate a significant anomaly, specifically when rising Pressure is not converted into coherent Resonance.

## EFT-First Summary
As a framework principle rather than a physical quantity, Strategic Attention does not have a direct mapping to a single term in effective field theory. Conceptually, it mirrors practices like Adaptive Mesh Refinement in computational physics, where analytical effort is dynamically allocated to regions of high complexity or instability, ensuring that finite computational resources yield the most critical insights.
