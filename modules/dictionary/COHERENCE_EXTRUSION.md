  art: |
    The art of taking the universe's most perfect memory of stability—the proton—and asking it to hold its pose, projecting its coiled history into a tangible, macroscopic shield.
  law: |
    Locking a proton's Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`) along a single geometric axis forbids its Wound Channel from propagating in that dimension, forcing it to unroll into a stable, two-dimensional Resonant Wall to conserve coherence.
  philosophy: |
    Coherence Extrusion embodies the principle of amplifying existing quantum-scale stability rather than inventing new forces. It engineers with the geometry of time itself, treating a proton's history not as a past event but as a raw material for macroscopic construction.
pirouette_definition: |
  An engineering process that applies a tuned resonant field to lock a proton's temporal update cycle (`τ_p`) along a single spatial axis. This intervention prevents the proton's helical Wound Channel from coiling forward in time along that axis, forcing its temporal history to unroll, or 'extrude,' into the remaining two spatial dimensions. The result is a persistent, macroscopic 2D surface of near-perfect coherence known as a Resonant Wall.

      - name: Resonant Wall Induction & Diagnostics
        outline: |
          A hydrogen plasma is seeded into a gyroid scaffold and subjected to a 9 GHz Helical Cavity Resonator to induce a coherence-lock on the z-axis. A transverse `Γ` gradient is then ramped using a dual-tone RF spin lock, driving the extrusion. The resulting surface's properties (Reflectance, Coherence Gradient, Stability) are diagnosed via laser interferometry and phase-drift monitoring.

        pitfalls: [`Incomplete mode pinning during cryogenic quench`, `Phase-conjugation failure at the manifold suture leading to boundary instability.`]

    excerpt: |
      The mechanism for this amplification is a process we term **Coherence Extrusion**. It is a chain of causality grounded in the core principles of the framework... The key intervention is to apply a precisely tuned field that **locks the proton's Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`) along a single geometric axis**. We do not stop the proton from resonating; we simply forbid its resonant state from *updating* or propagating along that one direction.
  - module: DOMA-204
    excerpt: |
      With its forward temporal propagation blocked in one dimension, the proton's Wound Channel can no longer coil into a helix. To maintain its coherence, it is forced to "unroll" or extrude its temporal existence into the remaining two spatial dimensions. The result is a stable, macroscopic 2D surface—a **Resonant Wall**. This wall is the proton's history, once a microscopic spiral, now projected into a tangible shield.

      justification: |
        The process creates a stable 2D boundary (the Resonant Wall) separating distinct regions of spacetime (normal vs. temporally locked). This is analogous to a domain wall forming during a symmetry-breaking phase transition, where the "order parameter" is the state of the temporal update cycle. The Resonant Wall is a defect in the temporal coherence field.

  disambiguation: |
    The term "Extrusion" is a direct analogy to metallurgy. Here, the one-dimensional Wound Channel (the "billet") is forced through a zero-dimensional temporal aperture (the locked `τ_p` cycle, the "die") to produce a two-dimensional spatial surface (the "extruded profile"). It is a projection, not a creation of new matter.
