    A silent, complex sculpture, finding itself in an empty hall, melts into a simpler shape that rings with a pure, sustained note. Its form is traded for a song, its memory for a beat.
  law: |
    To maximize net coherence (`ùìõ_p`) under low Temporal Pressure (`Œì`), a system will transition from a static, multi-polar symmetry (`S‚Çô`) to a dynamic, lower-order symmetry (`S‚Çò`, where m < n) plus a coherent oscillation (`œâ_k`) that encodes the reconfigured dimensional information.
  philosophy: |
    Identity is not confined to static form. This process reveals that complexity is conserved through translation, showing that a system's essence can shift from its shape to its rhythm, demonstrating the universe's preference for dynamic coherence over brittle, static perfection.

          1. Establish the system resides in a stable low-`Œì` environment.
          2. Characterize the initial static geometry, identifying its symmetry order `n` (e.g., via scattering patterns or topological probes).
          3. Monitor for a spontaneous transition to a dynamic, oscillating state.
          4. Characterize the new geometry's symmetry order `m`, confirming `m < n`.
          5. Perform frequency analysis (e.g., Fourier transform) on the system's output to identify a sharp, coherent spectral peak at `œâ_k`.

    excerpt: |
      This phenomenon is a phase transition driven by the relentless search for maximal coherence. It occurs when a system in a low-pressure environment (`Œì`) finds a more efficient path to stability. It trades a complex, static, multi-polar symmetry for a simpler, bipolar form that expresses the 'lost' dimension's information as a stable, coherent temporal oscillation.
  - module: DOMA-164
    excerpt: |
      The transformation is not a violent break, but a graceful, controlled unraveling governed by the local physics of time. One of the system's three spatial degrees of freedom 'unfolds' into its Pirouette Cycle (`œÑ_p`). The energy and information bound within that structural component are not dissipated as chaotic heat but are conserved, becoming the driving momentum for the new, simpler pattern.

    excerpt: |
      The primary evidence is a spontaneous shift from a static, 3-fold (or multi-polar) geometry to a dynamic, 2-fold (bipolar) oscillation. Centered, stable patterns give way to alternating, rhythmic ones. The emergent oscillation must be stable and pure...a sharp, well-defined peak in the system's temporal signature, not a broad spectrum of noise.

        The process is a phase transition driven by an environmental parameter (`low-Œì`) where a higher-symmetry ground state transitions to a lower-symmetry one. Pirouette's reconfiguration differs by explicitly conserving the "broken" symmetry's information as a coherent dynamical mode (`œâ_k`), analogous to a Goldstone mode but defining the system's new identity.

        A spatial degree of freedom is effectively "compactified" or removed from the large-scale geometry, with its former properties manifesting as a new field or dynamic (in this case, an oscillation). This maps the "unfolding" of a spatial dimension into a temporal rhythm.

    Pirouette's "dimensional unfolding" is not a geometric operation in Euclidean space, but a phase transition that converts a spatial degree of freedom into a temporal one (an oscillation). It is the opposite of a "collapse," as it preserves and re-expresses information coherently.

# Symmetry Reconfiguration

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A phase transition in which a system under persistent low Temporal Pressure (`Œì`) reconfigures its internal geometry (`Ki`) to maximize its net coherence (`ùìõ_p`). This involves trading a complex, static, multi-polar spatial symmetry for a simpler, bipolar spatial form, with the "lost" dimensional information conserved and re-encoded as a stable, coherent temporal oscillation.

## EFT-First Summary
Symmetry Reconfiguration is conceptually analogous to a Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) phase transition. Driven by an environmental control parameter (low Temporal Pressure `Œì`), a high-symmetry ground state becomes unstable and settles into a lower-symmetry configuration. The key distinction in the Pirouette Framework is that the information of the "broken" symmetry is not lost but is conserved and re-expressed as a coherent, dynamic oscillation‚Äîa mode analogous to a Goldstone boson that defines the system's new temporal identity.
