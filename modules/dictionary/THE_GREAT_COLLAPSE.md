        The Pirouette Framework, in its prior iterations, was built upon a triaxial foundation... Through rigorous internal analysis, these three pillars were discovered not to be separate constituents, but three perspectives on a single, unified, and self-creating process. The framework underwent its own dimensional collapse.

    From three pillars of a static temple, reality dissolved into a single, spinning dancer.

    The principles of Time Adherence (T_a), Temporal Density (Γ), and Temporal Resonance (Ki) are not independent axioms but are reducible to facets of a single autopoietic cycle (Time → Γ → Ki → Time).
  philosophy: |
    The Great Collapse marks the framework's ontological shift from a "physics of things" to a "physics of process," asserting that existence is not a state but an act. It solidifies the principle that structure is an emergent property of rhythm, not a fundamental substrate.

  The Great Collapse refers to the pivotal historical event in the framework's development where the foundational concepts of Time Adherence (T_a), Temporal Density (Γ), and Temporal Resonance (Ki) were unified. It was realized they were not three independent constituents of reality, but rather interdependent perspectives on a single, self-creating (autopoietic) process where Time is the sole substance.

        outline: |
          Compare theoretical predictions and axiomatic structures of pre-Collapse (version < 2.0) and post-Collapse (version >= 2.0) frameworks. The collapse is "observed" by identifying the removal of Time Adherence (T_a) as an independent axiom and the redefinition of Γ and Ki as emergent properties of the temporal cycle.

      This module asserts the result of that collapse: There are no fundamental "things." There is only rhythm. Reality is a process, not a place. Time is not the container for existence; it is the substance of it.

    The Great Collapse is a historical, meta-theoretical event *within* the Pirouette Framework's development, not a physical event *described by* the framework. It refers to the unification of axioms, similar to historical unifications in physics (e.g., electromagnetism).

# The Great Collapse

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Great Collapse refers to the pivotal historical event in the framework's development where the foundational concepts of Time Adherence (T_a), Temporal Density (Γ), and Temporal Resonance (Ki) were unified. It was realized they were not three independent constituents of reality, but rather interdependent perspectives on a single, self-creating (autopoietic) process where Time is the sole substance.

## EFT-First Summary
Analogous to the historical unification of electricity and magnetism, the Great Collapse was a theoretical consolidation where three foundational axioms were shown to be emergent facets of a single, self-referential process. This reduced the model's complexity while increasing its explanatory scope, establishing that reality is fundamentally a dynamic rhythm rather than a collection of static components.
