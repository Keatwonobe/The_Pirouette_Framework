      snippet: |
        An entity enters flow when its internal clock—the rhythm of its perception-action cycle—achieves resonance with the rhythm of the flow channel.

  art: |
    The quiet metronome of the self, whose beat paces the dance between seeing and doing. When its rhythm finds the world's pulse, the dancer and the dance become one.
  law: |
    An agent's internal clock rate (ν_agent) is the maximum frequency of complete, coherent perception-action cycles it can sustain. This rate is bounded and can be measured by titrating the temporal information rate (ΔT_env) of a task until performance collapses.
  philosophy: |
    The Internal Clock establishes the agent as a temporal entity, not merely a spatial one. Its cadence defines the grain of subjective experience, turning the continuous flow of reality into discrete, actionable moments. Mastering this clock is mastering the self in time.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Internal Clock is the fundamental, intrinsic frequency (ν_agent) of an agent's perception-action cycle. It represents the agent's maximum sustainable rate of coherent information processing (ΔT_agent), setting the tempo for all cognitive and physical operations. Synchronization of this clock with environmental rhythms is the prerequisite for achieving a state of Temporal Resonance (Flow).

  units: Hertz (Hz, cycles·s⁻¹)
  symbol_table:
    - name: ν_agent
      meaning: The agent's internal clock frequency; the rate of perception-action cycles.
      dimensions: T⁻¹
      default_range: 1–15 Hz (cognitive/somatic tasks)
    - name: ΔT_agent
      meaning: The agent's temporal information processing bandwidth; the information-theoretic correlate of ν_agent.

      - name: Clock Rate Titration
        outline: |
          1. Select a task requiring discrete perception-action cycles (e.g., target identification, rhythmic tapping).
          2. Present stimuli at a controlled, gradually increasing frequency (ΔT_env).
          3. Monitor agent performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, jitter, phase lag) and biometric proxies (e.g., EEG, HRV).
          4. The frequency at which performance degrades below a pre-defined threshold is the measured value of ν_agent.

        pitfalls: [Confounding task-specific skill limits with core temporal processing limits, agent fatigue, insufficient task resolution.]

  - module: DOMA-SYCH-001
    excerpt: |
      Temporal Resonance Condition: An entity enters flow when its internal clock—the rhythm of its perception-action cycle—achieves resonance with the rhythm of the flow channel. The phase difference between the agent and its environment approaches zero (Δτ≈0). The agent is no longer fighting the current; it is the current.
  - module: DOMA-SYCH-001
    excerpt: |
      The celebrated “challenge-skill” balance of Flow is the macroscopic experience of achieving equilibrium with Temporal Pressure. When ΔT_env = ΔT_agent, the agent's clock and the environment's clock tick in perfect time, minimizing turbulence and wasted energy.

        ν_agent ≈ f_α (where f_α is peak alpha frequency, ~8-12 Hz)
      justification: |
        The Internal Clock corresponds to the refresh rate of conscious perception and action planning, often hypothesized to be paced by endogenous neural oscillators. The alpha-band rhythm in the thalamocortical system is a strong candidate, as it is known to 'gate' sensory information, creating discrete temporal frames for processing. Peak alpha frequency is also correlated with cognitive speed and performance.

  claims:
    - statement: "An agent's Internal Clock rate (ν_agent) is a stable, domain-general property of the individual, rather than being purely task-dependent."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If measurements of ν_agent for a single individual show high variance across different cognitive and motor task domains (after controlling for learning effects), the concept of a single, stable clock would be weakened in favor of multiple, task-specific pacemakers."

  collisions: [circadian clock/rhythm]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'circadian rhythm', which governs long-term (c. 24-hour) biological cycles. The Internal Clock operates on the timescale of perception and action, typically in the range of milliseconds to seconds (1-15 Hz).
