        1. Direct Intervention (Dissolving the Dam): This involves supplying the missing coherence key directly to the system (e.g., supplementing with sodium butyrate). It is a targeted act of injecting a clean, coherent signal into a system that has forgotten how to produce it‚Äîa tuning fork held against a silent instrument, reminding it of its proper pitch.

  art: |
    To heal a thirst, one does not attack the desert but brings water. Direct Intervention is this act: supplying the missing note to a silent instrument, reminding it of its forgotten song.
  law: |
    A system suffering from Coherence Atrophy (demonstrably low K_œÑ) will exhibit a measurable, positive shift in its Lagrangian state (Œîùìõ_p > 0) upon the introduction of a specific, missing coherent signal (Œ∫‚Å∫), provided the signal is the primary limiting factor for system function.
  philosophy: |
    This tactic re-frames therapy from an act of aggression against a pathogen to an act of cultivation. It posits that the most efficient intervention is not always to add complexity (a new weapon) but to restore a foundational simplicity (a missing note), re-enabling the system's innate capacity for self-regulation.
pirouette_definition: |
  A therapeutic tactic within a Restorative Protocol that addresses a Pathology of Signal Absence by directly supplying a missing, high-coherence signal to a system. This intervention acts as a catalyst to restore Laminar Flow and immediately increase the system's internal coherence (K_œÑ), thereby lifting it from a state of Coherence Atrophy. It is a targeted application of a Daedalus Gambit focused on restoring a known deficit.
operational_definition:
  units: Context-dependent (e.g., moles, bits/sec) for the signal; dimensionless gain factor for the system response.
  symbol_table:
    - name: Œ∫‚Å∫
      meaning: Exogenously supplied coherent signal or coherence key.
      dimensions: Contextual (e.g., M for mass of a chemical substance).

    procedures:
      - name: Butyrate Deficit Restoration Test
        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline for a system diagnosed with Coherence Atrophy linked to butyrate deficiency. Measure key markers: gut permeability (zonulin), systemic inflammation (IL-6, TNF-Œ±), and cognitive function scores.
          2. Administer a specified therapeutic dose of sodium butyrate (Œ∫‚Å∫) daily for 90 days.
          3. Re-measure markers at T+30, T+60, and T+90 days, plotting their trajectory against the baseline.
        expected_signals: [Statistically significant decrease in zonulin and inflammatory cytokines, statistically significant increase in cognitive function scores.]
        pitfalls: [Malabsorption of the supplemented signal, incorrect diagnosis (butyrate absence is a symptom, not the root cause), presence of a more dominant pathology masking the effect.]

    excerpt: |
      To heal a pathology of absence, we do not require a poison. We require a note, a signal, a current. The therapeutic strategy is a Daedalus Gambit (DYNA-003): a precise, minimal intervention designed not to attack the system, but to restore its own capacity for self-regulation and laminar flow. Direct Intervention (Dissolving the Dam): This involves supplying the missing coherence key directly to the system (e.g., supplementing with sodium butyrate).
  - module: DOMA-098
    excerpt: |
      A pathology of absence is a state where the system's ability to generate internal coherence (`K_œÑ`) has collapsed due to a missing signal like butyrate... The Restorative Protocol is a direct intervention to raise the Lagrangian. Direct Intervention immediately boosts `K_œÑ`, while Indirect Intervention durably rebuilds the system's capacity for `K_œÑ` and lowers `V_Œì` by repairing its integrity.

      domain: CM
      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        Direct Intervention acts as an exogenous, feed-forward input to counteract a known, persistent internal deficit ('signal absence'), bypassing the compromised feedback loops that should be generating the signal endogenously. It pre-emptively supplies the necessary component rather than waiting for an error signal to trigger a response.

      justification: |
        In a biological system where a process is stalled due to lack of a key substrate (e.g., butyrate), Direct Intervention is the addition of that substrate. This application of Le Ch√¢telier's principle shifts the system's chemical equilibrium to favor the desired downstream products and functions.

  claims:
    - statement: "In a system with a diagnosed single-point Coherence Atrophy, Direct Intervention with the specific missing signal will produce a greater and more rapid increase in system function (ŒîK_œÑ/Œît) than a systemic, non-specific intervention."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "An experiment where a non-specific, 'Indirect Intervention' (e.g., a diverse prebiotic fiber mix) produces a faster and larger restoration of function than direct butyrate supplementation in subjects with confirmed low butyrate production."

naming_notes:
  collisions: []
  disambiguation: |
    Direct Intervention must be distinguished from **Indirect Intervention**. Direct Intervention supplies the missing signal itself (the *product*, e.g., butyrate). Indirect Intervention restores the system's *capacity* to produce the signal (the *process*, e.g., prebiotics that feed butyrate-producing bacteria). Direct Intervention is a patch; Indirect Intervention is a systemic repair.
