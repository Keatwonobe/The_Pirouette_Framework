        The coherence vector **K**_œÑ spans a space defined by a system's relationship to the past, present, and future.

  art: |
    We sought to define a being and found instead a chord, struck in the resonant chamber of the present moment. Its notes are three: the echo of what it has been, the touch of what it is now, and the whisper of what it might become.
  law: |
    A system's long-term stability requires non-zero values for all three components of its Coherence Vector. The nullification of any one component (*K*<sub>p</sub> ‚Üí 0, *K*<sub>i</sub> ‚Üí 0, or *K*<sub>r</sub> ‚Üí 0) leads to a predictable, catastrophic failure mode (Stagnation, Isolation, or Amnesia, respectively).
  philosophy: |
    Coherence is not a scalar quantity to be maximized, but a dynamic posture to be held. The Coherence Vector reframes existence as the act of orienting oneself in time, constantly adjusting the balance between memory, action, and potential to maintain a resilient harmony against environmental pressures.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence Vector, **K**_œÑ, is the three-dimensional vector that quantifies a system's Temporal Coherence. Its orthogonal components are Prospective Coherence (*K*<sub>p</sub>), Immediate Coherence (*K*<sub>i</sub>), and Retrospective Coherence (*K*<sub>r</sub>), which measure the system's resonant coupling with its potential futures, its present environment, and its historical identity, respectively. The vector's orientation and magnitude define a system's temporal posture and its capacity for stable, autopoietic existence.

    procedures:
      - name: Prospective Probe
        outline: |
          Measure a system's possibility space by analyzing its response to stochastic perturbations or running ensembles of predictive simulations. Quantify the richness and viability of its accessible future geodesics.
        expected_signals: [Variance in simulated outcomes, branching ratio of decision trees, quantum uncertainty metrics.]
        pitfalls: [Observer effect collapsing potential, model overfitting, mistaking chaotic noise for rich potential.]
      - name: Immediate Probe
        outline: |
          Analyze the mutual information and resonant coupling between a system and its environment in real-time. This involves measuring the efficiency and clarity of information exchange.
        expected_signals: [Signal-to-noise ratio in communication channels, network centrality metrics, measures of symbiotic energy transfer.]
        pitfalls: [Confounding environmental noise with system signal, ignoring time-lagged feedback loops.]
      - name: Retrospective Probe
        outline: |
          Analyze the integrity and persistence of a system's historical trace (its Wound Channel). This involves reconstructing past states and measuring the autocorrelation of its core identity patterns over time.
        expected_signals: [High-fidelity signal from archival data, low pattern decay rate, structural integrity of historical records.]
        pitfalls: [Data corruption (Amnesia), survivorship bias, misinterpreting adaptation as identity loss.]

    excerpt: |
      The coherence vector **K**_œÑ spans a space defined by a system's relationship to the past, present, and future.
      1. Prospective Coherence (*K*<sub>p</sub>): *Resonance with the Future* This is a system's coherence with its own field of potential.
      2. Immediate Coherence (*K*<sub>i</sub>): *Resonance with the Present* This is a system's ability to act, react, and harmonize with its current environment.
      3. Retrospective Coherence (*K*<sub>r</sub>): *Resonance with the Past* This is a system's coherence with its own history.
  - module: DOMA-018
    excerpt: |
      The universal drive to maximize coherence is not just about increasing its total magnitude, but about constantly *orienting* the coherence vector. Forces and actions are the result of a system adjusting its temporal posture‚Äîshifting its balance between past, present, and future‚Äîto find the most harmonious chord available within the pressure of its environment.

      justification: |
        The kinetic term for the Coherence Vector in the Pirouette Lagrangian is mathematically identical to that for a multiplet of non-interacting scalar fields. This suggests **K**_œÑ can be treated as an isovector field in an abstract internal space, where its "orientation" represents the system's temporal posture.

      falsifier: "Demonstrate a system where a direct, unmediated change in one component (e.g., erasing a memory, *K*<sub>r</sub>) causes an instantaneous, non-Lagrangian-coupled change in another (e.g., its future potential, *K*<sub>p</sub>), without any intervening action or environmental pressure."

    - statement: "A system with a near-zero value for any single coherence component (e.g., *K*<sub>i</sub> ‚âà 0) will exhibit lower long-term stability under environmental perturbation than a system with a balanced, non-zero vector of the same magnitude |**K**_œÑ|."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Identify a class of systems that are maximally stable when specialized entirely along one axis (e.g., pure memory systems with *K*<sub>p</sub>=0, *K*<sub>i</sub>=0) and which consistently outperform balanced systems in novel, unpredictable environments."

  disambiguation: |
    The Coherence Vector **K**_œÑ is a field vector in an abstract space and should not be confused with kinetic energy. The œÑ subscript explicitly ties it to Temporal Coherence, and its components (*K*<sub>p</sub>, *K*<sub>i</sub>, *K*<sub>r</sub>) are scalar fields, not constants.
