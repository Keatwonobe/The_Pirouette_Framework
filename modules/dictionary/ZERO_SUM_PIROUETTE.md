        Models annihilation as a catastrophic resolution of the Pirouette Lagrangian where two phase-conjugate systems undergo a paradoxical Alchemical Union. Their Wound Channels are mutually erased, converting their structured coherence (Kτ) into a burst of unbound energy (Γ).

  art: |
    A catastrophic union where two opposing songs find their ultimate harmony not by creating a new chord, but by canceling each other into a final, radiant silence.
  law: |
    A resonant interaction between two phase-conjugate systems (Δφ ≈ π) where their combined structural coherence (Kτ) collapses to zero, resulting in the total conversion of their sustained potential (V_Γ) into unbound energy (Γ).
  philosophy: |
    For a thing to be perfectly unmade proves that it was, in fact, made. Annihilation is the universe's ultimate reminder that every form is a temporary loan from an ocean of pure potential, and that all structure must eventually be prepared to repay its debt.
pirouette_definition: |
  A unique and catastrophic solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) in which two systems with precisely phase-conjugate coherence knots (`Ki`) and mirror-image Wound Channels (CORE-011) undergo a resonant merger. Their opposite coherence terms (`Kτ`) undergo perfect destructive interference, collapsing the total system coherence to zero. This nullification of structure releases the total potential energy (`V_Γ`) required to sustain their forms, converting their mass-energy into a burst of unbound, high-entropy energy (Γ) with near-perfect efficiency.

          Introduce a particle and its corresponding antiparticle into a quiescent volume (low Γ). Guide them to interaction and use a 4π detector array to measure the total energy, momentum, and type of all outgoing products. The procedure aims to verify the complete conversion of initial rest mass into final-state energy with no residual structured mass.

    excerpt: |
      A particle is not a thing, but a stable, self-perpetuating rhythm—a topological knot of coherence (`Ki`). Its passage through spacetime carves a persistent geometric scar, a **Wound Channel**, into the local coherence manifold. An antiparticle is its perfect topological mirror... The event is the physical act of these two geometries meeting and mutually erasing one another, returning the manifold to a smooth, unscarred state.
  - module: DOMA-109
    excerpt: |
      The immense energy release associated with annihilation is a direct conversion of structured information into entropy. The total coherence of the two systems (`Kτ₁ + Kτ₂`) represents a quantity of low-entropy structural information. During the manifold collapse, this information is not lost; it is unbound, transformed with near-perfect efficiency into the chaotic, high-entropy energy of the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).

        The Zero-Sum Pirouette provides a geometric and information-theoretic model for the observed phenomenon of particle-antiparticle annihilation. The complete conversion of mass to energy is framed as the conversion of structured, time-persistent coherence (Kτ) into unbound, high-entropy energy (Γ). The model's conditions for the pirouette—resonant purity and phase conjugation—map directly to the requirements of particle-antiparticle pairing.

    Distinct from simple destructive wave interference. The Pirouette is a topological event that erases the underlying Wound Channels—the persistent structures themselves—not merely a transient cancellation of their propagating fields. It is an act of un-making, not just silencing.

# Zero-Sum Pirouette

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A unique and catastrophic solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) in which two systems with precisely phase-conjugate coherence knots (`Ki`) and mirror-image Wound Channels (CORE-011) undergo a resonant merger. Their opposite coherence terms (`Kτ`) undergo perfect destructive interference, collapsing the total system coherence to zero. This nullification of structure releases the total potential energy (`V_Γ`) required to sustain their forms, converting their mass-energy into a burst of unbound, high-entropy energy (Γ) with near-perfect efficiency.

## EFT-First Summary
The Zero-Sum Pirouette is the Pirouette Framework's operational and conceptual model for particle-antiparticle annihilation, as described in the Standard Model of particle physics. The process, such as an electron and a positron annihilating into two photons (e⁻ + e⁺ → 2γ), is interpreted as the mutual erasure of two phase-conjugate geometric structures. The total mass-energy of the initial particles, `E=mc²`, is understood as the energetic value of their stored coherence, which is released with near-perfect efficiency upon their resonant dissolution. (See: Peskin & Schroeder, *An Introduction to QFT*).
