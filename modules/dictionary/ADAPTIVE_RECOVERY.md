      snippet: |
        Often, the landscape is permanently altered, and the old path is no longer the most efficient. Here, the system uses its old Wound Channel as a guide, not a destination. It latches onto the familiar echo but modifies its Ki pattern to find a more stable resonance in the new environment. It carves a new channel adjacent to the old one. This is the resilience of a river finding a more efficient course around a new obstacle.

  art: |
    The river carves a new path around the stone, remembering the sea but respecting the mountain. It does not force its old way but finds a new, more elegant flow.
  law: |
    A system post-collapse exhibits Adaptive Recovery if its new stable resonant pattern (Ki→a) is a local modification of its pre-collapse pattern (Ki), occupying an adjacent basin of attraction on the coherence manifold, and resulting in a higher coherence integral (S_p) than a Restorative return would achieve in the new environment.
  philosophy: |
    Adaptive Recovery demonstrates that resilience is not mere restoration but intelligent navigation. It is the system's capacity to honor its history (the Wound Channel) without being enslaved by it, finding a new way to thrive in a world that has irrevocably changed.
pirouette_definition: |
  An outcome of systemic recovery where a system, post-collapse, establishes a new stable resonant pattern (Ki→a) that is a modification of its original pattern (Ki). Guided by the geometric memory of its Wound Channel, the system finds a new, more coherent equilibrium in a permanently altered environment, rather than returning to its pre-collapse state. This path is chosen because it maximizes the system's coherence integral under the new environmental constraints.

        outline: |
          1. Characterize the system's pre-collapse resonant pattern (Ki) via time-series analysis of its primary observables (e.g., Fourier modes, phase space attractor geometry).
          2. Induce or observe a systemic collapse event sufficient to shatter Ki.
          3. Monitor the system through the Latency, Acceleration, and Stabilization phases.
          4. Characterize the new, stable post-recovery pattern (Ki→a) using the same methods as step 1.
          5. Compare the topology of Ki→a to Ki. Adaptive Recovery is confirmed if Ki→a is topologically similar but measurably distinct from Ki (e.g., shifted centroid in phase space, different dominant frequency), and this new state shows higher stability (lower dissipation, higher coherence) in the post-collapse environment.
        expected_signals: [A stable, periodic or quasi-periodic signal post-recovery, with mode structure related but not identical to the pre-collapse signal.]
        pitfalls: [Misidentifying a long Stabilization phase for a new stable pattern; insufficient environmental change to distinguish Adaptive from Restorative recovery.]

    excerpt: |
      The choice between Restorative, Adaptive, and Transformative paths is not a choice at all; it is the inevitable outcome of the system following its new geodesic toward a new peak on the coherence manifold. Resilience, therefore, is not a measure of a system's ability to resist change, but a measure of its efficiency in finding its new path of maximal coherence after a disruption.

  candidates:
    - target: System settling into a new, adjacent local minimum of a potential energy landscape.
      domain: Math|CM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      equation_hint: |
        δV(x_0) = 0; δV(x_a) = 0 where |x_a - x_0| is small and V_new(x_a) < V_new(x_0)
      justification: |
        A system's pre-collapse state (Ki) corresponds to a local minimum in a potential landscape. A collapse is a perturbation that kicks the system out of this minimum and may also deform the landscape itself. Adaptive Recovery is the system settling into a different, nearby local minimum that has become more stable under the new conditions, rather than returning to the original one.

      confidence: 0.8
  adopted:
    - target: System settling into a new, adjacent local minimum of a potential energy landscape.
      rationale: This mapping is general, widely understood in dynamical systems theory, and accurately captures the core dynamic of finding a new, nearby, and more stable equilibrium post-perturbation.
      confidence: 0.8
constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A system will choose Adaptive Recovery over Restorative Recovery if and only if the coherence integral (S_p) for the adapted path is greater than the integral for the restorative path in the post-collapse environment."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observe a system in a changed environment consistently returning to a demonstrably less-stable original state (Restorative) when a more-stable, modified state (Adaptive) is accessible from its Wound Channel."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'adaptation' as a slow, evolutionary process. Adaptive Recovery is a rapid, post-collapse dynamic where a new stable state is found during the 'Acceleration' phase of a single recovery event, not over generations of selection.
