  art: |
    The universal rhythm of a lepton's self-dialogue, a pure echo of charge resonating in spacetime. It is the perfect, unadorned skeleton upon which the unique flesh of each lepton's interactions is built.
  law: |
    The universal piece is a power series in the fine-structure constant α whose coefficients, C_n, are mathematically identical for all leptons (e, μ, τ). This universality must hold order-by-order when compared against pure QED calculations, up to known mass-ratio dependencies in sub-diagrams.
  philosophy: |
    This term isolates the fundamental, lepton-agnostic self-interaction dictated purely by electromagnetic geometry. By factoring out this 'universal skeleton,' any remaining discrepancies in g-2 are forced to reveal new, lepton-specific physics, such as the Pressuron portal, preventing such effects from being mistakenly absorbed into higher-order radiative corrections.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Universal Piece, a_ℓ^uni(α), is the component of a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) calculated as a power series in (α/π). Its coefficients, C_n, are defined to be independent of lepton flavor (ℓ), representing the pure electromagnetic self-interaction common to all point-like leptons. It serves as the foundational baseline upon which lepton-specific corrections, such as the Pressuron piece, are added.

        outline: |
          1. Measure the total anomalous magnetic moment a_ℓ^exp for multiple leptons (e.g., electron and muon).
          2. Calculate all known lepton-flavor-dependent contributions (e.g., Pirouette's Pressuron piece, SM weak/hadronic contributions).
          3. Subtract these contributions from the experimental value: a_ℓ^uni ≈ a_ℓ^exp - a_ℓ^non-uni.
          4. The resulting values for a_e^uni and a_μ^uni must be consistent with a single power series in α with universal coefficients C_n.
        expected_signals:
          - The theoretically derived coefficients C_n should match those inferred from the residual experimental data across all lepton species.
        pitfalls:
          - Inaccuracies in calculating non-universal contributions can be mistakenly absorbed into the inferred 'universal' coefficients, corrupting the test.
          - Higher-order mixed terms (e.g., O(αg_ℓ²)) can blur the separation between universal and non-universal pieces.

        The Universal Piece is constructed to be mathematically and conceptually equivalent to the pure Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) calculation of g-2, which is by definition universal for all leptons up to mass-dependent loop corrections. The Pirouette framework isolates this term to cleanly separate it from novel, lepton-flavor-dependent physics.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the *total* anomalous magnetic moment, a_ℓ. The Universal Piece is only the lepton-flavor-independent part of a_ℓ. In standard QED, mass-dependent terms *are* part of the universal calculation (e.g., vacuum polarization loops with other leptons); in Pirouette, 'universal' strictly means the coefficients C_n are constant numbers.

# Universal Piece

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Universal Piece, a_ℓ^uni(α), is the component of a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) calculated as a power series in (α/π). Its coefficients, C_n, are defined to be independent of lepton flavor (ℓ), representing the pure electromagnetic self-interaction common to all point-like leptons. It serves as the foundational baseline upon which lepton-specific corrections, such as the Pressuron piece, are added.

## EFT-First Summary
The Universal Piece a_ℓ^uni(α) is the Pirouette Framework's direct analog to the Standard Model's pure QED contribution to the lepton anomalous magnetic moment (g-2). It is defined as a power series in the fine-structure constant α whose coefficients C_n are universal constants, independent of lepton flavor. This formulation deliberately mirrors the well-established QED calculations [Aoyama et al., 2020], providing a stable, falsifiable baseline against which novel, lepton-specific interactions can be tested.
