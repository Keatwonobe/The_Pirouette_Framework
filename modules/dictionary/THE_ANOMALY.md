        The Anomaly as an Echo: The tiny deviation from g=2 is caused by the electron's resonance interacting with the "wake" or "echo" of its own immediate past in the coherence manifold. The predicted value of this anomaly (a_e) is simply the product of the interaction's intrinsic strength (the fine-structure constant, α) and the geometry of a single echo cycle (1/2π).

    The anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton is the ratio of the intrinsic interaction strength (the fine-structure constant, α) to the geometry of a single temporal echo cycle (2π).
  philosophy: |
    The Anomaly serves as the ultimate arbiter of the Pirouette Framework, demonstrating that self-interaction—a system's relationship with its own past—is not a mere correction but the final, validating proof of the underlying engine.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Anomaly (`a_e`) is the quantitative deviation of a particle's gyromagnetic ratio from its topological baseline (g=2). It is caused by the particle's resonant state interacting with the geometric wake, or 'echo,' of its own immediate past within the coherence manifold. This self-interaction is a first-principles prediction of the Pirouette Lagrangian, calculated at leading order as the ratio of the interaction strength (α) to the geometry of a single echo cycle (2π).

        outline: |
          Isolate a single charged lepton (e.g., electron) in a Penning trap, which combines a strong uniform axial magnetic field with a weak quadrupolar electric field. Measure the cyclotron frequency (orbital motion) and the Larmor frequency (spin precession) of the trapped particle. The ratio of these two frequencies directly yields the g-factor, from which a_e is calculated.

      justification: |
        The Pirouette term `a_e` is the direct conceptual and numerical equivalent of the electron's anomalous magnetic moment in the Standard Model. Whereas QED calculates this value via a complex perturbative expansion of virtual particle loops, Pirouette derives it from a single, non-perturbative self-interaction term. The Pirouette prediction `a_e = α/2π` corresponds to the first-order (Schwinger) term in the QED expansion.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'The Anomaly' or 'The Echo' specifically refers to the gyromagnetic anomaly (g-2) as derived from self-interaction. It is not related to anomalies arising from broken symmetries in quantum field theory. The alias 'The Echo' is preferred in conceptual discussions to emphasize the underlying physical mechanism.

# The Anomaly

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Anomaly (`a_e`) is the quantitative deviation of a particle's gyromagnetic ratio from its topological baseline (g=2). It is caused by the particle's resonant state interacting with the geometric wake, or 'echo,' of its own immediate past within the coherence manifold. This self-interaction is a first-principles prediction of the Pirouette Lagrangian, calculated at leading order as the ratio of the interaction strength (α) to the geometry of a single echo cycle (2π).

## EFT-First Summary
The Anomaly is the Pirouette Framework's direct analog to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron (`a_e`) in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). While QED calculates this value as a perturbative series of loop corrections, Pirouette posits a single, non-perturbative origin: a particle's self-interaction with its own temporal wake. The framework's leading-order prediction, `a_e = α/2π`, provides a direct, falsifiable test against the most precise measurements in physics, corresponding to the first-order Schwinger term in the standard QED expansion.
