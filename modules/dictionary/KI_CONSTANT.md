    Ki is the tempo of the universe remembering itself, the angular measure of coherence realignment. The tether of its dual nature binds rest to motion, and the snap of their transition is the fundamental tick of all transformation.
  law: |
    Ki manifests in two discrete, frame-dependent values: \(K_{i,\text{rest}} = \pi+1\) in a laboratory frame and \(K_{i,\text{motion}} = 4\pi/3\) in a co-moving, triad-locked frame. Transitions between these states are hysteretic "snap" events triggered by a critical threshold, releasing a quantum of energy \(E_{snap}\) proportional to the mass involved.
  philosophy: |
    Ki unifies dynamics from the molecular to the cosmological by positing a single geometric mechanism—the tether-snap—as the metronome for all change. It asserts that inertia, chemical reactions, and even consciousness are expressions of the same underlying topological hysteresis, making the geometry of coherence the universal engine of action.
pirouette_definition: |
  A fundamental, dimensionless resonance constant quantifying phase evolution rate and coherence across spacetime fields. Ki exhibits two primary topological states: a rest value \(K_{i,\text{rest}} = \pi+1\) and a motion-induced, red-shift corrected value \(K_{i,\text{motion}} = 4\pi/3\). The hysteretic transition between these states, termed the "tether-snap" dynamic, constitutes a discrete "activation tick," the minimal event converting stored coherence into kinetic or chemical transformation.

      - name: Fringe Hysteresis Interferometry
        outline: |
          Construct a high-coherence, long-baseline interferometer. Modulate the velocity of the beam splitter or a target mirror relative to the laboratory frame, sweeping through a range of Lorentz factors (γ). The Ki-transition should induce a small, hysteretic centroid shift in the interference fringes as the system topology switches between the 4π and 2π manifolds. The magnitude of the shift will be proportional to ΔKi.
        expected_signals: [A small but sharp jump in fringe position at a critical velocity, a hysteresis loop in fringe position vs. velocity modulation]
        pitfalls: [Thermal noise overwhelming the small shift, insufficient velocity modulation to cross the snap threshold, gravitational lensing artifacts]
      - name: Reaction Time Quantization Analysis
        outline: |
          Analyze high-precision kinetic data from a simple, well-isolated chemical reaction (e.g., unimolecular decay). Create a histogram of the time intervals between individual reaction events. The Ki-snap model predicts these intervals will cluster around multiples of a fundamental timescale τ = h/(E_snap Ki), where E_snap is the activation energy.
        expected_signals: [Peaks in the time-interval histogram at integer or half-integer multiples of a base frequency]
        pitfalls: [Confounding quantum tunneling effects, insufficient time resolution in measurement, complex reaction pathways obscuring the primary signal]

It links to Time-Adherence (Ta) as the tempo of re-alignment and to Gladiator Force (Γ) as the energy scale of confinement.

The tiny ΔKi≈0.0472 encodes the geometric cost of triadic locking.

    excerpt: |
      At molecular and chemical scales, the snap defines the discrete **activation tick**: each bond rearrangement or phase flip is the minimal Ki-transition event converting stored coherence into motion. The same hysteresis that governs cosmic topology governs molecular kinetics, making Ki the metronome of transformation.

        The Lagrangian term for Ki is structurally analogous to an axion-like field's coupling to the electromagnetic Pontryagin density, \(\text{Tr}(F \wedge F)\). In this mapping, Ki acts like a dimensionless coupling constant for a topological term in electromagnetism. The dual-value "snap" could be interpreted as a first-order phase transition of the background field that Ki couples to.

    Ki is always a dimensionless constant near 4.1, never an energy variable. Context should distinguish it from *ki/chi*, as the Pirouette Framework usage is strictly mathematical and tied to coherence geometry, not vitalism.

# Ki Constant

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A fundamental, dimensionless resonance constant quantifying phase evolution rate and coherence across spacetime fields. Ki exhibits two primary topological states: a rest value \(K_{i,\text{rest}} = \pi+1\) and a motion-induced, red-shift corrected value \(K_{i,\text{motion}} = 4\pi/3\). The hysteretic transition between these states, termed the "tether-snap" dynamic, constitutes a discrete "activation tick," the minimal event converting stored coherence into kinetic or chemical transformation.

## EFT-First Summary
The Ki Constant can be provisionally mapped to the coupling constant of a topological term in an effective field theory of electromagnetism, analogous to an axion-photon coupling \(g_{a\gamma\gamma} a F\tilde{F}\). The defining Lagrangian term \(\tfrac{K_i}{\lambda_*}\varepsilon F\partial A\) suggests Ki governs the strength of interaction between standard EM fields and a background topological field. The observed dual-value nature of Ki implies this background field undergoes a first-order phase transition ("snap") between two distinct vacuum states, a phenomenon not present in the standard axion model but a testable prediction of the Pirouette Framework.
