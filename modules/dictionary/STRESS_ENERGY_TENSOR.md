        By varying the Action with respect to the spacetime metric g_ŒºŒΩ, we derive the system's stress-energy tensor. This tensor describes how the energy and momentum of the Coherence and Pressure fields act as the source of gravity, sculpting the geometry of spacetime itself. The dance shapes the stage.

    The dance shapes the stage. It is the weight and rhythm of the dancer's performance made manifest as the stage's warp and weft, telling spacetime itself how to curve in response.
  law: |
    The Stress-Energy Tensor `T_ŒºŒΩ` is the functional derivative of the total Pirouette Action `S` with respect to the inverse spacetime metric `g^ŒºŒΩ`, where `T_ŒºŒΩ = (2/‚àö-g) Œ¥S/Œ¥g^ŒºŒΩ`. Its covariant divergence vanishes, `‚àá^Œº T_ŒºŒΩ = 0`, enforcing local conservation of energy and momentum for the fundamental fields.
  philosophy: |
    This tensor makes the framework's autopoietic nature concrete: the fields do not exist *in* spacetime, they *generate* it. `T_ŒºŒΩ` closes the loop where the dynamics of Coherence and Pressure dictate the geometry, which in turn governs their propagation. There is no external, inert stage; only the self-creating dance.

  A symmetric rank-2 tensor that describes the density and flux of energy and momentum of the Coherence `(C)` and Temporal Pressure `(Œì)` fields. It is derived by variation of the invariant Action `S` with respect to the metric tensor `g_ŒºŒΩ` and serves as the source term in the field equations for gravity. `T_ŒºŒΩ` quantifies how the 'dance' of the fundamental fields shapes the 'stage' of spacetime.

        outline: |
          Observe the distortion of light (e.g., from the CMB or distant galaxies) as it passes through a region of spacetime. Use general relativistic inversion models to reconstruct the spacetime metric `g_ŒºŒΩ` that produced the observed lensing. Calculate the Einstein tensor `G_ŒºŒΩ` from the reconstructed metric. The Stress-Energy Tensor is then inferred via the field equations, `T_ŒºŒΩ = G_ŒºŒΩ / (8œÄG)`.

      With this invariant Action established, the derivation of all physical laws becomes a direct mathematical consequence. The Stress-Energy Tensor (`T_ŒºŒΩ`): By varying the Action with respect to the spacetime metric `g_ŒºŒΩ`, we derive the system's stress-energy tensor. This tensor describes how the energy and momentum of the Coherence and Pressure fields act as the source of gravity, sculpting the geometry of spacetime itself. The dance shapes the stage.

      justification: |
        The Pirouette `T_ŒºŒΩ` is defined identically to the standard Hilbert stress-energy tensor in General Relativity, derived by varying the matter action with respect to the metric. It represents the total energy-momentum contribution from the framework's fundamental scalar fields, `C` and `Œì`.

    - target: T_ŒºŒΩ (Hilbert Stress-Energy Tensor)
      rationale: |
        The term is adopted directly from General Relativity, as its definition, role as the source of gravity, and property of local conservation (`‚àá^Œº T_ŒºŒΩ = 0`) are identical. Pirouette simply specifies the content of `T_ŒºŒΩ` in terms of its own fundamental fields.

      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Cosmological observations (e.g., from Planck, DESI, Euclid) show an expansion history or large-scale structure formation that is irreconcilable with the equation of state derived from the effective fluid of the `C` and `Œì` fields."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the canonical Noether stress-energy tensor, which may not be symmetric or gauge-invariant. The Pirouette `T_ŒºŒΩ` is always the symmetric Hilbert tensor derived from variation of the metric, as this is the quantity that sources gravity.

# Stress-Energy Tensor

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A symmetric rank-2 tensor that describes the density and flux of energy and momentum of the Coherence `(C)` and Temporal Pressure `(Œì)` fields. It is derived by variation of the invariant Action `S` with respect to the metric tensor `g_ŒºŒΩ` and serves as the source term in the field equations for gravity. `T_ŒºŒΩ` quantifies how the 'dance' of the fundamental fields shapes the 'stage' of spacetime.

## EFT-First Summary
In General Relativity, the Stress-Energy Tensor `T_ŒºŒΩ` describes the distribution of energy and momentum that acts as the source for spacetime curvature. The Pirouette Framework adopts this definition directly, specifying that `T_ŒºŒΩ` arises from the dynamics of its two fundamental scalar fields: the Coherence Field `C` and the Temporal Pressure Field `Œì`. The specific form of the tensor is standard for a complex and a real scalar field, linking Pirouette's dynamics directly to measurable gravitational effects like cosmic expansion and gravitational lensing. (Ref: Wald, *General Relativity*).
