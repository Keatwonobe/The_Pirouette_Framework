  art: |
    The universe taps out a rhythm, and the particle dances in time. The beat is the sound of its steps, a measurable echo of its forced compliance with the changing geometry of the world.
  law: |
    A coherence manifold modulated at a given frequency ωₙ induces a periodic phase oscillation at a beat frequency fₑ in the interference pattern of a traversing quantum system. This fₑ is the direct, measurable rate of the system's dynamic re-optimization to maintain a geodesic of maximal coherence.
  philosophy: |
    The beat frequency transforms an abstract principle—Gladiator Confinement—into a concrete, measurable signal. It is direct proof of a conversation between a particle and its environment, showing that a system's state is not fixed but is a continuous, dynamic response to the landscape it inhabits.
pirouette_definition: |
  An oscillatory signal observed in the phase of a quantum interference pattern, resulting from the time-dependent modulation of the Temporal Pressure (Γ) field along a particle's path. This modulation, induced by mechanically rotating Γ-sculptors (e.g., helical gratings) at frequency ωₙ, forces the particle's Ki resonance to continuously re-optimize its trajectory. The beat frequency, fₑ, is the direct observable of this dynamic re-optimization, providing a quantitative test of Gladiator Confinement.

        outline: |
          A cold-neutron beam is directed through a Mach-Zehnder interferometer where each arm contains a helical silicon grating (Γ-sculptor). The gratings are mechanically rotated at a known angular frequency (ωₙ), creating a time-varying coherence manifold. The recombined neutron waves produce an interference pattern whose phase is monitored over time. A lock-in amplifier or Fourier analysis of the detector signal is used to isolate the beat frequency fₑ.

    excerpt: |
      The most profound test is a dynamic one. The helical gratings are mechanically rotated at a known frequency (ωₙ). This action creates a rhythmic, oscillating pulse in the structure of the local Temporal Pressure... This is a direct, controlled probe of the Gladiator Confinement principle (CORE-008). In response, the neutron's resonance must continuously adjust its path to maintain its geodesic of maximal coherence. This dynamic re-optimization will manifest as a measurable **beat frequency** in the interference pattern at the detector.

      **Confinement Modulation:** The gratings are rotated at a known frequency (ωₙ), creating a time-varying Γ field.
      **Resonance Detection:** A lock-in amplifier detects the resulting phase beat in the interference pattern, confirming the system's dynamic response as predicted by the Lagrangian.

        In systems with a time-periodic Hamiltonian (e.g., an atom in an oscillating electric field), the energy eigenstates (Floquet states) are modulated, creating sidebands in the energy spectrum. The Pirouette beat frequency is the observable consequence of a particle's Ki resonance being driven by a periodic modulation of the f(Γ) term in the Lagrangian, analogous to a periodic potential creating measurable beat notes between dressed states.

    In Pirouette, this term does not refer to the interference of two pre-existing, independent wave frequencies. It is an *emergent* frequency *induced* in a single quantum system's interference pattern by a time-varying external field (the modulated manifold). It is a response frequency, not a difference frequency.

# Beat frequency

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An oscillatory signal observed in the phase of a quantum interference pattern, resulting from the time-dependent modulation of the Temporal Pressure (Γ) field along a particle's path. This modulation, induced by mechanically rotating Γ-sculptors (e.g., helical gratings) at frequency ωₙ, forces the particle's Ki resonance to continuously re-optimize its trajectory. The beat frequency, fₑ, is the direct observable of this dynamic re-optimization, providing a quantitative test of Gladiator Confinement.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Pirouette Beat Frequency is analogous to phenomena observed in systems driven by a time-periodic potential, as described by Floquet theory in AMO physics. When a quantum system's environment is periodically modulated (e.g., an atom in an oscillating laser field), its energy levels can shift and develop sidebands, leading to observable oscillations. The Pirouette beat frequency is a similar emergent signal, interpreted as the system's dynamic response to a modulated geometric potential (Temporal Pressure) rather than an electromagnetic one.
