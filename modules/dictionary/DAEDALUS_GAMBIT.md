triad:
  art: |
    The physician’s touch that awakens the body's own healing. A key that turns not the lock but the river. The single note that resolves a storm of dissonance into harmony.
  law: |
    A Daedalus Gambit is a policy or action whose second-order positive effects on system coherence (measured in Vital Current flow rates and trust metrics) quantifiably exceed its first-order implementation costs. Any intervention with a leverage ratio (ΔC_D / Cost(Δ_g)) less than or equal to one is not a Gambit, but a brute-force expenditure.
  philosophy: |
    Effective governance is not the application of power, but the art of stewardship. The Daedalus Gambit reframes leadership from commanding a machine to healing a living system, shifting the objective from control to coherence. It seeks to shape the landscape of possibility so that the path of virtue becomes the path of least action.
pirouette_definition: |
  A strategic, high-leverage intervention within a Civic Manifold designed to restore laminar flow to one or more Vital Currents (Information, Resources, Trust). Unlike brute-force mandates, a Daedalus Gambit acts as a catalyst, enabling the system to self-correct by resolving a specific flow pathology (Sclerosis, Fever, or Atrophy) and generating a net positive Coherence Dividend.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (denotes a class of action). Its effect is measured by the Coherence Dividend, C_D.

    - name: Δ_g
      meaning: A Daedalus Gambit intervention.
      dimensions: dimensionless (an operator)
      default_range: N/A
    - name: C_D
      meaning: Coherence Dividend; the net surplus of trust, resources, and attention generated by the intervention.

      - name: Gambit Leverage Assessment
        outline: |
          1. Diagnose a specific Civic Pathology (Sclerosis, Fever, or Atrophy) in one or more Vital Currents using Caduceus Lens diagnostics.
          2. Identify the critical bottleneck, dissonance source, or point of decay. Propose a minimal, precise intervention (the Gambit, Δ_g) to address it.
          3. Quantify the direct implementation cost, Cost(Δ_g), in terms of resources, political capital, and attention.
          4. Measure or model the change in flow metrics post-intervention (e.g., Gini coefficient for Resource Sclerosis, political polarization indices for Information Fever, public trust surveys for Trust Atrophy).
          5. Calculate the resulting Coherence Dividend (C_D) and determine the leverage ratio: C_D / Cost(Δ_g). A successful gambit must have a ratio significantly greater than 1.
        expected_signals: [Reduced political polarization metrics, increased velocity of money, higher institutional trust scores, decreased bureaucratic latency.]
        pitfalls: [Misdiagnosis of the core pathology leading to wasted effort, unforeseen second-order consequences (Cobra effect), political capture of the intervention.]

    excerpt: |
      The goal of governance is to restore laminar flow. This is not achieved through brute force, but through the **Daedalus Gambit**: a clever, precise intervention that helps the system heal itself. To treat Sclerosis, one must dissolve the dam. To treat Fever, one must introduce a harmonizing signal. To treat Atrophy, one must reinforce the channel.
  - module: DOMA-044
    excerpt: |
      A dysfunctional manifold creates a misalignment where a citizen must degrade the collective's coherence (through exploitation, corruption, or deception) to maximize their own. This misalignment is the fundamental source of all societal pathology. The mandate of the civic physician is to shape a landscape where virtue is the easiest path to walk.

        dx/dt = f(x, u) where ||u|| is small but ∫ L(x(t)) dt is large.
      justification: |
        A Daedalus Gambit is analogous to a minimal but precisely targeted control input (u) in a complex nonlinear system (x). Instead of overpowering the system's dynamics (f(x)), it leverages them by targeting a sensitive point (a bifurcation point or unstable equilibrium) to steer the system's trajectory toward a more desirable state attractor (higher coherence).

    - statement: "A successful Daedalus Gambit increases the long-term Coherence Dividend of a social system by an amount greater than its implementation cost."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "An intervention classified as a Daedalus Gambit is implemented, and post-facto analysis over a relevant timescale (e.g., 5-10 years) shows a net decrease in system coherence metrics or that its positive effects decayed faster than its cost could be amortized."

  disambiguation: |
    The term 'Gambit' implies a calculated risk with high potential payoff, not a guaranteed success. It is distinct from a brute-force 'Mandate' or 'Decree', which seeks to compel an outcome directly through coercive power rather than enabling a healthier dynamic to emerge systemically.
