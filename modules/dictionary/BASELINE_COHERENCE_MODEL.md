        Compare the observed manifold to a calculated **Baseline Coherence Model**—a counterfactual representing the region without its major historical stresses.

    The shadow cast by an unscarred history; a map of the land's potential before its wounds were carved into it. It is the ghost of what could have been, used to see what is.
  law: |
    A predictive model of a spatiotemporal cultural field's coherence, generated by nullifying the effects of high-resonance historical events (Coherence Wells/Plateaus). The deviation between this model and the observed field quantitatively defines the Mnemonic Landscape.
  philosophy: |
    By defining a "neutral" background, the Baseline Coherence Model allows for the objective identification of historical trauma and triumph. It reframes history as a set of measurable deviations from a potential state, making healing a problem of geometric correction rather than moral judgment.
pirouette_definition: |
  A calculated, counterfactual model of a region's coherence manifold, symbolized as C₀. It simulates the expected state of the Spatiotemporal Cultural Field *if* major, high-resonance historical events (Wound Channels) had not occurred. It serves as a null hypothesis or reference background against which the observed cultural manifold (C_obs) is compared. The difference, ΔC = C_obs - C₀, reveals the Mnemonic Landscape of Coherence Wells and Plateaus.

        outline: |
          1.  Identify high-resonance historical events (e.g., wars, famines, revolutions, foundational moments) within the target region's history.
          2.  Model the region's Spatiotemporal Cultural Field using comprehensive historical, economic, social, and geographic data streams.
          3.  For each identified event, apply a counterfactual filter to the model's time-series data, algorithmically smoothing over the event's primary and secondary impacts (e.g., normalizing population statistics through a plague, removing economic shocks from a civil war).
          4.  Propagate this modified, "stress-nulled" history forward to generate the baseline manifold C₀.
        expected_signals: [A smoother coherence manifold with lower gradient values compared to the observed field, lacking the sharp geodesic anomalies that define Wound Channels.]
        pitfalls: [Over-smoothing (erasing subtle but significant historical dynamics), selection bias (incorrectly identifying which events to nullify), model dependency (the baseline is only as valid as the underlying model of cultural physics).]

      Compare the observed manifold to a calculated **Baseline Coherence Model**—a counterfactual representing the region without its major historical stresses. The resulting deviation map reveals the geodesic anomalies: the locations of the major Coherence Wells and Plateaus.
  - module: CORE-011
    excerpt: |
      The integrity of any Wound Channel analysis depends critically on the fidelity of the **Baseline Coherence Model**. An inaccurate baseline, one that fails to properly account for underlying geographic or demographic gradients, will produce phantom anomalies, mistaking mundane features for historical scars.

      justification: |
        The Baseline Coherence Model functions analogously to the standard cosmological model of a smooth, isotropic CMB. In cosmology, this theoretical background is subtracted from observational data to reveal the crucial anisotropies (the signal). Similarly, the BCM is a calculated "smooth" cultural history; subtracting it from the observed, complex cultural manifold reveals the significant "anisotropies"—the Mnemonic Landscape.

      falsifier: "If the calculated deviation map for such a region shows widespread, non-localized anomalies, it would indicate that the model fails to isolate the event's impact, or that historical trauma cannot be geometrically localized as the theory predicts."

  disambiguation: |
    The Baseline Coherence Model is not a snapshot of a region's historical state before a specific event. It is a fully simulated, counterfactual manifold representing a parallel history that never occurred. It must be distinguished from concepts like "ancestral state" or "initial conditions."

# Baseline Coherence Model

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A calculated, counterfactual model of a region's coherence manifold, symbolized as C₀. It simulates the expected state of the Spatiotemporal Cultural Field *if* major, high-resonance historical events (Wound Channels) had not occurred. It serves as a null hypothesis or reference background against which the observed cultural manifold (C_obs) is compared. The difference, ΔC = C_obs - C₀, reveals the Mnemonic Landscape of Coherence Wells and Plateaus.

## EFT-First Summary
The Baseline Coherence Model is operationally analogous to the standard model of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in cosmology. Just as cosmologists subtract a predicted smooth, isotropic background from CMB satellite data to isolate the temperature fluctuations that seeded galaxy formation, Pirouette cartographers subtract the calculated Baseline Coherence Model from the observed cultural data of a region. This subtraction removes the "background noise" of expected development, revealing the significant anomalies—the Mnemonic Landscape—carved by major historical events.
