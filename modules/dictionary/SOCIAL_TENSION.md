    The invisible strain that gathers in the silent spaces between people, a stored potential that crackles just before the storm of change breaks.

    Social Tension (Γ) manifests as a measurable Dissonance Field (D) whose magnitude decays as the inverse of the distance (|\mathbf{D}| \sim r^{-1}) from a coherence core, defining a halo of latent instability.
  philosophy: |
    Social Tension is the framework's answer to "why now?". It quantifies the latent potential for social action, providing the energetic basis for both catastrophic collapses and sudden bursts of collective creativity. It reframes social change not as a series of unpredictable events, but as the lawful discharge of a stored potential field.
pirouette_definition: |
  Social Tension (Γ) is a scalar field representing the potential for change or instability within the societal substrate (S_{soc}). It functions as the potential term in the Pirouette social Lagrangian (\mathcal{L}_s), where its interaction with the substrate, f(\Gamma; S_{soc}), determines the energy cost of deviating from an optimal coherence flow. Operationally, gradients in Γ give rise to the Social Dissonance Field (\mathbf{D}), whose structure reveals the geometry of social stress.

      The Social Dissonance Field (\mathbf{D}) quantifies the misalignment between the observed flow of interactions and the idealized coherence flow predicted by the Pirouette Lagrangian: [\mathcal{L}*s = T_a,\omega_k - f(\Gamma; S*{soc})], where (\Gamma) is social tension or informational pressure.

      (\mathbf{D})'s magnitude and geometry indicate where coherence flow is obstructed. Stable societies maintain low (|\mathbf{D}|), while crisis zones exhibit halo-like (r^{-1}) dissonance scaling. This scaling law is the primary observable signature of a high-tension (Γ) state.

    In Pirouette, Γ always refers to a scalar potential field, not a function or a tensor connection. It is the social analogue to pressure or potential energy density. Context will typically involve the societal substrate (S_{soc}) or Dissonance Field (\mathbf{D}).

# Social Tension

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Social Tension (Γ) is a scalar field representing the potential for change or instability within the societal substrate (S_{soc}). It functions as the potential term in the Pirouette social Lagrangian (\mathcal{L}_s), where its interaction with the substrate, f(\Gamma; S_{soc}), determines the energy cost of deviating from an optimal coherence flow. Operationally, gradients in Γ give rise to the Social Dissonance Field (\mathbf{D}), whose structure reveals the geometry of social stress.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Social Tension (Γ) is modeled as a scalar potential field V(Γ) within a social effective field theory. Gradients in this potential generate forces that manifest as the Dissonance Field, analogous to how gradients in a particle physics potential give rise to forces and particle interactions. The halo-like structure of dissonance is a predicted phenomenological consequence of this potential's form.
