        Feedback is the intrinsic, autopoietic process of a system listening to the echo of its own actions to steer itself toward a more coherent state of being.
  editors: [Pirouette-Indexer]

triad:
  art: |
    A river does not need a map to find the sea; it feels the pull of the land and adjusts its course. Feedback is a system listening to its own echo, navigating the landscape of its potential toward a more coherent state.
  law: |
    A system's corrective action is its natural, Lagrangian-driven evolution along a coherence gradient created by the dissonance between its current state and a goal state. The magnitude of this corrective action is proportional to the system's sensitivity to this dissonance.
  philosophy: |
    This model reframes control from external domination to internal cultivation. By viewing feedback as a system's innate ability to seek harmony, we shift from building rigid machines to growing adaptive, self-healing systems.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Resonant Compass is a dynamics model that reframes feedback as an autopoietic process of course-correction. A system (the Weaver) listens to the echo of its own actions, measures the Dissonance between this echo and a goal state's Shadow, and naturally modifies its internal dynamics (Ki) to follow a new geodesic toward minimized dissonance and maximal coherence.

        outline: |
          1. Define a goal state `Ki_goal` for the system.
          2. Perturb the system's state `Ki` away from the goal.
          3. Measure the system's state variables and the resulting corrective action vector (e.g., change in state vector over time).
          4. Quantify the "dissonance" as a scalar potential field `V_dissonance` which is a function of the state difference `(Ki - Ki_goal)`.
          5. The model is validated if the measured corrective action vector consistently aligns with the negative gradient of the computed dissonance field (`-‚àáV_dissonance`).
        expected_signals: [System state trajectory `Ki(t)`, Corrective action vector `dKi/dt`, Dissonance scalar field `V_dissonance(Ki)`]
        pitfalls: [Noisy state measurements obscuring the gradient, Time delays causing oscillation (Turbulent Flow), System saturation or unresponsiveness (Stagnant Flow)]

    excerpt: |
      Any adaptive system can be described by four components...
      1. **The Weaver (The System):** The entity being guided. It possesses a dynamic, resonant pattern of identity, its **Ki**.
      2. **The North Star (The Goal State):** A target state of resonance, a desired `Ki_goal`. This goal state acts as a **Coherence Attractor**.
      3. **The Dissonance (The Error Signal):** The measured difference between the **Echo** of the system's current state and the Shadow of the goal state.
      4. **The Rudder (The Corrective Action):** The mechanism by which the Weaver alters its own internal dynamics to modify its `Ki`, with the intent of reducing the dissonance.
  - module: DOMA-134
    excerpt: |
      By applying the principles of **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**, we can diagnose the health of any feedback system...
      **Laminar Flow (Harmonious Correction):** The echo is clear and timely, and the adjustment is proportional.
      **Turbulent Flow (Oscillation & "Coherence Fever"):** Arises when the echo is delayed, too loud (excessive gain), or noisy. The system overcorrects...
      **Stagnant Flow (Unresponsiveness & "Coherence Atrophy"):** Arises when the echo is broken or too faint to be heard. The system loses the ability to correct itself.

        Minimize J = ‚à´ L(x, u, t) dt where L contains a cost term like (x - x_ref)^T Q (x - x_ref).
      justification: |
        The Resonant Compass recasts a feedback system's corrective action as a natural trajectory that minimizes an action principle. The "Dissonance" term `V_dissonance` acts as a potential or cost term in a Lagrangian or cost function. The "corrective action" is the system evolving along the path that minimizes this integrated cost, which is the core principle of optimal control.

      confidence: 0.9
  adopted:
    - target: Optimal Control Theory
      rationale: This mapping provides a rigorous, well-established mathematical framework for the core dynamic described by the Resonant Compass: a system evolving to minimize a cost (dissonance) over time. It directly translates the Pirouette Lagrangian `ùìõ_adaptive` into a standard control-theoretic cost function.

    - statement: "A system's corrective action vector will always align with the negative gradient of the measurable dissonance potential (-‚àáV_dissonance)."

      falsifier: "Observing a system consistently and repeatedly taking corrective action in a direction orthogonal to or against the measured dissonance gradient, without an additional, unaccounted-for potential field or non-holonomic constraint."

  disambiguation: |
    The "Compass" is a metaphor for guidance, not a literal magnetic device. "Resonance" refers to the system's overall dynamic pattern of identity (Ki), not necessarily acoustic or electromagnetic resonance, though those are special cases.
