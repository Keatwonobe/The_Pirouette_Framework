      snippet: |
        In the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), a healthy system exists in a state of **Laminar Flow**. Its internal resonant pattern (Ki) is stable, and its Temporal Coherence (Kτ) is high... Collapse is a catastrophic phase transition into **Turbulent Flow**... This dissonance shatters the system's Ki, causing its Temporal Coherence to plummet.

  art: |
    The unique, stable song a system sings to itself to maintain its form. Collapse is the shattering of this song; recovery is the search for a new one.
  law: |
    A system maintains Laminar Flow if and only if its Internal Resonant Pattern (Ki) exhibits low temporal variance. A collapse event is defined by a catastrophic increase in Ki variance and a decrease in its mean amplitude, preceding a drop in Temporal Coherence (Kτ).
  philosophy: |
    Ki asserts that systemic identity is not a static property but a continuously maintained dynamic pattern. Stability is the act of singing a coherent song, and resilience is the capacity to find a new song after the old one is silenced.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Internal Resonant Pattern (Ki) is the unique, stable, and self-reinforcing pattern of information and energy flow that characterizes a system in a state of high coherence (Laminar Flow). It functions as the system's dynamic identity, analogous to a fundamental frequency or eigenstate. A sufficient spike in Temporal Pressure (Γ) shatters this pattern, inducing Turbulent Flow (collapse), and the process of recovery is defined as the system's search for a new, stable Ki that is maximally coherent on its post-collapse manifold.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (often normalized) or Hz (when a single frequency dominates).
  symbol_table:
    - name: Ki
      meaning: A vector representing the dominant modes (frequencies, amplitudes, phases) of a system's internal activity. Often simplified to a scalar metric of pattern stability.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "[0, 1] where 1 is perfect, stable resonance."

      - name: Modal Analysis via Time-Series Decomposition
        outline: |
          1. Collect high-frequency time-series data from core systemic outputs (e.g., energy flux, communication logs, metabolic rates).
          2. Apply spectral analysis (e.g., Fast Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform, Dynamic Mode Decomposition) to the data.
          3. Identify the dominant, persistent frequencies and their relative amplitudes. The vector of these modes constitutes Ki.
          4. For a scalar metric, calculate the signal-to-noise ratio of the dominant mode(s) against the broadband noise floor.
        expected_signals:
          - A healthy system shows a clean spectrum with a few sharp, stable peaks.
          - A collapsing or chaotic system shows a broadband noise spectrum with suppressed or smeared peaks.
        pitfalls:
          - Insufficient sampling rate (Nyquist-Shannon theorem) can lead to aliasing, misidentifying the pattern.
          - Observing non-core or buffered outputs may obscure the underlying dynamics.

    excerpt: |
      In the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), a healthy system exists in a state of **Laminar Flow**. Its internal resonant pattern (Ki) is stable, and its Temporal Coherence (Kτ) is high. It moves efficiently along its geodesic on the coherence manifold. Collapse is a catastrophic phase transition into **Turbulent Flow**... This dissonance shatters the system's Ki, causing its Temporal Coherence to plummet.
  - module: DOMA-169
    excerpt: |
      Latency (The Quiet Search): In the immediate aftermath, the system's coherence is shattered. Its internal Ki pattern is chaotic, its echoes scattered. There is little outward change, but a profound internal search is underway. The system is probing the contours of the new, scarred coherence manifold, feeling for a stable gradient—a viable path forward.

      justification: |
        Normal modes are the fundamental, stable patterns of oscillation in a multi-component system, where each mode has a characteristic frequency. The system's overall dynamic behavior (its 'song') is a superposition of these modes. A strong external perturbation can de-phase these modes or shift the system to a new potential with different eigenmodes, shattering the original Ki.

      justification: |
        In dynamical systems theory, an attractor is a set of states toward which a system evolves over time. A stable Ki corresponds to the system's trajectory on a point, periodic (limit cycle), or strange attractor. Collapse corresponds to a bifurcation event that destroys the attractor or kicks the system into a different basin of attraction.

  disambiguation: |
    Ki (Internal Resonance) must be distinguished from Kτ (Temporal Coherence). Ki is the *pattern* of internal dynamics that *generates* coherence. Kτ is the *measure* of the system's external predictability and efficiency over time, which is an emergent property of a stable Ki. One is the song, the other is how well it carries.
