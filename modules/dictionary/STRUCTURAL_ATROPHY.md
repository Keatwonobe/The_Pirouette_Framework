        **Structural Atrophy (Stagnation):** A critical coherence channel becomes blocked, starving downstream components and creating a dangerous pressure build-up upstream. *Manifestations:* A broken supply chain link; a single point of failure in a network; a rigid dogma that prevents a theory from evolving. This is failure by **blockage**.

  art: |
    A river choked by its own ambition. The pressure builds behind a silent dam, not as a roar, but as a deep, resonant hum that promises a flood.
  law: |
    Structural Atrophy is present when a persistent negative divergence of coherence flow (∇·J_K < 0) is measured in a downstream region, coupled with a persistent positive divergence (∇·J_K > 0) upstream of a specific structural node, indicating a blockage. In equilibrium, the total system coherence flow is not conserved locally, leading to pressure concentration and downstream decay.
  philosophy: |
    A system's greatest threat is not external force but internal constipation. Atrophy reveals that failure often arises from a refusal to let go, to allow flow, locking a system into a brittle, high-pressure state that mistakes stasis for stability.
pirouette_definition: |
  A structural failure pathology characterized by the blockage of a critical coherence channel. This obstruction prevents the flow of coherence (e.g., resources, information, physical load) to downstream components, causing them to starve and decay, while creating a dangerous accumulation of localized Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) at the point of blockage. It is a failure mode defined by stagnation and results from a geometric or systemic constriction within the system's Architecture of Coherence.

        outline: |
          1. Identify the system's critical coherence geodesics (channels for load, information, resources).
          2. Deploy sensors or proxies to measure the flow rate (J_K) at points upstream (P_up) and downstream (P_down) of a suspected blockage.
          3. Calculate the local divergence as (Flow_in - Flow_out) / Volume across the node.
          4. A persistent, non-zero divergence—positive upstream and negative downstream—confirms atrophy.

    excerpt: |
      The connections between components are not mere links, but channels. A well-designed structure creates paths of least resistance, riverbeds carved to guide the water. Their purpose is to foster **Laminar Flow** (`DYNA-001`), ensuring that energy and information move through the system with maximum efficiency and minimal friction. The health of a channel determines the fidelity with which coherence can flow from one node to another.

        R → ∞  implies I → 0
      justification: |
        Structural Atrophy models a channel's inability to conduct coherence, analogous to an open circuit where resistance (impedance) approaches infinity. This halts the flow of current (coherence) and causes a potential difference, or voltage (pressure), to build up across the blockage.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        In biological systems, an occlusion blocks blood flow, starving downstream tissues of oxygen (coherence) and increasing pressure upstream, potentially leading to an aneurysm (catastrophic failure). This provides a direct physical analogy for the dynamics of stagnation, starvation, and pressure build-up.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from **Structural Erosion**, which is the slow decay of the channel's carrying capacity, not a discrete blockage within it. Differentiate from **Structural Fever**, which is a system-wide resonant instability (turbulence), not a localized blockage (stagnation). Atrophy is about *where* flow stops; Fever is about *how* it oscillates.
