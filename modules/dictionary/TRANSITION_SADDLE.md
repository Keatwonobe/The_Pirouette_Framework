        Transition Saddles: The pathways between these peaks are lower-lying "saddles" on the manifold. To transition from one mode to another, a system must traverse one of these regions of lower coherence, temporarily entering a state of controlled turbulence.

triad:
  art: |
    A mountain pass between familiar valleys; a moment of chaotic potential where one song ends and another has yet to begin. It is the turbulent, necessary wilderness a system must cross to find a new home.
  law: |
    A transition saddle is a first-order saddle point on the Coherence Manifold, representing the path of minimum Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) that connects two adjacent Modal Basins. The ùìõ_p value at the saddle point defines the upper bound for the inter-modal Stability Depth (Œîùìõ_p).
  philosophy: |
    Change is not a featureless void but a structured landscape. Saddles reveal that the cost of becoming something new is finite, measurable, and potentially negotiable, transforming change from a brute fact into a strategic variable.
pirouette_definition: |
  A topological feature of the Coherence Manifold defined as a saddle point of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p). It represents a state of minimal but non-zero coherence that acts as a dynamic gateway between two or more stable Modal Basins. Traversing a saddle is a necessary condition for a system to undergo a phase leap, and its height relative to an adjacent peak defines that mode's Stability Depth (Œîùìõ_p).

        outline: |
          1. Reconstruct the Coherence Manifold by computing the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) over a representative sample of the system's state space.
          2. Identify local maxima on the manifold, corresponding to Modal Basins (Ki_m).
          3. For a pair of adjacent basins, use a numerical path-finding algorithm (e.g., Nudged Elastic Band) to identify the Minimum Coherence Path (MCP) between them.
          4. The point of maximum ùìõ_p along this MCP corresponds to the transition saddle. Its value is ùìõ_p,saddle.
        expected_signals: [low coherence score (ùìõ_p), high state variance, turbulent flow diagnostics]
        pitfalls: [Insufficient state space sampling can miss saddles or create numerical artifacts. High system dimensionality makes path-finding computationally expensive.]

  - module: DOMA-185
    excerpt: |
      A phase leap is typically initiated by a perturbation sufficient to push the system off its peak and over a transition saddle. [...] A transition can also be induced with surgical precision. By introducing a signal that resonates with a *target* mode's `Ki_m`, it is possible to lower the Transition Cost for that specific pathway...

        Œîùìõ_p = ùìõ_p,peak - ùìõ_p,saddle  <=>  E_a = E_TS - E_reactants
      justification: |
        In chemical kinetics, the transition state is the configuration of highest potential energy along the reaction coordinate. A Transition Saddle is a direct analogue, where the Coherence Manifold replaces the potential energy surface and the Pirouette Lagrangian replaces energy. The Stability Depth (Œîùìõ_p) is functionally identical to the activation energy (E_a).

    - statement: "All spontaneous transitions between distinct, stable Modal Basins must pass through a first-order transition saddle on the Coherence Manifold."
      domain: theory|phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observing a direct, repeatable transition between two stable modes (A and B) where the system's trajectory on the Coherence Manifold does not cross a saddle point. This would imply a non-geodesic 'tunneling' mechanism not described by the Pirouette Lagrangian dynamics."

  disambiguation: |
    A Transition Saddle is a feature of the instantaneous Coherence Manifold, representing a dynamic pathway *between* modes. Do not confuse with a 'Wound Channel' (CORE-011), which is a historical modification that deepens a Modal Basin *itself*, increasing its inertia over time.
