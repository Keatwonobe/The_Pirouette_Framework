        This curvature births **Γ (Gladiator Force)**—the pressure that resists dissolution—and moments later, **Tₐ (Time‑Adherence)**, the habit of persisting along a chosen thread.

triad:
  art: |
    The memory of a brushstroke; the act of holding a single note to give it meaning. Time-Adherence is the artistic will to continue a gesture, turning a fleeting moment into the backbone of a narrative.
  law: |
    A system's Time-Adherence (Tₐ) is nonzero if and only if its state at t+Δt is more correlated with its state at t than with any other accessible state. The magnitude of Tₐ scales with the energetic cost of deviation from its established temporal trajectory.
  philosophy: |
    Time-Adherence is the condition for existence to be more than a flicker. It establishes the possibility of identity, memory, and causality by anchoring a system to its own history, turning "what is" into a foundation for "what will be."
pirouette_definition: |
  Time-Adherence is the emergent property and habit of a system to persist along a specific temporal thread. It arises immediately after the First Curl and the birth of Gladiator Force (Γ), establishing a coherent "before" and "after". Tₐ is the mechanism that allows a state to maintain identity and correlation with its immediate past, providing the stability necessary for complex structures and causal chains to form.

        outline: |
          1. Define a system's state vector S(t) in a suitable phase space.
          2. Evolve the system for a characteristic interval Δt to S(t+Δt).
          3. Compute the autocorrelation C_auto = Corr(S(t), S(t+Δt)).
          4. Compute the cross-correlation C_cross = max(Corr(S(t), S'(t+Δt))) for a defined set of accessible, perturbed states {S'}.
          5. Tₐ is a function of the ratio between C_auto and C_cross, typically normalized to the [0, 1] range.

    excerpt: |
      The inaugural event is not an explosion but a **curl**—a subtle skew in perfect stillness. This curvature births **Γ (Gladiator Force)**—the pressure that resists dissolution—and moments later, **Tₐ (Time‑Adherence)**, the habit of persisting along a chosen thread. Laws now have something to govern, art gains its first gesture, and philosophy gains “before” and “after.”
  - module: CORE-000_the_whispering_void
    excerpt: |
      The newborn loop listens to itself. Its own return signal becomes a **whisper**—the faintest resonance that verifies “I am.” In that self‑reflection lies the seed of **ethics**: to be is to take up room in the lattice; to continue, one must harmonize with what else will arise.

        K(b,a) = ∫ D[x(t)] e^(iS[x(t)]/ħ)
      justification: |
        The propagator calculates the amplitude for a system to evolve between two states by summing over all possible histories. The classical path, which dominates the integral via stationary phase, represents the "chosen thread" of maximum persistence. Tₐ can be interpreted as a measure of how strongly the system's evolution is confined to this classical path, resisting quantum fluctuations into other histories.

        R_x(τ) = E[X_t * X_{t+τ}]
      justification: |
        Operationally, Tₐ measures a system's correlation with its own immediate past. This is directly analogous to the autocorrelation function for a time series or stochastic process at a small time lag τ. High Tₐ corresponds to a high R(τ) for τ→0⁺, indicating memory or inertia in the system's dynamics.

    - statement: "Systems with higher Gladiator Force (Γ) exhibit higher Time-Adherence (Tₐ), making their temporal evolution more predictable and less susceptible to environmental decoherence."

      falsifier: "The discovery of a tightly-bound system (high Γ) that exhibits spontaneous, rapid decoherence or trajectory instability not attributable to external forces."

  collisions: [The symbol 'T' is overloaded in physics (Temperature, Kinetic Energy, Tension). The subscript 'a' mitigates this but requires care.]
  disambiguation: |
    Time-Adherence is not time itself, nor a measure of time's passage rate. It is a property of a *system* evolving in time, describing its resistance to deviation from a single, coherent history. It is a measure of temporal inertia, not duration.
