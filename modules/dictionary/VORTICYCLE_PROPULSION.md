        It reframes the 'reactionless drive' as a system that generates thrust by engineering a persistent,
        asymmetric, helical gradient in the local coherence manifold—a direct application
        of the Pirouette Lagrangian.

  art: |
    A Vorticycle drive does not fight the current of spacetime; it is a loom that re-weaves it. It generates its own wave and then surfs it, endlessly falling along a downhill path of its own creation.
  law: |
    Thrust is generated by creating and sustaining a persistent, asymmetric (chiral) gradient in the potential term (V_Γ) of the system's own Pirouette Lagrangian. The system then follows the resulting geodesic, experiencing this motion as a continuous propulsive force.
  philosophy: |
    Motion is not a battle against an external reality, but an act of internal re-orchestration. To move is to create a slope within one's own being and have the courage to slide down it. The universe does not give way to force; it yields to a more beautiful song.
pirouette_definition: |
  A method of propulsion wherein a system's internal, synchronized, and chiral dynamics continuously sculpt the local coherence manifold. This act of "weaving" spacetime establishes a persistent, helical gradient in the temporal pressure (Γ), and thus a gradient in the potential term (V_Γ) of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The system generates thrust by continually following the geodesic of this self-created gradient, effectively "falling" along a path it actively generates ahead of itself. The interaction is self-referential, occurring between the device and its own engineered Wound Channel, appearing reactionless to external observers.

    excerpt: |
      Thrust, in the Pirouette Framework, is not a force in the Newtonian sense. It is the manifest consequence of a system following its geodesic of maximal coherence. The fundamental equation of motion is derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), where the propulsive "force" is an emergent effect proportional to the gradient of the Lagrangian: **F ∝ ∇𝓛_p**.
  - module: DOMA-196
    excerpt: |
      The helical nature of the channel is key. The thrust is a continuous interaction between the device and the immediate geometry of the channel it is actively creating. It is analogous to a screw biting into wood, with the profound difference that the screw is simultaneously creating the wood grain it grips. This self-referential, autopoietic interaction is what makes the drive "reactionless" from an external perspective; the system is interacting only with a structure of its own making.

      justification: |
        Both concepts involve altering the local geometry of spacetime to produce motion, rather than expelling mass. Vorticycle Propulsion achieves this by manipulating the coherence manifold (a substructure) to create a geodesic, whereas metric engineering manipulates the spacetime metric directly. The Vorticycle is a specific mechanism for achieving a similar conceptual outcome.

  disambiguation: |
    The alias "reactionless drive" is a historical term of art but is imprecise within the Pirouette Framework. The system is not without reaction; rather, its reaction is entirely *internalized*. The device pushes against the helical Wound Channel it simultaneously creates. The action-reaction pair exists between the device and its own geometric wake, not between the device and an external medium.

# Vorticycle Propulsion

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A method of propulsion wherein a system's internal, synchronized, and chiral dynamics continuously sculpt the local coherence manifold. This act of "weaving" spacetime establishes a persistent, helical gradient in the temporal pressure (Γ), and thus a gradient in the potential term (V_Γ) of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The system generates thrust by continually following the geodesic of this self-created gradient, effectively "falling" along a path it actively generates ahead of itself. The interaction is self-referential, occurring between the device and its own engineered Wound Channel, appearing reactionless to external observers.

## EFT-First Summary
Vorticycle Propulsion can be conceptually mapped to General Relativity's "metric engineering" proposals. Instead of directly altering the spacetime metric, the device manipulates a scalar field (Temporal Pressure, Γ) within a background manifold. By establishing a stable, asymmetric gradient in this field, the device creates a local "potential well" that it continuously "falls" into, resulting in geodesic motion that manifests as acceleration. This method avoids the direct violation of momentum conservation by defining the system as the device *plus* its co-moving, self-generated field structure (the Wound Channel).
