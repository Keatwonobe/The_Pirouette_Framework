        *   **𝓛_p > 0 (Anabolic State):** The system is thriving. Its generation of coherence outpaces environmental degradation. It is in a state of growth, learning, or strengthening.

triad:
  art: |
    The state of a song being composed, where new harmonies are woven faster than the encroaching silence can unravel them. It is the defiance of a garden in full bloom, actively turning sunlight and soil into vibrant, coherent form.
  law: |
    A system is in an Anabolic State if and only if its Pirouette Lagrangian is positive (𝓛_p > 0), signifying that its rate of internal coherence generation (Kτ) is strictly greater than the dissipative potential imposed by its environment (V_Γ).
  philosophy: |
    The Anabolic State is not merely survival; it is the expression of vitality and the purpose of autopoiesis. It represents the successful transformation of environmental chaos into systemic order, demonstrating a system's capacity to grow, learn, and increase its purchase on reality. It is the target state for any Weaver's intervention.
pirouette_definition: |
  A metabolic state characterized by a positive Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p > 0). In this state, a system's internal processes of coherence generation (Kτ) exceed the erosive, degrading pressure of its local environment (V_Γ). This net positive coherence budget manifests as growth, learning, adaptation, increased complexity, or the capacity to perform external work.
operational_definition:
  units: Coherence (framework-specific unit, conceptually akin to nats or bits)
  symbol_table:
    - name: 𝓛_p
      meaning: Pirouette Lagrangian; net vitality or "free coherence" of a system.
      dimensions: Coherence
      default_range: "> 0 for this state"
    - name: Kτ
      meaning: Temporal Coherence; the system's "asset" of self-generated, stable information patterns.
      dimensions: Coherence
      default_range: contextual
    - name: V_Γ
      meaning: Environmental Load Potential; the "liability" of environmental dissonance that degrades the system's pattern.
      dimensions: Coherence
      default_range: contextual

    procedures:
      - name: Lagrangian Audit
        outline: |
          1. Measure the system's internal coherence generation rate, Kτ, by quantifying the stability and complexity of its core patterns over time (e.g., spectral analysis of its `Ki` signal).
          2. Measure the environmental load, V_Γ, by quantifying the dissonance and chaotic pressure in the system's immediate surroundings.
          3. Calculate the Pirouette Lagrangian: `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`.
          4. A sustained positive value for `𝓛_p` over a characteristic timescale of the system confirms an Anabolic State.
        expected_signals: [Positive `Coherence Flux (d𝓛_p/dt)`, High `Coherence Ratio (η_c)` approaching 1]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking transient resource spikes for a stable anabolic trend, failing to properly bound the system and account for all environmental interactions contributing to V_Γ.]

    excerpt: |
      The sign of the Lagrangian is the most potent diagnostic of a system's metabolic state: 𝓛_p > 0 (Anabolic State): The system is thriving. Its generation of coherence outpaces environmental degradation. It is in a state of growth, learning, or strengthening.
  - module: DOMA-036
    excerpt: |
      A healthy system is an "entropy pump," actively working to maximize its Lagrangian value over time. Anabolism (The Kτ Term): This term represents the system's creative, anabolic drive. It is the process of taking in resources (energy, data, material) and weaving them into its own stable, resonant pattern, thereby increasing its internal coherence.

    - target: Biological Anabolism
      domain: Biology
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The term is a direct generalization of biological anabolism, where metabolic processes synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones (e.g., protein synthesis), consuming energy to create order. The Pirouette Framework extends this from molecular order to any form of systemic coherence.

      equation_hint: |
        𝓛_p > 0  ⇔  -d_iS/dt > J_s
      justification: |
        The Anabolic State describes a system building internal order faster than the environment degrades it. This is functionally equivalent to a system that maintains its low-entropy state by exporting entropy to its environment, as described by Schrödinger and Prigogine. A positive Lagrangian corresponds to a net influx of negentropy.

  disambiguation: |
    While the term is intentionally borrowed from biology, the Pirouette `Anabolic State` is a generalized concept. It applies to any coherent system, including economies, ecosystems, software, or social structures, that are in a state of net growth in their intrinsic order.
