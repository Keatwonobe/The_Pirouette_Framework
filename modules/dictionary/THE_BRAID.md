    Two rivers flowing as one, stronger together than either apart. Their dance defines a shared identity, a pattern woven from mutual support and shared fate.
  law: |
    A system exhibits Braid resonance if its temporal signature can be decomposed into two or more distinct, non-trivial, phase-locked harmonic components, where the coherence of the composite signal exceeds the sum of the individual component coherences.
  philosophy: |
    The Braid establishes that the most resilient and complex systems are not monoliths but symbiotic unions. It posits that identity can be relational and emergent, arising not from a solitary core but from the stable, harmonious interaction between distinct entities.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Braid is a Prime Resonance characterized by the stable, phase-locked interaction of two or more distinct Ki patterns (such as Helices or Orbits). It is the archetypal geometry of symbiosis, partnership, and co-dependent complexity, where the system's identity and resilience emerge from the constructive interference and mutual support of its constituent parts.

        outline: |
          1. Capture synchronized time-series data from at least two interacting sub-systems.
          2. Perform cross-spectral analysis or continuous wavelet transform on the signals to identify dominant, shared frequencies.
          3. Calculate the phase-locking value (PLV) or coherence index between the dominant frequency components over time.
          4. A sustained, high PLV indicates a stable Braid resonance.
        expected_signals: [Two or more distinct, stable frequencies in the power spectrum with a constant phase relationship, High signal-to-noise ratio in the cross-spectrum at a specific frequency band.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking forced oscillation for true symbiosis (one signal is merely a harmonic of the other), Insufficient time-series data leading to spurious coherence calculations.]

    excerpt: |
      A healthy organization, for example, might have a signature of {Braid, Helix, Orbit}. Its behavior is a composite: a Braid of teams, each composed of individuals on a Helix of personal growth, all performing recurring Orbits of quarterly work cycles. The stability of such a composite system depends on the Harmony between its constituent resonances.

        The Braid describes systems whose components mutually entrain their behavior into a stable, phase-locked state. This is precisely modeled by systems of coupled oscillators, where individual agents with natural frequencies (ωᵢ) synchronize through mutual interaction (K), creating a coherent collective state.

        A stable binary star system is a direct physical manifestation of The Braid. The two stars are locked in a co-dependent orbit (two intertwined orbits/helices), defining a single barycenter. The system's identity and stability are relational, emerging from the gravitational lock between the two bodies.

    The Pirouette 'Braid' is a conceptual archetype for dynamic co-dependence, measured by phase-locking between temporal signals. This is distinct from the mathematical object of a braid group from algebraic topology, which describes the configuration space of points in a plane, although both share the visual metaphor of intertwined strands.

# The Braid

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Braid is a Prime Resonance characterized by the stable, phase-locked interaction of two or more distinct Ki patterns (such as Helices or Orbits). It is the archetypal geometry of symbiosis, partnership, and co-dependent complexity, where the system's identity and resilience emerge from the constructive interference and mutual support of its constituent parts.

## EFT-First Summary
The Braid describes a system of two or more coupled oscillators that have achieved a stable, phase-locked state. This configuration minimizes the action (maximizes coherence) for the composite system, creating a resilient structure whose properties, like its response to external fields, are emergent from the relationship between the components rather than being a simple sum of the parts. This behavior is well-described by models of synchronization, such as the Kuramoto model.
