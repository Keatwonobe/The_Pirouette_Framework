triad:
  art: |
    A quarantined list of shadows, paradoxes, and broken causal chains. It is the known void around which a coherent story of discovery can be woven.
  law: |
    A Dissonance Ledger must explicitly and publicly list all known paradoxes, missing causal links, and unexplained phenomena related to a pathology. Any proposed narrative must demonstrably address or shrink this list to be considered valid.
  philosophy: |
    To prevent premature closure and intellectual hubris. By formalizing what is *not* known, the Ledger transforms ignorance from a source of failure into a structured and falsifiable roadmap for inquiry.
pirouette_definition: |
  A formal, version-controlled list of known unknowns, paradoxes, missing causal links, and unexplained phenomena associated with a specific pathology or system disruption. It is a mandatory component of The Daedalus Gambit (`DOMA-097`), serving to quarantine the mystery, prevent premature conclusions, and provide a concrete set of questions that any proposed explanatory narrative must address.

          1.  Using diagnostic tools like The Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`), map all observable system disruptions and their known causal chains.
          2.  Systematically review all available data, models, and literature regarding the pathology.
          3.  Identify and list all observations that contradict established models or expectations.
          4.  Enumerate all missing causal steps required to link observed phenomena (e.g., "What is the initial trigger?").
          5.  Consolidate these items into a versioned, publicly accessible list.

        Both are formal, versioned lists of known problems, inconsistencies, and unexpected behaviors in a complex system. They serve as a public roadmap for focused investigation and resolution, and are updated as problems are solved or better understood. The goal is to methodically reduce the number of open, high-priority issues.

  disambiguation: |
    This term is distinct from a simple list of symptoms or data points. The Ledger specifically documents the *gaps*, *paradoxes*, and *missing causal links* between data points, not the data itself. It is a meta-document about the state of knowledge.

# Dissonance Ledger

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A formal, version-controlled list of known unknowns, paradoxes, missing causal links, and unexplained phenomena associated with a specific pathology or system disruption. It is a mandatory component of The Daedalus Gambit (`DOMA-097`), serving to quarantine the mystery, prevent premature conclusions, and provide a concrete set of questions that any proposed explanatory narrative must address.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, a Dissonance Ledger functions like a formal issue tracker for a physical system. Instead of software bugs, it lists empirical paradoxes and gaps in causal understanding. Its purpose is to guide the process of model-building by ensuring that new theories (e.g., a "Coherence Narrative") explicitly address and resolve the documented inconsistencies, thereby serving as a disciplined tool for scientific discovery.
