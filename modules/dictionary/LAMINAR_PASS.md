triad:
  art: |
    To separate the sound of the river from the sound of the rocks. The art is creating a quiet space where a desired melody can be heard, by building a net that catches only the ringing of coherent bells.
  law: |
    A filtering operation that retains only those data segments whose local Temporal Pressure (Γ) is less than or equal to a defined upper threshold (Γ_high). All other segments are discarded.
  philosophy: |
    The purpose is not merely to remove "disorder," but to selectively listen for the presence of sustained, meaningful patterns. It is an act of identifying systems that have successfully maximized their Lagrangian (Kτ > VΓ) and found a stable, geodesic path.
pirouette_definition: |
  A filtering principle of the Coherence Sieve that isolates a system's coherent signal by selectively retaining only those temporal segments exhibiting laminar flow. Operationally, it keeps segments where the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) is below a specified threshold, effectively selecting for "coherence sanctuaries"—regions where a system's internal coherence (Kτ) dominates environmental dissonance (VΓ).
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (boolean pass/fail per segment); output stream units match input stream units.
  symbol_table:
    - name: Γ
      meaning: Local Temporal Pressure; a measure of dissonance or chaos in a data segment.
      dimensions: Information per time (e.g., s⁻¹)
      default_range: "contextual; >0"
    - name: Γ_high
      meaning: The upper threshold for Temporal Pressure. Segments with Γ > Γ_high are discarded.
      dimensions: Information per time (e.g., s⁻¹)
      default_range: "contextual; must be specified"

        outline: |
          1.  **Segmentation:** Divide the input data stream into discrete, equal-length segments.
          2.  **Quantification:** For each segment, calculate its local Temporal Pressure (Γ), typically using Shannon Entropy as a proxy.
          3.  **Sieving:** Compare each segment's Γ to the predefined Γ_high threshold.
          4.  **Output:** Retain and concatenate only the segments where Γ ≤ Γ_high to form the new, filtered data stream.

    excerpt: |
      A **Laminar Pass** selects for "coherence sanctuaries"—regions where systems successfully maximize their Lagrangian. Their internal coherence (`K_τ`) is strong enough to overcome the environmental temporal pressure (`V_Γ`), resulting in a stable, observable pattern. We are filtering for systems that have found their geodesic.

    excerpt: |
      **Signal Processing:** The Sieve performs a *Laminar Pass* to isolate a coherent signal (e.g., a clear voice) from a turbulent background (e.g., crowd noise).
      **Text & Idea Analysis:** A *Laminar Pass* can isolate the structural, low-entropy grammar and syntax of a document...

      justification: |
        A Laminar Pass removes high-"dissonance frequency" (chaos, high entropy) to allow low-"dissonance frequency" (coherence, order) signals to pass through. This is functionally identical to a low-pass filter in the frequency domain, which removes high-frequency oscillations to reveal an underlying trend or signal. The filtered quantity is entropy/dissonance rather than temporal frequency.

  claims:
    - statement: "For a signal composed of a low-entropy carrier and high-entropy noise, applying a Laminar Pass with an appropriate Γ_high will increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the output stream."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "An instance where the filter consistently decreases SNR or introduces artifacts more disruptive than the original noise, even with optimal threshold tuning."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a simple moving average or smoothing function. A Laminar Pass is a *selective* (gating) filter, not an *integrating* one; it discards entire turbulent segments rather than averaging them into their neighbors. This preserves the temporal fidelity and crispness of the retained laminar segments.
