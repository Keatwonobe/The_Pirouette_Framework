    The shape of a riverbed tells the story of the river. A system's hierarchy is the static map of its dynamic history, a record of its search for stable, coherent states, etched into the geometry of its structure.
  law: |
    The distribution of influence or activity in any coherently evolving system will converge toward a power-law hierarchy, where the exponent (Coherence Gradient α) quantifies the system's emergent balance between efficiency and resilience.
  philosophy: |
    History is not just a sequence of events but a physical force that carves a landscape of influence. By reading this landscape, one can diagnose a system's character and identify the resonant patterns that define its future possibilities.
pirouette_definition: |
  Structural Memory is the persistent, hierarchical organization of a system's components, which emerges as a physical consequence of its dynamic history. This structure, observable as a power-law distribution of influence, activity, or rank, reflects the system's cumulative search for coherence, encoding the relative stability and dominance of its Resonant Attractors.

          1. Collect rank-frequency data from a system's activity log or a census of its components (its "coherence trace").
          2. Plot the data on a log-log scale to visually confirm the power-law relationship.
          3. Calculate the Coherence Gradient (α) from the raw data using a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for accuracy.

    excerpt: |
      This module reframes the statistical phenomenon of a power-law (or Zipfian) distribution as the tangible footprint of a system's underlying coherence dynamics. This is not a curve-fitting exercise; it is a diagnostic protocol for identifying a system's Resonant Attractors—the highly stable, efficient patterns that capture the majority of its flow—and for quantifying the steepness of their influence, a property we term the Coherence Gradient.
  - module: DOMA-145
    excerpt: |
      The emergence of a specific Coherence Gradient `α` is not an accident; it is a solution. The observed distribution is the equilibrium state a system has found that maximizes the integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) over time. The value of `α` reflects the system's optimal balance between maximizing internal coherence (`K_τ`) and enduring the external pressures (`V_Γ`) of its environment.

        The framework defines Structural Memory as the physical phenomenon whose mathematical description is a power-law distribution.

# Structural Memory

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Structural Memory is the persistent, hierarchical organization of a system's components, which emerges as a physical consequence of its dynamic history. This structure, observable as a power-law distribution of influence, activity, or rank, reflects the system's cumulative search for coherence, encoding the relative stability and dominance of its Resonant Attractors.

## EFT-First Summary
Structural Memory is the physical system property whose observable distribution follows a power-law, `f(r) ∝ 1/r^α`. The exponent `α` is treated as a key physical parameter (the Coherence Gradient) that describes the steepness of the system's influence hierarchy. This operationalizes a statistical feature as a primary diagnostic for systemic properties like stability and efficiency, analogous to how critical exponents characterize phases of matter in statistical mechanics.
