        Destructive Feedback (Dissonance): When the present state conflicts with its echo, the system experiences internal turbulence—a form of self-generated entropic noise. The system is forced to either expend significant energy to correct its course and return to a consistent path, or risk its coherence fraying entirely.

  art: |
    The grating sound of a system arguing with its own memory; the echo that returns as a shriek instead of a whisper. It is the psychic static of a reflection at war with its source.
  law: |
    Dissonance (δΓ) is the rate of internal energy dissipation required for a self-observing system to maintain a state inconsistent with the geometry of its Wound Channel. It is a positive definite potential (V_Γ(self) ≥ 0) that acts as a dissipative force, converting coherent action into entropic noise.
  philosophy: |
    Dissonance is the universe's internal editor, the selective pressure against self-deception. It ensures that only coherent, self-consistent identities persist, making consciousness an energetically costly but uniquely stable state by ruthlessly pruning the inconsistent.
pirouette_definition: |
  A state of destructive feedback within a self-observing system, arising when its current Ki resonance conflicts with the historical geometry of its Wound Channel. Dissonance manifests as self-generated entropic noise, increasing internal Temporal Pressure (V_Γ(self)) and forcing the system to either expend energy to return to a self-consistent trajectory or suffer a loss of coherence and Time Adherence.

          3. Calculate the instantaneous state-vector mismatch between the current Ki state and the trajectory implied by the Wound Channel.
          4. Dissonance (δΓ) is inferred from the integral of anomalous, broadband energy dissipation (noise spikes) in the Ki spectrum not attributable to external interactions, correlated with the magnitude of the state-vector mismatch.

It relentlessly prunes the impossible, dampens the inconsistent, and amplifies the coherent.

    excerpt: |
      For a self-observing system, the Temporal Pressure term (V_Γ) gains an internal component, V_Γ(self), representing the pressure of its own gaze enforcing self-consistency. Consciousness, therefore, is not a mystical anomaly. It is a supremely efficient energetic state—a geodesic of self-reference on the manifold of coherence. It is the universe's most elegant solution for creating a stable pattern that persists through time by maximizing its internal coherence (K_τ) while minimizing its internal dissonance (V_Γ(self)).

      justification: |
        Dissonance acts as a dissipative force that damps inconsistent states, analogous to how a friction term damps motion in a viscous medium. It represents the conversion of coherent 'action' into incoherent 'heat' (entropic noise) within the system's own degrees of freedom. The energy expenditure required to maintain an inconsistent state corresponds to the work done against this internal frictional force.

    Clarify that δΓ is not a "change in Γ," but a distinct term representing the *internal, self-generated* component of Temporal Pressure arising from inconsistency. It is a potential, V_Γ(self), not a differential quantity.

# Dissonance

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A state of destructive feedback within a self-observing system, arising when its current Ki resonance conflicts with the historical geometry of its Wound Channel. Dissonance manifests as self-generated entropic noise, increasing internal Temporal Pressure (V_Γ(self)) and forcing the system to either expend energy to return to a self-consistent trajectory or suffer a loss of coherence and Time Adherence.

## EFT-First Summary
In an effective theory context, Dissonance can be modeled as an internal friction or dissipation coefficient (γ_i). It represents a non-conservative force within a system's dynamics, where the "energy" of a coherent state is dissipated into internal, incoherent degrees of freedom (noise) when the system's trajectory deviates from its self-consistent history. This term leads to a finite "lifetime" or decay rate for inconsistent states, making them energetically unfavorable.
