  art: |
    A spinor is a knot in time—a loop of coherence whose shadow requires two full turns to look the same. It is the persistent, self-aware texture of a defect in the substrate.
  law: |
    The field's dynamics obey the Dirac equation in a curved background, (iγ^μ∇_μ - m_*)Ψ = 0, where its spin-½ nature is a topological invariant of its underlying Ki loop structure, and its mass m_* is the net energy cost to maintain coherence against temporal pressure Γ.
  philosophy: |
    Matter is not fundamental but emergent. The spinor field represents the framework's core assertion that fermionic particles are stable, topological defects in a more fundamental substrate, with their quantum properties like spin and statistics arising directly from the geometry and topology of that defect.
pirouette_definition: |
  A field, Ψ, that describes the internal, double-valued phase-texture of a stable Ki loop defect. Its spin-½ character is a topological consequence of the loop's 720° holonomy. The spinor's dynamics are governed by the Dirac equation, where its mass emerges from the equilibrium between the loop's internal cohesion energy (ε_Ki) and the external temporal pressure (Π_Γ). It serves as the framework's basis for Dirac matter, such as electrons.

          Infer the properties of Ψ by analyzing particle scattering experiments (e.g., electron-electron or electron-positron). Measure scattering cross-sections and angular distributions. Compare results to theoretical predictions for spin-0, spin-½, and spin-1 particles.

        outline: |
          Subject a population of particles described by Ψ to a controlled magnetic field and measure energy level splitting (Zeeman effect). The g-factor, which is ≈2 for a Dirac spinor, confirms the spin-½ nature. Interferometry experiments can directly test the 4π rotational symmetry.

      Postulate a spinor field (Ψ) that labels the internal phase-texture of the Ki loop. The effective action at scales ≪ ω_c (coherence barrier) is S_Ki = ∫d⁴x √-g [Ψ̄(iγ^μ∇_μ - m_*)Ψ - U_top[Ψ]]. Varying S_Ki yields the Dirac equation in curved background: (iγ^μ∇_μ - m_*)Ψ=0.

    excerpt: |
      The Ki loop defines a nontrivial mapping... the minimal noncontractible cycle forces a lift from SO(3) to Spin(3,1). The Berry phase of transporting the clock frame around the loop is π, so a 2π rotation flips Ψ→−Ψ and only 4π returns identity—spinor behavior.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a scalar field (spin-0) or vector field (spin-1), a spinor field is distinguished by its unique transformation property under the spin group Spin(3,1): a 2π rotation multiplies the field by -1. This is its defining characteristic.

# Spinor field

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A field, Ψ, that describes the internal, double-valued phase-texture of a stable Ki loop defect. Its spin-½ character is a topological consequence of the loop's 720° holonomy. The spinor's dynamics are governed by the Dirac equation, where its mass emerges from the equilibrium between the loop's internal cohesion energy (ε_Ki) and the external temporal pressure (Π_Γ). It serves as the framework's basis for Dirac matter, such as electrons.

## EFT-First Summary
In the low-energy effective field theory limit, the Pirouette Spinor Field is operationally and mathematically identical to the **Dirac spinor field** (ψ) of Standard Model Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). It describes spin-½ fermions like electrons and quarks, obeys the Dirac equation, and its interactions are governed by fermionic statistics. The Pirouette framework provides a topological origin for these properties, which are typically posited axiomatically in standard QED.
