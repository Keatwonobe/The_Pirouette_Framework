    The graviton is the medium’s cleanest whisper, a transverse shiver of the loom. When it grazes a Γ-lighthouse, it does not change its voice—only its timing.
  law: |
    A gravitational wave propagating through a gradient in the temporal pressure (Γ) accumulates a phase shift `Δφ_GW` proportional to the square of its frequency (`ω^2`) and the path integral of the squared Γ-gradient. This effect is polarization-agnostic, affecting `+` and `×` modes equally, and is a leading-order correction to vacuum propagation.
  philosophy: |
    The Γ-lighthouse effect transforms gravitational waves from mere messengers of distant cataclysms into active probes of the intervening spacetime substrate. By measuring a frequency-dependent time delay, we can map the "stiffness" of the vacuum, revealing the structure of the temporal medium that General Relativity assumes to be featureless. It is a primary observable for falsifying vacuum propagation and confirming the physical reality of the Coherence-Preserving Manifold.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Γ-lighthouse is a phenomenon where a gravitational wave (GW) acquires a cumulative, frequency-dependent phase shift as it traverses a region with a spatially varying temporal pressure profile, `Γ(r)`. This phase imprint arises from the interaction of the GW's transverse-traceless (TT) modes with the underlying substrate of the Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM). The effect scales as `(ω/ω_c)^2`, where `ω` is the GW frequency and `ω_c` is the characteristic frequency of the medium, manifesting as a measurable dephasing of the waveform without introducing new polarizations.

          1. Acquire a high signal-to-noise ratio, broadband GW signal (e.g., from a binary black hole merger).
          2. Perform a phase-coherent analysis, comparing the arrival time of high-frequency components relative to low-frequency components.
          3. Fit the observed phase evolution to a model including a term that scales with `ω^2`, in addition to the standard GR template.
          4. The coefficient of the `ω^2` term provides a measurement of `κ/ω_c^2 ∫ [∂_r Γ(r)]^2` integrated along the line of sight.

        The modified dispersion relation ω² ≈ k²(1 + ζ(k/ω_c)²) is a direct result of adding operators like `(∂_α∂_β h_{ij})²` to the quadratic action.
      justification: |
        The Γ-lighthouse effect arises from `O((ω/ω_c)^2)` corrections to the GW action. In an effective field theory framework, such terms are represented by higher-derivative operators suppressed by a high energy scale (here, `ω_c`). These operators explicitly break local Lorentz invariance for propagating modes above the IR limit.

  disambiguation: |
    The term "lighthouse" does not imply a rotating beam. It is a metaphor for a fixed beacon (the GW source) whose light signal (the GW) is distorted or delayed by the intervening medium (the varying Γ-profile), allowing one to probe that medium. The effect is on the timing and phase, not the directionality.

# Γ-lighthouse

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Γ-lighthouse is a phenomenon where a gravitational wave (GW) acquires a cumulative, frequency-dependent phase shift as it traverses a region with a spatially varying temporal pressure profile, `Γ(r)`. This phase imprint arises from the interaction of the GW's transverse-traceless (TT) modes with the underlying substrate of the Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM). The effect scales as `(ω/ω_c)^2`, where `ω` is the GW frequency and `ω_c` is the characteristic frequency of the medium, manifesting as a measurable dephasing of the waveform without introducing new polarizations.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of Effective Field Theory, the Γ-lighthouse effect corresponds to a higher-derivative, Lorentz-violating operator in the gravitational action, such as `(∂²h)² / ω_c²`. This term modifies the graviton propagator and leads to a non-trivial dispersion relation `ω² ≈ k²(1 + ζ(k/ω_c)²)`. The deviation from standard General Relativity is suppressed by the medium's characteristic frequency scale `ω_c`, making it an experimental target for high-frequency gravitational wave astronomy. This provides a direct, operational mapping between the Pirouette framework's `Γ`-profile and established formalisms for testing fundamental physics.
