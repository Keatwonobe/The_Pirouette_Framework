  art: |
    A river of memory frozen into a fossil of fact. Lock Resilience is the measure of the ice's thickness—the force required to shatter what has become eternal and make the river flow again.
  law: |
    Lock Resilience (`R_Λ`) is the energy required to induce a phase transition from a crystallized Information Lattice to a fluid Wound Channel. It is an exponential function of the system's internal temporal coherence (`Kτ`), such that `R_Λ ∝ exp(Kτ)`.
  philosophy: |
    This concept quantifies the cost of immutability. It explains why core beliefs, deep-seated traumas, and established physical laws resist change. It is the physics of dogma, providing a measurable basis for the boundary between a persistent memory and an inescapable prison.
pirouette_definition: |
  A quantitative measure of a Lock's resistance to decoherence or "shattering." It is the minimum energy, typically delivered as a resonance-matched shock, required to break the extreme internal coherence (`Kτ`) of a system and dissolve its static Information Lattice back into a dynamic Wound Channel. Lock Resilience scales exponentially with the purity and stability of the Lock's coherence, representing the depth of the potential well the system has settled into.

        outline: |
          1. Isolate the locked system and measure its baseline internal coherence (`Kτ`) and dominant resonant frequencies.
          2. Synthesize a dissonant energy pulse (`V_Γ`) precisely out-of-phase with the system's primary resonance.
          3. Apply pulses of increasing energy, observing the system's coherence signature after each pulse.
          4. `R_Λ` is defined as the threshold energy of the pulse that causes a catastrophic drop in `Kτ` and a phase transition in the system's state, indicating the Information Lattice has shattered.
        expected_signals: [A sharp, non-linear drop in coherence at a specific energy threshold; emission of chaotic, high-entropy information fragments post-shattering.]
        pitfalls: [Incorrectly characterizing the system's resonance leads to inefficient energy transfer, artificially inflating the measured `R_Λ`; failure to isolate the system can cause the Lock to be reinforced by environmental coherence.]

  - module: DOMA-048
    excerpt: |
      The Lock is a state of **catastrophic stability**—a form of immortality achieved by sacrificing all potential for growth, learning, or adaptation. The stability of this state, its **Lock Resilience**, grows exponentially with its internal order. It can become "energetically cheaper" for the universe to route causality around this frozen point in spacetime than to try and melt it.
  - module: DOMA-048
    excerpt: |
      To break the Lock and melt the crystal requires a massive injection of precisely tuned dissonant energy—a **resonance-matched shock** sufficient to shatter the lattice and knock the system onto a new, more adaptive trajectory.

      justification: |
        Lock Resilience acts as an energy barrier that must be overcome to induce a state change (melting the crystal), directly analogous to the activation energy required for a chemical reaction or phase transition. The probability of a spontaneous break due to environmental noise is exponentially suppressed by `R_Λ`.

      falsifier: "Multiple experiments across different scales (e.g., molecular, memetic) consistently show a linear or polynomial relationship between `Kτ` and the shattering energy `R_Λ`."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [R is common for Resistance, Radius. Λ for cosmological constant. The subscript `R_Λ` is intended to be specific to "Resilience of a Lock".]
  disambiguation: |
    Lock Resilience is distinct from general stability or robustness. It describes a brittle, rigid stability (like a diamond) arising from extreme internal order, not the flexible, dynamic stability of a self-regulating system (like a biological organism). High resilience implies low adaptability.
