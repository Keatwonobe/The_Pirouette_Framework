  art: |
    The crystalline tapestry of becoming, woven thread by thread from atomic events. Each stitch is a causal link, forming the discrete, dynamic ground of all existence. It is the structure that grows, not the stage on which things move.
  law: |
    The fundamental structure of spacetime is a locally finite, strict partially ordered set E = (V, ≺), where V are events and ≺ is the causal precedence relation. All physical quantities are functions on E and its sub-structures (motifs).
  philosophy: |
    Fabric replaces the smooth, passive manifold of general relativity with an active, computational substrate. It asserts that reality is built from discrete causal relations, not from points in a pre-existing container, making dynamics a process of structural growth rather than motion through a background.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Fabric, denoted E, is a locally finite, strict partially ordered set (poset), E = (V, ≺). The set V consists of elements called events, and the relation ≺ represents direct or transitive causal precedence. "Locally finite" means that for any two events u ≺ v, the set of events z such that u ≺ z ≺ v (the causal interval between u and v) is finite. Fabrics are the fundamental substrate upon which all Pirouette dynamics are defined.

        outline: |
          The discrete structure of the Fabric is not directly observable at macroscopic scales. It is inferred by measuring its emergent, large-scale properties, primarily the effective metric tensor g_μν and gauge fields A_μ. These classical fields are identified as statistical averages of local Fabric invariants (e.g., interval counts, holonomy defects) over a coarse-graining volume, as defined by the Order→Manifold bridge functor (F).

        The Order→Manifold bridge functor F maps a large, sufficiently random Fabric E to an effective Lorentzian manifold. The metric tensor g_μν is a statistical property derived from local invariants like interval densities and chain populations within E. This is the primary correspondence principle connecting the discrete substrate to classical general relativity.

    Unlike the metaphorical 'fabric of spacetime' in popular science, a Pirouette Fabric is not a continuous sheet or ether. It is a discrete, directed, acyclic graph (specifically, a poset) of causal relations. Continuous properties like distance and time are emergent statistical averages over this structure, not fundamental postulates.

# Fabric

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Fabric, denoted E, is a locally finite, strict partially ordered set (poset), E = (V, ≺). The set V consists of elements called events, and the relation ≺ represents direct or transitive causal precedence. "Locally finite" means that for any two events u ≺ v, the set of events z such that u ≺ z ≺ v (the causal interval between u and v) is finite. Fabrics are the fundamental substrate upon which all Pirouette dynamics are defined.

## EFT-First Summary
In the low-energy limit, the Fabric (E) is modeled as a continuous 4D Lorentzian manifold (M, g_μν). The discrete causal links and event density of the Fabric give rise to the metric tensor g_μν, and its dynamical growth, governed by the Action (S), is expected to reproduce the Einstein field equations in a statistical limit. In this view, gravity is not the curvature of a fundamental continuum, but the emergent thermodynamics of the Fabric's causal structure.
