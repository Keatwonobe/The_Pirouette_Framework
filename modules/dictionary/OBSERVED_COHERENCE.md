    The unedited footage of the system's performance, the raw sound of its song. It is the territory itself, captured in data, against which all maps are judged.
  law: |
    Observed Coherence is the empirically measured Temporal Coherence of a system, calculated from a time-series of its state variables. It serves as the ground-truth term in the Coherence Deficit equation, `ŒîK_œÑ(t) = K_œÑ_obs(t) ‚àí K_œÑ_pred(t)`.
  philosophy: |
    This term grounds the entire Pirouette Framework in empiricism. Without an honest, rigorous measurement of what *is*, any model of what *should be* is an untestable fantasy. Observed Coherence is the framework's commitment to the reality of the system, not the elegance of the model.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Observed Coherence, `K_œÑ_obs(t)`, is the time-dependent measure of a system's actual Temporal Coherence, computed directly from empirical data representing the system's state trajectory. It quantifies the degree of coordinated, resonant behavior the system *actually exhibits* in the real world, serving as the benchmark against which a model's predicted coherence (`K_œÑ_pred(t)`) is compared to calculate the Coherence Deficit.

          1. Define the system's state space and identify key observable state variables.
          2. Collect time-series data for these variables over a representative interval.
          3. Apply the appropriate coherence metric (e.g., spectral coherence, mutual information rate, phase-locking value) across the relevant variables to compute the instantaneous coherence `K_œÑ_obs(t)`.
          4. Aggregate or smooth the result as needed for the required time scale.

        In control theory, the measured output of a plant or process, `y(t)`, is the ground truth used to calculate the error signal against a desired setpoint. `K_œÑ_obs(t)` plays an analogous role as the "measured reality" component in the Coherence Deficit calculation.

        In statistical modeling and machine learning, a model's performance is evaluated by comparing its predictions (`≈∑`) to the observed empirical data (`y`). `K_œÑ_obs(t)` is the Pirouette Framework's analogue for this observed data, serving as the basis for calculating the model's residual or "deficit".

# Observed Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Observed Coherence, `K_œÑ_obs(t)`, is the time-dependent measure of a system's actual Temporal Coherence, computed directly from empirical data representing the system's state trajectory. It quantifies the degree of coordinated, resonant behavior the system *actually exhibits* in the real world, serving as the benchmark against which a model's predicted coherence (`K_œÑ_pred(t)`) is compared to calculate the Coherence Deficit.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Observed Coherence maps to the empirical data or measurement outcome in a validation process. It is the set of observed facts (`y`) used to calculate the residual (`y - ≈∑`) against a model's prediction (`≈∑`), providing the error signal for model refinement. In control theory, it is analogous to the measured system output `y(t)` that is compared against a reference or setpoint.
