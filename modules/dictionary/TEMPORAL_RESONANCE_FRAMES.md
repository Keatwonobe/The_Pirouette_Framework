    Maxwell came from one clock. Yang–Mills comes from many clocks that must agree at once—a moving scaffold of temporal frames whose curvature is the force itself. Rotate the scaffold in two directions out of order and you create a field: the non-Abelian memory of how time’s basis failed to commute.
  law: |
    The energy density of the temporal medium scales quadratically with the curvature of the local temporal-resonance frame, yielding the Yang–Mills Lagrangian L = -¼ F^a_{μν}F^{a,μν}. The gauge coupling constant g is a direct measure of this frame stiffness.
  philosophy: |
    Non-Abelian gauge symmetry is not a fundamental axiom but an emergent consequence of degeneracy in the temporal medium. The mathematical structure of a principal bundle is given a physical embodiment as the set of all possible local basis choices for these degenerate modes. The forces are the medium's response to maintain coherence across these choices.
pirouette_definition: |
  A redundant, non-unique basis of degenerate internal resonance modes within the temporal medium. At each spacetime point x, the choice of a local frame U(x) from an internal resonance group G (e.g., SU(2), SU(3)) represents a gauge freedom. Promoting this local relabeling freedom to a symmetry requires a connection field A_μ, and the medium's resistance to frame-twisting (stiffness) generates the Yang–Mills energy term.

        outline: |
          The properties of a temporal-resonance frame (its group G and stiffness g) are indirectly measured by observing the dynamics of its associated gauge bosons. In a particle collider, measure scattering cross-sections for processes that depend on gauge boson self-interaction, such as W⁺W⁻ → W⁺W⁻ or gluon-gluon scattering into multi-jet final states. The results are compared to predictions from the Yang–Mills Lagrangian to extract the coupling g and confirm the non-Abelian vertex structure, which reflects the curvature of the frame bundle.

        The set of all possible temporal-resonance frames at all spacetime points forms a principal G-bundle over the spacetime manifold M. A specific gauge field configuration is a connection on this bundle, defining how to compare frames at infinitesimally separated points. This provides a direct physical interpretation for the abstract bundle structure of gauge theory.

    Distinguish from a General Relativistic 'frame' (a basis for the tangent space, e.g., a tetrad), which relates to local spacetime geometry and the principle of equivalence. A temporal-resonance frame is a basis for a degenerate *internal* space of the temporal medium, defining an internal (gauge) symmetry, not a spacetime one.

# Temporal-resonance frames

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A redundant, non-unique basis of degenerate internal resonance modes within the temporal medium. At each spacetime point x, the choice of a local frame U(x) from an internal resonance group G (e.g., SU(2), SU(3)) represents a gauge freedom. Promoting this local relabeling freedom to a symmetry requires a connection field A_μ, and the medium's resistance to frame-twisting (stiffness) generates the Yang–Mills energy term.

## EFT-First Summary
Temporal-resonance frames provide a physical origin for the principal G-bundle of non-Abelian gauge theory. The gauge freedom corresponds to the local choice of basis for degenerate modes in a posited sub-quantum medium. The gauge connection A_μ is the field required to compare these frames locally, and the Yang-Mills Lagrangian L = -¼ F² arises from the medium's "stiffness"—an energy cost associated with variations in the frame orientation. This mechanism is proposed to generate the SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories of the Standard Model from physical properties of the medium.
