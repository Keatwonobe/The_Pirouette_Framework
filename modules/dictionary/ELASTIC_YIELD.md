        1. **Elastic Yield (Adaptive Flow):** The system temporarily alters its resonant pattern to accommodate the stress, bending but not breaking. It successfully manages the high coherence cost within a strained but stable **Laminar Flow**. When the pressure (`Œì`) subsides, it returns to its original form, its identity intact. This is the regime of resilience.

    A reed bending in the wind, a bow drawn taut before the arrow flies. It is the system's capacity to hold a question without breaking, to dance with pressure and return to its own song.
  law: |
    A system subjected to Temporal Pressure (Œì) exhibits Elastic Yield if, upon removal of the pressure, its resonant identity (Ki) returns to its initial state with no measurable loss of Temporal Coherence (KœÑ). State-path hysteresis is minimal or zero.
  philosophy: |
    Elastic Yield is the dynamic signature of resilience. It is the primary mechanism by which a system absorbs environmental shocks without sacrificing its identity, distinguishing robustness from both brittle fragility and costly, permanent adaptation.
pirouette_definition: |
  A temporary, reversible response to elevated Temporal Pressure (Œì) where a system alters its configuration to manage a high coherence cost (V_Œì) without exceeding its coherence budget (KœÑ). This process occurs within a stable Laminar Flow state. The system's core resonant identity (Ki) is preserved, and it returns to its original state once the external pressure subsides.

    excerpt: |
      Is the system robust? Does it possess the coherence to absorb expected pressures without losing its identity? This is the diagnostic question for the Weaver when observing a system that adapts elastically. Such a system bends but does not break, efficiently managing stress and returning to form when pressure is relieved.

        Elastic Yield is the Pirouette Framework's information-theoretic generalization of classical elastic deformation. Both describe a non-permanent deformation under load with a full return to the original state upon unloading. The Pirouette model recasts this mechanical process as a universal dynamic of a system managing its coherence budget against environmental cost.

    Elastic Yield must be distinguished from Plastic Yield. Elastic Yield is a *temporary* alteration where the system's identity is preserved and fully recovered. Plastic Yield is a *permanent* transformation where the system adopts a new, and often degraded, resonant identity.

# Elastic Yield

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A temporary, reversible response to elevated Temporal Pressure (Œì) where a system alters its configuration to manage a high coherence cost (V_Œì) without exceeding its coherence budget (KœÑ). This process occurs within a stable Laminar Flow state. The system's core resonant identity (Ki) is preserved, and it returns to its original state once the external pressure subsides.

## EFT-First Summary
In classical mechanics, Elastic Yield is known as elastic deformation, the property of a material to return to its original shape after an applied stress is removed. This phenomenon is typically modeled by Hooke's Law (F=-kx) where potential energy increases with displacement. The Pirouette Framework generalizes this, modeling it as a system's strategy to manage a rising coherence cost (V_Œì) by temporarily adopting a strained configuration, a direct consequence of minimizing the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) while preserving its coherence budget (KœÑ).
