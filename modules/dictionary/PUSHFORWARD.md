    An internal, complex geometry, rich with symmetries, casts a shadow into our observable spacetime. We perceive this shadow not as geometry, but as the fundamental forces that govern reality. The Σ-pushforward is the act of casting this shadow.
  law: |
    The Σ map transports the connection 1-form \(A_\mu^{(\tau)}\) and curvature 2-form \(F_{\mu\nu}^{(\tau)}\) from the internal τ-space to the observer's spacetime chart, preserving gauge covariance and thus generating a Yang-Mills theory. The components transform as tensors: \(A_\mu^{(obs)}=\Sigma_\mu^{\;\nu}A_\nu^{(\tau)}\).
  philosophy: |
    This mechanism posits that gauge forces are not fundamental entities but are emergent consequences of an observer's perspective on a more primordial, unified geometric object (the Ki field). It replaces the postulate of gauge symmetry with a principle of geometric projection.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Σ-Pushforward is the core process by which the geometric structure of the Ki field's internal symmetry space (\(\mathcal{F}\)) is projected from the time-substrate manifold (\(\mathcal{M}_\tau\)) onto the observer's spacetime manifold (\(\mathcal{M}_{x,t}\)). It maps the internal connection \(A_\mu^{(\tau)}\) and curvature \(F_{\mu\nu}^{(\tau)}\), which describe holonomy in τ-space, into the corresponding observable gauge potential \(A_\mu^{(obs)}\) and field strength tensor \(F_{\mu\nu}^{(obs)}\). This projection is guaranteed to be gauge-covariant, making internal symmetries manifest as a Yang-Mills theory.

        outline: |
          The Σ-Pushforward is not directly measured. Its properties are inferred by: 1. Postulating an internal fiber structure (e.g., \(\mathcal{F}=\mathbb{C}^3\)). 2. Computing the resulting geometric properties, like the fiber metric \(h_{ab}\). 3. Performing the Σ-Pushforward to predict the observable gauge group (e.g., SU(3)) and its coupling constants \(g_N\). 4. Comparing these predictions with high-precision measurements of Standard Model couplings (e.g., \(\alpha_S\)) at various energy scales.

      The spatialization map \(\Sigma:\mathcal{M}_\tau\!\to\!\mathcal{M}_{x,t}\) transports internal parallel transport into the observer’s spacetime chart. Because Σ preserves the Noether currents of MATH-024, gauge covariance survives the pushforward. Thus Yang–Mills structure emerges as the Σ-shadow of internal τ-space holonomy.

      where \(D_\mu=\partial_\mu+A_\mu^{(obs)}\) acts on matter wavefunctions identified with localized Ki-modes. The coupling constants \(g_N\) follow from the normalization of the internal kinetic term.

  disambiguation: |
    Within the Pirouette Framework, Σ denotes the spatialization map, a specific tensor transformation between the τ-substrate and observer spacetime. It is not a summation operator unless explicitly written with indices, e.g., \(\sum_i\). The context of mapping between manifolds (\(\Sigma:\mathcal{M}_\tau\!\to\!\mathcal{M}_{x,t}\)) distinguishes it from other uses.

# Σ-Pushforward

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Σ-Pushforward is the core process by which the geometric structure of the Ki field's internal symmetry space (\(\mathcal{F}\)) is projected from the time-substrate manifold (\(\mathcal{M}_\tau\)) onto the observer's spacetime manifold (\(\mathcal{M}_{x,t}\)). It maps the internal connection \(A_\mu^{(\tau)}\) and curvature \(F_{\mu\nu}^{(\tau)}\), which describe holonomy in τ-space, into the corresponding observable gauge potential \(A_\mu^{(obs)}\) and field strength tensor \(F_{\mu\nu}^{(obs)}\). This projection is guaranteed to be gauge-covariant, making internal symmetries manifest as a Yang-Mills theory.

## EFT-First Summary
The Σ-Pushforward provides a geometric origin for Yang-Mills theory. It maps the connection and curvature from a hidden internal space into observable spacetime, generating the gauge fields (e.g., gluons, W/Z bosons) of the Standard Model. This process recasts gauge forces, coupling constants, and symmetry breaking not as fundamental axioms, but as emergent features of a more primordial geometry, in direct analogy with how general relativity describes gravity as a manifestation of spacetime curvature. The explicit correspondence is detailed in `XAP-006`.
