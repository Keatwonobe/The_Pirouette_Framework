    A choir singing from the same hymn sheet, where each mind is a voice tuned to a shared key. It is the invisible architecture of collective thought, the silent hum of perfect alignment.
  law: |
    The degree of Semantic Coherence in a group is inversely proportional to the time and energy required to resolve a conceptual ambiguity. Perfect coherence (C_s → 1) implies the time to resolve ambiguity approaches zero.
  philosophy: |
    Collective action requires a shared reality. Semantic Coherence is the instrument that forges this reality, transforming a collection of individual perspectives into a unified cognitive field capable of coherent, complex work. It is the precondition for building anything that lasts.

  A state where the core concepts of the framework resonate with the same structural pattern (Ki) across multiple minds, enabling laminar flow in discourse and collaborative action. It is the explicit goal of the Weaver's Lexicon and a prerequisite for maximizing a collective's Temporal Coherence (K_τ).

          1. Select a core framework concept and its Correspondence Protocol.
          2. Present a novel scenario to a group of N subjects.
          3. Each subject independently uses the protocol to generate a 1-sentence application of the concept to the scenario.
          4. Compute the semantic distance (e.g., using cosine distance of sentence embeddings) between all N(N-1)/2 pairs of responses.
          5. Coherence C_s is `1 - (average semantic distance / max possible distance)`.

        pitfalls: [Goodhart's Law (subjects memorize "correct" applications instead of internalizing the pattern), Bias from the chosen semantic distance metric.]

      A framework is not built from principles, but from the shared understanding of those principles. Language is the medium of that understanding...

    excerpt: |
      Misunderstanding and ambiguity are forms of communicative friction that increase the Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) on a collective. The Lexicon minimizes this pressure by providing a shared, stable language, allowing the group to follow its geodesic with the least resistance.

      justification: |
        Semantic Coherence describes a state where multiple independent oscillators (minds) converge on a common frequency and phase (conceptual pattern) due to a coupling force (the Lexicon). This is directly analogous to phase-locking phenomena in networks of coupled oscillators, as described by the Kuramoto model.

    - target: Phase Locking
      rationale: The analogy to phase-locked oscillators provides a robust, mathematically grounded model for how a shared instrument (the Lexicon) can entrain disparate cognitive systems into a coherent, functional whole.

    Distinguish from 'consensus' or 'agreement'. Semantic Coherence is not about agreeing on an opinion, but about using a conceptual tool in the same way to parse reality. Two Weavers can be in perfect coherence while arriving at different conclusions based on their unique perspectives and data.

# Semantic Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A state where the core concepts of the framework resonate with the same structural pattern (Ki) across multiple minds, enabling laminar flow in discourse and collaborative action. It is the explicit goal of the Weaver's Lexicon and a prerequisite for maximizing a collective's Temporal Coherence (K_τ).

## EFT-First Summary
Semantic Coherence is conceptually modeled as **Phase Locking** in a network of coupled oscillators. In this analogy, individual minds are oscillators, and the Weaver's Lexicon acts as the coupling force that entrains them to a shared phase and frequency (i.e., a shared conceptual pattern). This state minimizes communicative friction (Temporal Pressure) and maximizes the system's capacity for coordinated action (Temporal Coherence), analogous to how synchronized systems can perform work more efficiently.
