        Environmental Knot Variation: It is predicted that neutrinos produced in different physical environments (e.g., the core of the Sun, a terrestrial reactor, a supernova) may exist as different knots on the manifold. While their oscillation behavior would be identical, their absolute masses could be subtly different.

  art: |
    The universe is not built from rigid bricks, but woven from a supple fabric. A knot tied in the dense core of a star is pulled tighter and shaped differently than one tied in the vacuum of space, though both are valid expressions of the same underlying thread.
  law: |
    The absolute masses of neutrino eigenstates (m₁, m₂, m₃) are not universal constants but depend on the Γ-matter parameter of their production environment. Measurements of absolute mass observables (e.g., m_β or Σm) from distinct sources (solar, reactor, cosmological) will yield statistically different values, as predicted by the Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law.
  philosophy: |
    This hypothesis challenges the Platonism of physical constants, suggesting properties like mass are not immutable attributes but relational states, co-determined by a particle and its environment. It replaces the notion of a single universal constant with a manifold of valid, context-dependent solutions.
pirouette_definition: |
  The hypothesis that the specific coordinates (μ_ν, p, q) of a neutrino knot on the Prime Resonance Manifold are determined by its production environment. This results in subtle, predictable variations in the absolute neutrino masses for populations of neutrinos generated in different physical conditions (e.g., solar core vs. terrestrial reactor), while preserving the observed oscillation physics. The effect is modeled by the `Γ-matter toggle`.
operational_definition:
  units: eV
  symbol_table:
    - name: Γ
      meaning: Γ-matter toggle. A parameter representing the degree of environmental influence on the neutrino's production geometry.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "[0, 1], where 0 represents vacuum and 1 represents a dense stellar core."
    - name: Δm_i(Γ)
      meaning: The shift in the absolute mass of eigenstate `i` as a function of the environmental parameter Γ.
      dimensions: M (typically eV/c²)

    procedures:
      - name: Differential Absolute Mass Spectrometry
        outline: |
          Perform high-precision measurements of an absolute neutrino mass observable (e.g., m_β from tritium decay endpoint via experiments like KATRIN/Project 8, or Σm from CMB/LSS surveys). Compare results for neutrino populations known to originate from different sources, such as terrestrial reactors (low-Γ) vs. the Sun (high-Γ).
        expected_signals:
          - A non-zero difference between m_β(reactor) and m_β(solar) consistent with predictions. Per DOMA-PHYS-002 tables, the shift is on the order of 0.00907938 - 0.00907895 ≈ 0.4 μeV.
          - A value for Σm from CMB data (primordial, vacuum Γ≈0) differing from one derived from late-universe large-scale structure where neutrinos may have interacted.
        pitfalls:
          - The predicted mass shifts are extremely small (~μeV scale) and likely below the sensitivity of current or near-future experiments.
          - Systemic uncertainties in source modeling and detector calibration could obscure or mimic the signal.

      Environmental Knot Variation: It is predicted that neutrinos produced in different physical environments (e.g., the core of the Sun, a terrestrial reactor, a supernova) may exist as different knots on the manifold. While their oscillation behavior would be identical, their absolute masses could be subtly different. This could potentially be detected by future experiments capable of measuring the absolute neutrino mass with extreme precision.

    excerpt: |
      The discovery of this manifold implies a previously unseen degree of freedom in the universe. It suggests that the laws of physics are not just a set of rigid numbers, but a set of relationships that allow for a certain geometric "suppleness."

    - target: MSW Effect (Matter Effects)
      domain: SM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The MSW effect describes how neutrino propagation (effective mixing angles) is altered by matter density. EKV is a conceptual analog, proposing that a neutrino's intrinsic properties (absolute mass) are determined by the matter density of its *production* environment. Both link neutrino properties to the surrounding medium, but MSW affects propagation dynamics while EKV affects static mass properties set at creation.

  claims:
    - statement: "The absolute mass spectrum (m₁, m₂, m₃) of neutrinos varies measurably with the production environment (e.g., stellar core vs. nuclear reactor)."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "Future high-precision, source-discriminated measurements of absolute neutrino mass (e.g., m_β from solar vs. reactor neutrinos) show no statistically significant difference, ruling out the predicted Γ-dependent variation."

  disambiguation: |
    This effect must be distinguished from the MSW effect. EKV is a hypothesized shift in *absolute mass* determined at the point of *production*. The MSW effect is a confirmed phenomenon affecting *effective mixing angles* during *propagation* through matter.
