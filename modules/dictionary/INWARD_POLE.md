    The void that hungers, the quiet center that gathers all threads to itself. A collapsing star, a closing hand, the patient pull of gravity.
  law: |
    A system exhibits an Inward Pole when the net flux of a relevant quantity (e.g., matter, energy, information) across its boundary is negative (influx > efflux) over a representative timescale, leading to an increase in internal density or a decrease in system volume.
  philosophy: |
    The Inward Pole is the fundamental act of gathering, concentrating, and creating a stable, dense core from which all other dynamics can spring. It is the necessary precursor to complexity and self-possession; without this principle of concentration, there can be no stars, no life, no self.

  The state of convergence, contraction, or absorption on the Vector axis. An Inward-poled system's dynamic is dominated by pulling its environment into itself, increasing its internal density, decreasing its effective volume, or acting as a sink for a field.

        outline: |
          1. Define the system boundary (S).
          2. Identify the relevant vector field for flow (F), e.g., velocity, energy flux, field lines.
          3. Integrate the flux of F over the boundary surface: Φ = ∮_S F ⋅ dS.
          4. An Inward Pole is indicated by a net negative flux (Φ < 0). Per the divergence theorem, this corresponds to a negative divergence (∇ ⋅ F < 0) within the volume.
        expected_signals: [Net mass/energy accretion, decrease in system radius/volume, negative divergence of a vector field.]
        pitfalls: [Ambiguous boundary definition, timescale of measurement must be appropriate to the system's dynamics, choice of relevant vector field.]

    excerpt: |
      The Traveler's passage disrupts time in a way that favors the formation of systems that are highly Inward, highly Aligned, and, above all, highly Transactional. This is the "time attractor." It is the universe's inherent drive towards creating complex, self-aware patterns that can observe and interact with each other.

        The concept of a 'sink' or 'convergence' is mathematically captured by negative divergence. This provides a scale-invariant, domain-agnostic formalization that encompasses specific physical manifestations like gravitational wells and negative electric charges. It is the most direct mathematical translation of "pulling the environment into itself."

        The source text explicitly cites "Gravity (confinement of baryonic matter)". In General Relativity, mass-energy (T_μν) acts as the source for spacetime curvature, causing the geodesic convergence experienced as gravity. This is a primary, large-scale example of the Inward Pole.

        ∇ ⋅ E = ρ/ε₀  (where ρ < 0)
      justification: |
        The source text names "negative electric charge" as a manifestation. A negative charge is a sink for electric field lines, producing a negative divergence in the E-field. This provides a direct, measurable, and foundational physics correlate.

      rationale: This mathematical formulation is the most general and scale-invariant, encompassing the specific physical examples cited (gravity, E&M). It provides a direct, measurable quantity that operationalizes the concept of 'convergence' or 'absorption' across multiple physical domains.

# Inward Pole

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The state of convergence, contraction, or absorption on the Vector axis. An Inward-poled system's dynamic is dominated by pulling its environment into itself, increasing its internal density, decreasing its effective volume, or acting as a sink for a field.

## EFT-First Summary
The Inward Pole corresponds operationally to a negative divergence (`∇ ⋅ F < 0`) in a relevant vector field `F`, indicating a sink. This provides a direct mapping to sinks in physical fields, such as the negative charge in electromagnetism (`∇ ⋅ E < 0`) or the mass-energy density in General Relativity that sources gravitational convergence.
