  art: |
    To intervene is not to command, but to persuade. We offer a system a more beautiful rhythm, a more effortless path, and allow its own nature to guide it home to a state of health.
  law: |
    A system will entrain to an external resonant pattern if and only if that pattern presents a path of greater coherence—a more efficient geodesic in its state space—than its current trajectory.
  philosophy: |
    Coherence Weaving reframes intervention as an act of collaboration with the universe's innate drive toward coherence, not an imposition of external control. It is the practice of focused humility, ensuring that our touch upon the world is one of care, helping a system find a harmony it was already longing to play.
pirouette_definition: |
  The act of introducing a new, stable resonant pattern into an existing system, thereby reshaping its state space to make a desired healthy state the new path of least resistance. It is a precise, minimally invasive action (a Daedalus Gambit) designed to guide a system toward a state of robust, laminar flow by working with its innate drive toward coherence.

        outline: |
          A seven-phase, safety-first protocol for executing a Coherence Weaving act:
          1. **Diagnosis:** Map system flow and identify pathology (e.g., stagnation, turbulence) using the Caduceus Lens.
          2. **Simulation:** Model the proposed intervention's effect on the coherence manifold using the Pirouette Lagrangian.
          3. **Integrity Gate:** Conduct a formal safety review to prevent unintended manifold destabilization.
          4. **The Gambit:** Execute the minimal, precise physical or informational intervention.
          5. **Attunement:** Monitor the system's response in real-time and provide fine-tuning.
          6. **Integration:** Record the intervention and its effects in the Wound Channel Ledger.
          7. **Reversibility:** Maintain a pre-planned protocol to dampen dissonant echoes and return to baseline if necessary.

    excerpt: |
      To command a river, one does not build a dam of infinite strength. One finds the single stone whose placement will persuade the water to carve a new and better path for itself. This module replaces the brute-force engineering mindset with a holistic, time-first philosophy. It codifies the art of **Coherence Weaving**: introducing a new, stable resonant pattern into an existing system.
  - module: DOMA-070
    excerpt: |
      This entire protocol is the practical application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. A system in a turbulent or stagnant state is one that is trapped on an inefficient geodesic. The Daedalus Gambit is an act of metaphysical architecture. It does not force the system to change. Instead, it subtly reshapes the system's state space to make the desired healthy state the new path of least resistance.

        The 'Tuning Fork' gambit acts as an external driving force F(t), introducing a stable frequency to a turbulent (chaotic) system. The system's entrainment to this signal is analogous to a driven oscillator locking onto the driving frequency, settling into a stable, coherent pattern.

        Coherence Weaving modifies a system's potential landscape (related to the V_Γ term in the Pirouette Lagrangian) so the desired healthy state becomes the trajectory that minimizes the action. The Gambit is the nudge that allows the system to discover and settle onto this new, more efficient (coherent) path.

    Distinguish from brute-force engineering or simple control. Coherence Weaving is not about *forcing* a state but *inviting* it by making it the most natural and energetically favorable path for the system to take. The emphasis is on minimal energy and maximal systemic collaboration.

# Coherence Weaving

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The act of introducing a new, stable resonant pattern into an existing system, thereby reshaping its state space to make a desired healthy state the new path of least resistance. It is a precise, minimally invasive action (a Daedalus Gambit) designed to guide a system toward a state of robust, laminar flow by working with its innate drive toward coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Coherence Weaving is analogous to applying a carefully chosen forcing term to a chaotic or unstable oscillator, causing it to entrain to a stable, harmonic state. It can also be viewed through the lens of the Principle of Least Action, where an intervention subtly alters the potential landscape of a system, making the desired coherent state the new "path of least resistance" or minimal action. The goal is to achieve a state transition with minimal energy and disruption by leveraging the system's own dynamics.
