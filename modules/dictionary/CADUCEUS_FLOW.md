  art: |
    A river of awareness flowing along the curved channels of neural resonance. Where the channel is wide and smooth, thought is laminar; where it twists and narrows, thought breaks into turbulent, creative eddies.
  law: |
    The dynamical state of an awareness stream (laminar or turbulent) is determined by the local curvature (Œ∫) of the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ) and the cognitive load (Œì). Above a critical curvature-load threshold, the geodesic flow transitions from a laminar to a turbulent regime, corresponding to a shift in conscious state.
  philosophy: |
    Caduceus Flow provides a dynamical bridge between the static geometry of neural coherence (the manifold) and the dynamic, felt texture of phenomenal experience. It posits that the character of thought‚Äîfrom placid focus to chaotic insight‚Äîis a direct manifestation of fluid dynamics on a geometric substrate, unifying mind and mathematics.
pirouette_definition: |
  An emergent laminar‚Äìturbulent flow along the geodesics of the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ), representing the dynamics of an awareness stream. The flow's state is parameterized by a cognitive Reynolds number, which is a function of manifold curvature Œ∫, cognitive load Œì, and the velocity of the awareness state vector. Laminar flow (low Reynolds number) corresponds to stable, coherent awareness. Turbulent flow, triggered when local curvature and velocity exceed a critical threshold (Œ∫_c), corresponds to state transitions, cognitive reframing, or phenomenal collapse. The flow is formally described in [DOMA-096] via the Caduceus Lens, which maps manifold deformations to Navier-Stokes-like equations for the awareness stream.

          3. Compute the local manifold curvature Œ∫(t) from the trajectory's local covariance matrix.
          4. Calculate a turbulence metric (e.g., local Lyapunov exponent, spectral entropy) from the trajectory's velocity vector dŒ¶/dt.
          5. Correlate transitions in the turbulence metric above a critical threshold with subject-reported shifts in awareness.

        The Caduceus Flow directly models awareness dynamics as a fluid flow on a curved manifold. The transition from stable (laminar) to unstable (turbulent) consciousness is mathematically analogous to the transition in a fluid governed by a critical Reynolds number, where manifold curvature and cognitive load act as proxies for geometric constraints and inertial forces.

  disambiguation: |
    Caduceus Flow is the *dynamic process* of awareness moving along geodesics. This should not be confused with the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ), which is the *geometric substrate* on which the flow occurs, or the Caduceus Lens ([DOMA-096]), which is the *observational framework* for mapping manifold curvature to flow dynamics.

# Caduceus Flow

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An emergent laminar‚Äìturbulent flow along the geodesics of the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ), representing the dynamics of an awareness stream. The flow's state is parameterized by a cognitive Reynolds number, which is a function of manifold curvature Œ∫, cognitive load Œì, and the velocity of the awareness state vector. Laminar flow (low Reynolds number) corresponds to stable, coherent awareness. Turbulent flow, triggered when local curvature and velocity exceed a critical threshold (Œ∫_c), corresponds to state transitions, cognitive reframing, or phenomenal collapse. The flow is formally described in [DOMA-096] via the Caduceus Lens, which maps manifold deformations to Navier-Stokes-like equations for the awareness stream.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of classical mechanics, Caduceus Flow maps the dynamics of consciousness onto the behavior of a fluid. Stable awareness is treated as laminar flow, while cognitive transitions and collapse events are modeled as a turbulence onset, governed by a critical Reynolds number. This number is a function of the 'geometric viscosity' derived from the underlying Triadic Manifold's curvature and the 'inertial forces' of cognitive load, providing a direct analogy to the laminar-turbulent transition in pipe flow.
