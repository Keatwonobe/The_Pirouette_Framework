  art: |
    The steady, unwavering pulse of the cosmos, a universal metronome. Against its rhythm, the chaotic dance of local temporal frames finds its measure and aligns into coherence.
  law: |
    The stiffness of the U(1) Clock, `K_1 ≡ 1/g'²`, is a fundamental modulus of the temporal medium. Its ratio to the SU(2) Triad stiffness (`K_2`) deterministically sets the weak mixing angle at the coherence scale, `sin²θ_W = (K₂/K₁)/(1 + K₂/K₁)`.
  philosophy: |
    To provide a stable, universal temporal reference, grounding the local, degenerate time-frames of the SU(2) Triad. Without this common clock, the notion of 'alignment' (and thus the weak mixing that produces the physical photon) would be undefined.
pirouette_definition: |
  The U(1) Clock is the connection field `B_μ` associated with the hypercharge `U(1)_Y` gauge group, representing the universal, abelian temporal reference frame. Its dynamics are governed by a stiffness modulus `K₁ ≡ 1/g'²`, which quantifies the energetic cost of its curvature. The Higgs field mediates the alignment of the SU(2) Temporal Triad to this clock, a process that fixes the Weinberg angle at the coherence scale `μ_c`.

          The Clock's stiffness `K₁` is not measured directly but is inferred from a global fit to electroweak observables.
          1. Measure `sin²θ_W(M_Z)` and `α_EM(M_Z)` at the Z-pole with high precision.
          2. Use Standard Model Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) to run the corresponding couplings `g'(M_Z)` and `g(M_Z)` *up* to the coherence scale `μ_c`.
          3. Calculate the stiffness at the barrier: `K₁ = 1 / g'(μ_c)²`.
          4. Verify that this calculated `K₁` and the inferred stiffness ratio `ρ_stiff` are consistent with the allowed values in Pirouette's Resonance Atlas (XXP-BRIDGE-Γ-001).

    excerpt: |
      The weak interaction is derived as the connection of a local temporal triad... and the Higgs aligns this triad with the U(1) clock. This establishes a stiffness-ratio formula for the Weinberg angle at the coherence barrier. The Clock connection is the hypercharge field (B_μ) with coupling (g'), and its stiffness is defined as (K_1 ≡ 1/g'²).
  - module: DYNA-WEAK-001
    excerpt: |
      The weak mixing angle at the coherence scale (μ_c) is fixed by the triad-to-clock stiffness ratio `ρ_stiff = K₂/K₁`. This ratio is a direct mechanical property of the temporal medium. The angle `sin²θ_W(μ_c)` is given by `ρ_stiff / (1+ρ_stiff)`, establishing a deterministic link between the medium's properties and a key electroweak parameter.

        The U(1) Clock is an explicit re-interpretation of the Standard Model's U(1) hypercharge gauge field `B_μ`. The Pirouette framework assigns a physical meaning to its coupling `g'` as the inverse square-root of a temporal medium stiffness, `K₁`.

    Distinguish from the U(1)ₑₘ photon field `A_μ`. The U(1) Clock (`B_μ`) is a more fundamental field in this framework. The photon is an emergent field that arises from the specific mixing of the U(1) Clock with the neutral component of the Temporal Triad (`W³_μ`) during Higgs alignment.

# U(1) Clock

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The U(1) Clock is the connection field `B_μ` associated with the hypercharge `U(1)_Y` gauge group, representing the universal, abelian temporal reference frame. Its dynamics are governed by a stiffness modulus `K₁ ≡ 1/g'²`, which quantifies the energetic cost of its curvature. The Higgs field mediates the alignment of the SU(2) Temporal Triad to this clock, a process that fixes the Weinberg angle at the coherence scale `μ_c`.

## EFT-First Summary
In the Standard Model, the U(1) Clock is the `U(1)_Y` hypercharge gauge field, `B_μ`. Its kinetic term is `-1/4 B_{μν} B^{μν}`, and it couples to matter fields via the hypercharge coupling `g'`. This field mixes with the neutral `W³_μ` boson of the SU(2) group to form the physical photon `A_μ` and Z boson `Z_μ`. Pirouette provides a physical interpretation for the coupling `g'` as the inverse square root of a mechanical property of spacetime called temporal 'stiffness'.
