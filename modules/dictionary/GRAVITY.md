        Gravity is the tendency of objects to follow the path of least resistance (a geodesic) through a landscape of changing temporal density. They are not pulled by a force; they are coasting downhill in time.

    Not a pull, but a fall. A silent coasting downhill in the river of time, whose current quickens around the roar of massive objects.
  law: |
    The acceleration of a test particle is proportional to the negative gradient of the local Temporal Density (Γ). Objects follow geodesics in a spacetime metric whose curvature is determined by Γ and its derivatives.
  philosophy: |
    Gravity is not an external force acting upon objects, but an intrinsic consequence of their journey through a richly textured temporal landscape. It reveals that the shape of spacetime is dictated by its "sonic" complexity, transforming a fundamental force into an emergent geometry of resonance.
pirouette_definition: |
  The emergent phenomenon whereby objects with mass-energy follow geodesics through a spacetime whose curvature is determined by the local gradient of Temporal Density (Γ). Massive objects are loci of high temporal complexity, creating a dense Γ-field around them. Other objects are not 'pulled' by a force, but rather follow the path of least resistance through this landscape of varying temporal density.

          Measure the full Temporal Signature T(x) of a distant, stable source (e.g., a cosmic maser or pulsar). Observe how this signature is distorted as its path traverses the Γ-field of a massive intervening object (e.g., a star or galaxy). The degree of frequency-dependent path deflection and temporal decoherence provides a direct measure of the Γ-gradient.

      Gravity as a Gradient in Time: A massive object is a locus of immense temporal complexity—a sustained roar in the song of existence. The intense Γ it generates is the curvature of spacetime. Gravity is the tendency of objects to follow the path of least resistance (a geodesic) through a landscape of changing temporal density. They are not pulled by a force; they are coasting downhill in time.

        Pirouette's Γ-gradient is proposed as the underlying physical mechanism for what General Relativity describes mathematically as spacetime curvature. A massive object's Stress-Energy Tensor (T_μν) corresponds to its high-density Temporal Signature. This signature generates a high local Γ, which in turn manifests as the geometric curvature G_μν.

    Distinguish from the Newtonian concept of gravity as an attractive force between masses. In Pirouette, gravity is an emergent effect of motion through a pre-existing temporal landscape, not a direct interaction between objects. It is a geometry, not a force.

# Gravity

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The emergent phenomenon whereby objects with mass-energy follow geodesics through a spacetime whose curvature is determined by the local gradient of Temporal Density (Γ). Massive objects are loci of high temporal complexity, creating a dense Γ-field around them. Other objects are not 'pulled' by a force, but rather follow the path of least resistance through this landscape of varying temporal density.

## EFT-First Summary
In the Pirouette Framework, Gravity is the phenomenological manifestation of spacetime curvature. This curvature is not a fundamental property, but arises from gradients in the underlying scalar field of Temporal Density (Γ). This provides a physical mechanism for the geometry described by General Relativity, mapping the Stress-Energy Tensor to a source of high temporal complexity (high Γ) and the Einstein Tensor to the resulting geometric distortion.
