  art: |
    At the bottom of every well of meaning lies a final, un-siftable silt. This is the irreducible static of the universe's own making, the hum of the forge from which all patterns emerge. It is the last layer of noise that is itself a final, foundational truth.
  law: |
    The Entropic Floor is the terminal residue manifold, $M_{final}$, generated by the Archaeologist's Sieve, whose Temporal Coherence falls below a predefined critical threshold ($K_\tau(M_{final}) < K_{\tau\_min}$). Further decomposition of this manifold yields no stable, coherent resonances.
  philosophy: |
    The Entropic Floor establishes the conceptual boundary between signal and fundamental chaos. It is the operational limit of coherence-based analysis, representing the system's intrinsic, incompressible complexity. Acknowledging this floor is to acknowledge that not all noise is unexcavated signal; some is the very texture of reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Entropic Floor is the final Echo Manifold ($M_k$) produced by the iterative coherence extraction process defined in The Archaeologist's Sieve (DOMA-176). It is the state reached when the manifold's Temporal Coherence ($K_\tau$) drops below a system-dependent Coherence Threshold ($K_{\tau\_min}$), signifying that no further dominant resonances can be meaningfully extracted. This manifold represents the irreducible, chaotic noise profile of the system, understood as a direct expression of the underlying Temporal Forge.
operational_definition:
  units: The units of the manifold's components are inherited from the Primary Manifold ($M_0$). The defining property, Temporal Coherence ($K_\tau$), is dimensionless.
  symbol_table:
    - name: $M_{floor}$
      meaning: The Entropic Floor; the final residue manifold.
      dimensions: Context-dependent (matches Primary Manifold).
      default_range: N/A
    - name: $K_{\tau\_min}$
      meaning: Coherence Threshold; the minimum temporal coherence required for a manifold to be considered signal.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: 0.05 – 0.2

      - name: Archaeologist's Sieve Termination
        outline: |
          1. Apply the Archaeologist's Sieve protocol (DOMA-176) to a system's Primary Manifold ($M_0$).
          2. At each iteration $k$, extract the dominant resonance $Ki_k$ and compute the subsequent Echo Manifold, $M_k = M_{k-1} - f(Ki_k)$.
          3. Measure the Temporal Coherence $K_\tau(M_k)$.
          4. The process terminates when $K_\tau(M_k) < K_{\tau\_min}$. The resulting manifold, $M_k$, is the Entropic Floor.
        expected_signals: [A measured value of $K_\tau$ that falls below the threshold, A terminal noise manifold with a stable, low-coherence power spectrum.]
        pitfalls: [Setting $K_{\tau\_min}$ too high, prematurely terminating the analysis and classifying structured echoes as noise (Type II error)., Setting $K_{\tau\_min}$ too low, causing the analysis to overfit and extract spurious patterns from random fluctuations (Type I error).]

      The loop ends. The final $M_{current}$ is the system's **Entropic Floor**. The complete output is a layered model of the system, comprising the sequence of identified resonances ($Ki_1, Ki_2, ...$) and the final noise profile of the Entropic Floor. This is the system's **Harmonic Spectrum**.

      justification: |
        Thermal noise represents a fundamental, irreducible noise floor in an electronic system dependent on its temperature (a measure of chaotic energy). The Entropic Floor is conceptually analogous, representing an irreducible noise floor in a coherence manifold dependent on the system's proximity to the chaotic Temporal Forge. $K_{\tau\_min}$ acts as a proxy for the signal-to-noise ratio limit.

        A Kolmogorov-random string is algorithmically incompressible; no description is shorter than the string itself. The Entropic Floor is the data manifold that is information-incompressible via the Archaeologist's Sieve; no further resonant patterns (compressive descriptions) can be extracted.

  disambiguation: |
    The term "noise floor" in engineering typically refers to the sensitivity limit of a measurement instrument. The Entropic Floor is distinct: it is a theoretical, intrinsic property of the observed system, representing fundamental, incompressible chaotic dynamics, which may or may not be measurable by a given instrument.
