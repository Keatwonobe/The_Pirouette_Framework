  art: |
    The loom that weaves the future thread by thread from the landscape of the present. It calculates the river's inevitable path, not merely where the water is now. It reveals the dance a system was always meant to perform.
  law: |
    The Lagrangian Solver computes a system's state trajectory `x(t)` by numerically integrating the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian `L_p`. The resulting path is the geodesic that maximizes the coherence action `S_p`.
  philosophy: |
    The Solver embodies the principle of predictive choreography. It confirms that intervention is not about force but about insight—shaping conditions so that the system *chooses* its own most graceful path to a healthier state, making elegance computable.
pirouette_definition: |
  The core computational engine within the Crucible of Coherence responsible for evolving a system's state over time. It calculates the system's geodesic path by numerically integrating the equations of motion derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), thereby finding the trajectory of maximal coherence under specified initial conditions and interventions.

        outline: |
          1. Define a system in the Crucible with initial state `x(t₀)`.
          2. Run the Lagrangian Solver for a duration `Δt` with no interventions to produce a trajectory `x(t)`.
          3. Introduce a small, known perturbation `δx(t)` to the path, keeping endpoints fixed.
          4. Calculate the coherence action `S_p` for both the original and perturbed paths.
          The Solver is verified if `S_p(x(t)) > S_p(x(t) + δx(t))`, confirming the original path is a local maximum.

    excerpt: |
      The core of the Crucible is its physics engine, which models how a system's path evolves in response to change. It does not guess; it calculates the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—for the system under the influence of the proposed interventions. The **Lagrangian Solver** integrates the system's state according to the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**.
  - module: DOMA-121
    excerpt: |
      The core of the engine is the optimization of the action integral: S_p = ∫ L_p dt. The "best" intervention is the one that alters the coherence manifold such that the system, in following its new geodesic, achieves the highest possible value for S_p. The simulator is a search engine for interventions that maximize a system's potential for coherent, elegant action.

        The Lagrangian Solver operationally executes the task of solving the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion derived from a Lagrangian. The description of GPU acceleration and its role in an optimization loop is standard practice for modern physics simulations aiming to find classical paths that extremize an action.

    While the term is generic, within the Pirouette Framework it *specifically* refers to the engine that integrates the Pirouette Lagrangian (`L_p`), which quantifies system coherence, not necessarily a classical mechanical Lagrangian based on kinetic and potential energy (T-V).

# Lagrangian Solver

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The core computational engine within the Crucible of Coherence responsible for evolving a system's state over time. It calculates the system's geodesic path by numerically integrating the equations of motion derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), thereby finding the trajectory of maximal coherence under specified initial conditions and interventions.

## EFT-First Summary
The Lagrangian Solver is a numerical integrator, typically a GPU-accelerated symplectic or Runge-Kutta method, that solves the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion derived from the system's effective action (the Pirouette Lagrangian). Its function is to compute the classical path, or geodesic, that extremizes this action, providing a predictive trajectory for the system's evolution under specified conditions and interventions. For references on numerical integration methods, see Landau et al., *Computational Physics*.
