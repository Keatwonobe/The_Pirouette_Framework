  law: |
    A system exhibits false radiance when its coherence (low internal entropy) is maintained by actively suppressing novelty, resulting in a positive gradient of systemic fragility over time. It is coherence that increases its own brittleness.
  philosophy: |
    False radiance challenges the simplistic equation of order with "good." It forces a distinction between coherence that enables growth and coherence that calcifies power, making it a critical concept for navigating phase transitions without becoming a tyrant.

          1. Characterize the baseline coherence and regulatory activity of the target system.
          2. Introduce a small, controlled entropic perturbation (e.g., a novel idea, a resource fluctuation, an external agent).
          3. Measure the system's response, specifically the magnitude of the counter-reaction and the change in systemic fragility. A system high in false radiance will react with disproportionate force to suppress the probe or exhibit a cascade failure, rather than absorbing or adapting to it.

        An overfit model exhibits high coherence with its training data (low "error") but is brittle and fails to generalize to new inputs. Similarly, a system with false radiance is highly ordered internally but fragile against external novelty, having optimized for stasis over adaptability. Both mistake performance in a closed context for resilience in an open one.

  disambiguation: |
    False radiance must be distinguished from low Radiance. It is not the *absence* of order, but a *pathological type* of order. A system with high false radiance can appear very stable, clear, and coherent from a static or internal perspective. It is an active, suppressive state, not a passive, disordered one.

# False radiance

## Canonical (Pirouette)
False radiance is a state of high local coherence that is brittle, repressive, and serves primarily to maintain an existing power structure or configuration. It actively prevents the emergence of new, more adaptive forms of order by suppressing dissent, novelty, and entropic probes, mistaking stasis for stability. It is the shadow of true Radiance, appearing ordered and clear but lacking the capacity for growth and adaptation.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, false radiance maps to the phenomenon of overfitting in statistical models. A system with high false radiance is analogous to a model that has minimized its error on a fixed "training set" of conditions to such a degree that it has lost all ability to generalize. It exhibits high coherence with its internal state but is extremely brittle and fragile when presented with novel inputs or environmental changes, leading to catastrophic failure rather than graceful degradation.
