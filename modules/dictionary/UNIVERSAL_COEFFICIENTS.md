  art: |
    These coefficients are the anatomy of an echo, the fixed harmonics of spacetime's resonance with a particle. They form the pure, universal skeleton of self-interaction, a mathematical constant of nature's dialogue with itself, before the particularities of a given lepton add their voice.
  law: |
    The Universal Coefficients, C_n, are dimensionless constants in the power series expansion of the lepton anomalous magnetic moment that are strictly independent of lepton flavor (e, μ, τ) and all non-universal interaction parameters (e.g., Pressuron couplings). Their values are determined either by first-principles calculation within Pirouette or by a global fit to experimental data.
  philosophy: |
    To isolate and test new physics, one must first perfectly characterize the old. The C_n serve as a formal scaffold, cleanly separating the universal, QED-like background from flavor-dependent, model-specific deviations. This methodological separation allows for stable, falsifiable fits where discrepancies cannot be absorbed into arbitrary redefinitions of the core theory.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Universal Coefficients, denoted `C_n`, are the symbolic, lepton-flavor-independent numerical coefficients of the power series expansion of the "Universal Piece" (`a_l^uni`) of a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment. This expansion is expressed in powers of `α/π`. The `C_n` are treated as inputs to the g-2 model, either as placeholders for first-principles calculations or as parameters to be inferred from experimental data. By definition, they do not contain any dependence on lepton mass (beyond standard loop-level mass insertions in known subgraphs) or on parameters from other interaction portals, such as the Pressuron coupling `κ`.

        outline: |
          1. Construct the full theoretical model for the anomalous magnetic moment `a_l`, including the universal series `Σ C_n (α/π)^n` and any new physics terms (e.g., the Pressuron contribution `Δa_l`).
          2. Treat the `C_n` (up to a chosen truncation order N) and new physics parameters as free parameters in a fit.
          3. Perform a simultaneous fit to the high-precision experimental measurements of `a_e` and `a_mu`.
          4. The best-fit values for the `C_n` are their inferred measurements. Their uncertainties are determined by the quality of the fit and the uncertainties of the experimental inputs.
        expected_signals:
          - Stable, well-constrained values for C₁, C₂, etc., that are consistent between fits using electron data, muon data, or both.
          - Values that are numerically close to their counterparts calculated in Standard Model QED.
        pitfalls:
          - Over-fitting: Trying to determine too many `C_n` from limited data, leading to large uncertainties and correlations.
          - Model-dependence: If the new-physics model is incorrect, the fit may pull the `C_n` to non-physical values to compensate.

  disambiguation: |
    Within the Pirouette Framework, `C_n` refers specifically to the coefficients of the `(α/π)` power series for the *universal piece* of the anomalous magnetic moment. They are, by definition, separate from any non-universal or new-physics contributions. Until proven otherwise, they should be considered analogues, not identities, of the Standard Model QED coefficients.

# Universal Coefficients

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Universal Coefficients, denoted `C_n`, are the symbolic, lepton-flavor-independent numerical coefficients of the power series expansion of the "Universal Piece" (`a_l^uni`) of a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment. This expansion is expressed in powers of `α/π`. The `C_n` are treated as inputs to the g-2 model, either as placeholders for first-principles calculations or as parameters to be inferred from experimental data. By definition, they do not contain any dependence on lepton mass (beyond standard loop-level mass insertions in known subgraphs) or on parameters from other interaction portals, such as the Pressuron coupling `κ`.

## EFT-First Summary
The Universal Coefficients `C_n` are the Pirouette Framework's direct analogues to the well-known coefficients of the perturbative QED calculation for the lepton anomalous magnetic moment (`g-2`). In the Standard Model, `a_l = Σ C_n^{QED} (α/π)^n`, where `C_1^{QED} = 0.5` is the famous Schwinger result. Pirouette separates its g-2 prediction into a "Universal Piece" with these symbolic `C_n` coefficients and other model-dependent terms. This allows the framework's universal, QED-like structure to be benchmarked directly against the established QED results, while isolating new physics in separate, additive terms.
