        Healing Coefficient (Hₖ): Ratio of coherent return amplitude to input perturbation.
        ...
        Hₖ = |A_return / A_input| * cos(∆φ)
        Healthy systems have Hₖ ≈ 1. Pathological systems have low coherence or destructive phase lag (∆φ ≈ π).

  art: |
    The measure of a system's resonance; a healthy system rings true when struck, returning an observer's query with clarity and in time. It is the echo that confirms the integrity of the bell, not just its presence.
  law: |
    The Healing Coefficient (Hₖ) is a dimensionless quantity where a value approaching +1 indicates a system that integrates a diagnostic perturbation with minimal amplitude loss and near-zero phase lag. Values approaching zero or becoming negative indicate pathological damping, decoherence, or destructive interference.
  philosophy: |
    This metric operationalizes health not as a static state, but as a dynamic capacity for response and integration. It asserts that to be healthy is to be able to listen to and coherently answer the universe's questions, turning observation from a potential disruption into a source of systemic reinforcement.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dimensionless metric quantifying a system's ability to coherently integrate a diagnostic perturbation. It is calculated as the ratio of the coherent response amplitude to the input perturbation amplitude, modulated by the cosine of the phase difference between the input and response signals. An ideal, healthy system exhibits Hₖ ≈ 1, signifying an in-phase, proportional response, while pathological systems show low or negative values due to signal damping or destructive phase lag.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline measurement of the system's resting coherence (Ki flux).
          2. Inject a controlled, well-defined perturbation (a "diagnostic vibration") with known amplitude `A_input` and phase.
          3. Isolate and measure the amplitude `A_return` and phase of the system's primary coherent response, filtering out noise and secondary echoes.
          4. Calculate the phase difference `∆φ` between the input and return signals.
          5. Compute Hₖ using the formula: `Hₖ = |A_return / A_input| * cos(∆φ)`.

    excerpt: |
      The Lens must measure how observation alters the observed system. When applied, it injects a controlled perturbation (a diagnostic vibration) and observes the return wave. This enables measurement of the Healing Coefficient (Hₖ): the ratio of coherent return amplitude to input perturbation. Healthy systems have Hₖ ≈ 1. Pathological systems have low coherence or destructive phase lag (∆φ ≈ π).
  - module: DYNA-003
    excerpt: |
      The Caduceus Lens becomes the diagnostic bridge—the operator that measures the health of coherence across all layers. The Reflex Arc maps to a re-heating cycle in fusion, and the Healing Coefficient Hₖ maps to productive synthesis in a debate, or an energy gain Q>1 in a fusion reaction.

  candidates:
    - target: Real part of a system's transfer function, Re[G(iω)]
      domain: CM|Math
      mapping_kind: mathematical
      equation_hint: |
        G(iω) = |G|e^(iφ)  =>  Re[G(iω)] = |G|cos(φ)
        Hₖ  = |A_return/A_input|cos(∆φ)
      justification: |
        In control theory, a transfer function G(s) describes a system's output-to-input ratio. For a sinusoidal input, its magnitude |G(iω)| is the amplitude gain and its angle ∠G(iω) is the phase shift. Hₖ is precisely the real part of this function, representing the in-phase component of the system's response.

        Q = P_fusion / P_input
      justification: |
        Q is the ratio of fusion power produced to external power injected to heat the plasma. A Q>1 signifies net energy gain. Hₖ≈1 conceptually maps to this breakeven point, where the system's coherent response "power" equals the diagnostic "power" injected, indicating a self-sustaining coherence.

    - statement: "A system with a consistently high Healing Coefficient (Hₖ ≈ 1) across multiple perturbation frequencies will demonstrate resilience to external shocks and efficiently metabolize new information."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Discovering a system that measures Hₖ ≈ 1 but is brittle, fails to adapt to novel stressors, or exhibits pathological cascades under operational load. This would indicate Hₖ is a measure of rigidity, not health."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from simple response amplitude or "gain." The `cos(∆φ)` term is critical, penalizing out-of-phase or "allergic" responses which indicate systemic friction or dissonance. A system that overreacts with a large amplitude but in a destructive, opposing phase (∆φ ≈ π) would have a negative Hₖ, correctly identifying it as pathological.
