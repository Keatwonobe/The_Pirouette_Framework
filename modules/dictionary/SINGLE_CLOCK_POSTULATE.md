    Every fundamental particle, be it electron or muon, hears the tick of the same cosmic clock. Their charge is the measure of how tightly their own inner rhythm is tethered to this universal beat. All matter dances to one conductor's baton.
  law: |
    All distinct fermion species (f) couple to the emergent U(1) gauge field A_μ via the same clock-synchronization charge unit (q) and the same clock phase field (θ). Consequently, any species-dependence in the observed electric charge (e_f) must arise solely from renormalization group running, not from a bare, species-dependent coupling.
  philosophy: |
    This postulate grounds the observed universality and quantization of electric charge not in an abstract symmetry group, but in a physical mechanism: the shared coupling of all matter defects (fermions) to a single, underlying temporal medium (the clock field θ). It transforms a brute fact of the Standard Model into an emergent consequence of unified dynamics.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Single-Clock Postulate is the principle that all fermion species, represented as Ki defects, couple to the universal clock phase field (θ) with the same fundamental clock-synchronization charge unit (q). This ensures that the physical electric charge, formed from the product of the clock-synchronization charge and the connection stiffness (`e = qg`), is universal for all fundamental particles prior to renormalization effects. Any finite renormalization `Z_θ` from integrating out the clock field is also universal, preserving the relative charge equality between species.

          Perform high-precision measurements of the electric charge of different elementary particles (e.g., electron, muon) at the same energy scale (μ) through processes like particle scattering or bound-state spectroscopy. The postulate predicts that, after accounting for all Standard Model radiative corrections, the fundamental charge units are identical. A confirmed deviation would falsify the postulate.

    excerpt: |
      The (\theta) sector fixes the unit of charge via Berry-phase quantization around the Ki loop (MATH-QED-003). Small-amplitude expansion of the clock kinetic term yields the Noether current `J^\mu_\theta = \kappa (\partial^\mu\theta - q A^\mu)`, so matching to the electromagnetic source requires the same (q) for all spinor Ki defects (single-clock postulate). Any finite renormalization from integrating out (\theta) can be absorbed into a redefinition `q \to Z_\theta^{1/2}q`, which is universal (independent of species).

        The Standard Model postulates U(1)_Y gauge invariance, which leads to a universal coupling constant `g'` for all fields with the same hypercharge.

# Single-Clock Postulate

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Single-Clock Postulate is the principle that all fermion species, represented as Ki defects, couple to the universal clock phase field (θ) with the same fundamental clock-synchronization charge unit (q). This ensures that the physical electric charge, formed from the product of the clock-synchronization charge and the connection stiffness (`e = qg`), is universal for all fundamental particles prior to renormalization effects. Any finite renormalization `Z_θ` from integrating out the clock field is also universal, preserving the relative charge equality between species.

## EFT-First Summary
The Single-Clock Postulate provides an emergent mechanism for the charge universality observed in the Standard Model. In conventional QED, all fundamental particles with charge `Q=-1` (like the electron and muon) couple to the photon with the same strength `e`. Pirouette explains this by positing that all matter particles are defects in a single, shared temporal medium. Their coupling to the emergent electromagnetic field is therefore dictated by a universal property of this medium, guaranteeing that their bare charges are identical before any particle-specific quantum corrections are considered.
