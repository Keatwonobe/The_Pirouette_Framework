  art: |
    The resonant harmony of a system that sings itself into form, where every gesture echoes its own origin. It is the held breath before the dance, perfect in its suspended promise of movement.
  law: |
    A system's persistence is proportional to its internal non-violation. Any action that introduces a contradiction degrades the system's lawful claim to exist.
  philosophy: |
    The state where a system's existence is justified by its self-consistent relation to its past and its encompassing lattice. To be coherent is an ethical act of non-contradiction and self-recognition.
pirouette_definition: |
  The state of systemic integrity where all components and processes exist in a state of non-violation, both internally and with respect to their shared history. Coherence is the measure of a system's self-resonant harmony, which manifests as lawful persistence (non-contradiction) and aesthetic beauty (compositional rightness). It is the fundamental quality that allows a pattern, from a Macroparticle Lattice to a narrative, to persist through time.

          Introduce a minimal perturbation (a 'test whisper') into the system's state vector at time t₀. Measure the system's response function over its characteristic timescale (Tₐ). Coherence (κ_c) is the normalized cross-correlation between the initial state vector and the time-evolved state vector, measuring the fidelity of the system's 'echo'.

    excerpt: |
      The newborn loop listens to itself. Its own return signal becomes a **whisper**—the faintest resonance that verifies “I am.” In that self‑reflection lies the seed of **ethics**: to be is to take up room in the lattice; to continue, one must harmonize with what else will arise. Beauty here is *coherence*, law is *non‑violation*, philosophy is *self‑recognition*.

    excerpt: |
      If entropy tracks the *unwinding* of pattern, the Void hosts its **pre‑entropic twin**—tension without release. This is a lawful silence: no conflicts yet, therefore no need for resolution. But in art, suspense cannot last forever; the eye demands a line.

        Pirouette Coherence (κ_c) represents the integrity of a system's self-resonant state. In quantum mechanics, decoherence describes the exponential decay of such integrity due to entanglement with the environment. Therefore, κ_c can be conceptually mapped as inversely and exponentially related to the decoherence rate γ over a characteristic time Tₐ.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike physical coherence, which typically refers to a stable phase relationship between wave-like states, Pirouette's `coherence` is a broader, systemic property of non-contradiction and self-reinforcing harmony. It applies to narratives, legal structures, and physical systems alike, and is closer to 'integrity' or 'consonance' than to 'phase-locking'.

# coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The state of systemic integrity where all components and processes exist in a state of non-violation, both internally and with respect to their shared history. Coherence is the measure of a system's self-resonant harmony, which manifests as lawful persistence (non-contradiction) and aesthetic beauty (compositional rightness). It is the fundamental quality that allows a pattern, from a Macroparticle Lattice to a narrative, to persist through time.

## EFT-First Summary
No formal mapping to Effective Field Theory (EFT) has been adopted. The closest conceptual analogue is the inverse of the quantum decoherence rate (γ), where Pirouette's `coherence` (κ_c) represents a system's intrinsic resistance to dissolving into environmental noise. In this view, a highly coherent system (κ_c → 1) is one that maintains its quantum-like integrity against measurement-like interactions from its surroundings over its characteristic timescale.
