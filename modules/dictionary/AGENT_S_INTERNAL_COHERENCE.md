  art: |
    The poise of a dancer, the clarity of a tuning fork. It is the agent's internal capacity to hold a complex rhythm without faltering, to play its own song perfectly against the cosmic current.
  law: |
    A state of laminar flow (temporal resonance) is sustainable if and only if the environmental challenge (ΔΓ_env) does not exceed the agent's internal coherence (Kτ_agent). When ΔΓ_env > Kτ_agent, desynchronization is inevitable and the system collapses into turbulence.
  philosophy: |
    This term reframes 'skill' not as an abstract psychological trait, but as a concrete, measurable physical capacity for temporal information processing. It represents the agent's potential to contribute a clear, coherent note to the universe's song, defining the upper bound of its grace and effectiveness.
pirouette_definition: |
  An agent's internal coherence, Kτ_agent, is a measure of its maximum stable rate of temporal information processing. It quantifies the agent's capacity to maintain internal phase-lock and execute complex actions without succumbing to temporal desynchronization (Δτ) under environmental temporal pressure (ΔΓ_env). It is the agent-specific upper bound on the kinetic term (K_τ) in the Pirouette Lagrangian and serves as the direct physical analog to the psychological concept of 'skill'.

        outline: |
          1. Place the agent in a controlled environment with a stable, measurable geodesic (a task with a clear rhythm).
          2. Systematically increase the environmental challenge (ΔΓ_env) by increasing the rate or complexity of the task.
          3. Continuously monitor the agent's temporal desynchronization (Δτ) relative to the task geodesic and its coherence flux (Φ_K).
          4. Kτ_agent is defined as the value of ΔΓ_env at which |Δτ| exceeds a critical threshold (e.g., phase slip occurs) or Φ_K degrades by a set percentage (e.g., '>>10%') from its peak.
        expected_signals: [Δτ (phase error), Φ_K (coherence flux), ΔΓ_env (input signal)]
        pitfalls: [Agent adaptation during the test, confounding non-temporal stressors (e.g., energy depletion), difficulty isolating a pure temporal challenge.]

    excerpt: |
      The celebrated “challenge-skill” balance of psychological Flow theory is the macroscopic experience of this temporal equilibrium. It is the perfect match between the demands of the environment and the capacity of the agent. We can now quantify this dynamic: **Skill** is **Kτ_agent**, the agent's internal coherence; its maximum capacity for processing temporal information without error. **Flow** is the state of **Resonance** where **ΔΓ_env ≈ Kτ_agent**.
  - module: DOMA-010
    excerpt: |
      In the Laminar State (Flow), the system has found the geodesic—the path of maximal action. By attuning its rhythm, it minimizes the experienced `V_Γ`, allowing its `K_τ` to be expressed almost perfectly. The subjective feeling of "effortlessness" is the direct experience of a system that has solved its own Euler-Lagrange equation in real-time. Kτ_agent represents the upper limit of this expressive capacity.

      justification: |
        Kτ_agent represents the maximum rate at which an agent can process "temporal information" (signal) from the environment (ΔΓ_env) without error (desynchronization). This is conceptually identical to Shannon's channel capacity, which defines the maximum rate of error-free information transmission over a noisy channel. The agent's internal processes represent the channel, and decoherence represents the noise.

  claims:
    - statement: "An agent's Kτ_agent is an intrinsic, scalar property, constant over short timescales and across different task domains."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If Kτ_agent is shown to vary significantly with the *type* of task (e.g., cognitive vs. motor) even when ΔΓ_env is held constant, it would suggest Kτ_agent is not a single intrinsic value but a state-dependent vector or tensor."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the instantaneous kinetic term `K_τ` in the Pirouette Lagrangian. `Kτ_agent` is the agent's *maximum capacity* or upper bound for this term, while `K_τ` is its expressed value at a given moment. It is always true that `K_τ ≤ Kτ_agent`.
