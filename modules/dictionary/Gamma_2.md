        - Gravitational well: gradients in Γ act as effective curvature (CORE-004/008).

  art: |
    Time is not a flat river but a landscape with its own hills and valleys. Γ is the elevation of this landscape, whose unseen slopes guide all motion, a silent gravity of pure duration.
  law: |
    The effective gravitational acceleration experienced by a process is proportional to the local gradient of Γ under the chosen spatialization map Σ. In the weak-field limit, **a**_eff = -c²∇_Σ Γ.
  philosophy: |
    Γ operationalizes the Time-First Principle by providing the substrate's intrinsic 'texture.' It replaces the geometric stage of spacetime with a dynamic scalar field in time, asserting that what we perceive as gravity is not the bending of space, but the flow of events down the gradients of a more fundamental temporal landscape.

  Γ is a fundamental scalar field defined on the time-first substrate. Its gradients, when projected into a spatialized chart via the Correspondence Gauge (Σ), manifest as an effective spacetime curvature, recovering the phenomenology of General Relativity in the appropriate limit. Γ is a primary term in the time-first action, S_time, alongside the coherence field Ki.

          1. Observe the gravitational lensing of a distant light source by a massive object (e.g., a galaxy cluster).

          3. Invert the Correspondence Gauge mapping (e.g., `g_00 ≈ 1 + 2Γ` in the weak-field limit) to infer the spatial distribution of the underlying Γ field that would produce the observed effective curvature.

        pitfalls: [The inversion from `g_{μν}` to Γ may not be unique without further constraints, The Correspondence Gauge (Σ) itself may be state-dependent, complicating the inversion.]

      The dictionary mapping is minimal and direct. For gravity, the core statement is that a gravitational well is not fundamental curvature, but a gradient in the Γ field. Gradients in Γ act as effective curvature.

      justification: |
        In the weak-field limit of General Relativity, the metric component `g_{00}` is directly related to the Newtonian gravitational potential Φ. The Pirouette framework posits that Γ generates this effective potential under the Correspondence Gauge. This provides a direct, falsifiable bridge between the time-first substrate and classical gravitational phenomenology.

# Γ

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Γ is a fundamental scalar field defined on the time-first substrate. Its gradients, when projected into a spatialized chart via the Correspondence Gauge (Σ), manifest as an effective spacetime curvature, recovering the phenomenology of General Relativity in the appropriate limit. Γ is a primary term in the time-first action, S_time, alongside the coherence field Ki.

## EFT-First Summary
In the effective field theory (EFT) limit, Γ serves as the fundamental scalar pre-potential for gravity. Under the Standard Model Correspondence Gauge (SM-CG), it is operationally identified with the normalized Newtonian gravitational potential (Φ/c²) in the weak-field, static limit. Its gradients and time-derivatives generate the components of the effective spacetime metric `g_{μν}`, thus recovering the full phenomenology of General Relativity without positing a fundamental geometric spacetime.
