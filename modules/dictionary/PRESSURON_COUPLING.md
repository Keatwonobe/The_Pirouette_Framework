  art: |
    The whisper of temporal pressure deforms the stage of matter. It is the bridge where the abstract flow of coherence touches the concrete, leaving its imprint on mass and energy.
  law: |
    The coupling `g_P` between Temporal Pressure (Γ) and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor (`T^μ_μ`) is a fixed, dimensionless constant determined by the action's variational principle, not an empirically fitted parameter. All matter fields with non-zero `T^μ_μ` must interact with Γ via this leading-order term.
  philosophy: |
    The Pressuron Coupling operationalizes the principle that spacetime's dynamical texture (Γ) is not a passive backdrop but an active participant in physical law. It provides the primary, universal mechanism by which the coherence manifold influences matter, ensuring that Pirouette's predictions are not ad-hoc but emerge from a unified interaction structure.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Pressuron Coupling is the set of allowed interaction terms in the Pirouette Lagrangian density `ℒ_p` that link the Temporal Pressure scalar field (Γ) to matter fields. The leading and most constrained term is the scalar-trace coupling `ℒ_int = g_P Γ T^μ_μ`, where `T^μ_μ` is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of all coupled matter and gauge fields. The coupling constant `g_P` is a dimensionless value fixed by the theory's variational stability constraints (see MATH-018 D2) and is not a free parameter. Higher-order derivative couplings, such as `Γ ∂·J`, are permitted but must also satisfy the D2 constraints of being local, analytic, and scale-covariant.

        outline: |
          The value of `g_P` is not measured directly but is inferred from its systemic effects on Standard Model observables. By calculating the one-loop (or non-perturbative) corrections induced by the `g_P Γ T^μ_μ` term to quantities like anomalous magnetic moments (`a_e`, `a_μ`) and the running of `α`, a global fit is performed against experimental data. The value of `g_P` is that which best explains the deviations from SM-only predictions across this landscape of observables, subject to the D3 anchoring constraint.

    excerpt: |
      The primary interaction between the coherence sector and matter is the Pressuron Coupling. This is dominated by the term `g_P Γ T^μ_μ`, where `T^μ_μ` is the trace of the matter energy-momentum tensor. The coupling `g_P` is uniquely fixed by variational constraints from MATH-018 and is not a free parameter to be fitted to a single experiment.
  - module: PHEN-007
    excerpt: |
      All calculations of Pirouette corrections to Standard Model observables begin with the Pressuron Coupling. For the muon `g-2`, the `Γ` field couples to the trace anomaly `T^μ_μ` in the QCD sector and to the electron/photon loops. The value of `g_P` dictates the overall strength of this new contribution, which is then modulated by the topological index `T` of the local spacetime region.
  - module: COSMO-004
    excerpt: |
      During inflation, the coupling `g_P Γ T^μ_μ` can have significant consequences. The inflaton's energy-momentum trace sources the temporal pressure field `Γ`, leading to a modified potential and a feedback loop that can alter the spectrum of primordial fluctuations. This provides a testable prediction for CMB anisotropies that is directly proportional to `g_P`.

        In scalar-tensor theories, a scalar field couples universally to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor (via the Ricci scalar `R`). The Pressuron Coupling `g_P Γ T^μ_μ` is a direct, non-gravitational analogue where `Γ` couples to the trace of the matter Lagrangian, modifying its dynamics.

    Distinguish the 'Pressuron Coupling' (`g_P`), which is a constant, from the interaction term itself (`g_P Γ T^μ_μ`). The term also differs from 'Gladiator Feedback', which refers to the self-interaction of the `Γ` field, not its coupling to matter.

# Pressuron Coupling

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Pressuron Coupling is the set of allowed interaction terms in the Pirouette Lagrangian density `ℒ_p` that link the Temporal Pressure scalar field (Γ) to matter fields. The leading and most constrained term is the scalar-trace coupling `ℒ_int = g_P Γ T^μ_μ`, where `T^μ_μ` is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of all coupled matter and gauge fields. The coupling constant `g_P` is a dimensionless value fixed by the theory's variational stability constraints (see MATH-018 D2) and is not a free parameter. Higher-order derivative couplings, such as `Γ ∂·J`, are permitted but must also satisfy the D2 constraints of being local, analytic, and scale-covariant.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pressuron Coupling is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to a scalar field interaction in an effective field theory, specifically a scalar (Γ) that couples universally to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor (`T^μ_μ`) of all matter. This structure is common in scalar-tensor theories of gravity and dilatonic models [Brans & Dicke, 1961]. Its fixed, non-tunable coupling constant `g_P` predicts correlated shifts in precision observables, providing a sharp test against the Standard Model.
