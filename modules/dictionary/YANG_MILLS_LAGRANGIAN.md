  art: |
    Maxwell's law came from one clock. Yang–Mills comes from many clocks that must agree at once—a moving scaffold of temporal frames whose curvature is the force itself. Rotate the scaffold in two directions out of order and you create a field: the non-Abelian memory of how time’s basis failed to commute.
  law: |
    The energy density required to sustain a non-Abelian gauge field is proportional to the invariant square of its field-strength tensor, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm YM} = -\tfrac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}^a F^{a,\mu\nu}$. This includes self-interaction terms quadratic in the gauge potential, which arise from the curvature of the internal frame bundle and are proportional to the square of the frame-stiffness modulus, $g$.
  philosophy: |
    This term grounds non-Abelian forces as an emergent, mechanical property of a physical medium rather than an abstract mathematical axiom. It posits that the strong and weak forces are manifestations of the medium's resistance to shearing its degenerate temporal basis, unifying force with the geometry of an internal, multi-component time.
pirouette_definition: |
  The emergent energy density describing the dynamics of a non-Abelian gauge field. It represents the energetic cost, or "stiffness," of deforming the local basis of a degenerate temporal-resonance frame (e.g., the SU(2) temporal triad or SU(3) temporal-color basis). This cost is proportional to the squared curvature $F_{\mu\nu}$ of the connection $A_\mu$ that maintains coherence between frames at different spacetime points. The term naturally includes self-interactions, as the frame's curvature depends non-linearly on the connection itself.

          In hadron colliders, measure the production rates and angular distributions of events with three or more jets. The relative rates of 3-jet and 4-jet events, and their kinematic distributions, are sensitive to the triple-gluon and quartic-gluon vertices, which are direct consequences of the non-linear terms in $\mathcal{L}_{\rm YM}$.

      The medium’s energy density increases when the internal frame twists across spacetime. The **Yang–Mills Lagrangian** emerges:
      $$ \mathcal{L}_{\rm YM} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}^a F^{a,\mu\nu} $$
      with coupling $g$ now identified as the **temporal-frame stiffness scale**. The linear $(\partial A)$ part is the cost of **inhomogeneous frame relabeling**. The nonlinear $([A,A])$ part encodes the **curvature of the frame bundle**: changing the local basis in two directions fails to commute ⇒ self-interaction of the gauge bosons.

        The term is mathematically identical to the kinetic term for non-Abelian gauge fields in the Standard Model Lagrangian. Pirouette reinterprets this established mathematical structure as the emergent energy density associated with the stiffness of an internal, degenerate temporal frame, with the coupling constant $g$ serving as the stiffness modulus.

  disambiguation: |
    This term refers specifically to the kinetic energy and self-interaction of the gauge fields themselves, not the complete Lagrangian for a gauge theory, which would also include matter fields and their interactions ($\mathcal{L}_{\rm matter}$). It is the non-Abelian generalization of the Maxwell Lagrangian ($\mathcal{L}_{\rm Maxwell} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$), which lacks the self-interaction term.

# Yang–Mills Lagrangian

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The emergent energy density describing the dynamics of a non-Abelian gauge field, representing the energetic cost of deforming the local basis of a degenerate temporal-resonance frame (e.g., the SU(2) temporal triad or SU(3) temporal-color basis). This "stiffness" cost is proportional to the squared curvature $F_{\mu\nu}$ of the connection $A_\mu$ that maintains coherence between frames at different spacetime points. The term naturally includes self-interactions, as the frame's curvature depends non-linearly on the connection itself.

## EFT-First Summary
The Yang–Mills Lagrangian is mathematically identical to the gauge-field kinetic term in the Standard Model of Particle Physics, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm YM} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}^a F^{a,\mu\nu}$. It governs the propagation and self-interaction of gauge bosons like W, Z, and gluons. The Pirouette Framework provides a mechanical origin story for this term, deriving it from the stiffness of an underlying temporal medium, thereby grounding abstract gauge symmetry in a physical principle of frame coherence.
