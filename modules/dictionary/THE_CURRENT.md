  art: |
    A river of resonance flowing through a landscape of coherence, not pushed by a force from behind, but drawn forward by the promise of its own stability downstream.
  law: |
    A system's dynamics, conventionally described as its response to forces, are governed by its trajectory along a geodesic in a manifold of coherence, following the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The apparent force is proportional to the gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian (F ‚àù ‚àáùìõ_p).
  philosophy: |
    The Current reframes "force" not as an external imposition, but as an internal, teleological drive. It replaces the billiard-ball causality of classical physics with a universal imperative for systems to seek and maintain their own resonant integrity.
pirouette_definition: |
  The universal, coherence-seeking dynamic of a system. The Current is not a flow of conserved charge in the conventional sense, but the process by which any system follows a geodesic on its coherence manifold to maximize its temporal coherence (K_œÑ). Its apparent motion is a "flight towards stability" down the gradients and through the curls of this manifold, which manifest as electric and magnetic fields.

This vector field, conventionally the Electric Field (E), is interpreted as the local gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian (‚àáùìõ_p). The Current is the inferred trajectory the particle would take along this gradient field to maximize coherence.

    excerpt: |
      This immediately explains electrostatic attraction and repulsion without invoking a force. Two positive charges, placed near each other, create an environment of intense in-phase resonance. To maximize their individual coherence, they will naturally move apart, seeking regions where that resonant pressure is lower. Their repulsion is a flight towards greater internal stability.

    excerpt: |
      We have not simply relabeled electromagnetism; we have derived its essential character from a deeper principle... The Current is the flow of resonance seeking stability. The Compass is the geometry of the landscape it must navigate. As the original module stated, they are the verse and the chorus of the same song.

    The Current (capitalized) refers to the universal Pirouette dynamic of coherence-seeking flow. In the context of electromagnetism, this dynamic *results* in what is conventionally measured as electric current (lowercase), but the two terms are not interchangeable. The Current is the cause; electric current is the effect.

# The Current

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The universal, coherence-seeking dynamic of a system. The Current is not a flow of conserved charge in the conventional sense, but the process by which any system follows a geodesic on its coherence manifold to maximize its temporal coherence (K_œÑ). Its apparent motion is a "flight towards stability" down the gradients and through the curls of this manifold, which manifest as electric and magnetic fields.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of classical mechanics, The Current represents a system's adherence to the Principle of Least Action, where the action is defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p). The resulting equations of motion recover the Lorentz force law, with the electric and magnetic fields emerging as the gradient and curl, respectively, of potentials derived from ùìõ_p. This recasts electromagnetism as a geometric consequence of a coherence-optimization principle.
