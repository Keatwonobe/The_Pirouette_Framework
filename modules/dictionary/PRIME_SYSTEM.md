        A system with a prime number of modes is topologically irreducible. It is a "monolithic" entity, a single, flawless crystal. It has no simpler sub-symmetries or harmonic fracture planes that can be independently excited.

  art: |
    A bridge with seven pillars cannot be swayed by rhythms that would break a bridge of six. It is a structure made whole, its strength found not in its material but in its indivisible nature.
  law: |
    A system with a prime Mode Number (`N=p`) is topologically irreducible, lacks harmonic failure modes, and exhibits maximal Coherence Integrity (`Λ(p) = κ(p)/p`) for its scale, making it maximally resilient to a broad spectrum of temporal pressures.
  philosophy: |
    True endurance arises from indivisibility. By structuring a system's potential states according to a prime number, we design not just for function, but for a fundamental, mathematically-grounded integrity that resists fragmentation.
pirouette_definition: |
  A system whose total number of stable resonant states (Coherence Modes) is a prime number (`N=p`). Such systems are topologically irreducible, meaning their coherence manifold lacks the sub-harmonic "fracture planes" present in composite-mode systems. This monolithic structure grants them inherent, broad-spectrum resilience against decoherence from temporal pressure (Γ).

      - name: Mode Number Identification
        outline: |
          1. Identify the system's observable state space.
          2. Apply a temporal density-based clustering algorithm to the system's trajectory data to identify stable, recurring configurations (Coherence Modes).
          3. Count the number of distinct, stable clusters to determine the Mode Number, `N`.
          4. Perform a primality test on `N`. If prime, the system is a Prime System.
        expected_signals: [Well-separated clusters in state space, low intra-cluster variance, high inter-cluster variance.]
        pitfalls: [Miscounting modes due to observational noise, mistaking transient states for stable modes, system topology shifting during measurement.]

    excerpt: |
      **Prime Systems (`N=5`, `N=7`, etc.):** A system with a prime number of modes is topologically irreducible. It is a "monolithic" entity, a single, flawless crystal. It has no simpler sub-symmetries or harmonic fracture planes that can be independently excited. To perturb the system, one must perturb the *entire system* at once. This holistic entanglement provides a powerful, broad-spectrum resistance to a wide variety of temporal pressures, making the system inherently dissonance-resistant.

    excerpt: |
      The Weaver then identifies minimal, elegant interventions that could alter `N`. Could adding a new communication channel, removing an arbitrary constraint, or introducing a new shared goal shift an organization's topology from a fragile `N=4` to a more robust `N=5`? Could a new regulation shift a market from `N=6` to `N=7` stable equilibria?

      justification: |
        Simple groups in group theory are "atomic" as they have no non-trivial normal subgroups, meaning they cannot be broken down into smaller structural components. This is conceptually analogous to a Prime System's topological irreducibility, lacking sub-harmonic structures that can be independently excited.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette context, "Prime" always refers to the number-theoretic property of its Mode Number. It does not imply superiority in all contexts, only a specific topological resilience against fragmentation. A system with N=4 might be more efficient for a specific task, but a system with N=5 is predicted to be more durable.
