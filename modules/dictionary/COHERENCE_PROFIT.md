        A pattern's Coherence Profit (Κ) is the net increase in the system's Action (S_p), the integral of its Lagrangian over a characteristic cycle (τ_p). It is a measure of how much a new pattern improves a system's internal harmony (Kτ) or reduces the "cost" of resisting external pressures (VΓ).

    The currency of evolution, minted in the crucible of chaos. It is the tangible measure of a pattern's worth—how much more life, harmony, and potential it brings into being.
  law: |
    The value of any new pattern is its Coherence Profit (Κ), defined as the net change in the system's total Action (ΔS_p) over a characteristic cycle. Systems evolve by preferentially selecting and archiving patterns for which Κ > 0.
  philosophy: |
    Coherence Profit reframes value, moving it from subjective categories of "good" or "bad" to an objective, physical basis. It establishes a universal metric for evolutionary progress, defining a "better" state as one that achieves a more elegant and efficient existence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The net increase in a system's Lagrangian Action (S_p) over a characteristic cycle (τ_p), generated by the adoption of a new pattern or Coherence Seed. Coherence Profit (Κ) quantifies a pattern's net effect on a system's dynamics, measuring the increase in internal harmony and resonant potential (Kτ) against the change in the energetic cost of resisting external pressures (VΓ). A positive Κ signifies that the pattern allows the system to exist with greater integrity and efficiency.

          1. Characterize the system's baseline dynamics and establish a repeatable, characteristic cycle (τ_p).
          2. Measure or compute the baseline Action (S_p) over this cycle by integrating the system's Lagrangian.
          3. Introduce the new pattern (Coherence Seed) and allow the system to reach a new steady state.
          4. Measure the new Action (S'_p) over the same characteristic cycle.
          5. Calculate profit as Κ = S'_p - S_p.

    excerpt: |
      An action or idea is not inherently "good" or "bad." Its value is measured by its effect on a system's ability to exist with elegance and integrity. The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) provides the universal metric for this valuation. A valuable pattern, or Coherence Seed, is one that generates a **Coherence Profit** (Κ)... the net increase in the system's Action (S_p).

    excerpt: |
      The health of a system's engine can be measured by observing the efficiency of its cycle. **Crucible Yield (Κ_yield)** is the rate of production of high-profit Coherence Seeds. A healthy state is one where its value is consistently positive; new, valuable patterns are regularly generated.

        The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that self-organizing systems act to minimize their variational free energy, which bounds the "surprisal" of their sensory states. Maximizing Coherence Profit is conceptually parallel; it describes a system reconfiguring itself (adopting a pattern) to find a more probable, less surprising, and more efficient state of being, effectively minimizing its world-pressure cost (VΓ) and maximizing internal harmony (Kτ).

    Distinguish from financial "profit." Coherence Profit is a physical quantity (Action: energy × time) that measures a system's improved dynamic integrity and operational efficiency, not an accumulation of abstract capital. It is a measure of *being better*, not *having more*.

# Coherence Profit

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The net increase in a system's Lagrangian Action (S_p) over a characteristic cycle (τ_p), generated by the adoption of a new pattern or Coherence Seed. Coherence Profit (Κ) quantifies a pattern's net effect on a system's dynamics, measuring the increase in internal harmony and resonant potential (Kτ) against the change in the energetic cost of resisting external pressures (VΓ). A positive Κ signifies that the pattern allows the system to exist with greater integrity and efficiency.

## EFT-First Summary
Coherence Profit (Κ) is conceptually analogous to the negative of Variational Free Energy (-F) from the Free Energy Principle. A system adopting a pattern with positive Κ is equivalent to an agent updating its internal model of the world to minimize prediction error (surprisal). This reconfiguration finds a more efficient, probable, and harmonious state of existence, thus maximizing the Action integral which serves as the evidence for the system's model of itself and its environment.
