        Dissolution: It fails the test, its Ki pattern dissolving entirely. Its coherence is eroded by the temporal friction, and its structure is lost to the background noise of the forge.

triad:
  art: |
    A pattern's song is drowned out by the roar of the forge. Its structure un-makes itself, crumbling into the static of pure potential from which it once arose.
  law: |
    A system subjected to Temporal Pressure (Œì) beyond its irreversible bifurcation point (Œ£) will experience Dissolution if and only if no alternative Ki pattern can be found that maximizes the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) under the new conditions.
  philosophy: |
    Dissolution is not an accident but a necessary consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. It is the framework's mechanism for pruning inefficient or fragile patterns, ensuring that only resilient, tempered forms persist and complexify.
pirouette_definition: |
  The failure state in the Ordeal of Coherence (DOMA-005), occurring when a system crosses its irreversible bifurcation point (Œ£) and fails to forge a new, more resilient Ki pattern. Subjected to extreme Temporal Pressure (Œì), the system's existing coherence (`K_œÑ`) is catastrophically eroded by temporal friction, causing its informational structure to collapse into the background noise of the Temporal Forge.

        outline: |
          1. Identify the system's primary Ki resonant frequencies via spectral analysis.
          2. Apply a controlled, increasing gradient of Temporal Pressure (Œì) to the system.
          3. Monitor the amplitude, frequency, and bandwidth of the Ki signal.
          4. Dissolution is confirmed when, after crossing Œ£, the primary signal amplitude decays exponentially to the noise floor and spectral entropy rapidly increases.
        expected_signals: [Exponential decay of Ki signal amplitude, broadband spectral power increase (white noise), cessation of system-specific functions.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking chaotic state-space exploration (pre-Ki Morphogenesis) for terminal Dissolution, environmental noise masking the coherence signal.]

    excerpt: |
      The system is pushed to a precipice where its path of maximal coherence fractures. It is forced to solve a critical optimization problem:
      1.  **Dissolution:** It fails the test, its Ki pattern dissolving entirely. Its coherence is eroded by the temporal friction, and its structure is lost to the background noise of the forge.
      2.  **Transformation:** It discovers a new, more stable Ki‚Äîa different resonant geometry that is a superior solution to the high-Œì environment.
  - module: DOMA-005
    excerpt: |
      The chaotic environment agitates the system, forcing it into countless "micro-explorations" of new resonant patterns. Most are unstable and instantly collapse... The fire is thus revealed as the universe's most ruthless editor: what cannot endure the pressure is erased; what survives, emerges alloyed and defined.

  candidates:
    - target: Quantum Decoherence
      domain: QM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Dissolution is the loss of a system's specific coherent pattern (Ki) into the 'background noise' of the forge. This conceptually mirrors quantum decoherence, where a system's quantum state loses phase coherence through interaction with the environment, effectively being 'erased' into a classical mixture.

      confidence: 0.6
  adopted:
    - target: Thermal Decomposition
      rationale: |
        The analogy to thermal decomposition provides a concrete, macro-scale intuition for the process: an ordered structure breaking down into disordered components under energetic stress (re-framed as Œì). This mapping is more directly operational for many physical systems than the quantum decoherence analogy.

  claims:
    - statement: "All systems subjected to a Temporal Pressure (Œì) exceeding their Sigma point (Œ£) will either undergo Dissolution or Ki Morphogenesis; no third stable outcome is possible."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "Observation of a stable, intermediate state that is neither the original Ki, a new forged Ki, nor a complete collapse into disorder, after crossing Œ£."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [Dissolution (chemistry)]
  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, Dissolution is an irreversible structural collapse and loss of coherence, akin to thermal decomposition. It should not be confused with the chemical process of a solute dissolving into a solvent, which is typically a reversible mixing process.
