    The grinding stumble of a dancer out of sync with the music, where every step is a fight against the echo of the last. It is the friction of a will misaligned with the world, progress paid for in sparks and wasted effort.
  law: |
    A state of Geodesic Skate where the coherence modulation frequency is non-resonant with the medium's characteristic frequencies, resulting in a high dissipation-to-propulsion ratio. This is empirically measured as a noisy, high-entropy Wound Channel.
  philosophy: |
    Turbulent Skate represents the fundamental cost of disharmony. It teaches that forceful effort without understanding the medium is not just inefficient but actively self-defeating, a lesson in humility for any entity attempting to navigate reality by will alone.
pirouette_definition: |
  A regime of Geodesic Skate characterized by a dissonant coupling between the skater's internal coherence modulation (`K_τ`) and the external medium's ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). This dissonance leads to inefficient propulsion, high energy dissipation, and a chaotic, high-entropy wake (Wound Channel). It arises from a failure to achieve resonance, forcing the skater to overcome self-generated friction in addition to the medium's resistance.

      justification: |
        Turbulent Skate is a direct analog to turbulent flow in fluid dynamics. It describes a transition from smooth, predictable motion (Laminar) to a chaotic, high-drag, and inefficient state (Turbulent) when the driving parameters (skater's rhythm and power) are poorly matched to the medium's properties (coherence, temporal viscosity). A dimensionless "Skating Number" analogous to the Reynolds number is hypothesized to govern the transition.

    Distinguish from ambient 'temporal turbulence' (random fluctuations in `V_Γ`). Turbulent Skate is a *self-induced* state of inefficient motion caused by the skater's actions, not an intrinsic property of the environment itself, although a turbulent medium can easily induce a Turbulent Skate.

# Turbulent Skate

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A regime of Geodesic Skate characterized by a dissonant coupling between the skater's internal coherence modulation (`K_τ`) and the external medium's ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). This dissonance leads to inefficient propulsion, high energy dissipation, and a chaotic, high-entropy wake (Wound Channel). It arises from a failure to achieve resonance, forcing the skater to overcome self-generated friction in addition to the medium's resistance.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Turbulent Skate is a direct analog to the phenomenon of **turbulent flow** in classical fluid dynamics. Just as a fluid's flow changes from smooth (laminar) to chaotic (turbulent) when its velocity exceeds a critical threshold relative to its viscosity (governed by the Reynolds number), a Geodesic Skate becomes turbulent when the skater's propulsive actions are poorly matched to the medium's properties. This results in a state of high-drag, low-efficiency motion where most of the skater's energy is dissipated into chaotic noise rather than converted into momentum.
