      snippet: |
        Conscious access, modeled as a triadic resonance state (COG-RES-001), exhibits second-order transition behavior when the control parameter (Γ, cognitive load) approaches its critical value (Γ_c). From MATH-026, the relevant scaling relations are:
        [\xi_P \propto |T_a - T_c|^{-\nu_P}, \quad \tau_P \propto \xi_P^{z_P}]

  art: |
    As a system nears the breaking point, its movements slow to a glacial pace, a hush before the avalanche. Time itself stretches, revealing the universal pattern of collapse just before it happens. This stillness is not peace, but the gathering of a storm.
  law: |
    The relaxation time (τ_P) required for a system to recover from a small perturbation scales as a power law of its coherence correlation length (ξ_P), with an exponent z_P that is universal for its class. Specifically, τ_P ∝ ξ_P^(z_P). This relationship becomes measurable and dominant near a critical point.
  philosophy: |
    Dynamic scaling reveals that the way systems—from neural circuits to social networks—break down and recover follows universal mathematical laws, independent of their specific components. It implies that the dynamics of consciousness, when pushed to its limits, are not unique but are an expression of a fundamental class of physical phenomena, unifying cognitive science with statistical mechanics.
pirouette_definition: |
  The core methodology for analyzing how a system's characteristic timescale (τ) and spatial correlation length (ξ) diverge according to power laws as a control parameter (Γ) approaches a critical point (Γ_c). It provides quantitative, testable predictions for the behavior of systems near second-order phase transitions, focusing on the universal scaling exponents that govern their dynamics.
operational_definition:
  units: Scaling exponents are dimensionless. τ_P is in seconds (s), ξ_P is in meters (m) or electrode-distance units.

      - name: Critical Slowing Measurement via Perturbation
        outline: |
          1. Induce a stable state (e.g., Triadic Resonance) in a system under closed-loop monitoring (e.g., EEG).
          2. Systematically ramp a control parameter (Γ, e.g., cognitive load) towards the predicted critical point (Γ_c) where the state collapses.
          3. For each value of Γ, apply a small perturbation or observe spontaneous fluctuations.
          4. Measure the relaxation time (τ_P) it takes for the system to return to equilibrium.
          5. Simultaneously, calculate the spatial correlation length (ξ_P) from covariance matrices of system activity.
          6. Fit τ_P vs. (Γ_c - Γ) and τ_P vs. ξ_P on log-log plots to extract the scaling exponents.

        pitfalls: [Difficulty in precisely identifying Γ_c, contamination from non-critical dynamics, inter-subject variability requiring large sample sizes.]

  - module: COG-RES-002
    excerpt: |
      This module describes how to empirically measure and model the **dynamic scaling** of triadic resonance collapse in neural systems, verifying the renormalization flow predictions from [MATH-026]. It aims to detect critical slowing, coherence correlation lengthening, and universality in the temporal dynamics of conscious access.
  - module: COG-RES-002
    excerpt: |
      **Critical Slowing Hypothesis:** Near awareness collapse, neural recovery time (τ_P) diverges as (Γ → Γ_c).
      **Scaling Law Hypothesis:** τ_P obeys power-law scaling with coherence correlation length (ξ_P).
      **Universality Hypothesis:** Scaling exponents (ν_P, z_P) match Pirouette universality predictions derived in MATH-025–026.

        τ ~ ξ^z, where ξ ~ |T-T_c|⁻ᵛ
      justification: |
        The Pirouette framework's approach to awareness collapse directly maps to the theory of dynamic critical phenomena in statistical mechanics. The relaxation time (τ_P) and correlation length (ξ_P) are analogous to the order parameter relaxation time and correlation length in a system near a second-order phase transition. The predicted exponents z_P ≈ 2 and ν_P ≈ 0.5 are consistent with a non-conserved order parameter, such as in the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model (Model A).

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The term 'Dynamic Scaling' is a standard, well-defined concept in statistical physics. Its use in Pirouette is an intentional adoption, not a collision, to ground cognitive dynamics in established physical theory.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'scalability' in engineering, which refers to a system's ability to handle growing amounts of work. Dynamic Scaling specifically refers to the power-law relationships governing fluctuations and recovery times *near a critical point* or phase transition, a fundamentally different concept.
