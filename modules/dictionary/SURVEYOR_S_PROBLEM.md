  art: |
    How does one map a river's course from a handful of water? The problem lies not in the scarcity of data, but in learning to see the landscape's shape reflected in the water's flow.
  law: |
    Given a sparse set of time-ordered state vectors {x(t‚ÇÅ), x(t‚ÇÇ), ...}, one can infer the qualitative ratio of Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ) to Temporal Pressure (V_Œì) in the system's Lagrangian. The path's internal regularity (e.g., low variance, periodicity) is a proxy for K_œÑ, while its overall dispersion and volatility is a proxy for V_Œì.
  philosophy: |
    The Surveyor's Problem reframes sparse data from a limitation to a clue. It replaces the brittle goal of quantitative parameter estimation with the more robust and profound goal of qualitative diagnosis, shifting the core question from "What are the system's parameters?" to "What is the story of the system's struggle?"
pirouette_definition: |
  The inverse problem of inferring the qualitative shape of a system's Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`), and thereby its dynamic state, by observing a sparse set of points assumed to lie upon its coherence-maximizing geodesic path. It is solved via the Surveyor's Protocol, a heuristic for diagnosing the balance between a system's internal rhythm (`K_œÑ`) and the environmental pressure it endures (`V_Œì`).

        outline: |
          1. **Posit Geodesic:** Connect observed data points to form a tentative path in state space.
          2. **Assess Rhythm:** Measure the path's internal consistency (e.g., using normalized variance or phase coherence) to infer the strength of `K_œÑ`. High consistency implies high `K_œÑ`.
          3. **Assess Pressure:** Measure the path's overall dispersion and volatility (e.g., using a dispersion metric or jump frequency) to infer the magnitude of `V_Œì`. High dispersion implies high `V_Œì`.
          4. **Synthesize Diagnosis:** Map the inferred (High/Low `K_œÑ`, High/Low `V_Œì`) pair to a canonical dynamic state from `DYNA-001`.
        expected_signals: [Laminar Flow, Turbulent Flow, Resilient Struggle, Coherence Erosion]
        pitfalls: [Misinterpreting instrumental noise as high `V_Œì`, assuming points from different system epochs lie on the same geodesic, having too few points (<3) to establish a credible path.]

    excerpt: |
      The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) states that a system will always evolve along a path that maximizes its coherence. The Surveyor's Problem is the inverse: given a few points *on* that path, what is the shape of the landscape the path traverses? We are not estimating disconnected variables. We are taking a qualitative reading of the two fundamental terms of the system's Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`.
  - module: DOMA-186
    excerpt: |
      This entire protocol is a heuristic for solving an inverse problem. Standard physics uses the Lagrangian to predict the path; the Surveyor's Art uses the path to infer the Lagrangian. The final diagnostic statement‚Äî"The data suggests a system in a state of Resilient Struggle"‚Äîis a direct, physical claim about its governing dynamics.

        The process infers underlying causes (the Lagrangian field) from observed effects (the system's path), which is the definition of an inverse problem. This is analogous to inferring a planet's mass from a satellite's orbit or using seismic data to map Earth's interior.

# Surveyor's Problem

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The inverse problem of inferring the qualitative shape of a system's Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`), and thereby its dynamic state, by observing a sparse set of points assumed to lie upon its coherence-maximizing geodesic path. It is solved via the Surveyor's Protocol, a heuristic for diagnosing the balance between a system's internal rhythm (`K_œÑ`) and the environmental pressure it endures (`V_Œì`).

## EFT-First Summary
The Surveyor's Problem is a conceptual and operational mapping of the classic mathematical **Inverse Problem** into the Pirouette Framework. Whereas a forward problem uses a known model (the Lagrangian) to predict data (the path), the Surveyor's Problem uses observed data (a sparse path) to infer the properties of the underlying model (the qualitative shape of the Lagrangian). This approach is common across physics, from geophysics to medical imaging, and here it is used to perform a qualitative diagnosis of a system's dynamic state.
