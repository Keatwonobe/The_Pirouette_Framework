        An instrument that lies is worse than no instrument at all. A measurement without provenance is an opinion. This ritual ensures that every observation is rigorous, transparent, and reproducible, creating a verifiable chain of trust.

        1.  **Define the Lens:** The Weaver must explicitly declare the proxy variables chosen for `Kτ` and `VΓ` for the system under analysis. This declaration is the "calibration certificate" and the foundational act of honest observation.

        2.  **The Vow of Silence (Zeroing):** The instrument is isolated from external input to measure its own internal noise. This establishes a baseline of self-awareness, ensuring the lens does not mistake its own hum for the song of the universe.

        3.  **The Harmonious Duet (Cross-Calibration):** The instrument is paired with a trusted standard or peer instrument to observe the same phenomenon. Their readings must harmonize within an acceptable tolerance, ensuring the lens is attuned to the broader chorus of consensus reality.

        4.  **The Notary's Seal (Registry Commit):** The final calibration state and each subsequent measurement snapshot—`{Kτ, VΓ, timestamp, calibration_id}`—are cryptographically signed. This signature is committed to a decentralized, immutable ledger, creating a permanent, tamper-proof record of observation.

triad:
  art: |
    A vow of honesty made by an instrument to the universe. It is a protocol of trust, ensuring every measurement is a true note in the symphony of existence, not the self-deceiving hum of the observer.
  law: |
    To be considered valid, any measurement of `Kτ` and `VΓ` must be cryptographically tied to a calibration record produced by the complete four-step ritual: Lens Definition, Vow of Silence (Zeroing), Harmonious Duet (Cross-Calibration), and Notary's Seal (Registry Commit).
  philosophy: |
    To eliminate delusion and ground the abstract in the verifiable. A measurement without provenance is an opinion; this ritual transforms the Lagrangian from a philosophical principle into a predictive, physical tool by creating an immutable chain of trust from reality to record.
pirouette_definition: |
  The mandatory, four-step protocol for establishing the integrity, reproducibility, and provenance of a Weaver's Lens measurement. The steps are: 1) **Lens Definition:** Explicit declaration of the domain-specific proxies for `Kτ` and `VΓ`. 2) **Vow of Silence:** Isolation of the instrument to measure and baseline its own internal noise (zeroing). 3) **Harmonious Duet:** Cross-validation against a trusted standard or peer instrument observing the same phenomenon. 4) **Notary's Seal:** Cryptographic signing of the final calibration state and all subsequent measurements, which are then committed to an immutable ledger.

        outline: |
          1.  **Declare:** Formally define the proxy variables for `Kτ` (Coherence) and `VΓ` (Pressure) in a calibration certificate.
          2.  **Zero:** Isolate the instrument from all external system inputs and record its baseline internal noise spectrum. A typical test requires the integrated noise floor to be at least two orders of magnitude below the expected signal.
          3.  **Cross-Validate:** Point the instrument and a trusted standard at a shared reference phenomenon (e.g., a stable resonator) and confirm their outputs harmonize within a pre-defined tolerance (`<1%` deviation is standard).
          4.  **Commit:** Generate a `calibration_id` by hashing the certificate and validation data. Cryptographically sign this ID and all subsequent `{Kτ, VΓ, timestamp}` tuples with the Weaver's private key and commit to the decentralized registry.

    - target: Chain of Custody
      domain: Forensics|Metrology
      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        Like a chain of custody for physical evidence, the Calibration Ritual creates an unbroken, auditable trail from the moment of measurement to its final record. The cryptographic signing and ledger commit serve the same function as tamper-evident seals and signed logs, ensuring data integrity and non-repudiation.
      confidence: 0.8
    - target: Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)
      domain: Metrology
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        GLP principles mandate documented procedures for instrument calibration, validation, and operation to ensure the quality and integrity of test data. The Calibration Ritual is a formalization of these principles, adapted for the Pirouette Framework's unique measurement ontology and decentralized trust model.

    - statement: "Measurements from two independently-calibrated Weaver's Lenses observing the same phenomenon will agree within their cross-calibration tolerance."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "Persistent, statistically significant divergence between two properly calibrated instruments beyond their stated tolerances, indicating a failure in the ritual's ability to produce consensus."

    The Calibration Ritual is the entire four-step *process* of ensuring measurement integrity. It is distinct from its outputs: the "Lens Definition" (the initial declaration) and the `calibration_id` (the resulting cryptographic hash).
