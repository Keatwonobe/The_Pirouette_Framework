        The Doubling Effect: The magnetic moment mu is a measure of the energy change per unit of magnetic field, which is coupled to the full 720° cycle of the resonance. However, the spin angular momentum S is conventionally defined by the physics of a 360° rotation. When we calculate the ratio, we are comparing a phenomenon (mu) that operates on a 720° cycle to a definition (S) that operates on a 360° cycle.

    A resonance's true journey takes two turns to complete its song. Our one-turn ruler measures this dance and declares its step twice as long.
  law: |
    Any system whose state returns to identity only after a 720° rotation (a spinor) will exhibit a gyromagnetic ratio (g) of exactly 2 when its magnetic moment (native to the 720° cycle) is measured against its angular momentum (conventionally defined on a 360° cycle).
  philosophy: |
    This effect reframes the electron's g-factor from an anomalous quantum number to a necessary geometric consequence. It demonstrates that "quantum weirdness" can emerge from the mismatch between the underlying topology of a phenomenon and the classical, Euclidean conventions used to measure it.

  The geometric factor of 2 that arises when comparing a physical quantity coupled to a spinor's full 720° topological cycle (like magnetic moment) with a quantity conventionally defined relative to a 360° spatial rotation (like spin angular momentum). It is the mathematical consequence of modeling a spin-1/2 particle as a resonance with a path function `P(theta) = exp(i*theta/2)`, which requires two full rotations to return to its initial state.

          Place a sample containing unpaired electrons in a strong, static magnetic field `B_0`. Apply a microwave-frequency field `B_1` perpendicular to `B_0`. Sweep the frequency or field until resonance occurs, where photons are absorbed, flipping the electron spin state. The resonance condition `hν = gμ_B*B_0` allows direct calculation of `g`.

    excerpt: |
      We will demonstrate that any stable, self-sustaining resonance ("soliton") in the coherence field that possesses a two-cycle (720°) return path must behave as a spin-1/2 particle. We will then prove that this two-cycle nature geometrically guarantees that its baseline gyromagnetic ratio (g) is exactly 2, not as a coincidence, but as a direct and unavoidable consequence of its topology.

    excerpt: |
      The g-factor of 2 is not a magical quantum number. It is the geometric conversion factor between a system that lives in a 720° world and our 360° definitions of its properties. This proof is a cornerstone of the framework. It demonstrates that what we call "quantum mechanics" is, in many cases, the logical and inevitable consequence of a universe built on the geometry of resonance.

        The Doubling Effect provides a topological/geometric derivation for the Dirac equation's prediction that the electron's intrinsic g-factor is exactly 2. It reinterprets this value not as a fundamental constant but as a ratio of cycles. The small deviation from 2 (gₑ ≈ 2.0023) is attributed in QED to radiative corrections, which are not accounted for in this base topological model.

    This effect describes the origin of the integer `2` in the g-factor. It should not be confused with the 'anomalous magnetic moment,' which refers to the small deviation *from* 2 (`g-2`) arising from higher-order corrections.

# The Doubling Effect

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The geometric factor of 2 that arises when comparing a physical quantity coupled to a spinor's full 720° topological cycle (like magnetic moment) with a quantity conventionally defined relative to a 360° spatial rotation (like spin angular momentum). It is the mathematical consequence of modeling a spin-1/2 particle as a resonance with a path function `P(theta) = exp(i*theta/2)`, which requires two full rotations to return to its initial state.

## EFT-First Summary
The Doubling Effect is the Pirouette Framework's topological explanation for the electron g-factor (`g_e`) being almost exactly 2. While the Dirac equation predicts `g_e=2` as a consequence of relativistic quantum mechanics, Pirouette derives it as a geometric ratio: the 720° cycle of the electron's magnetic moment measured against the 360° convention for its spin angular momentum. This provides a direct mathematical mapping to the well-established g-factor in the Standard Model.
