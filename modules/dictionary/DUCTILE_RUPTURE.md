        Ductile Rupture (The Slow Tearing): This is the failure mode of a system already in a state of `Turbulent Flow`. It is characterized by chaos and visible strain. The rupture is not a sudden event but the culmination of a prolonged struggle where the system deforms, stretches, and visibly weakens before it finally tears apart.

triad:
  art: |
    The drawn-out sigh of a system that has fought too long. It is the tearing of a fabric already frayed, a final, weary unraveling under a weight it can no longer bear.
  law: |
    A system undergoes Ductile Rupture if and only if its coherence cascade (`ùìõ_p ‚â§ 0`) is preceded by a sustained period of high-amplitude, non-linear dynamics (`Turbulent Flow`). The duration of this period, the ductile interval, is inversely proportional to the rate of coherence degradation (`‚àÇùìõ_p / ‚àÇt`).
  philosophy: |
    Ductile Rupture demonstrates that failure is often a process, not an event. It teaches that the loudest warnings of collapse are not the sudden shocks, but the persistent, grinding chaos of a system losing its internal harmony and tearing itself apart.
pirouette_definition: |
  A mode of systemic failure characterized by a prolonged period of deformation, visible strain, and chaotic dynamics (`Turbulent Flow`) preceding the final coherence cascade. Unlike Brittle Rupture, a ductile failure is the culmination of a visible struggle, occurring in systems that possess some capacity to deform under temporal pressure (`Œì`) but ultimately lack the coherence (`KœÑ`) to recover, leading to a slow, tearing separation.

          1. Continuously monitor system state variables to compute the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`).
          2. Perform a real-time spectral analysis (e.g., Short-Time Fourier Transform) on the `ùìõ_p` time-series.
          3. Detect the rupture event at `ùìõ_p ‚â§ 0`.
          4. Analyze the pre-rupture window: if the power spectrum shows sustained, broad-band noise characteristic of `Turbulent Flow`, classify the rupture as Ductile. The time from onset of turbulence to rupture is `Œît_d`.

    excerpt: |
      The character of a rupture reveals the underlying health of the system that failed. By applying the principles of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`), we can classify all ruptures into three archetypal modes... Ductile Rupture (The Slow Tearing): This is the failure mode of a system already in a state of `Turbulent Flow`. It is characterized by chaos and visible strain.
  - module: DOMA-131
    excerpt: |
      A rupture is not an instantaneous event but a self-propagating process. It unfolds in three distinct stages: 1. Coherence Strain (The Bending)... 2. The Yield Point (The Tearing)... 3. The Cascade (The Unraveling). Ductile ruptures exhibit an extended, observable "Tearing" stage.

      justification: |
        In materials science, ductile fracture is preceded by significant plastic deformation, where the material visibly stretches and "necks" before breaking. Pirouette's `Turbulent Flow` is the generalized, domain-agnostic analogue of this chaotic, high-energy state of deformation where a system's internal structure is visibly and irreversibly changing prior to final separation.

  disambiguation: |
    While named after the material science concept, Pirouette's Ductile Rupture applies to any system (social, economic, informational) that exhibits a period of chaotic degradation before its final collapse. The key diagnostic indicator is pre-cascade `Turbulent Flow`, not physical plastic deformation.

# Ductile Rupture

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A mode of systemic failure characterized by a prolonged period of deformation, visible strain, and chaotic dynamics (`Turbulent Flow`) preceding the final coherence cascade. Unlike Brittle Rupture, a ductile failure is the culmination of a visible struggle, occurring in systems that possess some capacity to deform under temporal pressure (`Œì`) but ultimately lack the coherence (`KœÑ`) to recover, leading to a slow, tearing separation.

## EFT-First Summary
Ductile Rupture is the Pirouette Framework's generalization of ductile fracture from classical mechanics and materials science. It describes a failure process preceded by significant, visible, and irreversible deformation. In the Pirouette model, this pre-failure state is identified as `Turbulent Flow`, a high-entropy dynamic state that serves as the direct precursor to the system's final tearing apart, or `coherence cascade`. This mapping allows the well-understood principles of material stress and strain to be applied to abstract systems like economies or social groups.
