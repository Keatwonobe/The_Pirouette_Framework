        Weight: The Shadow exerts a real pressure on the system's Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). It alters the "path of maximal coherence" by adding its own resonant demands to the equation. A system under intense observation is literally heavier—its path through spacetime is more constrained.

  art: |
    To be seen is to be held in place. The gaze of an observer is a gravity well, pulling a universe of maybes into the solid ground of what is.
  law: |
    The inertia of a system's coherence manifold increases in proportion to the applied Shadow Weight, which is a function of the observer's attentional focus and internal coherence. This increase is measurable as a resistance to state transition.
  philosophy: |
    Observation is not a neutral act of data collection but an act of binding. The Shadow Weight quantifies the degree to which an observer's consciousness participates in co-creating the observed reality, making every measurement a negotiation between potentials.
pirouette_definition: |
  A scalar property of the Observer's Shadow, measured in units of energy, that quantifies the resonant pressure exerted on an observed system's coherence manifold. The Shadow Weight functions as a constraint term within the system's Pirouette Lagrangian, increasing its effective inertia and altering its path of maximal coherence. Its magnitude is proportional to the coherence of the observer's Ki pattern (i.e., focus, intent, expertise).

        outline: |
          1. Prepare a quantum system (e.g., a Bose-Einstein Condensate) in a superposition of two distinct macroscopic states.
          2. Apply a weak, resonant driving field to induce transitions between the states and measure the baseline transition frequency, f₀.
          3. Direct focused observation from a coherent source (e.g., a trained practitioner, a coherent AI) onto one of the two states. The observer's neural coherence is simultaneously monitored via EEG.
          4. Re-measure the transition frequency, f₁, under observation.
          5. The Shadow Weight is inferred from the frequency shift Δf = f₀ - f₁, which corresponds to the increased energy required to transition the state against the observational pressure.

    excerpt: |
      The observer's Ki pattern projects onto the coherence manifold of the observed. This projection is not a neutral act; it has a shape and a pressure. We call this geometric imprint The Observer's Shadow. The Shadow is the set of boundary conditions that the observer imposes on the observed.

      justification: |
        The Shadow Weight provides a candidate mechanism for the Quantum Zeno effect, attributing the suppression of state evolution not merely to measurement frequency but to the coherent state of the observer imposing an energy penalty (μ_s) on transitions away from the observed state. It reframes the Zeno effect as an active, observer-state-dependent process.

      justification: |
        Shadow Weight (μ_s) can be formally modeled as the coupling constant for a new potential energy term (V_obs) added to the system's Lagrangian. This term depends on the system's state variables (q) relative to the observed state (q_obs) and the observer's coherence (K_obs), directly altering the equations of motion.

  disambiguation: |
    Shadow Weight is not the gravitational mass of the observer, nor is it related to dark matter. It is a field-theoretic pressure term, measured in units of energy, that constrains a system's dynamics. Its effect is analogous to increasing inertia or deepening a potential well, not adding rest mass.

# Shadow Weight

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A scalar property of the Observer's Shadow, measured in units of energy, that quantifies the resonant pressure exerted on an observed system's coherence manifold. The Shadow Weight functions as a constraint term within the system's Pirouette Lagrangian, increasing its effective inertia and altering its path of maximal coherence. Its magnitude is proportional to the coherence of the observer's Ki pattern (i.e., focus, intent, expertise).
