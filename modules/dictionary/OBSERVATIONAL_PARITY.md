        Its purpose is to guarantee **Observational Parity**: the principle that human intuition and machine calculation are two equally valid instruments for exploring reality. A time-stream of data from any compliant source—whether a live observation of a human system or a high-frequency numerical simulation—can be ingested and understood by the same analytical tools.

  art: |
    The world's chaotic stage and the machine's silent dream are recorded with the same pen. Observational Parity is the unbroken thread ensuring that the story told by direct experience and the story explored by computation can be woven into the same tapestry of understanding.
  law: |
    Any analytical process or tool MUST be agnostic to the `source_type` field of a Chronoscript record. Given two data streams identical except for their `source_type` (`observation` vs. `simulation`), the analytical outputs must be identical.
  philosophy: |
    This principle exists to dissolve the schism between intuition and calculation. By treating data from human-led rituals and computational models as equals, it establishes a unified epistemology where insight from one can directly seed, calibrate, and validate the other in a self-improving loop.
pirouette_definition: |
  The core principle, enforced by the Chronoscript protocol, that data streams from live, real-world observation (`rituals`) and from computational modeling (`simulations`) are structured identically and are therefore equally valid and fully interchangeable. Any compliant analytical tool must be able to ingest and process a time-stream of Chronoscript records without regard to its `source_type`, enabling a seamless autopoietic loop between real-world measurement and model-based exploration.

      - name: Parity Compliance Audit
        outline: |
          1. Generate a valid Chronoscript record `R_obs` with `source_type: observation`.
          2. Create a perfect copy of the record, `R_sim`, changing only the `record_id` and setting `source_type: simulation`.
          3. Ingest `R_obs` into the analytical tool under test and record the output `O_obs`.
          4. Ingest `R_sim` into the same tool and record the output `O_sim`.
          5. Parity is maintained if and only if `O_obs` is identical to `O_sim`. Any deviation indicates a parity violation.
        expected_signals: [Identical downstream analytical reports, state predictions, or coherence scores.]
        pitfalls: [Hard-coded logic branching on the `source_type` field, floating-point precision errors causing minor deviations mistaken for parity violations, improper schema validation.]

    excerpt: |
      To analyze a system, one must first be able to listen to it. The old framework created a schism between the language of the living world, captured through *rituals*, and the language of the machine, captured through *simulations*. This created an unnecessary and lossy translation step. The Weaver's Chronoscript protocol establishes a single, unified, and time-first data contract. Its purpose is to guarantee **Observational Parity**.
  - module: DOMA-029
    excerpt: |
      The unification of `observation` and `simulation` data streams enables a powerful feedback loop: 1. **Observation:** A human-led ritual is performed, generating a stream of `observation` records... 2. **Calibration:** This real-world data is used to seed, tune, and validate a computational model... 3. **Simulation:** The model runs, generating a stream of `simulation` records... 4. **Analysis:** Both data streams, being in the same format, are fed into a single analytical engine... Data begets insight, which begets better data.

      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        V&V is the process of ensuring a computational model accurately represents both its conceptual description (verification) and the real world (validation). Observational Parity is the Pirouette Framework's *instrumentation* of the validation principle, creating a data contract that forces simulated data to be directly comparable to empirical data.

      justification: |
        The principle establishes a form of Turing Test for data streams. A compliant analytical system should be unable to distinguish between a "real" and a "simulated" history of a system's behavior based on the data's content alone, without checking the `source_type` label.

  claims:
    - statement: "A Pirouette-compliant analytical tool will produce identical outputs when fed two Chronoscript streams that are identical in all fields except for `record_id` and `source_type`."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "An audit (see Operational Definition) where an analytical tool produces different coherence scores, state predictions, or other outputs for two such streams would falsify its compliance with the principle."

naming_notes:
  collisions: ["Parity (P-symmetry) in particle physics."]
  disambiguation: |
    This term does not refer to parity in the sense of spatial inversion symmetry (P-symmetry) in physics. It refers to the equivalence or "parity of esteem" between two sources of data: direct observation and computational simulation, as enforced by a common data schema.
