    Once a new river is coaxed into its path, the banks must be shored up and the bed dredged deep. It is the patient work of turning a temporary trickle into a permanent, life-giving current.
  law: |
    The stability of a new Wound Channel increases proportionally to the density of coherent evidence, social reinforcement, and narrative integration applied post-adoption, decaying exponentially with time if left unreinforced.
  philosophy: |
    A moment of insight is fragile; it is the deliberate cultivation of that insight into a stable conviction that transforms a fleeting thought into a foundational truth. Grafting ensures that a new perspective is not merely visited, but inhabited.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fourth and final movement of the Weaver's Gambit (DOMA-160), Coherence Grafting is the set of actions taken to reinforce a newly adopted belief or perspective. It deepens the corresponding Wound Channel by integrating the new belief with the participant's core values, providing corroborating evidence and social proof, and exploring its positive implications. This process increases the belief's internal coherence, ensuring its long-term stability against temporal pressure (Γ) and preventing decay.

        outline: |
          1. A participant adopts a new target belief at time `t_adopt` via Coherence Sculpting.
          2. A specific grafting protocol (e.g., three follow-up reinforcing messages) is applied over a set duration.
          3. At `t_adopt + Δt`, the participant is exposed to a controlled dose of cognitive dissonance (e.g., counter-evidence, social counter-signal).
          4. Measure the belief reversion rate compared to a control group with no grafting. Grafting strength `σ_g` is inversely proportional to this rate.
        expected_signals: [Decreased latency in recalling/applying the new belief, increased self-reported confidence scores, spontaneous use of the new belief to explain novel phenomena.]
        pitfalls: [Over-grafting can lead to brittle dogma (a 'scar channel') rather than a flexible Wound Channel. Confounding variables from high ambient temporal pressure (Γ).]

    excerpt: |
      Once the participant steps onto the new path, the Weaver helps reinforce it. This act of Coherence Grafting involves exploring the new belief's implications, celebrating the newfound clarity, and connecting it back to core values. Repetition, evidence, and social proof help deepen the new Wound Channel until it becomes a stable, self-reinforcing feature of their cognitive landscape.

    excerpt: |
      The initial formation of an engram is an energy-intensive process, but its long-term persistence depends on subsequent stabilization. Without active Coherence Grafting, new insights are like trails in sand, quickly erased by the winds of habit and prior conditioning. The grafting process is analogous to synaptic potentiation, where repeated, coherent activation transforms a temporary connection into a durable structural change.

        Coherence Grafting mirrors the biological process of memory consolidation, where a labile, short-term memory trace is converted into a stable, long-term memory via LTP. Both processes involve reinforcement, repetition, and structural changes (deepening a Wound Channel vs. strengthening synaptic connections) to ensure persistence against decay and interference.

    Coherence Grafting is distinct from **Coherence Sculpting (DOMA-160)**, which is the broader, four-movement process of introducing a new belief. Grafting is specifically the *final* movement focused on stabilization *after* initial adoption. It should also not be confused with **Resonant Influence**, which is the initial act of casting the Observer's Shadow to create resonance.

# Coherence Grafting

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The fourth and final movement of the Weaver's Gambit (DOMA-160), Coherence Grafting is the set of actions taken to reinforce a newly adopted belief or perspective. It deepens the corresponding Wound Channel by integrating the new belief with the participant's core values, providing corroborating evidence and social proof, and exploring its positive implications. This process increases the belief's internal coherence, ensuring its long-term stability against temporal pressure (Γ) and preventing decay.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, Coherence Grafting is the Pirouette analog to synaptic consolidation in neuroscience, specifically Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). It describes the protocols used to reinforce a newly adopted state (belief) to prevent its decay back to a previous ground state. The process increases the "potential well depth" of the new belief within the coherence manifold, making it a more stable and permanent feature of the cognitive landscape.
