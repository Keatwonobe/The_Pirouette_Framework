        We assert the **Autopoietic Unity Condition**: a fundamental, self-sustaining unit of resonance defines its own scale. Its characteristic length (`R`) must be phase-locked to the fundamental measure of a cycle (`2π`).
        This condition sets the canonical radius of resonance:
        `R_unit = 2π`

    A system's first breath sets the size of its own world. The rhythm of its existence becomes the ruler by which it is measured, turning a cycle into a circumference.
  law: |
    The characteristic radius (`R_unit`) of a fundamental, self-organizing resonant unit is set equal to the dimensionless angular measure of a full cycle, `2π`, thereby fixing the geometric constants of its interaction arena.
  philosophy: |
    This condition eliminates arbitrary scale-dependence at the most fundamental level. It posits that existence is not imposed upon a pre-existing metric space, but that the act of coherent, cyclical existence *creates* its own characteristic scale, making the system a self-contained measure of reality.

  The Autopoietic Unity Condition is a foundational principle asserting that a fundamental, self-sustaining unit of resonance (a `Ki` pattern) defines its own spatial scale. It achieves this by setting its characteristic radius (`R`) to be numerically equal to the fundamental angular measure of a cycle (`2π`). This act of self-scaling phase-locks the system's geometry to its temporal periodicity, rendering the derived geometric constant of resonance (`Κ_g = 4π/3`) a universal, scale-invariant property of the arena itself.

        outline: |
          The condition is a theoretical postulate, not a directly measured quantity. Its validity is tested by measuring the consequences of the geometric constant `Κ_g ≈ 4π/3` that it fixes. This involves analyzing the interaction dynamics of presumed fundamental resonant systems for a scaling factor of `4π/3` in their coupling strengths, decay rates, or scattering cross-sections.

    excerpt: |
      For this `Κ_g` to be a universal constant of nature, not dependent on the size of a particular sphere, the radius `R` must itself be fixed by a fundamental principle. We assert the **Autopoietic Unity Condition**: a fundamental, self-sustaining unit of resonance defines its own scale. Its characteristic length (`R`) must be phase-locked to the fundamental measure of a cycle (`2π`). [...] Substituting this unity radius into our equation yields the universal constant for the fundamental resonance geometry: `Κ_g = 4π / 3`.

    excerpt: |
      The drive for coherence, when poured into the perfect vessel of a sphere, sings a single, constant tone. The value `4π/3` is not a number found by measurement; it is the universe's geometric taste made manifest. It is the signature of a sphere learning to hum, the precise ratio a pattern must honor to earn its existence.

        Analogous to setting a fundamental constant (`c`, `ħ`) to unity, this condition establishes a 'natural unit' of length. Instead of being based on an empirical phenomenon, it is derived from the mathematical constant `2π` defining a cycle, thereby linking the system's spatial measure directly to its periodic nature.

# Autopoietic Unity Condition

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Autopoietic Unity Condition is a foundational principle asserting that a fundamental, self-sustaining unit of resonance (a `Ki` pattern) defines its own spatial scale. It achieves this by setting its characteristic radius (`R`) to be numerically equal to the fundamental angular measure of a cycle (`2π`). This act of self-scaling phase-locks the system's geometry to its temporal periodicity, rendering the derived geometric constant of resonance (`Κ_g = 4π/3`) a universal, scale-invariant property of the arena itself.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to a normalization choice in effective field theory, the Autopoietic Unity Condition fixes the characteristic length scale of a fundamental entity by equating its radius to `2π`. This choice of 'natural units' renders geometric factors in the theory universal and scale-invariant, positing that a system's periodicity inherently defines its own spatial metric. This is akin to choosing units where a fundamental frequency corresponds to a fundamental size.
