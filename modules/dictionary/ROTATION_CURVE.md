    The orbital velocity V_c at a radius r is fixed by the total mass M(<r) enclosed within that radius, according to V_c(r) = √[GM(<r)/r].
  philosophy: |
    The rotation curve is the primary empirical battleground where abstract field theories of dark matter, like the Γ-soliton model, confront observable galactic dynamics. It translates a model's mass profile into a falsifiable velocity profile.
pirouette_definition: |
  The orbital velocity of a test particle in a stable circular orbit at a galactocentric radius `r`. It is derived from the total enclosed mass `M(<r)`, which is the volume integral of the total mass density `ρ_tot(r) = ρ_b(r) + ρ_Γ(r)`. In the Pirouette Framework, `V_c(r)` serves as a key observable for validating or falsifying Γ-soliton halo models against astrophysical data.

# Rotation Curve

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The orbital velocity of a test particle in a stable circular orbit at a galactocentric radius `r`. It is derived from the total enclosed mass `M(<r)`, which is the volume integral of the total mass density `ρ_tot(r) = ρ_b(r) + ρ_Γ(r)`. In the Pirouette Framework, `V_c(r)` serves as a key observable for validating or falsifying Γ-soliton halo models against astrophysical data.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette `Rotation Curve` is operationally identical to the standard quantity used in astrophysics (see Binney & Tremaine, *Galactic Dynamics*). It is the circular speed `V_c(r) = √[GM(<r)/r]` required for a stable orbit within a galaxy's gravitational potential. Its primary function within the framework is to serve as a direct, falsifiable prediction of Γ-soliton halo models, which generate a mass profile `ρ_Γ(r)` that, when combined with baryons, must reproduce observed galactic rotation curves.
