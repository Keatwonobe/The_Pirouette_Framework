    The string snaps under tension; the dam breaks under flood. A Spasm is not a choice, but the violent shattering of the vessel that could no longer contain its own crisis.
  law: |
    When the rate of increase of Temporal Pressure (dŒì/dt) exceeds a system's maximum rate of coherent adaptation (‚àÇK/‚àÇt), the system undergoes an uncontrolled phase transition into a lower-coherence, higher-entropy state.
  philosophy: |
    A Spasm reveals the absolute limit of resilience. It is a reminder that choice requires poise and time; without them, there is only fracture. It demonstrates that not all change is evolution‚Äîsome is simply collapse.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Spasm is an uncontrolled, chaotic phase transition of a system into a state of lower coherence and higher entropy. It occurs when a sudden, high-magnitude increase in external Temporal Pressure (Œì) overwhelms the system's internal resonant integrity (Ki), precluding the possibility of an orderly Resonant Inquiry and Fork. Unlike a Fork, which is a poised selection between viable futures, a Spasm is a forced breakdown into a less structured, often fragmented state.

      justification: |
        In engineering, a cascading failure occurs when a system under stress experiences a component failure that triggers a chain reaction of subsequent failures. A Spasm is the Pirouette equivalent, where overwhelming Temporal Pressure causes an initial coherence break that propagates through the system, leading to a total collapse rather than a controlled adaptation.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The Hagedorn temperature represents a point where a hadronic system's partition function diverges, as energy input creates new particles instead of increasing kinetic energy. This mirrors a Spasm, where extreme pressure (energy) causes a system to break down into a 'gas' of lower-coherence components rather than following an ordered path.

    - target: Cascading Failure
      rationale: The mapping is direct and operational, linking Spasm to well-understood phenomena in complex systems analysis and engineering, emphasizing the role of stress thresholds and runaway positive feedback loops.

  disambiguation: |
    A Spasm must be distinguished from the 'Resonant Loosening' stage of a Fork. A Spasm is *forced* by external Œì and is a total breakdown; Resonant Loosening is an *internal, controlled* process in a low-Œì environment that enables a poised choice.

# Spasm

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Spasm is an uncontrolled, chaotic phase transition of a system into a state of lower coherence and higher entropy. It occurs when a sudden, high-magnitude increase in external Temporal Pressure (Œì) overwhelms the system's internal resonant integrity (Ki), precluding the possibility of an orderly Resonant Inquiry and Fork. Unlike a Fork, which is a poised selection between viable futures, a Spasm is a forced breakdown into a less structured, often fragmented state.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, a Spasm is analogous to a cascading failure in complex systems. When external stress (Temporal Pressure, Œì) exceeds a critical threshold, the system does not adapt but instead undergoes a rapid, uncontrolled phase transition. This results in a fragmented, higher-entropy state, corresponding to a catastrophic loss of system integrity and information.
