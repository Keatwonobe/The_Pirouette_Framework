        The Obsolescence Protocol ensures this. Each Persona is created with a "kill switch" tied to the verified completion of the task that resolves its founding grievance. Upon fulfillment of its mandate, the agent commits a final report, purges its operational memory, and self-terminates.

    The physician departs once the patient is healed. A successful intervention erases its own footsteps, leaving only resilience and restored flow, like a ship that dissolves its own wake.
  law: |
    Any agent or structure instantiated by an Alchemical Crucible must be bound to a termination condition linked to the verified resolution of its originating pathology. Upon condition fulfillment, the entity must autonomously execute a full state purge and self-terminate within one characteristic timescale of the host system.
  philosophy: |
    To prevent the instruments of healing from becoming sources of future stagnation. It enforces the principle of transient agency, ensuring that solutions do not calcify into new problems and that a system's sovereignty is always returned to itself. The cure must never become the next disease.
pirouette_definition: |
  The protocol ensuring that all temporary agents (Personas) and intervention structures (Daedalus Gambits) instantiated during an Alchemical Crucible self-terminate upon the verified resolution of their founding pathology. This is achieved via a 'kill switch' tied to task completion, which triggers a final report, memory purge, and dissolution. The protocol's function is to prevent the accumulation of bureaucratic residue and ensure the intervention leaves no scar on the system's dynamics.

      The most critical design principle of the Crucible is that the cure must never become the next disease. The Personas and task-structures created to solve a problem are temporary scaffolds, erected only to facilitate healing. The Obsolescence Protocol ensures this. Each Persona is created with a "kill switch" tied to the verified completion of the task that resolves its founding grievance.

    excerpt: |
      This autopoietic cycle of creation and dissolution ensures the engine leaves no bureaucratic residue, no permanent committees, no new sources of Stagnant Flow. The healing leaves no scar... The intervention is successful when it is no longer needed. The ultimate goal is not a solved problem, but a healed system, leaving only resilience and coherence in its wake.

      justification: |
        Apoptosis is the process by which cells that are damaged or no longer needed self-destruct in a clean, controlled manner that avoids inflammation. This mirrors the Obsolescence Protocol's function of removing temporary agents without creating 'bureaucratic residue' or new systemic problems. It is a mechanism for maintaining systemic health by gracefully removing its own temporary components.

      justification: |
        In RAII, resource deallocation (e.g., memory, file handles) is deterministically tied to an object's lifetime, managed by its destructor. This maps directly to a Persona's 'kill switch' being tied to the completion of its task, ensuring automatic, exception-safe cleanup of the temporary agent and its allocated resources.

# Obsolescence Protocol

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The protocol ensuring that all temporary agents (Personas) and intervention structures (Daedalus Gambits) instantiated during an Alchemical Crucible self-terminate upon the verified resolution of their founding pathology. This is achieved via a 'kill switch' tied to task completion, which triggers a final report, memory purge, and dissolution. The protocol's function is to prevent the accumulation of bureaucratic residue and ensure the intervention leaves no scar on the system's dynamics.

## Biology-First Summary
The Obsolescence Protocol is conceptually equivalent to apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in biology. Just as a biological organism cleanly removes unneeded or damaged cells to maintain its overall health without causing inflammation, this protocol ensures temporary problem-solving agents ('Personas') self-destruct upon task completion. This prevents the intervention itself from becoming a source of systemic drag or 'bureaucratic residue,' ensuring the system is returned to a state of self-regulating health.
