        **Turbulent Eddies:** Regions marked by high `Γ` and low `Kτ`. These are phase transitions, chaotic events, or points of signal degradation. These regions will exhibit a **low, volatile CR**.

triad:
  art: |
    The chaotic froth of a river crashing against rocks; a momentary breakdown of smooth current into a swirling, energy-dissipating vortex. It is the sound of a system losing its song to overwhelming static.
  law: |
    A flow state is diagnosed as a Turbulent Eddy if, within a measurement window, its Dissonance (Γ) significantly exceeds its Coherence (Kτ), yielding a Coherence Ratio (CR = Kτ/Γ) that is both low (e.g., < 0.5) and volatile (high standard deviation across sequential windows).
  philosophy: |
    Turbulent Eddies are not mere noise; they are informationally significant events marking phase transitions, points of external shock, or the natural boundaries of a system's coherence. They signify where a system is either breaking down or reorganizing, making them critical loci for intervention and analysis.
pirouette_definition: |
  A diagnosed state of an information flow, identified within a Rhythmic Sieve analysis window, characterized by high Dissonance (Γ) and low Coherence (Kτ). This state corresponds to a low and volatile Coherence Ratio (CR), indicating a period where unstructured temporal pressure overwhelms the system's capacity to maintain a stable, predictable pattern. Turbulent Eddies signify signal degradation, chaotic transitions, or points of high informational friction.

    - name: Γ
      meaning: Dissonance; a measure of a segment's internal chaos, unpredictability, and noise.
      dimensions: Information (e.g., bits, nats)

    - name: Kτ
      meaning: Coherence; a measure of a segment's internal order, predictability, and resonant structure.
      dimensions: Information (e.g., bits, nats)
      default_range: "[0, ∞)"
    - name: CR
      meaning: Coherence Ratio (Kτ/Γ); the signal-to-noise ratio of a segment.

        outline: |
          1. Apply Rhythmic Segmentation to an information stream to define analysis windows.
          2. For each window, compute Coherence (Kτ) via autocorrelation or spectral analysis and Dissonance (Γ) via Shannon entropy or a similar metric.
          3. Calculate the Coherence Ratio (CR = Kτ/Γ) for each window.
          4. Identify temporal regions where Γ is consistently and significantly greater than Kτ, and CR is low and exhibits high variance.
        expected_signals: [CR < 0.5, high standard deviation of CR, spikes in Γ uncorrelated with Kτ]
        pitfalls: [Window size mismatch (a window too large may average out and hide an eddy), poor choice of Kτ or Γ estimators for the signal type.]

    excerpt: |
      To understand a river, one does not simply measure its volume. One must listen to its current, distinguish the steady flow from the turbulent eddy, and map the deep, silent channels hidden beneath the surface noise.
  - module: DOMA-181
    excerpt: |
      The final step is to interpret the Coherence Profile... to identify the dominant flow states:
      - **Laminar Channels:** Regions characterized by high, stable `Kτ` and low `Γ`.
      - **Turbulent Eddies:** Regions marked by high `Γ` and low `Kτ`. These are phase transitions, chaotic events, or points of signal degradation.

      domain: CM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Both phenomena describe a breakdown of smooth, predictable flow into a chaotic, high-entropy state. The Pirouette condition Γ >> Kτ is analogous to inertial forces overwhelming the ordering effect of viscous forces in a fluid, leading to energy dissipation (information loss).

      domain: SM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Near a critical point, a system's order parameter vanishes (low Kτ) and it exhibits large-scale fluctuations and high susceptibility (high Γ). A Turbulent Eddy models this transitional state where the old order has broken down but a new one has not yet formed.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A system undergoing a known chaotic transition (e.g., the onset of turbulence in a fluid, a critical market crash) will consistently be diagnosed with Turbulent Eddies by the Rhythmic Sieve protocol."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If such systems show high Coherence (Kτ) or low Dissonance (Γ) during their transition, or if their Coherence Ratio (CR) remains high and stable, the diagnostic's validity is falsified."

  disambiguation: |
    While named by analogy to fluid dynamics, a Pirouette 'Turbulent Eddy' is a diagnosis of an *information* flow, not a physical fluid. It refers to a state of high signal-to-noise degradation (high Γ, low Kτ), regardless of the underlying substrate.
