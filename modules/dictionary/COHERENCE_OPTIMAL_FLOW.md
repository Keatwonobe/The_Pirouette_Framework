        This defines the system's *ideal flow* assuming minimum entropy production.

  art: |
    The effortless path water finds downhill, a current of perfect exchange without turbulence or waste. It is the ghost of a system's best self, the dance of interactions as they ought to be.
  law: |
    **J**_opt_ is the vector field of social exchange that maximizes the action (\int \mathcal{L}_s dt), yielding the configuration with minimal entropy production. The difference between observed flow (\mathbf{J}_{obs}) and **J**_opt_ defines the measurable Dissonance Field (\mathbf{D}).
  philosophy: |
    **J**_opt_ provides a necessary theoretical baseline—an "ideal gas law" for social systems. Without this reference state of perfect coherence, it is impossible to quantify, measure, or ultimately remedy the dissonances and inefficiencies present in all real-world interactions.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence-optimal Flow, **J**_opt_, is the theoretical vector field representing the flow of social exchange (e.g., information, resources, mobility) within a system that maximizes the time-integrated Pirouette Lagrangian (\mathcal{L}_s). It describes the interaction pattern that minimizes intrinsic entropy production and serves as the ideal reference state. The deviation of the observed flow (\mathbf{J}_{obs}) from **J**_opt_ constitutes the residual flow, from which the Social Dissonance Field (\mathbf{D}) is derived.

        outline: |
          1. Define the system graph (nodes, edges, weights) and constraints (e.g., conservation of agents, resources).
          2. Formulate the societal Lagrangian (\mathcal{L}_s) based on system norms (T_a), social motion (\omega_k), tension (\Gamma), and substrate (S_{soc}).
          3. Solve the variational problem (\delta \int \mathcal{L}_s dt = 0) to find the flow field **J**_opt_ that maximizes the action. This is typically solved numerically by finding the flow that satisfies the system's Euler-Lagrange equations on the graph.
        expected_signals: [A stable vector field on the system graph representing the most efficient flow paths.]
        pitfalls: [Incorrect formulation of the Lagrangian \mathcal{L}_s, Numerical instability in the optimization process, Poorly defined boundary conditions or constraints.]

    excerpt: |
      The Social Dissonance Field (\mathbf{D}) quantifies the misalignment between the observed flow of interactions and the idealized coherence flow predicted by the Pirouette Lagrangian... (\mathbf{D}) measures the difference between the real and idealized fluxes.
  - module: SOCIO-FIELD-001
    excerpt: |
      To compute the Dissonance Field, one must first derive the coherence-optimal flow (\mathbf{J}_{opt}) by maximizing (\int \mathcal{L}_s dt) under domain constraints. This defines the system's *ideal flow* assuming minimum entropy production. The residual flow is then defined as (\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{J}_{obs} - \mathbf{J}_{opt}).

        **J**_opt_ describes a smooth, orderly, and maximally efficient flow, much like laminar flow in fluid dynamics. The observed, messy flow (\mathbf{J}_{obs}) with its curl components (\mathbf{A}) is analogous to turbulent flow, which introduces dissipative losses (entropy production).

      justification: |
        **J**_opt_ represents the lowest "energy" or least-dissipative state of social interaction, analogous to how a ground state represents the minimum energy configuration of a physical system. Both are theoretical baselines from which excitations or perturbations (dissonance) are measured.

  disambiguation: |
    Within the Pirouette Framework, **J** consistently refers to a flow or current. The subscript `opt` unambiguously denotes the theoretical, coherence-maximizing ideal, distinguishing it from the observed flow **J**_obs_ or other model flows.
