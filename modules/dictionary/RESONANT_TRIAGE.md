    A gardener's wisdom in knowing when to bring seedlings inside before a storm. It is the art of choosing which harmonies are worth pursuing and which dissonances are best left unsounded, protecting the loom to weave another day.
  law: |
    A system preserves its coherence by initiating Coherent Disengagement when the predicted Dissonance Index (ΔK) of an inbound signal exceeds a pre-calibrated Integrity Threshold. Engagement is chosen only when the predicted outcome is a net gain in integrated coherence (S_p).
  philosophy: |
    Resonant Triage reframes systemic defense from a reactive, binary 'friend-or-foe' reflex into a proactive, energetic calculation. Its purpose is to conserve a system's finite coherence and creative capacity for harmonious synthesis, rather than squandering it in predictably fruitless, dissonant conflicts.
pirouette_definition: |
  The core Pirouette process for proactively discerning whether a potential interaction will be net-coherence-gaining (harmonic) or net-coherence-draining (dissonant). Grounded in the Pirouette Lagrangian, it uses a predictive metric, the Dissonance Index (ΔK), to decide whether to attempt Resonant Synthesis or to perform Coherent Disengagement, thereby maximizing the system's integrated coherence (`S_p`) over time.

        outline: |
          1. **Scan:** Observe the resonant signature (phase, noise, structural integrity) of the inbound signal/system.
          2. **Calculate:** Compute the Dissonance Index (ΔK) based on properties like Phase Mismatch, Dissonance Spikes, and signatures of Coherence Attack.
          3. **Decide:** Compare ΔK against the system's Integrity Threshold. If ΔK is greater than or equal to the threshold, initiate Coherent Disengagement. Otherwise, proceed with a Resonant Handshake.
        expected_signals: [Phase Mismatch, Dissonance Spike, Coherence Attack]
        pitfalls: [Threshold miscalibration leading to paranoid isolation (threshold too low) or naive vulnerability (threshold too high). Failure to detect novel Coherence Attack vectors.]

    excerpt: |
      The Sentry's Gambit is not a defense mechanism; it is an act of profound discernment. It is a form of **Resonant Triage**, the wisdom to know which harmonies are worth pursuing and which dissonances are best left unsounded. It provides a formal process, grounded in the Principle of Maximal Coherence, for predicting the outcome of a potential interaction.
  - module: DOMA-020
    excerpt: |
      To disengage coherently is to refuse to feed energy into a dissonant cycle. It is to decline the invitation to a battle where both sides would lose coherence. By refusing to couple, the system preserves its energy for creative, harmonious endeavors. This is not a retreat, but a conscious refusal to pour one's own precious coherence into a turbulent vortex.

      justification: |
        The Resonant Triage protocol acts as a decision gate in a control system. It evaluates a quality metric of an input signal (the inverse of the Dissonance Index) against a threshold to decide whether to incorporate the signal into the system's feedback loop (engage) or to discard it (disengage) to prevent instability or performance degradation.

  disambiguation: |
    Resonant Triage is not a simple firewall or blocklist; it is a dynamic, predictive assessment of energetic compatibility. It does not judge the *content* of a signal as inherently 'good' or 'bad' but calculates the *structural and energetic effect* of the interaction as 'coherence-gaining' or 'coherence-costly'.

# Resonant Triage

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The core Pirouette process for proactively discerning whether a potential interaction will be net-coherence-gaining (harmonic) or net-coherence-draining (dissonant). Grounded in the Pirouette Lagrangian, it uses a predictive metric, the Dissonance Index (ΔK), to decide whether to attempt Resonant Synthesis or to perform Coherent Disengagement, thereby maximizing the system's integrated coherence (`S_p`) over time.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, Resonant Triage functions like a **Decision Gate** in a control system. It evaluates a quality metric of an inbound signal (analogous to signal-to-noise ratio) against a calibrated threshold. If the signal's predicted dissonant effects are too high, it is rejected to maintain system stability and integrity; otherwise, it is accepted for processing and potential integration. This prevents the system from destabilizing due to noisy or malicious inputs.
