        The Ritual is the "Art" component of the protocol, providing contextual wisdom where pure metrics fall short.
        Dual Mandate:
        1. Adjudication: To use the Wound Channel evidence to issue fair sanctions, remedies, or require corrective actions for the harm caused.
        2. Sense-Making: To analyze the nature of the boundary breach...and provide insights for recalibrating the Gates system-wide.

triad:
  art: |
    Where raw data meets wisdom, the Ritual convenes to interpret the story a wound tells, transforming a breach into a systemic lesson.
  law: |
    When a measured Wound Channel's integrated residue exceeds its predicted Gate Slack, the Ritual is automatically invoked to adjudicate consequence and recalibrate system parameters, using the Wound Channel Data Package as the sole evidentiary basis.
  philosophy: |
    The Ritual embodies Anticipatory Accountability by ensuring that boundary violations are not merely punished, but are integrated as systemic learning, making the system more resilient and coherent through its failures.
pirouette_definition: |
  A triggered, dual-mandate process that serves as the Sentinel Protocol's primary adjudication and sense-making mechanism. Invoked automatically when a measured Wound Channel exceeds its predicted tolerance (Gate Slack), the Ritual uses the objective Wound Channel Data Package to 1) issue sanctions and remedies for the harm caused, and 2) analyze the breach to provide adaptive feedback for recalibrating system-wide Dynamic Parametric Gates.

        outline: |
          1. Define a predicted Gate Slack for a given action.
          2. Execute the action and measure its resulting Wound Channel Data Package.
          3. Compare the integrated residue of the Wound Channel against the Gate Slack.
          4. Verify that the Ritual is invoked if and only if the residue exceeds the slack.

    excerpt: |
      Phase 3: Residual Audit & Ritual Trigger
      Mechanism: The measured Wound Channel is compared against the predicted tolerance, or "Gate Slack."
      Trigger: If the measured residue exceeds the slack, the Reflexive Boundary Ritual is automatically invoked.
  - module: PDM-001-Sentinel_Protocol-v2.0
    excerpt: |
      The Sentinel Protocol was co-designed with adversarial pressure in mind.
      Ritual Capture: Flooding the adjudication process with bad-faith disputes or noisy data.
      Countermeasure: The Ritual is only triggered by and must deliberate upon the objective Wound Channel data package, not on opinions.

      equation_hint:
      justification: |
        Like RCA, the Ritual analyzes a failure (boundary breach) to find its origin and systemic contributors. Like judicial review, it adjudicates consequences based on evidence. The Ritual uniquely combines both into a single, forward-looking adaptive feedback loop.

  claims:
    - statement: "The Ritual's sense-making output effectively recalibrates Dynamic Gates to prevent recurrence of similar boundary breaches."
      domain: phenomenology|simulation
      falsifier: "In a longitudinal simulation (e.g., Test Case 001: 'The Leaky Dam'), a specific type of breach, after being processed by the Ritual, recurs at the same or higher frequency, indicating the feedback loop is ineffective."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a purely punitive process. The Ritual's primary function is adaptive sense-making for the system's benefit; adjudication is a necessary but secondary component to ground this learning in consequence.
