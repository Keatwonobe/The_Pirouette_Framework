    Below the coherence barrier, QED is the quiet face of time-first dynamics—perfectly Lorentz, exactly gauge. It is the familiar echo of a deeper, temporal rhythm.
  law: |
    For all interaction scales μ ≪ ω_c, all electromagnetic observables, including the running of α, lepton g-2, and scattering cross-sections, must match Standard Model QED predictions within current experimental precision. Any deviation must be suppressed by powers of (μ/ω_c)².
  philosophy: |
    To introduce new fundamental physics without violating established experimental success. This limit serves as a bridge, ensuring that the novel microphysics of Pirouette (time-phase U(1)) grounds itself in empirical reality by recovering the tested and trusted framework of QED as its precise, low-energy effective theory.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Time-first QED limit is the effective field theory that describes the electromagnetic interaction below the coherence barrier frequency (ω_c ≈ 10²³ s⁻¹). It emerges from the foundational time-phase U(1) symmetry and is constructed to be operationally indistinguishable from standard Quantum Electrodynamics in the infrared regime (μ ≪ ω_c). This is achieved by enforcing Lorentz invariance on the Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM), recovering the standard renormalization group flow, and specifying finite, gauge-invariant matching conditions at the ω_c scale.

          Conduct precision measurements of canonical QED observables (e.g., lepton g-2, Lamb shift, running of α, photon dispersion/birefringence in vacuum). Compare results against Standard Model QED predictions. The "measurement" of the limit's validity is the continued absence of statistically significant deviations below the ω_c scale.

# Time-first QED limit

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Time-first QED limit is the effective field theory that describes the electromagnetic interaction below the coherence barrier frequency (ω_c ≈ 10²³ s⁻¹). It emerges from the foundational time-phase U(1) symmetry and is constructed to be operationally indistinguishable from standard Quantum Electrodynamics in the infrared regime (μ ≪ ω_c). This is achieved by enforcing Lorentz invariance on the Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM), recovering the standard renormalization group flow, and specifying finite, gauge-invariant matching conditions at the ω_c scale.

## EFT-First Summary
In the low-energy regime (μ ≪ ω_c), this framework is designed to be operationally identical to Standard Model Quantum Electrodynamics (SM-QED). Its Lagrangian, symmetries (Lorentz, Gauge), and renormalization group equations match SM-QED, ensuring that it reproduces all existing high-precision experimental results. It serves as the IR-safe foundation upon which the new physics of the Pirouette Framework is built.
