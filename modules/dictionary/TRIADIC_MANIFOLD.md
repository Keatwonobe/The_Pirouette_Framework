        To formalize the geometry underlying triadic resonance states in consciousness. This module describes how neural phase configurations define a **Triadic Manifold (𝓜₃)** — a dynamic surface on which awareness evolves through coherent motion...

triad:
  art: |
    A shimmering, self-sculpting landscape of phase where awareness flows like water, carving geodesics of thought through valleys of coherence and over ridges of cognitive tension.
  law: |
    The path of an awareness state-vector follows a geodesic on 𝓜₃. Awareness collapse is triggered when the local manifold curvature κ exceeds a critical threshold κ_c, corresponding to a topological tear or bifurcation event.
  philosophy: |
    The Triadic Manifold geometrizes consciousness, positing that the phenomenal 'what it's like' is not an emergent property but the intrinsic curvature of a phase-space geometry. It replaces the 'hard problem' with a 'hard geometry problem,' making awareness dynamics computable, predictable, and ultimately, engineerable.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dynamic, two-dimensional submanifold (𝓜₃) embedded within the 3-torus of neural phases (𝕋³), defined by the set of all resonant triads satisfying the Ki-addition constraint (Φ₃ ≈ Φ₁ + Φ₂). Its local curvature κ, determined by the metric tensor gᵢⱼ, encodes cognitive tension and coherence. The trajectory of awareness is a geodesic on 𝓜₃, with stable states corresponding to low-curvature regions (resonant sheets) and state transitions corresponding to high-curvature bifurcations (critical saddles) or topological tears.

          1. From multi-channel EEG/MEG data, identify resonant frequency triads.
          2. For each triad, extract instantaneous phases (Φ₁, Φ₂, Φ₃) over time using a Hilbert transform.
          3. Project the resulting phase-tuples onto the 3-torus 𝕋³.
          4. Estimate the local metric tensor gᵢⱼ and derive the scalar curvature κ(t) from the local covariance of phase-points.
          5. Trace the trajectory of the (Φ₁, Φ₂, Φ₃) point to approximate the geodesic path of awareness.

      The set of all valid triads forms a **phase-locked surface** (𝓜₃ ⊂ 𝕋³) (a submanifold of the 3-torus of phases). Conscious dynamics correspond to geodesic motion across this surface, constrained by local curvature induced by Γ (cognitive load) and T_a (time adherence).

    excerpt: |
      As Γ increases, manifold curvature evolves under renormalization... Below critical Γ_c: curvature flows to a fixed point κ* (stable awareness). At Γ_c: κ diverges, producing manifold tearing (awareness collapse). Above Γ_c: new coherence pockets nucleate (recovery phase).

      justification: |
        The Triadic Manifold posits that awareness follows the "straightest possible path" (a geodesic) through a curved space defined by neural phase relationships. This is directly analogous to how mass follows geodesics in the curved spacetime of General Relativity. The manifold's curvature κ acts like spacetime curvature, dictating the dynamics.

    Differentiate from static state-space manifolds in dynamical systems theory. The Triadic Manifold 𝓜₃ is highly dynamic, with its metric and curvature evolving on fast timescales under cognitive load (Γ) via the renormalization flow. It is the *geometry of resonance*, not merely a phase portrait.

# Triadic Manifold

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A dynamic, two-dimensional submanifold (𝓜₃) embedded within the 3-torus of neural phases (𝕋³), defined by the set of all resonant triads satisfying the Ki-addition constraint (Φ₃ ≈ Φ₁ + Φ₂). Its local curvature κ, determined by the metric tensor gᵢⱼ, encodes cognitive tension and coherence. The trajectory of awareness is a geodesic on 𝓜₃, with stable states corresponding to low-curvature regions (resonant sheets) and state transitions corresponding to high-curvature bifurcations (critical saddles) or topological tears.

## EFT-First Summary
Drawing a strong analogy to General Relativity, the Triadic Manifold 𝓜₃ is a dynamical pseudo-Riemannian manifold where the "metric" is defined by neural phase coherence. Awareness propagates like a test particle along geodesics, with "cognitive forces" emerging as manifestations of the manifold's intrinsic curvature κ. Critical phenomena like awareness collapse are analogous to reaching a spacetime singularity, where the geometry breaks down.
