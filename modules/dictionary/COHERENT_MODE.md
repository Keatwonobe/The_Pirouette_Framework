    The stable notes in a system's potential songbook; the quiet valleys in a landscape of possibility where a system can rest and find its form.
  law: |
    A Coherent Mode is a local maximum of systemic action (`‚à´ùìõ_p dt`) and a local minimum of potential energy, representing a dynamically stable, self-sustaining configuration. The count of such modes (`N`) is a primary determinant of systemic resilience.
  philosophy: |
    Coherent Modes are the discrete 'answers' a system can give to the question of its own existence. By understanding them not as destinations but as available states of being, a Weaver can architect resilience by shaping the *number* of choices, rather than forcing a single one.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable, self-sustaining resonant state within a system's coherence manifold where it can temporarily reside. Characterized as a local maximum of the system's action integral, a Coherent Mode represents a dynamically accessible basin of attraction. The total number of these modes (`N`) determines the system's topological irreducibility and its resilience to harmonic fracture under Temporal Pressure (`Œì`), as described by the Prime Resonance Principle.

          1. Define the system's state variables to establish the coherence manifold (state space).
          2. Apply systemic perturbations (e.g., noise injection, parameter sweeps) to drive the system across the manifold.
          3. Use clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN) on the resulting time-series data or use energy minimization techniques to identify local minima in the system's potential energy landscape.
          4. Enumerate the distinct, stable basins of attraction to determine the Mode Number (`N`).
        expected_signals: [Clear clustering of state vectors into discrete regions, periods of stability in time-series data punctuated by sharp state transitions.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking transient or metastable states for true coherent modes, insufficient exploration of the state space leading to an undercount of `N`.]

    excerpt: |
      The foundational shift is from a static to a dynamic ontology. The old framework spoke of "attractors" as destinations. We now understand them as stable, self-sustaining patterns of coherence... A **system** is a coherence manifold, a landscape of possibilities. A **Coherent Mode** (or **Coherence Well**) is a valley or basin in that landscape‚Äîa stable `Ki` resonance where the system can temporarily reside.
  - module: DOMA-111
    excerpt: |
      The Lagrangian describes the path of a system *within* a given coherence manifold. The Prime Resonance Principle describes the stability of the manifold *itself*. The coherence wells are locations on the manifold representing local maxima of the system's action (`‚à´ùìõ_p dt`). The Coherence Integrity metric, `Œõ(N)`, is a statement about the *topology of this solution space*.

        e.g., d**x**/dt = f(**x**), where **x** is a state vector. A Coherent Mode corresponds to a stable solution **x*** where f(**x***) = 0 or f(**x**(t)) is periodic.
      justification: |
        A Coherent Mode is the Pirouette equivalent of an attractor in a dynamical system's phase space. It represents a region to which system trajectories converge and remain, corresponding to a stable equilibrium or periodic state. The "coherence well" is directly analogous to a basin of attraction.

      justification: |
        Coherent modes are analogous to the discrete, stable energy eigenstates of a quantum system. Transitions between modes are like quantum jumps, and the 'coherence well' is conceptually similar to a potential well in which a particle can be trapped. This mapping is metaphorical but useful for intuition.

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol `Ki` is a homophone for "key" and is used in other contexts (e.g., martial arts, Japanese culture) to mean "life force" or "energy". The Pirouette usage is distinct and refers to a specific configurational state.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'coherence' as a wave property (phase alignment). A Coherent Mode is a *state* of systemic stability, not a measure of wave-like phase lock, though internal phase alignment may be a *feature* of the mode itself. Focus on the mode as a stable configuration, an "attractor," rather than as a property of waves.

# Coherent Mode

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A stable, self-sustaining resonant state within a system's coherence manifold where it can temporarily reside. Characterized as a local maximum of the system's action integral, a Coherent Mode represents a dynamically accessible basin of attraction. The total number of these modes (`N`) determines the system's topological irreducibility and its resilience to harmonic fracture under Temporal Pressure (`Œì`), as described by the Prime Resonance Principle.

## EFT-First Summary
A Coherent Mode is conceptually and operationally mapped to an **attractor** in the mathematical field of dynamical systems. It is a stable state (like a fixed point or limit cycle) in the system's phase space, representing a persistent configuration or pattern of behavior. The "coherence well" is its basin of attraction. The Prime Resonance Principle extends this by positing that the resilience of the entire system depends on the number-theoretic properties (specifically, primality) of the total count of these attractors.
