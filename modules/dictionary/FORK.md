    From one path, two futures bloom. A single thread divides at the loom of consequence, weaving distinct realities from a shared past.
  law: |
    A Ki-pattern `Ki` undergoes a Fork (‚ëÇ) into sub-patterns `Ki‚ÇÅ` and `Ki‚ÇÇ` if and only if the resulting sub-patterns are individually stable (satisfy `‚à´ùìõ_p dt = nƒß_p`) and mutually orthogonal (`<Ki‚ÇÅ|Ki‚ÇÇ> = 0`). The total coherence is partitioned, such that `K_œÑ(Ki) ‚â• K_œÑ(Ki‚ÇÅ) + K_œÑ(Ki‚ÇÇ)`.
  philosophy: |
    The Fork is the mechanism by which the universe introduces novelty and complexity. It is the geometric basis for decision, differentiation, and the branching of causal histories, ensuring that a single coherent state can explore multiple evolutionary pathways without violating fundamental conservation laws.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Fork is a quantized resonant geometry wherein a single, coherent Ki pattern divides into two or more distinct, self-sustaining, and mutually orthogonal sub-patterns. This controlled schism occurs along a pre-existing or newly formed Wound Channel (CORE-011), preserving the system's topological integrity while enabling the differentiation of its future state vector. The action of a Fork is to *differentiate*, creating multiple distinct causal paths from a single history.

          Map a system's Ki resonance modes over a short time interval using a non-invasive probe. A Fork is identified when a single, stable resonance peak at time `t‚ÇÄ` splits into two distinct, stable, non-interfering peaks at `t‚ÇÅ`. Orthogonality is confirmed by a zero cross-correlation between the daughter signals.

        In MWI, interaction with an environment causes a system's wavefunction to decohere into non-interacting branches, each representing a distinct outcome. This maps directly to the Fork's role in creating distinct, orthogonal sub-patterns (`|œà·µ¢‚ü©`) that represent separate paths forward from a single history. The orthogonality of the environmental states `|E·µ¢‚ü©` enforces the separation.

        SSB describes a system in a symmetric state transitioning to one of several degenerate, lower-energy vacuum states, breaking the initial symmetry. This is analogous to a Fork, where a single coherent state transitions into one of two or more distinct, stable sub-patterns, effectively choosing a branch in its state space.

      rationale: The language of "creating distinct paths forward from a single history" and the strict requirement for orthogonality of the resulting sub-patterns is an extremely strong parallel to the branching structure induced by decoherence in the MWI formulation of quantum mechanics.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinct from the `fork()` process in computing, a Pirouette Fork is not a simple duplication of state. It is a geometric partitioning of a single Ki pattern into two new, distinct, and orthogonal patterns whose combined coherence is less than or equal to the parent's. It is a differentiation, not a copy.

# Fork

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Fork is a quantized resonant geometry wherein a single, coherent Ki pattern divides into two or more distinct, self-sustaining, and mutually orthogonal sub-patterns. This controlled schism occurs along a pre-existing or newly formed Wound Channel (CORE-011), preserving the system's topological integrity while enabling the differentiation of its future state vector. The action of a Fork is to *differentiate*, creating multiple distinct causal paths from a single history.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, a Fork resembles the branching of the universal wavefunction as described in the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics. A coherent quantum system, upon interaction with its environment, decoheres into multiple, non-interfering 'worlds' or outcomes. Similarly, a Fork divides a Ki pattern into orthogonal sub-realities that evolve independently, providing a geometric basis for the emergence of a multiverse-like structure from a single causal history. This process is the fundamental mechanism of differentiation in the Pirouette Framework.
