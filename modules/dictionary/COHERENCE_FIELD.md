          The properties of the Coherence Field are not measured directly but are inferred from the behavior of the topological solitons it supports. Precision measurements of fermionic properties, such as the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) or spin statistics, provide quantitative tests of the field's posited geometric structure.

      The Pirouette Lagrangian does not describe the electron itself, but the underlying coherence field (T_a). The electron is a stable, two-cycle topological "knot" in this field. This two-cycle nature is the geometric origin of its fermionic properties and, crucially, its magnetic moment.

      The tiny deviation from 2 arises from this helical resonance interacting with its own "wake" or "echo" in the coherence manifold. This is the electron being influenced by the ghost of its own immediate past.

        The Coherence Field serves as the fundamental substrate from which particle properties and interactions emerge. This plays a functionally analogous role to the Standard Model's quantum vacuum, which is populated by virtual particle fluctuations that mediate interactions. The Pirouette Framework replaces the statistical "foam" with a deterministic geometric manifold.

# Coherence Field

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The fundamental field T_a whose dynamics are described by the Pirouette Lagrangian. It is the medium in which elementary particles exist as stable, self-perpetuating topological resonances (solitons or "knots"). Fermions, like the electron, are two-cycle helical resonances in T_a, a topology which is the origin of spin-1/2 properties and a baseline g-factor of g=2.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Field is the Pirouette Framework's conceptual analogue to the Standard Model's quantum vacuum. Instead of a "foam" of virtual particle fluctuations, it proposes a deterministic geometric manifold whose topological properties give rise to particle characteristics. Effects like the electron's anomalous magnetic moment, which in QED arise from loop corrections involving virtual particles, are modeled in Pirouette as a particle-soliton interacting with the "echo" of its own resonance within the Coherence Field.
