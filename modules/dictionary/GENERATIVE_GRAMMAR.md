  art: |
    The universe does not invent new laws for the termite mound and the galaxy; it whispers the same command at every scale. A single artist's signature is written in lightning, river, and neuron.
  law: |
    A system's structure is governed by a scale-invariant set of rules. The optimal solution for coherence at one scale is echoed at adjacent scales, differing only in temporal frequency and spatial amplitude, and can be quantified by its complexity, inter-scale fidelity, and generative rhythm.
  philosophy: |
    The world is not a collection of disparate problems but a unified system governed by a single, beautiful logic. To understand the grammar of growth is to realize that in learning to weave a single thread, you have learned the secret to the entire tapestry.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental set of rules, logic, and temporal rhythms that govern a system's growth and structural development. This grammar is revealed by observing the scale-invariant, self-similar patterns (fractals) that trace the system's geodesic—its path of maximum coherence as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian. It is the 'why' behind the 'what' of complex forms.
operational_definition:
  units: The Grammar itself is an abstract set of rules (dimensionless). Its measurable signatures have the following units: D_f (dimensionless), T_a_scale (dimensionless ratio), ω_g (T⁻¹).
  symbol_table:
    - name: D_f
      meaning: Coherence Complexity (Fractal Dimension). Measures how effectively the grammar fills its possibility space to create a resilient structure.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "[1, 3] for structures in 3D space"
    - name: T_a_scale
      meaning: Inter-Scale Coherence. Measures the fidelity of the generative pattern across scales; a signal-to-noise ratio of the rule's application.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "[0, 1]"
    - name: ω_g
      meaning: Generative Rhythm. The fundamental frequency or "beat" of the recursive process, defining the tempo of growth and reinforcement.
      dimensions: T⁻¹
      default_range: contextual

    procedures:
      - name: Fractal Signature Analysis
        outline: |
          1.  Isolate a data series or spatial structure exhibiting potential self-similarity.
          2.  Apply computational methods to quantify the three signatures. Use Box-Counting or correlation dimension for `D_f`. Use Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM) to assess `T_a_scale` by analyzing the scaling of wavelet coefficients. Use Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) or Fourier analysis to extract the dominant `ω_g`.
          3.  Correlate the measured signatures with the system's environmental pressure (`Γ`) to validate the generative equation (`D_f ≈ 1 + C * ...`).

    excerpt: |
      A fractal is not a shape; it is the physical trace of a **scale-invariant geodesic**—the universe's preferred solution for maximizing coherence in systems that must exist across a wide range of scales. These patterns are the signature of a single artist, written in the lightning, the river, and the neuron, revealing a fundamental grammar for growth and complexity.
  - module: DOMA-136
    excerpt: |
      A system adopts this structure not for aesthetic reasons, but because this resonant hierarchy *is* the most energetically efficient and resilient solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation, solved everywhere, all at once. The temporal expression of the Fractal Geodesic is recursion—the act of a system iteratively following its own echo.

        RG describes how a physical theory's parameters (g) change with energy scale (μ). The Pirouette Generative Grammar is conceptually homologous to the beta functions (β) that define this flow. A high Inter-Scale Coherence (`T_a_scale` → 1) is analogous to an RG flow approaching a fixed point, where the theory becomes scale-invariant (a Conformal Field Theory).

      justification: |
        L-systems are a formal grammar that uses a small set of recursive rules (productions) to generate complex, often fractal, structures. This provides a direct mathematical model for a Generative Grammar, where the axiom and production rules encode the `T_a_scale` and `ω_g` that result in a structure with a specific `D_f`.

  adopted:
    - target: Renormalization Group (RG) Flow
      rationale: While L-systems are an excellent mathematical model, the RG flow from Effective Field Theory (EFT) captures the deeper physical principle of how a system's descriptive laws change with scale, which is central to the Pirouette Framework's emphasis on dynamics over static geometry. The grammar is the *physics* of the flow, not just the mathematical ruleset.

      falsifier: "Observation of multiple systems where high `T_a_scale` and `ω_g` consistently produce low-complexity structures (`D_f` approaching 1), or where complexity is entirely uncorrelated with these parameters, would falsify the proposed relationship."

  disambiguation: |
    The term "Generative Grammar" is famously used in linguistics, as pioneered by Noam Chomsky, to describe the rules of natural language syntax. The Pirouette Framework's usage is distinct: it refers to the fundamental rules governing physical *form*, *growth*, and *pattern* in dynamical systems across scales. It is a grammar of geometry and time, not of sentences.

# Generative Grammar

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The fundamental set of rules, logic, and temporal rhythms that govern a system's growth and structural development. This grammar is revealed by observing the scale-invariant, self-similar patterns (fractals) that trace the system's geodesic—its path of maximum coherence as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian. It is the 'why' behind the 'what' of complex forms.

## EFT-First Summary
The Generative Grammar is conceptually homologous to the beta functions defining a Renormalization Group (RG) flow in Effective Field Theory. It describes the rules by which a system's descriptive parameters evolve with observational scale. A highly coherent grammar (`T_a_scale` → 1) corresponds to an RG flow approaching a fixed point, yielding a scale-invariant system analogous to a Conformal Field Theory. The grammar's signatures—complexity (`D_f`), coherence (`T_a_scale`), and rhythm (`ω_g`)—are thus operational measures of how a system behaves under a change of scale.
