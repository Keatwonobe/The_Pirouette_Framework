        This is a living library of the universe's known survival strategies. It provides the candidate geometries for the projection protocol, offering a vocabulary of coherent forms.

  art: |
    A bestiary of resilience; the known songs sung by systems that have refused to fall silent in the face of the storm.
  law: |
    For any given Temporal Pressure (Γ), there exists a finite set of candidate Ki Archetypes within the library that can produce a maximally coherent projection (T_a) from observational data.
  philosophy: |
    The universe is not infinitely creative in its solutions for persistence. This library embodies the Principle of Coherent Correspondence by cataloging recurring, successful strategies for existence, making the search for a system's core identity a tractable problem of pattern matching rather than an infinite search.
pirouette_definition: |
  A curated, extensible collection of mathematical and geometric forms (archetypes) representing known stable solutions to the Pirouette Lagrangian under various environmental pressures (Γ). The library serves as the set of candidate hypotheses for a system's coherent identity (Ki) within the Resonance Lens protocol, enabling the computational extraction of a system's core dynamics from high-dimensional data.

    procedures:
      - name: Archetype Resonance Fitting
        outline: |
          1. Select a candidate archetype from the library based on the characterized environmental pressure (Γ) and expected phase complexity (P).
          2. Use a Projection Operator to computationally fit the observational data stream to the chosen archetype's form.
          3. Calculate the Temporal Coherence (T_a) of the resulting projection.
          4. Iterate through other plausible archetypes, selecting the one that yields the highest, most stable T_a as the system's identified Ki pattern.
        expected_signals: [A high, stable T_a value for the correctly matched archetype; low or unstable T_a for mismatched archetypes.]
        pitfalls: [Selecting an inappropriate archetype due to mischaracterization of Γ, overfitting data to a complex archetype when a simpler one suffices.]

      equation_hint: |
        ẋ = f(x) → {x₀, x₁, ...} where x_i are attractors
      justification: |
        The Ki Archetypes are described as stable, resonant solutions that systems settle into. This is conceptually identical to the definition of attractors in dynamical systems theory, which are the states or trajectories that a system evolves towards over time. The library is a catalog of these known stable forms.

        f(x) ≈ Σ c_i * B_i(x), where B_i ∈ L_Ki
      justification: |
        Operationally, the Resonance Lens protocol uses the library as a set of candidate models or basis functions to fit to data. The process of selecting the archetype that best "explains" the data is analogous to model selection in machine learning or finding the optimal basis to represent a signal.

  collisions: [Ki (Eastern philosophy), Archetype (Jungian psychology)]
  disambiguation: |
    While 'Ki' intentionally evokes the concept of a vital, organizing principle, in the Pirouette Framework it refers specifically to a system's measurable, coherent identity or pattern. Similarly, 'Archetype' is used in its original sense of a primitive, universal pattern, not strictly in the Jungian psychological sense, though conceptual parallels exist.
