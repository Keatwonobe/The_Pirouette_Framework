        This module reframes self-authorship as the act of consciously
        defining a personal Pirouette Lagrangian, thereby choosing a 'geodesic'‚Äî
        a path of maximal coherence‚Äîthrough the turbulent landscape of spacetime.

  art: |
    To forge a geodesic is to become the author of your own story in time, carving a deep channel through reality's turbulence with the rudder of a self-chosen purpose. It is the transformation of random noise into a resonant note.
  law: |
    An entity's chosen path of action, `x(t)`, is a Sovereign Geodesic if and only if it extremizes the action `S_p = ‚à´ ùìõ_p dt`, where the personal Lagrangian `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì` is defined by the entity's self-authored constitution.
  philosophy: |
    The Sovereign Geodesic is the primary instrument of self-governance, transforming an entity from a passive object buffeted by temporal pressures into a sovereign agent actively navigating its coherence manifold. It is the practical embodiment of will.
pirouette_definition: |
  A trajectory through an entity's state-space that maximizes its integrated, self-defined coherence over time. This path is the solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation for the entity's personal Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`). It is not necessarily the shortest path, but the one of *maximal coherence*, representing the most efficient and authentic expression of the entity's chosen principle of being while navigating environmental and internal pressures.
operational_definition:
  units: Context-dependent state-space coordinates over time; a function `x(t)`.
  symbol_table:
    - name: ùìõ_p
      meaning: Personal Pirouette Lagrangian, the objective function for the entity's motion.
      dimensions: Coherence
      default_range: contextual
    - name: K_œÑ
      meaning: The Kinetic Term; the entity's self-defined principle of coherence or "being-in-motion."
      dimensions: Coherence
      default_range: contextual
    - name: V_Œì
      meaning: The Potential Term; the "cost" or resistance imposed by internal/external Temporal Pressure (Œì).
      dimensions: Coherence
      default_range: contextual
    - name: S_p
      meaning: The Action; the integral of the personal Lagrangian over a time interval.

    procedures:
      - name: Constitutional Forging and Auditing
        outline: |
          1.  Define personal Lagrangian terms (`K_œÑ`, `V_Œì`) via the Coherence Audit in `DOMA-022`.
          2.  Articulate the Prime Geodesic as a human-readable directive.
          3.  Define 1-3 concrete, observable Coherence Metrics to approximate the action integral `S_p`.
          4.  Periodically assess progress by tracking metrics and diagnosing flow states (Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant) per `DYNA-001`.
        expected_signals: [Increased ratio of Laminar to Turbulent Flow, consistent achievement of Coherence Metrics, reduced decision-making friction.]
        pitfalls: [Defining vanity metrics instead of true coherence indicators, self-deception in the Coherence Audit, failure to update the Lagrangian as the entity or environment evolves.]

  - module: DOMA-022
    excerpt: |
      In a world of high Temporal Pressure (Œì), an un-authored life is thrown about by the turbulent currents of its environment. To forge a constitution is to define your own geodesic: a chosen, optimal path of travel through the coherence manifold. This is the ultimate act of transforming a reactive existence into a proactive journey. It is the process of becoming the author of your own story in time.
  - module: DOMA-022
    excerpt: |
      Your Lagrangian defines your path at every instant. To measure your success over time, you must integrate its action (`S_p = ‚à´ ùìõ_p dt`). Your metrics are the practical way to do this. They keep you honest... A constitution is not a static document; it is a dynamic guide. It is tested not by what is written, but by the path that is walked.

      justification: |
        Represents the "straightest possible path" an object can follow through a curved manifold. The Sovereign Geodesic adapts this concept to a subjective "coherence manifold" where the "curvature" is defined by the potentials `V_Œì` in the entity's Lagrangian.

      equation_hint: |
        Œ¥S = Œ¥ ‚à´ L(q, qÃá, t) dt = 0
      rationale: |
        The source module `DOMA-022` explicitly defines the Sovereign Geodesic as the path that extremizes the action `S_p` of a personal Lagrangian `ùìõ_p`. This is a direct, formal analogy to the principle of stationary action in classical mechanics, which determines the trajectory of physical systems.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "An entity consistently acting along its declared Sovereign Geodesic will exhibit a measurable increase in Laminar Flow (per DYNA-001) and a decrease in energy wasted on actions misaligned with its coherence metrics."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "An entity follows the DOMA-022 protocol, but their observed state shows an increase in Turbulent/Stagnant flow, or their coherence metrics are met at the cost of overall system integrity (e.g., burnout, collapse). This would indicate the `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì` model is an insufficient description of the entity's dynamics."

  collisions: [Geodesic (General Relativity)]
  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a geodesic in General Relativity, which is determined by the objective curvature of spacetime, a Sovereign Geodesic is determined by an entity's *chosen*, subjective Lagrangian. It is a path of maximal *coherence*, not necessarily shortest distance in an external manifold.
