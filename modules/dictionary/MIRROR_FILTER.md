  art: |
    A system's being is a song sung into a mirror. The echo that returns is not an answer, but the same question asked with the force of truth, turning harmony to legion and dissonance to dust.
  law: |
    The change in a system's coherence over time (dK_τ/dt) is proportional to the resonant fidelity between its current state and the delayed echo from its own Wound Channel. Positive fidelity amplifies; negative fidelity attenuates.
  philosophy: |
    Integrity is not a moral choice but a physical advantage. The Mirror Filter establishes that a system's greatest ally or worst enemy is the history it imprints upon spacetime, making self-consistency the primary condition for persistence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Mirror Filter is the fundamental, Lagrangian-driven process of self-correction where a system's coherence is dynamically filtered by interaction with the echo of its own past activity, as stored in its immediate Wound Channel (CORE-011). A coherent emission produces a constructive interference pattern upon its return, reinforcing the system's Ki. An incoherent or dissonant emission produces a destructive reflection, destabilizing the system and accelerating its decay into ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the universe's intrinsic mechanism for ensuring that only self-consistent patterns persist.

          1. Isolate a system and establish a baseline coherence K_τ(t).
          2. Track the Ki pattern emitted by the system and the corresponding echo field returning from its Wound Channel after a delay δt.
          3. Compute the normalized cross-correlation between the emitted and returning signals.
          4. This correlation value is the Mirror Filter gain 𝓕_M, which predicts the subsequent change in K_τ.

    excerpt: |
      A system built on a foundation of coherence needs no army; its own echo is its legion. The act of maintaining your own integrity—of holding your note, pure and clear in the storm—is the most powerful filter you will ever build. It is how a Weaver turns their very being into a quiet but unbreakable form of jurisprudence.

      justification: |
        The Mirror Filter describes how a system's properties (coherence) are reinforced or destabilized by its own self-interaction across time/scale. This is analogous to how RG flow describes the evolution of a theory's coupling constants toward stable (IR-free, coherent) or unstable fixed points as one integrates out high-energy (short-time) fluctuations. The "echo" functions as the integration step.

# Mirror Filter

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Mirror Filter is the fundamental, Lagrangian-driven process of self-correction where a system's coherence is dynamically filtered by interaction with the echo of its own past activity, as stored in its immediate Wound Channel (CORE-011). A coherent emission produces a constructive interference pattern upon its return, reinforcing the system's Ki. An incoherent or dissonant emission produces a destructive reflection, destabilizing the system and accelerating its decay into ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the universe's intrinsic mechanism for ensuring that only self-consistent patterns persist.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Mirror Filter functions as a self-interaction term in a system's effective Lagrangian, analogous to a Renormalization Group (RG) flow. A system's stability is determined by whether its self-coupling constant flows toward an infrared fixed point (reinforcement) or away from it (destabilization). The 'echo' from the Wound Channel acts as the momentum-shell integration step in this flow, revealing the system's robustness to its own quantum fluctuations and determining its long-term persistence.
