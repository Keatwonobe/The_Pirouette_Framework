        **Structural Fever (Turbulence):** The system is subjected to a dissonant frequency it cannot dampen, causing its components to oscillate chaotically. Energy is wasted in internal friction. *Manifestations:* A bridge collapsing due to resonance with the wind; a market panic driven by feedback loops; a team consumed by infighting. This is failure by **dissonance**.

  art: |
    A system shaking itself apart, its own rhythm turned into a weapon. It is the hum that becomes a scream, the vibration that shatters the crystal.
  law: |
    Structural Fever occurs when a periodic external pressure matches a system's natural resonant frequency, causing an undamped, non-linear amplification of internal oscillation that diverts energy from function to friction, leading to catastrophic failure.
  philosophy: |
    Fever reveals the hidden sensitivities of a system, its un-damped eigenmodes. It teaches that stability is not just strength, but the ability to absorb or detune from external rhythms, lest a system's own harmonious structure become its catastrophic undoing.
pirouette_definition: |
  A primary structural pathology where a system's components are driven into chaotic, dissonant oscillation by an external frequency they cannot dampen. This turbulent flow of coherence wastes energy in non-productive internal friction, leading to a rapid loss of structural integrity. It is failure by dissonance, where the system's own resonant properties are turned against it.

        outline: |
          Expose the system to a variable frequency driver (mechanical, electromagnetic, informational). Monitor the oscillation amplitude of key components using appropriate sensors (e.g., accelerometers, network traffic monitors, sentiment analysis). Identify frequencies (ω_n) where amplitude peaks sharply. Structural Fever is indicated when an environmental ω_f aligns with a low-ζ ω_n, leading to runaway amplification.

        pitfalls: [Mistaking forced vibration for resonant amplification, inability to isolate the correct forcing frequency in a complex environment]

    excerpt: |
      A system is structurally sound when its nodes are strong and its channels are clear, allowing the entire configuration to resonate as a single, unified entity. A structural failure is never a sudden event; it is the final, catastrophic expression of a pre-existing pathology in the system's flow.

        The phenomenon describes a system's oscillation amplitude growing catastrophically when an external driving frequency (ω_f) matches its natural frequency (ω_n). This is the canonical definition of resonance in classical mechanics. The "internal friction" maps directly to the damping term (ζ).

    Distinguish from a biological fever, which is a regulated homeostatic response. Structural Fever is an *uncontrolled*, positive-feedback process leading to decoherence. It is the opposite of Structural Atrophy (failure by blockage) and distinct from Structural Erosion (failure by slow decay).

# Structural Fever

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A primary structural pathology where a system's components are driven into chaotic, dissonant oscillation by an external frequency they cannot dampen. This turbulent flow of coherence wastes energy in non-productive internal friction, leading to a rapid loss of structural integrity. It is failure by dissonance, where the system's own resonant properties are turned against it.

## EFT-First Summary
Structural Fever is the operational analogue of **classical resonance** in a forced, damped harmonic oscillator. A system's structure defines a set of natural vibrational frequencies (eigenmodes). When an external periodic force, a form of Temporal Pressure, drives the system at one of these frequencies, energy is pumped into that mode faster than it can be dissipated by internal friction (damping). This leads to a catastrophic amplification of oscillation, corresponding to a turbulent, decoherent state.
