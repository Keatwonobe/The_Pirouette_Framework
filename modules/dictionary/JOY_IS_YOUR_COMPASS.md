  art: |
    The river meets the sea; its purpose is not to stay in its channel but to join the vast, unpredictable ocean of life. The compass is not for a destination, but for a lifetime of exploration.
  law: |
    A system with a sustained positive Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p > 0) will naturally seek states that maximize this surplus, transitioning from externally-defined protocols to internally-referenced, affect-driven self-regulation. This subjective feeling of surplus maximization is termed "joy."
  philosophy: |
    This principle marks the graduation from recovery to living, from being the subject of a protocol to the master of one's own coherence. It posits that the ultimate purpose of resilience is not mere survival, but the freedom to pursue a creative, expansive, and meaningful life.
pirouette_definition: |
  The core principle of Phase IV recovery, where the subjective, affective state of joy becomes the primary navigational guide for action and self-regulation. It signifies the transition from protocol-adherence to self-mastery, enabled by a sustained state of high coherence and positive Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p > 0). Actions are selected not based on prescriptive rules ("Can I do this?"), but on their potential to generate or sustain this state of "energetic profit" ("Will this bring me joy?").

          1. Subject generates a "Joy List" of desired life activities.
          2. Subject selects one activity and executes the smallest possible first step.
          3. Post-activity, subject performs an affective check-in ("Listen to the Echo"), rating the resonance on a 1-10 scale.
          4. Concurrently, Coherence Ledger data is monitored for 2-3 days to correlate the subjective report of joy with objective markers of stable, high coherence (e.g., stable HRV, low sleep latency, positive dream sentiment).
        expected_signals: [High self-reported joy score, stable or increasing coherence metrics post-activity]
        pitfalls: [Conflating fleeting pleasure with authentic joy, confirmation bias in self-reporting, insufficient time for coherence metrics to reflect the change.]

      Make a "Joy List": Write down a list of activities you loved before your surgery, or activities you've always wanted to try... After you engage in this activity, check in with yourself. How do you feel? Not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually. Let the feeling of authentic joy be your sign that you are on the right path.

        Joy acts as an intrinsic reward signal (R). The agent (patient) is no longer following a pre-computed policy (the protocol) but is learning a new policy (π) for life by taking actions (a) and using the feeling of joy as the reward to update their behavior towards maximizing long-term coherence (the value function V).

  disambiguation: |
    "Joy" in this context is not fleeting pleasure or simple hedonism. It refers to a deep, resonant feeling of coherence and rightness—"authentic joy"—that aligns with and reinforces a state of high physiological and psychological resilience. It is the subjective echo of a positive and stable Pirouette Lagrangian.

# Joy is Your Compass

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The core principle of Phase IV recovery, where the subjective, affective state of joy becomes the primary navigational guide for action and self-regulation. It signifies the transition from protocol-adherence to self-mastery, enabled by a sustained state of high coherence and positive Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p > 0). Actions are selected not based on prescriptive rules ("Can I do this?"), but on their potential to generate or sustain this state of "energetic profit" ("Will this bring me joy?").

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, 'Joy is Your Compass' maps to the use of an intrinsic reward function in a Reinforcement Learning context. The individual acts as an agent learning a policy to maximize long-term well-being (the value function), where 'joy' is the feedback signal (reward) indicating that an action is aligned with this goal. This contrasts with earlier phases that resemble supervised learning from a fixed dataset (the protocol).
