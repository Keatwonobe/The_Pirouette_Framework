    A memory of a journey, recorded as a twist in your own clock-hand. Charge is the number of turns you must make to come back to yourself after circling a defect in the world's time.
  law: |
    Parallel transport of a quantum state's phase frame around a closed loop in parameter space results in a holonomy \gamma_\mathcal{C} that must equal 2\pi n for an integer n. This condition quantizes any coupling constants appearing in the connection, such as electric charge.
  philosophy: |
    This transforms charge from an arbitrary coupling constant into a topological invariant. The discreteness of charge is not a fundamental axiom but an emergent consequence of requiring a consistent, single-valued description of a spinor defect's interaction with the U(1) time-phase medium.
pirouette_definition: |
  The total geometric phase, \gamma_\mathcal{C}, acquired by the time-phase frame of a Ki-defect spinor when parallel-transported along a closed loop \mathcal{C} in configuration space. It is the path integral of the composite Berry connection \mathcal{A} = (\partial_\mu\theta - qA_\mu)dx^\mu. The physical requirement that the final state be single-valued (e^{i\gamma_\mathcal{C}}=1) constrains the holonomy to integer multiples of 2\pi, which in turn quantizes the charge, q.

      The charge quantum q_0, fixed by the BERRY_HOLONOMY constraint in MATH-QED-003, is not a free parameter. Its squared value enters the fine-structure constant \alpha. The numerical value of \alpha is therefore a ratio of the temporal medium's connection stiffness (from MATH-QED-001) and the topological winding number of the elementary spinor defect.

        The Pirouette Berry Holonomy is a specific application of the general Berry Phase concept to the combined parameter space of the spinor's internal degrees of freedom and its position, coupled to the U(1) time-phase field. The composite connection \mathcal{A} is a specific instance of a Berry connection. The quantization condition is the standard result for non-trivial holonomy in a U(1) bundle.

# Berry Holonomy

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Berry Holonomy, \gamma_\mathcal{C}, is the total geometric phase acquired by the time-phase frame of a Ki-defect spinor when parallel-transported along a closed loop \mathcal{C} in configuration space. It is the path integral of the composite Berry connection \mathcal{A} = (\partial_\mu\theta - qA_\mu)dx^\mu. The physical requirement that the final state be single-valued (e^{i\gamma_\mathcal{C}}=1) constrains the holonomy to integer multiples of 2\pi, which in turn quantizes the charge, q.

## EFT-First Summary
The Berry Holonomy is a direct application of the standard quantum mechanical **Berry Phase** (or geometric phase). In this context, it arises when considering the state of a fermion (the Ki-defect spinor) whose internal phase clock is coupled to an external U(1) gauge field A_\mu. Transporting the fermion around a closed loop in space that encloses a magnetic flux results in a non-trivial phase shift. The requirement that the fermion's wavefunction be single-valued forces this phase to be a multiple of 2\pi, which is the physical origin of charge quantization in the framework. This phenomenon is experimentally verified in the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
