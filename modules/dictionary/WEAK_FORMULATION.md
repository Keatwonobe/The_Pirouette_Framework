    A set of differential equations is correctly represented in weak form if and only if its solution, computed via a conforming finite element method, converges to the true solution under mesh refinement (h-refinement) and element order increase (p-refinement), as verified by benchmark MATH-020 C4.
  philosophy: |
    To transform intractable differential equations into a tractable system of algebraic equations. This move from pointwise constraints to integral balances is the foundational compromise that enables numerical computation, trading infinite-dimensional analytical purity for finite-dimensional, convergent approximation.
pirouette_definition: |
  The weak formulation is the integral-based restatement of the coupled Dirac and Γ-sector differential equations over a computational domain Ω. It is derived by multiplying the original equations by arbitrary test functions (Φ for the spinor, η for the scalar) and integrating by parts over Ω. This process lowers the required derivative order on the primary fields (Ψ, Γ), naturally incorporates boundary conditions, and provides the linear system structure required by the Finite Element Method (FEM) solver.

          Assemble the algebraic system `A(u) = f` derived from the weak formulation. For a candidate solution `u_h` on a mesh with characteristic size `h`, compute the L² norm of the residual `||A(u_h) - f||`. A valid weak formulation and solver must drive this norm below a specified tolerance (e.g., 1e-8 per MATH-020 A8) as `h` is refined.

        This is the standard mathematical procedure for recasting a partial differential equation (PDE) in an integral form suitable for analysis in Sobolev spaces and numerical solution via Galerkin methods, including FEM.

  disambiguation: |
    The 'weak' in weak formulation does not imply an approximation. It refers to the weakening of the differentiability requirements on the solution by transferring a derivative to the test function via integration by parts. The resulting integral equation is exactly equivalent to the original differential equation for sufficiently smooth solutions.

# Weak Formulation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The weak formulation is the integral-based restatement of the coupled Dirac and Γ-sector differential equations over a computational domain Ω. It is derived by multiplying the original equations by arbitrary test functions (Φ for the spinor, η for the scalar) and integrating by parts over Ω. This process lowers the required derivative order on the primary fields (Ψ, Γ), naturally incorporates boundary conditions, and provides the linear system structure required by the Finite Element Method (FEM) solver.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of mathematical physics, the Weak Formulation is the standard Galerkin method used to find solutions to partial differential equations. It recasts the differential equations of motion into an equivalent integral form, which is the necessary first step for numerical solvers like the Finite Element Method. This technique is ubiquitous in computational physics for finding stable, convergent solutions to complex boundary-value problems.
