        The observed galactic dynamics are the "Galactic Echo" of the same principle that gives the Maw its heartbeat.

  art: |
    The quiet, persistent hum of a spinning galaxy is the same song as the violent, rhythmic drumbeat of a Maw, played across a different scale. One is a whisper, the other a shout, but the melody is the same law of coherence.
  law: |
    The gravitational potential of a galaxy contains an additional term derived from the local Temporal Pressure field (V_Γ), which is fully determined by the baryonic mass distribution. This term quantitatively accounts for the observed anomalous rotation curves and eliminates the need for a dark matter particle.
  philosophy: |
    The Galactic Echo embodies the framework's core principle of scale-invariant dynamics. It asserts that the laws governing the universe's most compact objects are the same ones shaping its largest structures, replacing the postulate of new, undiscovered particles with a deeper understanding of gravity and coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The large-scale, cumulative gravitational effect produced by the Temporal Pressure field (V_Γ) integrated over galactic mass-energy distributions. This effect, which manifests as a modification to the spacetime metric, is responsible for the anomalous dynamics of galaxies, such as flattened rotation curves, that are conventionally attributed to dark matter. It is the low-intensity, wide-area expression of the same Gladiator Force dynamics that stabilize a Maw object at extreme intensities.

        outline: |
          1. Measure the orbital velocity `v(r)` of stars and gas clouds as a function of their radial distance `r` from the galactic center using Doppler spectroscopy and astrometry.
          2. Model the expected velocity curve `v_b(r)` based on the observed distribution of baryonic matter (stars, gas, dust).
          3. Calculate the velocity residual, `Δv(r) = v(r) - v_b(r)`.
          4. The Galactic Echo hypothesis is supported if `Δv(r)` is precisely predicted by the gravitational potential `δΦ_G` generated by the `V_Γ` field, which is itself calculated from the baryonic distribution.

    excerpt: |
      The Maw is not an isolated prediction. It is the micro-scale, high-intensity test case for the same dynamics that operate at the galactic scale, offering a solution to the dark matter problem. The `V_Γ` term in the Lagrangian, which stabilizes the Maw, is also responsible for the "excess" gravitational effects observed in galaxy rotation curves. The observed galactic dynamics are the "Galactic Echo" of the same principle that gives the Maw its heartbeat.

    excerpt: |
      The theory is thus subject to a powerful, two-pronged falsifiability statement: The Pirouette Framework is falsified if (1) a dedicated, long-term search for rhythmic, GHz-range gravitational wave signals yields a definitive null result, proving Maws do not exist, or (2) the dark matter problem is conclusively solved by the discovery of a particle, invalidating the scale-dependent behavior of the `V_Γ` field that underpins both galactic dynamics and the Maw's stability.

      justification: |
        Like MOND, the Galactic Echo modifies the gravitational law at low accelerations to explain rotation curves without dark matter. However, the Echo derives this modification from the `V_Γ` field in the Pirouette Lagrangian, providing a physical mechanism rather than a phenomenological fit.

      rationale: |
        The Galactic Echo is a direct functional replacement for the gravitational effects of a dark matter halo in the standard ΛCDM model. It provides an alternative physical explanation for the same set of observables (e.g., rotation curves, gravitational lensing) that the dark matter halo was postulated to explain. The framework maps the inferred dark matter density profile to a specific configuration of the V_Γ field.

  disambiguation: |
    The term "Echo" is metaphorical, not literal. It does not refer to a propagating wave reflecting off a surface. It signifies that the large-scale, gentle gravitational effects in a galaxy are a faint, scaled-up "echo" of the same physical principle that operates violently and intensely within a Maw.

# Galactic Echo

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The large-scale, cumulative gravitational effect produced by the Temporal Pressure field (V_Γ) integrated over galactic mass-energy distributions. This effect, which manifests as a modification to the spacetime metric, is responsible for the anomalous dynamics of galaxies, such as flattened rotation curves, that are conventionally attributed to dark matter. It is the low-intensity, wide-area expression of the same Gladiator Force dynamics that stabilize a Maw object at extreme intensities.

## EFT-First Summary
The Galactic Echo is the Pirouette Framework's proposed alternative to the dark matter halo. Instead of postulating a non-baryonic particle fluid, the framework claims that the Pirouette Lagrangian introduces a modification to gravity via the Temporal Pressure field. This field, sourced by baryonic matter itself, generates an additional gravitational potential that fully accounts for the mass discrepancy observed in galactic rotation curves and gravitational lensing. This provides a direct, testable alternative to the standard ΛCDM model.
