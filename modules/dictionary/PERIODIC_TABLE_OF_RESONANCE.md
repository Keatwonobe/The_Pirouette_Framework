        A Prime Resonance is an irreducible, stable Ki pattern—a fundamental "verb" of existence. While countless composite patterns exist, they are all synthesized from these core archetypes. They are the natural "valleys" and stable orbits on the coherence manifold defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

    The universe does not build with bricks; it composes with notes. This is the musical scale of reality, the fundamental tones from which the symphony of existence is written.
  law: |
    All complex system behavior is a composition of a finite set of fundamental, dynamic Ki patterns called Prime Resonances. Any observed system's temporal signature can be decomposed into a superposition of these archetypal forms.
  philosophy: |
    This framework replaces a static, structural view of reality with a dynamic, process-oriented one. By classifying the fundamental "verbs" of existence, it provides a universal diagnostic language to analyze a system's harmony, health, and evolutionary path.
pirouette_definition: |
  The organizing framework that classifies the fundamental, irreducible, and stable Ki patterns (Prime Resonances) from which all complex system behavior is composed. It replaces the static 'periodic table of dimensions' with a dynamic, time-first model, mapping the most efficient and probable patterns of coherence—Vector, Orbit, Helix, and Braid—as they emerge as stable "valleys" on the manifold defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

        outline: |
          1. **Capture Temporal Signature:** Record a system's key dynamic variables over a sufficient time period to capture its characteristic behavior.
          2. **Harmonic Decomposition:** Apply spectral analysis (e.g., Fourier Transform) to the time-series data to decompose the complex signal into its constituent fundamental frequencies and their amplitudes.
          3. **Archetype Mapping:** Map the dominant, stable frequencies and their phase relationships to the geometric archetypes of the Prime Resonances. A single strong peak suggests an Orbit; a slowly drifting peak suggests a Helix; two or more phase-locked peaks suggest a Braid.
          4. **Harmony Assessment:** Quantify the system's coherence by the signal-to-noise ratio of its Resonant Signature. A clear, stable signature with well-defined peaks indicates high harmony; a noisy, indistinct, or rapidly changing spectrum indicates dissonance.
        expected_signals: [Discrete peaks in the frequency domain, stable phase relationships between dominant frequencies]
        pitfalls: [Insufficient sampling duration leading to missed low-frequency dynamics, signal aliasing from low sample rates, misinterpreting transient noise as a stable resonance]

    excerpt: |
      Complex systems are rarely a single, pure note; they are chords. Their Ki pattern is an Alchemical Union (CORE-012) of multiple Prime Resonances. A system's nature is defined by its Resonant Signature—the set of its constituent prime patterns... The stability of such a composite system depends on the Harmony between its constituent resonances.
  - module: DOMA-124
    excerpt: |
      The Prime Resonances are not arbitrary classifications. They are direct consequences of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). They represent the deepest and most stable "valleys" on the coherence manifold defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian. A system does not choose an archetype; it falls into the resonant pattern that offers the path of maximal coherence for the lowest energetic cost.

      justification: |
        In classical mechanics, any complex oscillation of a system near equilibrium can be decomposed into a superposition of simple harmonic motions called normal modes. The Resonant Analysis protocol is a direct analog, identifying the fundamental "modes" (Prime Resonances) that constitute a system's complex dynamic behavior.

      justification: |
        The diagnostic protocol for identifying a Resonant Signature is explicitly based on harmonic decomposition, the mathematical process of representing a function or signal as a sum of simpler sinusoidal functions. The Prime Resonances are the archetypal interpretations of the fundamental components revealed by this analysis.

  collisions: [Periodic Table of Elements (Chemistry)]
  disambiguation: |
    The name is an intentional analogy to the chemical periodic table, which classifies fundamental, recurring elements from which complex matter is built. Here, the "elements" are not static atoms but dynamic, recurring patterns of flow (resonances). The "periodicity" refers to the recurrence of these fundamental archetypes across all scales and domains.
