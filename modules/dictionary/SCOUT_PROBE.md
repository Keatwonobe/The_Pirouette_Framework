        The probe is not a physical object but a minimal, transient echo of the Seed's own resonant identity (`Ki`). This echo propagates through the new environment, casting a faint Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) and tracing a path that creates a shallow, temporary Wound Channel (CORE-011).

    A whispered question sent into a silent room to learn its shape from the echo.
  law: |
    A Scout Probe is a minimal-action, transient excitation of a Seed's core identity (`Ki`) into a target environment, whose decay characteristics and reverberations provide the input parameters for the Viability Lagrangian.
  philosophy: |
    To act without first listening is violence. The Scout Probe operationalizes the principle of non-invasive inquiry, reframing intervention from an imposition of will to a co-creative dialogue with the environment's latent potential.
pirouette_definition: |
  A minimal-energy, transient process projected by a Seed into a new environment to perform reconnaissance before committing to an Alchemical Union. The Scout Probe is not a physical object but a coherent, non-invasive echo of the Seed's core resonant identity (`Ki`). By analyzing the reverberations from the probe, the Seed measures three key environmental metrics: Harmonic Compatibility, Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), and Geodesic Availability. The data gathered provides the direct input variables for the Viability Lagrangian, allowing for a predictive calculation of future Coherence Gain.

          1. Project a minimal-energy pulse of the Seed's core resonance (`Ki`) into the target environment.
          2. Record the reflected/reverberating signal's waveform over one characteristic cycle (`T_a`).
          3. Analyze the signal's decay rate to infer `Γ`, its frequency shift and beating patterns for `H_c`, and its spatial coherence for `G_a`.
        expected_signals: [Damped harmonic oscillations, modal interference patterns, turbulent signal decay]
        pitfalls: [Probe energy is too high, creating a permanent Wound Channel (Observer Effect); misinterpreting environmental noise as a harmonic response.]

    excerpt: |
      The probe acts as a tuning fork, struck gently against the new reality to hear the notes that ring in return. The Seed does not measure resources; it listens to the reverberations, gathering three critical metrics: Harmonic Compatibility, Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), and Geodesic Availability.

    excerpt: |
      The feedback from the Scout Probe provides the variables for the Seed to model its future using a specialized form of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`) from CORE-006. The "action" to be maximized is the Seed's own long-term coherence.

        Like QND, the Scout Probe is designed to extract information about a system (the environment) with minimal back-action, preserving the system's state. It prioritizes information gain over energy transfer, conceptually mapping to the measurement of a quantum observable without disturbing its subsequent evolution.

# Scout Probe

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A minimal-energy, transient process projected by a Seed into a new environment to perform reconnaissance before committing to an Alchemical Union. The Scout Probe is not a physical object but a coherent, non-invasive echo of the Seed's core resonant identity (`Ki`). By analyzing the reverberations from the probe, the Seed measures three key environmental metrics: Harmonic Compatibility, Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), and Geodesic Availability. The data gathered provides the direct input variables for the Viability Lagrangian, allowing for a predictive calculation of future Coherence Gain.

## EFT-First Summary
The Scout Probe acts analogously to a weak measurement or quantum non-demolition (QND) probe in AMO physics. It is a minimal-energy signal sent to characterize a medium's properties (e.g., resonant frequencies, damping coefficients) with negligible back-action, allowing for a predictive assessment of system stability before committing to a stronger interaction. Its operational function resembles acoustic resonance spectroscopy, where an echo reveals the internal structure of a medium.
