    Promote classical fields φ(x) and their conjugate momenta π(x) to operators (φ̂, π̂) that obey the equal-time commutation relation [φ̂(t,x), π̂(t,y)] = iħδ³(x-y). This rule dictates the fundamental uncertainty and particle-wave duality of quantum reality.

    To bridge the classical and quantum worlds. This procedure translates the deterministic language of fields into the probabilistic language of particles and their interactions, making the theory predictive for high-precision quantum phenomena.

  The standard procedure for promoting the classical Coherence (C) and Temporal Pressure (Γ) fields, and their conjugate momenta, to quantum operators. These operators are defined on a Hilbert space and are constrained to obey canonical equal-time commutation relations (ETCRs). This process gives rise to the particle interpretation of the fields—coherons (from C) and pressurons (from Γ)—and provides the formal foundation for calculating scattering amplitudes and decay rates via propagators and interaction vertices.

        outline: |
          1. Use canonical quantization to derive the Feynman rules from the Pirouette Lagrangian, specifically the vertex strength `g` for the `g|C|²Γ` interaction.
          2. Calculate the tree-level decay width for a pressuron decaying to a coheron-anti-coheron pair (Γ → C C̄), assuming m_Γ > 2m_C.
          3. In a particle accelerator or via cosmological observation, produce pressurons and measure their resonance width from the invariant mass distribution of their decay products.
          4. Compare the measured width to the theoretical prediction: Γ_width = [g² / (8π m_Γ)] * sqrt(1 - 4m_C²/m_Γ²).
        expected_signals: [A resonance peak in the C C̄ invariant mass spectrum at m_Γ, A measured decay width consistent with the theoretical prediction for a given `g`]
        pitfalls: [Large loop corrections modifying the tree-level result, Misidentification of decay products, Kinematically forbidden decay (m_Γ < 2m_C)]

    excerpt: |
      We promote the classical Pirouette matter sector to a quantum field theory on a (possibly curved) **globally hyperbolic** spacetime. Quantization yields quanta of (C) ("coherons", complex scalar) and of (Γ) ("pressurons", real scalar). **This does not make "time a particle"**: we quantize a *field valued in temporal pressure*, not the time coordinate itself. Interactions arise from (V), producing Feynman rules in the usual way.

      Write conjugate momenta: ( Π_C = ∂₀ C* ), ( Π_{C*} = ∂₀ C ), ( Π_Γ = ∂₀Γ ). Equal-time commutators: [ [Ĉ(t,**x**),Π̂_C(t,**y**)] = i,δ⁽³⁾(**x**−**y**), [Γ̂(t,**x**),Π̂_Γ(t,**y**)] = i,δ⁽³⁾(**x**−**y**), ], all others zero. Microcausality holds when fields are expanded in positive/negative frequency modes with respect to the chosen foliation.

      justification: |
        The procedure is a direct application of the standard canonical quantization formalism from quantum field theory to the specific scalar fields C and Γ of the Pirouette Framework. It involves the same steps: identifying conjugate momenta from the Lagrangian, imposing equal-time commutation relations, and deriving the particle spectrum and interactions.

    Canonical Quantization applies to the fields C(x) and Γ(x), which are functions defined over spacetime. It must not be confused with quantizing the spacetime coordinates themselves, particularly the time coordinate `t`. The resulting quantum of the Γ field, the pressuron, is an excitation of that *field*, not a "particle of time."

# Canonical Quantization

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The standard procedure for promoting the classical Coherence (C) and Temporal Pressure (Γ) fields, and their conjugate momenta, to quantum operators. These operators are defined on a Hilbert space and are constrained to obey equal-time commutation relations (ETCRs). This process gives rise to the particle interpretation of the fields—coherons (from C) and pressurons (from Γ)—and provides the foundation for calculating scattering amplitudes and decay rates via propagators and interaction vertices.

## EFT-First Summary
This is a direct application of the standard textbook procedure of canonical quantization from quantum field theory to the Pirouette Framework's scalar fields, C (complex) and Γ (real). Starting from the classical Lagrangian, one defines the conjugate momenta and imposes equal-time commutation relations, `[φ, π] = iδ`, to promote the fields to operators. This yields a quantum theory of interacting scalar particles whose behavior is described by Feynman rules derived from the potential V(|C|², Γ). See Peskin & Schroeder, Chapter 2, for the foundational formalism.
