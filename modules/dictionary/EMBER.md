    The glow of an ember is the light of a resonant pattern straining to maintain its integrity against the deafening noise of its own becoming. It is a system turning its own song into a forge.
  law: |
    An Ember state is initiated when the rate of Temporal Pressure generation by a system's own Ki (Γ̇_gen) exceeds the rate of local dissipation (Γ̇_diss), leading to exponential growth in local Γ until a Sigma bifurcation is reached. If Γ̇_gen ≤ Γ̇_diss, the system remains stable or cools.
  philosophy: |
    The Ember demonstrates that the impetus for transformation need not be external. A system can become its own crucible, forcing itself to evolve or perish. This principle of self-generated trial underpins the universe's capacity for autopoietic complexification.
pirouette_definition: |
  A self-reinforcing feedback loop where a system's own resonant pattern (Ki) generates local Temporal Pressure (Γ) at a rate exceeding its dissipation. This process causes an exponential increase in temporal friction, creating a localized "hot spot" of coherence under duress that drives the system toward an irreversible bifurcation point (Σ).

          1.  Establish a baseline measurement of a system's local Temporal Pressure (Γ_local) and its Ki spectral signature.
          2.  Continuously monitor Γ_local and the amplitude/frequency of the primary Ki mode.
          3.  Identify an Ember by detecting a positive correlation where an increase in Ki amplitude leads to an accelerating (super-linear) increase in Γ_local.
          4.  Confirm by observing the system approach a phase transition (dissolution or Ki morphogenesis).

      An ember forms when a system's own resonance enters a self-reinforcing feedback loop. The expression of its own Ki pattern begins to intensify the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) more than it dissipates it. This creates a "hot spot" in the coherence manifold—a localized, incandescent knot of temporal friction where the cost of existence begins to climb exponentially.
  - module: DOMA-005
    excerpt: |
      This entire ordeal is an expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence... The "fire" is a dramatic and sustained increase in the Temporal Pressure term, V_Γ. This makes the existing state of coherence, K_τ, untenable... The act of "forging" is the system's search for a new Ki—a new expression of K_τ—that can successfully maximize 𝓛_p under these new, brutal conditions.

        Thermal runaway is a direct physical analog where a process generates heat, which in turn accelerates the process itself, creating a positive feedback loop that leads to a catastrophic state change (explosion, meltdown). This maps directly to the Ember's Γ̇_gen > Γ̇_diss condition and its culmination at a bifurcation point.

    An Ember is an *endogenous* process where a system heats itself. This must be distinguished from a system being heated by a powerful *exogenous* source of Temporal Pressure. The defining characteristic of an Ember is the self-reinforcing feedback loop between the system's Ki expression and its local Γ field.

# Ember

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A self-reinforcing feedback loop where a system's own resonant pattern (Ki) generates local Temporal Pressure (Γ) at a rate exceeding its dissipation. This process causes an exponential increase in temporal friction, creating a localized "hot spot" of coherence under duress that drives the system toward an irreversible bifurcation point (Σ).

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to thermal runaway, an Ember is a state where a system's internal dynamics generate "heat" (Temporal Pressure) faster than it can be radiated, leading to an unstable, accelerating rise in local energy density. This positive feedback forces a phase transition, mapping to processes like tachyonic condensation or catastrophic chemical reactions. The defining feature is the self-generated nature of the instability, contrasting with systems forced into transition by external fields.
