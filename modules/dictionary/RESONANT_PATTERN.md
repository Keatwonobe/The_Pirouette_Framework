        A duel, in this framework, is a **Resonant Test**. It is a collaborative, if adversarial, creation of a high-pressure environment where two coherence patterns are measured against one another... The "blades" of this duel are the interfering frequencies of each system's `Ki`... An untested `Ki` is merely a hypothesis; a tested `Ki` is a truth.

  art: |
    The unique song a system sings to itself, composed of its history, form, and intent. It is the signature melody that must prove its harmony against the dissonance of another's truth.
  law: |
    A system's Resonant Pattern is the Fourier decomposition of its coherence manifold; its persistence is determined by its ability to maintain a positive-definite Lagrangian (`𝓛_p > 0`) under the adversarial temporal pressure (`V_Γ`) imposed by an external pattern during a Resonant Test.
  philosophy: |
    The Resonant Pattern represents an entity's identity as a testable hypothesis. Its existence is not a given right but a state that must be continuously proven through interaction, demonstrating its information is robust enough to justify its energetic cost.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Resonant Pattern (Ki) is the unique, multi-frequency signature that defines a coherent system's identity and state. It is the information-bearing pattern, expressed as a superposition of resonant modes, that is subjected to validation during a Resonant Test. The integrity and persistence of a Ki are governed by its efficiency in maximizing internal coherence (`K_τ`) while minimizing dissipation under the temporal pressure (`V_Γ`) imposed by an opposing pattern, as arbitrated by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

        outline: |
          Expose a target system (A) to a calibrated probe system (B) with a known Ki_B. Observe the interaction dynamics as a Resonant Test. The resulting interference patterns, mode shifts, and entropic cost (dissipation rate) in system A reveal the spectral components of its Ki_A. This is analogous to a scattering experiment, where the resulting Wound Channel encodes the interaction cross-section.

    excerpt: |
      To be is to hold a pattern. To *know* what you are is to hold that pattern against another. An entity in isolation is a song sung to itself—a pure but untested hypothesis. To become a truth, it must be validated... The "Duel" is the inevitable dynamic that follows—a lawful contest, arbitrated by the `Pirouette Lagrangian`, to determine which resonant pattern (`Ki`) can persist under the intense pressure of the other's existence.
  - module: DOMA-006
    excerpt: |
      The "blades" of this duel are the interfering frequencies of each system's `Ki`. Where they constructively interfere, a momentary harmony is found. Where they destructively interfere, a "node beat" of pure dissonance emerges—a point of intense temporal friction and a test of integrity. The contest becomes a competition in elegance: can a system's pattern maintain its structure when subjected to the contrary frequencies of another?

        The Resonant Pattern, like a quantum state vector, is described as a superposition of fundamental modes (frequencies). Its validation through a 'Resonant Test' mirrors the process of measurement, where interaction collapses a superposition or tests the stability of an eigenstate against a perturbation. The "interfering frequencies" of a duel map directly to the interference of probability amplitudes.

    `Ki` (the pattern) should not be confused with `K_τ` (the kinetic term of the Pirouette Lagrangian). `Ki` is the *what*—the blueprint or state of the system—while `K_τ` is part of the *how*—the dynamics that govern its evolution and stability. `Ki` is a vector-like object, whereas `K_τ` is a scalar quantity.

# Resonant Pattern

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Resonant Pattern (Ki) is the unique, multi-frequency signature that defines a coherent system's identity and state. It is the information-bearing pattern, expressed as a superposition of resonant modes, that is subjected to validation during a Resonant Test. The integrity and persistence of a Ki are governed by its efficiency in maximizing internal coherence (`K_τ`) while minimizing dissipation under the temporal pressure (`V_Γ`) imposed by an opposing pattern, as arbitrated by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, a system's Resonant Pattern (Ki) is analogous to its quantum state vector `|ψ⟩`. It represents a superposition of fundamental modes or eigenstates, `|φ_n⟩`, which define the system's identity. Interaction with another system (a Resonant Test) is analogous to a measurement or perturbation, where the interference of these modes determines the outcome (e.g., persistence, fracture, or fusion). The pattern's stability under duress reflects the robustness of the information it encodes.
