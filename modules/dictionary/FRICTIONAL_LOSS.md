  art: |
    The audible hiss of a system's intentions failing to land. It is the heat of a misspent opportunity, the difference between the intended note and the discordant noise produced.
  law: |
    Frictional Loss is the measured difference between total energy consumed by a system and the coherent work it performs: Φ_f = E_total - W_coherent. A non-zero Φ_f is a direct, quantifiable indicator of turbulent flow.
  philosophy: |
    Abstract entropic debt is made concrete. Frictional Loss transforms a system's inefficiency from a theoretical failure into a quantifiable, operational cost, forcing a Weaver to confront the immediate, tangible waste of incoherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  A practical, field-measurable approximation of the integrated Coherence Cost. It is calculated as the scalar difference between the total energy (E_total) consumed by a system over a given interval and the coherent, work-performing output (W_coherent) generated by the system in that same interval. It quantifies the energy dissipated as non-functional outputs such as heat, noise, and structural stress due to turbulent flow.

          1. Define the thermodynamic boundary of the system and a time interval (Δt).
          2. Measure all energy inputs (E_in) and the net change in the system's internal stored energy (ΔU) over Δt. Calculate `E_total = E_in - ΔU`.
          3. Identify the system's primary function and measure its useful work output (W_coherent). This may be mechanical work, information throughput, or increase in potential energy.
          4. Calculate the loss: `Φ_f = E_total - W_coherent`.

    excerpt: |
      The cumulative **Entropy Ledger** (`S_ledger`) is the integral of this rate over time. It is the running tally of the system's temporal debt—the total amount of order it has converted into noise. For practical field applications, `Ṡ_local` can often be approximated by measuring **Frictional Loss (Φ_f)**, where `Φ_f = (Total Energy Expended) - (Coherent Work Performed)`.
  - module: DOMA-068
    excerpt: |
      **Turbulent Flow**, by definition, is a deviation from this geodesic. The system is failing to maximize its coherence (`S_actual < S_ideal`). The Coherence Cost, `Ṡ_local`, is the direct, measurable price of that failure. The ledger, therefore, is not just a record of waste; it is a log of a system's deviation from the universe's most fundamental law, proportional to the action squandered on inelegant motion.

        The operational definition `Φ_f = E_total - W_coherent` is a direct analogue to the first law of thermodynamics applied to an open system, or the work-energy theorem with non-conservative forces. It represents the portion of total energy expenditure that is converted into entropy (primarily heat) rather than performing the system's intended function.

      rationale: This term from classical thermodynamics is the most direct and operationally identical concept, representing energy lost from a system's primary function to friction, heat, and other irreversible processes.

      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "The discovery of a system with significant, persistent Frictional Loss that consistently registers a Turbulence Index near zero (T_idx ≈ 0). This would imply a coherent, laminar mode of energy dissipation not accounted for by the turbulence model."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the more fundamental **Coherence Cost** (`Ṡ_local`), which is a theoretical rate derived from Temporal Pressure and the Turbulence Index. Frictional Loss is the integrated, practical *measurement* of that cost's effects over an interval, an empirical quantity dominated by thermal and acoustic dissipation.

# Frictional Loss

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A practical, field-measurable approximation of the integrated Coherence Cost. It is calculated as the scalar difference between the total energy (E_total) consumed by a system over a given interval and the coherent, work-performing output (W_coherent) generated by the system in that same interval. It quantifies the energy dissipated as non-functional outputs such as heat, noise, and structural stress due to turbulent flow.

## EFT-First Summary
Frictional Loss (Φ_f) is the direct operational analogue of **Dissipated Energy** in classical thermodynamics. It quantifies the energy converted into entropy (e.g., heat) due to non-conservative, irreversible processes within a system, preventing that energy from performing useful work. It is calculated via an energy balance audit: `Φ_f = E_total - W_coherent`. In the Pirouette Framework, this dissipation is understood to be the primary macroscopic signature of underlying turbulent flow.
