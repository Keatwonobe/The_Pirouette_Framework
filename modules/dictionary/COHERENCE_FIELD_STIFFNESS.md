        m^2 = \frac{V''(\Gamma_0)}{K_\Gamma} = \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 .

  art: |
    The resistance of time's fabric to perturbation; a local tension that manifests as the inertia of a particle. Mass is the memory of time's elastic response.
  law: |
    The squared stiffness, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2$, contributes additively to a particle's total invariant mass-squared, $\mathcal{M}^2 = \mathcal{R}_\tau + \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2$. Its value evolves with energy scale $\Lambda$ according to the renormalization group equation $\frac{d\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2}{d\ln\Lambda} = c_1 g_N^2 \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2$.
  philosophy: |
    Mass is not an inherent property of a particle, but a measure of the local elastic stress in the temporal substrate caused by the particle's presence. This reframes inertia as a geometric response rather than a fundamental charge, unifying the origin of mass with the curvature of spacetime.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence Field Stiffness, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}$, is a scalar field representing the local elastic modulus of the temporal substrate ($\tau$-manifold). Its squared value, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2$, contributes directly and additively to the total invariant mass-squared, $\mathcal{M}^2$, of a particle or field excitation. In regions of negligible temporal curvature ($\mathcal{R}_\tau \approx 0$), it is the dominant source of rest mass, defined by the second derivative of the coherence field potential, $m^2 = V''(\Gamma_0)/K_\Gamma$.

          Measure the running of a particle's rest mass as a function of scattering energy ($\Lambda$). The logarithmic dependence of the mass-squared, as predicted by the $\beta$-function, allows for the inference of $\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}$ and its coupling to the gauge sector.

    excerpt: |
      This correspondence completes the equivalence between energy density, curvature, and temporal elasticity. We demonstrate that all inertial masses within the Pirouette framework... arise from a single geometric invariant: $\mathcal{M}^2 = \mathcal{R}_\tau + \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2$, where $\mathcal{R}_\tau$ is the Ricci scalar of the temporal substrate and $\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}$ the local stiffness of the coherence field.

    excerpt: |
      The torsion-based coupling in CORE-006 gives the effective mass term for fermions $m_f = y_\Gamma\Gamma_0 + \frac{1}{4} \langle R_\tau\rangle$. Hence fermion rest mass equals a linear combination of substrate stiffness and curvature—time geometry and elastic response intertwined.

# Coherence Field Stiffness

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Coherence Field Stiffness, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}$, is a scalar field representing the local elastic modulus of the temporal substrate ($\tau$-manifold). Its squared value, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2$, contributes directly and additively to the total invariant mass-squared, $\mathcal{M}^2$, of a particle or field excitation. In regions of negligible temporal curvature ($\mathcal{R}_\tau \approx 0$), it is the dominant source of rest mass, defined by the second derivative of the coherence field potential, $m^2 = V''(\Gamma_0)/K_\Gamma$.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory, Coherence Field Stiffness ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}$) is directly analogous to the mass scale derived from the curvature of a scalar field potential at its minimum, $m^2 = V''(\phi_0)$. It represents the energy cost of exciting the field out of its vacuum, which manifests as inertial mass. Unlike a simple Higgs mechanism, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}$ is part of a larger geometric invariant, $\mathfrak{M}^2 = \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 + (\text{curvature terms})$, which unifies mass from potential energy with mass from spacetime geometry. This provides a direct link between the Standard Model concept of mass-from-potential and the Pirouette framework's geometric interpretation.
