  art: |
    A single song played on a multi-octave instrument. The universe whispers the same command to the lightning, the river, and the neuron, creating a resonant hierarchy where the solution to 'how to be' is the same at every scale.
  law: |
    A system is in a state of scale-invariant resonance when its generative geodesic, the optimal solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian, is self-similar. This state is empirically confirmed by a high, stable Inter-Scale Coherence (`T_a_scale` > 0.8) and a well-defined Generative Rhythm (`ω_g`) across the observed scales.
  philosophy: |
    This state reveals that complexity is not chaos but a disciplined expression of a single, efficient logic repeated across scales. It provides the fundamental grammar for growth, demonstrating that the most resilient and coherent structures emerge from a single, elegant rule applied infinitely.
pirouette_definition: |
  A state in which the optimal path for a system to maximize its coherence against environmental pressure (the Pirouette Geodesic) is self-similar across multiple scales. This resonance creates fractal structures not as static shapes, but as the physical trace of the most efficient, recursive solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian, characterized by high inter-scale coherence (`T_a_scale`) and a distinct generative rhythm (`ω_g`).

          1. Isolate the data stream (time series, spatial data) exhibiting potential self-similarity.
          2. Apply computational methods to quantify signatures: Box-Counting or Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM) for `D_f`; Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) or wavelet coherence for `T_a_scale`; Fourier Transform or wavelet scalograms for `ω_g`.
          3. A state of resonance is confirmed when `T_a_scale` is high and stable across a wide range of scales, and `ω_g` corresponds to the primary iterative scale of the system's structure.

    excerpt: |
      A fractal is the structure that emerges when this optimal path is self-similar—when the answer to "what is the most coherent way to be?" is the same at the scale of the leaf as it is at the scale of the branch, and the scale of the tree. This is a state of **scale-invariant resonance**. The pattern is a single song played on a multi-octave instrument.
  - module: DOMA-136
    excerpt: |
      A system adopts this structure not for aesthetic reasons, but because this resonant hierarchy *is* the most energetically efficient and resilient solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation, solved everywhere, all at once.

        An RG fixed point describes a system whose Hamiltonian (and thus physical properties) is invariant under a change of scale transformation (R_Λ). This is a direct mathematical parallel to a system whose optimal generative logic (geodesic) is identical at all scales, leading to the self-similarity and power-law scaling characteristic of Scale-Invariant Resonance. This state is often found at critical points of phase transitions.

    Unlike simple frequency resonance, which involves amplification at a single temporal or spatial frequency, Scale-Invariant Resonance refers to a resonance in the *generative logic* of a system across a continuous or discrete hierarchy of scales. It is a resonance of pattern, not of oscillation.

# Scale-Invariant Resonance

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A state in which the optimal path for a system to maximize its coherence against environmental pressure (the Pirouette Geodesic) is self-similar across multiple scales. This resonance creates fractal structures not as static shapes, but as the physical trace of the most efficient, recursive solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian, characterized by high inter-scale coherence (`T_a_scale`) and a distinct generative rhythm (`ω_g`).

## EFT-First Summary
Scale-Invariant Resonance is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to a **Renormalization Group (RG) Fixed Point** in statistical physics. Just as an RG fixed point describes a system at a critical point whose physical laws are invariant under a change of scale, Scale-Invariant Resonance describes a system whose optimal generative logic is identical across a hierarchy of scales. This state gives rise to the power-law correlations and fractal geometries observed in systems ranging from critical-phase materials to biological networks.
