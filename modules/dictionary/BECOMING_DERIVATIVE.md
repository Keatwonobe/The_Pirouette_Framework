  art: |
    The shadow cast by the immediate future, averaging over all possible tomorrows to define the direction of today's flow. It is the tug of what might be, quantified in the present.
  law: |
    The δ-derivative of any observable F on a fabric E is the expectation value of its change, F(E') - F(E), over all possible one-step extensions E', weighted by the growth probability P(E'|E) ∝ exp(-ΔS). An observable F is the basis of a martingale if and only if δF(E) = 0.
  philosophy: |
    δ replaces the smooth, infinitesimal change of classical calculus (d/dt) with a discrete, probabilistic one-step change tailored to the ontology of becoming. It provides the core computational tool for evolving observables and finding conserved quantities in a fundamentally stochastic, acausal substrate.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Becoming Derivative, δF(E), of a real-valued functional F on a fabric E, is the expected change in F over a single probabilistic growth step. It is calculated by summing the change F(E') - F(E) for each possible single-event extension E', weighted by the probability of that extension, P(E'|E), which is derived from the Action functional S.
  [
  \delta F(E) := \sum_{P \in \text{Admissible}(E)} \mathbb{P}(C^+_P|E) \big(F(E_{P}) - F(E)\big)
  ]
  where E_P is the fabric E after applying the creation operator C⁺_P, and the probability \(\mathbb{P}(C^+_P|E) \propto \exp(-\Delta S(E;P))\).

        outline: |
          1. Given a fabric E, an observable F, and an Action S.
          2. Identify all admissible parent sets P on the causal frontier of E.
          3. For each P, compute the action change ΔS(E;P) and the observable change ΔF_P = F(E_P) - F(E).
          4. Compute the unnormalized weights w_P = exp(-ΔS(E;P)).
          5. Normalize the weights to get probabilities p_P = w_P / Σ_Q w_Q.
          6. The Becoming Derivative is the weighted average of the changes: δF(E) = Σ_P p_P * ΔF_P.
        expected_signals:
          - A single real number representing the expected one-step drift of F.
          - If δF(E) ≈ 0 over a range of fabrics, F is an approximate conserved quantity (martingale).
        pitfalls:
          - The set of admissible parents (the "growth frontier") can be large, making the sum computationally expensive.
          - Requires a well-defined and computable Action functional S.

    excerpt: |
      Creation/annihilation act as derivations:
      * (D^+(\cdot) :=) formal sum over admissible (C^+_P) insertions.
      * (D^-(E):=) sum over deletions of maximal events.
      * **Becoming derivative**: (\delta F(E) := \mathbb{E}[F(E \cup\text{new})-F(E)]).

      This is your **calculus**: everything reduces to counting convex subposets and their changes under (C^+_P).

        (Lf)(x) = \sum_{y} W(x \to y) (f(y) - f(x))
      justification: |
        The Becoming Derivative has the same mathematical form as the generator of a discrete-time, continuous-state Markov process. The fabric E is the state, F is a function on the state space, and P(E'|E) are the transition probabilities. δ is the operator that generates the one-step evolution of the expectation of F.

        In classical statistical mechanics, the Liouvillian governs the time evolution of the phase space distribution. Conceptually, δ governs the "time" evolution (probabilistic growth) of observables on the space of fabrics. It acts as the generator of the dynamics.

  disambiguation: |
    This δ is an operator acting on functions over the space of fabrics; it is not the variational derivative (δS/δφ), which measures the response to a field perturbation on a fixed background. The Becoming Derivative computes the expected change of an observable under the probabilistic growth of the background fabric itself. It is a discrete, probabilistic analogue to a time derivative, d/dt.
