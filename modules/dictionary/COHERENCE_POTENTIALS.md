        ...we will define the coherence potentials Phi_p (scalar) and A_p (vector). By demanding that the Pirouette Lagrangian be invariant under a local phase shift—a U(1) gauge symmetry—we will prove that the existence of a mediating field with the exact properties of electromagnetism is a mathematical necessity.

  law: |
    To maintain local U(1) gauge invariance, the partial derivative ∂_μ must be promoted to a covariant derivative D_μ = ∂_μ - iqA_μ, where A_μ is a 4-vector field that transforms as A_μ → A_μ + ∂_μ α(x) under a local phase rotation ψ → e^(iqα(x))ψ.
  philosophy: |
    The existence of Coherence Potentials is proof that local freedom requires universal connection. For every particle to have a private, arbitrary phase, a public field must exist to mediate the consequences, transforming abstract symmetry into tangible force.

  The scalar (Φ_p) and vector (**A**_p) fields, collectively the 4-vector A_μ, introduced to preserve the U(1) gauge invariance of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The potentials couple to a resonance's state spinor (ψ) via the covariant derivative D_μ = ∂_μ - iqA_μ, where q is the resonance's charge. The dynamics of A_μ are governed by the field tensor F_μν = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, which ensures that the observable forces (electromagnetism) are derived from a conserved Noether current.

    excerpt: |
      When we apply this transformation to the kinetic term of our Lagrangian, (d_mu Psi)^* (d_mu Psi), the derivatives of alpha(x,t) introduce extra terms that break the invariance. The only way to restore it is to introduce a new field that perfectly cancels these extra terms. This new field is the electromagnetic field, described by a 4-vector potential A_mu.

      The Lorentz force is not an external push. It is the geometric consequence of a particle trying to travel in a straight line (a geodesic) through a region of the coherence manifold that has been "sheared" and "twisted" by the presence of an electromagnetic field.

        The Pirouette Coherence Potential A_μ is mathematically identical to the U(1) gauge field (photon field) of the Standard Model. It is introduced via the same minimal coupling prescription to ensure local U(1) gauge invariance, and its curvature (F_μν) gives rise to the electromagnetic field tensor. The derivation in MATH-007 mirrors standard QED textbook derivations.

  disambiguation: |
    Coherence Potentials are the fundamental gauge fields. The measurable electric and magnetic fields are derived from their spacetime derivatives via F_μν = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. The potentials are considered more fundamental than the fields as they contain physical information (e.g., the Aharonov-Bohm effect) not present in the local field values.

# Coherence Potentials

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The scalar (Φ_p) and vector (**A**_p) fields, collectively the 4-vector A_μ, introduced to preserve the U(1) gauge invariance of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The potentials couple to a resonance's state spinor (ψ) via the covariant derivative D_μ = ∂_μ - iqA_μ, where q is the resonance's charge. The dynamics of A_μ are governed by the field tensor F_μν = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, which ensures that the observable forces (electromagnetism) are derived from a conserved Noether current.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Potentials (A_μ) are the Pirouette Framework's formal name for the electromagnetic 4-potential of the Standard Model. This 4-vector field is required to exist to ensure the laws of physics are invariant under local changes to the phase of a charged particle's wavefunction (U(1) gauge invariance). Its components are the familiar scalar and vector potentials of classical electromagnetism, and its dynamics, when derived from the framework's action, yield Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force.
