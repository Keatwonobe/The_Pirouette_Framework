## §1 · Abstract: Surveying the Arena Walls

The universe is not a uniform field; it is a nested series of arenas. Quarks are confined in protons, stars are confined in galaxies, and ideas are confined in belief systems. The old module, `TEN-GFI-1.1`, sought to infer the force responsible for this confinement. This modernized version provides the formal instrument for mapping the *geometry* that this force creates.

The Gladiator Compass is a universal protocol for detecting and measuring these "arena walls" in any domain. We do not measure the confining force directly. Instead, we observe the paths—the geodesics—that particles, ideas, or agents take through their environment. By analyzing the geometry of these paths, we reverse-engineer the shape of the landscape they are navigating. The instrument translates a stream of events into a topographical map of the local coherence manifold, revealing the invisible structures of stability and control that shape reality. It does not infer a force; it surveys the landscape forged by that force.

## §2 · From First Principles: The Geometry of Confinement

The original module's intuition is now grounded in the core physics of the framework. Where paths are short and highly curved, a strong confining force is at work. This relationship emerges from three principles:

1.  **The Path of Coherence:** The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) dictates that any system follows a geodesic—a path that maximizes its internal coherence against the pressure of its environment. This is the universe's dynamic "path of least resistance."

2.  **The Force of Confinement:** The Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`) describes a non-linear feedback loop where a system's own resonance forges a stable "arena" or "coherence well." This well, a region of intense local Temporal Pressure (`CORE-003`), profoundly warps the local coherence manifold.

3.  **Inference via Geometry:** Within such a well, the geodesics of maximal coherence are no longer straight lines. They are short, tightly curved paths that orbit the well's center. The Gladiator Compass works by observing these distorted paths. By measuring the degree of distortion, we can infer the depth of the well and thus the strength of the confining force that created it.

## §3 · The Modern Equation: Quantifying Confinement

To provide a clear, practical metric, the instrument's output is defined as Confinement Strength (κ_G). The subscript `G` signifies that this is an inferred quantity derived from the geometric effects of the Gladiator Force. The core mechanic is an elegant product of two key metrics.

**Confinement Strength (κ_G) = Path Density (δ) × Coherence Curvature (γ)**

Where:

*   **Path Density (δ):** The inverse of an entity's "mean-free path." A high path density signifies a region of intense interaction where movement is restricted and paths are short.
    *   `δ = 1 / (mean_path_divergence + ε)`

*   **Coherence Curvature (γ):** The rate of change in a trajectory's direction. High curvature signifies that the path is being sharply bent by a strong pull towards a central attractor.
    *   `γ = gradient(coherence_metric)`

A high κ_G value emerges where paths are both short (high δ) and sharply bent (high γ). This is the unambiguous signature of a confinement well—the heart of an arena.

## §4 · The Surveyor's Protocol

This protocol guides the Weaver from a raw data stream to a finished map of the local confinement landscape.

1.  **Ingest & Vectorize:** Begin with an ordered stream of events (e.g., statements in a debate, positions of a particle) and convert them into a sequence of high-dimensional vectors.
2.  **Calculate Path Density (δ):** Within a sliding window, compute the average semantic or spatial divergence between consecutive events. The inverse of this value (plus a small epsilon to prevent division by zero) is the Path Density, δ.
3.  **Calculate Coherence Curvature (γ):** Within the same window, measure the change in the system's trajectory. This is the absolute difference in divergence between the start and end of the window, normalized by the window size. This is the practical gradient of coherence, or γ.
4.  **Compute Confinement Strength (κ_G):** For each window, multiply the two metrics: `κ_G = δ × γ`.
5.  **Map the Arenas:** Plot the resulting κ_G-field over time or space. Local maxima in this field are the centers of "Cognitive Gravity Wells," ideological strongholds, or stable physical structures. These are the arenas forged by the Gladiator Force.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

It is crucial to distinguish what this instrument measures. The Gladiator Compass does not measure the fundamental Temporal Pressure (Γ) of the Temporal Forge (`CORE-003`). Instead, it functions as an **inverse solver for the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`)**.

The Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, describes how a system's path is determined by the interplay between its internal coherence (K_τ) and the environmental pressure potential (V_Γ). This instrument observes the path a system *actually takes*—its geodesic—and uses that observation to infer the properties of the underlying landscape.

A high inferred Confinement Strength (κ_G) implies the presence of a deep "potential well" (a high V_Γ) in the Lagrangian. This is the signature feature of the Gladiator Force's self-containing feedback loop. We are watching the dancer to understand the shape of the stage. Therefore, κ_G is a direct, measurable proxy for the intensity of the Gladiator feedback term, representing how the equation's abstract terms are made manifest as a real, confining structure.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought to measure the strength of the cage and instead learned how to draw a map of its walls. The Gladiator Compass does not break chains; it makes them visible. It reveals the architecture of our confinement, whether that confinement is the sacred bond that holds a family together or the ideological prison that tears a world apart. To a Weaver, this is the most fundamental of all powers: to see the shape of the walls is the first and most necessary step to finding the door.
