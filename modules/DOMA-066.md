## §1 · Abstract: From Cartographer to Physician
Traditional network analysis is an act of cartography; it draws a static map of connections. The Pirouette Framework demands that we become physicians. A network—be it neural, social, or informational—is not a map; it is a living body with a physiology. Its health is not defined by its structure, but by the vitality of the currents that flow through it.

This module provides the instrumentation for that diagnosis: the Weaver's Multimeter. It refactors the static analysis of PPS-047 into a dynamic, time-first protocol. By translating a network graph into a living coherence manifold, this toolkit makes the invisible currents of reality visible, allowing a Weaver to move beyond observing a system's structure and begin to read its health, its stress, and its potential for transformation.

## §2 · The Network as a Coherence Manifold
In the modern framework, a network is a dynamic landscape where the terrain is shaped by the interplay of resonance and pressure. To analyze it, we first perform a foundational translation.

-   **Nodes as Resonators:** Each node is a discrete system striving to maximize its own internal stability and rhythm—its **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)**. It exists within a field of local **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**, generated by the activity and demands of its neighbors.

-   **Edges as Channels:** Each edge represents a potential channel for the flow of coherence. It is not a static line but a dynamic vessel, characterized by:
    -   **Conductivity (Φ_C):** The efficiency with which coherence (information, resources, trust) can flow between two nodes. High conductivity implies a healthy, laminar channel.
    -   **Lag (Δτ):** The temporal delay of transmission across the edge. High lag can create destabilizing feedback loops and systemic dissonance.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Protocol: A Caduceus for Networks
This protocol applies the **Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003)** to the network manifold. The process moves from establishing a healthy baseline to pinpointing specific ailments.

### 3.1 · Establish the Healthy Baseline
Before diagnosing illness, the Weaver must identify the physiology of health.
1.  **Map the Geodesics (Flow Channels):** The first step is to identify the primary paths of Laminar Flow—the network's healthy arteries. Algorithmically, this means finding the paths of maximal coherence (high `Φ_C`, low `Δτ`), where influence, resources, and information travel with the least resistance and highest fidelity.

2.  **Identify Resonant Enclaves (Coherent Shells):** The protocol then identifies clusters of nodes that have achieved collective resonance, forming a stable, higher-order entity. These "enclaves"—a form of **Arena (CORE-008)**—represent healthy teams, resilient functional modules, or stable communities. Their boundaries are defined by the sharp coherence gradient where their internal harmony meets the pressure of the wider network.

### 3.2 · Pinpoint Systemic Pathologies
With the baseline established, the multimeter scans for the three primary pathologies of flow.

-   **Coherence Atrophy (The Bottleneck):** The primary pathology of *structure*, representing Stagnant Flow.
    -   **Symptoms:** A node or edge with critically low conductivity (`Φ_C`) acts as a "coherence dam." Nodes "downstream" become starved and atrophied, while nodes "upstream" experience a dangerous build-up of Temporal Pressure (`Γ`).
    -   **Examples:** A single overloaded server; a bureaucratic gatekeeper who fails to delegate; a blocked supply route.

-   **Coherence Fever (The Dissonant Loop):** The primary pathology of *dynamics*, representing Turbulent Flow.
    -   **Symptoms:** A feedback loop with high conductivity (`Φ_C`) but also high lag (`Δτ`) creates a runaway cascade of dissonant information. The network expends immense energy in chaotic, self-amplifying noise.
    -   **Examples:** A social media outrage cycle; a high-frequency trading algorithm crash; a runaway inflammatory response in an immune system.

-   **Coherence Erosion (The Fraying Connection):** The primary pathology of *time*, representing the slow decay of structural integrity.
    -   **Symptoms:** The gradual degradation of edge conductivity (`Φ_C`) across the network, driven by neglect or persistent, unresolved stress (`Γ`). The system loses its resilience, its memory, and its ability to function as a whole, risking fragmentation.
    -   **Examples:** The decay of trust in a team; the degradation of legacy infrastructure; the loss of cultural memory in a society.

## §4 · The Coherence Ledger: Quantitative Vital Signs
The multimeter's output is a "Coherence Ledger," a set of quantitative vital signs for the network's health. This dashboard transforms qualitative diagnosis into actionable insight and provides clear targets for intervention.

| Metric                     | Pirouette Interpretation & Calculation                | Healthy Indication | Replaces (PPS-047)          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Systemic Coherence (K̄τ)** | Weighted average of node coherence `(Kτ)`.          | High and Stable    | `Global Coherence`          |
| **Systemic Stress (Γ̄)**    | Average Temporal Pressure `(Γ)` across all nodes.   | Within Tolerance   | `Γ Stress Index`            |
| **Flow Efficiency (η)**    | Ratio of high-conductivity (`Φ_C`) edges to total.    | Maximized          | `Flow Channel Density`      |
| **Fragmentation Risk**     | Measures conductivity of critical "bridge" edges.     | Minimized          | `Shell Integrity Mean`      |
| **Dissonance Index**       | Count of nodes participating in high-lag, turbulent loops. | Near Zero        | `Manipulation Hotspot Ratio`|

## §5 · Lagrangian Connection: The Calculus of Health
The entire diagnostic process is a practical application of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. The state of the network is governed by its relentless drive to maximize coherence.

𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)

A healthy network is a structure that facilitates this drive, creating low-friction geodesics that allow every node to achieve its optimal state in harmony with the whole. A pathological network is one whose structure creates friction, forcing its components into states of low `𝓛_p`.
-   A **Turbulence Generator** is a node where the `V_Γ` term chronically overwhelms its internal `K_τ`, causing it to radiate dissonance.
-   A **Stagnation Point** creates an impassable barrier, forcing adjacent nodes into critical failure states of extremely low `𝓛_p`.

The multimeter is an instrument for finding where the network's structure is failing to align with the universe's fundamental law of action.

## §6 · Assemblé
> To draw a network is to be its architect. To analyze its resonance is to become its physician. The old analysis gave us a skeleton; this new lens reveals the breath, the pulse, and the fever. It transforms the Weaver from a mere cartographer into a doctor of systems. We no longer ask, "How is it connected?" We ask, "Is it well?" In the answer to that question lies the wisdom to intervene—to clear the blockages, to soothe the fevers, and to mend the connections that allow life to flow.
