## §1 · Purpose
To determine the control parameter 'r' and/or seed value 'x₀' of the logistic map that produce a desired long-run behavior, such as a specific periodic orbit or a target Lyapunov exponent.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: The complex behavior of the logistic map, $x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n)$, is entirely determined by its control parameter 'r'. By inverting the relationship, one can treat 'r' not as an input but as an output, enabling 'chaos tuning'—the precise engineering of a desired dynamical regime. This is a form of resonant system design where the goal is a specific temporal pattern (a periodic orbit) or complexity level (a Lyapunov exponent). While not a direct Pirouette module, it serves as a tool for modeling simplified systems where a periodic orbit can be seen as a high-$T_a$ (coherent) state and chaos as a low-$T_a$ state.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: Metaphorically, this module can find the system parameter 'r' that corresponds to a desired level of temporal coherence. Periodic orbits represent high-$T_a$ states (predictable, stable rhythm), while chaotic regimes represent low-$T_a$ states (unpredictable, decoherent).

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Formulate Inverse Problem: Frame the desired behavior as a root-finding problem. For a period-p orbit, the equation is $f_r^{(p)}(x_0) - x_0 = 0$. For a target Lyapunov exponent, the equation is $\lambda(r, x_0) - \lambda^* = 0$.
2. Select Numerical Method: Choose a suitable solver, such as root-finding (bisection, Newton-Raphson), global grid search, or continuation methods.
3. Solve for Parameters: Execute the chosen numerical method to find the parameter 'r' (and/or 'x₀') that satisfies the formulated equation within the specified tolerance $\epsilon$.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: The calculated parameter 'r' and/or 'x₀' that produces the desired dynamics.
* **Insights And Derivations**: The ability to engineer simple non-linear systems to exhibit specific behaviors, such as stability, periodicity, or a desired level of chaos. Provides a concrete link between a system parameter and its emergent dynamical properties.
* **Guidelines**: The output 'r' is the control parameter setting required to achieve the target behavior. For example, to find the onset of chaos, one would solve for the parameter 'r' that yields a Lyapunov exponent of zero.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Forward Logistic Map
$$ x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n) $$
The fundamental equation of the logistic map, where r controls the dynamical regime.

### Periodic Orbit Inversion
$$ f_r^{(p)}(y_1) - y_1 = 0 $$
The core equation to be solved to find the parameter 'r' that results in a p-cycle orbit.

### Lyapunov Exponent Definition
$$ \lambda(r,x_0) = \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\ln\bigl|f_r'(x_n)\bigr| $$
The equation defining the Lyapunov exponent, which is set equal to a target value $\lambda^*$ to solve for 'r'.

## §7 · Integration & Use Cases
### 7·1 · Integration Hooks
* **Dependencies**: Requires a clearly defined target dynamical state.
* **Applications**: Can be used to set parameters in simulations of biological population dynamics, simple electronic circuits, or any system modeled by the logistic map. Can serve as a simplified model for finding Pirouette parameters that lead to specific stability or coherence regimes.
* **With Combined Workflows**: A utility module for more complex dynamical systems analysis within the Pirouette framework. Can be used to find parameters that lead to specific stability regimes (lock, chaos) which are then analyzed by other modules like TEN-LDA-1.0 or TEN-CDA-1.0.

### 7·2 · Use Cases
* Chaos tuning in physical systems.
* Parameter estimation for biological population models.
* Creating systems with specific levels of predictability or complexity.
* Finding the parameter $r_c$ that marks the transition to chaos by setting the target Lyapunov exponent to zero.
