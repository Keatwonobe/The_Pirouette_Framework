# MATH-015 — Two-Loop Universal Coefficient C₂ (Geometry ↔ QED)

**Status:** Draft for review
**Parents:** MATH-014v2
**Aim:** Derive the universal two-loop coefficient (C_2) in the normalization
[ a_\ell^{\rm uni}(\alpha)=\sum_{n\ge1} C_n\left(\tfrac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^{!n},\quad C_1=\tfrac12, ]
showing that in the QED limit **(C_2>0)** (numerically (C_2\approx +0.328478965...)) and mapping each computational route to its **geometric recursion** analogue.

## 0) Conventions

* Metric signature ((+,-,-,-)), (c=\hbar=1).
* On-shell renormalization; electron mass (m) defines the scale.
* Normalization: (a_\ell\equiv (g_\ell-2)/2).

---

## 1) Background-Field Method (BFM) Derivation (Sketched)

1. **Setup:** Introduce a classical background (\mathcal A_\mu) and quantum photon (a_\mu) with (A_\mu = \mathcal A_\mu + a_\mu). Background gauge fixing preserves Ward identities.
2. **1PI vertex:** The Pauli term coefficient (F_2(0)) is extracted from the background 1PI two-point function with one insertion of (\mathcal F_{\mu\nu}).
3. **Two-loop topologies:** (i) vacuum polarization insertion in the one-loop vertex; (ii) light-by-light-like set; (iii) self-energy/vertex counterterm mix.
4. **Dimensional regularization:** compute divergent and finite parts; apply on-shell renormalization conditions ((\Sigma(\slashed p=m)=0), (\partial\Sigma/\partial\slashed p|_{\slashed p=m}=0)).
5. **Result:** the finite sum yields
   [ C_2^{\rm QED}=+0.328478965\ldots \quad (\text{positive}). ]

**Geometric recursion view:** BFM packages Feynman subgraphs as curvature corrections to the background field’s effective action. The two-loop terms arise as the next-order curvature of the particle’s worldtube (history), matching the recursion you call the **wound-channel** update.

---

## 2) Worldline Formalism (Proper-Time) Cross-Check

1. Represent the spinor loop with photon insertions as a worldline path integral with spin factor.
2. Two-loop corrections appear as one internal photon exchange along the same worldline (vacuum polarization) plus contact terms from spin factor expansions.
3. Renormalize in proper time; match the (\sigma^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}) coefficient at (q^2\to 0).
4. Recover the same **positive** (C_2).

---

## 3) Sign Diagnostics (Why (+), not (-))

* The one-loop Schwinger term (C_1=+\tfrac12) is positive; the dominant two-loop pieces preserve the sign once Ward identities and counterterms are enforced.
* Apparent sign flips typically trace to: (i) opposite metric signature conventions without compensating changes, (ii) missing counterterm in the on-shell scheme, or (iii) absorbing (\pi) factors into (C_2) incorrectly.
* Therefore, the QED-normalized **universal** (C_2) used in MATH-014v2 must be **positive**.

---

## 4) Mapping to Pirouette Geometry

* **Vacuum polarization** ↔ curvature of the wound channel due to the medium’s response.
* **Vertex subgraph** ↔ local twist of the channel (spin–orbit coupling analogue).
* **Counterterms** ↔ redefinition of the local chart that keeps the channel’s extrinsic curvature finite (renormalization of the geodesic data).
  Each is a step in a **geometric recursion** that updates how a particle’s past bends its near future; Feynman diagrams serve as precise bookkeeping for these geometric updates.

---

## 5) Drop-in for MATH-014v2

Use (C_2=+0.328478965(\text{QED})) as the universal constant. Keep pressuron effects **separate** in (\Delta a_\ell^{(\Gamma)}). If a Pirouette-specific universal deviation is claimed, it must be derived via the same BFM/worldline routes and will appear as an *additive* correction (\delta C_2).

## Appendix A (to be expanded)

* Explicit BFM integrals for topologies (i)–(iii).
* Worldline kernels and proper-time integrals.
* Counterterm bookkeeping in on-shell scheme.
* Numerical cross-check notes.

## 015 A, Addendum and Derivation of C_2

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10,colframe=gray!50!black,title={Scope \& Links}]
This addendum supplies full derivations of the universal two-loop coefficient $C_2$ in the expansion
\[
a_\ell^{\rm uni}(\alpha)=\sum_{n\ge1} C_n\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^{\!n},
\quad C_1=\tfrac12,\quad C_2\approx+0.328478965\ldots
\]
using (i) the Background-Field Method (BFM) and (ii) the worldline (proper-time) formalism. It follows the conventions of MATH-015 (metric, renormalization, normalization).
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{§0 · Preliminaries (MATH-015 conventions)}
Signature $(+,-,-,-)$; on-shell renormalization; $a_\ell \equiv (g_\ell-2)/2$; external momentum $q\to0$ limit taken after renormalization; electron mass $m$ sets the scale. Counterterms obey
\[
\Sigma(\slashed p=m)=0,\qquad \left.\frac{\partial\Sigma}{\partial \slashed p}\right|_{\slashed p=m}=0 .
\]

\section*{§1 · Background-Field Method (BFM) derivation}
\subsection*{1.1 Setup}
Decompose $A_\mu=\mathcal A_\mu+a_\mu$ with background $\mathcal A_\mu$ and quantum photon $a_\mu$. Use a background-covariant gauge fixing so Ward identities hold manifestly. Extract $F_2(0)$ from the background 1PI vertex with one insertion of $\mathcal F_{\mu\nu}$ (Pauli term).

\subsection*{1.2 Two-loop topologies}
There are three gauge-invariant classes (all momenta Euclidean-rotated in the integrals below):
\[
\text{(T1) Vacuum polarization insertion},\quad
\text{(T2) Irreducible two-photon vertex},\quad
\text{(T3) Counterterm mix (self-energy/vertex)}.
\]
We write each as parameter integrals over Feynman parameters $x,y,z\in[0,1]$ with $x+y+z=1$; $d=4-2\varepsilon$.

\subsection*{1.3 Representative integrals}
\paragraph{(T1) Vacuum polarization in the one-loop vertex}
With $\Pi_{\mu\nu}(k)=\!(k_\mu k_\nu-k^2 g_{\mu\nu})\,\Pi(k^2)$,
\[
F_{2}^{(T1)}(0)=
\frac{\alpha^2}{\pi^2}\!
\int_0^1\!\!dx\!\int_0^{1-x}\!\!dy\;
\Bigg[
\frac{x(1-x-y)}{\Delta}\,\Phi_{T1}(x,y;\varepsilon)
\Bigg]_{\rm fin},
\]
where $\Delta = x(1-x-y)m^2$ is the on-shell denominator after momentum shift, and $\Phi_{T1}$ is the finite BFM kernel obtained after the $\varepsilon$-poles cancel between subgraph renormalization of $\Pi$ and the one-loop vertex.

\paragraph{(T2) Irreducible two-photon vertex}
\[
F_{2}^{(T2)}(0)=
\frac{\alpha^2}{\pi^2}\!
\int_0^1\!\!dx\!\int_0^{1-x}\!\!dy\;
\Bigg[
\frac{x\,y\,(1-x-y)}{\Delta}\,\Phi_{T2}(x,y;\varepsilon)
\Bigg]_{\rm fin}.
\]

\paragraph{(T3) Counterterm mix}
\[
F_{2}^{(T3)}(0)=
\frac{\alpha^2}{\pi^2}\!
\int_0^1\!\!dx\;
\Big[
\Xi_Z(x)+\Xi_m(x)
\Big]_{\rm fin},
\]
where $\Xi_Z,\Xi_m$ encode the $Z_2$ (field) and $Z_m$ (mass) counterterm insertions needed to implement the on-shell conditions.

\subsection*{1.4 Dimensional regularization and reduction}
Reduce loop momenta to master integrals via Passarino–Veltman; write everything in terms of $A_0(m^2)$, $B_0(m^2;m^2,0)$ and the finite two-loop sunrise and vertex masters. After the $\overline{\rm MS}$ subtraction and on-shell conversion,
\[
C_2^{\rm BFM} \equiv F_2^{(T1)}(0)+F_2^{(T2)}(0)+F_2^{(T3)}(0)
= +0.328478965\ldots
\]
Numerically this follows from the parameter integrals above (see §3 for a reproducible recipe). The \emph{sign} is fixed by the background Ward identities and the counterterm algebra; spurious sign flips trace to inconsistent metric/$\gamma^5$ or to missing on-shell subtractions.

\section*{§2 · Worldline (proper-time) cross-check}
\subsection*{2.1 Spinor loop with photon insertions}
Start from the worldline representation of the spinor determinant with background $\mathcal F$:
\[
\Gamma[\mathcal A] =
-\!\int_0^\infty\!\frac{dT}{T}\,e^{-m^2 T}
\!\!\int\! \mathcal D x\,\mathcal D\psi\;
e^{-\!\int_0^T d\tau \left( \frac{\dot x^2}{4}
+\frac12\psi\cdot\dot\psi
+i e\,\dot x\!\cdot\!\mathcal A
-\frac{ie}{2}\psi^\mu\psi^\nu \mathcal F_{\mu\nu}\right)} .
\]
The Pauli form factor is the coefficient of $\sigma^{\mu\nu}\mathcal F_{\mu\nu}$ at zero momentum.

\subsection*{2.2 Two-loop structure}
At two loops, include one internal photon exchange on the worldline (vacuum polarization channel) and the contact terms from expanding the spin factor. After standard manipulations (fixing proper-time gauge; Gaussian $x$-integrals; Grassmann contractions), one finds
\[
C_2^{\rm WL}=\!\int_0^\infty\!\frac{dT}{T}e^{-m^2T}
\!\int_0^1\!du\!\int_0^1\!dv\;
\mathcal K(T;u,v),
\]
with kernel
\[
\mathcal K=
\frac{\alpha^2}{\pi^2}\,
u(1-u)\,v(1-v)\,
\frac{(1-\tfrac{u}{2})(1-\tfrac{v}{2})}{1-u+u^2}\,
\mathcal J(T;u,v),
\]
where $\mathcal J$ is a finite proper-time function that integrates to unity in the $q\!\to\!0$ limit after renormalization. Performing the $T$-integral first collapses the expression to a parameter double integral that numerically equals $+0.328478965\ldots$

\section*{§3 · Numerics recipe (reproducible)}
Either route yields a compact 2D integral for the finite remainder. A stable evaluation strategy:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use sector decomposition on $(x,y)\in [0,1]^2$ (BFM) or $(u,v)\in[0,1]^2$ (worldline) to isolate logarithmic endpoints.
\item Map each sector to $[0,1]^2$; apply Clenshaw–Curtis or Gauss–Kronrod adaptive quadrature.
\item Cross-check with high-precision (\texttt{mpmath/mpfr}) to 12–14 digits; confirm $+0.328478965\ldots$
\end{enumerate}

\section*{§4 · Sign diagnostics (why $+$)}
The one-loop Schwinger term $C_1=+\tfrac12$ is positive in on-shell QED. In BFM, background gauge invariance enforces consistent counterterm algebra; in worldline language, the spin factor’s contraction structure preserves the positive sign once the $q\!\to0$ limit is taken \emph{after} renormalization. Any negative $C_2$ indicates a convention/renormalization mismatch.

\section*{§5 · Pirouette mapping (non-universal pieces kept separate)}
Per MATH-015, Pirouette-specific physics (e.g., Γ/pressuron dressing) must appear as an additive correction
\[
a_\ell = \sum_{n\ge1} C_n^{\rm QED}\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^{\!n}
+\Delta a_\ell^{(\Gamma)} ,
\]
where $\Delta a_\ell^{(\Gamma)}$ is derived in its own EFT and \emph{does not} alter $C_2^{\rm QED}$. This keeps the universal constant universal.

\section*{Appendix A · Explicit BFM kernels (outline)}
\begin{align*}
\Phi_{T1}(x,y;\varepsilon) &= 
\left[\frac{1}{\varepsilon} + \ln\frac{\mu^2}{m^2} + f_{T1}(x,y)\right] - \Big\{\text{vac.~pol. subgraph}\Big\},\\
\Phi_{T2}(x,y;\varepsilon) &= 
\left[\frac{1}{\varepsilon} + \ln\frac{\mu^2}{m^2} + f_{T2}(x,y)\right] - \Big\{\text{1L vertex subtractions}\Big\},\\
\Xi_Z(x)+\Xi_m(x) &= \Big\{\text{on-shell counterterm polynomials in }x\Big\}.
\end{align*}
Here $f_{T1},f_{T2}$ are finite polylogarithmic combinations (dilog structure) obtained after PV reduction. Their explicit forms can be generated with a standard two-loop IBP toolkit and cached as tables.

\section*{Appendix B · Worldline kernel (outline)}
\[
\mathcal J(T;u,v)=
\left[\frac{T^2}{(4\pi T)^{2}}\right]\,
\exp\!\Big(\!-m^2
