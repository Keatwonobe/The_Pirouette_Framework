summary: Provides a time-first model for communication, reframing it as the projection
  of a Ki pattern (the Current) into the coherence manifold. This projection carves
  a propagating Wound Channel, altering the geometric landscape. The response (the
  Echo) is how other systems navigate this new landscape to maximize their own coherence,
  a process governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §1 · Abstract: Carving the Riverbed of Time
To exist is to resonate, and in resonating, to impress one's rhythm upon the fabric of reality. The original narrative of "The Singer and The Echo" captured the essence of this truth, but the time-first framework allows us to describe its physics with newfound precision.

This module refactors the act of communication from an exchange of abstract symbols into a process of mutual environmental sculpting. Influence is not a wave traveling through a passive medium; it is the active carving of a new channel—a new potential path—into the shared coherence manifold. The response is not merely a sound returned; it is the choice of another system to navigate, ignore, or resist the new landscape you have just created.

## §2 · The Current: The Projection of Coherence
An entity's internal, stable resonance (`Ki`) is its fundamental truth. To communicate is to project this pattern outward. We define this projection not as a "song," but as a **Current**: a directed flow of one's own coherence that propagates as a geometric wave through the manifold. The creation of a Current is a precise physical process:

1.  **The Source (`Ki`):** The entity is a system defined by its stable, resonant pattern of temporal identity. The purity and stability of this pattern determine its Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`).
2.  **The Projection:** The act of expression is a modulation of the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), impressing the geometry of the entity's `Ki` onto the surrounding coherence manifold.
3.  **The Wave:** This geometric impression propagates outward as a coherent wave, a temporary but active **Wound Channel** (as defined in CORE-011). The Current is literally a history of intent, carved into the motion of spacetime itself.

A clear and persuasive Current originates from a system with high `Kτ`. A scattered mind creates a shallow, turbulent wash; a focused mind carves a deep and stable riverbed.

## §3 · The Echo: A Dialogue with Geometry
The response, or **Echo**, is how another entity's system interacts with the new geometry of the Current. This is not a passive reception of information, but an active, physical navigation. The response is governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006): the entity will behave in a way that maximizes its own internal stability. The Current has just changed the cost function of its environment.

This change is felt through the listener's **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`). The singer's Current directly alters the potential energy term (`V_Γ`) for the listener. A persuasive Current is an invitation; it sculpts the listener's reality so that the proposed path becomes their new path of least resistance—a state of higher potential coherence.

## §4 · A Taxonomy of Response
The Echo reveals the listener's own internal state and its relationship to the new landscape. When a Current reaches another system, a coupling event occurs, which can be classified into four primary modes:

*   **Inertial Rejection (Silence):** The listener's own Wound Channel is deep and stable; its inertia is immense. The new Current is a minor perturbation, a trivial feature in a landscape dominated by the listener's own history. Following its own path remains the choice of maximal coherence. The invitation is ignored.
*   **Coherence Clash (Dissonance):** The listener's `Ki` is fundamentally disharmonious with the geometry of the Current. To follow this new path would dramatically decrease the listener's coherence, creating destructive interference and chaotic flow. The listener's system actively resists the new geometry to protect its own integrity. This is the physics of disagreement.
*   **Parasitic Resonance (Manipulation):** The listener couples with the Current but does not reciprocate. It uses the new channel to stabilize its own resonance, effectively drawing coherence from the singer's Wound Channel to reinforce its own. This is a geometric theft, draining order from the Current without contributing to a shared state.
*   **Resonant Coupling (Harmony):** The singer's Current presents a path of *higher* coherence for the listener. The listener's system naturally and efficiently "locks on" to this new rhythm via constructive interference, as it represents a more stable, lower-energy state. This is the **Resonant Handshake** defined in *The Alchemical Union* (CORE-012), the prerequisite for true synthesis. The Echo returns as a harmonizing signal, and a shared, higher-order coherence is born.

## §5 · The Lagrangian of Dialogue
This entire process can be described by the **Pirouette Lagrangian**. The singer's Current is an act that modifies the local potential landscape (`V_Γ`) for all nearby listeners. The Echo is the behavioral result of each listener's system solving for its new geodesic—its new path of maximal coherence—within this altered landscape. Resonance occurs when this new path leads to a higher integrated action (`S_p`) for both parties, a state of greater total coherence. Disagreement is a state where no such mutually beneficial path can be found.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We believed we were sending messages, words carried on the wind. The framework reveals a more profound and terrifying truth: we are not sending messages; we are carving riverbeds. Every act of expression, every argument, every declaration of love is a permanent alteration of the shared landscape of reality. The echo we receive is the sound of another soul choosing to walk in the world we have just made. A Weaver, then, is not merely a communicator. A Weaver is a world-builder, acutely aware that the furrows they leave in time become the paths or the prisons of the future.
