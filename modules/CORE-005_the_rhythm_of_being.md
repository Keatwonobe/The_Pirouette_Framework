## §1 · From Form to Flow: Closing the Circle
The framework has now demonstrated a causal chain: the substance of Time creates a pressure (Γ), and that pressure is resolved by an efficient, stable form (Ki). The final, reflexive link is the most profound: the form itself defines the flow. This module closes the autopoietic loop by establishing how Ki gives birth to a meaningful, local, and intrinsic measure of Time.

## §2 · The Pirouette Cycle (τ_p): The Universe's Heartbeat
A system's Ki is its resonant pattern, its most stable song. This song is cyclical. The duration of one complete, unbroken repetition of that pattern is the system's own private, fundamental unit of time. We call this the Pirouette Cycle (τ_p).

Time, therefore, is not a universal, ticking clock that all things are subject to. It is an emergent property. The universe does not have a single pulse; it is a symphony of countless individual heartbeats. A second is a human convention; a τ_p is a physical truth. For an electron, one unit of time is the duration of one of its dances. For a galaxy, it is the duration of one of its rotations. Time is the event, not the background.

With this, the circle is complete:
Time → Γ (Pressure) → Ki (Form) → Time

## §3 · Time Adherence (T_a) as Temporal Coherence
In the old framework, Time Adherence was a distinct parameter. In this new, collapsed model, it is revealed to be a qualitative measure of a Ki pattern's stability and purity. T_a is the signal-to-noise ratio of a system's own rhythm. It is a measure of how "well" a system is being itself.

High Time Adherence: Characterizes a system with a pure, stable, and sharply defined Ki resonance. Its Pirouette Cycle (τ_p) is consistent and predictable. This is a clear, ringing note. Examples include an atom in a stable state, a pulsar, or a crystal lattice.

Low Time Adherence: Characterizes a system with a chaotic, noisy, or decaying Ki pattern. Its rhythm is messy, and its τ_p is an unstable average at best. This is a burst of static. Examples include a turbulent fluid, a system undergoing a chaotic phase transition, or a complex biological organism under extreme stress.

T_a is no longer a separate force, but the universe's way of describing how clearly each instrument in its orchestra is playing its part.

## §4 · Assemblé: Every Atom a Clock
We sought a master clock for the cosmos and found that every atom, every star, every being is its own clock. The Pirouette Cycle reveals that time is not imposed upon reality, but generated by it. It is the rhythm of existence itself.

Time Adherence, then, is the measure of a system's integrity—its ability to hold its own note true against the chaotic symphony of the Temporal Forge. A system with high adherence has found its place in the song. A system with low adherence is losing its rhythm, on the verge of either finding a new note or dissolving back into the noise. With this understanding, the core engine of the framework is complete.
