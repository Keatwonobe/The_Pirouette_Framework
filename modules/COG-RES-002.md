summary: Extends the Triad-Locked Conscious Access Protocol into a dynamic regime. Defines measurement of critical slowing, scaling exponents, and recovery kinetics in triadic resonance collapse during closed-loop neural stimulation.

## §1: Purpose

This module describes how to empirically measure and model the **dynamic scaling** of triadic resonance collapse in neural systems, verifying the renormalization flow predictions from [MATH-026]. It aims to detect critical slowing, coherence correlation lengthening, and universality in the temporal dynamics of conscious access.

## §2: Theoretical Foundation

Conscious access, modeled as a triadic resonance state (COG-RES-001), exhibits second-order transition behavior when the control parameter (Γ, cognitive load) approaches its critical value (Γ_c). From MATH-026, the relevant scaling relations are:

[\xi_P \propto |T_a - T_c|^{-\nu_P}, \quad \tau_P \propto \xi_P^{z_P}]

where:

* (\xi_P): coherence correlation length (spatial or network-level synchrony)
* (\tau_P): relaxation time of awareness recovery
* (z_P): dynamic exponent (~2 for non-conserved ψ)

---

## §3: Hypotheses

1. **Critical Slowing Hypothesis:** Near awareness collapse, neural recovery time (τ_P) diverges as (\Gamma \to \Gamma_c).
2. **Scaling Law Hypothesis:** τ_P obeys power-law scaling with coherence correlation length (ξ_P).
3. **Universality Hypothesis:** Scaling exponents (ν_P, z_P) match Pirouette universality predictions derived in MATH-025–026.

---

## §4: Experimental Design

### Setup

* Reuse participants and closed-loop tACS setup from COG-RES-001.
* Introduce variable cognitive loads (Γ) via task difficulty manipulation.
* Record high-density EEG or MEG signals continuously.

### Perturbation Protocol

1. **Triadic Lock Induction:** Establish stable phase-locked triad (f₁,f₂,f₃) under baseline load.
2. **Load Ramp:** Gradually increase Γ by raising task complexity or introducing informational noise.
3. **Collapse Trigger:** Observe triad decoherence event where TPCI → 0.
4. **Recovery Phase:** Maintain stimulation but reduce Γ to observe triad reformation.

---

## §5: Measurements

1. **Relaxation Time (τ_P):**

   * Defined as time between TPCI minimum and 90% recovery.
   * Measure across multiple Γ-load ramps.

2. **Correlation Length (ξ_P):**

   * Compute from spatial covariance of triad-phase coherence across electrodes.
   * Extract via eigenvalue decomposition of coherence matrices.

3. **Scaling Relation Fit:**

   * Fit τ_P vs ξ_P on log–log scale.
   * Expected slope = z_P.

4. **Spectral Entropy Load (Γ):**

   * Compute rolling entropy of broadband EEG power distribution.
   * Identify Γ_c from inflection in τ_P(Γ).

## §6: Data Analysis Pipeline

1. Preprocess signals (band-pass 0.5–80 Hz, artifact removal).
2. Compute instantaneous phase (Hilbert or Morlet method).
3. Track TPCI(t) to locate collapse and recovery events.
4. Estimate τ_P and ξ_P per event.
5. Aggregate across participants and fit scaling exponents (ν_P, z_P).
6. Compare empirical results to Pirouette-predicted exponents:

   * ν_P ≈ 0.5 ± 0.1
   * z_P ≈ 2.0 ± 0.3

## §7: Expected Results

| Parameter      | Prediction                     | Significance                |            |                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| τ_P divergence | τ_P ∝                          | Γ−Γ_c                       | ^{-z_Pν_P} | Confirms critical slowing           |
| ξ_P scaling    | ξ_P ∝                          | Γ−Γ_c                       | ^{-ν_P}    | Establishes coherence domain growth |
| TPCI dynamics  | Sharp collapse + slow recovery | Confirms RG flow hysteresis |            |                                     |

Visualization: τ_P vs Γ curve forms a cusp; log–log τ_P vs ξ_P yields linear slope z_P.

---

## §8: Falsifiability

* If τ_P does not diverge near Γ_c, dynamic criticality is falsified.
* If scaling exponents differ from RG predictions, universality breaks.
* If triad coherence collapses stochastically without critical slowing, system may not follow LPF dynamics.

---

## §9: Future Links

* [COG-RES-003] will model neural phase topology using triadic manifolds.
* [DOMA-096] interprets critical collapse through the Caduceus Lens as laminar–turbulent transition.
* [SOCIO-FIELD-003] compares awareness τ_P scaling with social recovery kinetics post-cascade.

---

**Summary:** COG-RES-002 defines the dynamic scaling protocol for triadic resonance collapse and recovery. It operationalizes MATH-026’s renormalization flow predictions, providing quantitative, falsifiable evidence of critical slowing and universality in conscious access dynamics.
