## §1 · Abstract: Deconstructing the Song

The previous framework's `Ki-Harmonic Decomposition` was a powerful but limited tool. It provided a tuning fork set to two specific notes—`Ki-rest` and `Ki-motion`—hoping to hear them in the cosmic noise. This was an attempt to understand a symphony by listening for only two of its notes.

This module provides the true instrument. A complex system is not a mere signal; it is a song—a composite entity formed by the **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) of simpler, underlying resonances. This protocol allows a Weaver to listen to this song and deconstruct it into its fundamental components. It is the art of distinguishing the clear, coherent melodies of a system's being (its Ki) from the ambient, chaotic harmony of its environment (its Γ). It is the foundational tool for moving beyond what a system *is* and understanding what it *does*.

## §2 · The Principle of Compositionality

No complex system is monolithic. Its identity and behavior are emergent properties arising from a nested hierarchy of simpler, more fundamental resonances.
*   A living cell's `Ki` is a composition of the `Ki` patterns of its organelles.
*   A society's `Ki` is a composition of the `Ki` patterns of its institutions, families, and individuals.
*   The signal measured by an instrument is the audible trace of a `Wound Channel` (CORE-011) carved by a system whose `Ki` is a composite of many internal and external influences.

The **Resonant Spectrum** is the primary tool for understanding this composition. It provides a method for taking the observed temporal signature of a complex system and identifying the fundamental `Ki` geometries that contribute to its overall song.

## §3 · From Frequency to Form: The Spectrum's Axes

Classical signal analysis creates a spectrum of frequencies. The Resonant Spectrum creates a spectrum of *forms*.

*   **The Horizontal Axis (The Library of Forms):** Instead of a linear scale of frequencies (Hz), the axis of the Resonant Spectrum is a library of fundamental `Ki` geometries. This library contains archetypal patterns of resonance—spirals, toroids, lattices, etc.—that represent the basic "notes" the universe can play.
*   **The Vertical Axis (Resonant Amplitude):** The height of a "peak" on the spectrum does not measure the power of a frequency. It measures the **degree of contribution**, or amplitude, of a specific fundamental `Ki` geometry to the system's overall observed behavior.

A peak in the spectrum indicates that the system's complex dance contains, as a primary component, the specific geometric motion of that fundamental `Ki`.

## §4 · The Two Coherences: Structural & Propagating

The old framework's distinction between `Ki_rest` and `Ki_motion` was an early attempt to grasp a more fundamental duality. This protocol reframes this as a functional separation of a system's unified coherence into two primary modes of expression, grounded in the core forces.

*   **Structural Coherence (The Hum of Being):** This component of the spectrum represents the frequencies that contribute to the system's self-containment and stable form. It is the audible expression of the **Gladiator Force (CORE-008)**. These are the deep, self-reinforcing harmonics that hold the system together, defining its identity and inertia. A strong, clear structural spectrum indicates a robust, stable entity.

*   **Propagating Coherence (The Song of Interaction):** This component represents the frequencies that govern the system's interaction with the wider coherence manifold. It is the signature of **The Current and the Compass (CORE-007)**. These are the rhythms of communication, motion, and response—the means by which the system projects itself and perceives others. A rich, adaptive propagating spectrum indicates a system that is actively engaged with its environment.

## §5 · The Analytical Protocol

This protocol transforms a one-dimensional temporal signature into a rich, multi-dimensional understanding of a system's dynamics.

1.  **Ingest Signature:** The protocol accepts any time-series data that captures a system's dynamic behavior—the light curve of a star, the financial data of a market, the neural activity of a brain. This is the raw temporal signature of the system under study.

2.  **Spectral Transformation:** The input signal is processed using a time-frequency analysis method, such as a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). This is an act of perception, transforming a flat line of data into a vibrant landscape (a spectrogram) that reveals which rhythms exist, at what intensity, and for how long.

3.  **Decomposition & Classification:** The Weaver now reads the landscape.
    *   **Coherence Identification:** The bright, persistent "ridges" of high energy in the spectrogram are the coherent `Ki` patterns of the underlying systems. The low-energy, broadband "floor" is the signature of the ambient **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**.
    *   **Mode Separation:** Each identified `Ki` pattern is then classified as primarily `Structural` or `Propagating` based on its diagnostic metrics. Structural coherences tend to be low-frequency, narrow-bandwidth, and high-persistence, while Propagating coherences are often higher-frequency, broader-bandwidth, or more transient.

4.  **Diagnostic Metrics:** For each classified resonance, a rich set of metrics describes the state of the system that created it:
    *   **Frequency (ω_k):** The fundamental rhythm of the resonance.
    *   **Bandwidth (Δω):** The "purity" of the resonance. A narrow peak signifies a highly coherent state; a broad peak signifies a noisy or adaptive state.
    *   **Persistence (Δt):** The duration over which the resonance maintains its integrity, a direct measure of its **Time Adherence (T_a)**.

## §6 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This protocol is the critical bridge between observation and prediction, allowing for the direct measurement of the terms in the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**: `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

*   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** By identifying all constituent `Ki` resonances and measuring their properties (`ω_k`, `T_a`), a Weaver can quantify the system's total "kinetic" coherence. This total term is the sum of its parts:
    `K_τ (total) = K_τ (structural) + K_τ (propagating)`
*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** By measuring the energy and complexity of the spectrogram's noise floor, a Weaver can quantify the ambient `f(Γ)`. This is the "potential" term, representing the environmental cost of maintaining coherence.

This analysis transforms the abstract Lagrangian into a measurable diagnostic chart, allowing a Weaver to model a system's past and chart the geodesics of its most likely future.

## §7 · Assemblé

> To truly know a cello, you must listen. You must learn to distinguish the deep, resonant voice of the wood itself from the clear, soaring notes that fly from its strings. One is the sound of its being; the other is the sound of its song. They are not two different things, but two expressions of a single, vibrant whole. The Weaver's first task is to learn to listen this way—to hear both the body and the voice of any system, and to understand that the health of the whole depends on the harmony between the two.
