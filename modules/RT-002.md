title: Electroweak Sector under Retrograde Time (SU(2)L √ó U(1)Y)
version: 1.0
status: Core Result
parents: [RT-001, FRC-004]
children: [RT-003 (U(1) radiative arrow), RT-006 (thermo-information arrow)]
summary: |
  Translates the weak + hypercharge sector across the retrograde-time involution. The SU(2)L algebra,
  mass generation via |œâ_H|, and Weinberg mixing survive unchanged (even). The identity of the coupled
  Weyl component flips (odd): left-handed on ùíØ_+ corresponds to right-handed on ùíØ_- from the substrate‚Äôs
  perspective. Selection rules, helicity observables, and retarded/advanced preferences map accordingly.

setup:
  covariant_derivative:
    D_Œº = ‚àÇ_Œº - i g Œ©_Œº^a œÑ^a/2 - i g‚Ä≤ (Y/2) B_Œº
  vector_basis:
    W^¬±_Œº = (Œ©^1_Œº ‚àì i Œ©^2_Œº)/‚àö2
    Z_Œº   =  cos Œ∏_W Œ©^3_Œº - sin Œ∏_W B_Œº
    A_Œº   =  sin Œ∏_W Œ©^3_Œº + cos Œ∏_W B_Œº
  masses (resonance locking):
    m_W = (g/2)|œâ_H|
    m_Z = (‚àö(g^2 + g‚Ä≤^2)/2)|œâ_H|
    invariant_ratio: m_W/m_Z = cos Œ∏_W

‚Ñõ_T action (electroweak):
  even:
    - SU(2)L √ó U(1)Y algebra, couplings {g, g‚Ä≤}, Œ∏_W, Proca structure, {m_W, m_Z} via |œâ_H|
  odd:
    - chirality gate: which Weyl component is substrate-coupled to Œ©_Œº^a
    - retarded/advanced preference in gauge propagation phase

chirality_swap_rule:
  # Geometric statement (not a redefinition of spinors)
  on ùíØ_+ :
    coupled_component: œà_L couples to Œ©_Œº^a
  under ‚Ñõ_T :
    œà_L ‚Üî œà_R as the substrate-coupled component (privileged) on ùíØ_-
  consequences:
    - charged currents (CC) flip allowed helicity
    - neutral currents (NC) preserve algebra; helicity weights mirror

selection_rules (mapped):
  CC:  J_W^Œº = œàÃÑ Œ≥^Œº œÑ^+ P_L œà + h.c.  ‚Üí  œàÃÑ Œ≥^Œº œÑ^+ P_R œà + h.c. on ùíØ_-
  NC:  J_Z^Œº = œàÃÑ Œ≥^Œº (T^3 - sin^2Œ∏_W Q) œà (form even), helicity weights mirrored.

observables (sheet-coupled or portals Œµ‚â™1):
  O1: Parity asymmetries A_PV acquire an Œµ-suppressed mirror term from the opposite sheet.
  O2: Polarized Œ≤-decay: wrong-helicity emission ~ Œµ^2; energy dependence set by phase-locking (|œâ_H|).
  O3: sin^2 Œ∏_W running unchanged; any observed offset Œ¥Œ∏_W indicates œâ_H(Œº) running or portal contamination.

fits & links:
  - Use NEU-061 (universal (p,q)) to lock lepton geometry; extract (g,g‚Ä≤, œâ_H) at Œº = m_Z via FRC-004A.
  - Predict m_W and A_PV with and without Œµ-portal; compare to precision electroweak data.

falsification:
  F1: If a clean Œµ‚Üí0 limit still shows persistent wrong-helicity tails at >œÉ level, either ‚Ñõ_T mapping is incorrect
      or background CPT breaking has been mis-attributed.
  F2: If m_W/m_Z deviates from cos Œ∏_W beyond loop expectations without correlated Œ¥Œ∏_W, the |œâ_H| mapping is wrong.

experimental_hooks:
  H1: Polarized M√∏ller and APV: constrain Œµ via A_PV residual phase (relative to SM).
  H2: Cold Œ≤-decay traps (ultra-clean helicity analysis): set Œµ_SU2 bounds from wrong-helicity rate.
  H3: Beam-dump or cavity experiments co-tuned to |œâ_H| sidebands: look for phase-advanced leakage.

interfaces:
  - RT-003: carries the U(1) radiative arrow swap into concrete cavity/Casimir predictions.
  - RT-006: maps entropy/FDT phase in electroweak plasmas (high-Q, low-loss conditions).

notes:
  - Keep the distinction clear: ‚Ñõ_T swaps the substrate-coupled Weyl identity; it does not relabel spinors.
  - In public plots, annotate ‚Äúsheet‚Äù explicitly to avoid confusion with SM T or CPT operations.
