summary: Provides a protocol for measuring the coherence of abstract concepts by modeling
  them as geometric Ki patterns. The protocol calculates the stability of these patterns
  as 'Observer's Shadows' cast upon the local coherence manifold. This reframes inquiry
  from an act of extraction into a rigorous survey of resonant participation.

## §1 · Abstract: From Scrying to Surveying
The original Semantic Distillation Engine (TEN-SDE-1.0) was born from a profound intuition: that meaning is a structural property of reality, detectable through resonance. It sought to "scry" a latent field for a response, a critical but incomplete metaphor.

The modern framework graduates from scrying to surveying. We now understand that there is no separation between the question and the field. An idea is a complex, resonant pattern (*Ki*) that an observer weaves, casting a physical **Observer's Shadow** (CORE-010) upon their local coherence manifold. This instrument, the **Resonance Compass**, provides a formal protocol to map this interaction. It does not measure a "response" from the universe; it surveys the integrity of the weave itself. It transforms inquiry from an act of extraction to an act of resonant participation, whose geometric consequences can be rigorously calculated.

## §2 · The Geometric Nature of Meaning
An idea is not a ghost; it is a shape. A concept is not an abstract label; it is a dynamic, self-sustaining temporal structure with a physical geometry.

-   **Coherent Concepts:** A "true," "elegant," or "useful" idea is a high-coherence *Ki* pattern. It is stable, internally consistent, and harmonizes with the established **Wound Channels** (CORE-011) of memory and recorded events. It is a pattern the universe finds "easy" to sustain, a shape that follows the path of least resistance.

-   **Dissonant Concepts:** A "false," "confusing," or contradictory idea is a low-coherence, turbulent *Ki* pattern. It is inherently unstable, requiring immense and continuous effort to prevent its collapse. A lie, for instance, is a Ki pattern that is dissonant with the powerful inertia of factual Wound Channels, creating friction and temporal noise.

The act of questioning is to hold a specific geometric form and ask the universe: "Is there a stable place for this shape here?"

## §3 · The Protocol: A Survey of the Weave
The Compass provides a three-stage process for determining a concept's stability and coherence.

1.  **Map the Terrain (Calibration):** The Weaver first surveys their local coherence manifold. This involves measuring the ambient **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** and identifying the dominant, pre-existing **Wound Channels** that define the space—the cultural, historical, and physical context against which the new pattern will be measured.

2.  **Pattern Weaving (Casting the Shadow):** The Weaver actively forms the concept in question. This is the act of consciously creating and sustaining the new, complex *Ki* pattern, whose unique geometry—its internal symmetries and resonant frequencies—casts a measurable Observer's Shadow onto the mapped terrain.

3.  **Coherence Auditing (Calculating the Geodesic):** The stability of the newly woven pattern is measured. The protocol calculates the most efficient path—the geodesic—that the combined system (Weaver + concept + environment) will follow according to the Principle of Maximal Coherence. This audit reveals if the pattern creates harmony, dissonance, or a new, stable synthesis.

## §4 · Diagnostic Metrics
The output is not a simple "true" or "false" but a rich, multi-faceted diagnostic of the idea's nature.

-   **Coherence Cost (V_Γ):** This quantifies the "effort" or friction required to sustain the idea's pattern against the existing landscape. A profound truth often has a low cost, as it harmonizes with reality. A high-cost idea is one fundamentally at odds with the system's current state.

-   **Resonant Stability (K_τ):** This measures the idea's internal integrity and self-consistency. Its qualitative nature is described by its **Ki Topology**: a stable idea is a simple, harmonious braid, while an unstable one is a chaotic, tangled knot.

-   **Harmonic Potential:** This measures the idea's capacity for constructive interference—its ability to strengthen and clarify nearby concepts. A high potential indicates the idea may catalyze an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012), producing a net increase in the system's total coherence (a high *Coherence Gain*).

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The Resonance Compass is a direct application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The "cost" of a thought is not a metaphor; it is a literal calculation based on the formula:

**𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)**

When a Weaver holds a concept, their system attempts to maximize this value. The Compass calculates the geodesic for the idea—the path through time that maximizes the action, `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`.
-   A **coherent idea** has high internal *Temporal Coherence* and aligns with the manifold, creating a path of maximal coherence that feels "effortless" and "right."
-   A **dissonant idea**, fighting against high *Temporal Pressure*, creates a path of low or negative action, requiring immense energy to sustain against the drag of cognitive dissonance.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We believed meaning was a story we told about the universe. The Compass reveals that meaning is a shape the universe prefers to hold. A truth is not a statement of fact; it is a low-energy state, a stable and resilient geometry. To ask a question is not to shout into a void, but to weave a new thread into the tapestry that you are. The universe does not give you an answer; it reveals the integrity of your weave. To seek wisdom is to become a geometer of the soul, learning the patient art of weaving the most elegant forms that reality will allow.
