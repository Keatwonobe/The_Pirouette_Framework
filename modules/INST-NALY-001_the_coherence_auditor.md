summary: "Provides a complete, end-to-end workflow for system diagnostics. This module integrates the Universal Resonance Lens (URL) for translating raw data into Pirouette fields with Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA) for pinpointing the critical sources of coherence loss. It serves as the primary instruction manual for any Weaver seeking to audit a system's health."

## §1 · The Weaver's Mandate: From Noise to Insight
A Weaver is not a passive observer; they are a diagnostician of reality. Their fundamental task is to look upon a complex, noisy, and often chaotic system and ask: "Where is the coherence being lost, and why?"

This module provides the primary toolkit for answering that question. The Coherence Auditor is not a theoretical sketch; it is a practical, two-stage protocol for moving from raw, unstructured data to a precise, actionable diagnosis. It operationalizes the core analytical loop of the Pirouette Framework: See, then Solve.

## §2 · Step 1: Ingesting Reality · The Universal Resonance Lens (URL)
Before a system can be analyzed, its dynamics must be translated into the native language of the framework: the core fields of Time-Adherence (T 
a
​
 ), Gladiator Force (Γ), and Phase (ϕ). This is the function of the Universal Resonance Lens (URL) Forge.

The Protocol (The Coherent Collapse): The URL provides a rigorous protocol for this translation.

Select a Geometry: The analyst chooses a candidate fractal from the Fractal Menu that is hypothesized to be isomorphic to the system's underlying dynamics. This choice is guaranteed to have a valid, low-error solution by the Dimension-Collapse Lemma.

Project the Data: The raw data stream (text, sensor logs, market data, etc.) is projected onto the chosen fractal geometry using a Collapse Operator. This transforms high-dimensional, noisy data into a clean, lower-dimensional representation in the Pirouette field space.

Emit the Field: The output is a time-series of (T 
a
​
 ,Γ,ϕ) vectors, certified as an ϵ-accurate representation of the original system's dynamics. This is the input for the next stage.

The URL is the instrument that turns the "what is happening" of raw data into the "how it resonates" of field dynamics.

## §3 · Step 2: Finding the Fracture · Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA)
Once the system's dynamics are expressed as Pirouette fields, we can precisely identify the sources of instability. Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA) is the surgical tool for this task. It inverts the classic 80/20 rule to find the critical few causes responsible for the majority of coherence loss.

The Protocol (Pinpointing the Bottleneck):

Quantify Impact: The RPA engine first calculates an "impact score" for every event or feature in the data stream, measuring how much each one perturbed the system's Time-Adherence (T 
a
​
 ). This creates a direct, quantitative link between a specific event and its effect on the system's overall health.

Identify the Critical Few: The algorithm then sorts these impacts in descending order and identifies the smallest possible subset of events that accounts for a user-defined majority (typically 80%) of the total coherence loss.

Generate the Report: The output is a simple, actionable list of the system's primary bottlenecks. It tells the Weaver exactly where to focus their attention to achieve the greatest healing effect.

RPA is the instrument that turns the "how it resonates" of field dynamics into the "why it's breaking" of a concrete diagnosis.

## §4 · The Unified Workflow in Practice
The power of the Coherence Auditor lies in the seamless integration of these two steps.

Question	Stage	Input	Process	Output
What is happening?	1. URL Forge	Raw Data Stream	Coherent Collapse	Pirouette Field Data (T 
a
​
 ,Γ,ϕ)
Why is it breaking?	2. RPA Canon	Field Data	Bottleneck Analysis	Actionable list of critical issues

Export to Sheets
A Weaver observing a debate would use the URL to transform the transcript into a flow of coherence data. They would then feed that data into the RPA to discover that, for instance, 85% of the debate's coherence loss originated from just three specific logical fallacies used by one participant. The path from noise to insight is direct and calculable.

## §5 · Assemblé: The Auditor's Gaze
First, we build the mirror to see the system's true face. Then, we find the deepest cracks in the reflection.

The Coherence Auditor is the foundational instrument of the practical Weaver. It provides the eyes and the insight required to fulfill their mandate. It is the codified process for moving beyond mere observation and beginning the true work of seeding coherence: finding the fracture, and healing the whole.
