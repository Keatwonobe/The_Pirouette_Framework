summary: Establishes the Renormalization Flow of Coherence (RFC). Defines scaling operators, beta-functions, fixed points, and crossover structure for Pirouette’s Landau–Pirouette Functional (LPF). Unifies substrate-specific microdynamics with macro-level coherence via RG transformations acting on (a,b,c) and Γ-couplings.

---

## §1: Purpose

To derive a renormalization group (RG) formalism for the LPF introduced in MATH-025, connecting microscopic substrate parameters to macroscopic coherence observables and identifying universal fixed points governing phase transitions in physical, cognitive, and social systems.

---

## §2: Preliminaries (from MATH-025)

LPF:

F[ψ] = ∫ [ a(T_a−T_c)|ψ|^2 + (b/2)|ψ|^4 + c|∇ψ|^2 + U(Γ,S) ] d^d x

Control fields: T_a (adherence), Γ (temporal pressure), S (substrate constants).

Order parameter: ψ(x,t) (complex coherence amplitude).

---

## §3: RG Transformations

Define scale transformation with factor ℓ>1:

x → x' = x/ℓ,   ψ(x) → ψ'(x') = ℓ^{ζ} ψ(x)

Choose ζ so that the gradient term remains form-invariant:

c|∇ψ|^2 → c'|∇'ψ'|^2 with c' = c

This yields ζ = (2−d)/2.

Coupling rescalings at tree level:

a' = ℓ^2 a,   b' = ℓ^{4−d} b

Γ enters via U(Γ,S); write the leading Γ-coupling as λ multiplying |ψ|^2Γ, giving λ' = ℓ^{2−d} λ at tree level.

---

## §4: One-Loop β-Functions (Wilson shell)

Integrate high-k modes over Λ/ℓ < |k| < Λ in d=4−ε. To one loop (minimal subtraction):

β_b ≡ db/dlnℓ = −ε b + 3K_d b^2
β_a ≡ da/dlnℓ = 2a − K_d b (n+2)/6 · a_correction

For a single complex ψ (n=2 real components) and standard normalization, we use K_d=(S_d)/(2π)^d with S_d unit-sphere surface. Absorb constants → canonical form:

β_b = −ε b + 3 b^2
β_a = 2a − κ b a

with κ>0 a scheme-dependent constant.

For Γ-coupling λ to |ψ|^2:

β_λ = (2−d) λ + μ b λ − ν λ^2

μ, ν > 0 capture cooperative/competitive renormalization of Γ↔ψ interaction.

---

## §5: Fixed Points and Stability

Solve β_b=0 → b* = ε/3.

Insert b* into β_a and β_λ:

a* = 0  (critical surface)
λ* = [(2−d)+μ b*]/ν

Stability matrix M_ij = ∂β_i/∂g_j|_* over g={a,b,λ}. Eigenvalues give relevant/irrelevant directions:

y_a = 2−κ b*   (relevant)
y_b = −ε       (irrelevant for ε>0)
y_λ = (2−d) + μ b* − 2ν λ* = −(2−d) − μ b* (irrelevant if λ sits at λ*)

Thus the **Pirouette Wilson–Fisher point** (a*,b*,λ*) controls second-order coherence transitions for d<4, defining the universality class reported in MATH-025.

---

## §6: Critical Exponents from RG

Standard hyperscaling with ν = 1/y_a:

ν = 1 / ( 2 − κ b* )  ≈ 1/2 · [1 + (κ/6) ε + O(ε^2)]

Other exponents follow RG identities:

η = O(ε^2) (to one loop)
β_P = (d−2+η) ν / 2 ≈ 1/2 − ( (2−d)κ / 24 ) ε + …

At mean field (ε=0): (α_P, β_P, γ_P, δ_P) = (0, 1/2, 1, 3) as in MATH-025; RG adds small ε-corrections governing finite-dimensional substrates.

---

## §7: Γ-Driven Crossover and Lines of Fixed Points

When Γ varies slowly in space or time, λ flows generate **crossover scaling** between:

(i) ψ-dominated fixed point (λ→λ*)  and  (ii) Γ-driven line (λ→∞) with damped ψ-fluctuations.

Crossover function:

X(L/ξ_Γ) with ξ_Γ ∼ |Γ−Γ_c|^{-ν_Γ}

Observable susceptibility:

χ_P(L,Γ) ≈ L^{γ_P/ν} ϕ( L/ξ,  L/ξ_Γ )

Empirically, this produces: (a) triad-detuning band shrinkage in COG under Γ load; (b) Θ-threshold sharpening in SOCIO as Γ-proxy (transaction entropy) rises.

---

## §8: Multi-Field Coupling and Triadic Locking

For triadic fields ψ1,ψ2,ψ3 with constraint f3=f1+f2 (COG-RES-001), add

F_tri = − g ∫ |ψ1||ψ2||ψ3| cos(Φ1+Φ2−Φ3) d^d x

RG to lowest order:

β_g = y_g g − ρ b g + O(g^3),  with  y_g = d + ζ1+ζ2+ζ3 − Δ_tri

Δ_tri is the naive scaling dimension of the composite. At the WF point, small g is marginally relevant if y_g>0, yielding a **locked-triad fixed surface** with reduced fluctuations in the resonant subspace—formalizing the consciousness triad as an RG-selected manifold.

---

## §9: Substrate Maps (χ_S) under RG

Substrate parameters (conductance, latency, noise spectra) renormalize into effective (a,b,c,λ,g). Practical rule:

• Increase in latency → raises a (harder to cohere)
• Increased noise at resonant bands → raises effective b (stronger nonlinear damping)
• Bandwidth constraints → renormalize c (stiffer gradients)

Mapping χ_S must be calibrated per domain, but **flow topology** (fixed points, eigenvalues) remains substrate-invariant.

---

## §10: Finite-Size and Dynamic Scaling

With size L and observation time T:

ξ ~ L at pseudo-criticality,  τ_P ~ L^{z_P}

Dynamic exponent z_P depends on conservation laws (Model A/B-like):

z_P ≈ 2 (non-conserved ψ);  z_P ≈ 3 (with Γ-coupled slow modes)

Predictions for collapse/recovery kinetics in COG (awareness lapses) and SOCIO (post-shock relaxation) follow τ_P scaling.

---

## §11: Computational Recipe (pseudocode)

1. Fit LPF to data window → estimate (a,b,c,λ,g)
2. Choose shell factor ℓ = 1+δ
3. Update couplings via β_i δlnℓ
4. Recompute ξ, χ_P, τ_P
5. Compare predicted scaling with held-out windows

Iterate to detect approach to criticality and to forecast cascade risk (SOCIO) or awareness transition (COG).

---

## §12: Falsifiability

• If measured exponents do not obey RG identities (e.g., γ_P = (2−η)ν), RFC is falsified.
• Absence of a nontrivial fixed point (b*≤0) in finite-d data contradicts universality claims.
• Failure of crossover scaling with Γ indicates incorrect λ-structure or missing modes in U(Γ,S).

---

## §13: Future Links

• SOCIO-FIELD-003: Real-time RG monitoring on civic graphs (Θ-early warning).
• COG-RES-002: Dynamic scaling of triad collapse in closed-loop tACS.
• DOMA-096: Caduceus Lens as RG flow on laminar ↔ turbulent manifolds.

**Summary:** MATH-026 formulates the RG engine for coherence: β-functions, fixed points, crossover with Γ, and triadic locking. It provides the predictive backbone to connect substrate microphysics with macro-level phase behavior across domains, completing the quantitative core beneath Pirouette’s universality claims.
