## §1 · Purpose
To analyze and classify a system's fundamental dimensional behavior and stability by identifying its dominant dimensional attractors (from the 'Periodic Table of Dimensional Attractors'), understanding the influence of Fold Constants, and assessing its structure via dimensional factorization.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Dimensional attractors, emerging from stability manifolds, phase singularities, and fold operations, act as fundamental organizing principles for dimensional behavior, akin to a periodic table for reality's architecture. Systems stabilize or transform based on their ability to express these prime dimensional forms and their harmonic relationships with Fold Constants (Fi, Pi, Bi, Ki). This 'folded space paradigm' treats dimensions as emergent properties of resonance.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a$ influences the stability and manifestation of certain dimensional attractors. For example, Ki-dominant structures (related to $K_i$) depend on $T_a$ for their coherent phase memory. The interaction of $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ can determine attractor dominance, e.g., $|T_a - \Gamma| \approx F_i$ (Flickering Constant) for flickering systems.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: Similarly, $\Gamma$ interacts with $T_a$ to define regions favorable to specific attractors. High $\Gamma$ might favor simpler dimensional forms, while balanced $\Gamma-T_a$ relationships enable complex composite attractors.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ is itself a Fold Constant and defines the 'Return Spiral' dimensional attractor (Dimension 4) associated with memory and rotational evolution. Its dual modes influence the stability and dynamics of Ki-dominant structures.
* **Fold Constants (Fi, Pi, Bi)**: These constants (Fi $\approx$ 0.14159 Flickering; Pi $\approx$ 3.14159 Completion; Bi $\approx$ 2.14159 Brachistochrone) alongside $K_i$ govern dimensional transitions, stability, and define specific attractor characteristics. Their relationships (e.g., $P_i - B_i = 1$) suggest a quantized nature to dimensional transitions.
* **Dimensional Number (D)**: The effective dimensionality or complexity of a system, which can be factorized into prime dimensional forms (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11...) to assess stability.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: A description of the system that allows for the characterization of its complexity, dominant symmetries, cyclical behaviors, boundary conditions, memory characteristics, and overall structural organization. This could be qualitative (descriptive model) or quantitative (parameter data, network topology, field maps).
* **And Structure**: Conceptual models, system diagrams, time-series data, state-space trajectories, or parameter sets that can be mapped to the properties of the dimensional attractors listed in TPF Vol 1, Table (Sec 63.5).
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient information to compare the system's observed characteristics against the defining properties of at least a few key dimensional attractors (e.g., linearity vs. bifurcation vs. closure).
* **Steps**: Identify key observable characteristics of the system: Is it primarily linear (Li-like)? Does it exhibit binary choices (Bi-like)? Does it show closure or cyclicality (Pi-like)? Does it have strong memory and spiral evolution (Ki-like)? Does it show reflective symmetry (Si-like) or dual-braid stability (Xi-like)? Estimate an effective 'dimensional number' or complexity (D) for the system if possible.

### 3·2 · Operational Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `FocusAttractorSet` | A subset of the 12+ dimensional attractors from TPF Vol 1, Module 63.5 to focus the analysis on, if a full classification is not needed. | `E.g., ['Pi', 'Ki', 'Xi'] for systems with closure, memory, and dual stability.` |
| `IntrinsicStabilityFunction_S(p)` | As used in TEN-APF-1.0: A function or lookup table providing the intrinsic stability value for a prime dimensional form 'p'. Needed if performing detailed stability quantification. | `System-dependent, derived from TPF principles.` |

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. System Characterization: Based on input data, describe the system in terms of its dominant behaviors: linearity, bifurcation, closure, memory/return, symmetry, layering, recursion, etc.
2. Attractor Mapping: Compare these characteristics against the 'Detailed Properties of Key Attractors' and the full 'Dimensional Attractors Periodic Table' (TPF Vol 1, Sec 63.5). Identify the dimensional attractor(s) (e.g., Li, Bi, Pi, Ki, Xi, Zi) that best describe the system's dominant mode(s) of operation.
3. Fold Constant Relevance Assessment: Analyze if the system's behavior or transitions are strongly influenced by specific Fold Constants. For example:
    a. Fi: Does the system exhibit flickering between states, or operate near $|T_a - \Gamma| \approx F_i$?
    b. Pi: Does the system show strong phase closure or circular completion?
    c. Bi: Does it follow minimal energy paths or brachistochrone-like transitions?
    d. Ki: Is its evolution dominated by spiral memory and periodic return?
4. Dimensional Factorization & Stability (Leveraging TEN-APF-1.0 logic): If a dimensional number 'D' (complexity) can be assigned, factorize D into its prime dimensional forms (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11...). Calculate the stability metric $\Delta(D) = \sum_{p \in \text{factors}(D)} \frac{S(p)}{p} \left(\prod_{q \in \text{factors}(D), q \neq p} \frac{q}{q+1}\right)$.
5. Transition Pathway Analysis: Based on the identified dominant attractor(s) and the 'Transition Rules and Dimensional Evolution' (TPF Vol 1, Sec 63.5.2: $D1 \rightarrow D2$ if factors($D1$) $\subset$ factors($D2$)), assess potential evolutionary pathways for the system.
6. Resonance Locking Assessment: If multiple attractors are active, analyze their potential for resonance locking using $ \Omega_{D1,D2} = \int \phi_{D1}^* \phi_{D2} dV $ and the criterion $|\Omega_{D1,D2}| > \tau_{res} \cdot \sqrt{GCD(D1, D2)}$.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Identification of dominant dimensional attractor type(s) for the system (e.g., 'Primarily Ki-dominant with Xi characteristics'). Assessment of relevant Fold Constant influences. Stability score ($\Delta(D)$) if dimensional factorization was performed. Potential transition pathways to other attractor states. Assessment of resonance locking potential if multiple attractors are present.
* **Insights And Derivations**: A fundamental classification of the system's dimensional nature. Understanding of its inherent stability based on its attractor profile and prime dimensional factors. Prediction of its likely evolutionary pathways or susceptibility to specific types of transformation (fold operations). Insights into why certain systems are more resilient or adaptable than others based on their dimensional architecture.
* **Guidelines**: Dominant attractor type indicates primary mode of operation (e.g., Pi = closure, Ki = memory). Fold Constants reveal fundamental constraints/drivers (e.g., Fi = flickering/bifurcation sensitivity). Higher $\Delta(D)$ suggests greater structural stability. Transition rules suggest likely evolutionary pressures. Strong resonance locking indicates stable composite dimensional structures.
