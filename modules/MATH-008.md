summary: "Provides the formal mathematical definition of Time-Adherence (T_a) as a signal-to-noise functional. This module introduces a stochastic model for environmental noise and derives a Pirouette-style fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which proves that a system's coherence (T_a) is inversely related to the spectral density of the noise it experiences. It establishes a firm, quantitative link between micro-fluctuations and macroscopic stability."

## §1 · Abstract: The Signal in the Noise
A rhythm is only meaningful in contrast to the silence or noise that surrounds it. The concept of Time-Adherence (T_a), the measure of a system's resonant integrity, has thus far been treated as an intrinsic property. This module provides its formal mathematical foundation, defining it not as an absolute quality, but as a signal-to-noise ratio.

We will model the impact of a noisy environment (Gamma fluctuations) on a system's Ki rhythm using a stochastic differential equation (SDE). From this, we will derive the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem—a relationship analogous to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in statistical mechanics. This theorem will prove that the degradation of a system's T_a is directly proportional to the amount of environmental noise it absorbs, placing the concept of coherence on a firm, statistical, and measurable footing.

## §2 · Formal Definition of Time-Adherence (T_a)
A system's Ki rhythm, the periodic orbit phi^*(t) with period tau_p derived in MATH-004, is its "signal." Any real-world system, however, is subject to stochastic fluctuations from its environment. Its actual path, phi(t), is a combination of this pure signal and a noise component.

We can decompose the total power of the system's resonance over one cycle into the power of the fundamental periodic mode and the power contained in all other fluctuations. Time-Adherence T_a is formally defined as the ratio of these powers:

T_a[phi] = (Power in fundamental mode phi^*) / (Total power in measured path phi)

T_a is a value between 0 and 1.

T_a = 1: A perfectly coherent system with zero noise. Its path phi(t) is identical to its ideal periodic orbit phi^*(t).

T_a = 0: A system completely overwhelmed by noise, with no discernible rhythm.

This definition turns T_a from a qualitative concept into a computable functional that can be estimated from real-world time-series data.

## §3 · Modeling a Noisy Environment
We model the environmental noise as stochastic perturbations eta(t) of the Temporal Pressure Gamma. This noise buffets the system's Ki rhythm. The evolution of the system's phase phi is no longer a simple deterministic equation, but a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the Langevin type:

d(phi)/dt = f(phi) + sigma(phi) * eta(t)

Where:

f(phi) is the "drift" term, representing the deterministic forces derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian (-dV/d(phi)). It pushes the system back towards its stable orbit.

sigma(phi) * eta(t) is the "diffusion" term. eta(t) is a white noise process, and sigma(phi) is the magnitude of the noise's effect.

This equation describes a system constantly trying to maintain its rhythm while being kicked around by its environment.

## §4 · The Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem
We now derive the relationship between the noise and the loss of coherence. The degradation of Time-Adherence, Delta T_a, is the amount of power that "leaks" from the fundamental mode into other frequencies due to the noise.

For a system near its stable orbit, we can analyze this SDE using linear response theory. The result is a relationship between the spectral density of the noise, S_eta(omega), and the loss of coherence.

The Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem states:

Delta T_a is proportional to integral of [ S_eta(omega) * |chi(omega)|^2 ] d(omega)

Where:

Delta T_a = 1 - T_a.

S_eta(omega) is the power spectrum of the environmental noise eta(t). It tells us how much noise power is present at each frequency omega.

chi(omega) is the susceptibility of the system. It describes how sensitive the system's Ki rhythm is to being pushed at a given frequency. A system is most susceptible to noise that matches its own natural resonant frequencies.

This theorem is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. It provides a direct, causal link: the amount of coherence a system "dissipates" (Delta T_a) is determined by the spectrum of the environmental fluctuations (S_eta) it experiences, filtered through its own internal sensitivity (chi).

## §5 · Assemblé: The Rhythm of Resilience
A system's resilience is not measured by its strength, but by its rhythm. We have now proven that this rhythm's integrity, its Time-Adherence, is a precise measure of its relationship with the surrounding chaos.

The Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem gives us a profound diagnostic tool. It proves that stability is a statistical property. To maintain coherence is to be a good filter—to be able to absorb or deflect the environmental noise that exists at frequencies dissonant with one's own, while remaining responsive to the currents that matter. A system does not break because the force against it is too great, but because the noise is too loud. T_a is the measure of how well a system can still hear its own song in the middle of the storm.

## [Global Assumptions for MATH-004..010]

Function spaces:
- State variable φ(t) lives in H^1_per([0, τ_p]) with periodic boundary conditions.
- K_τ(φ, φ_dot) is C^2 in both arguments and uniformly convex in φ_dot.
- V(φ, Γ) is C^2, bounded below, and satisfies at least quadratic growth in φ for coercivity.

Environment and units:
- Γ denotes local temporal density; all references to Γ are to a C^1 field along the orbit.
- Unless stated otherwise, we use natural units (ℏ = c = 1) and metric signature (+,−,−,−).
- Indexing: Greek indices 0..3 for spacetime, Latin i..j for spatial components.

Regularity and compactness:
- Compactness for variational problems is taken in the weak H^1 topology; weak lower semicontinuity holds for J by convexity in φ_dot and growth in φ.

Numerical notes:
- “Shooting method” refers to phase-conditioned periodic orbit finding with Newton correction.
- Spectral estimates use multitaper windows unless otherwise noted.
