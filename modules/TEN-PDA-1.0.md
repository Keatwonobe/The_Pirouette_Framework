## §1 · Purpose
To analyze and model persuasion as a dynamic process of directed resonance transfer, aimed at aligning a target's cognitive or behavioral state with the persuader's intent by shaping the target's potential field through resonant messaging and interaction.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Persuasion is a resonance-based interaction where a persuader attempts to create a new, or modify an existing, attractor in the target's cognitive/behavioral parameter space, making the desired state more probable. This involves modulating the target's Time-Adherence ($T_a^{target}$) to existing beliefs, navigating their Gladiator Force ($\Gamma^{target}$ – resistance/openness), and leveraging $K_i$-resonant communication rhythms and message framing to build a 'persuasion wound channel'.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a^{persuader}$ reflects message consistency. $T_a^{target}$ reflects adherence to current beliefs/behaviors; persuasion often aims to temporarily lower $T_a^{target}$ to enable change ($F_{persuasion} \propto (1-T_a^{target})$). The $P(success)$ depends on achieving $T_a^{alignment}$.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: $\Gamma^{target}$ represents the target's openness or resistance to new information/influence ($\\Gamma^{target} = \Gamma_0 / (OpennessScore \cdot (1-T_a^{target}))$). Persuasion aims to navigate or reduce this perceived $\Gamma$. $F_{persuasion} \propto 1/\Gamma^{target}$.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ governs optimal timing and rhythm of persuasive communication, message framing for resonance, and phase alignment between persuader's intent and target's receptivity ($\cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{PT})$ term in $F_{persuasion}$). $K_i$ also influences $\Phi_{persuasion}$ structure.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: $V_{persuasion}$ is a function of phase alignment $\phi$ between message and target's cognitive state. $F_{persuasion}$ is maximized when persuader-target phase difference $\Delta\phi_{PT}$ is optimally managed.
* **Wound Channels**: Effective persuasion creates $\Phi_{persuasion}$, a wound channel in the target's cognitive space that makes the new belief/behavior more accessible and persistent. Its characteristics determine long-term impact.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Information about the persuader (credibility, intent, resources), the target (current beliefs/behaviors, psychological profile, $T_a^{target}, \Gamma^{target}$ proxies), the persuasive message (content, framing, medium), and the context (social norms, timing, channel). Data for scoring against the 12 Resonant Persuasion Dimensions.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Persuader, Target, and Message Profiling: Characterize all elements of the persuasion attempt, including initial $T_a^{target}, \Gamma^{target}$, persuader credibility ($D_1$), and message characteristics.
2. Resonant Persuasion Dimension Assessment: Evaluate the persuasion strategy against each of the 12 Resonant Persuasion Dimensions ($D_1$ Source Credibility ... $D_{12}$ Ethical Resonance).
3. Persuasion Potential Field Modeling: Model the target's cognitive potential field $V_{target,0}$ and how the persuasive attempt modifies it to $V_{persuasion}$.
4. Persuasion Force Calculation: Calculate the effective Persuasion Force $F_{persuasion} = C_P \cdot rac{A_{res} (1-T_a^{target})}{\Gamma^{target} L_{path}} \cdot \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{PT})$ (where $A_{res}$ is overall message resonance from Dimensions, $L_{path}$ is conceptual distance).
5. Resistance Dynamics Analysis: Model the target's resistance $R_{resistance}$ based on their $T_a^{target}$, $\Gamma^{target}$, and mismatch with the message.
6. Persuasion Wound Channel ($\\Phi_{persuasion}$) Analysis: Model the $\Phi_{persuasion}$ created in the target's cognitive space. Analyze its depth, persistence ($\\tau_W$), and potential to solidify new attitudes/beliefs.
7. Probabilistic Success Modeling: Estimate $P(success|persuasion)$ using the defined function, incorporating $F_{persuasion}$, $R_{resistance}$, achieved $T_a^{alignment}$, and contextual resistance $\Gamma^{context}$.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Profile scores for the 12 Resonant Persuasion Dimensions. Calculated $F_{persuasion}$ and $R_{resistance}$. Modeled $V_{persuasion}$ landscape changes. Characteristics of $\Phi_{persuasion}$. Estimated $P(success|persuasion)$ and achieved $T_a^{alignment}$.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Quantitative assessment of a persuasion strategy's likely effectiveness. Identification of key leverage points (strongest Persuasion Dimensions) and barriers (sources of resistance). Understanding of how to frame messages for optimal resonance. Prediction of attitude/behavior change probability and stability of that change.
* **Guidelines**: High $F_{persuasion}$ relative to $R_{resistance}$ indicates strong potential for influence. The profile of Persuasion Dimensions highlights strategic strengths and weaknesses. A deep, persistent $\Phi_{persuasion}$ suggests lasting impact. High $P(success|persuasion)$ coupled with high $T_a^{alignment}$ indicates a successful and stable persuasive outcome. Identify which of the 12 dimensions offer the best leverage, e.g., $D_2$ Emotional Appeal vs $D_3$ Logical Coherence.
