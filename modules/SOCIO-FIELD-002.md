## \u00a71: Purpose

To extend SOCIO-FIELD-001 by formalizing the critical parameter (\Theta)---the **Curl Threshold**---that determines when circulating social dissonance transitions from reversible fluctuation to irreversible cascade. This parameter quantifies the onset of systemic instability and defines the optimal conditions for resonance-aligned intervention.

## \u00a72: Background

From [MATH-024], the coherence continuity equation implies:
[\partial_t (T_a \omega_k) + \nabla \cdot (\Gamma \nabla C) = 0]

In social contexts, deviations from this balance manifest as curl-dominant distortions of the dissonance field (\mathbf{D}):
[\mathbf{D} = \nabla \phi + \nabla \times \mathbf{A}]

When the curl component exceeds a critical magnitude, local coherence collapse propagates nonlinearly---analogous to vortex shedding in fluid dynamics.

## \u00a73: Definition of the Curl Threshold ((\Theta))

Let:
[\Theta = \langle |\nabla \times \mathbf{A}|^2 \rangle_{\Omega_c}]
where (\Omega_c) denotes a coherence-critical region (mesoscale social cluster).

The system enters cascade mode when:
[\Theta > \Theta_c = k_\Gamma \frac{\langle |\nabla \phi|^2 \rangle}{\langle |\mathbf{A}|^2 \rangle}]

with (k_\Gamma) being a domain-dependent proportionality constant encoding the local temporal pressure field.

This expresses that instability occurs when antagonistic circulation overpowers cooperative potential by a factor exceeding (k_\Gamma).

## \u00a74: Detection Protocol

1. **Data Source:** Rolling social interaction graphs from mobility, communication, and economic exchanges.
2. **Signal Processing:**

   * Compute (\mathbf{A}) via vector potential reconstruction from residual flow fields.
   * Smooth temporally with Gaussian kernel ((\sigma_t)) to suppress noise.
3. **Local Curl Estimation:**

   * Finite-difference curl operator over graph lattice.
   * Normalize by network density to produce dimensionless (\Theta).
4. **Threshold Identification:**

   * Determine (\Theta_c) empirically by locating inflection points in the variance of (|\mathbf{D}|).
   * Confirm cross-scale invariance by rescaling spatial bins (r \rightarrow \lambda r).

---

## \u00a75: Predictive Indicators

* **Precursor Oscillation:** (\Theta(t)) exhibits rising low-frequency variance preceding social shocks.
* **Cross-Scale Locking:** (\Theta) stabilizes at invariant magnitude across scales during transition.
* **Entropy Surge:** Rate of information divergence (Shannon entropy of transactions) peaks when (\Theta \approx \Theta_c).

These define the Pirouette analogue of critical slowing down in complex adaptive systems.

---

## \u00a76: Policy Resonance Rule

The optimal policy placement radius (r_p) satisfies:
[\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{\Delta E_{coh}}{R}\right)*{r=r_p} = 0]
where (\Delta E*{coh}) is the coherence energy restored per unit resource (R).

Empirically, (r_p \approx r_c) (the coherence core boundary) minimizes systemic expenditure while maximizing coherence flux recovery.

---

## \u00a77: Empirical Implementation

1. **Metric Design:** Implement (\Theta) monitoring dashboard across real-time civic or economic datasets.
2. **Simulation Framework:** Use agent-based Pirouette environments to simulate (\Theta)-dynamics under controlled interventions.
3. **Intervention A/B Testing:** Deploy resonance-aligned aid (as defined in SOCIO-FIELD-001) at multiple radii and record post-(\Theta) relaxation rates.
4. **Criticality Validation:** Validate power-law scaling of post-intervention relaxation ((P(\tau) \sim \tau^{-\alpha})).

---

## \u00a78: Falsifiability Criteria

* If (\Theta_c) cannot be consistently determined or lacks predictive validity across domains, the universality claim fails.
* If intervention near (r_c) does not minimize coherence residue, (f(\Gamma; S_{soc})) must be reparameterized.
* If (\Theta) exhibits stochastic, uncorrelated behavior, the model overfits and coherence flow conservation does not hold.

---

## \u00a79: Future Links

* [DOMA-096] formalizes (\Theta) as the pivot variable in the Caduceus Lens, unifying laminar and turbulent coherence.
* [SOCIO-POLICY-001] establishes governance principles derived from (\Theta)-based monitoring.
* [MATH-025] will derive scaling exponents for (\Theta)-criticality, confirming the universal resonance class.

---

**Summary:** SOCIO-FIELD-002 defines the curl threshold governing systemic dissonance and coherence collapse. It establishes a falsifiable, quantitative bridge between Pirouette's resonance law and real-world social stability, enabling predictive governance and energy-efficient intervention design.
