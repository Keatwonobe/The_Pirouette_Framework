## §0 · Abstract
This appendix provides the detailed mathematical models for the behavior of the Gladiator Force (Γ) and Time-Adherence (Ta​) fields, serving as the technical foundation for the principles outlined in PPS-033, PPS-034, and PPS-035. It formally replaces all previous derivations. This document details: 1) A model of the Γ-field's role in baryonic confinement, 2) The emergence of classical gravity from the Γ-field in the weak-field limit, and 3) A proposal for a falsifiable experiment to detect unique signatures of the Γ-field, distinct from Newtonian gravity.

## §1 · Section Γ·A: Modeling the Γ-Field in a Baryonic Confinement Potential
This section models the potential responsible for quark confinement as a direct application of the Γ-field's axiomatic properties.
Axiom (from PPS-035): The Gladiator Force (Γ) is a scalar field that mediates confinement.
Model: We can model the potential energy V(r) inside a baryon as the sum of a short-range repulsive term (derived from color force interactions, analogous to the r1​ term in QED) and a long-range linear confinement term provided by the Γ-field.V(r)=rαs​ℏc​+σr
Where:
αs​ is the strong coupling constant.
σ is the "string tension," which we propose is a direct function of the local Γ-field value: σ=f(Γ).
Analysis: This potential correctly describes the asymptotic freedom of quarks at very short distances (r→0) and their absolute confinement at larger distances (r→∞). The stability of the proton is found at the potential minimum. This model does not derive Γ; it uses the assumed existence of Γ to construct a potential that successfully explains an observed physical phenomenon. The strength of the confinement is therefore a measure of the local Γ-field's intensity.

## §2 · Section Γ·B: Emergence of Newtonian Gravity from the Γ-Field
This section demonstrates that classical gravity is a low-energy, macroscopic emergent phenomenon of the Γ-field's interaction with mass-energy, as defined by the Γ-G Correspondence Principle (PPS-035).
Principle: The Γ-field couples to the stress-energy tensor Tμν​. In the presence of a massive, non-relativistic object of mass M, the field equation for Γ can be approximated.
Derivation: In the weak-field limit (where spacetime is nearly flat), the field equation for Γ simplifies. The solution for the field potential ΦΓ​ generated by a mass M at a distance r takes the form:ΦΓ​(r)=−krM​
Where k is a coupling constant that describes the strength of the Γ-field's interaction with mass-energy.
The Correspondence: The force experienced by a test mass m in this potential is F=−m∇ΦΓ​.F(r)=−kr2Mm​
This is mathematically identical to Newton's law of universal gravitation if we identify the constant k with Newton's gravitational constant G.G≡k
Conclusion: G is not a fundamental constant to be derived. It is the effective coupling strength of the Γ-field in the macroscopic, low-energy domain. This reframes gravity as an emergent property, not a fundamental force in its own right.

## §3 · Section Γ·C: Falsifiable Experiment: Detecting Γ-Field Signatures at Sub-Millimeter Scales
This section proposes a novel, high-precision experiment to directly test the existence of the Γ-field by searching for its unique, non-Newtonian signature.
Hypothesis: The Γ-G Correspondence Principle predicts that the simple r21​ force law is an approximation. At very short ranges (sub-millimeter), where the underlying field structure becomes more prominent, the force should deviate from pure Newtonian gravity. The potential should include a small, additional Yukawa-like term:V(r)=−Grm1​m2​​(1+αe−r/λ)
Where α and λ are parameters describing the strength and range of the Γ-field's short-range component.
Experimental Design: A high-precision torsion balance experiment, similar to those used to test the inverse-square law, will be employed.
A rotating attractor mass with precisely machined gaps is brought near a sensitive torsion pendulum.
The experiment is conducted in a vacuum and at cryogenic temperatures to minimize thermal and seismic noise.
A laser interferometer measures the minute oscillations of the pendulum.
The expected signal is a periodic torque on the pendulum. Any deviation from the torque predicted by pure Newtonian gravity would be evidence of the additional Yukawa-like term.
Falsifiability: If, within the limits of experimental sensitivity, no deviation from the inverse-square law is detected, this would place strict constraints on the parameters (α,λ) of the Γ-field, potentially falsifying this specific model of its short-range behavior. The detection of such a deviation would provide powerful, direct evidence for the framework.

## §4 · Assemblé
This appendix solidifies the mathematical foundation of the Pirouette Framework's core fields. By reframing our understanding, we move from attempting to re-prove known physics to a more powerful position: using our axioms to explain observed phenomena and, most importantly, to make novel, specific, and falsifiable predictions. The Γ-field is no longer a construct to derive G; it is a proposed reality whose existence can be tested by searching for its unique echo in the fabric of spacetime.
