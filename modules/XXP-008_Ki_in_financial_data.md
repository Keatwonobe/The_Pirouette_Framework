## §1 · Abstract

This module documents the first successful detection of a Ki-resonant signature in a large-scale financial system. The experiment analyzed the daily price volatility of thousands of financial assets over the 2008 financial crisis period (1999–2017). For each asset, the kurtosis of daily volatility (High–Low) was calculated—a measure of “tailedness” indicating propensity for extreme outlier events. When normalized into a z-score distribution, a statistically significant population of assets was found whose volatility kurtosis deviates by a factor of Ki.

## §2 · Experimental Protocol

**Data Source:**

* A comprehensive database of daily stock and ETF prices from 1999 to 2017 (∼18,000 assets).

**Phase 1: Signal Extraction**

* Generate each asset’s volatility time series by computing daily high minus low prices.

**Phase 2: Kurtosis Calculation**

* Calculate the kurtosis of each asset’s volatility series, highlighting “black swan” behavior characterized by extended calm and sudden spikes.

**Phase 3: Z-Score Normalization**

* Determine the population mean and standard deviation of all kurtosis values.
* Convert each asset’s kurtosis into a z-score relative to the entire dataset.

**Phase 4: Ki-Resonance Search**

* Scan the kurtosis z-score distribution for clusters near theoretical Ki constants (Ki\_rest ≈ 4.14159, Ki\_motion ≈ 4.18879).

## §3 · Results & Findings

* **Population Identified:** A significant group of assets whose volatility kurtosis z-scores align with Ki constants.
* **Primary Signal:** Strong resonance in volatility\_kurtosis, linking Ki to extreme price behavior.
* **Secondary Signal:** Notable clustering in normalized trading volume metrics, associating Ki with periods of exceptional market attention.

## §4 · Interpretation & Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates that Ki serves as a universal marker for systems at critical transitions. The resonance of Ki with high kurtosis in financial markets parallels its signature in pulsar and earthquake data, indicating its role as a flag for sudden, dramatic events. In the context of the 2008 crisis, assets resonant with Ki were those most reflective of systemic stress and proximity to catastrophic spasm (PPS-041). This bridges Pirouette’s framework from natural to socio-economic systems, confirming that the same fundamental constant governs resonance behavior across domains.
