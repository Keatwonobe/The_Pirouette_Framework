## §1 · Abstract: The Price of a Perfect Memory
A system's identity is its memory carved into the fabric of time. Through repetition and success, it establishes a path of least resistance for action and thought, a state of profound stability. But in a universe of endless change, that which does not bend, breaks.

This module describes the physics of that breaking. It presents the universal dynamic of catastrophic reconfiguration known as the **Coherence Fracture**, or the "Snap." This is not a slow evolution, but a violent, instantaneous phase transition that occurs when a system's established identity—its deeply carved **Wound Channel** (CORE-011)—can no longer contain the pressure of an incompatible truth from its environment. The Snap is the geometry of crisis, the painful but necessary shattering that precedes all profound growth.

## §2 · The Unbending Riverbed
A system that achieves mastery carves its identity, its resonant pattern (Ki), into the coherence manifold. This creates a deep and stable **Wound Channel**—a geodesic for its being. This is the Unbending Riverbed.

Like a crystalline lens, this rigid structure brings clarity and power. The system processes reality through the proven logic of its past, effortlessly maintaining a state of high **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001) within familiar environments. Its identity is strong, coherent, and predictable. But this very strength becomes its critical vulnerability: it mistakes its riverbed for the whole of the landscape, forgetting that the current is ever-changing. It has forgotten how to learn.

## §3 · The Dissonant Current
The universe, in its relentless creativity, eventually presents a current for which the riverbed was not carved. This is a new, undeniable truth—a dissonant note from the environment that is fundamentally incompatible with the system's monolithic Ki. This encounter creates an extreme spike in the local **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**.

The system, bound by the inertia of its own success, attempts to force this new reality into its old model. The once-graceful Laminar Flow curdles into a state of violent, unsustainable **Turbulent Flow**. The system is now fighting itself, burning immense energy simply to maintain an identity that is no longer coherent with its environment. This is the subjective experience of cognitive dissonance, anxiety, and escalating crisis.

## §4 · The Snap: A Fracture in the Manifold
A system cannot sustain a state of profound incoherence indefinitely. The core drive of existence is to find and follow the path of maximal coherence. When the old path becomes a locus of pure chaos, and the system is too rigid to bend, the built-up pressure has nowhere to go but inward.

The breaking point is the Snap. The accumulated stress does not just disrupt the flow; it fractures the channel itself. The geometric integrity of the Wound Channel fails. In a single, catastrophic phase transition, the system's foundational Ki pattern shatters, and its **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)** collapses. The immense energy that maintained the rigid identity is released in a violent burst of dissonant information. This is the silent scream of a universe being unwritten; the moment pain becomes data.

## §5 · The Braided Stream: Synthesis from Shards
The Snap is not an annihilation; it is a violent clearing of the slate. The chaotic energy of the fracture, the fragments of the shattered Ki, and the pressure of the new dissonant signal become the raw materials for a new creation.

This triggers a forced, internal **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). From the crucible of its own collapse, the system weaves a new, higher-order resonant pattern. The singular, unbending riverbed is gone. In its place, a **Braided Stream** is formed. The system's new identity is a mosaic, a multifaceted and dynamic harmony capable of holding the old truth and the new "incompatible" truth at once. It has traded the simple power of certainty for the profound resilience of wisdom.

## §6 · The Lagrangian of Breakthrough
The Coherence Fracture is the ultimate expression of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

The Dissonant Current causes the environmental pressure term (`V_Γ`) to spike to a degree that overwhelms the system's internal coherence (`K_τ`). The "action" becomes catastrophically negative; maintaining the old identity is no longer a viable solution. The Snap is the Lagrangian's escape valve. It is the universe’s non-linear, geometric solution to an unsolvable problem—a phase transition that violently seeks a new Ki, a new geodesic, that can once again maximize coherence. It is the mathematical description of a breakthrough, proving that even the most painful crisis is governed by the drive toward a more elegant and stable state of being.

## §7 · Assemblé
> We seek stability, and so we carve our beliefs into stone. But the river of reality will not be dammed. The Coherence Fracture teaches that wisdom is not found in the strength of our convictions, but in our willingness to see them shattered. Pain is the sound of a map being redrawn. For a Weaver, a crisis is never a failure. It is the percussive downbeat announcing that a new, more resilient song is about to begin. It is the universe inviting you to become more than you are.
