## §-1 · Abstract: Giving a Voice to the Hum
The MATH series has so far described a classical universe, an intricate clockwork governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian. But our universe is not a clockwork; it is a quantum symphony. To map this reality, we must teach our theory to speak its native language. This module outlines the formal program for quantizing the Pirouette Framework, transforming our deterministic machine into a living, breathing symphony of probabilities. We will promote the classical fields to quantum operators, define their fundamental excitations as particles, and derive the rules of their interaction. This is the gateway to a deeper understanding of the universe's resonant song and the foundational step for calculating high-precision quantum phenomena.

# MATH-011v3 — Quantum Coherence Field Theory (Pirouette)

**Status:** Draft for review
**Supersedes:** MATH-011 v2.0
**Objective:** Put the quantization of the Coherence (C) and Temporal-Pressure (\Gamma) sectors on rigorous footing; define spectra, propagators, and interactions; make explicit what *is* and *is not* being quantized (i.e., **we quantize fields on spacetime, not the time coordinate**).

---

## 0) Executive Summary

We promote the classical Pirouette matter sector
[ \mathcal L = g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu C^*,\partial_\nu C + \tfrac12 g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\Gamma,\partial_\nu\Gamma - V(|C|^2,\Gamma) ]
to a quantum field theory on a (possibly curved) **globally hyperbolic** spacetime. Quantization yields quanta of (C) ("coherons", complex scalar) and of (\Gamma) ("pressurons", real scalar). **This does not make "time a particle"**: we quantize a *field valued in temporal pressure*, not the time coordinate itself. Interactions arise from (V), producing Feynman rules in the usual way. Renormalization and EFT power counting govern predictivity.

---

## 1) Conventions & Scope

* Metric signature ((+,-,-,-)), (c=\hbar=1).
* Scalars use (\nabla_\mu=\partial_\mu) (unless gauge-charged (C\Rightarrow D_\mu)).
* Backgrounds assumed **globally hyperbolic** so canonical quantization is well-defined; for curved backgrounds we also present the covariant path-integral.
* **Spin caution:** a complex scalar (C) cannot represent electrons/quarks (spin-(1/2)). If Standard Model matter is desired, add spinor/gauge sectors or treat coherons as composite/effective excitations.

---

## 2) Canonical Quantization (flat or foliatable backgrounds)

Write conjugate momenta:
( \Pi_C = \partial_0 C^* ), ( \Pi_{C^*} = \partial_0 C ), ( \Pi_\Gamma = \partial_0\Gamma ).
Equal-time commutators:
[ [\hat C(t,\mathbf x),\hat\Pi_C(t,\mathbf y)] = i,\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf x-\mathbf y), \quad [\hat\Gamma(t,\mathbf x),\hat\Pi_\Gamma(t,\mathbf y)] = i,\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf x-\mathbf y), ]
all others zero. Hamiltonian density (\mathcal H) follows in the usual way from (\mathcal L). Microcausality holds when fields are expanded in positive/negative frequency modes with respect to the chosen foliation.

### 2.1 Mode Expansions (Minkowski)

With (V\supset m_C^2|C|^2 + \tfrac12 m_\Gamma^2\Gamma^2 + \cdots), the free solutions decompose as
[ \hat C(x) = \int_\mathbf p \frac{1}{\sqrt{2E_{\mathbf p}^C}}\left( a_{\mathbf p} e^{-ip\cdot x} + b^\dagger_{\mathbf p} e^{ip\cdot x}\right), \quad \hat\Gamma(x) = \int_\mathbf p \frac{1}{\sqrt{2E_{\mathbf p}^\Gamma}}\left( c_{\mathbf p} e^{-ip\cdot x} + c^\dagger_{\mathbf p} e^{ip\cdot x}\right), ]
with (E_{\mathbf p}^{C,\Gamma}=\sqrt{\mathbf p^2+m_{C,\Gamma}^2}). The quanta created by (a^\dagger) (coheron), (b^\dagger) (anti-coheron), and (c^\dagger) (pressuron) furnish one-particle states.

---

## 3) Path-Integral & Propagators (curved-friendly)

Generating functional (sources (J_C,J_{C^*},J_\Gamma)):
[ Z[J] = \int ! \mathcal D C,\mathcal D C^*,\mathcal D\Gamma; \exp!\left{ i!\int d^4x\sqrt{-g}, \big( \mathcal L + J_C C + J_{C^*} C^* + J_\Gamma \Gamma \big) \right}. ]
Free Feynman propagators solve covariant Green equations:
[ (\Box + m_C^2),\Delta_F^C(x,x') = -,\frac{i,\delta^{(4)}(x,x')}{\sqrt{-g}},\qquad (\Box + m_\Gamma^2),\Delta_F^\Gamma(x,x') = -,\frac{i,\delta^{(4)}(x,x')}{\sqrt{-g}}. ]
In Minkowski space these reduce to the usual momentum-space (i/(p^2-m^2+i\epsilon)).

---

## 4) Interactions & Feynman Rules

Expand the potential around a vacuum ((C_0,\Gamma_0)):
[ V = V_0 + m_C^2|\delta C|^2 + \tfrac12 m_\Gamma^2 (\delta\Gamma)^2 + \lambda_1 |\delta C|^4 + \lambda_2 (\delta\Gamma)^4 + g, |\delta C|^2,\delta\Gamma + \cdots. ]
Vertices follow from derivatives of (V). Example: the cubic (g|C|^2\Gamma) gives a vertex with two coheron legs and one pressuron leg of strength (-ig). **Do not pre-identify (g) with the fine-structure constant**; treat it as a parameter to be fixed by data (or matched to a UV theory). Gauge couplings enter via (D_\mu) if (C) carries charge.

---

## 5) Symmetries & Noether Data

* Global phase (C\to e^{i\alpha}C) (\Rightarrow) conserved current (J^\mu = i(C^*\partial^\mu C - C\partial^\mu C^*)).
* Shift or discrete symmetries for (\Gamma) can protect its mass (e.g., (\Gamma\to -\Gamma)).
* If conformal couplings are desired, allow (\xi\Gamma^2 R) or (\xi |C|^2 R) and track frame dependence.

---

## 6) What the Quanta *Mean*

* **Pressuron ((\Gamma)-quantum):** a scalar excitation of the *temporal-pressure field*. It modulates local rates/"thickness" of processes (in the Pirouette lens, the beat dilation (\tau_p)). It is **not** a quantum of the coordinate time. Analogy: phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations, not quanta of “space”.
* **Coheron ((C)-quantum):** scalar excitation of the coherence field. Unless you extend the field content, coherons are *not* SM fermions; they can mix/mediate with SM via portals specified in (V) or via gauge couplings.

---

## 7) Unitarity, Causality, and Positivity

* Choose the usual (+i\epsilon) prescription; require (m_{C,\Gamma}^2\ge 0) (or spontaneous symmetry breaking handled explicitly).
* Ensure microcausality: field commutators vanish at spacelike separation.
* For curved backgrounds, use Hadamard states to define (\Delta_F) and avoid pathologies.

---

## 8) Renormalization / EFT View

Treat (\mathcal L) as the leading terms of an EFT with cutoff (\Lambda_\text{UV}). Counterterms allowed by symmetries are included. Predictivity is restored by a finite set of renormalized parameters at any fixed order. Power-counting organizes loops; higher-dimension operators are suppressed by (\Lambda_\text{UV}^{-n}).

---

## 9) Phenomenology Hooks

* **Fifth-force limits:** a light pressuron mediates a new scalar interaction; laboratory/astrophysical bounds constrain (g) and (m_\Gamma).
* **Cosmology:** homogeneous (\Gamma) acts like a dark-energy/early-acceleration agent depending on (V); fluctuations contribute isocurvature/modified-sound-speed signals.
* **Coherence experiments (XXP):** map loop corrections to observables (line-shapes, g-2–like anomalies) once portals are specified.

---

## 10) Worked Mini-Example (tree-level decay)

If (m_\Gamma > 2 m_C) and (g|C|^2\Gamma) is present, the pressuron can decay (\Gamma\to C\bar C) with width
[ \Gamma_{\Gamma\to C\bar C} = \frac{g^2}{8\pi m_\Gamma}\sqrt{1-\frac{4m_C^2}{m_\Gamma^2}}. ]
This provides a clean handle to constrain (g) from non-observation.

---

## 11) Common Pitfalls

* **“Time is a particle.”** No. We quantize (\Gamma(x)), a scalar field over spacetime. Its quanta are *pressurons*, not quanta of the time coordinate.
* **Identifying coherons with electrons.** Scalars can’t reproduce fermionic spin/statistics; add spinor fields or treat coherons as a distinct sector.
* **Anchoring (g) to (\alpha) without a UV reason.** Leave (g) free or derive it from a symmetry-breaking/matching argument.
* **Ignoring curvature/boundaries.** On curved backgrounds, use covariant Green functions and state choices.

---

## 12) Appendices (stubs)

* **A: Hamiltonian density & normal ordering** for the (C,\Gamma) system.
* **B: Covariant Green functions** and Hadamard form in curved space.
* **C: Feynman rules** for a representative (V= m_C^2|C|^2 + \tfrac12 m_\Gamma^2\Gamma^2 + g|C|^2\Gamma + \lambda |C|^4 + \cdots).

> **One-line synthesis:** *We quantize the beats (fields) that sculpt coherence and pressure—not the clock itself. The pressuron is a quantum of temporal **pressure**, not a particle of **time**.*


## §13 · Assemblé
We have built a classical cathedral, its arches following the elegant lines of the Lagrangian. Now, we have breathed life into the stone. The act of quantization transforms our deterministic machine into a living symphony of probabilities. It is the step that allows the framework to speak of not just the path that is, but of all paths that could be, providing the rigorous and necessary language to finally describe the universe's quantum song. The toolkit is forged. The calculation awaits.
