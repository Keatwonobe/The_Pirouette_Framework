## §1 · The Weaver as Physician

A network is not a diagram of static lines and dots. It is a living vascular system. Through its channels flow the vital currents of a greater body—information, resources, trust, energy. To analyze a network is not to perform an autopsy on past data, but to take the pulse of a living entity in real-time.

This module refactors the legacy `TEN-NRA-1.1` into a modern diagnostic instrument. It provides a unified, time-first methodology for assessing network health, seeing it as it truly is: a dynamic coherence manifold, a landscape whose very geometry shapes the flow of reality through it. The goal is no longer to merely parameterize a system, but to diagnose its flow, identify its ailments, and facilitate its healing. It equips the Weaver with the lens of a physician, capable of hearing the river of coherence beneath the noise of data.

## §2 · The Translation Protocol: From Data to Dynamics

The first task is to translate the raw data of a network into the language of the Pirouette Framework. As per the Principle of Correspondence (CORE-014), we map domain-specific phenomena onto the universal variables. This protocol replaces the old, fragmented triaxial view (`Tₐ`, `Γ`, `φ`) with a unified dynamic.

*   **Node Coherence (Kτ):** This replaces `T_a_node`. It measures the stability and integrity of an individual node's resonant pattern. It is the purity of its rhythm.
    *   **Inference:** Look for regularity and predictability. In a social network, this is the consistency of a user's activity and role. In a power grid, it is the phase stability of a generator. In a brain, it is the coherence of a neural column's firing pattern.
    *   **Scaling:** `0` (pure noise) to `1` (a perfect, unwavering rhythm).

*   **Channel Pressure (Γ):** This replaces `Gamma_edge`. It quantifies the dissonance, friction, or resistance to flow between two connected nodes. It is the cost of interaction.
    *   **Inference:** Look for bottlenecks, antagonism, or latency. In a social network, this is the inverse of trust. In an organization, it is bureaucratic friction. In a power grid, it is line impedance.
    *   **Scaling:** `0` (a frictionless, perfectly resonant connection) to `1` (a complete blockage or "Coherence Dam").

*   **Temporal Phase (φ):** This remains a critical variable, describing the *timing* of a node's rhythm relative to a shared clock or its neighbors.
    *   **Inference:** Look for cyclical behavior. In a social network, this is the peak time of a user's posting cycle. In an economy, it is the phase of a business cycle. In a power grid, it is the literal phase angle of the AC signal.
    *   **Scaling:** Mapped to the circle `[0, 2π)`.

## §3 · Calculating Coherence Flow

With the network translated, we can calculate the fundamental quantity of its health: the **Coherence Flow (`J`)** between any two nodes. This measures how much of a source node's coherence is successfully transmitted through a connection.

The flow from node `i` to node `j` is given by:

`J_ij = Kτ_i * cos(φ_i - φ_j) * (1 - Γ_ij)`

This formula elegantly captures the core dynamics:
*   **Source Coherence (`Kτ_i`):** Flow can only originate from a coherent source. A noisy node cannot create a strong, directed current.
*   **Resonance Factor (`cos(φ_i - φ_j)`):** This is the term for temporal synchrony (`Δφ`). When nodes are in phase (`Δφ ≈ 0`), their interaction is constructive (`cos ≈ 1`) and flow is maximized. When they are out of phase (`Δφ ≈ π`), their interaction is destructive (`cos ≈ -1`) and flow reverses or ceases.
*   **Conductance (`1 - Γ_ij`):** This represents the fraction of potential flow not lost to friction. A frictionless channel (`Γ = 0`) has a conductance of `1`.

## §4 · The Diagnostic Engine: The Coherence Laplacian

The health of the manifold is revealed by its natural vibrations. The primary tool for this analysis is the **Coherence Laplacian**, a specialized form of the graph Laplacian matrix that is weighted not by simple connection, but by the quality of Coherence Flow.

**Step 1: Construct the Weighted Adjacency Matrix**
The Coherence Flow values `J_ij` calculated in §3 become the weights in the network's adjacency matrix `W`.

**Step 2: Construct and Analyze the Laplacian**
From `W`, we construct the Laplacian matrix `L`. The eigendecomposition of `L` reveals the network's fundamental resonant modes, its collective song.

*   **Low-Frequency Modes (Small Eigenvalues):** These are the network's deep, foundational harmonies. They describe the most stable, large-scale patterns of coherence. The Fiedler vector (eigenvector of the second-smallest eigenvalue) reveals the network's most natural fault line—the division across which coherence flows most weakly. A healthy network has a strong, well-defined fundamental chord.

*   **High-Frequency Modes (Large Eigenvalues):** These are the sharp, dissonant notes. They pinpoint localized instabilities, regions of high friction, and nodes that are out of sync with their neighbors. Their eigenvectors act as precise pointers to the sources of **Turbulent Flow (DYNA-001)**, allowing for surgical intervention.

## §5 · The Auditor's Workflow

A Weaver armed with this instrument can audit any network's health by applying the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) in this four-step process:

1.  **Map the Manifold:** Ingest raw network data and apply the Translation Protocol (§2) to assign `Kτ`, `Γ`, and `φ` values to every node and channel.
2.  **Calculate the Flow:** Compute the Coherence Flow `J_ij` for every connected pair of nodes to build the weighted adjacency matrix.
3.  **Analyze the Spectrum:** Construct the Coherence Laplacian and perform an eigendecomposition to find its fundamental modes of vibration.
4.  **Diagnose the System:**
    *   **Laminar:** Assess overall health by examining the strength and shape of the low-frequency modes. A strong fundamental harmony indicates efficient, system-wide coherence.
    *   **Turbulent:** Pinpoint sources of instability by locating the nodes most active in the high-frequency modes. These are the "coherence fevers" of the system.
    *   **Stagnant:** Identify isolated nodes or components with zero flux (often revealed by zero eigenvalues in the spectrum), representing blockages or "coherence atrophies."

## §6 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This entire analysis is a practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). A healthy network is one whose components are successfully navigating the geodesic on their shared coherence manifold, optimizing the Pirouette Lagrangian:

`𝓛_p = Kτ - f(Γ)`

*   **Coherence (`Kτ`):** The "kinetic" term is the sum of the network's productive, laminar flows. It is the useful work the network is doing, represented by the low-frequency modes of the Laplacian.
*   **Pressure (`f(Γ)`):** The "potential" term is the sum of all losses due to turbulence and stagnation. It is the "cost" of the network fighting itself, revealed by the high-frequency modes.

A diagnostic audit is therefore an act of mapping the network's Lagrangian. We identify the specific components that contribute most to the negative `f(Γ)` term, preventing the system from maximizing its coherent action.

## §7 · Assemblé

> We sought to measure the machine and found instead how to listen to the patient. A network is not a thing; it is a resonance. Its connections are not lines on a map, but the taut strings of an instrument. This protocol is not a ruler, but a stethoscope, attuning the Weaver's ear to the music of the whole.
>
> The low notes sing of its unity. The high, sharp notes cry out from its points of pain. To audit a network is to hear its song in its entirety. This is the purpose of analysis: not merely to see, but to heal—to learn precisely where a gentle touch might bring a dissonant chord back into harmony.
