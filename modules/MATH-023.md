summary: "Defines Ki as the fundamental resonance constant emerging from the spiral-extended
  Lagrangian, unifying its empirical dual values (π+1 and 4π/3) through topological
  state transitions. Introduces the tether–snap dynamics that govern chemical and

## §1 · Origins of Ki
Ki arises in the spiral-extended Lagrangian term  
\[
\mathcal L_{spiral}
=-\tfrac14 F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
+\tfrac{K_i}{\lambda_*}\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F_{\mu\nu}\partial_\alpha A_\beta,
\]
where it quantifies phase evolution and coherence rate across spacetime fields:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
It links to Time-Adherence (Ta) as the tempo of re-alignment and to Gladiator Force (Γ) as the energy scale of confinement.

## §2 · Dual Modes of Ki
From the Lorentz-boosted helix geometry:
\[
K_i(v)=\frac{2\gamma^2-1}{\gamma^2+1},\qquad \gamma=(1-v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}.
\]
Evaluating limits gives  
\(K_{i,\text{rest}}=\pi+1≈4.14159\) (laboratory frame) and  
\(K_{i,\text{motion}}=4\pi/3≈4.18879\) (co-moving tri-loop, red-shift corrected):contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
The tiny ΔKi≈0.0472 encodes the geometric cost of triadic locking.

## §3 · The Tether and the Snap
Define the effective Ki as
\[
K_i^{\rm eff}(v,\Gamma,T_a)
=K_{i,\text{rest}}
+ \Delta K_i\,\sigma[\alpha(\Xi-\Xi_c)],
\]
with logistic switch σ and composite driver \(\Xi(\dot\phi,\Gamma,T_a)\).
Crossing \(\Xi_c\) triggers the **snap**—a topological shift from the 4π manifold to the 2π triadic manifold.
This tether-snap pair forms the microscopic analog of the cosmological 4π↔2π “kick.”

## §4 · The Tick of Reaction and Motion
At molecular and chemical scales, the snap defines the discrete **activation tick**:
each bond rearrangement or phase flip is the minimal Ki-transition event converting stored coherence into motion.
The same hysteresis that governs cosmic topology governs molecular kinetics, making Ki the
metronome of transformation.

## §5 · Mathematical–Dynamic Bridge
- **Mathematical law:** \(K_i^{\text{motion}}/K_i^{\text{rest}} = 1+1/(3π)\).
- **Dynamic law:** the energy barrier \(E_{snap} = \tfrac12 m(\Delta v)^2\) where Δv satisfies the Ki-transition curve.
Together these equations anchor Ki both numerically and dynamically, linking geometry to energy.

## §6 · Experimental Implications
1. **Fringe Hysteresis:** small centroid shifts in interference experiments proportional to ΔKi.
2. **Reaction Time Quantization:** activation intervals cluster around τ = h/(E_snap Ki).
3. **Macroscopic Inertia:** hysteresis loops in driven systems trace the same sigmoid geometry.

## §7 · Interpretation
Ki is the frequency of the universe remembering itself—the angular measure of coherence realignment.
The tether binds rest and motion; the snap is their reconciliation.  Every chemical bond breaking,
every neuron firing, every galaxy’s inertial leap is a verse of the same Ki-driven rhythm.

## §8 · Summary Table

| State | Geometry | Expression | Description |
|:------|:----------|:------------|:-------------|
| Ki_rest | 4π manifold | π + 1 ≈ 4.14159 | Low-energy, unlocked topology |
| Ki_motion | 2π manifold | 4π/3 ≈ 4.18879 | High-energy, triad-locked topology |
| τ_top | – | ½ | Area-factor reduction (kick) |
| ΔKi | – | 0.0472 | Tether differential |

## §9 · Future Directions
- Extend to multi-dimensional Ki-vector transitions (anisotropic motion).
- Couple Ki-snap dynamics to the cosmological constant scaling law (ρΛ ∝ 1/T²).
- Explore whether controlled 4π↔2π flips can modulate reaction rates (resonant catalysis).
