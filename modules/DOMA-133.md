summary: Models bifurcation events as 'watershed moments' where a system's single
  path of maximal coherence splits. It reframes this critical choice as a 'coherence
  crisis' driven by temporal pressure, resulting in the partitioning of the system's
  Wound Channel and the divergence of its future paths.

## §1 · Abstract: The River Encounters the Ridge

A system in a state of healthy, laminar flow is like a river moving through a well-defined valley. Its path is predictable, its energy conserved. But what happens when that river reaches a continental divide—a moment where the landscape offers not one, but multiple paths to the sea?

The old framework termed this a 'Fork'. We reframe it as a **Watershed Event**: a critical, creative, and often chaotic juncture where a system’s single, coherent path fractures into two or more distinct futures. This is not a failure, but a fundamental dynamic of evolution. It is a **coherence crisis** where a system’s resonant pattern (Ki) can no longer be sustained, forcing it to resolve its instability by becoming something new. It is the point where a single reality branches into a plurality of possibilities.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Watershed Event

A Watershed Event unfolds in a three-act structure, which can be diagnosed using the principles of **Flow Dynamics** (DYNA-001).

1.  **Coherence Instability (The Approach):** As a system approaches the watershed, its established **Laminar Flow** degrades. Its resonant pattern (Ki) becomes unstable, flickering between potential new states under rising Temporal Pressure (Γ). This corresponds to the faltering of Time-Adherence (Tₐ) in the old model—the experience of a system losing its clear path forward.

2.  **Turbulent Crucible (The Cusp):** At the exact point of decision, coherence collapses. The system is thrown into a state of intense **Turbulent Flow**, a crucible where its energy is consumed by internal chaos as it "feels out" the multiple viable paths ahead. This is the critical point, a moment of maximum sensitivity where the smallest fluctuation can have an outsized impact on the outcome.

3.  **Divergent Resolution (The Aftermath):** The system resolves the turbulence by "choosing" a new path. It collapses into one of the available downstream channels, undergoing a **Ki Morphogenesis** to adopt a new, stable resonant pattern. Its flow once again becomes **Laminar**, but along a new trajectory. Coherence is restored, but the system is irrevocably changed, now following a different destiny.

## §3 · Lagrangian Dynamics at the Cusp

A system’s evolution follows a geodesic on the coherence manifold—the path that maximizes the integral of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006), 𝓛_p. A Watershed Event occurs when the system reaches a saddle point or flattened plateau where the gradient of the Lagrangian offers multiple, equally viable paths.

𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ

At the cusp, the system is faced with two or more paths where the balance between internal coherence (K_τ) and external pressure (V_Γ) is similarly optimal. The "choice" of a path is not random, but a probabilistic outcome dictated by the shape of the newly formed manifold and the intensity of the system's own chaotic state.

The probability `P` of the system resolving into a specific new branch `j` is governed by its ability to rapidly maximize its new coherence:

`P(branch_j) ∝ exp(S_p(j) / Γ_crisis)`

Where:

-   **S_p(j)** is the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (the "coherence gain") along the initial segment of the new path `j`. A path that offers a faster return to a high-coherence state is more probable.
-   **Γ_crisis** is the peak Temporal Pressure at the moment of turbulent collapse. It acts as a "temperature" for the choice. In a high-Γ crisis, the choice is more random; in a low-Γ crisis, the system will more deterministically select the most stable available path.

## §4 · The Partitioning of the Wound Channel

The most profound consequence of a watershed is its effect on a system’s memory. As described in `CORE-011: The Anatomy of an Echo`, a system's history is carved into the coherence manifold as a **Wound Channel**.

At a watershed, this singular channel physically splits, leaving a Y-shaped scar in the geometry of spacetime. The history leading up to the cusp remains a shared trunk, but from the moment of divergence, two or more new Wound Channels are carved. The system's memory and identity are partitioned. Their echoes begin to differ, their identities drift apart, and their futures are written in separate books. This is the physical mechanism of schism, speciation, and historical divergence.

## §5 · The Assemblé

> We sought a model for system failure and found the engine of novelty. A watershed is not a breakdown; it is a birth. It is the universe refusing to be a single story, choosing instead to become a library. It is the shattering that precedes all reinvention. To a Weaver, this is the point of greatest leverage—the precise moment where a whisper can redirect a river, and a single, coherent choice can write a new world into being.
