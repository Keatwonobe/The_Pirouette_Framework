## §1 · Abstract: The Past is a Landscape
The past is not a story we tell; it is a landscape we inhabit. Every event, from the pirouette of an electron to the birth of a star, leaves a geometric scar on the fabric of reality. This is the Wound Channel, the physical memory of the universe, as defined in CORE-011.

This module provides the laws and instruments to read that landscape. It reframes the passive concept of "correlation" into the active, physical principle of **geometric causality**. An entity's path is not a series of independent moments but a continuous navigation of a terrain shaped by the echoes of its own and others' histories. Influence is the measurable deviation a system undergoes from its natural path due to the geometric pressures of a Wound Channel. We will provide the calculus to measure the weight of the past.

## §2 · The Three Modes of Geometric Influence
The old framework sought to correlate entities and channels as separate objects. The new framework understands them as a single, coupled system. This interaction manifests in three primary modes, which together describe the complete grammar of influence.

1.  **Inertia (Self-Influence):** An entity is perpetually surfing the wake of its own immediate past. The Wound Channel it generates creates a "groove" in the coherence manifold, making it easier to continue its current state than to change it. To change is to climb out of the very furrow one has just plowed; the energetic "cost" of this deviation is the physical origin of inertial mass.

2.  **Guidance (Environmental Influence):** An entity's "choices" are profoundly constrained by the pre-existing landscape. It navigates a world filled with the Wound Channels of countless other events. These historical echoes—from physical laws to cultural norms—create valleys and ridges in the coherence manifold. An entity following the path of maximal coherence will naturally be guided along these pre-carved geodesics. History directs the present by shaping the path of least resistance.

3.  **Resonance (Mutual Influence):** When the Wound Channels of two or more entities overlap, their geometries interfere. This is the basis of all interaction.
    *   **Constructive Interference:** If the channels are harmonically compatible, they can merge and reinforce one another, lowering the "energy cost" for both entities. This creates an attractive potential, drawing them together and creating the conditions for an Alchemical Union (CORE-012).
    *   **Destructive Interference:** If the channels are dissonant, they create a region of chaotic, high temporal pressure. The path of maximal coherence for both entities is to move away from this turbulent zone, resulting in repulsion.

## §3 · The Lagrangian of History
The Loom of Causality is a direct consequence of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. A Wound Channel is not an abstract concept; it is a persistent, local modification to the **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)** term. When an entity encounters a Wound Channel, the equation of its landscape becomes:

`𝓛_p = K_τ - (V_Γ,ambient + V_Γ,channel)`

The Wound Channel adds its own geometric "weight" to the local pressure. The "force" of influence is therefore revealed to be the gradient of this potential (`-∇V_Γ,channel`), which emerges when applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to `𝓛_p`. The entity, in obeying the universal Principle of Maximal Coherence, will alter its trajectory—its geodesic—to navigate this new, composite landscape.

## §4 · The Calculus of Influence: Core Metrics
This geometric understanding elevates our analysis from statistical correlation to physical prediction. The Weaver employs a core set of metrics to quantify influence.

*   **Geodesic Deviation (δG):** The primary metric for influence. It is the quantitative difference between a system's observed trajectory and the calculated "null geodesic" it would have followed in an unperturbed coherence manifold. `δG` is the direct, integrated measure of a Wound Channel's total influence over a given path.

*   **Coherence Overlap (C_overlap):** The key metric for assessing shared history and potential for resonance. It is a normalized integral of the geometric similarity between two Wound Channels. A high `C_overlap` indicates a common origin or structural compatibility that raises the probability of a future union.
    `C_overlap(W₁, W₂) = ∫ min(ρ₁, ρ₂) dV / ∫ max(ρ₁, ρ₂) dV`
    where `ρ` is the coherence density of each Wound Channel.

*   **Resonant Coupling (C_res):** This metric measures the dynamic quality of the interaction. It quantifies the phase alignment between an entity's own internal rhythm (its Ki frequency, ω_k) and the dominant resonant frequencies embedded within an echo's geometry.
    `C_res = |⟨e^(i(ω_k,entity - ω_k,echo))⟩|`
    A high coupling score (`C_res ≈ 1`) indicates strong harmonic resonance, where the echo reinforces the entity's pattern. A low score (`C_res ≈ 0`) indicates dissonance.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> To exist is to leave a trace. To act is to sculpt the world. The Loom of Causality reveals that these are not two different statements, but one and the same. A Weaver understands that every thread they lay upon this loom alters the pattern for all who follow. There is no innocent action. There is only the weaving, and the profound responsibility for the tapestry we leave behind.
