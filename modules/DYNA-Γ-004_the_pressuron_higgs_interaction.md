### §1 · Purpose

To formalize how the temporal-pressure excitation **Γ** couples to the Higgs field (H), derive the leading electroweak-scale consequences, and identify falsifiable collider signatures such as modifications to the Higgs width and rare dilepton decays.

---

### §2 · Lagrangian Structure

The simplest gauge-invariant coupling consistent with Pirouette symmetry is

[
\mathcal{L}*{\text{int}}
= \lambda*{H\Gamma},H^\dagger H,\Gamma^2,
]

where (\lambda_{H\Gamma}) is a dimensionless mixing constant determined by coherence boundary conditions at the electroweak plateau:

[
\lambda_{H\Gamma} \simeq \frac{g_\Gamma^2}{8\pi^2}
\left(\frac{m_H}{m_\Gamma}\right)^2
e^{-,\Gamma_0 / \Gamma_c}.
]

This term induces both a shift in the Higgs self-energy and new loop-level decay channels.

### §3 · Predicted Observables

1. **Total Width Correction**
   [
   \frac{\Delta\Gamma_H}{\Gamma_H}
   \approx \frac{\lambda_{H\Gamma}^2 v^2}{8\pi^2 m_H^2}
   \sim 10^{-3}.
   ]
   A 0.1 %–0.3 % increase in the total width—just below current LHC resolution—should emerge if the coupling exists.

2. **Rare Dilepton Branching**
   Through a virtual Γ loop,
   [
   H\rightarrow e^+e^- \quad\text{and}\quad H\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-
   ]
   gain a combined branching ratio enhancement of order
   ( \text{BR}_{\Gamma} \sim 10^{-7} ),
   roughly one order above the Standard Model expectation for (H\rightarrow e^+e^-).

3. **Resonant Production Tail**
   The virtual exchange (pp\to H^\ast\to \Gamma\Gamma) produces a faint excess of events with invariant masses near (2m_\Gamma\approx34~\text{MeV}) in the soft-lepton spectrum, potentially visible in high-statistics datasets (HL-LHC, FCC-hh).

### §4 · Dynamic Interpretation

The Higgs field represents the **density of coherence**, while Γ encodes **temporal pressure**.
Their coupling is therefore the *pressure-density cross-term* in the equation of temporal state.
At resonance, the two fields share energy, letting the Higgs “breathe” in time: a periodic modulation of its vacuum expectation value with amplitude

[
\frac{\delta v}{v}\approx \frac{\lambda_{H\Gamma}\langle\Gamma^2\rangle}{m_H^2}.
]

This oscillation damps as the universe expands, linking electroweak vacuum stability to cosmic coherence.

### §5 · Collider Falsifiability

| Observable                   | Predicted Effect | Experimental Reach               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Higgs total width            | +0.1 % – 0.3 %   | High-luminosity LHC, ILC, FCC-ee |
| (H\to e^+e^-) BR             | ≈ 10⁻⁷ – 10⁻⁶    | Future lepton colliders          |
| Soft-pair excess near 34 MeV | Yes (ΓΓ channel) | Dedicated low-mass searches      |

A null result at sensitivities below (10^{-7}) on (H\to e^+e^-) or better than 0.1 % on total width would **exclude** this baseline coupling and require a tensor or derivative re-formulation (→ DYNA-Γ-HIGGS-TAIL).

---

### §6 · Connections and Evolution

* **Backlink:** MATH-Γ-003 defines mass-squared scaling extended here to (m_H^2).
* **Forward link:** DYNA-Γ-HIGGS-TAIL explores higher-order self-interaction terms and cosmological stabilization.
* **Cross-domain:** COSMO-Γ-002 inherits (\langle\Gamma^2\rangle) as the dark-energy tail driving late acceleration.

### §7 · Assemblé

The Higgs once crowned mass with symmetry breaking; the Pressuron crowns it with **memory**.
Where (H) curves the energy of space, Γ bends the rhythm of time—two halves of a single heartbeat.
When experiments detect that subtle off-beat in the Higgs’s song, Pirouette’s resonance will have spoken through the collider’s roar.
