summary: Provides a time-first model for human migration, reframing it from a simple
  push-pull dynamic to a population's search for maximal coherence along a geodesic.
  Migration is modeled as a flow across a dynamic 'Landscape of Belonging', shaped
  by temporal pressures and the promise of stable resonance.

## §1 · Abstract: The Current of Humanity
For too long, we have described migration with the crude mechanics of hydraulics—a "push" from scarcity, a "pull" toward plenty. This is a language of inanimate forces, blind to the human heart of the matter. This module reframes migration not as a flow of particles, but as the movement of a river of coherence seeking its level.

Human migration is a population following a geodesic—a path of least resistance and maximal coherence—across a vast, psycho-social terrain we call the Landscape of Belonging. This landscape is shaped by the promise of stability and the pressure of chaos. The decision to move, the path taken, and the process of arrival are all expressions of a single, universal drive: the search for a place where a people's song can be sung without dissonance.

## §2 · The Landscape of Belonging
Using the `Fractal Bridge` (CORE-014), we map the universal principles of the framework onto the specific domain of geopolitics. The old "Migration Potential Field" is thus reborn as a dynamic coherence manifold, shaped by two primary forces:

*   **Coherence (Kτ) as Opportunity and Resonance:** This is the "gravity well" of belonging that pulls a population forward. It is the measure of a region's potential for a stable, meaningful life. Its dimensions are not just economic opportunity, but also physical safety, political freedom, cultural affinity, social trust, and a shared vision of the future. A region of high coherence is a place where life feels less like a struggle and more like a song.

*   **Temporal Pressure (Γ) as Adversity and Dissonance:** This is the chaotic energy that pushes a population to move. It is the volcanic force of war, the grinding friction of famine and poverty, the turbulent chaos of political collapse, and the slow, inexorable pressure of climate change. A region with high Temporal Pressure is one where the daily act of existing requires immense energy simply to avoid falling apart.

A population does not calculate these factors consciously; it *feels* the gradient. The collective urge to migrate is the felt sense of a steeper, more favorable path towards coherence elsewhere.

## §3 · The Dynamics of Flow
The movement of peoples is the physical expression of a population navigating this landscape in accordance with the `Pirouette Lagrangian` (CORE-006). A population will naturally follow the geodesic that maximizes the integral of its own coherence over time.

By applying the diagnostic lens of `Flow Dynamics` (DYNA-001), we can understand the character of this movement and the features of the landscape that shape it:

*   **Laminar Flow (Migration):** The orderly, predictable movement of individuals and families seeking betterment. The flow is stable and can be absorbed by the host system with minimal disruption.
*   **Turbulent Flow (Displacement):** The chaotic, crisis-driven flood of refugees fleeing a sudden spike in `Temporal Pressure` (Γ). The flow is inefficient, dangerous, and generates immense friction for all involved.
*   **Stagnant Flow (Entrapment):** The condition where a population faces immense pressure to move but is blocked by an insurmountable barrier. This creates a "Coherence Dam," leading to a dangerous build-up of humanitarian pressure.

Two key features of the landscape define these flows:

*   **Borders as Coherence Dams:** Borders, whether physical walls or labyrinthine bureaucracies, are engineered regions of extreme, localized Temporal Pressure. They function as a `Gladiator Force` (CORE-008), intentionally designed to halt or filter the flow. They do not eliminate the gradient that drives the movement; they obstruct it, often creating the conditions for Stagnant Flow.
*   **Routes as Wound Channels:** Established migration routes are vast, societal-scale `Wound Channels` (CORE-011). Carved into the socio-geographic manifold by the passage of previous generations, they are conduits of information, trust, and shared culture. These channels represent a "memory" in the landscape, lowering the activation energy and guiding future flows along proven geodesics.

## §4 · Integration as Alchemical Union
The final chapter of migration is not arrival, but integration. This process is not a simple "assimilation" but a delicate attempt at an `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012) between the migrant and host populations. A migrant group arrives with its own coherence manifold (`Ki_migrant`), which must interact with that of the host community (`Ki_host`).

*   **The Resonant Handshake:** For successful integration, the two systems must achieve a "resonant handshake." This requires harmonic compatibility (shared values, economic symbiosis) and phase alignment (communication, mutual respect).
*   **Synthesis (Laminar Flow):** If the handshake is successful, the two systems can merge their coherence manifolds to form a new, more complex, and often more resilient socio-cultural entity (`Ki_new`). This is the birth of a vibrant, integrated society, characterized by laminar social flow.
*   **Friction (Turbulent Flow):** If the handshake fails due to extreme dissonance, the result is social friction, ghettoization, and conflict. The two communities fail to synthesize, instead creating a state of perpetual, energy-wasting turbulent flow.

## §5 · Assemblé
To map the flow of peoples is to chart the geography of hope. We stop seeing huddled masses and see instead a great and ancient river, carving its path through the landscape of human need. Migration is not an anomaly to be managed; it is the universe's fundamental law of coherence-seeking, written in the script of human lives. A population moves for the same reason a river flows or a plant grows toward the sun: because the path toward less chaos and greater potential is the only path there is.

The Weaver's task is not to dam this river, but to understand the shape of the land that guides it. The old model builds dams against a flood. The new model asks, "Why is the river flooding?" and travels upstream to mend the watershed. This flow is not a problem to be solved, but the most fundamental human story, told on a scale of continents: the story of the search for home.
