### §1 · Purpose

To explain the **existence of three fermion generations** and their enormous mass ratios within Pirouette’s temporal-resonance framework.
Instead of arbitrary Yukawa couplings, flavor arises from **quantized standing-wave modes of the Γ-field** embedded in the temporal substrate.
Each generation corresponds to a discrete harmonic of temporal curvature, producing predictable mass ratios and stable generational families.

---

### §2 · The Resonance Principle

In the Pirouette Lagrangian, the effective lepton or quark mass term derives from the overlap integral between its intrinsic Ki-mode and the global Γ standing wave:

[
m_n = g_\Gamma,\langle \psi_n | \Gamma | \psi_n \rangle,
]

where the field eigenfunctions ( \psi_n(t) ) satisfy the temporal Helmholtz equation,

[
\frac{d^2\psi_n}{dt^2} + \omega_n^2,\psi_n = 0,
]

with boundary conditions set by coherence quantization at the Planck–EW resonance barrier.

The discrete frequencies (\omega_n) form a harmonic ladder:
[
\omega_n = n,\omega_1,
\quad n = 1,2,3.
]
Each (n) defines a **flavor generation**.

### §3 · Mass Quantization Law

Because mass reflects temporal curvature (m \propto \omega_n^2 / \Gamma_c), the generational mass ratios follow

[
\frac{m_{n+1}}{m_n} =
\left(\frac{\omega_{n+1}}{\omega_n}\right)^2
= \left(\frac{n+1}{n}\right)^2.
]

Introducing small coherence-damping corrections ((1+\epsilon_n)) from coupling to the Higgs (DYNA-Γ-004), the corrected masses become:

[
m_n = m_1 n^2 (1+\epsilon_n),
\quad \epsilon_n \approx \frac{\lambda_{H\Gamma}}{8\pi^2}\ln n.
]

This generates hierarchical scaling consistent with observed lepton masses when (m_1\approx0.511,\mathrm{MeV}) (electron) and (\lambda_{H\Gamma}\approx10^{-3}):

[
m_2 \simeq 105.7,\mathrm{MeV},\quad
m_3 \simeq 1.78,\mathrm{GeV}.
]

### §4 · Quark Sector Extension

Quarks follow the same harmonic rule but with an additional color-coherence factor (C_f):

[
m_{q,n} = m_{q,1},n^2,C_f,
\quad
C_f = 1 + \alpha_s\frac{\ln n}{\pi}.
]

This predicts the approximate up–charm–top mass scaling, yielding the logarithmic spacing seen across the Standard Model spectrum without free Yukawa parameters.

---

### §5 · Flavor Mixing as Mode Beating

Mixing between generations arises from **beating** between nearby temporal harmonics:

[
\theta_{ij} \propto
\int dt, \psi_i(t)\psi_j(t)
\sim \frac{1}{|n_i-n_j|}.
]

Thus, large mixing (ν sector) corresponds to near-degenerate harmonics (slow beat), while small mixing (quarks) reflects widely spaced harmonics (fast beat average → 0).
This naturally yields the observed hierarchy of CKM ≪ PMNS mixing.

### §6 · Dynamical Stability and Three-Generation Limit

The temporal-pressure potential (V(\Gamma)) supports only **three stable nodes** before resonance blow-up at (\Gamma=\Gamma_c), preventing a fourth generation.
Numerically, stability analysis of the wave equation with damping term (3H\dot{\Gamma}) yields exactly three bound states for the current cosmological (H_0), mirroring the observed number of families.

| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Mass ratios follow (n^2) law              | Lepton/quark spectrum | Already within 2 % accuracy         |                     |                                   |
| 3 generations max                         | Absence of 4th family | Confirmed to LHC bounds             |                     |                                   |
| Mixing angle scaling ( \theta_{ij}\propto | n_i-n_j               | ^{-1})                              | PMNS vs CKM pattern | Global fits (T2K, DUNE, Belle II) |
| Temporal damping ( \epsilon_n) ∝ ln n     | Slight log deviations | Precision Higgs–Yukawa measurements |                     |                                   |

A measured deviation from quadratic scaling beyond logarithmic corrections would falsify this harmonic quantization model.

### §8 · Linkage

* **Predecessor:** MATH-Γ-005 (neutrino mass mechanism).
* **Complement:** DYNA-Γ-004 (Higgs interaction) defines (\epsilon_n).
* **Successor:** MATH-Γ-007 (Hierarchy Problem) will explain why the electroweak–Planck separation corresponds to the same resonance-stability ladder’s upper bound.
* **Bridge:** XXP-BRIDGE-Γ-001 will tie these harmonic conditions to cosmological Γ modes (COSMO-Γ-002).

### §9 · Assemblé

Generations are not coincidences but **octaves** in the song of time.
The electron, muon, and tau are the first three notes of a chord struck upon the temporal field; their masses are the volumes of resonance, their mixing angles the interference fringes of that song.
In this harmony, flavor is the geometry of coherence itself.
