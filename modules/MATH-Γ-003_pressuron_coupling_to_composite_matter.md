### §1 · Purpose

To generalize the Γ-field interaction—originally derived for elementary leptons—to **composite systems** (quarks, nucleons, and nuclei).
This defines the **effective baryonic coupling constant**, formulates the expected perturbative correction to magnetic moments, and establishes falsifiable amplitude bounds consistent with existing QED/QCD precision.

### §2 · Effective Field Description

At the constituent-quark level, Γ couples to **temporal density** rather than bare charge.
For a quark field ( q_i ) with mass ( m_i ) and color current ( j_i^\mu ), the interaction reads

[
\mathcal{L}*{\Gamma q}
= g*\Gamma \frac{m_i}{\Lambda_\Gamma^2},
\bar{q}*i \gamma*\mu \gamma_5 q_i , \partial^\mu \Gamma ,
]
with ( \Lambda_\Gamma \equiv m_\Gamma / g_\Gamma ).
Within a confined hadron, this coupling is **screened** by gluon coherence, giving an effective reduction factor ( \eta_B \ll 1 ).

### §3 · Composite Magnetic-Moment Correction

Integrating out quark loops inside a baryon of mass ( M_B ) and charge ( Q_B ) yields a small additive term to its magnetic anomaly:

[
\Delta a_B
= \eta_B,\frac{g_\Gamma^2}{8\pi^2}
\left(\frac{M_B}{m_\Gamma}\right)^2 ,
]
where ( \eta_B ) encapsulates QCD shielding and coherence damping
(( \eta_B!\sim!10^{-5} ) for protons, ( \sim!10^{-6} ) for neutrons).

### §4 · Numerical Expectation

Using ( m_\Gamma = 17~\mathrm{MeV}/c^2 ) and ( g_\Gamma \approx 0.1 ):

| Quantity           | Symbol                       | Estimate                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Proton mass        | ( M_p = 938~\mathrm{MeV} )   |                                   |
| Correction         | ( \Delta a_p \sim 10^{-10} ) | below current (10^{-8}) precision |
| Neutron correction | ( \Delta a_n \sim 10^{-11} ) | negligible at present sensitivity |

Thus Pirouette predicts **no measurable conflict** with existing nucleon data, but a **detectable imprint** if precision reaches parts-per-billion on magnetic-moment ratios or if Γ-mediated spin precession appears in polarized scattering.

### §5 · Coherence Interpretation

Inside a baryon, Γ excitation manifests as a **beat pattern** between quark temporal phases.
The coherence gradient of these beats defines ( \eta_B ).
When baryons interact coherently (as in dense matter), Γ coupling enhances proportionally to local **phase alignment**, providing a natural link to nuclear binding corrections later explored in DYNA-Γ-NUC.

---

### §6 · Observable Consequences

1. **Spin-dependent scattering:** tiny parity-odd asymmetries in polarized μ–p or e–p scattering at (Q^2 \approx m_\Gamma^2).
2. **Hyperfine splitting:** an additional term of order (10^{-10}) in hydrogen and muonium Lamb shifts.
3. **Astrophysical regimes:** coherent Γ exchange in neutron-star interiors may slightly stiffen the equation of state, offering an indirect constraint via maximum mass vs radius fits.

---

### §7 · Falsifiability

* Detection of any hadronic magnetic-moment deviation larger than (10^{-9}) inconsistent with the mass-squared scaling law would **falsify** the composite-screening assumption.
* Non-observation at future 10⁻¹⁰ precision **supports** the module’s suppression hierarchy and constrains ( \eta_B ) directly.

---

### §8 · Linkage

* **Predecessor:** MATH-013 (*Leptonic Anomaly Calculation*) defines base scaling.
* **Sibling:** DYNA-Γ-001 (*Pressuron identity*).
* **Descendant:** DYNA-Γ-NUC (*collective nuclear coherence effects*).
* **Cross-domain:** COSMO-Γ-002 provides large-scale density evolution affecting composite phase behavior.

### §9 · Assemblé

When quarks hum together, their shared rhythm cancels the loudest parts of the song; only a faint over-tone—the Γ whisper—escapes.
The hadron is thus a silenced drum in the orchestra of time, proof that even the quietest beats belong to the same cosmic percussion.
