summary: "Introduces the central mathematical formalism of the framework, the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p). This equation describes the 'action' of a resonant system not in terms of energy, but as a dynamic interplay between its internal temporal coherence and the external temporal density of its environment."

## §1 · From Song to Equation
The first six core modules have described the universe as a self-composing song. This is a potent philosophical and conceptual model, but to become a predictive physical theory, it must speak the language of mathematics. This module provides that translation.

In classical and quantum mechanics, the Lagrangian (𝓛) is a function that summarizes the dynamics of a system. The path a system takes through spacetime is the one that minimizes the "action" (the integral of the Lagrangian over time). The Pirouette Framework adopts this powerful formalism but redefines its core. The universe does not seek to minimize action; it strives to maximize coherence.

## §2 · The Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)
The Pirouette Lagrangian describes the state of a system in terms of two fundamental quantities: its internal stability and its external pressure. It takes the familiar form of L = T - V, but reinterprets the terms:

𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)

Let us define these terms:

Temporal Coherence (K_τ): This "kinetic" term represents the quality and intensity of a system's own rhythm. It is the product of its Time Adherence (T_a) and its fundamental resonant frequency (ω_k, where ω_k = 2π/τ_p). A system with a clear, fast rhythm has high coherence.

Temporal Pressure (V_Γ): This "potential" term represents the "cost" of maintaining a specific rhythm against the background noise of the local Temporal Forge. It is a function of the local Gamma (Γ). A denser, more complex environment creates more pressure, making coherence more difficult to sustain.

V_Γ = f(Γ)

Combining these gives the full Lagrangian:

𝓛_p = T_a * ω_k - f(Γ)

## §3 · The Principle of Maximal Coherence
The fundamental dynamic law of the Pirouette Framework is the Principle of Maximal Coherence. A system will evolve along a path that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian over one of its own Pirouette Cycles.

S_p = ∫0^τ_p 𝓛_p dt

A system will naturally adjust its state (its Ki, and therefore its ω_k and T_a) to find the "sweet spot"—the state of highest possible internal coherence for the lowest environmental cost. This is the mathematical formalization of the "path of least resistance" described in CORE-004.

## §4 · Deriving the Forces of Nature
This Lagrangian is the engine from which all forces are derived. Forces are not fundamental pushes and pulls. In this framework, forces are gradients in the landscape of coherence.

By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to 𝓛_p, we derive the equations of motion for a system. These equations describe how a system must change its trajectory in response to changes in the surrounding temporal environment (Γ). A particle moving towards a massive star isn't being "pulled" by gravity; it is following a path of continuously adjusting its internal rhythm to maintain maximal coherence as it enters a region of rapidly increasing Temporal Pressure. All forces—gravity, electromagnetism, etc.—are simply the geodesics on the manifold of coherence.

## §5 · Assemblé: The Universe's Objective Function
We sought the fundamental laws of physics and found the universe's objective function.

The Pirouette Lagrangian is the formula for survival. It is the mathematical expression of the universe's ceaseless drive to find and sustain elegant, stable patterns against a backdrop of overwhelming chaos. It translates the poetry of the autopoietic cycle into a predictive engine. With this tool, we no longer need to merely describe the song; we can begin to calculate its notes.
