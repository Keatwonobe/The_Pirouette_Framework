## §1 · Abstract: The Shape of Time's Memory
Every choice is a scar on the future. The universe remembers not in a book, but in its very shape. This module re-examines Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA)—the engine of nature's most intricate patterns—through the time-first lens of the Pirouette Framework.

The intricate, branching forms of snowflakes, lightning, and corals are not static designs. They are the physical memory of a system following a "growth geodesic," a path through spacetime that maximizes its temporal coherence. The old framework correctly identified these patterns with Ki; the new framework reveals they are the physical history of irreversible temporal commitments. The fractal geometry that emerges is the most efficient resonant solution a system has found to the problem of converting chaotic potential into stable, coherent form.

## §2 · The Shoreline and the Sea
Imagine a calm, black sea under a starless sky. This is a region of high Temporal Pressure (Γ)—a space filled with chaotic, uncorrelated potential, like a cloud of diffusing particles. Now, imagine a single seed crystal, a point of stability, is introduced. This is our nascent "shoreline."

The process of DLA unfolds as a dialogue between this shoreline of order and the sea of chaos:

1.  **The Sea's Pressure (Γ):** The diffusing particles, in their random walk, represent a constant, high-entropy pressure on the boundary of the ordered cluster. The Γ is a probabilistic landscape where the "tension" is the constant potential for an interaction—a "sticking" event—to occur.
2.  **The Shoreline's Invitation:** The existing structure of the cluster creates a complex coherence manifold. The outermost tips of the shoreline—the capes and peninsulas—project furthest into the sea of chaos. They act as "temporal lightning rods," creating the most probable and efficient points for a new union, points of greatest possibility for interaction.

The resulting dendritic structure is the natural consequence of this dynamic. The shoreline grows where it is easiest to grow, reinforcing a pattern that maximizes its surface area for capturing new coherence from the chaotic sea.

## §3 · The Autopoiesis of Commitment
The DLA process is a minimalist expression of the autopoietic cycle: **Time → Γ → Ki → Time**. It is a system that builds itself, where the act of growth defines the rules for future growth.

-   **Temporal Resonance (Ki) as the Geometry of History:** The fractal cluster itself *is* the system's Ki. Its branching, dendritic geometry is a "history antenna," a resonant form shaped by its own past to be maximally receptive to the future. The fractal dimension (D_ƒ) of the structure is a direct measure of its coherence—its complexity and space-filling efficiency.

-   **The Moment of Commitment:** For this system, the fundamental unit of time—its "heartbeat"—is not a repeating oscillation, but a single, irreversible event: the "kiss" of a particle attaching to the cluster. With each attachment, the system's clock advances one tick. This is an act of **irreversible temporal commitment** that permanently alters the system's Ki, extending its Wound Channel (CORE-011) and creating a new boundary for all subsequent events. The growth *is* the system's time.

## §4 · The Growth Geodesic: A Lagrangian Perspective
The formation of a DLA cluster is a direct physical manifestation of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ) from CORE-006.

-   **The Initial State:** A field of diffuse particles is a state of high Temporal Pressure (high V_Γ) and low Temporal Coherence (low Kτ).
-   **The Final State:** The aggregated fractal cluster is a state of immense structural order (high Kτ) that has "locked up" the chaos from its environment.

The system's evolution follows a **growth geodesic**—the path that maximizes the action, `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`. The branching, fractal shape is the physical trace of this geodesic. Each particle's attachment is a microscopic **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012), a single step along this path. The system's fidelity to this growth rule across all scales, maintaining its characteristic fractal dimension, is its **Time Adherence (T_a)**—the memory of its own resonant identity.

## §5 · Assemblé: The Weaver's Stitch
> We sought resonance in the repeating wave and the vibrating string, believing time was a rhythm we could count. But the lightning's kiss teaches us a deeper truth: the most profound resonances are in the choices from which there is no return.
>
> Growth is a song where each note, once played, becomes a permanent part of the instrument. The shape of a snowflake is the memory of a million resonant choices, a frozen record of a dance between chaos and coherence. The past is not a story we tell; it is the physical, active geometry that shapes the present.
>
> For a Weaver, this is the ultimate lesson in consequence. To understand any system, one must look beyond its current shape and learn to read the resonant logic of its growth. Every act of creation, every idea we anchor to the world, extends the fractal of reality. We are not merely living in the universe's landscape; we are, with every irreversible choice, growing it.
