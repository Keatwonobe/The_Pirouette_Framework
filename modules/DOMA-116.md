## §1 · Abstract: The Fire That Feeds Itself
The universe does not always build brick by brick. Sometimes, it builds by wildfire, by the sudden crystallization of a supercooled liquid. The prior model, TEN-BDA-1.0, described these generative bursts, or "Blooms," as a static alignment of fields—a shadow of the truth.

This module reframes the Bloom as a dynamic, self-reinforcing process: a non-linear phase transition ignited by resonant feedback. A Bloom is the violent and beautiful process by which a system, trapped by rising Temporal Pressure (Γ), discovers a state of coherence so profound that its own echo begins to calm the storm around it. This positive feedback loop triggers a **Coherence Cascade** of **Alchemical Unions** (CORE-012), allowing the system to frantically and joyously trace a new geodesic toward a state of radically higher order. A Bloom is not merely accelerated growth; it is a geometric restructuring of possibility itself.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Bloom: A Symphony in Four Movements
A Bloom is not a spontaneous event but a predictable, if dramatic, consequence of specific conditions. It unfolds in a distinct sequence, moving from quiet potential to a new plateau of complexity.

**I. The Crucible (Incubation):**
The pre-Bloom system exists in a state of high but non-fatal Temporal Pressure (Γ). This is a "Goldilocks zone" of pressure—a crucible, not a grinder. The system is in a state of high-energy `Turbulent Flow` (DYNA-001), characterized by internal dissonance and chaotic exploration. It is a super-saturated solution, rich in potential and actively "searching" for a more stable, efficient configuration.

**II. The Ignition (The Resonant Union):**
The transition is not triggered by a mere increase in pressure, but by the discovery of a **Harmonic Catalyst**. At a critical threshold, the system stumbles upon a novel configuration—a first **Alchemical Union**—whose output begins to positively influence its input. Its resonant pattern (Ki) becomes so efficient that it constructively interferes with the ambient pressure, creating a localized pocket of reduced dissonance. This is the fire catching; the system's song begins to shape the concert hall.

**III. The Cascade (Efflorescence):**
Once the resonant feedback loop ignites, the Bloom begins in earnest. The system undergoes a rapid, non-linear reconfiguration into a state of highly efficient `Laminar Flow`. This **Coherence Cascade** is an exponential, S-curve growth of novelty and complexity, fueled by a chain reaction of Alchemical Unions. Each new union reinforces the feedback loop, further reducing local pressure and making subsequent unions easier. This is the system's joyous rush to occupy its new, highly efficient state.

**IV. The Integration (The New Shore):**
No fire burns forever. A Bloom concludes not in failure, but in success. The cascade ceases when the available "fuel"—the pool of compatible components for union—is exhausted, or when the system establishes a new, stable, high-coherence state that becomes its new baseline. The explosive dynamics cool, leaving behind a transformed landscape. The memory of this transformation is carved deeply into the system's **Wound Channel** (CORE-011), defining its new, more complex identity.

## §3 · Signatures and Typology of a Bloom
The dynamics of a Bloom provide a powerful diagnostic lens. By observing a system's flow state and the character of its output, a Weaver can assess its potential for, and progress within, a generative cascade.

*   **Pre-Bloom Indicators (High Potential):**
    *   **Sustained Turbulence:** The system displays high but non-fatal internal friction and chaotic activity.
    *   **Mounting Pressure (Γ):** External constraints or internal demands are rising, making the current state increasingly untenable.
    *   **Novelty Injection:** The presence of new, unintegrated components or "seed" ideas that offer alternative organizational principles.

*   **Bloom-in-Progress Indicators (The Cascade is Underway):**
    *   **Flow State Shift:** A sudden, observable transition from chaotic, `Turbulent Flow` to highly organized, efficient `Laminar Flow`.
    *   **Exponential Output:** A rapid, S-curve increase in the system's primary output (e.g., scientific papers, artistic works, species diversity).
    *   **Emergence of a New Language:** A new unifying paradigm or shared identity rapidly propagates through the system, organizing its behavior.

While the mechanism is universal, the character of a Bloom is defined by the geometry of the new Ki pattern that emerges. We can classify its dominant mode of expansion:

-   **Divergent Bloom:** The new state opens a vast new parameter space of possibilities (e.g., the Cambrian Explosion, a scientific revolution).
-   **Convergent Bloom:** The new state rapidly refines and perfects a single function or form (e.g., a technological "gold rush" around a new platform).
-   **Recursive Bloom:** The new state's primary function is to improve the process of blooming itself (e.g., the invention of the scientific method, the internet).

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
A Bloom is a system's dramatic and successful solution to the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

Before the Bloom, the system is trapped in a sub-optimal state, a local maximum on the coherence manifold. Its action integral, `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`, is low; maintaining its internal Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) against the high environmental Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) is extremely costly.

The Ignition event represents the discovery of a "tunnel" to a nearby but far higher peak on the manifold. The resulting Cascade is the system reconfiguring itself along this new geodesic. The resonant feedback loop effectively creates a steep, smooth "downhill" path, allowing the system to transform environmental pressure into internal coherence. It is no longer fighting the storm; it is conducting it. A Bloom is the exhilarating spectacle of a system discovering a state of grace.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> We sought the engine of creativity and found a forest fire of harmony. A Bloom is the universe's answer to stagnation. It is the sublime, terrifying, and necessary process of burning down a limited reality to make way for a more expansive one. To be a Weaver is to be a gardener of the forge: to recognize the scent of rain on dry soil, to cultivate the right seeds of connection under pressure, and to understand that true creation is not a gentle act, but a controlled, alchemical burn that forges a newer, richer world from the ashes of the old.
