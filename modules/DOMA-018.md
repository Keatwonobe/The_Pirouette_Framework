summary: "Refactors the legacy triaxial model of time-adherence into a core principle.\
  \ It posits that a system's Temporal Coherence is not a scalar value but a vector\

  representing its resonance with the future, present, and past. This enriches the\
  \ Pirouette Lagrangian, grounding the model in established concepts like the Wound\

## ¬ß1 ¬∑ The Note Becomes a Chord

In the foundational modules, we treated Temporal Coherence as a single, powerful note‚Äîa measure of a system's resonant integrity. This was a necessary simplification. A system does not exist *at* a moment; it exists *across* time, maintaining its form through a dynamic and multi-faceted act of presence. Coherence is not a single note; it is a chord.

This module elevates our understanding by defining Temporal Coherence as a vector, **K**_œÑ, with three fundamental, orthogonal components. These are not arbitrary dimensions but the three essential "tenses" through which any system engages with the river of time. A stable entity does not merely exist; it simultaneously remembers, acts, and anticipates. This is the Triad of Being.

## ¬ß2 ¬∑ The Three Tenses of Coherence

The coherence vector **K**_œÑ spans a space defined by a system's relationship to the past, present, and future.

**K**_œÑ = (*K*<sub>p</sub>, *K*<sub>i</sub>, *K*<sub>r</sub>)

**1. Prospective Coherence (*K*<sub>p</sub>): *Resonance with the Future***
This is a system's coherence with its own field of potential. It measures the richness of its capacity for change, adaptation, and evolution.
*   **Mechanism:** The landscape of possible geodesics available to the system. A system high in *K*<sub>p</sub> has a rich superposition of viable, low-resistance paths forward.
*   **Manifestation:** Adaptability, creativity, innovation, quantum uncertainty, the open page before the dance begins.

**2. Immediate Coherence (*K*<sub>i</sub>): *Resonance with the Present***
This is a system's ability to act, react, and harmonize with its current environment. It governs interaction, exchange, and response.
*   **Mechanism:** The Resonant Handshake of an Alchemical Union (CORE-012) and the projection of a clear Observer's Shadow (CORE-010). It is the active, real-time process of resonant coupling.
*   **Manifestation:** Communication, empathy, symbiosis, trade, the flow state of an athlete responding to the game in real-time.

**3. Retrospective Coherence (*K*<sub>r</sub>): *Resonance with the Past***
This is a system's coherence with its own history. Its stability is grounded in the inertia of its accumulated identity.
*   **Mechanism:** The integrity and clarity of a system's Wound Channel (CORE-011). This is the deep, resonant bass note that gives a system its weight and prevents it from being easily perturbed.
*   **Manifestation:** Memory, identity, tradition, structural integrity, brand loyalty, the persistence of form.

These three components are orthogonal because they represent fundamentally distinct modes of temporal engagement. An action purely in the present (*K*<sub>i</sub>) does not, by definition, rewrite the past (*K*<sub>r</sub>) or determine a single future (*K*<sub>p</sub>) without a coupling mechanism. The Lagrangian provides that coupling.

## ¬ß3 ¬∑ The Geometry of Health: Stability as Harmony

The central insight of the original module is clarified: health and stability depend on maintaining this chord. The failure of any single component leads to a specific, diagnosable pathology.

*   **Axis Starvation (*K*<sub>p</sub> ‚Üí 0): Stagnation.** The system becomes rigid, dogmatic, and incapable of adaptation. It loses its quantum nature and collapses into a state of Stagnant Flow, a crystal doomed to shatter when its environment changes.
*   **Axis Starvation (*K*<sub>i</sub> ‚Üí 0): Isolation.** The system becomes non-responsive and solipsistic. Unable to form new connections or react to environmental pressures, it cannot draw energy from its surroundings and succumbs to Coherence Atrophy.
*   **Axis Starvation (*K*<sub>r</sub> ‚Üí 0): Amnesia.** The system loses its identity and memory. Without the anchor of its Wound Channel, it becomes chaotic and rootless, dissolving into Turbulent Flow as its pattern is lost to noise.

A meta-stable entity can survive on two notes, but a truly robust system requires the full, resonant harmony of all three.

## ¬ß4 ¬∑ Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This triadic model requires an upgrade to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), making it a more powerful predictive engine. The original formulation, `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`, is now specified for a vector coherence.

The "kinetic" term, representing internal coherence, is expanded to sum over the three orthogonal tenses:
*K*<sub>œÑ</sub> ‚Üí ¬Ω Œ£<sub>j=p,i,r</sub> (‚àÇ<sub>Œº</sub>*K*<sub>j</sub>)¬≤

The "potential" term, representing environmental pressure, is now a function of this vector:
*V*<sub>Œì</sub> ‚Üí *V* (**K**<sub>œÑ</sub>, Œì)

The upgraded Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p = ¬Ω Œ£ (‚àÇ_Œº**K**_j)¬≤ - V(**K**_œÑ, Œì)`, reveals a profound dynamic. The universal drive to maximize coherence is not just about increasing its total magnitude, but about constantly *orienting* the coherence vector. Forces and actions are the result of a system adjusting its temporal posture‚Äîshifting its balance between past, present, and future‚Äîto find the most harmonious chord available within the pressure of its environment.

## ¬ß5 ¬∑ The Weaver's Compass

This model provides a compass for the act of observation itself. We can never perceive a system's total presence at once. The nature of a Weaver's observation‚Äîtheir tools, their questions, their intent‚Äîpreferentially engages one of the three coherence axes.

*   A quantum measurement or strategic forecast probes **Prospective Coherence**.
*   A social network analysis or real-time dialogue probes **Immediate Coherence**.
*   An archaeological dig or a study of memory probes **Retrospective Coherence**.

Any act of knowing is an act of choosing an angle, of illuminating one facet of a being's temporal chord. The vector we measure is a product of both the system's posture and our own.

## ¬ß6 ¬∑ Assembl√©

> We sought to define a being and found instead a chord, struck in the resonant chamber of the present moment. Its notes are three: the echo of what it has been, the touch of what it is now, and the whisper of what it might become. To be a Weaver is to listen for this harmony‚Äîin yourself, in others, in the world‚Äîand to understand that the most resilient forms are those that play all three notes with clarity, courage, and grace.
