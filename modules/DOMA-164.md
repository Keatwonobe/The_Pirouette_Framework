## §1 · Abstract: Trading Form for Rhythm
The universe is an artist of profound efficiency. When a complex form is no longer the most elegant solution to its environment, it does not discard its complexity; it translates it. This module describes a fundamental process of such a translation, previously termed a dimensional collapse, now understood as a dimensional unfolding.

This phenomenon is a phase transition driven by the relentless search for maximal coherence. It occurs when a system in a low-pressure environment (`Γ`) finds a more efficient path to stability. It trades a complex, static, multi-polar symmetry for a simpler, bipolar form that expresses the "lost" dimension's information as a stable, coherent temporal oscillation. This is not a loss of information, but its reconfiguration—the transformation of a silent sculpture into a resonant melody.

## §2 · The Lagrangian Drive for Coherence
This process is a direct and elegant consequence of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`), which states that all systems evolve along geodesics that maximize their net coherence. The Lagrangian can be expressed as:

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Where `K_τ` is the system's internal Temporal Coherence (its resonant stability and intensity), and `V_Γ` is the cost of maintaining that coherence against external Temporal Pressure. A more precise formulation defines `K_τ` as the product of Time Adherence and frequency (`T_a * ω_k`) and `V_Γ` as a cost function of pressure (`f(Γ)`).

-   **The Precursor State (Brittle Coherence):** Consider a system with a complex, static, 3-fold symmetric internal geometry (`Ki`). This form may be highly coherent in a high-pressure, chaotic (`high-Γ`) environment. However, in a quiet, low-pressure (`low-Γ`) environment, this intricate structure becomes "over-engineered" and energetically expensive. The cost to sustain it (`V_Γ`), while small, is unnecessary, making the pattern dissonant with its surroundings and yielding a low `𝓛_p`. It is a state of high tension—an orchestra playing a symphony in an empty hall.

-   **The Unfolded State (Resonant Coherence):** The system can find a state of higher net coherence (`𝓛_p`) by simplifying its spatial form to a 2-fold pattern and expressing the remaining complexity as a rhythm. The new state has a simpler spatial `Ki` but now possesses a stable, coherent resonant frequency (`ω_k`). This dynamic state is far less costly to maintain in the low-`Γ` environment (`V_Γ` approaches zero). The system has optimized itself by becoming a musician, finding that a simple, ringing note is a more coherent solution than a silent, complex sculpture.

## §3 · The Anatomy of Unfolding
The transformation is not a violent break, but a graceful, controlled unraveling governed by the local physics of time.

-   **Trigger Condition:** A persistent state of low Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). The environmental noise floor must be low enough that a pure, sustained oscillation is a viable and stable pattern. The universe must be quiet enough to hear a single note.

-   **The Unfolding:** One of the system's three spatial degrees of freedom "unfolds" into its Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`). The energy and information bound within that structural component are not dissipated as chaotic heat but are conserved, becoming the driving momentum for the new, simpler pattern. The information previously encoded in the spatial dimension—its extent, its phase relationships—is now imprinted onto the properties of the new oscillation.

-   **The Resultant Rhythm:** The new `Ki` is a dynamic, oscillatory pattern. Its high Time Adherence (`T_a`) signifies that this is not decay into chaos, but a transition into a new, stable, resonant ground state. The system is not breaking; it is beginning to sing.

## §4 · From Spatial Form to Temporal Identity
The core insight of this modernized view is that the emergent oscillation is not merely a carrier of encoded information; the new rhythm *is* the information. The system's identity fundamentally shifts from its shape to its song. This new identity is defined by the rich characteristics of its resonance:

*   **Frequency (`ω_k`)**: The fundamental pitch of the new entity, determined by the energy conserved from the unfolded state.
*   **Amplitude**: The intensity of the resonance, its "volume."
*   **Temporal Coherence (`T_a`)**: The purity and stability of the rhythm. A successful unfolding results in a state of very high `T_a`—a clear, unwavering note.

The entity's Wound Channel (CORE-011) is likewise transformed. It no longer leaves the static impression of a complex shape in the coherence manifold, but the persistent, rhythmic pulse of its new song. Its memory becomes a beat.

## §5 · Diagnostic Signatures for the Weaver
A Weaver can identify this process by observing a clear set of signatures, moving from a static analysis of form to a dynamic analysis of rhythm.

1.  **Environmental Quiescence:** The first clue is the context. The system must inhabit a region of low `Γ`. Look for this phenomenon in the calm shallows of the cosmic river, not its turbulent rapids.
2.  **Symmetry Reconfiguration:** The primary evidence is a spontaneous shift from a static, 3-fold (or multi-polar) geometry to a dynamic, 2-fold (bipolar) oscillation. Centered, stable patterns give way to alternating, rhythmic ones.
3.  **Coherent Rhythmicity:** The emergent oscillation must be stable and pure. Using frequency analysis, a Weaver can confirm the new rhythm is a sharp, well-defined peak in the system's temporal signature, not a broad spectrum of noise. This confirms the transition is to a new coherent state, fulfilling the drive of the Lagrangian.
4.  **Information Conservation:** The most subtle sign is that the complexity of the new rhythm (its modulation, amplitude, and harmonic content) appears to account for the complexity of the lost spatial dimension. The pattern has not become simpler overall; its complexity has merely changed its medium of expression.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We are taught to map the world, to measure its forms and fix its coordinates. But the universe is a thrifty composer; it wastes no dimension. The Unfolding Dimension reveals that a line on a map can be traded for a beat in a measure. It shows that when a structure is broken under shifting pressures, its essence is not lost but reborn in a more elegant form, its silent complexity transformed into a vibrant, living rhythm. It teaches the Weaver that to truly understand a system, one must not only look at its shape but also listen for the music that rises from its ruins, for it is often the truest and most enduring part of what was.
