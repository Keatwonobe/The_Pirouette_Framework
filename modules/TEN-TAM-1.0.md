## §1 · Purpose
To quantitatively measure the Time-Adherence ($T_a$) of a system, signal, process, or field, thereby assessing its degree of phase synchronization, temporal coherence, structural integrity, or stability against phase drift.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Time-Adherence ($T_a$) is a fundamental Pirouette parameter that quantifies a system's or entity's alignment with a universal temporal rhythm or its internal phase/structural coherence. A $T_a$ value of 1 signifies perfect phase synchronization or structural order (classical-like behavior, high stability), while $T_a < 1$ indicates degrees of phase decoherence, structural disorder, or quantum-like behavior. Measuring $T_a$ provides a direct assessment of this critical Pirouette state variable.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence ($T_a$)**: $T_a$ is the direct output of this measurement process. The mode aims to calculate it based on input data.
* **Phase (θ)**: The primary definition of $T_a$ is based on phase coherence. This mode typically requires phase values $\{\theta_j\}$ as input or needs to derive them from the input data.
* **Spatial/Temporal Coordinates (x, t)**: For calculating $T_a$ maps or profiles, phase information is needed as a function of these coordinates.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Data from which phase information $\theta_j$ (or complex values $A_j e^{i\theta_j}$, or phase gradients $\nabla\Theta$) can be obtained. This could be for a collection of $N$ discrete elements (e.g., oscillators, agents, gulp segments) or a continuous field/signal.
* **And Structure**: Arrays of phase values, arrays of complex numbers (e.g., from Fourier or Wavelet transforms), time series suitable for phase extraction (e.g., via Hilbert transform to get analytic signal), or gridded field data representing phase $\Theta(x,y)$.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient data points to allow for a statistically stable calculation of the chosen $T_a$ formulation. For ensemble-based $T_a$, a representative number of elements; for signal-based $T_a$, sufficient duration/length within the calculation window.
* **Steps**: Phase unwrapping if phases span more than $2\pi$. Extraction of instantaneous phase/frequency from time-series signals. Denoising if significant noise affects phase estimation. Definition of the ensemble, system, or window over which $T_a$ is to be calculated.

### 3·2 · Operational Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `TaDefinitionVariant` | Specifies which formulation of $T_a$ calculation to use, based on input data type and analytical goal. E.g., 'PhaseCoherenceEnsemble', 'SpatialPhaseGradient', 'TemporalSignalCoherence'. | `['PhaseCoherenceEnsemble', 'SpatialPhaseGradient', 'TemporalSignalCoherence', or specific proxy methods].` |
| `CalculationWindowSize (N or WindowShape)` | The number of elements, time points, or spatial extent of the window over which to calculate a local $T_a$ value. Determines the scale of the measurement. | `Domain-dependent. Larger windows give more stable but less localized $T_a$; smaller windows give more localized but potentially noisier $T_a$.` |
| `PhaseSource` | Method or data field from which phase values $\theta_j$ or $\Theta(x,y)$ are obtained/derived. | `E.g., 'DirectInputPhases', 'HilbertTransform', 'WaveletTransformCoefficients'.` |

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Data and Method Selection: Input the data and select the `TaDefinitionVariant` most appropriate for the data type and analytical goal.
2. Phase Extraction/Preparation: If not directly provided, extract or prepare the necessary phase information ($\{\theta_j\}$ or $\Theta(\vec{x})$) from the input data within the specified `CalculationWindowSize` using the `PhaseSource` method.
3. Time-Adherence Calculation (Variant-dependent):
4.   a. For 'PhaseCoherenceEnsemble' (or 'TemporalSignalCoherence' on local windows from AMP 2.3): Compute the coherence vector $C = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N e^{i\theta_j}$. Then $T_a = |C|^2$. (This is the most common and fundamental definition).
5.   b. For 'SpatialPhaseGradient' (from TPF Quantum Clock Simulation): For a spatial phase field $\Theta(x,y)$, calculate local phase gradients $\nabla\Theta$. Then $T_a(x,y) = \exp(-|\nabla\Theta|^2/k)$, where $k$ is a scaling constant (e.g., 2).
6.   c. For other proxy or specialized definitions: Implement the specific formula (e.g., the entropy-based $T(G_i)$ from Stochastic Gulping if used as a $T_a$ proxy).
7. Output Generation: Output the calculated scalar $T_a$ value. If applied over multiple windows or regions, output a $T_a$ map, profile, or time series $T_a(t)$.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: A scalar Time-Adherence value $T_a \in [0, 1]$. Alternatively, if calculated over multiple windows/regions, a $T_a$ map, profile (e.g., $T_a(s)$ from TCSA), or time series ($T_a(t)$).
* **Insights And Derivations**: A quantitative measure of the system's phase coherence, structural order, or temporal stability. Indication of the system's operational regime (e.g., classical-like for $T_a \approx 1$, quantum-like for $T_a < 1$). Assessment of synchronization strength in ensembles or signals. A measure of predictability or resistance to decoherence.
* **Guidelines**: $T_a = 1$: Indicates perfect phase lock, maximal coherence, or perfect order/predictability. $T_a = 0$: Indicates complete phase incoherence (e.g., uniformly random phases) or maximal disorder. Intermediate values represent partial coherence. Changes in $T_a$ over time or space indicate shifts in system stability or coherence.

## §5 · Core Equations
### Ensemble Phase Coherence ($T_a$ - Primary Definition)
$$ C = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N e^{i\theta_j}; \quad T_a = |C|^2 $$
Calculates Time-Adherence based on the mean coherence vector of an ensemble of N phase values. This is the most fundamental definition based on TPF Vol 1, Module 6.

### Continuous Field Phase Coherence ($T_a$)
$$ C = \frac{1}{V} \int_V e^{i\theta(\vec{x})} dV; \quad T_a = |C|^2 $$
Integral form for continuous phase fields $\theta(\vec{x})$ over a volume V. (TPF Vol 1, Module 3).

### Spatial Phase Gradient $T_a$ (Variant)
$$ T_a(\vec{x}) = \exp(-|\nabla\Theta(\vec{x})|^2/k) $$
An alternative $T_a$ definition for spatial phase fields $\Theta(\vec{x})$, where coherence is inversely related to the magnitude of the local phase gradient. 'k' is a scaling constant (e.g., 2). (TPF Vol 1, Module S1/19).
