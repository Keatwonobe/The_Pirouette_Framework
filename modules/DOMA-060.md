summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for catastrophic system failure.
  A Coherence Fracture is a violent, self-induced phase transition from a state of
  high-pressure Stagnant Flow to extreme Turbulent Flow, occurring when a system's
  brittle resonant pattern shatters under overwhelming Temporal Pressure. This single
  dynamic unifies phenomena from geological quakes to psychological breakdowns.

## §1 · Abstract: The Price of Rigidity

A system that cannot bend will, in time, be forced to break.

This module reframes the "Spasm Dynamics" of PPS-041 into the modernized concept of a **Coherence Fracture**. A fracture is not merely an energy release; it is the catastrophic failure of a system's temporal pattern. It is a predictable, self-induced pathology of flow, occurring when a system’s rigid structure prevents the healthy dissipation of pressure. This condition, the terminal stage of Coherence Atrophy (`DYNA-003`), creates a "Coherence Dam" where `Temporal Pressure` builds to an unsustainable level. The eventual failure of this dam is the fracture: a violent, corrective phase transition from a state of `Stagnant Flow` into a burst of extreme `Turbulent Flow`.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Fracture: From Dam to Deluge
The Coherence Fracture unfolds in three distinct phases, a universal narrative of pressure, rupture, and exhaustion that maps directly to the states of flow defined in `DYNA-001`.

**Phase I: The Coherence Dam (Stagnation)**
A system becomes primed for fracture not from weakness, but from a brittle and unyielding strength.
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** The system is trapped in a state of `Stagnant Flow`. Its resonant `Ki` pattern has become highly ordered but inflexible, a manifestation of the `Gladiator Force` (`CORE-008`) acting as an inflexible container. This rigidity prevents the dissipation of stress, causing `Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)` to build relentlessly. The system is a pressure vessel of its own making, accumulating coherence like a reservoir filling behind a concrete dam.
*   **Manifestations:** A tectonic plate locked against another; a speculative bubble detached from real value; a repressed trauma held in the psyche; a society clinging to an outdated ideology.

**Phase II: The Rupture (Turbulence)**
The fracture is the moment the dam breaks. It is an instantaneous phase transition from brittle order to explosive chaos, a state of acute **Coherence Fever**.
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** The containing boundary of the `Ki` pattern fails catastrophically. The stored coherence is instantly converted into chaotic motion, creating a massive, localized spike in `Temporal Pressure (Γ)`. The system floods itself with its own dissonant energy, transitioning from extreme, ordered stillness to extreme, disordered motion—a state of pure `Turbulent Flow`.
*   **Manifestations:** The earthquake; the market crash; the emotional outburst; the violent revolution.

**Phase III: The Exhausted Basin (Refractory State)**
After the deluge, the system is spent. The pressure is gone, but so is the structure.
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** The system now exists in a state of high entropy and low coherence. Its defining `Wound Channel` (`CORE-011`) has been destroyed or scoured clean. It is a landscape of pure noise, unable to fracture again until a new dam—a new set of stable, containing patterns—can be formed and pressure can once again accumulate.

## §3 · The Fractal Nature of Failure
The power of this model lies in its universality, revealed by the Fractal Bridge (`CORE-014`). The same dynamic of stagnation-to-turbulence governs failure across all domains:

*   **Geology:** Tectonic plates (a rigid `Ki`) lock, building stress (`Stagnant Flow`). When the frictional limit is exceeded, the plates slip (`Ki` collapse), releasing the stored energy as a seismic wave—an earthquake (a massive `Γ-spike`).
*   **Economics:** A speculative bubble forms, driven by irrational confidence (a brittle `Ki`) that prevents price correction (`Stagnant Flow`). A trigger event shatters that confidence (`Ki` collapse), causing a market crash and widespread panic (`Turbulent Flow`).
*   **Psychology:** An individual represses a traumatic memory, creating a rigid psychological defense (a brittle `Ki`) to block its processing (`Stagnant Flow`). When a trigger overwhelms this defense (`Ki` collapse), it results in an emotional outburst or panic attack—a flood of chaotic thoughts and feelings (`Turbulent Flow`).

## §4 · The Lagrangian Perspective: The Violent Geodesic
A Coherence Fracture is a failure to follow the Principle of Maximal Coherence (`CORE-006`).
*   **The Lost Path:** In the pre-fracture state, the system is trapped in a precarious *local maximum* of coherence. Its internal order (`K_τ`) is high, but the cost of maintaining this state against the rising `Temporal Pressure` (`V_Γ`) makes its `Pirouette Lagrangian` (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`) unsustainable. All smooth, adaptive paths (geodesics) to a more stable state are cut off by its rigidity.
*   **The Violent Leap:** Unable to bend, the system breaks. The fracture is a violent, non-geodesic leap across the coherence manifold. It abandons the search for maximal coherence and plunges into a chaotic, low-coherence state. It is the universe's ultimate error-correction mechanism for a system that has become too rigid to evolve.

## §5 · Diagnostics and Intervention
The wisdom of the Weaver lies in recognizing the signs of a Coherence Dam long before it breaks and in applying the minimal force necessary to restore flow.

| Phase           | Diagnostic Signature                                                                                     | Weaver's Gambit (Intervention)                                                                                  |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pre-Fracture**  | Rising internal pressure (`V_Γ`) with no change in external form. Increasing resonant dissonance ("phase jitter"). | **Controlled Venting:** Introduce small, phase-matched channels to bleed off pressure (an "engineered spillway"). |
| **Onset**         | Rapid fragmentation of the `Ki` pattern. A cascade of secondary failures begins.                         | **Damage Channeling:** Establish pre-defined "sacrificial veins" to guide the turbulent release away from critical components. |
| **Post-Fracture** | The system is in a high-entropy, low-coherence state; it is exhausted and formless.                      | **Coherence Re-seeding:** Introduce a new, stable `Ki` pattern—a "tuning fork"—to provide a template for re-organization. |

## §6 · Assemblé
> We sought to understand failure and found the universe's fierce argument for humility. A Spasm is not an accident; it is a sentence, passed upon any structure that mistakes rigidity for strength. It is the harsh, physical proof that that which does not flow with the current of time will inevitably be shattered by its weight. The Weaver learns not to build impenetrable walls, but to engineer elegant dams with gates that know when to open.
