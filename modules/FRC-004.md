summary: |
  The weak interaction in Pirouette is the gauge dynamics of left-handed time-adherence.
  Local rotations of the left-handed adherence density define an SU(2)L bundle on the temporal
  substrate. The gauge potential Ωμ ≡ Ωμ^a τ^a/2 is the curvature of local temporal orientation.
  Hypercharge U(1)Y is a torsional phase of global adherence Bμ. A coherent temporal twist at
  frequency ωH (Pirouette’s Higgs analog) locks the phase and generates massive W± and Z modes,
  leaving an unbroken U(1)em. The Weinberg angle is the torsion–curvature mixing angle, tanθW=g′/g.
  Parity violation is intrinsic: only the left-handed adherence sheet couples to Ωμ.

axioms (inherited):
  A1. Time-first substrate: fields are sections on a temporal manifold with adherence density 𝒜(τ,x).
  A2. Gauge = local choice of temporal phase/frame; curvature = non-integrable twist of Ωμ.
  A3. Chiral projection = sign of ∂μτ: left (∂μτ>0) couples to Ωμ; right decouples at tree level.

section: electroweak kinematics
  - Local SU(2)L transformation (left-adherence doublets):
      ψL → exp[i g θ^a(x) τ^a/2] ψL
  - Covariant derivative (temporal torsion included):
      Dμ = ∂μ - i g Ωμ^a τ^a/2 - i g′ Y Bμ/2
  - Field strengths:
      F^a_{μν} = ∂μΩ^a_ν - ∂νΩ^a_μ + g ε^{abc} Ω^b_μ Ω^c_ν
      G_{μν}   = ∂μBν - ∂νBμ
  - Lagrangian core (time-first YM on substrate):
      ℒ = -¼ F^a_{μν}F^{a μν} - ¼ G_{μν}G^{μν} + i ψ̄L γμ Dμ ψL + i ψ̄R γμ (∂μ - i g′ Y Bμ/2) ψR

section: resonance locking (mass generation)
  - Temporal twist (condensate) defines a nonzero, uniform time-phase rate:
      ⟨𝜽̇⟩ ≡ ωH   (phase-lock across substrate domains)
  - Effective mass terms for vector modes:
      mW = (g/2) ωH
      mZ = (√(g^2 + g′^2)/2) ωH
    ⇒ mW/mZ = cosθW with tanθW = g′/g.
  - Physical electroweak basis:
      W±_μ = (Ω^1_μ ∓ i Ω^2_μ)/√2
      Z_μ  = cosθW Ω^3_μ - sinθW B_μ
      A_μ  = sinθW Ω^3_μ + cosθW B_μ

section: currents and parity
  - Charged current:
      J^μ_W = ψ̄L γμ (τ^+ ψL) + h.c.      (τ^± = (τ^1 ± i τ^2)/2)
  - Neutral current:
      J^μ_Z = ψ̄ γμ (T^3_L - sin^2θW Q) ψ
  - Parity violation:
      Only ψL couples to Ωμ^a; this is the geometric statement that the weak force is the
      selective coupling of the substrate’s left-handed adherence sheet.

section: relation to mass/mixing (Pirouette)
  - Fermion masses m_f arise from the Pirouette mass law with (μ, p, q; PR, Pur) determined per
    species; mixing matrices are adherence-misalignment between kinetic (Ωμ,Bμ) and mass funnels:
      UPMNS = U†_L(e) U_L(ν) ,  UCKM = U†_L(u) U_L(d).
  - NEU-061 result integrates here: universal geometry (common p,q) + oscillation data ⇒ NO favored.
    The same (p,q) geometry informs lepton couplings to Ωμ via ψL doublets.

section: predictions (time-first specific)
  P1. θW as torsion–curvature ratio:
      tanθW = g′/g emerges from substrate parameters; running with scale μ arises from
      temporal RG on (g(μ), g′(μ)). Expect standard one-loop slopes with small geometric
      corrections ∝ d log ωH/d log μ (to be fit in FRC-004A).
  P2. W/Z mass relation:
      mW/mZ = cosθW holds identically at tree level. Deviations quantify substrate loop terms.
  P3. 0νββ reach correlation:
      In universal (p,q), |mββ| upper tail for NO peaks at ~20–25 meV; if experiments find
      |mββ| ≳ 50–80 meV without cosmology allowing Σ ≳ 0.2 eV, the geometry or universality breaks.
  P4. High-energy restoration:
      For s ≫ ωH^2, SU(2)L × U(1)Y symmetry is restored (ωH→0 effective), reproducing
      standard high-energy weak scattering; predicts smooth approach with slope tied to
      dωH/dμ (substrate thawing rate).

section: falsification & fits
  F1. Geometry universality test (leptons):
      Fit (p,q) on NEU-061 (oscillation+external). Use same (p,q) to predict mW, mZ via ωH
      extracted from lepton mass sector + θW(μ=mZ). If joint χ² (osc + EW) is large, either
      (i) geometry is not universal or (ii) weak-sector mapping of ωH is incomplete.
  F2. θW running:
      Compare predicted sin^2θW(μ) to precision data at μ = mZ, low-Q^2 Møller, APV.
      A common small offset δθW tied to ωH running would support time-first torsion.
  F3. W mass tension:
      Use mW = (g/2) ωH with g(μ) from standard RG; any persistent ΔmW beyond loop expectations
      demands either a correction in ωH(μ) or extra substrate degrees of freedom.
  F4. Parity observables:
      Left–right asymmetries in polarized e− scattering follow purely from ψL coupling; quantify
      predicted A_PV vs data. Deviations with characteristic energy scaling would indicate
      small right-sheet leakage or finite-temperature substrate effects.

section: interfaces & pipelines
  - Data hooks:
      • NEU-061 provides (p,q) and Σ,mβ,|mββ| ranges under universal geometry.
      • FRC-004A: fit θW(μ), extract (g,g′) and ωH at μ=mZ, close the W/Z system.
      • FRC-004D: compute UPMNS, UCKM from adherence-misalignment; compare to PDG fits.
  - Minimal numerical loop (sketch):
      1) Take (p,q) from NEU-061; infer lepton funnel scales (μℓ) and phase structure.
      2) Fit θW at μ=mZ → (g,g′); compute ωH := 2 mZ / √(g^2 + g′^2).
      3) Predict mW = (g/2) ωH ; compare to experiment; update ωH(μ) running if needed.
      4) Optional: propagate geometry to quark sector to test CKM angles from misalignment.

appendix A: derivation highlights
  A1. Covariant derivative from time-adherence:
      Require parallel transport of left-adherence density 𝒜L along worldlines to be frame-independent.
      Non-integrable rotations in the adherence frame bundle define Ωμ; torsional drift in global
      adherence defines Bμ. Minimal substitution yields Dμ above.
  A2. Mass from resonance locking:
      Linearize action around a uniform time-phase rotation ⟨θ̇⟩=ωH; quadratic terms in Ωμ produce
      Proca masses proportional to ωH with factors fixed by the algebra (1/2 for SU(2) generators
      in fundamental). Orthogonalization with Bμ yields Z and Aμ bases.

conclusion: |
  In Pirouette, the weak force is not “weak by accident” but by geometry: only the left-handed
  adherence sheet couples to curvature quanta (Ωμ), and its effective cross-section is the
  chiral fraction of the substrate. Electroweak symmetry breaking is resonance locking of
  time-phase at ωH, producing massive W/Z and leaving U(1)em. With neutrino ordering fixed by
  universal geometry (NEU-061), FRC-004 closes the minimal lepton–weak loop and positions us for
  a grand time-first reconstruction of the particle zoo.
