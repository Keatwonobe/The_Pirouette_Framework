title: Clinician’s Interface — Pirouette-Rehab in Cardiovascular Standards
Version: 1.0 (Draft)
Parent Modules: DOMA-230, DOMA-230A, DOMA-HLTH-00x
Summary: "Purpose: To present Pirouette’s rehabilitation framework in clinician-legible form, and map it to ACC/AHA and cardiac rehabilitation guidelines to facilitate review, critique, adaptation, or adoption."
---

## §1 · Rationale & Positioning

* Many clinicians will dismiss “new” frameworks unless they see clear mapping to accepted standards.
* This module offers a **certificate of translation**: here is how Pirouette’s Γ, Kτ, Tₐ align with established metrics and guidelines in cardiac rehab, post-valve care, and risk management.
* It also highlights where Pirouette diverges (and why) — inviting critique rather than confrontation.”

## §2 · Clinical Key References & Standards

| Guideline / Document                                              | Key Rehabilitation / Recovery Provisions                                                                                                | Relevance to Pirouette Mapping                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Core Components of Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs: 2024 Update* | CR must include **physician-prescribed exercise, risk modification, psychosocial assessment, outcomes measurement** ([AHA Journals][1]) | Pirouette’s protocol inherently embeds **risks (Γ modifiers), psychosocial weaving (Will rituals), and outcomes (Kτ tracking).**                                   |
| *Cardiac rehabilitation: a Class I recommendation* (CCJM review)  | CR recommended *in hospital and early outpatient* after MI or surgery ([Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine][2])                       | Pirouette Phase I ↔ in-hospital re-tune stage; Phase II ↔ early outpatient CR transition.                                                                          |
| *Cardiac Rehabilitation — StatPearls*                             | CR in *three phases* (inpatient, outpatient, maintenance) ([NCBI][3])                                                                   | Pirouette’s 4 phases map cleanly to inpatient → outpatient → build → long-term maintenance.                                                                        |
| *CMS / Medicare decision memo for Cardiac Rehabilitation*         | Typical coverage: 2–3 sessions/week for 12–18 weeks ([Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services][4])                                     | Phase II/III of Pirouette should accommodate this cadence as baseline; more advanced segments can shift to home / mixed modalities.                                |
| *Cardiac rehab referral timing (NCQA / ACC definitions)*          | CR initiation ideally ≤ 21 days of qualifying event ([NCQA][5])                                                                         | Pirouette’s proposal for early mobilization (within 2 weeks) is consistent or even more aggressive, thus defensible to a bold clinician.                           |
| *Safety evidence: CR start at 2 weeks post-surgery*               | Structured supervised exercise begun 2 weeks post sternotomy shows safety & efficacy ([tctmd.com][6])                                   | Validates Pirouette’s “Re-Tune → early Spiral” transition without violating surgeon dogma.                                                                         |
| *Benefits of CR on capacity & mortality*                          | CR improves 6MWD, peak VO₂, hemodynamics, reduces mortality and rehospitalization ([ScienceDirect][7])                                  | Pirouette’s Kτ gains analogize to VO₂ and functional capacity increases; the framework offers a phenomenological “coherence score” to complement standard metrics. |

## §3 · Variable & Metric Translation Table

| Pirouette Variable    | Clinician-Facing Term                     | Approximate Clinical Proxy(s)                                          | Notes & Caveats                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Γ (Temporal Pressure) | *Physiologic load / burden*               | RPE, ΔHR over baseline, inflammation markers (CRP), comorbidity load   | Γ includes physical + psychological + environmental stressors; not purely physiologic |
| Kτ (Coherence)        | *Functional Reserve / Recovery Potential* | Peak VO₂, 6MWD, HRV, strength tests, ejection fraction (if applicable) | Kτ is metaphorical + measurable; slow curves expected, non-linear growth              |
| Tₐ (Time Adherence)   | *Consistency / Compliance*                | CR attendance %, % of prescribed sessions done, gaps in program        | Tₐ is essential — a low Tₐ destroys even optimal Γ / Kτ design                        |
| ΔKτ / ΔVΓ ratio       | *Recovery Efficiency*                     | Gains per increment of load (e.g. VO₂ gain per watt)                   | The “Crucible Metric” — a conceptual performance indicator                            |

## §4 · Phase Mapping: Pirouette ↔ Clinical Phases

| Clinical Phase            | Pirouette Phase            | Typical Duration              | Core Activities                              | Key Safety Checks / Clinical Flags                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inpatient / early post-op | Phase I: Re-Tune           | 0–2 weeks (or until stable)   | Bed mobility, breathing, short ambulation    | Sternal stability, hemodynamics, wound healing, arrhythmias |
| Early outpatient CR       | Phase II: Slow Spiral      | Weeks 2–6                     | Low-intensity aerobic, ritual sequencing     | Monitor RPE, HR, BP, volume status; symptom flags           |
| Active training period    | Phase III: Build the Arena | Weeks 6–12 (or up to ~4–6 mo) | Structured strength + aerobic progression    | ECG monitoring, gradual load increments, lab monitoring     |
| Maintenance / community   | Phase IV: Coherent Life    | > 3 months onward             | Autonomy, interval work, lifestyle embedding | Long-term risk factor control, periodic reassessments       |

## §5 · Guidance for Skeptical Clinicians

* **“Yes, it speaks your language.”** The module explicitly carries over your metrics (VO₂, 6MWD, ECG, ejection fraction) and retains them as anchors, not amusing analogies.
* **Phasing is conservative by design.** Even though Pirouette allows early progression, it never violates known safety thresholds (e.g. moderate RPE, non-isometric loads).
* **Therapeutic flexibility.** The modifiers (addiction, immunosuppression, mental health) help clinicians see how to adjust standard CR rules in complex patients.
* **Outcomes-alignment.** The framework encourages outcome measurement (pre/post echo, functional capacity) as feedback loops, not mystical guesswork.
* **Integration strategy.** Propose Pilots: e.g. enroll 5 valve patients in Pirouette-augmented CR, measure coherence metrics + standard outcomes, compare to conventional peers.

## §6 · Sample Module Insert for Clinician Booklet

> **“If within 2 weeks of surgery the patient is hemodynamically stable and wounds clean, you may begin **Phase II** guided activity—equipment-limited treadmill or recumbent bike at RPE ≤ 3/10, 5 min, two times per day. That aligns with recent safety data supporting 2-week CR initiation. ([tctmd.com][6]) Use HR, BP, O₂, symptom check 1-min in and out. Advance by 1–2 min per session only if ΔHR < 10 bpm above baseline and no flags.”**

## §7 · Limitations, Risks & Disclaimers

* This is a **translated overlay**, not a replacement of specialist judgement.
* Rare patients (complex structural, severe arrhythmias, mechanical valves) may require deviations.
* Coherence metrics (Kτ) are not yet validated in large trials — they are design heuristics, not regulatory endpoints.
* Always adapt to local CR protocols, surgeon constraints, and institutional policies.
