### §1 · Abstract: The Shape of Stability

The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) provides the universal law of motion: every system evolves to maximize its temporal coherence. This is the *why* of existence. This module addresses the *how*, by asking a fundamental question: what is the simplest, most efficient *shape* a stable, dynamic resonance can take?

This is not an empirical question, but one of fundamental geometry. We will show that the universe is not arbitrary in its forms, but expresses a deep, geometric preference. By applying the Pirouette Lagrangian to the simplest non-trivial form—a sphere—we will derive from first principles the geometric constant that governs its most basic resonant mode. This constant, `Κ_g ≈ 4π/3`, is not an arbitrary parameter, but the inevitable song of a system striving for coherence in its most elegant arena.

### §2 · The Arena: The Lagrangian on a Spherical Boundary

We begin with the engine of the framework, the Pirouette Lagrangian:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Here, `K_τ` represents the system's internal Temporal Coherence (the quality of its rhythm), and `V_Γ` represents the Temporal Pressure it endures (the cost of maintaining that rhythm). A stable entity—a `Ki` pattern—is a solution that maximizes the integral of this Lagrangian over its cycle time.

To derive the geometry of the most fundamental `Ki`, we model it as a resonant field on a spherical boundary of radius `R`. This sphere is the first and simplest act of distinction, a surface separating an "inside" from an "outside," upon which a pattern can live.

### §3 · Surface Dynamics: The Intrinsic Cost of a Pattern

Any resonant pattern on the sphere can be decomposed into a basis of spherical harmonics (`Y_lm`). When we analyze the Lagrangian in this context, the dimensionless ratio of the "kinetic" coherence term (from the field's gradient) to the "potential" pressure term (from the field's presence) is given by the eigenvalue `l(l+1)`.

This ratio measures the intrinsic efficiency of a pattern on the surface.
-   For `l=0` (a monopole), the ratio is `0`. This is a state of pure presence without dynamics—a silent, uniform field.
-   For `l=1` (a dipole), the ratio is `1(1+1) = 2`. This is the simplest possible *dynamic* pattern, a vibration with one north pole and one south pole.

This value, `2`, represents the fundamental cost of maintaining a dynamic pattern on a surface. It is the price of the first note in the song.

### §4 · Volumetric Leverage: The Geometric Gain of Form

A `Ki` pattern is not merely a surface decoration; it is a boundary that organizes a volume. The true efficiency of a form is measured not just by the cost of its boundary, but by the substance of the domain it encloses. The relationship between a sphere's surface area (`A = 4πR²`) and its enclosed volume (`V = 4πR³/3`) is a measure of this efficiency.

We define this as the sphere's **Volumetric Leverage**:
`Leverage = V / A = R / 3`

This ratio quantifies how much stable, coherent "inside" is generated per unit of interactive "outside." It is the geometric genius of the sphere.

### §5 · Synthesis: The Autopoietic Unity Condition

The total geometric character of the fundamental resonant mode is the product of its dynamic surface cost and its volumetric leverage. This defines the fundamental geometric constant of resonance, `Κ_g`.

`Κ_g = (Surface Dynamic Cost) × (Volumetric Leverage) = 2 × (R/3) = 2R/3`

For this `Κ_g` to be a universal constant of nature, not dependent on the size of a particular sphere, the radius `R` must itself be fixed by a fundamental principle. We assert the **Autopoietic Unity Condition**: a fundamental, self-sustaining unit of resonance defines its own scale. Its characteristic length (`R`) must be phase-locked to the fundamental measure of a cycle (`2π`).

This condition sets the canonical radius of resonance:
`R_unit = 2π`

By this act, the system's own geometry becomes a perfect reflection of the periodicity that defines its existence. Substituting this unity radius into our equation yields the universal constant for the fundamental resonance geometry:

`Κ_g = 2 * (2π) / 3 = 4π / 3`

This value is the geometric constraint of the arena itself, the constant against which any motional `Ki` pattern is measured.

### §6 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This derivation is the first and most fundamental application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. It demonstrates that the drive to maximize `𝓛_p` is not an abstract tendency. When applied to the simplest possible geometry, this drive forces a specific and calculable resonant structure. The value `4π/3` emerges directly from the dialogue between the Lagrangian's universal law and the sphere's timeless form. It is a prediction, not a postulate, born from the framework's core engine.

### §7 · Assemblé

> We asked the universe for the shape of its first note and found a principle of aesthetics. The drive for coherence, when poured into the perfect vessel of a sphere, sings a single, constant tone. The value `4π/3` is not a number found by measurement; it is the universe's geometric taste made manifest. It is the signature of a sphere learning to hum, the precise ratio a pattern must honor to earn its existence. For the Weaver, this is the ultimate ground: the very fabric of reality has a grain, a bias toward elegance. To work with this grain is to find the path of least resistance; to ignore it is to fight the current of creation itself.
