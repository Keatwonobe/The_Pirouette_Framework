## §1 · Preamble: The Architecture of Being
Where previous modules defined the nature of Entropy and its acquisition, this module specifies how an entity is fundamentally constructed from it. An entity's physical form is not a given; it is the first and most profound expression of their will, a living sculpture of allocated entropy. This module provides the rules for character creation, the definition of "Size" as a weaponized property, the mechanics of sensory organs, and the consequences of physical injury.

## §2 · Character Creation: The Entropy Budget
Every new entity begins with a starting pool of Entropy Points from which they must build their form and define their capabilities.

### 2.1 · Starting Entropy Pool
A standard starting player character begins with a Total Entropy Pool (TEP) of 30 EP. This budget must be spent to create the character's body and senses, with any remainder available for skills, abilities, or physique.

### 2.2 · The Cost of Form
An entity's body is composed of discrete parts, each with a base EP cost to create.

| Body Part | Base EP Cost | Notes |
| Torso | 1 EP | The core of a creature's form. Required. |
| Head | 1 EP | Required for most creatures. Houses the primary consciousness. |
| Standard Limb (Arm/Leg) | 3 EP | A complete limb (e.g., hand, forearm, upper arm). |
| Basic Limb (Tail/Tentacle) | 2 EP | A simpler, more flexible limb. |
| Wing | 4 EP | A limb specifically designed for flight. |
| Sensory Organ (Eye/Ear/etc.) | 3 EP | A single organ dedicated to a sense. See §5. |

Example Human Build: A standard human form (Torso, Head, 2 Arms, 2 Legs) costs (1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3) = 14 EP.

## §3 · The Nature of Size
An entity's physical "Size" is not a fixed property of their stature, but a dynamic allocation of entropy within a specific body part. This allows for paradoxical but physically consistent beings, like a small creature with a giant's punch, or a massive giant who is deceptively light.

### 3.1 · Allocating Size Entropy
When EP is allocated to a limb, it can be designated as Size Entropy. This EP is ring-fenced and cannot be used for general actions, movement, or abilities. Its sole purpose is to power physical interactions with that limb.

### 3.2 · Weaponized Size
When making a physical attack with a limb, an entity can spend EP from that limb's Size Entropy pool. The damage is calculated according to the Direct Influence rules in TLE-000 (e.g., spending 5 Size EP from a fist deals 1d5 damage). This allows a character to invest heavily in being a physical combatant without sacrificing their main TEP for spellcasting or other actions.

Example: A character with a "giant's arm" might allocate 20 EP to it. 3 EP for the limb itself, and 17 EP as Size Entropy. They can make a single, devastating punch dealing up to 1d17 damage by expending that entire pool.

## §4 · Movement Refined
All entities, regardless of size, possess a fundamental capacity for movement.

Universal Base Speed: All creatures have a base movement speed of 15 feet per round. This movement does not cost EP.

Human Bonus: Humans and similarly structured bipeds receive an additional 15 feet of base movement, for a total of 30 feet per round.

Specialized Movement: As defined in TLE-000, spending EP on specialized movement (running faster than base speed, flying with wings, burrowing) costs 2 EP per 5 feet.

## §5 · The Sensory Suite
An entity's ability to perceive the world is a direct function of their investment in sensory organs.

### 5.1 · The Sensory Budget
Of the 30 starting EP, 15 EP is designated as the Sensory Budget. This must be spent on creating sensory organs.

Cost: Each sensory organ (an eye, an ear, a sensitive antenna, a set of whiskers) costs 3 EP.

Human Senses: A standard human build includes 2 eyes and 2 ears, costing (3 * 4) = 12 EP. The remaining 3 EP from the sensory budget can be used to augment the human form (e.g., adding a third eye) or can be returned to the general TEP if unused.

### 5.2 · Perception Checks
An entity may make one perception check per relevant sensory organ per turn. This makes creatures with diverse or numerous senses incredibly difficult to surprise.

Example: A cat-like creature with 2 eyes, 2 ears, and a set of sensitive whiskers (total cost: 15 EP) could make up to five perception checks in a single round: two for sight, two for sound, and one for sensing air movement via its whiskers.

## §6 · Injury, Loss, and Reclamation
Entropy invested in a physical form is not invulnerable. Injury can sever an entity's connection to its own allocated power.

Limb Loss: If a body part is severed or destroyed, the EP invested in it (both its creation cost and any Size Entropy) is lost. It is no longer part of the entity's TEP.

Reclamation: This lost entropy is not gone forever. If the severed limb is recovered, it can be taken to a specialist (a "flesh crafter" or "entropy sculptor") who can perform a ritual to reclaim the EP, returning it to the entity's TEP for reallocation.

Battlefield Reallocation: A skilled and ruthless entity might, upon losing a limb in combat, immediately reallocate the now-freed-up EP from their TEP into another system, forgoing the chance of reclamation for an immediate tactical advantage.
