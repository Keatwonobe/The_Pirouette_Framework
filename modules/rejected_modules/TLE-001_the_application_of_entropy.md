## §1 · Preamble: From Pool to Power
Where TLE-000 defined the nature of Entropy Points (EP) as an internal resource, this module details how Entropy is acquired from the external world and manipulated through advanced skills and strategies. It provides the mechanics for an entity to not only wield their own will, but to harvest the resonant echoes of defeated foes, completed quests, and the very fabric of the world itself.

## §2 · Acquiring Entropy
An entity's Total Entropy Pool (TEP) is not a static limit. Through skill and adventure, it can be expanded. Entropy is found in the world in two primary forms: crystallized and liquid.

### 2.1 · Crystallized Entropy (Loot & Rewards)
The most common way to acquire new entropy is by collecting its crystallized form. When a coherent entity is defeated or a complex task is resolved, the resonant energy of that event can coalesce into a physical, tangible object.

Combat: Defeated enemies have a chance to drop Entropy Shards, small, crystalline motes of raw potential. The more powerful the foe, the larger and more potent the shard.

Quests & Discovery: Completing a significant quest or discovering a location of great power may yield Entropy Crystals or unique Resonant Geodes as a reward. These are stable, high-value sources of EP.

Adventuring: Exploring the world and interacting with its systems can uncover latent pockets of crystallized entropy, often in the form of ancient artifacts or naturally occurring resonant minerals.

These items are inert on their own but hold vast potential for a skilled practitioner.

### 2.2 · Liquid Entropy (Environmental Infusion)
In certain rare locations, the barrier between the physical world and the underlying flow of resonance is thin. Within the great roaming cities, built upon ancient arcane paths, this "arcane lifeblood" can be accessed.

Infusion: In taverns, universities, or private workshops connected to a city's heart, this raw, liquid entropy can be directly channeled into an entity. This process is draining for the channeler and often costly for the recipient.

Transmutation: An entity with the appropriate skill can learn to transmute their own EP into a liquid, transferable form, allowing them to directly empower allies.

## §3 · Transmutation & Crafting
Raw entropy, whether crystallized or liquid, must be processed. This is the domain of transmutation and enchanting—the art of turning potential into power.

### 3.1 · The Skill of Transmutation
An entity can learn the Transmutation skill, which allows them to absorb crystallized entropy or be infused with liquid entropy, adding the EP to their own Total Entropy Pool. This is a delicate process, limited by an entity's own capacity.

Rate Limit: An entity can only transmute a total number of EP per day equal to their Entropy Regeneration Rate (ERR).

Pool Limit: An entity's TEP cannot exceed its natural maximum through transmutation alone. To permanently increase one's TEP requires leveling up or other, rarer means.

### 3.2 · Enchantment: The Permanent Investment
Entropy can be permanently invested into an item to imbue it with magical properties. This is the art of enchanting.

Process: The enchanter invests a portion of their own TEP into an object. This EP is permanently lost from the enchanter's personal pool, reducing their maximum TEP.

Item Power: The enchanted item gains its own, separate TEP and often its own ERR, allowing it to be used without drawing on the wielder's personal entropy. A powerful wand might have a TEP of 20 and an ERR of 10, making it a formidable tool.

### 3.3 · Disenchantment: Reclaiming the Spark
An enchanted item can be destroyed to reclaim the entropy locked within. This is a volatile and final process.

Process: Through a focused ritual, an enchanter can shatter the resonant structure of a magic item. The item is destroyed, and the EP that was invested in its creation is returned to the enchanter's TEP, restoring their previous maximum.

## §4 · Strategic Applications & Combat Styles
The mutability of entropy allows for vastly different strategic approaches to combat and problem-solving. An entity's allocation of EP defines their very nature as a wielder of will.

### 4.1 · The Artificer (The Wand User)
This practitioner externalizes their power, investing their personal TEP into a collection of powerful enchanted items.

Strategy: The Artificer's own TEP may be quite low, but they wield multiple wands, staves, and artifacts, each with its own deep entropy pool and rapid regeneration. This allows for a massive output of power in a short time.

Vulnerability: Their strength is not their own. Disarming an Artificer can render them nearly powerless, as their personal reserves are minimal.

### 4.2 · The Guardian (The Ward Witch)
This practitioner turns defense into offense, using their entropy to absorb and redirect the will of their foes.

Strategy: The Guardian allocates most of their EP to defensive skills and their Physique. They spend their turns creating powerful shields, absorbing incoming damage. This absorbed energy is temporarily stored in a Residual Entropy Budget. At the end of a round, or when an opportunity presents itself, they can unleash this entire budget as a single, devastating offensive attack.

Vulnerability: This style is reactive. A Guardian must be able to withstand the initial blow to turn it back on their enemy. They can be overwhelmed by multiple, simultaneous threats.

### 4.3 · The Trickster (Entropy Misdirection)
The most advanced and esoteric art involves not just wielding one's own entropy, but manipulating the entropy of others.

Strategy: A Trickster uses subtle skills to interfere with an opponent's entropy allocation. They might force an opponent's EP from their limbs into their physique, weakening their attacks, or even attempt to siphon EP directly. This is the art of putting an opponent's entropy "somewhere it doesn't belong."

Vulnerability: This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that requires immense skill and focus. A failed attempt can leave the Trickster open to a devastating counter-attack.
