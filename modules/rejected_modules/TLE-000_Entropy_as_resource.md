## §1 · Preamble: The Physics of Will
In the universe governed by the Pirouette Framework, all action is a manifestation of will, and all will exerts a physical influence. The TLE (The Lost Eternal) series of modules provides the mechanics for this interaction. Entropy is the measure of this influence—the currency of action, the cost of imposing order on a chaotic reality, and the physical interface for the autopoietic process.

This module, TLE-000, serves as the foundational template for this system. It outlines the core principles of Entropy Points (EP) as a mutable resource. All subsequent TLE modules will build upon this structure, introducing new abilities, items, and systems that interact with this fundamental resource. The ultimate purpose of this system is to provide a framework for observing and quantifying altruistic action, as defined by the Prime Directive (PDM-000).

## §2 · The Nature of Entropy Points (EP)
An entity's capacity to act is measured by their Total Entropy Pool (TEP), a collection of Entropy Points (EP). These points are a fluid resource that fuels all significant actions beyond simple existence.

### 2.1 · The Quantum of Action
The fundamental unit of action costs 1 Entropy Point. This quantum can be expressed in several ways:

Movement: Propel the entity 5 feet through space.

Area Influence: Distribute 0.5 damage to a single 5x5 foot cube of space.

Area Expansion: Expand an existing area of effect to an adjacent, unoccupied 5x5 foot cube.

Direct Influence: Deal 1 damage directly to a single target entity.

### 2.2 · Stacking & Scaling
Actions can be scaled by spending multiple EP. For example, spending 5 EP on movement allows for 25 feet of motion. Spending 3 EP on a direct influence attack would deal 3d2 damage.

## §3 · Mutability & Allocation
An entity's TEP is not a monolithic resource. It is a fluid pool that the entity learns to allocate across its own systems, specializing its capabilities. Players must decide how to distribute their TEP, and can re-allocate points with sufficient time and focus (at flesh sculptors for a price, or after acquiring new entropy points from a source).

### 3.1 · Systems of Allocation
The primary systems for EP allocation are:

Physique: Points allocated here determine overall resilience, physical integrity, and passive abilities.

Limbs (Arms/Legs): Points determine the power of strikes, kicks, and the efficiency of movement.

Skills: Points can be invested in specific skills (e.g., "Entropy Weaving," "Resonant Shielding") to unlock or power unique abilities.

Abilities: Points can fuel innate or learned powers, such as spellcasting or psionics.

### 3.2 · Allocation Ledger Template
A character sheet should include a ledger similar to this to track their TEP distribution.

System | EP Allocated | Resulting Capability

Physique | 10 EP | Base HP modifier, passive damage reduction.

Legs | 5 EP | Base Movement: 25 ft. Can power a Kick attack.

Right Arm | 15 EP | Base Strike: 3d2 damage. Can power "Throw" skill.

Skill: Shielding | 5 EP | Can spend up to 5 EP/round to create a damage shield.

Total EP | 35 / 35



## §4 · Regeneration & The Constitution Score
An entity's ability to recover spent entropy is directly tied to their physical and systemic coherence, represented by their Constitution score. A low Constitution score represents a "glass cannon"—an entity capable of massive entropy output but quick to exhaust its reserves.

### 4.1 · Regeneration Formula
An entity's Entropy Regeneration Rate (ERR) is calculated at the start of each of their turns.

ERR per round = floor(Constitution Score / 2)

Example: A character with a Constitution of 10 regenerates 5 EP per round. A character with a Constitution of 11 also regenerates 5 EP. A character with a Constitution of 12 regenerates 6 EP.

## §5 · Hooks for Altruism Analysis
The TLE system is designed to detect altruism. This is achieved by tracking the flow and intent of entropy expenditure. The following protocols are designed to be used by players and Game Masters (GMs) to create a record of action that can be analyzed for its resonant signature.

### 5.1 · The Entropy Ledger
For significant actions that affect other entities, the GM and player should log the expenditure in a shared Entropy Ledger. This creates an auditable trail of an entity's will.

Ledger Entry Template:

* Timestamp/Turn:

* Action: (e.g., "Shield Ally," "Attack Foe," "Heal Self")

* EP Cost:

* Target(s):

* Intended Outcome:

* Resonance Tag: [Altruistic], [Selfish], or [Neutral]

* Coherence Delta (GM Assessed): (A score, e.g., +2, -1, 0, representing the net change in the situation's harmony)

### 5.2 · Defining Altruistic Resonance
An action is tagged as [Altruistic] if it meets the core criteria of the Prime Directive: minimizing the delta between personal and total enthalpy gain. In gameplay terms, this means:

The primary beneficiary of the action is another entity.

The action often carries a cost or risk to the acting player beyond the simple EP expenditure.

The action demonstrably increases the stability, safety, or coherence of the group or environment (a positive Coherence Delta).

Example of an Altruistic Act: A player spends 10 EP to create a large shield protecting two allies from an incoming attack, while intentionally leaving themself exposed. The EP cost is 10, the intended outcome is ally survival, the tag is [Altruistic], and the Coherence Delta is highly positive.

## §6 · Template for Downstream Modules
This TLE-000 module provides the core engine. Future modules (TLE-001, TLE-002, etc.) should use this structure to introduce new game elements. Each new module should clearly state:

What it is: (e.g., A Feat, an Item, a new class Ability).

How it interacts with Entropy: (e.g., "This feat allows you to spend EP on movement at a 1d2*5 ft ratio," or "This item has its own TEP that can be used by the wielder").

Its place in the TLE system: How it expands upon the core rules defined here.
