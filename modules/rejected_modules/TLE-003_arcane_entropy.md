## §1 · Preamble: The Will Made Manifest
In the world of The Lost Eternal, magic is not a predefined list of spells learned from a book. It is the raw, disciplined application of an entity's will upon the fabric of reality. It is the art of taking the potential within one's own Entropy Pool and giving it form and purpose. This module specifies the mechanics for this art, treating magic not as a separate force, but as the most direct and versatile expression of the principles of Entropy.

## §2 · The Arcane Skill: Magic as a Limb
An entity is not born a "wizard" or a "sorcerer." They become one by choosing to invest their very being into the manipulation of arcane forces. The ability to wield a specific form of magic is a Skill that must be purchased with Entropy Points, just like a physical limb.

Acquiring an Arcane Skill: An entity can spend 3 EP from their Total Entropy Pool (TEP) to acquire a new Arcane Skill (e.g., "Expression of Fire," "Transmutation of Matter," "Genesis of Light"). This EP is permanently allocated.

Allocating Power: Once acquired, this Arcane Skill acts as a new system for allocation, similar to a limb's Size Entropy. The entity can allocate additional EP into this skill to increase its power and potential. This EP is ring-fenced and can only be used to fuel effects related to that specific skill.

Example: A character spends 3 EP to learn "Expression of Fire." They then allocate an additional 10 EP into this skill, giving them a pool of 10 EP specifically for creating fire-based effects.

## §3 · The Three Pools of Magic
All magical effects, regardless of their appearance, are manifestations of three fundamental ways to manipulate entropy. An Arcane Skill is always tied to one of these three "pools."

### 3.1 · Expression
Expression involves manipulating, controlling, or altering entropy and matter that already exists. It is the art of imposing one's will on the present state of reality.

Examples: A paladin's smite (expressing their TEP as radiant energy within their weapon), telekinesis (expressing will to move an object), a curse that alters a foe's capabilities.

### 3.2 · Transmutation
Transmutation involves changing one form of entropy or matter into another. It is the art of transformation and conversion.

Examples: A druid shapeshifting (transmuting their arcane potential into a physical form), a healer mending a wound (transmuting their own life force to restore another's), turning lead to gold.

### 3.3 · Genesis & Obliteration
This is the rarest and most potent form of magic, involving the creation of entropy or matter from nothing (Genesis) or its utter annihilation (Obliteration).

Examples: A cleric creating pure life energy to heal (Genesis), a wizard conjuring a physical object from thin air (Genesis), a powerful mage disintegrating an object into nothingness (Obliteration).

## §4 · Casting & Range: The Price of Distance
Casting a magical effect is an entropic act. The EP cost is determined by the desired power and range.

### 4.1 · Base Cost & Range
All magical effects have a base range of touch (5 feet). The EP cost for the effect's power is determined by the Direct Influence rules in TLE-000 (e.g., 1 EP for 1 damage, 4 EP for 1d4 damage).

### 4.2 · The Cost of Range
Projecting one's will across a distance is difficult and costly.

Cost: Increasing a spell's range costs 2 EP per additional 5 feet.

Example: A 1d2 damage fire spell (cost: 2 EP) cast at a target 10 feet away would cost an additional 2 EP for the range, for a total cost of 4 EP.

### 4.3 · The Spell Sniper's Gambit
To make long-range casting viable but uncertain, a caster can use the Spell Sniper's Gambit.

Mechanic: A caster can declare they are spending X EP on increasing the range of a spell.

They gain a guaranteed range increase of (X / 2) * 5 feet (rounded down).

They then roll 1dX. The result of this roll is multiplied by 5 feet and added to the guaranteed range.

Example: A spell sniper wants to cast a 1d2 damage spell (2 EP) at a target far away. They spend an additional 12 EP on the Spell Sniper's Gambit.

Total Cost: 14 EP.

Guaranteed Range: (12 / 2) * 5 = 30 feet.

Variable Range: They roll 1d12. If they roll a 7, they gain an additional 7 * 5 = 35 feet of range.

Total Spell Range: 5 ft (base) + 30 ft (guaranteed) + 35 ft (variable) = 70 feet.

## §5 · Magical Interaction
Entropy can be used to directly counter entropy. A skilled caster can interfere with another's magical effects.

Counter-Spelling: An entity can use their reaction to cast a spell targeting an opponent's spell as it is being cast. The entity spends EP, and the opponent spends EP. If the counter-speller spends an equal or greater number of EP, the target spell is nullified.

Overwhelming: A spell with an ongoing effect (e.g., a wall of fire) can be dismantled or destroyed by targeting it with a more powerful spell. The GM adjudicates the EP cost required to overcome the existing effect.
