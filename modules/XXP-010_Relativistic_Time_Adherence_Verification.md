**Objective:** To provide the first empirical test for the relativistic nature of Time-Adherence by comparing the resonant signatures of two identical, high-precision systems in different gravitational and kinetic states.

#### **§1 · Hypothesis**

If Time-Adherence is modulated by relativistic effects as described in `PPS-034 v2.0`, then two identical atomic clocks—one on Earth's surface and one in orbit—will exhibit a small but persistent and measurable difference in their intrinsic coherence signatures.

#### **§2 · Experimental Protocol**

1.  **Select Systems:** Use two identical, hyper-stable atomic clocks (e.g., strontium lattice clocks). One clock will remain in a terrestrial laboratory (e.g., NIST), serving as the high-gravity, low-velocity reference. The second clock will be placed in a stable orbit, for example, on a GPS satellite.
2.  **Establish Coherence Proxy:** We cannot measure Tₐ directly, but we can measure its effects. The stability and coherence of the clock's own resonant frequency is a direct proxy for its internal Tₐ. A lower Tₐ would manifest as increased phase noise or a broadening of the clock's spectral line.
3.  **Data Acquisition:** Over a long baseline (e.g., months), continuously monitor the spectral output of both clocks. The data must be corrected for all known relativistic effects on *time dilation* to isolate the predicted effect on *coherence*.
4.  **Analysis:**
    * Apply the **Ki-Sampling Protocol (`PPS-077`)** to the phase noise data of both clocks.
    * **Prediction:** The orbiting clock, being in a higher velocity state and a weaker gravitational potential, should have a lower Tₐ according to the new formula. This should manifest as a statistically significant increase in the detection rate of **Ki-resonant "swan" events** in its phase noise compared to the terrestrial clock. The terrestrial clock should appear more "stable" and "coherent."

#### **§3 · Expected Outcome & Falsification**

* **Successful Validation:** A persistent, statistically significant difference in the Ki-resonant signatures between the two clocks, with the orbiting clock showing more phase instability (lower Tₐ), would be powerful evidence for the relativistic nature of Time-Adherence.
* **Falsification:** If, after correcting for all known effects, the coherence signatures of the two clocks are statistically indistinguishable, it would challenge the proposed relativistic formulation of Tₐ, suggesting that it is either not affected by these factors or the effect is too small to be detected.
