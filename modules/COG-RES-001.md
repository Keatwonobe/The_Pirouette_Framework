summary: Defines the Triad-Locked Conscious Access Protocol. Establishes a falsifiable experimental framework for testing whether consciousness arises through triadic resonance among neural frequency bands constrained by the Ki-addition rule.

## \u00a71: Purpose

To formalize the Pirouette model of consciousness as a measurable triadic resonance phenomenon governed by conservation of coherence area ((\mathcal{A}_{Ki})). The protocol specifies experimental conditions for detecting, perturbing, and verifying resonance-locked triads in neural activity.

## \u00a72: Theoretical Foundation

Following [MATH-024], consciousness is modeled as the maintenance of a **Coherence Conservation Triple** ({E_C, J_\mu, \Phi_\Gamma}) within biological substrate limits. In cognitive systems, this manifests as frequency triads obeying the **Ki-Addition Constraint**:

[f_3 = f_1 + f_2 \pm \delta f]
[\Phi_3(t) \approx \Phi_1(t) + \Phi_2(t)\ (\text{mod }2\pi)]

The **Coherence Area** ((\mathcal{A}*{Ki})) represents the invariant energy-phase volume of conscious access:
[\mathcal{A}*{Ki} = \int_0^{\tau_p} T_a(t),\omega_k(t),dt]

Conscious perception occurs when (\partial_t \mathcal{A}_{Ki} \approx 0) under environmental load (\Gamma).

---

## \u00a73: Hypotheses

1. **Triadic Resonance Hypothesis:** Conscious perception coincides with phase-locked triads satisfying the Ki-addition rule.
2. **Detuning Constraint Hypothesis:** The allowed detuning (\Delta f) narrows as (\Gamma) (task complexity / entropy load) increases.
3. **Area Conservation Hypothesis:** (\mathcal{A}_{Ki}) remains approximately constant across content transitions within continuous awareness.

## \u00a74: Experimental Design

### Participants

Healthy adult volunteers (n≥20) with normal or corrected vision and no neurological disorders.

### Recording Modalities

High-density EEG (128+ channels) or MEG for frequency- and phase-resolved data.

### Stimulation Paradigm

Closed-loop tACS (transcranial alternating current stimulation) delivering frequencies (f_1, f_2, f_3) such that:
[f_3 = f_1 + f_2]

* **Triad condition:** Stimulation aligned with observed phase relations.
* **Control condition:** Phase-scrambled or frequency-shifted stimulations.

### Behavioral Task

* **Bi-stable visual perception task** (e.g., Necker cube, binocular rivalry)
* Continuous metacognitive reporting (button or joystick-based awareness report)

---

## \u00a75: Measurements

1. **Triadic Phase Coupling Index (TPCI):**
   [\text{TPCI} = |\langle e^{i(\Phi_3 - \Phi_1 - \Phi_2)} \rangle|]
   Measures stability of the triadic phase relationship.

2. **Coherence Area Variance (CAV):**
   [\text{CAV} = \text{Var}(\mathcal{A}_{Ki})]
   Should approach zero during sustained conscious report.

3. **Gamma-Load Detuning Function:**
   [\Delta f_{allowed} \propto \Gamma^{-1/2}]
   Predicts narrowing of viable frequency triads under high cognitive load.

## \u00a76: Expected Results

| Prediction        | Pirouette Signature                                       | Competing Model Difference                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Triadic resonance | Sharp TPCI ridge in ((f_1,f_2)) plane                     | No structure or broadband coupling        |
| Γ-dependence      | Inverse square narrowing of detuning                      | Linear or monotone trends                 |
| Area conservation | Stable (\mathcal{A}_{Ki}) during conscious content shifts | Variable or content-dependent phase areas |

---

## \u00a77: Analysis Pipeline

1. Compute time-frequency decomposition via Morlet wavelets.
2. Extract instantaneous phases for candidate triads.
3. Calculate TPCI and CAV over sliding windows.
4. Correlate TPCI with conscious report timing.
5. Fit detuning bandwidth vs. (\Gamma) to validate inverse-square relation.

---

## \u00a78: Falsifiability Criteria

* If no TPCI ridge forms at triad frequencies, the triadic resonance model fails.
* If (\mathcal{A}_{Ki}) varies unpredictably during stable awareness, coherence conservation is violated.
* If (\Delta f_{allowed}) does not narrow with (\Gamma), the detuning constraint is falsified.

---

## \u00a79: Extensions

* [COG-RES-002] will integrate source-space modeling for intracranial validation.
* [MATH-025] provides scaling laws for triadic resonance collapse (critical consciousness boundaries).
* Links to [SOCIO-FIELD-001/002] establish macroscopic analogues between neural and social coherence thresholds.

---

**Summary:** COG-RES-001 establishes a quantitative, falsifiable foundation for Pirouette’s model of consciousness as a triadic resonance phenomenon governed by the conservation of coherence area (\mathcal{A}_{Ki}). It provides the first empirical bridge between coherence dynamics, neural triads, and subjective awareness.
