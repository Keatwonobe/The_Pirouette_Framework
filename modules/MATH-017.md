# The Foundry: how a mathematical formalism is chosen

A good formalism earns its keep by:

1. **Expressive fit** (natural primitives/invariants for your phenomena)
2. **Compositionality** (small → large by clean gluing rules)
3. **Calculi** (differentials/integrals or analogues to actually compute)
4. **Universal properties** (an initial/final object story—no ad-hoc glue)
5. **Bridge functors** to existing math (so you can import theorems)
6. **Computational semantics** (it runs on a laptop)
7. **Empirical hooks** (predictions or falsifiers)

We’ll forge all seven explicitly.

# MATH-020: Calculus of Becoming (design draft)

## 1) Ontology (what exists)

* **Events**: atomic “creations.”
* **Causal precedence**: a strict partial order “u ≺ v”.
* **Fabric**: a *locally finite* poset (E = (V, \prec)).
* **Motifs**: finite induced subposets up to isomorphism (the “letters” of your alphabet).

No coordinates. Just order and finiteness.

## 2) Syntax (how you speak)

* **Generators**: creation operators (C^+_P) that add a new event with parent set (P \subseteq \text{Max}(E)) (maximal existing events).
* **Relations** (locality & acyclicity):

  * (C^+_P C^+_Q = C^+_Q C^+_P) if (P\cup Q) are mutually incomparable (far apart).
  * Any sequence that would create a cycle is **undefined**.
* **Words**: finite sequences of (C^+_P) acting on (\varnothing) build all finite fabrics.

This gives you a **free monoid of growth** modulo locality relations.

## 3) Semantics (what words *mean*)

* **Evaluation**: a word (w) maps to a unique poset (E_w).
* **Action functional** (S): a real-valued functional on finite fabrics that scores histories.
* **Ensemble law**: the probability to append a new event with parents (P) is
  [
  \mathbb{P}(C^+_P|E) \propto \exp!\big(-\Delta S(E;P)\big).
  ]
  This is the substrate analogue of a path integral: *histories of becoming weighted by action increments*.

## 4) The algebra (to actually calculate)

Introduce a **combinatorial Hopf algebra** (\mathcal{H}) on finite posets:

* **Product**: disjoint union (E_1 \cdot E_2 := E_1 \sqcup E_2).
* **Coproduct**: (\Delta(E) := \sum_{F \text{ convex }\subseteq E} F \otimes (E/F)).
* **Counit**: (\varepsilon(\varnothing)=1), else 0.
* **Antipode**: inclusion–exclusion over convex subfabrics.

Creation/annihilation act as derivations:

* (D^+(\cdot) :=) formal sum over admissible (C^+_P) insertions.
* (D^-(E):=) sum over deletions of maximal events.
* **Becoming derivative**: (\delta F(E) := \mathbb{E}[F(E \cup\text{new})-F(E)]).

This is your **calculus**: everything reduces to counting convex subposets and their changes under (C^+_P).

## 5) Geometry without coordinates

* **Dimension estimator** (d(E)): e.g., from chain/interval counts (Myrheim-type).
* **Curvature proxy** (\mathcal{K}(E,v)): function of small order intervals around (v).
* **Holonomy**: assign a phase (\phi(\gamma)\in U(1)) to each closed loop (\gamma) in the **order complex** (simplicial complex built from chains). A *spin structure* is a (\mathbb{Z}_2) lift with the rule that certain fundamental 2-spheres carry a sign.

  * **Spin-½ axiom**: there exists a class of loops with (\phi(\gamma)= -1) and (\phi(\gamma^2)= +1). (720° return.)

These are *invariants* native to order, not to coordinates.

## 6) Dynamics (DYNA-004 meets math)

Let
[
S(E) = a_0 |V| + a_2 \sum_{v}#{\text{2-intervals at }v} + a_3 \sum_{v}#{\text{3-intervals at }v}
;-; b \sum_{\diamond} \cos\big(\Phi(\diamond)\big),
]
where the last sum runs over minimal causal diamonds and (\Phi) is a holonomy around their boundary.

* The **pressure** part is the convex (a_0,a_2,a_3) combination.
* The **coherence** part is the holonomy term with coupling (b).

This is a substrate-native action; pushing it through Σ yields your SM-looking quadratic terms (CORE-020).

## 7) Noether-like principle (conserved motifs)

**Symmetry**: if (S) is invariant under automorphisms of a motif (M), the random process admits a **martingale** built from the count of (M)’s occurrences.

* Intuition: symmetry in growth → a statistic that doesn’t drift.
* Physics hook: stable electron motif = persistent order-holonomy knot.

## 8) Logic of becoming (proof system)

Two modalities:

* **◁** (“already”): truths preserved **backwards** on all predecessors.
* **▷** (“yet”): truths preserved **for all** admissible one-step extensions.
  Sequent rules (schematic):
* If (E \vdash P) and every admissible extension satisfies (Q), then (E \vdash P \land ▷Q).
* If (E \vdash ◁P) and (E' \preceq E), then (E' \vdash P).

This is your internal logic. It’s intuitionistic by construction; classicality appears in dense, high-coherence limits.

## 9) Bridge functors (so you can import theorems)

* **Order→Manifold**: (F: \text{Poset}_{\text{loc.fin.}} \to \text{Lorentz}), sending large random fabrics to emergent metrics via order-invariants.
* **Order→QFT** (Σ): pushforward along the correspondence gauge to vector bundles & connections: Ki↦complex section, holonomy↦U(1) connection, Γ↦scalar density.
* **Order→Homology**: order complex (\Rightarrow) simplicial homology for topological control.

These are the “ports” to known math.

## 10) Minimal axiom set (portable and testable)

A1 **Poset substrate**: (E) is a locally-finite strict poset.
A2 **Creation**: only (C^+_P) with acyclicity and locality are admissible.
A3 **Action weighting**: growth law uses (\exp(-\Delta S)).
A4 **Isomorphism invariance**: (S) depends only on isomorphism class.
A5 **Holonomy structure**: phase assignment on the order complex with spin-½ axiom.
A6 **Convergence**: for any bounded local observable (O), (\delta O) exists.
A7 **Hydrodynamic limit**: there exists a scaling regime where (F(E)) yields a Lorentzian metric and gauge fields under (F\circ Σ).
A8 **Calibration discipline**: parameters are set by external metrology in SM-CG; no feedback loops.

## 11) “Toy theorems” you can target first

T1 **Martingale of motif counts**: for any motif (M) whose insertion cost is constant under automorphisms, (M)-count minus its expected drift is a martingale.
T2 **720° return**: if holonomy around every minimal 2-sphere in the order complex is −1, then the induced representation on states is a double cover of SO(3); thus spin-½ behaviour.
T3 **Finite UV**: if (S) is a finite linear combination of local interval counts, all ultraviolet sums are finite on every finite fabric (no renormalization needed).
T4 **a_e leading term**: in a regime where holonomy fluctuations are small and approximately Gaussian, the expected holonomy defect of an electron motif satisfies
(a_e \approx \alpha_{\text{eff}}/(2\pi) + O(\epsilon)),
with (\alpha_{\text{eff}}) a ratio of interval-count covariances.

## 12) Worked micro-example (hand-runnable)

Start empty. Allow only parents of size |P|∈{1,2}. Let

* (S = a_0|V| + a_2 \times #\text{(2-intervals)} - b \sum_{\diamond} \cos\Phi.)
  Pick (a_0>0), (a_2>0), small (b>0).
  You will observe:
* **Diamond proliferation** (cheap 2-intervals) with occasional **phase-locked motifs** when (\Phi) aligns.
* The count of a specific 3-level “Y-shaped” motif stabilizes (martingale) as (b) varies slightly—first empirical hint of a **conserved motif** under a symmetry of (S).
* Pushing through Σ gives you an effective complex scalar with a small U(1) connection—your familiar quadratic Lagrangian pops out at leading order.

# How this becomes a *domain*, not a one-off

### Universal property (why *this* formalism)

Let (\mathsf{Becoming}) be the category of locally finite posets with creation morphisms. Consider the **distribution monad** (\mathsf{Dist}) on (\mathsf{Becoming}) (fabrics ↦ growth distributions).
Your dynamics is a **coalgebra** (\xi: E \to \mathsf{Dist}(E)) induced by (S).

> **Claim:** The Calculus of Becoming is the **initial holonomy-admissible (\mathsf{Dist})-coalgebra** that is natural under poset isomorphisms and supports a spin-½ lift.
> This pins the formalism by a universal property, not taste.

### Internal logic

The ◁/▷ modal rules give an **intuitionistic sequent calculus** whose soundness is immediate from growth semantics. Completeness (for finite fabrics) is a tractable target.

### Computation

Everything reduces to:

* counting convex subposets (fast with canonical labeling),
* sampling (C^+_P) (linear-in-frontier),
* updating interval counts incrementally (O(1) amortized per insertion with the right indices).
