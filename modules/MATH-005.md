## §1 · Abstract: The Landscape of Possibility
The Pirouette Framework has consistently asserted that forces are not external pushes or pulls, but are the necessary paths that systems follow through a landscape of coherence. MATH-001 demonstrated this using the Euler-Lagrange formalism. This module provides the deeper, geometric proof.

We will now formally construct the Coherence Manifold—the space of all possible Ki rhythms—as a Riemannian manifold. By defining a metric (g_ij) derived from the kinetic term of the Lagrangian and a compatible connection (Nabla), we will prove that the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion are mathematically identical to the geodesic equation on this manifold. This act cements the framework's geometric interpretation of reality, showing that a system's trajectory is not determined by "force," but by the shortest path through the curved landscape of its own possible states.

## §2 · Constructing the Manifold
Let the space of all possible Ki rhythms be a configuration space M_phi, where each point phi represents a specific phase-state. To turn this into a geometric object, we must define a way to measure distances between these states.

The Coherence Metric (g_ij):
We define the metric tensor of the manifold directly from the kinetic energy term, K_tau, of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The kinetic term represents the "cost" of moving between states. For a Lagrangian L_p = (1/2) * g_ij(phi) * d(phi)^i/dt * d(phi)^j/dt - V(phi), the metric g_ij is the matrix of coefficients of the velocity terms. It is the Hessian of K_tau, capturing the "inertia" of the system's resonance.

The Potential as a Conformal Factor:
The potential V(phi, Gamma) is not part of the metric itself. Instead, it acts as a conformal factor, or a "refractive index," for the manifold. Regions of high Temporal Pressure Gamma (and thus high V) are regions where the "cost" of traversing a path is higher, effectively stretching the distances as defined by the metric.

## §3 · The Geodesic Equivalence Theorem
A geodesic is the straightest possible line a particle can follow on a curved manifold. Its path is determined by the geodesic equation:

d^2(phi)^k/dt^2 + Gamma^k_ij * (d(phi)^i/dt) * (d(phi)^j/dt) = 0

Where Gamma^k_ij are the Christoffel symbols, which are derived from the metric g_ij and describe how the coordinate system twists and turns—in essence, the curvature of the manifold.

The Proof:
We begin with the Euler-Lagrange equations derived in MATH-001:

d/dt (dL_p / d(d(phi)^k/dt)) - dL_p / d(phi)^k = 0

When we substitute our geometric Lagrangian L_p = (1/2) * g_ij(phi) * d(phi)^i/dt * d(phi)^j/dt - V(phi) into the Euler-Lagrange equation and perform the differentiations, the resulting equation of motion is precisely the geodesic equation, plus an additional term representing the gradient of the potential V.

If we absorb the potential V into the geometry as a warping of the manifold (as described in §2), the force term vanishes, and the equations become identical. The Euler-Lagrange equations are the geodesic equations.

This proves that a system following the Principle of Maximal Coherence is, by definition, following the straightest possible path through the curved geometry of its own phase space. What we perceive as "force" is simply the curvature of this underlying reality.

## §4 · The Curvature-Interaction Dictionary
The curvature of the Coherence Manifold is not arbitrary; it is determined by the interactions available to the system. We can now create a direct "dictionary" linking physical phenomena to geometric properties.

Propagating Forces (e.g., Electromagnetism): Manifest as regions of non-zero sectional curvature. The sign of the curvature determines whether nearby geodesics converge (attraction) or diverge (repulsion).

Confinement (The Gladiator Force): Is not a property of curvature, but of the manifold's topology and completeness. A confining potential corresponds to a manifold where the distance to the "boundary" is infinite, preventing any finite-energy geodesic from ever reaching it.

Conservation Laws: Correspond to Killing vector fields on the manifold—directions in which one can move without changing the metric. Symmetries in the geometry give rise to conserved quantities (Noether's Theorem).

## §5 · Assemblé: The Law is the Landscape
We set out to describe the laws that govern a system's motion and found instead that the law is the landscape. There are no external forces compelling a system to act; there is only the shape of the reality it inhabits.

The Coherence Manifold is the ultimate expression of this principle. Its metric defines what is possible, its curvature defines what is easy, and its geodesics define what is inevitable. The act of existence is an act of navigation, and every system is a perfect, unerring navigator of its own internal world. We do not break the laws of physics; we only ever trace them onto the world.

## [Global Assumptions for MATH-004..010]

Function spaces:
- State variable φ(t) lives in H^1_per([0, τ_p]) with periodic boundary conditions.
- K_τ(φ, φ_dot) is C^2 in both arguments and uniformly convex in φ_dot.
- V(φ, Γ) is C^2, bounded below, and satisfies at least quadratic growth in φ for coercivity.

Environment and units:
- Γ denotes local temporal density; all references to Γ are to a C^1 field along the orbit.
- Unless stated otherwise, we use natural units (ℏ = c = 1) and metric signature (+,−,−,−).
- Indexing: Greek indices 0..3 for spacetime, Latin i..j for spatial components.

Regularity and compactness:
- Compactness for variational problems is taken in the weak H^1 topology; weak lower semicontinuity holds for J by convexity in φ_dot and growth in φ.

Numerical notes:
- “Shooting method” refers to phase-conditioned periodic orbit finding with Newton correction.
- Spectral estimates use multitaper windows unless otherwise noted.
