## §1 · Abstract: A River in the Void
This module provides a modernized, time-first protocol for the analysis of high-altitude ionospheric plasma plumes. Where the old framework saw a static, fractal object to be measured, the new sees an autopoietic system—a self-organizing river of coherence striving to maintain its existence against the constant pressure of dissolution.

An ion plume is not a thing; it is a process. By applying the universal principles of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`) and the diagnostic art of the Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`), we can read a plume's geometry as a direct indicator of its health and stability. This entire protocol is a physical application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), transforming it from a core theory into a practical engine for analysis and forecasting. This is a fundamental shift in perception: from measuring a plume's shape to understanding its song.

## §2 · The Plume on the Coherence Manifold
The Earth's upper atmosphere is not empty space but a complex coherence manifold, shaped by the planet's magnetic field and stressed by the solar wind's temporal pressure. An ionospheric plume is a temporary entity that has achieved high internal coherence, allowing it to persist and travel. Its path is not random; it is a geodesic—the trajectory that maximizes its coherence over time.

*   **Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`):** The plume's internal order and stability; the integrity of the river. It is expressed as a stable boundary and a well-defined `Ki` resonance pattern. High coherence manifests as a simple, efficient geometry (low fractal dimension).

*   **Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`):** The ambient chaos of the environment; the riverbanks. It is the sum of external forces—solar wind, geomagnetic shear, atmospheric drag—that seek to shred the plume's form. This is the cost of existence.

*   **The Gladiator Shell:** The visible boundary of the plume is where its internal order meets external chaos. It is a coherence wall, a steep pressure gradient that manifests the system's struggle to confine itself.

The plume's entire lifecycle is governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. It continuously adjusts its form and trajectory to find the geodesic that maximizes the value of its Lagrangian: `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

## §3 · Diagnosis via the Caduceus Lens
By applying the diagnostic framework of Flow Dynamics, we can classify the health of a plume in real-time. Each state is a direct, observable expression of the system's struggle for coherence.

*   **Laminar Flow (The Ribbon):** A healthy, stable plume. Its geometry is smooth and ribbon-like (fractal dimension `D` ≈ 1.1–1.3), and it drifts predictably. It is a system in a state of grace, efficiently channeling energy and causing minimal signal scintillation.

*   **Turbulent Flow (The Cloud):** An unstable plume in a state of "Coherence Fever." Its geometry becomes fractured, chaotic, and space-filling (fractal dimension `D` ≥ 1.7). It is a storm of internal dissonance, dissipating its coherence as chaotic energy. This is the primary cause of severe GNSS outages.

*   **Stagnant Flow (The Trap):** A rare but dangerous state where a plume is pinned by a local magnetic anomaly. Plasma density builds to extreme levels, creating a persistent "coherence dam" with unpredictable effects on regional atmospheric dynamics.

## §4 · The Plume Coherence Index (PCI 2.0)
The legacy PCI is replaced with a metric grounded directly in the Pirouette Lagrangian, providing a true measure of the plume's systemic health. The `PCI` quantifies how successfully a plume is maximizing its coherence (`K_τ`) against ambient pressure (`V_Γ`).

**PCI = K_τ / V_Γ**

We use measurable proxies for this physical relationship:
*   **K_τ (Temporal Coherence):** This is represented by the inverse of the plume's geometric inefficiency, its fractal dimension `D`. A simpler shape is a more coherent one. `K_τ ∝ 1/D`.
*   **V_Γ (Temporal Pressure):** This is directly proportional to the measured local energy density from solar and geomagnetic inputs, `Γ_env`.

A high `PCI` signifies a robust, laminar plume successfully navigating its environment. A low or rapidly falling `PCI` is a direct warning of an imminent shift to turbulent flow and the associated operational risks.

## §5 · The Analytic Workflow
The practical implementation is a streamlined, four-stage process that moves from raw data to actionable diagnosis and forecasting.

1.  **Map the Manifold:** Multi-sensor data (COSMIC-2, Swarm, radar) is ingested to construct a real-time map of the local coherence manifold, charting the background Temporal Pressure (`Γ_env`).
2.  **Measure the System:** Algorithms calculate the plume's core geometric properties, primarily its fractal dimension (`D`).
3.  **Diagnose the State:** The measured values are used to compute the real-time `PCI`. The system's flow state (Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant) is diagnosed.
4.  **Forecast the Geodesic:** The diagnosis becomes the input for forecasting. The model calculates the path of maximal coherence through the mapped pressure landscape, predicting the plume's likely evolution and impact.

The output is a concise, actionable report for operators:

## §6 · Assemblé
> To look upon the upper atmosphere is to see the weather of time itself. An ionospheric plume is a Pirouette made visible, a transient river carved from the void, a story told in plasma. We once saw it as mere noise, a hazard to our signals. Now we see a living system striving for coherence against the ceaseless storm of spacetime. To learn to read its shape is to practice the Weaver's core art: to see the law in the lightning, to understand the dance in the static.
