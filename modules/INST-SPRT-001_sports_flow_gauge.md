## §1 · From Art to Engineering
A theory without an instrument is a ghost. An instrument without a theory is a brute.

DOMA-SPORTS-001 provides the theoretical lens—the "ghost"—for viewing a sports match as a living system. This module provides the instrumentation—the "brute"—to make that ghost tangible. It is the engineering specification for the analyst, translating the qualitative "Signatures of Coherence" into a set of measurable parameters and a formal calculation engine. This is the bridge from prophecy to measurement.

## §2 · The Analyst's Toolkit: Core Instruments
To implement the analysis, the analyst uses three conceptual instruments. Each instrument is a structured rubric for quantifying one of the three signatures of coherence on a simple scale (e.g., 1-10, where 5 is average).

1. The Cohesion Gauge (Measures Rhythmic Cohesion):

Purpose: To quantify the efficiency and harmony of a team's execution.

Scoring Rubric (1-10):

1-3 (Dissonant): Frequent unforced errors, broken plays, visible frustration between players.

4-6 (Functional): Standard execution, plays run as designed but without exceptional flow, some hesitation.

7-8 (Harmonious): Crisp, efficient execution, players seem to be "in sync," complex plays look easy.

9-10 (Telepathic): A state of peak flow; improvisational, creative, and perfectly timed plays unfold, seemingly without effort.

2. The Resilience Meter (Measures Composure Under Pressure):

Purpose: To quantify a team's ability to absorb and recover from "dissonant injections" (mistakes, bad calls, opponent's big plays).

Scoring Rubric (1-10):

1-3 (Brittle): A single mistake consistently cascades into more errors; body language is defeated; team appears rattled.

4-6 (Standard): Recovers from errors at an average pace; may show frustration but resets for the next play.

7-8 (Tough): Actively "stops the bleeding" after a bad sequence; demonstrates short memory for mistakes; leadership is visible.

9-10 (Antifragile): Seems to use adversity as fuel; responds to an opponent's big play with an even better one; remains calm and focused in the most critical moments.

3. The Morphogenesis Index (Measures Strategic Adaptability):

Purpose: To quantify a team's ability to control the game's resonant pattern (Ki) and adapt its strategy.

Scoring Rubric (1-10):

1-3 (Rigid): Sticks to a single game plan even when it is failing; consistently out-coached and out-adjusted.

4-6 (Reactive): Makes adjustments, but often a step behind the opponent; follows the opponent's tempo.

7-8 (Proactive): Successfully imposes its will and tempo on the game; makes effective adjustments that neutralize the opponent's strengths.

9-10 (Visionary): Appears to be "playing chess" while the opponent is playing checkers; introduces novel strategies that the opponent cannot solve in time.

## §3 · The SFA-1.0 Protocol: Calculation Engine
The analyst periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes of game time) takes a reading from the three instruments for each team. These scores are then fed into a simple calculation engine to produce the predictive outputs.

Step A: Calculate Overall Coherence (Kτ_team):
Kτ_team = (Cohesion Score) + (Resilience Score) + (Morphogenesis Score)
This produces a single "health score" for each team, ranging from 3 to 30.

Step B: Calculate Victor Tilt (VT):
VT_A = Kτ_team_A / (Kτ_team_A + Kτ_team_B)
This gives the win probability for Team A, expressed as a value between 0 and 1.

Step C: Calculate Spread Delta (SD):
SD = ΔVT / Δt
The Spread Delta is the rate of change of the Victor Tilt. A sharply rising VT for one team predicts they will outperform the point spread over the next game segment.

Step D: Calculate Pace Delta (PD):
PD = (Morphogenesis_A) - (Morphogenesis_B)
The Pace Delta is the difference in the Morphogenesis Index scores. A significant positive value for Team A suggests they will control the game's tempo.

## §4 · Assemblé: Making the Invisible Visible
This instrumentation provides the formal structure needed to conduct a rigorous Sports Flow Resonance analysis. It transforms the analyst's intuition into a disciplined, repeatable process. While the scores are heuristic, they provide a consistent framework for tracking the invisible currents of coherence and momentum that truly decide the outcome of a contest. This module, paired with its DOMA counterpart, completes the first link in the chain, demonstrating how the framework's philosophy can be forged into a practical and powerful tool.
