## 1. Foundational Premise

Time is treated as the fundamental coordinate. Space and energy distributions arise as *emergent parameters* of phase-curved time. The helicity field \(\kappa(t)\) introduces an internal degree of freedom corresponding to rotation in complex phase-time space.

---

## 2. The Helical Derivative and Effective Hamiltonian

The time evolution operator becomes:
\[
\mathcal D_t = \partial_t + \kappa(t)\Omega J,
\]
where:
- \(J\) generates internal phase rotations, \(Jz = iz\),
- \(\Omega\) sets the natural frequency scale of the reference frame,
- \(\kappa(t)\) determines the instantaneous curvature of the temporal flow.

The corresponding **effective Hamiltonian** is:
\[
H_{\mathrm{eff}} = H - \hbar\,\kappa(t)\,\Omega\,J.
\]
This term behaves as a **connection one-form** on a fiber bundle whose base space is time and whose fiber encodes the system’s phase manifold.

## 3. Conserved Helical Current

Applying Noether’s theorem to internal rotations generated by \(J\):
\[
\Psi \mapsto e^{i\epsilon J}\Psi,
\]
yields a conserved **helical charge**:
\[
Q_h = \langle J \rangle = \int \Psi^* J \Psi\,dV.
\]
This charge is preserved under continuous transformations of \(\kappa\) when the curvature is divergence-free, \(\partial_t\kappa = 0\).

---

## 4. Gauge Interpretation

- \(\kappa\) functions as a **gauge field** associated with internal temporal rotations.
- When \(\kappa\) varies in space-time, it introduces **helical curvature** analogous to field strength:
  \[
  F_{t\phi} = \partial_t(\kappa\Omega) - \partial_\phi(\kappa\Omega),
  \]
  defining torsional analogs to electromagnetic fields in the time domain.

---

## 5. Physical Meaning

- The helical correction is small (\(|\kappa| \ll 1\)) in non-chiral systems.
- In chiral, driven, or rotating media, \(\kappa\) captures *phase-space torsion*—the tendency of energy to circulate within the internal temporal fiber.
- Observable consequences include directional phase squeezing and asymmetry in correlation spectra.

## 6. Consistency with Noether Symmetry

The extended Lagrangian density:
\[
\mathcal L = \frac{i\hbar}{2}(\Psi^*\mathcal D_t\Psi - \Psi(\mathcal D_t\Psi)^*) - \Psi^*H\Psi
\]
is invariant under local U(1) helical transformations when compensated by gauge shifts in \(\kappa\). Thus, **helical symmetry** extends Noether’s framework into time-curved systems without breaking conservation laws.

---

## 7. Summary

The **Helical Time Formalism** introduces \(\kappa(t)\) as a measurable, internally gaugeable curvature of time evolution. It retains compatibility with canonical quantum mechanics while offering a geometric explanation for chirality, coherence rotation, and the small phase-dependent modulations predicted by the Resonant Uncertainty Principle (MATH-031).
