## §1 · Abstract: The Indelible Vow
A framework that preaches a universe of memory and consequence cannot be written in disappearing ink. Its own history must be as indelible as the one it seeks to describe. An unverified change is not an evolution; it is a breach, a source of turbulence that erodes the entire structure.

This module reframes the technical necessity of build verification as a core philosophical practice. It defines the **Ritual of Provenance**, the technical and philosophical protocol that governs the evolution of the Pirouette Framework. At the heart of this ritual is the **Seal of Coherence**, a cryptographic proof of the framework's state. The automated pipelines that enforce this Seal ensure that every change is a conscious, coherent, and traceable step, carving the framework's own evolution into a permanent record.

## §2 · The Wound Channel of the Canon
As established in CORE-011, every entity carves a **Wound Channel** in spacetime—a geometric record of its history. The Pirouette Framework, as a coherent system of thought, is no different. Its Wound Channel is the cumulative history of its development, recorded indelibly in its version control system.

The framework's core parameters—its fundamental constants, its defined relationships, its symbolic grammar—form the **Canon**. This Canon is the framework's DNA. To alter the Canon is to alter the framework's very nature. The Ritual of Provenance is the epigenetic process that ensures this DNA mutates with intention and perfect fidelity, deepening the Wound Channel without introducing corruption.

## §3 · The Seal of Coherence
To attest to the integrity of the Canon at any point in time, we employ a cryptographic hash (SHA256). This is the **Seal of Coherence**.

The Seal is not merely a checksum. It is the **Canonical Echo** of the framework's complete state. The hashing function acts as a resonance chamber, taking the complex pattern of the Canon and collapsing it into a single, high-fidelity, and unique signature.

-   **The Song:** The precise state of the Canon at a moment in time.
-   **The Echo:** The resulting SHA256 hash, which is the Seal of Coherence.

If a single constant is altered, the song changes, and the echo becomes profoundly different. The committed Seal in the framework's source code is the *memory* of the last canonical echo, the physical proof that a given version of the framework is internally consistent and true to its documented form.

`Seal of Coherence = SHA256(The Canon)`

## §4 · The Ritual of Provenance: A Twofold Path
The ritual is enforced through an unyielding automated workflow, transforming the act of coding from a private activity into a public, accountable act of weaving.

### I. The Weaver's Vow (The Pre-commit Hook)
Before a Weaver can contribute their thread to the loom, they must make a local vow of integrity. A pre-commit script automatically calculates the Seal of Coherence from their proposed changes. If it does not match the documented Seal, the contribution is halted. This prevents accidental dissonance from ever entering the shared channel.

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
echo "▶ Pirouette Canon: Verifying Seal of Coherence..."
python scripts/verify_seal.py || {
  echo "✖ Coherence Fault: Canon has changed. Run 'python scripts/verify_seal.py --attest' to reforge the Seal."
  exit 1
}
```

### II. The Loom's Test (The CI Pipeline)
When a Weaver's changes are proposed to the collective, the central loom performs its own independent verification. The continuous integration (CI) pipeline rebuilds the entire framework from source and recalculates the Seal. If this newly forged Seal does not match the one attested to in the Weaver's contribution, the build fails. This is a **Coherence Fault**, the system's immune response to a change that is not in harmony with the whole, protecting the integrity of the Wound Channel.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pirouette-build.yml
# ...
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: python compiler.py --build-canon
      - name: The Loom's Test - Verify Seal of Coherence
        run: python scripts/verify_seal.py
```

## §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian
This entire protocol is the practical implementation of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006) applied to the framework's own evolution. The CI pipeline acts as the Euler-Lagrange operator, enforcing the *Principle of Maximal Coherence*.

> 𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)

In this context:
-   **Temporal Coherence** is represented by the match between the newly calculated Seal and the historically committed Seal. A perfect match is a state of maximal coherence.
-   **Temporal Pressure** is the proposed change—the developer's commit, an injection of new information that seeks to alter the system's state.

A failing build is the mathematical proof that the proposed change introduces dissonance, knocking the system off its geodesic of maximal coherence. By refusing to accept such changes, the pipeline ensures the framework's evolution itself follows a path of laminar flow, forcing every modification to be a deliberate, attested-to step toward increasing clarity. To update the Seal is the final act of this ritual: a declaration that a new, coherent state has been achieved and must now be remembered.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We do not merely write about the Wound Channel; we build one for our own ideas. The Seal is the geometry of our memory, and the Ritual is the chisel that carves it. Every hash is a knot in the thread of our reasoning, a promise that the story we tell about ourselves is the story we are actually living.
