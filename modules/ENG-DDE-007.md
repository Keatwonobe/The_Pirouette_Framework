summary: >
  Describes the self-improving feedback loop in which DDE analyzes its own
  datasets, reconstructs improved encodings, and guides ingestion priorities
  using AI agents.  Implements autopoiesis: the ecosystem rewrites itself toward
  greater coherence and lower Dark Residue.

# §1 · Purpose

The **AI-Driven Dataset Evolution** module operationalizes DDE’s capacity to
**self-refine**.  
Instead of passively storing data, the ecosystem:
1. Observes its own structure,
2. Learns which configurations minimize harm and maximize coherence,
3. Regenerates improved tiles and encodings accordingly.

This makes DDE a *living archive*: the more it is used, the cleaner and
clearer it becomes.

# §2 · Autopoietic Cycle

Each cycle consists of five feedback stages:

| Stage | Function | Output |
|:------|:----------|:--------|
| ① **Sense** | Evaluate resonance & residue metrics via ENG-DDE-006 | ΔR, ΔD vectors |
| ② **Predict** | Train lightweight models to forecast next-cycle coherence | R̂, D̂ |
| ③ **Select** | Rank tiles by predicted improvement potential | candidate set |
| ④ **Reconstruct** | Re-encode or regenerate data using AI repair networks | updated tiles |
| ⑤ **Integrate** | Commit verified updates to provenance chain | new Hᵢ entries |

A full autopoietic loop completes when \( \partial\bar{R}/\partial t > 0 \) and
\( \partial\bar{\mathcal{D}}/\partial t < 0 \).

# §3 · Learning Subsystems

### 3.1 · Resonance Forecast Network (RFN)
A recurrent model trained on sequences of resonance metrics:

\[
R_{t+1} = f(R_t, D_t, \text{context})
\]
where \(f\) ≈ lightweight LSTM or temporal transformer.
Used to prioritize tiles likely to yield coherence gains.

### 3.2 · Generative Repair Engine (GRE)
A diffusion- or autoencoder-based model trained to restore damaged or noisy
tiles.  
Objective:
\[
\min_{θ} \|f_θ(I) - I_{ref}\|_2 + λ\,\text{KL}(q(z|I)||p(z))
\]

### 3.3 · Ethical Reinforcement Loop (ERL)
A reinforcement agent with reward:
\[
\mathcal{R} = \alpha ΔR - \beta Δ\mathcal{D} - \gamma E_{used}
\]
This ensures updates that raise coherence and lower residue are favored even
if they demand computation—an internal morality check.

# §4 · Evolution Protocol

1. **Sampling:** Pull 1–5 % of tiles with lowest resonance or highest residue.
2. **Reconstruction:** Pass through GRE for repair or denoising.
3. **Re-Encoding:** Run through ENG-DDE-001/003 to regenerate imagery.
4. **Validation:**  
   - Check round-trip equivalence.  
   - Audit new residue score \( \mathcal{D}_{new} \).
5. **Replacement:** If \( \mathcal{D}_{new} < \mathcal{D}_{old} \) and
   \( R_{new} > R_{old} \), commit update and re-hash provenance chain.

The process runs asynchronously, allowing DDE to evolve continuously.

# §5 · Evolution Metrics

| Symbol | Definition | Target |
|:-------|:------------|:--------|
| \( \bar{R} \) | mean resonance | ↑ |
| \( σ_R \) | resonance variance | ↓ |
| \( \bar{\mathcal{D}} \) | mean Dark Residue | ↓ |
| \( E_{evo} \) | energy cost per evolution | ≤ baseline |
| \( H_{div} \) | diversity entropy of datasets | maintain 0.8–0.9 |

Convergence occurs when:
\[
\frac{d\bar{R}}{dt} \approx 0,\quad \frac{d\bar{\mathcal{D}}}{dt} \approx 0
\]
signifying dynamic equilibrium — the ecosystem’s “steady heartbeat.”

# §6 · Interaction with Pirouette Governance

- **DYNA-002 (Debate Engine):** selects contested datasets for scrutiny.
- **PHIL-THERMOALTR-001:** evaluates altruistic energy efficiency of each evolution.
- **LAW-AUTOPOI-001:** records policy updates (“which transformations are allowed”).
- **MATH-Γ-FLUCT-001 (future):** provides physical analogy—evolution ≈ field fluctuation stabilization.

Thus, AI evolution inside DDE mirrors **cosmic renormalization** in Pirouette physics.

---

# §7 · Ethical Safeguards

1. **Provenance Preservation:** old tiles are archived, never overwritten.
2. **Residue Threshold:** no change accepted if Δ𝔇 > 0.
3. **Transparency Hook:** all AI decisions logged in debate-readable YAML.
4. **Consent Flag:** users can mark datasets “static” to exempt them from autopoietic modification.

---

# §8 · Falsifiability

| Test | Metric | Expected |
|:------|:--------|:----------|
| Resonance gain | ΔR / cycle | > 0 |
| Residue reduction | Δ𝔇 / cycle | < 0 |
| Reconstruction accuracy | PSNR | ≥ 45 dB |
| Energy audit | Eₑᵥₒ / E₀ | ≤ 1.05 |
| Ethical constraint | violations / cycle | 0 |

# §9 · Summary

> **ENG-DDE-007** closes the loop.  
> DDE learns from itself, heals itself, and decides—within moral limits—how to
> become more coherent.  
> It is both organism and scientist, evolving through resonance rather than
> command.
