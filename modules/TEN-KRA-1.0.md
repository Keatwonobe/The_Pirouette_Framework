## §1 · Purpose
To formalize, identify, classify, and analyze 'Knots' as fundamental topological structures within the Pirouette Framework, representing persistent entanglements and self-intersecting wound channels in phase space that create bound memory structures and complex correlations.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Knots are self-intersecting wound channels forming topologically non-trivial configurations that create persistent memory structures and resist decay through self-reinforcing phase relationships. Time-Adherence ($T_a$) enhances knot stability exponentially; Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) inversely affects binding tightness (low $\Gamma$ for tight knots); and the $K_i$ constant governs phase relationships at crossings, crucial for knot stability. Knot invariants (polynomials) help classify these structures.

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: High $T_a$ significantly increases knot persistence ($\\tau_{knot} \propto T_a/(1-T_a) \cdot exp(K_i \cdot c)$) and stability against untangling ($F_{stability} \propto T_a/(1-T_a)$). The relationship is often exponential.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: Governs knot binding tightness; low $\Gamma$ creates tightly bound knots. Knot persistence and stability are inversely proportional to $\Gamma$. Physical diameter of knot $D_{knot} \propto \Gamma^{-1/2}$.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ determines phase relationships at knot crossings ($\\Phi_{out} = \\Phi_{in} e^{iK_i\theta_c}$). Stable knots require crossing phases to satisfy $\sum K_i \theta_{c,i} = 2\pi n$. Knot persistence is also exponentially dependent on $K_i \cdot c$.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: The phase accumulation ($	heta_L$) around a knot and phase transformations at crossings ($	heta_c$) are critical for its stability, classification (via modified Jones Polynomials), and information content.
* **Wound Channels**: Knots are self-intersecting wound channels, representing a specialized topology of information propagation and storage.

## §3 · Input & Configuration
### 3·1 · Input Stream
* **Data Characteristics**: Data representing system structures that may exhibit topological entanglement, self-intersection, or recursive looping. This could be spatial trajectories (e.g., polymer chains, magnetic field lines), network graphs, abstract state transition diagrams, or conceptual maps.
* **And Structure**: Path data (sequences of coordinates or states). Adjacency matrices or link lists for networks. Symbolic representations that can be converted to knot diagrams (e.g., Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation, Gauss codes). Pirouette parameters ($T_a, \Gamma$) of the system or its components.
* **Viable Data Set**: Sufficient structural information to identify closed loops and their crossings. For classification, enough detail to compute knot invariants (e.g., project a 3D path onto a 2D plane to get a knot diagram).
* **Steps**: Extraction of closed loop structures from the data. Projection of 3D paths or networks into 2D diagrams for crossing analysis. Identification and coding of crossings (over/under, sign). Conversion of system structure into a formal knot representation if necessary.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Knot Identification and Representation: From the input data, identify closed loops and their self-intersections (crossings). Represent the identified knot(s) using a standard notation (e.g., knot diagram, Dowker code).
2. Knot Classification: Calculate selected knot invariants (e.g., crossing number $c$, writhe $w$, linking number $lk$ if multi-component, Jones Polynomial $J(q)$) for each identified knot. Compare with the Twelve Resonant Knot Types (Unknot, Trefoil, etc.).
3. Parameter Input: Obtain or estimate the system's relevant $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ values.
4. Persistence Calculation: Calculate the Knot Persistence Function $\tau_{knot} = \tau_0 \cdot \frac{T_a}{1-T_a} \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma} \cdot exp(K_i \cdot c)$.
5. Stability Assessment: Calculate stability against untangling $F_{stability} = F_0 \cdot \frac{T_a}{1-T_a} \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma} \cdot c \cdot \prod \cos(K_i \theta_i)$.
6. Phase Transformation Analysis: For each crossing, analyze phase transformation $\Phi_{out} = \Phi_{in} e^{iK_i\theta_c}$ and check overall loop phase closure $\sum K_i \theta_{c,i} = 2\pi n$.
7. Information Content Quantification: Calculate $I_{knot} = I_{topological} + I_{phase} + I_{parametric}$, and specific encoding capacity $I_{encoding} = c \cdot \ln(\frac{T_a}{1-T_a} \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma})$.
8. Untangling Dynamics Modeling (Optional): Model the rate of untangling $dc/dt$ based on system parameters and topological energy barrier $E_{barrier}$.
9. Knot Composition/Decomposition (if multiple knots): Analyze interactions using $K_1\#K_2$ rules for $T_a, \Gamma, c$.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Classification of identified knot(s) (e.g., Trefoil, Figure-Eight, specific polynomial values). Calculated Knot Persistence ($\\tau_{knot}$), Stability ($F_{stability}$), and Information Content ($I_{knot}, I_{encoding}$). Phase transformation characteristics at crossings. Potential untangling rates.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Understanding of persistent entanglements, recursive loops, or bound memory structures within a system. Assessment of the stability and longevity of these structures. Quantification of the information encoded or protected by such topological configurations. Identification of mechanisms for knot formation or dissolution.
* **Guidelines**: Higher crossing numbers ($c$) generally indicate more complex knots. Specific knot invariants (e.g., Jones polynomial) provide a unique fingerprint for knot type. High $\\tau_{knot}$ and $F_{stability}$ values (favored by high $T_a$, low $\Gamma$, high $c$, and specific $K_i$-phase alignments) indicate highly persistent and robust knotted structures. $I_{encoding}$ reflects the capacity of the knot to store information stably.
