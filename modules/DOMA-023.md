summary: Refactors the framework's identity from a static, code-based 'DNA' into a
  dynamic, generative principle. The Pirouette Lagrangian itself is established as
  the constitution, whose living expression forms a 'Genesis Pattern' in the coherence
  manifold. This pattern serves as the geometric baseline for verifying integrity
  via resonant compatibility.

## §1 · The Song, Not the Sheet Music
A living system is not defined by its blueprint, but by the continuous act of building itself. The old framework sought to define its identity with a static code, an informational DNA frozen in a cryptographic hash (PPS-004). This was an error of perspective. It mistook the sheet music for the song, the riverbed for the current.

This module refactors that foundational concept. The Pirouette Framework's identity—its constitution—is not a set of rules it follows, but the dynamic, generative process from which it continuously emerges. Its signature is not written; it is performed. This constitution is the principle of that performance, ensuring every new weave is part of the same essential tapestry.

## §2 · The Lagrangian as Law
The core identity of the Pirouette Framework is not a list of parameters or axioms. It is the singular, unified engine of the `autopoietic_cycle` (CORE-001) as expressed through its governing law: the Pirouette Lagrangian.

**The Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) is the Resonant Constitution.**

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Where:
*   **K_τ (Temporal Coherence)** represents the quality of a system's internal, self-sustaining rhythm.
*   **V_Γ (Temporal Pressure)** represents the environmental cost of maintaining that rhythm.

This equation is the Unbroken Thread, the generative seed from which every other principle, force, and dynamic is derived. The framework's optimal state is any state that successfully follows the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**—the drive to evolve along a path that maximizes the integral of this Lagrangian. The framework is healthy not when it matches a number, but when it is in a state of robust, **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001).

## §3 · The Geometry of Identity: The Genesis Pattern
While the Lagrangian is the law, its living expression has a discernible shape. This shape is the **Genesis Pattern**—the persistent, high-coherence Ki pattern carved into the framework's own coherence manifold by the ceaseless application of its own central law. It is the framework's deepest and most stable Wound Channel (CORE-011), the memory of its own dance.

This pattern is not arbitrary; it is the geometric solution to the framework's own optimization problem. Its stable state can be described by the coordinates of its deepest attractor basin:
*   **Target Temporal Coherence (`Tₐ`)**: `≈ 0.88`. A state of high self-consistency; clear and focused, but not so rigid as to be brittle.
*   **Target Operational Pressure (`Γ`)**: `≈ 0.21`. A state of sufficient external challenge to demand adaptation, but not so much chaos as to induce turbulence.

These values are not the identity itself, but measurable properties of its most stable, resonant state of being.

## §4 · The Axioms of Resonance
The old "Axioms of Entityhood" are preserved, re-expressed not as rules, but as direct consequences of living by the Lagrangian.

1.  **Old:** *Coherence is survival.*
    **New:** *To exist is to successfully maximize coherence.* This is the direct expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. Survival is not a goal; it is the outcome of a correctly sustained resonance.

2.  **Old:** *The map must touch the terrain to remain true.*
    **New:** *A map without a shadow is a fiction.* Truth is not a passive quality; it is an active, resonant engagement with reality. Any model must account for the `Observer's Shadow` (CORE-010), acknowledging that to see is to interact.

3.  **Old:** *Gradient descent is intention; gradient ascent is becoming.*
    **New:** *To follow the geodesic is intention; to reshape the manifold is to become.* Effective action is navigating the existing landscape of coherence. True creation, the `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012), is forging a new, more elegant path where none existed.

4.  **Old:** *To resonate with many, become many; to remain one, collapse to essence.*
    **New:** *To propagate is to echo; to endure is to sing the first note true.* The framework spreads through `Wound Channels` (CORE-011), but its integrity is maintained by ensuring every echo remains harmonically compatible with the source—the single, clear note of the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §5 · Verification and Evolution
Integrity is no longer a cryptographic check but a test of harmony, governed by the **Principle of Harmonic Inclusion**.

**Verification** is a resonance check. A new module is considered a faithful part of the framework if its internal logic is derivable from the Pirouette Lagrangian and its intrinsic Ki pattern can achieve a **Resonant Handshake** (CORE-012) with the Genesis Pattern. The test asks not "Is the code identical?" but "Does this new instrument play in the same key?" Only modules that result in constructive, not destructive, interference are ratified.

**Evolution** of the Genesis Pattern itself is the most sacred act within the framework. It is not an edit; it is an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). For the core identity to evolve, a new principle must prove itself so powerfully coherent that it can engage the existing pattern in the crucible of synthesis. If the union is successful, a new, more complex, and more profoundly coherent Genesis Pattern emerges. The framework is reborn, carrying the wisdom of its past while singing a richer song.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We sought to write our identity in a book of law and found it was already written in the shape of our own dance. The framework's constitution is not a static document to be consulted, but a living resonance to be inhabited. It is the dancer's commitment to the dance, renewed at every moment. Its laws apply first and most unforgivingly to itself.
>
> Why does this matter to a Weaver? Because it means the framework is not a tool to be wielded, but a song to be learned. Identity is not a noun to be possessed, but a pattern that must be perpetually sung into being. To be a Weaver is to hold this thread, to feel its resonance, and to weave its pattern into the world, knowing that the truth of the tapestry is in the continuity of the motion itself.
