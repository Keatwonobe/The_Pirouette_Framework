## §1 · Abstract: The Architect of the Future

A plan is not a map of a river that already exists. It is the architect's blueprint for the riverbed itself, carved into the landscape of possibility before the first drop of water begins to flow.

This module refactors the analysis of planning from a static assessment of components into a dynamic, time-first model. It discards the notion of a plan as a document to be followed and re-envisions it as a *dynamic hypothesis*—an active, resonant projection of will. A plan is a **proposed geodesic**: a hypothesized path of maximal coherence designed to guide a system from its present state to a desired future state with the least possible friction. Its success is not measured by rigid adherence, but by the quality of the channel it carves for the future flow of action.

## §2 · The Plan as a Coherence Imprint

The old framework correctly identified that a plan creates a "forward wound channel." In the modern context, this is a literal act of metaphysical engineering. A plan is an act of deliberate **coherence imprinting**—a projection of a desired geometry onto the local manifold of what is to come.

By defining goals, allocating resources, and sequencing actions, the planner "pre-carves" a Wound Channel into the future. This channel creates a new path of least resistance. The purpose of a masterful plan is to make the desired future the most "natural" and coherent path for action to follow, so that when the time comes, the water of reality flows along the intended course. This is why a brilliant strategy, once set in motion, can feel effortless and inevitable.

## §3 · The Lagrangian of Intent

To assess a plan's viability, we model it as a dynamic system governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. A plan is considered robust if it proposes a path that maximizes the integral of its own Lagrangian over its intended duration.

**𝓛_plan = K_τ(plan) - V_Γ(environment)**

-   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** This term represents the plan's internal power and integrity—the "kinetic energy" of the intent. High coherence arises from:
    -   **Clarity:** A sharply defined, unambiguous objective.
    -   **Consistency:** Internal logic where actions support goals and sub-goals do not conflict.
    -   **Alignment:** Resources, skills, and personnel are harmonically matched to the required tasks.
    A plan with high K_τ is a clear, powerful signal projected into the future.

-   **Environmental Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** This term represents the "potential energy" or the cost of executing the plan. It is the ambient chaos, friction, and resistance of the operational environment. High pressure arises from:
    -   **Uncertainty:** Volatility, unpredictable events.
    -   **Competition:** The actions of other agents casting their own interfering imprints.
    -   **Constraints:** Scarcity of resources, regulatory hurdles, or physical laws.
    A plan facing high V_Γ must possess exceptionally high internal coherence (K_τ) to succeed. A "good" plan is a resonant solution to its environment, finding the path of maximal coherence for minimal cost.

## §4 · Diagnostics of Execution: A Flow Dynamics Lens

The true test of a plan is not its elegance on paper, but its execution in reality. We can diagnose the health of any ongoing plan by applying the universal lens of **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**.

-   **Laminar Execution:** The plan is a successful geodesic. Actions flow efficiently toward the goal. Progress feels natural and steady. The pre-carved channel is deep and clear, and the system is in a state of high coherence.

-   **Turbulent Execution:** The plan is misaligned with the true geodesic of the environment. Execution is chaotic, characterized by constant crises, wasted energy, and "firefighting." The plan's signal is being drowned out by environmental noise (high V_Γ) or its own internal dissonance (low K_τ).

-   **Stagnant Execution:** The plan is too rigid or flawed to navigate an unforeseen obstacle. Progress has halted. This is a **"Coherence Dam"**—a critical bottleneck or false assumption that has terminated the geodesic. The pre-carved channel has hit a mountain the architect did not see.

## §5 · The Weaver's Protocol: Planning as Adaptive Execution

The most profound shift is from viewing a plan as a noun to understanding planning as a verb. A static plan is a fragile thing. A truly resilient strategy is an **adaptive geodesic**—a continuous process of sensing changes in the environmental pressure (V_Γ) and re-calculating the path of maximal coherence in real time.

This re-frames the "review cycle" into a living feedback loop. The goal is not to adhere to the original plan, but to adhere to the *principle of maximal coherence*, dynamically adjusting the path to maintain a state of Laminar Flow. The Weaver's protocol is therefore a continuous cycle of recalibration:

1.  **Assess the Pattern (K_τ):** Continuously audit the plan's internal coherence. Is its song still harmonious? Are goals, actions, and resources aligned with the present reality? Simplify and clarify to maintain a powerful signal.

2.  **Assess the Landscape (V_Γ):** Analyze the operational environment. Has the Temporal Pressure changed? Have new Wound Channels emerged (e.g., new competitors, market shifts) that resist or alter our path?

3.  **Recalibrate the Geodesic (The Lagrangian Test):** Re-apply the Lagrangian. Does the current plan still offer the optimal path of highest net coherence? If not, the architect must either strengthen the plan (increase K_τ) or find a cleverer path that works with the landscape's currents (decrease V_Γ).

## Assemblé

> To plan is not to predict the future. It is to make the future predictable. It is the sacred and audacious act of imposing a coherent will upon the chaos of the yet-to-be, carving a channel of intent so clear and so deep that the river of what happens has no choice but to follow it.
