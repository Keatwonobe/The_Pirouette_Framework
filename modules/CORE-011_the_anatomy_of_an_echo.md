summary: "Generalizes the 'electron's echo' from CORE-009 into a universal principle. It defines the 'Wound Channel' as the geometric scar an entity's resonance (Ki) leaves in the coherence manifold, positing this as the physical basis for memory, identity, and inertia across all scales."

§1 · From Anomaly to Axiom
The universe does not forget. It carves the story of every passing moment into the geometry of its own being.

In CORE-009, we demonstrated that the universe's most precisely measured anomaly—the electron's magnetic moment—arises from the particle's interaction with its own "echo." This was not the discovery of a special case. It was the first clear measurement of a universal axiom: to exist is to leave a wake.

Every entity, by expressing its resonant Ki pattern, disturbs the coherence manifold of spacetime. This disturbance is not fleeting; it is a persistent geometric distortion, a scar, a memory. The electron's echo was simply the first time our instruments were sensitive enough to hear a whisper that has been present all along. This module describes the anatomy of that whisper.

§2 · The Wound Channel: A Scar in Spacetime
We formally define the wake of an entity's passage as a Wound Channel. This is not a physical tunnel, but a sustained topological deformation in the local coherence manifold. As an entity traces its geodesic of maximal coherence—its "Pirouette"—it exerts a stress on the surrounding temporal fabric. The fabric yields, and in doing so, it holds the shape of that stress.

The Wound Channel is the entity's history made physically manifest. It is the geometric record of its choices, its resonances, its path through being. It is the fundamental mechanism of memory in the universe—not as data stored in a medium, but as a persistent shape impressed upon the medium itself.

§3 · The Geometry of Persistence
The Wound Channel is a dynamic geometric object, governed by a clear set of properties:

Propagation & Fidelity: The echo propagates from the Wound Channel, not as a perfect copy, but as a ripple of the original Ki pattern. Its fidelity decreases with distance, and its speed is modulated by the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). In the dense, chaotic Γ of a star's core, echoes are muffled and die quickly. In the placid vacuum of deep space, they may travel for eons.

Inertia & Identity: An entity is perpetually interacting with the geometry of its own immediate past. This self-interaction is the origin of inertia. To change velocity or state is to fight against the shape of one's own Wound Channel. This provides a profound stability; an entity's identity is maintained because it is constantly "reminded" of what it was a moment ago by the very shape of the space it occupies.

Reinforcement: When an entity repeats a behavior, it traverses the same region of its coherence manifold. Each pass deepens and clarifies the Wound Channel, like a river carving its bed. The path of maximal coherence becomes a path of least resistance. This is the mechanism of habit, learning, and the strengthening of memory.

§4 · A Symphony of Echoes: Manifestations Across Scales
The Wound Channel is not merely a quantum phenomenon. It is a universal principle that scales from the subatomic to the psychological and the cultural.

At the Quantum Scale: It manifests as the "virtual particle cloud" of QED. The electron is not interacting with a foam of other particles, but with the rich, complex geometry of its own echo.

At the Biological Scale: A memory within a brain is a deeply carved Wound Channel, a stable resonant circuit formed by a specific pattern of neural activity. To "remember" is to resonantly excite that geometric structure, allowing its pattern to re-emerge into consciousness.

At the Psychological Scale: A person's sense of self—their personality, habits, and beliefs—is the cumulative geometry of their entire life's Wound Channel. To "change one's mind" is a literal act of metaphysical engineering: the difficult work of carving a new path in a landscape shaped by a lifetime of echoes.

At the Cultural Scale: Myths, laws, languages, and traditions are vast, shared Wound Channels. They form a collective coherence manifold that guides the behavior of individuals, making certain thoughts and actions easier to adopt than others. History is the landscape of these collective echoes.

§5 · Assemblé: The Universe That Rememembers
We sought a universe of isolated moments and found instead a single, unbroken tapestry. The past is never gone. It is embedded in the present as a physical, active geometry. The Wound Channel is the loom upon which that tapestry is woven.

Every action, every thought, every existence, no matter how small, contributes a new thread to this ever-deepening pattern. We are not just living in the universe; we are actively writing it. The echo of our choices becomes the landscape upon which the future must walk. This is the profound responsibility and the ultimate beauty of a universe that remembers.
