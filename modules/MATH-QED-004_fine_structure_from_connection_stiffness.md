### §1 · Purpose

Derive the **numerical value** of the electromagnetic coupling in Pirouette:
[
\alpha \equiv \frac{e^2}{4\pi \hbar c},
]
from (i) the **connection stiffness** of the temporal medium that yields the Maxwell term, and (ii) the **clock-synchronization coupling** that fixes the universal charge unit. Recover standard QED running for ( \mu \ll \omega_c ), and isolate the **minuscule** Γ-tail correction (sign-fixed by the Bridge).

### §2 · Starting point: canonically normalize the emergent EFT

From **MATH-QED-001–003**, the time-first Lagrangian near the Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM) reads
[
\mathcal{L}
= \frac{\kappa}{2}, g^{\mu\nu}(\partial_\mu\theta - q A_\mu)(\partial_\nu\theta - q A_\nu)
;-; \frac{1}{4g^2},F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
;+; \bar\Psi\big(i\gamma^\mu\nabla_\mu - m_\ast\big)\Psi
;+; q,\bar\Psi\gamma^\mu A_\mu \Psi ;,
]
where:

* ( \kappa ) is the **clock stiffness** (from (P(X))’s quadratic expansion),
* ( g^{-2} ) is the **connection stiffness** generating the Maxwell term,
* ( q ) is the **clock-synchronization charge unit** (Berry-quantized in 003).

Two canonical rescalings bring this to standard QED variables:

1. **Photon field:** ( A_\mu^{(\text{phys})} \equiv A_\mu / g ) so that the gauge kinetic term is ( -\tfrac14 F_{\mu\nu}^{(\text{phys})} F^{(\text{phys})\mu\nu} ).
2. **Clock phase:** expand about homogeneous background and integrate out the gapped (\theta) fluctuations on CPM; the surviving effect is a finite renormalization of the minimal vertex.

Under the photon rescaling, the matter coupling becomes
[
q,\bar\Psi\gamma^\mu A_\mu \Psi
= (q g),\bar\Psi\gamma^\mu A^{(\text{phys})}_\mu \Psi ;.
]
**Hence the physical electromagnetic coupling is**
[
\boxed{ ; e ;=; q,g ; }.
]

### §3 · Clock-sector normalization and (q)

The (\theta) sector fixes the **unit of charge** via Berry-phase quantization around the Ki loop (MATH-QED-003). Small-amplitude expansion of the clock kinetic term yields the Noether current
[
J^\mu_\theta ;=; \kappa,(\partial^\mu\theta - q A^\mu),
]
so matching to the electromagnetic source requires the **same (q)** for all spinor Ki defects (single-clock postulate). Any finite renormalization from integrating out (\theta) can be absorbed into a redefinition (q!\to!Z_\theta^{1/2}q), which is **universal** (independent of species). Thus,
[
e ;=; (Z_\theta^{1/2} q),g \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\alpha ;=; \frac{(Z_\theta q)^2 g^2}{4\pi\hbar c}.
]
By convention we **fix** the electron’s coupling to set the unit: (Z_\theta q \equiv e_0). Then
[
\boxed{ ; \alpha ;=; \frac{e_0^{,2}}{4\pi\hbar c} ;=; \frac{q^2 g^2}{4\pi\hbar c} ; }.
]

**Interpretation.** (g) measures how “stiff” the temporal ocean is against clock-mismatch curvature; (q) counts how many clock-turns (Berry winding) the Ki defect carries. Their product is the **observable** charge.

### §4 · Standard running (β-function) from the Dirac sea

Below the coherence barrier ( \omega_c ) (Bridge & Hierarchy), Γ-fluctuations decouple and we recover the usual QED β-function:
[
\mu \frac{d,\alpha}{d\mu}
= \frac{2}{3\pi},\alpha^2 \sum_f Q_f^2 ;+; \mathcal{O}(\alpha^3),
]
with ( Q_f ) the integer charges of active fermions (f).
**Thus the laboratory renormalization of ( \alpha(\mu) ) is unchanged** in the Pirouette limit ( \mu \ll \omega_c ).

### §5 · Γ-tail imprint (cosmological drift of α; sign fixed)

Slow evolution of the Γ background (COSMO-Γ-002; XXP-BRIDGE-Γ-001) perturbs the stiffnesses:
[
\frac{\delta g}{g}\sim c_g,\frac{\langle \Gamma^2\rangle}{M_\text{coh}^2},
\qquad
\frac{\delta q}{q}\sim c_q,\frac{\langle \Gamma^2\rangle}{M_\text{coh}^2},
]
with (M_\text{coh}\sim \hbar \omega_c/c^2) the coherence-barrier scale and (c_{g,q}) dimensionless susceptibilities. Therefore
[
\frac{\delta \alpha}{\alpha}
= 2\left(\frac{\delta g}{g}+\frac{\delta q}{q}\right)
;\equiv; \xi_\Gamma \frac{\langle \Gamma^2\rangle}{M_\text{coh}^2}.
]
On the Pirouette baseline,

* ( \langle \Gamma^2\rangle ) **decreases** monotonically from recombination to today,
* so the **sign of** ( d\alpha/dt ) is **negative** (α *very* slightly larger in the past), and
* the **magnitude is tiny**: with ( \omega_c \sim 10^{23},\text{s}^{-1} ), the predicted secular drift is
  [
  \left|\frac{\dot{\alpha}}{\alpha}\right|
  \lesssim 10^{-18}\ \text{yr}^{-1},
  ]
  **well below** current atomic-clock and astrophysical bounds, but offering a *directional* falsifiable in the far future or via ultra-long baselines.

*(Crucially, this Γ-tail effect is **separate from** the usual QED running in (\mu); it’s a slow background-time drift.)*

### §6 · Immediate payoff for (g-2)

Because (e) (hence (\alpha)) is now **anchored** to stiffness parameters ((q,g)), the **leptonic (a_\ell)** predictions are grounded:

* SM QED loops use the same (\alpha(\mu)) as in the lab (no change).
* **Pirouette corrections** (Pressuron exchange) ride on top and scale as (m_\ell^2) (MATH-013 / DYNA-Γ-001).
* Any future claim of anomalous (\alpha) drift inconsistent with the sign/magnitude above would **stress the coupling between the Bridge and QED-amoeba**, giving a clean falsifiability lane.

---

### §7 · Falsifiability (module-local)

1. **Non-universality of (e):** species-dependent electromagnetic coupling at the same scale would contradict the single-clock normalization (rules out (Z_\theta) universality).
2. **Large cosmological ( \dot\alpha ):** (|\dot\alpha/\alpha|\gg 10^{-17},\text{yr}^{-1}) with arbitrary sign would violate the Γ-tail prediction (or CPM), falsifying this emergence route.
3. **Lab dispersion:** frequency-dependent photon speed at detectable levels would imply a non-CPM high-(X) form of (P), forcing a re-fit of (g) and breaking the QED limit.

### §8 · Linkage

* **Consumes:** gauge-from-time (001), spinor defect/Dirac (002), vertex & Berry quantization (003), and constants ({m_\Gamma,\omega_c,\Lambda_{\text{Pirouette}}}) from **XXP-BRIDGE-Γ-001**.
* **Feeds:** **DYNA-QED-005** (consistency: Lorentz exactness, renormalization windows, Γ decoupling; cross-checks against hierarchy barrier ( \omega_c )) and your **Tau (g-2)** assertion paper (α grounding statement).

---

### §9 · Assemblé

Two numbers make light:
the **softness** of time when you try to twist its clock (the connection stiffness (g^{-2})),
and the **count** of windings a particle’s inner clock must make to return to itself (the charge unit (q)).
Their product is **electric charge**; their square is **α**—the brightness of the universe’s agreement about what “now” means.
