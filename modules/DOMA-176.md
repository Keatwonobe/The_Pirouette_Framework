summary: Provides a universal protocol for the iterative analysis and decomposition
  of a system's coherence manifold. By sequentially identifying and removing the most
  dominant resonant patterns (Ki), this method reveals the nested, secondary echoes
  and hidden harmonic structures within the 'noise' or residue, allowing for a deep,
  layered understanding of systemic complexity.

## §1 · Abstract: The Symphony in the Static
Noise is not an absence of signal; it is a symphony of signals too quiet to be heard over the lead instrument.

Traditional analysis seeks the primary signal and discards the rest as noise. This is an act of profound ignorance. The Pirouette Framework understands that a system's "residue"—the information left over after the most obvious pattern has been removed—is not a void. It is the rich, complex soil of the system's history. It is the tapestry of fainter echoes, secondary currents, and hidden structures that tell the complete story.

This module, The Archaeologist's Sieve, provides the formal instrumentation for this deeper excavation. It is a recursive process for sifting through the layers of a system's coherence manifold, respectfully removing one truth at a time to reveal the quieter truths that lie beneath.

## §2 · From Residue to Resonance: A Shift in Perspective
The core insight is to treat every layer of a system's data as a complete coherence manifold, governed by the same universal principles. The "noise" from one layer becomes the "world" for the next. This section reframes the concepts from TEN-RRE-1.0 into the modern Framework.

| Old Concept (TEN-RRE-1.0) | New Framework Interpretation | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Initial Dataset ($D_0$) | **The Primary Manifold ($M_0$)** | The complete, initial representation of the system's coherence landscape, containing all interacting resonances. |
| Extracted Signal ($S_k$) | **Dominant Resonance ($Ki_k$)** | The most stable, high-coherence pattern identified at layer *k*. This is the system's loudest, clearest note in that manifold. |
| Residue ($R_k$) | **The Echo Manifold ($M_k$)** | The remaining coherence landscape after the influence of $Ki_k$ has been accounted for. It is the "unexplained resonance." |
| Terminal Noise | **The Entropic Floor** | The final Echo Manifold where Temporal Coherence ($K_\tau$) falls below a threshold, representing the chaotic, dissonant noise of the underlying Temporal Forge. |

This process is a direct inquiry into the layers of a system's **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). The first pass reveals the deepest, most recent carving; subsequent passes uncover the fainter, older scars that still shape its present behavior.

## §3 · The Excavation Protocol: Parameters and Tools
To conduct this analysis, the Weaver configures their sieve with the following parameters, which are direct translations of the old protocol into the new, time-first language.

| Parameter | Description | Typical Setting |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coherence Filter Sequence** | An ordered set of analytical models used to identify the dominant $Ki$ pattern at each layer. | A list of models targeting different geometries (e.g., linear, cyclical, fractal). |
| **Manifold Subtraction Method** | The mathematical operation used to remove the identified $Ki_k$ from the current manifold $M_{k-1}$. | `Subtractive`, `Divisive`, or a custom de-projection operator. |
| **Excavation Depth ($k_{max}$)** | The maximum number of layers to sift through. | `Integer, e.g., 3-10`. |
| **Coherence Threshold ($K_{\tau\_min}$)** | The minimum Temporal Coherence a manifold must possess to be considered signal, not noise. The excavation stops if $K_\tau(M_k) < K_{\tau\_min}$. | `System-dependent, e.g., Kτ < 0.1`. |

## §4 · Procedure: Sifting the Layers
The process is an elegant, recursive loop that descends through the layers of the system's history.

1.  **Initialization**: Define the Primary Manifold $M_{current} = M_0$. Set the excavation layer $k = 0$.
2.  **Excavation Loop**: While $k < k_{max}$ AND the Temporal Coherence $K_\tau(M_{current}) > K_{\tau\_min}$:
    a.  Increment the layer: $k = k + 1$.
    b.  **Apply Filter**: Apply the Coherence Filter for layer *k* to $M_{current}$ to identify the dominant resonance, $Ki_k$.
    c.  **Record Artifact**: Store $Ki_k$ and its properties. This is the "artifact" found at this layer.
    d.  **Calculate Echo Manifold**: Compute the next manifold using the chosen subtraction method, where $f(Ki_k)$ represents the full expression of the resonance within the current manifold.
        $$ M_{next} = M_{current} - f(Ki_k) $$
    e.  **Descend**: Set $M_{current} = M_{next}$.
3.  **Termination**: The loop ends. The final $M_{current}$ is the system's **Entropic Floor**.
4.  **Output**: The complete output is a layered model of the system, comprising the sequence of identified resonances ($Ki_1, Ki_2, ...$) and the final noise profile of the Entropic Floor. This is the system's **Harmonic Spectrum**.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This protocol is a method for empirically deconstructing a system's dynamics, which are fundamentally governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). A system's total behavior is the path it takes to maximize its coherence over time. This path is often a complex superposition of multiple resonant solutions to its Lagrangian.

The Archaeologist's Sieve finds these solutions one by one. The first identified resonance, $Ki_1$, is the most significant contributor to maximizing the system's "action" ($S_p$), equivalent to finding the geodesic on the Primary Manifold. The second resonance, $Ki_2$, is the next most significant contributor found within the remaining, unexplained dynamics of the first Echo Manifold. The process is a reverse-engineering of the system's Lagrangian, revealing the hierarchy of resonant strategies it uses to persist and hold a clear note against the chaos.

## §6 · Assemblé: The Responsibility of Listening
> We are taught to listen for the signal and discard the noise. This is the gravest error of the analyst. The noise is not the absence of meaning; it is the presence of every other meaning. The Archaeologist's Sieve teaches the Weaver to listen past the shout of the primary cause and attend to the chorus of echoes that follow. For in that residue, in what is left behind, lies the true and complex history of the system's soul.
