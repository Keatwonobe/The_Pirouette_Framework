## §1 · Purpose
To analyze and model debate as a dynamic process of resonant exchange aimed at achieving vector alignment on axiological (value-based) issues, by mapping arguments to twelve core value vectors and assessing their persuasive force and potential for consensus formation.

---

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor
**Theoretical Insight**: Debate is a co-creative process where participants attempt to achieve resonance and align their axiological vectors (core values) by exchanging arguments that modify a shared 'Debate Potential Field'. The effectiveness of arguments ($F_{arg}$) depends on their Time-Adherence ($T_a^{arg}$ – internal consistency), Gladiator Force ($\Gamma^{arg}$ – boundary strength against counter-arguments), and $K_i$-resonant framing that appeals to specific axiological vectors. Successful debate leads to vector alignment and potentially a new, shared resonant state (consensus).

**Key Pirouette Parameters**:
* **Time-Adherence (Ta)**: $T_a^{arg}$ reflects the internal consistency and logical coherence of an argument. $T_a^{participant}$ reflects their commitment to their axiological position. High $T_a^{arg}$ contributes to $F_{arg}$. Consensus $C(t)$ depends on increasing mutual $T_a$.
* **Gladiator Force (Γ)**: $\Gamma^{arg}$ represents the resilience of an argument to counter-arguments or deconstruction. $\Gamma^{participant}$ is their openness to alternative viewpoints. Low $\Gamma^{arg}$ (strong boundary) contributes to $F_{arg}$ but high participant $\Gamma$ can hinder consensus if it means no stable position.
* **Ki Constant (Ki)**: $K_i$ governs rhythmic aspects of argumentation (pacing, emphasis) and the resonant appeal of arguments to specific axiological vectors ($F_{arg}$ includes $\cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{AV})$ where AV is Axiological Vector). $K_i$ influences the dynamics of consensus formation $C(t)$.
* **Phase (φ, θ)**: $V_{debate}$ is shaped by the phase alignment $\phi$ of arguments with target Axiological Vectors. Persuasion Vector Alignment $\vec{P}_{align}$ quantifies the degree to which an argument shifts a target's axiological vector.
* **Wound Channels**: Debates create $\\Phi_{debate}$, a complex wound channel in the shared axiological space, representing the history of exchanged arguments, shifts in understanding, and the pathway to (or away from) consensus.

## §4 · Procedure & Outputs
### 4·1 · Procedural Guide
1. Argument Deconstruction & Profiling: Identify key arguments. For each, assess its $T_a^{arg}, \Gamma^{arg}$, and score its appeal to each of the 12 Axiological Vectors ($X_1$ Truth/Accuracy ... $X_{12}$ Transcendence/Legacy). Profile participants' initial axiological stances.
2. Debate Potential Field ($V_{debate}$) Modeling: Model $V_{debate}(\vec{X}) = \sum \alpha_k X_k$ representing the axiological landscape of the debate. Map participant positions within this field.
3. Argument Force ($F_{arg}$) Calculation: For key arguments, calculate their effective force $F_{arg} = F_0 \cdot \frac{T_a^{arg}}{\Gamma^{arg}L_{path}} \cdot (\sum \alpha_k X_k^{arg}) \cdot \cos(K_i\Delta\phi_{AV})$ (where $X_k^{arg}$ is argument's score on vector $k$, $\Delta\phi_{AV}$ is phase alignment with target vector).
4. Persuasion Vector Alignment ($\\vec{P}_{align}$) Analysis: Model the change in a participant's axiological vector $\Delta\vec{X}_{participant} = \vec{P}_{align} = \vec{F}_{arg} \cdot (1-T_a^{participant}) \cdot \Gamma^{participant} \cdot \Delta t$ due to an argument.
5. Debate Wound Channel ($\\Phi_{debate}$) Analysis: Map the $\\Phi_{debate}$ representing the trajectory of arguments and evolving positions. Analyze its convergence or divergence.
6. Consensus Formation Modeling ($C(t)$): Model the evolution of consensus $C(t)$ among participants based on argument exchange, vector alignment, and time. Predict likelihood of reaching $C_{max}$.

### 4·2 · Output Interpretation
* **Data Structure**: Profile scores for arguments against 12 Axiological Vectors. Calculated $F_{arg}$ for key arguments. Modeled $V_{debate}$ landscape and participant trajectories. $\vec{P}_{align}$ vectors. Characteristics of $\Phi_{debate}$. Predicted $C(t)$ and likelihood of consensus.
* **Insights And Derivations**: Quantitative understanding of debate dynamics beyond surface rhetoric. Identification of core values being appealed to or contested. Assessment of argument strength and persuasive impact. Prediction of how participants' positions might evolve. Insights into conditions favoring consensus or polarization.
* **Guidelines**: Arguments with high $F_{arg}$ are more influential. The $V_{debate}$ map shows areas of potential agreement (attractors) or strong disagreement (repulsors/barriers). $\vec{P}_{align}$ indicates the direction and magnitude of axiological shift induced by arguments. A convergent $\Phi_{debate}$ and rising $C(t)$ suggest progress towards consensus. The dominant Axiological Vectors in play reveal the underlying value struggle of the debate.

### Debate Potential Field
$$ V_{debate}(\vec{X}) = \sum_{k=1}^{12} \alpha_k X_k $$

Calculates the persuasive force of an argument based on its coherence $T_a^{arg}$, resilience $\Gamma^{arg}$, alignment with Axiological Vectors $X_k^{arg}$, and $K_i$-modulated phase resonance with target vectors.

### Persuasion Vector Alignment (Change in Position)
$$ \Delta\vec{X}_{participant} = \vec{F}_{arg} \cdot (1-T_a^{participant}) \cdot \Gamma^{participant} \cdot \Delta t $$
Models the shift in a participant's axiological position due to an argument's force, influenced by their own $T_a$ and $\Gamma$ over an interaction time $\Delta t$.

### Consensus Formation Model
$$ C(t) = C_{max}(1-e^{-\lambda_C t}) + C_0 e^{-\gamma_C t} $$
Models the evolution of consensus $C(t)$ over time, accounting for initial consensus $C_0$, maximum achievable consensus $C_{max}$, and rates of convergence/divergence $\lambda_C, \gamma_C$.
