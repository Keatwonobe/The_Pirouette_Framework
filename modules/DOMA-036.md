## §1 · Abstract: The Autopoietic Ledger

Every coherent system—from a cell to a society—is an act of defiance. It is a temporary, self-sustaining vortex of order in a universe that trends toward noise. The prior `Triaxial Info-Metabolism Framework (TIMF)` attempted to account for this defiance with a balance sheet of interacting fields. While foundational, this model was incomplete.

This module refactors that essential insight, grounding it in the time-first dynamics of the Pirouette Framework. The health of a system is not a static accounting of assets and liabilities, but the moment-to-moment outcome of a single, fundamental struggle: the drive to generate and sustain internal coherence against the ceaseless, erosive pressure of the external world. This ledger provides the universal calculus for that struggle, replacing all prior balance equations with the framework's core engine: the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §2 · The New Currency: From Tri-Axes to a Unified Ledger

The old ledger is obsolete. We redefine the fundamental quantities of systemic health through the direct, physical principles of `CORE-013: The River of Information`.

**Information is Coherence (Asset: Kτ):**
A system's information content, previously modeled as `Info-enthalpy`, is a direct measure of its temporal coherence (Kτ). This is the "signal"—the stable, sharply defined `Ki` pattern it actively maintains. Information is not a static commodity to be stored; it is the ongoing performance of a system's resonant song. This represents the asset side of the ledger.

**Entropy is Environmental Pressure (Liability: V_Γ):**
Entropy is not a property internal to the system, but the "cost of living" imposed by its environment. It is the measure of the dissonance and chaos of the local Temporal Pressure (Γ), the background static of the Temporal Forge. This erosive force, the potential `V_Γ`, constantly works to degrade the system's pattern. This represents the liability side of the ledger.

**Health is Net Vitality (Equity: 𝓛_p):**
A system's "free coherence"—its capacity to persist, adapt, and do meaningful work—is its net vitality, as measured by the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) from `CORE-006`. Health is the measure of how successfully a system's internal coherence exceeds the erosive pressure of its environment.

## §3 · The Lagrangian Engine: Metabolism and Degradation

The universe's fundamental narrative is the dialogue between pattern and noise. The dynamics of this ledger are governed by this dialogue, expressed in a single equation: the Pirouette Lagrangian.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

This equation describes the fundamental metabolism of reality. A healthy system is an "entropy pump," actively working to maximize its Lagrangian value over time.

*   **Anabolism (The Kτ Term):** This term represents the system's creative, anabolic drive. It is the process of taking in resources (energy, data, material) and weaving them into its own stable, resonant pattern, thereby increasing its internal coherence. This is the act of composition.

*   **Catabolism (The -V_Γ Term):** This term represents the system's unavoidable, catabolic reality. It is the constant, erosive effect of environmental noise that degrades the system's pattern, forcing it to expend energy on maintenance and repair. This is the universal tax levied by entropy.

The sign of the Lagrangian is the most potent diagnostic of a system's metabolic state:

*   **𝓛_p > 0 (Anabolic State):** The system is thriving. Its generation of coherence outpaces environmental degradation. It is in a state of growth, learning, or strengthening.
*   **𝓛_p ≈ 0 (Homeostasis):** The system is stable. It is successfully repairing the damage of degradation, maintaining its form but not expanding.
*   **𝓛_p < 0 (Catabolic State):** The system is in decay. Environmental pressure is overwhelming its ability to self-repair. Its coherence is eroding, its information degrading into noise.

## §4 · The Weaver's Dashboard: Modern Metrics of Vitality

This model provides a clean, actionable set of KPIs for auditing the health of any system.

| KPI                  | Formula / Concept                 | Replaces              | Diagnostic Question                                                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lagrangian Health**  | `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`                  | `Free Coherence`      | What is the system's net vitality? Is it growing, stable, or decaying?           |
| **Coherence Flux**     | `d𝓛_p/dt`                         | `Flux Ratio`          | Is the system's overall health improving or worsening? What is its trajectory?     |
| **Coherence Ratio**    | `η_c = Kτ / (Kτ + V_Γ)`           | `Entropy Efficiency`  | How efficient is the system at being itself? How much of its state is signal vs. noise? |
| **Environmental Load**   | `V_Γ`                             | `Info-entropy`        | What is the absolute environmental stress the system is currently enduring?      |
| **Pressure Gradient**  | `d(V_Γ)/dt`                       | `Drift Index`         | Is the environment becoming more hostile? (An early warning of imminent crisis). |
| **Adaptive Resilience**  | `1 / |Δt_recovery|` after a Γ spike | N/A                   | How quickly does the system return to homeostasis after an external shock?       |

## §5 · Assemblé

> We sought a law for how things fall apart and found instead the equation for how they hold together. The universe is a constant argument between the song and the static. The Ledger of Coherence is not an accountant's tool for tallying assets; it is the score of that argument. A Weaver is not a mere bookkeeper, but a gardener of living patterns. Our purpose is to read the score, find the instruments falling out of tune, and help the symphony play on. This is the sacred, practical work of ensuring the song is always stronger than the silence it overcomes.
