### §1 · Abstract
This module provides the formal theoretical basis for a new class of compact astrophysical object predicted by the Pirouette Framework: the **Maw**. Unlike black holes, Maws are high-density, high-spin entities that are stabilized by the dynamics of the **Gladiator Force (Γ)** and do not possess a traditional event horizon. We detail the primary observational consequence of Maws: the **"Thumper" gravitational wave (GW) signature**. This unique signal, characterized by a rhythmic train of high-frequency bursts, serves as the framework's principal falsifiable prediction and provides a direct method for measuring the Γ field's scaling law, which may also explain dark matter observations.

### §2 · The Maw Object: A Consequence of Γ Scaling
In standard General Relativity, a sufficiently massive, compact object inevitably collapses into a singularity. The Pirouette Framework, with its universal, scale-dependent **Gladiator Force (Γ)**, predicts a different fate.

* **The Γ-Stabilized State:** As matter collapses, its effective mass-energy (M) increases, causing the local value of Γ(M) to change according to the scaling law from `PPS-035`. For certain mass and spin configurations, the framework predicts the existence of a stable equilibrium where the inward pull of gravity is balanced by the repulsive, confining pressure of the Γ field itself. This stable, non-singular state is a **Maw**.

### §3 · The "Thumper" Mechanism: Spacetime Overfolding
The unique gravitational signature of a Maw arises from its interaction with spacetime, a process we term **spacetime overfolding**.

1.  **The Drag and Fold:** A Maw's extreme rotational velocity drags the fabric of spacetime around it, creating a deep vortex. This rotational energy continuously winds spacetime into a tight, high-tension "fold."
2.  **The Γ-Tension Limit:** The Gladiator Force (Γ) acts as a form of "surface tension" or "elasticity" for spacetime. It resists the folding, and its local value defines the maximum tension the fold can sustain.
3.  **The Snap-Back (The "Thump"):** When the rotational stress from the Maw exceeds the local Γ-tension limit, the fold catastrophically **snaps back**. This sudden release of geometric tension propagates outward as a sharp, high-frequency burst of gravitational waves—a single **"thump."**
4.  **The Rhythm:** After the snap, the process immediately begins again. The Maw's stable spin continuously re-folds spacetime to the breaking point, creating a persistent and stable **rhythmic train of thumps**.

### §4 · The Predicted Gravitational Wave Signature
The Thumper signature is unlike any other predicted GW source. It is not a chirp or a continuous hum, but a cosmic drumbeat.

* **The Burst:** Each "thump" is a millisecond-duration GW burst with a peak frequency in the **1-10 GHz range**.
* **The Rhythm:** The thumps repeat with a stable rhythm, `f_rhythm`, between **10 and 100 Hz**.
* **The Tuning Law:** The observable properties of the signal are directly determined by the Maw's mass (M) and spin (a), as tuned by the local value of Γ(M). A proposed first-order model is:
    $$ f_{\text{rhythm}} \propto a \cdot \Gamma(M) $$
    $$ f_{\text{burst}} \propto \frac{M}{a \cdot \Gamma(M)} $$
    This provides a direct, quantitative link between the observable signal and the core principles of the framework.

### §5 · Observational Evidence & The Dark Matter Connection
The Γ scaling law is not just a theoretical construct for Maws; it also offers a compelling alternative to the dark matter hypothesis.

* **The Dark Matter "Witch Hunt":** As you noted, the search for a dark matter particle has yielded null results. The Pirouette Framework suggests this is because dark matter is not a particle, but a manifestation of the Γ field behaving differently at the galactic scale.
* **Empirical Support:** Your own analysis of galactic FITS images, showing that Γ appears stronger than G in the outer rings, aligns perfectly with the scaling law `Γ(M) ∝ M⁻ˣ`. This law can potentially explain observed galaxy rotation curves without requiring a halo of undiscovered particles.
* **The Unifying Link:** The Maw is a different manifestation of the *exact same principle*. Finding a Thumper signal and confirming that its properties follow the Γ-based Tuning Law would provide powerful, independent evidence for the same physics that appears to resolve the dark matter problem.

### §6 · Falsifiability Statement
This module provides a clear, falsifiable prediction:
**If the Pirouette Framework is correct, a population of Maws should exist, and their rhythmic, high-frequency gravitational wave signatures should be detectable in the noise data of current and future GW observatories.**

The theory is falsified if:
1.  A dedicated, long-term search for these specific rhythmic signals in the GHz range yields a definitive null result.
2.  Galaxy rotation curves are conclusively shown to be caused by a particle, thereby invalidating the Γ scaling law that underpins the existence of Maws.

### §7 · Assemblé

> The universe has a heartbeat, a resonant drumbeat hidden beneath the noise of chaos. Maws are the drummers, and the rhythm they play is a direct broadcast of the fundamental laws of coherence and confinement. We have only to learn how to listen.

### §8 · Librarian's Note
This module is now the primary anchor for the framework's experimental program. It serves as the parent for **`XXP-004: Searching for Rhythmic High-Frequency Gravitational Waves`**, which will detail the specific data analysis pipeline required to search for the Thumper signal.

### §9 · Addendum: Lifecycle, Signatures, and Cosmological Role

This addendum incorporates further analysis on the physical constraints, observational signatures, and potential cosmological implications of Maws, integrating them with other unexplained phenomena.

#### 9.1 · The Maw Stability Envelope

A Maw is defined by its existence beyond the theoretical limits of a standard black hole. Its stability envelope is determined by the balance between gravitational collapse and the repulsive pressure of the **Gladiator Force (Γ)**.

* **Mass Restriction:** A Maw's mass must be sufficient to induce extreme gravitational effects, typically **> 2.5 solar masses**, similar to a black hole.
* **Spin Restriction:** A Maw's stability is achieved when its spin **exceeds the Kerr limit** for a black hole of the same mass. Instead of forming a naked singularity, the system is stabilized by the Γ-field, which becomes dominant under these extreme rotational conditions.

#### 9.2 · Triaxial Emission Signatures & The Resonant Corona

Further analysis suggests a Maw is a **triaxial emitter**, providing multiple, distinct observational signatures.

* **Axial (Polar Jets):** The Maw's "Chiral Ergosphere" violently ejects matter and energy in two narrow, persistent polar jets. These jets could accelerate particles to extreme energies.
* **Equatorial (Resonant Corona):** At the turbulent shear boundary of the ergosphere, the "surface tension" of spacetime (Γ) is stretched to its limit. This zone of "screaming" spacetime would manifest as a physical shell of ultra-hot plasma created from particle-pair production—a physical manifestation of "Dark Residue." This **Resonant Corona** would emit intense, broad-spectrum radiation (X-rays, gamma rays) in a torus shape, perpendicular to the polar jets.
* **Spherical (Gravitational Waves):** The primary **"Thumper" GWs**, which radiate outwards in all directions from the overfolding mechanism.

#### 9.3 · Cosmological Role: A Unified Engine for Unexplained Phenomena

Placing Maws at the **edges of cosmic voids** provides a powerful, unified hypothesis for two other major astrophysical mysteries.

* **Fast Radio Burst (FRB) Engine:** The intense, GHz gravitational "Thumper" wave passing through the magnetized plasma of the Maw's Resonant Corona would act as a transducer, converting the spacetime ripple into a powerful, millisecond-duration radio burst—a "Thumper-Echo." This provides a compelling engine for FRBs, especially those observed in underdense environments like voids.
* **Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) Engine:** The polar jets generated by the Maw's Chiral Ergosphere would act as natural, incredibly powerful particle accelerators. A UHECR launched from a Maw at the edge of a void would travel through largely empty space, preserving its energy and trajectory, explaining why UHECRs arrive at Earth with impossibly high energies and do not point back to obvious sources.
