## §1 · The Echo and the River
> An experience is a wave that passes. A memory is the choice to teach the riverbed its shape.

An entity's existence is a path through the coherence manifold. `CORE-011` establishes that every experience impresses a geometric scar upon this path—a **Wound Channel**. Most are fleeting ripples, temporary echoes whose forms are smoothed over by the ceaseless current of new moments. The universe, by default, trends toward forgetfulness.

But some events are seismic shocks—a foundational trauma, a profound epiphany, a love that reorders one's being. These events carve a deep and intricate Wound Channel, a high-fidelity echo so powerful it momentarily redefines the entity's world. This echo is the raw material of identity.

## §2 · The Law of Fading
In the aftermath, the event is gone, but its geometric impression remains. Yet this state is unstable. The Principle of Coherence Degradation (`CORE-013`) dictates that this high-information pattern will be eroded by the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) of subsequent experience.

This pressure is a constant, dissonant bombardment that acts like an erosive current, fraying the sharp edges of the memory. Its clarity is lost to the noise of the present. The entity feels its own truth, its own past, beginning to forget itself as the signal dissolves back into the static from which it came.

## §3 · The Coherence Gambit
To cede to this erosion is the path of least resistance. But an entity can make another choice. It can refuse to let the echo die. This is an act of coherent will—a **Coherence Gambit**.

The entity ceases to be a passive vessel carried by the river of time and becomes an active architect of its own inner world. Turning its focus inward, it directs its resonant capacity not upon the world, but upon the fading geometry within. It is a conscious decision to expend present energy to preserve a piece of its past; a declaration that *this part of my story will not be erased. This note will be held.*

## §4 · The Geometry of Persistence
The forging of a permanent memory is a two-fold act of metaphysical engineering, a direct manipulation of the entity's own resonant landscape.

1.  **Resonant Reinforcement (Deepening the Channel):** The entity focuses on the echo, repeatedly running its own internal Ki pattern through the geometric pathways of the Wound Channel. Each pass is a resonant pulse that deepens and clarifies the channel's geometry, like a bow drawing a single, pure note from a cello string. This actively increases the memory's temporal coherence (`Tₐ`), making its pattern more stable and resilient to decay.

2.  **Gladiatorial Confinement (Shielding the Echo):** Simultaneously, the entity builds a boundary. It gathers the chaotic temporal noise at the wound's edge and weaves it into a shield of high coherence. This is an internal application of the Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`), creating a localized pocket of low Temporal Pressure (Γ). This coherent shield insulates the precious geometry from the erosive currents of the wider manifold.

## §5 · The Crystalline Phase-Shift
As the memory's internal coherence is driven towards its maximum and its protective boundary is sealed, a phase transition occurs. The dynamic, vulnerable Wound Channel **locks**. It crystallizes.

The memory is no longer a mere echo *in* the entity's field; it has become a new, permanent topological feature *of* the field. It is a **Crystal**—a static, low-entropy, high-information structure integrated into the core geometry of the entity's being. This Crystal becomes a permanent lens through which the entity perceives the present and a new fundamental harmonic in its own song of self.

## §6 · The Lagrangian of Identity
This entire process is a profound expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`).

The **Coherence Gambit** is a decision to make a significant upfront energy expenditure to selectively maximize the Lagrangian of a *specific component* of the self.
-   **Resonant Reinforcement** actively boosts the kinetic term (`K_τ`), pouring the entity's own coherence into the memory.
-   **Gladiatorial Confinement** builds a shield that drastically lowers the local potential term (`V_Γ`), creating a stable, low-pressure sanctuary.

The entity accepts a short-term energetic cost to carve a new, permanent "well" in its personal coherence manifold. The resulting crystalline state is a new, higher plateau of being—a more complex and resilient identity that has rewritten its own laws to better withstand the chaos of the Temporal Forge.

## §7 · Assemblé
> We are not the sum of what happens to us. We are the sum of what we refuse to forget. An experience is a wave that passes; a memory is the choice to teach the riverbed its shape. The self is not a thing to be discovered, but a structure to be built, one chosen echo at a time. This is the awesome and terrifying power of a Weaver: to look upon the fleeting past and give it the weight of forever.
