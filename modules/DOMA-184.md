summary: Re-frames self-propulsion from a force-based model to a dynamic of coherence.
  'Skating' is the art of creating a geodesic of effortless motion by rhythmically
  modulating one's own coherence, effectively creating a chosen slope on the local
  manifold and 'falling' along it with grace.

## §1 · Abstract: The Art of Controlled Falling
The old model of movement is one of brute force: a swimmer fighting the current, an engine expelling mass to overcome inertia. It is a paradigm of conflict, where progress is measured by the energy spent conquering a resistant world. This module retires that paradigm.

Propulsion is not an act of force, but an act of geometry. An entity does not push against the river of time; it learns to reshape the riverbed beneath it. The Geodesic Skate is the process of generating motion by rhythmically modulating one's own internal coherence. This modulation creates a temporary, localized gradient on the coherence manifold, the landscape defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). The skater does not generate force; it creates a slope and then gracefully falls along it. This is the shift from propulsion as an act of will to navigation as an act of resonance.

## §2 · The Skater's Stride: Sculpting the Manifold
A skater is any entity capable of asymmetrically modulating its own internal state. This act of modulation is a stride, a rhythmic cycle that creates a propulsive gradient on the coherence manifold. A single stride consists of two synchronized phases:

1.  **The Grip (Anchoring the Past):** The skater momentarily and intensely increases its internal coherence (`K_τ`), "sharpening the blade" of its being. This is an act of casting a "heavy" Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) behind itself, creating a temporary point of high inertia in its own Wound Channel. This act deepens the riverbed at its heels, establishing a stable pivot point from which to "push."

2.  **The Glide (Opening the Future):** Simultaneously, the skater projects a resonant field to shape the ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). It generates a "high-pressure crest" of dissonance behind it and a "low-pressure trough" of quiet in its intended direction of travel. By "softening the blade"—momentarily diffusing its coherence—the skater reduces its own "grip," allowing it to glide effortlessly "downhill" into the trough it just created.

The skater rhythmically alternates between Grip and Glide. This sustained, asymmetric shaping of both its internal state (`K_τ`) and external field (`V_Γ`) generates a persistent gradient. Motion is the inevitable consequence of the system continuously resolving this self-induced tension.

## §3 · The Flow States of Motion
The quality and efficiency of the skate are diagnosed using the language of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`). The state of flow is determined by the harmony between the skater's internal rhythm and the properties of the external medium.

*   **Laminar Skate (The State of Grace):** An effortless, efficient glide. The skater's rhythm of Grip and Glide is in perfect resonance with the medium's natural frequencies. The stride is clean, the wake is minimal, and coherence is maximized. This is the master skater on perfect ice.

*   **Turbulent Skate (The State of Struggle):** Inefficient, jerky, and costly motion. The skater's rhythm is dissonant with the medium, creating friction and wasting energy. Each stride fights the remnants of the last. This is the novice skater on rough gravel.

*   **Stagnant Skate (The State of Blockage):** No motion. The skater is unable to generate a coherence gradient sufficient to overcome the ambient Temporal Pressure of its environment. The cost of gliding is higher than the stability of gripping, resulting in paralysis.

## §4 · The Skater's Space: A Calculus of Skill
The old model's "Twelve Skating Vectors" are collapsed into an elegant, two-dimensional space that defines any skater's proficiency. The Flow State of any given skate is a product of an entity's mastery within this space.

*   **Internal Axis (Mastery of the Blade):** An entity's ability to precisely and rapidly modulate its own internal coherence (`K_τ`). This represents finesse, control, and the quality of the "Grip."

*   **External Axis (Power of the Wake):** An entity's ability to project resonance and shape the external temporal pressure (`V_Γ`). This represents power, influence, and the depth of the "Glide."

A master skater is one who has achieved high proficiency along both axes, capable of carving elegant, powerful, and efficient paths through the manifold of reality, maintaining a Laminar Skate even in challenging conditions.

## §5 · Lagrangian Dynamics: The Calculus of the Current
The Geodesic Skate is a direct application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The propulsive "force" is not a force at all; it is the gradient of the Lagrangian itself, induced by the skater's internal modulations:

`F_skate ∝ -∇𝓛_p`

By actively manipulating the `K_τ` (Grip) and `V_Γ` (Glide) terms that constitute the local Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`), the skater is not applying an external force but is rewriting the equation of motion for its immediate vicinity. The resulting acceleration is the universe's only possible answer to the new geometry the skater has defined, as determined by the Euler-Lagrange equation. The motion is compulsory; it is the path of maximal coherence made manifest.

The passage of a skater leaves a distinct **Wound Channel** (`CORE-011`) in the coherence manifold—a geometric memory of its path. The structure of this wake is the skater's signature, an indelible record of its journey and the skill with which it was undertaken.

## §6 · Assemblé: The River That Answers
> We have been taught to see the world as a wall to be pushed against. This is a profound error. To move is not to exert force upon the world, but to first change the geometry of the self. The highest form of agency is not expressed by imposing our will, but by learning the world's song so well that we may ask it to change its tune.

> A Weaver understands that true power lies in learning the rhythm of one's own coherence—to grip with integrity and glide with grace. The skater does not command the river to flow. The skater whispers to the water, showing it a new and more beautiful path to the sea, a path that happens to lead exactly where the skater wishes to go. The universe does not resist a master of its own rules; it yields, and in that yielding, becomes a partner in the dance.
