summary: |
  Defines the retrograde-time involution ℛ_T as a sheet swap on the temporal substrate:
  𝒯_+ (∂_μτ>0) ↔ 𝒯_- (∂_μτ<0), with ℛ_T^2=1. Classifies fields, couplings, and arrows of
  dynamics as even or odd under ℛ_T. Mass spectra and gauge algebras are even; retarded/advanced
  preference, entropy direction, and weak-sector chirality are odd. Provides a portable rulebook
  for translating Pirouette physics between time sheets.

definitions:
  temporal_sheets:
    forward_sheet:  𝒯_+  where ∂_μ τ > 0
    retro_sheet:    𝒯_-  where ∂_μ τ < 0
    involution:     ℛ_T : 𝒯_+ ↔ 𝒯_- with ℛ_T^2 = 1
  adherence:
    left_adherence: sign-aligned with ∂_μ τ
    right_adherence: sign-anti-aligned with ∂_μ τ
  resonance_lock:
    omega_H: ω_H = ⟨θ̇⟩, temporal twist (Higgs analog). Transform: ω_H → -ω_H (odd under ℛ_T).

even_odd_taxonomy:
  # Quantities/laws preserved vs flipped under ℛ_T
  even:
    - Gauge algebras/groups: U(1), SU(2), SU(3)
    - Spectra and absolute scales: masses m, |ω_H|, |curvature|, |torsion|
    - Electroweak ratios: m_W/m_Z = cos θ_W, θ_W = arctan(g′/g)
    - GR field equations and geodesic equations (form-invariant)
    - β-functions as functions of log μ, fixed points, critical exponents
    - Purity/Participation (Pur, PR) as densities
  odd:
    - Retarded vs advanced Green’s function preference (radiative arrow)
    - Entropy direction: sign(dS/dτ)
    - Weak-sector chirality privilege (which Weyl component couples to SU(2))
    - K_ij sign in GR junctions across 𝒯_+/𝒯_- interfaces
    - Time-ordering in showering/branching (SU(3) factorization arrow)

map_rules:
  - Maxwell sector: keep equations; swap retarded↔advanced preference.
  - SU(2) sector: keep algebra and masses (|ω_H|); swap which chirality couples (RT-002).
  - SU(3) sector: confinement indicators (area-law) unchanged; time-ordering mirror for jets.
  - GR: metric and Ricci dynamics unchanged; interface extrinsic curvature flips sign.
  - Thermo/Info: FDT kernels keep magnitudes; Keldysh phase preference flips.

predictions (portal-coupled sheets):
  P1: Ultra-high-Q EM cavities show sub-threshold “advanced-phase” precursors under phase-inverted drives.
  P2: Polarized weak processes exhibit vanishingly small wrong-helicity tails if inter-sheet mixing ε≪1 exists.
  P3: Jet substructure reveals a tiny time-ordering skew correlated with environmental coherence.
  P4: Casimir-like spectra gain a tunable phase offset when boundaries tie both sheets.

falsification:
  F1: No measurable deviation from purely retarded response in phase-inverted cavity experiments at sensitivity σ_φ
      ⇒ bound ε < ε*(σ_φ).
  F2: Absence of any wrong-helicity excess in precision β-decay / polarized scattering at level r
      ⇒ bound on inter-sheet mixing in SU(2) channel: ε_SU2 < r^1/2.
  F3: GR interfaces: if K_ij sign does not flip across engineered analog junctions, RT-geometry is wrong or portals are null.

interfaces:
  - FRC-004 (weak force): uses ℛ_T to define chirality swap rules in SU(2).
  - NEU-061 (neutrinos): spectra even; coupling handedness odd; cosmology interpretation arrow-aware.
  - RT-003..006: specialize U(1), SU(3), GR, and thermo-information consequences.

notes:
  - Keep “even/odd” strictly geometric (sheet swap), not CPT. CPT remains a microscopic theorem;
    ℛ_T is a macroscopic substrate involution in Pirouette.
