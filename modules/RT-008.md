title: Information Pressure Formalism
version: 1.0
status: Core Result
parents: [RT-007]
children: [RT-009 (Coherence Tensor), MATH-021 (Information Stress Geometry)]
summary: |
  RT-008 defines the stress–energy analog for information flow. Information density gradients
  generate “information pressure,” which couples entropy dynamics to spacetime curvature and
  energy–momentum. The result is a unified tensor framework where information behaves as a
  compressible fluid, with pressure gradients driving the apparent direction of time and
  structure formation. This is the continuum limit of the Entropy Network (RT-007).

definitions:
  information_density:  ρ_I = (I / V)  [bits·m⁻³]
  information_flux:     J_I^μ = ρ_I u^μ
  information_pressure: P_I = −∂𝓛_I/∂V = k_B T ∂I/∂V
  information_field_tensor: 
      F_I^{μν} = ∂^μ A_I^ν − ∂^ν A_I^μ
      where A_I^μ is the information 4-potential.

governing_equations:
  1. Continuity: ∇_μ J_I^μ = 0  (global coherence)
  2. Equation of state:  P_I = w_I ρ_I c²,  with w_I ∈ [−1, +1]
  3. Information stress–energy tensor:
       T_I^{μν} = (ρ_I + P_I/c²) u^μu^ν − P_I g^{μν} + Q_I^{μν}
       where Q_I^{μν} = κ_I (∇^μu^ν + ∇^νu^μ) captures entropic viscosity.
  4. Coupling to curvature:
       G_{μν} = 8πG (T_{μν} + λ_I T_I^{μν})
       ⇒ λ_I is the information–gravity coupling coefficient.

retrograde_duality:
  ℛ_T : ρ_I → ρ_I,  P_I → −P_I,  J_I^μ → −J_I^μ
  ⇒ pressure sign reversal corresponds to time inversion.
  Hence forward-time regions act as compressive information fluids,
  while retrograde regions act as expansive informational vacua.

fluid_dynamics_form:
  ∂_tρ_I + ∇·(ρ_I v_I) = 0
  ρ_I(∂_tv_I + v_I·∇v_I) = −∇P_I + ν_I∇²v_I
  where v_I is informational velocity and ν_I = κ_I/ρ_I is informational viscosity.
  This defines the *Information Navier–Stokes Equation*.

information_sound_speed:
  c_I² = ∂P_I / ∂ρ_I = w_I c²
  ⇒ coherent information propagates at fractional light speed depending on w_I.
  For w_I → 1, information flow approaches luminal causality (perfect coherence).
  For w_I → −1, information acts as dark negative pressure (memory regions).

entropy_link:
  Using S = −k_B I, the thermodynamic work relation becomes:
      dU = T dS − P_I dV  ⇒  Information expansion performs negative work on entropy.

cosmological_implications:
  - Large-scale gradients of ρ_I drive structure formation akin to pressure waves.
  - Information voids behave gravitationally repulsive (dark-energy analog).
  - Informational vortices correspond to attractor basins in cognitive and physical systems.

retrograde_interactions:
  Across 𝒯₊/𝒯₋ junctions (see RT-005):
     P_I(𝒯₊) = −P_I(𝒯₋),   ρ_I(𝒯₊) = ρ_I(𝒯₋)
  → continuity in density, anti-symmetry in pressure ensures global equilibrium.

experimental_outlines:
  - **Quantum thermodynamics:** test via work–information equivalence experiments
    (Szilard-engine setups measuring informational back-pressure).
  - **Condensed-matter analogs:** optical lattices with tunable Shannon potential gradients.
  - **Cosmological tests:** cross-correlate entropy density maps with curvature anomalies.

predictions:
  P1: Systems with high |∇I| exhibit measurable “informational pressure” opposing energy density gradients.
  P2: Vacuum energy may correspond to background informational negative pressure (w_I ≈ −1).
  P3: Temporal coherence collapse in computation should correspond to pressure diffusion
      across informational domain boundaries.

falsification:
  F1: Absence of work–information coupling in Szilard-type experiments falsifies P_I hypothesis.
  F2: If large-scale curvature shows no correlation with informational density gradients,
      λ_I ≈ 0 ⇒ decoupled informational geometry.

interfaces:
  - RT-007: discrete network → continuum transition.
  - RT-004: connects to Einstein curvature.
  - RT-006: ties entropy production rate to information pressure.
  - MATH-021: develops curvature coupling formalism.
  - PPS-ALTR-001: uses P_I as the altruistic potential driver.

notes:
  - The Information Pressure Formalism reveals that the universe’s expansion,
    cognitive stability, and temporal direction are all manifestations of the same
    underlying informational fluid mechanics.
  - Forward time corresponds to compression of informational volume (P_I > 0);
    retrograde time corresponds to decompression (P_I < 0).
  - This model supplies the missing tensor link for mapping Pirouette’s physics
    onto computation, consciousness, and cosmology simultaneously.
