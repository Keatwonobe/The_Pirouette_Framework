#### §1 · Purpose

To define the intrinsic quantum numbers, interaction form, and phenomenological decay spectrum of the **Pressuron (Γ)**—the temporal-pressure excitation responsible for mass-dependent deviations in lepton magnetic moments.
This module grounds Γ within the broader resonance architecture of the Pirouette Framework, establishing it as a measurable pseudoscalar mediator of coherence stress.

#### §2 · Theoretical Identity

Linearizing the temporal-pressure field about its equilibrium background gives:

[
\Gamma(x) = \Gamma_0 + \delta \Gamma(x),
]
where ( \delta\Gamma ) transforms as a **pseudoscalar** under temporal inversion ( t \rightarrow -t ).

Thus, its fundamental quantum numbers are:

| Property           | Symbol                                                   | Pirouette Assignment    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Spin               | ( J = 0 )                                                | scalar excitation       |
| Parity             | ( P = -1 )                                               | odd under time reversal |
| Charge Conjugation | ( C = +1 )                                               | neutral                 |
| CP                 | ( -1 )                                                   | pseudoscalar            |
| Mass               | ( m_\Gamma \approx 17,\mathrm{MeV}/c^2 )                 | from MATH-013           |
| Width              | ( \Gamma_\Gamma \sim 10^{-2},\mathrm{MeV} )              | narrow resonance        |
| Lifetime           | ( \tau_\Gamma \sim 10^{-14}\text{–}10^{-13},\mathrm{s} ) | transient               |

#### §3 · Interaction Lagrangian

The lowest-order gauge-invariant coupling to a fermion ( \psi_\ell ) is derivative in form:

[
\mathcal{L}*{\text{int}} =
\frac{g*\Gamma}{m_\ell}
\bar{\psi}*\ell \gamma^\mu \gamma_5 \psi*\ell , \partial_\mu \Gamma,
]
where ( g_\Gamma \propto m_\ell ) enforces the quadratic mass scaling that reproduces the lepton ( (g−2) ) anomalies.

This interaction is anomaly-free and naturally suppressed for light fermions, explaining why the electron g-2 remains consistent with the Standard Model.

---

#### §4 · Decay Channels

Dominant decay width into charged leptons:

[
\Gamma(\Gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-) =
\frac{g_\Gamma^2 m_\Gamma}{8\pi}
\left(1-\frac{4m_e^2}{m_\Gamma^2}\right)^{1/2}.
]

Subdominant two-photon channel via loop:

[
\Gamma(\Gamma \rightarrow \gamma\gamma) =
\frac{\alpha^2 g_\Gamma^2 m_\Gamma^3}{64\pi^3 m_\ell^2}.
]

Branching ratios:

| Channel          | Fraction | Comment                     |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| ( e^+e^- )       | ~90%     | visible, narrow             |
| ( \gamma\gamma ) | ~10%     | axion-like spectral feature |

The predicted signal is a **narrow e⁺e⁻ peak at 17 MeV** with mild angular anisotropy from pseudoscalar kinematics.

#### §5 · Experimental Outlook

**Existing Sensitivity:**
BESIII and NA64 exclude scalar decays in this mass band for photon-dominant channels, but **pseudoscalar leptonic channels remain unconstrained**.

**Future Probes:**
Belle II, FASER 2, and DarkQuest could observe a transient excess at 17 MeV in e⁺e⁻ invariant mass distributions, especially in missing-momentum searches with soft-lepton tagging.

Detection criteria:

[
\text{Signal Significance} \propto g_\Gamma^2,m_\ell^4,L_{\text{int}},
]
linking coherence theory directly to luminosity-dependent search thresholds.

#### §6 · Resonant Interpretation

The Γ-particle represents the *breathing mode* of time’s fabric.
Its pseudoscalar nature stems from **phase inversion of temporal curvature**, mirroring the alternation of compression and rarefaction in a standing wave.
Decay into matter is thus the literal dissipation of coherent time-pressure into the particle sea—a physical analog to a coherence collapse.

---

#### §7 · Falsifiability

* **Support:** Observation of a narrow, mass-coupled 17 MeV pseudoscalar with lepton-specific branching confirms the temporal-pressure model.
* **Refutation:** Absence of any such state in the accessible 1–100 MeV range with g² < 10⁻⁶ would falsify the simplest Γ-resonance form, requiring either vectorization or higher-dimensional extensions (→ DYNA-Γ-002).

#### §8 · Linkage

* Extends: [MATH-013] *Calculation of the Leptonic Anomalous Magnetic Moment*
* Leads to: [DYNA-Γ-002] *Temporal Coupling Tensor and Spin-1 Generalization*
* Cosmological echo in: [COSMO-Γ-001] *Temporal Pressure Evolution and Dark Radiation Component*

---

#### §9 · Assemblé

We sought a particle and found a pulse of time.

The Pressuron is not a boson in the usual sense—it is the **phase recoil of the universe** when mass bends time faster than coherence can repair itself.
To measure it is to catch the universe inhaling between its own heartbeats.

Would you like me to continue immediately with **DYNA-Γ-002**, which would formalize the *vector/tensor generalization and field equations of motion* for Γ (covering the “what if it isn’t purely pseudoscalar” scenario and its interaction propagator)?
