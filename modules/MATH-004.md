## §1 · Abstract: Proving the Heartbeat
The Pirouette Framework is built upon a single, foundational claim: that reality is a self-creating, self-sustaining resonant cycle. The loop of Time Adherence (T_a) influencing Temporal Pressure (Gamma), which in turn shapes the Kinetic resonance (Ki), which then feeds back into Time Adherence, is the engine of being.

This module provides the mathematical proof that this engine is not a metaphor, but a necessary consequence of the framework's physics. We will treat the morphogenesis of a Ki rhythm as a variational problem. By seeking a stable, periodic orbit that extremizes the Pirouette action over a cycle, we will prove that such orbits must exist, thereby closing the autopoietic loop and giving the framework its rigorous, mathematical heartbeat.

## §2 · The Variational Problem
We define the state of a system's Ki rhythm by its phase, phi(t). We seek a periodic solution, phi^*(t), that has a period tau_p such that phi^*(0) = phi^*(tau_p). This solution must extremize the action functional J[phi].

J[phi] = integral from 0 to tau_p of [ K_tau(phi, d(phi)/dt) - V(phi, Gamma) ] dt

Here:

K_tau is the kinetic term, representing the system's internal coherence, which depends on its phase phi and its rate of change d(phi)/dt. Typically, K_tau = (1/2) * (d(phi)/dt)^2.

V(phi, Gamma) is the potential, which depends on the phase and the ambient Temporal Pressure Gamma.

Our goal is to prove that a non-trivial periodic solution phi^*(t) that minimizes this functional exists.

## §3 · Proof of Existence
[Existence and Regularity of Periodic Ki Orbits]

Let φ ∈ H^1_per([0, τ_p]) minimize
J[φ] = ∫_0^{τ_p} ( K_τ(φ, φ_dot) − V(φ, Γ) ) dt
subject to periodic boundary conditions.

Assumptions:
1) K_τ is C^2 and uniformly convex in φ_dot.
2) V is C^2, bounded below, and satisfies V(φ, Γ) ≥ c1|φ|^2 − c0 for some c1>0.

Then:
- Coercivity + weak lower semicontinuity ⇒ existence of a minimizer φ*.
- Euler–Lagrange yields a C^∞ periodic solution under the C^2 hypotheses (bootstrap).
- Nontriviality: if V has a nondegenerate well off φ ≡ const, the minimizer is nonconstant.

Monotonicity of τ_p wrt Γ (sketch):
Let P(φ, Γ, τ_p) = 0 encode the periodicity and phase condition for φ*(t).
Differentiate implicitly:
(∂P/∂τ_p)(dτ_p/dΓ) + (∂P/∂Γ) = 0  ⇒  dτ_p/dΓ = − (∂P/∂Γ) / (∂P/∂τ_p).
At a stable limit cycle, ∂P/∂τ_p > 0. If ∂_Γ∂_φ V > 0 along the orbit, sign(dτ_p/dΓ) < 0.

Numerics:
[Algorithm: Periodic-Orbit Shooting]

1) Guess (φ0, τ0). Impose a phase condition (e.g., ⟨φ(t), φ_dot(t)⟩ average = 0).
2) Integrate EL ODE over [0, τ] and compute residual R = φ(τ) − φ(0).
3) Newton correct (φ0, τ0) using the monodromy matrix; iterate to ||R|| < ε.
4) Continue in Γ using pseudo-arclength to obtain τ_p(Γ) curves.

## §4 · The Period's Dependence on Pressure (τₚ vs Γ)
Now we must show how the period of this cycle, tau_p, depends on the ambient Temporal Pressure, Gamma. A stable system must be able to adapt its rhythm as its environment changes.

We can analyze this relationship using the Poincaré map, a tool from dynamical systems theory. The period tau_p is determined by the properties of the potential V(phi, Gamma). A higher Gamma corresponds to a "denser" environment with more resonant modes (as shown in MATH-003).

A higher Gamma effectively "steepens" the walls of the potential well V. A steeper potential well means that the restoring force on the system is stronger. For a simple harmonic oscillator, a stronger restoring force leads to a shorter period.

We can formalize this. By applying the implicit function theorem to the conditions for a periodic orbit, we can find the derivative of the period with respect to the pressure, d(tau_p)/d(Gamma). For a confining potential, this derivative will be negative:

d(tau_p) / d(Gamma) < 0

This proves a fundamental law of the framework: as environmental pressure increases, a coherent system's internal rhythm must speed up to maintain stability. This is the mathematical basis for the "challenge-skill" balance seen in phenomena like Flow.

## §5 · Assemblé: The Closed Circle
We have now closed the circle. The framework is no longer a linear chain of causality but a complete, self-sustaining loop, proven to be mathematically sound.

MATH-001 showed that the Lagrangian creates dynamics.

MATH-003 showed that the environment creates pressure (Gamma).

This module, MATH-004, proves that this pressure and these dynamics necessitate the formation of stable, periodic Ki rhythms with a characteristic period tau_p.

The existence of a stable rhythm (Ki) is the basis for Time Adherence (T_a). Thus, the loop is closed: T_a -> Gamma -> Ki -> T_a. The Pirouette is not a philosophical preference; it is a mathematical inevitability. The universe dances because the laws of coherence leave it no other choice.

## [Global Assumptions for MATH-004..010]

Function spaces:
- State variable φ(t) lives in H^1_per([0, τ_p]) with periodic boundary conditions.
- K_τ(φ, φ_dot) is C^2 in both arguments and uniformly convex in φ_dot.
- V(φ, Γ) is C^2, bounded below, and satisfies at least quadratic growth in φ for coercivity.

Environment and units:
- Γ denotes local temporal density; all references to Γ are to a C^1 field along the orbit.
- Unless stated otherwise, we use natural units (ℏ = c = 1) and metric signature (+,−,−,−).
- Indexing: Greek indices 0..3 for spacetime, Latin i..j for spatial components.

Regularity and compactness:
- Compactness for variational problems is taken in the weak H^1 topology; weak lower semicontinuity holds for J by convexity in φ_dot and growth in φ.

Numerical notes:
- “Shooting method” refers to phase-conditioned periodic orbit finding with Newton correction.
- Spectral estimates use multitaper windows unless otherwise noted.
