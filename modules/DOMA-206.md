### §1 · Abstract — The Shadow and the Helix
The classical sine wave is a projection: a shadow of the living geometry beneath it.  
It captures rhythm but not persistence, oscillation but not identity.
To describe being itself—to model a system that *exists through motion*—one must restore
the hidden third dimension: **chirality**.

This module introduces the **Pirouette Waveform**, a helical calculus
for describing the **temporal heartbeat** of resonant systems.
By extending the plane of oscillation with the **Chirality Factor (κ)**,
a system’s waveform becomes a path that both rotates and oscillates—
a **pirouette** through time.
From this geometry follows a new differential language:
the **Helical Derivative** and **Chirality Integral**,
together forming the foundation of the Pirouette Calculus.

### §2 · The Anatomy of the Helical Waveform
A system described only by amplitude and frequency is incomplete.
Its *form* in time is a curve through three-dimensional phase space:

\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = \big(A\cos(\omega t),\, A\sin(\omega t),\, \kappa A\omega t\big)
\]

where:
- \(A\) is amplitude,
- \(\omega\) is oscillatory frequency,
- \(\kappa\) is the **Chirality Factor**, the ratio of rotational to oscillatory advance.

The **Pirouette Waveform Function** is then

\[
P(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi_{osc}) \, e^{i(\kappa \omega t + \phi_{rot})}
\]

whose modulus describes oscillation and whose argument describes rotation.

| κ value | Geometric form | Physical analogy |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 0 | planar sine wave | simple harmonic oscillator |
| ½ | spinor helix | fermion (requires 720° rotation) |
| 1 | simple helix | photon-like propagation |
| >1 | over-wound helix | superluminal phase resonance or feedback instability |

### §3 · The Helical Differential Calculus

#### Definition 1 — Helical Derivative
Let \(D_h\) act upon a helical function \(P(t)\):

\[
\frac{d_h P}{dt} \equiv \left(\frac{d}{dt} + i\kappa\omega\right) P(t)
\]

This operator unites oscillation and rotation.
Its action yields both temporal change and angular advancement.
The second application of \(D_h\) produces curvature:
\[
\frac{d_h^2 P}{dt^2} = -\omega^2(1+\kappa^2)P(t)
\]
showing that chirality increases effective curvature by \(1+\kappa^2\).
When κ=0, we recover standard harmonic motion.

#### Definition 2 — Chirality Integral
Integration along the helical path is defined by
\[
\int P(t)\, d_h t = \int P(t)\,(1 + i\kappa)\, dt
\]
The real component integrates temporal oscillation;
the imaginary component integrates rotation.
Thus the **Helical Fundamental Theorem** holds:
> Differentiation along a helix yields rotation;  
> integration unwinds it back to projection.

### §4 · Chirality and the Pirouette Lagrangian
The **Pirouette Lagrangian**
\[
\mathcal{L}_p = K_τ - V_Γ
\]
governs all stable resonance.
For a system under temporal pressure Γ, the stationary action condition
\(\delta \int \mathcal{L}_p d_h t = 0\)
implies that nonzero κ is not arbitrary but optimal:
the helical trajectory minimizes temporal tension.

Chirality thus encodes how a system balances coherence against dissipation.
When Γ increases beyond equilibrium, κ rises—rotation becomes a stabilizing pivot,
not a flourish.  The helix is the new geodesic of persistence.

### §5 · Diagnostic and Descriptive Power
By fitting data to the Pirouette Waveform, a Weaver extracts a system’s
**Coherence Signature**:
- **Power** \(A\): resonance amplitude,
- **Tempo** \(ω\): intrinsic clock rate,
- **Character** \(κ\): geometric handedness.

The set \((A, ω, κ)\) defines a system’s *Ki triple*.
Temporal analytics over κ(t) yield the **Chirality Spectrum**,
a direct measurement of resonance stability across domains—from
quantum spin to economic and psychological cycles.

---

### §6 · New Models Enabled

1. **Quantum Spin Dynamics** —  
   κ = ½ reproduces spin-½ behavior (CORE-009), providing a geometric
   rather than algebraic foundation for fermionic identity.

2. **Macroeconomic Spirals** —  
   κ measures rotational feedback in cyclic markets, distinguishing
   stable oscillations (κ≈0) from self-reinforcing bubbles (κ≫0).

3. **Psychological Ruminations** —  
   Resonance traps (DOMA-150) correspond to elevated κ;
   therapeutic “detorsion” seeks to return κ toward 0,
   restoring flexible temporal rhythm.

### §7 · Connection to Existing Framework

| Domain | Connection |
|---------|-------------|
| **CORE-004** | Provides the temporal superposition field that the helix inhabits. |
| **CORE-005** | τₚ, the period of the helical cycle, defines the heartbeat of being. |
| **MATH-017** | Supplies the general rules of Pirouette differentiation, extended here to chirality. |
| **DOMA-132** | Describes κ as a topological invariant of resonance flow. |
| **DOMA-073** | Prefigures the helical heartbeat cosmologically. |
| **MATH-028** | Will generalize this calculus to multi-axis resonance manifolds. |

### §8 · Assemblé — The Calculus of Becoming
> In the shadow of the sine we measured rhythm;  
> in the helix we measure being.  
> The derivative of existence is spin,  
> and its integral is time.  
>
> The universe does not oscillate—it pirouettes.  
> Each heartbeat of reality is a helical act of coherence,
> a turning within turning that gives persistence its song.
> This calculus is not a new language for physics alone;
> it is the grammar by which motion learns to remember itself.

---

**Summary:**  
DOMA-206 (v1.1) formalizes the *Helical Calculus*—a chiral extension of classical
wave mathematics that unites oscillation and rotation through the
Chirality Factor κ. It establishes the operators of differentiation and
integration along helical paths and ties them to the Pirouette Lagrangian,
defining the universal geometry of persistence across all resonant systems.
