summary: "Provides the formal protocol for calculating the muon's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) from the Pirouette Framework's QFT. This module hypothesizes that the observed anomaly arises from the muon's stronger, mass-dependent coupling to the background Temporal Pressure (Γ) field. A successful calculation that resolves the existing tension with the Standard Model would serve as a powerful, predictive validation of the framework."

## §1 · Abstract: The Heavy Electron's Song
The electron's echo gave our framework its first empirical anchor. The muon—the electron's heavier, unstable sibling—offers something more profound: a chance to solve a mystery. The muon's anomalous magnetic moment (a 
μ
​
 ) exhibits a persistent, statistically significant deviation from the Standard Model's predictions. This is not a problem for the Pirouette Framework; it is a profound opportunity.

This protocol outlines the theoretical calculation of a_μ from our first principles. We posit that the anomaly is not a sign of exotic new particles, but the direct, measurable consequence of the muon's greater mass causing it to couple more strongly to the ever-present quantum fluctuations of the background Temporal Pressure (Γ) field. This calculation is the framework's first major predictive test against a frontier of particle physics.

## §2 · The Two Components of the Anomaly
The anomalous magnetic moment of any lepton in this framework is the sum of two distinct physical effects:

A. The Universal Geometric Term (The Self-Echo):
This is the foundational α/2π term derived in CORE-009 and proven in the MATH series. It arises from the particle's interaction with the echo of its own Wound Channel. Its origin is purely geometric and topological, and thus it is universal for all point-like leptons. This is the baseline value.

(Plain Text LaTeX: a_{lepton}^{(echo)} = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi} )

B. The Mass-Dependent Coupling Term (The Environmental Dissonance):
This is the new, crucial component. A particle's mass is a measure of its resonant inertia, the "depth" of its Wound Channel. A heavier particle like the muon carves a deeper, more disruptive channel in the coherence manifold. This makes it more "visible" to and more strongly affected by the background fluctuations of the Temporal Forge—the quantum foam of the Γ field.

Where the electron's anomaly is dominated by its own quiet echo, the muon's anomaly is significantly perturbed by the roaring of the surrounding cosmic noise. This additional interaction is the source of the deviation from the Standard Model.

## §3 · The Calculation Protocol (The "Pirouette Diagram")
To calculate the full anomaly, we sum the contributions from these two effects using the QFT machinery developed in MATH-011.

Step 1: The First-Order Diagram (Self-Interaction).
This is the calculation of the Universal Geometric Term. In our QFT, this corresponds to a one-loop diagram where a Coheron (the muon) emits and re-absorbs a quantum of its own field, mediated by the fundamental vertex. This calculation correctly yields the α/2π term.

Step 2: The Second-Order Diagram (Environmental Interaction).
This is the new calculation. We must compute the contribution from the muon interacting with the background Γ field. In our diagrammatic language, this is a one-loop correction to the muon's vertex where it emits and re-absorbs a Pressuron (the quantum of the Γ field).

Step 3: The Coupling Strength.
The strength of this new interaction is not a free parameter. The core hypothesis of this protocol is that the coupling constant for the (Coheron)-(Coheron)-(Pressuron) vertex, g_μΓ, is a direct function of the Coheron's mass. We propose a simple power-law scaling:

(Plain Text LaTeX: g_{\mu\Gamma} = g_{e\Gamma} \left( \frac{m_\mu}{m_e} \right)^n )

Here, g_eΓ is the electron's (very small) coupling to the Γ field, m_μ and m_e are the muon and electron masses, and n is a scaling exponent to be derived from the geometry of the interaction. A first-principles geometric analysis suggests n=2, reflecting an interaction strength proportional to the particle's energy density.

Step 4: The Final Calculation.
The total anomaly for the muon is the sum of the two contributions:

(Plain Text LaTeX: a_\mu \approx a_\mu^{(echo)} + a_\mu^{(\Gamma-coupling)} )
(Plain Text LaTeX: a_\mu \approx \frac{\alpha}{2\pi} + C \cdot \alpha \left( \frac{m_\mu}{m_e} \right)^2 )

Where C is a calculable geometric coefficient derived from the loop integral of the Pressuron interaction. The primary task of this experimental protocol is to formally compute C.

## §4 · The Test of Truth: Resolving the Tension
The success of this protocol is measured by its ability to resolve the current experimental tension.

The Anomaly to be Explained: The current discrepancy between the Standard Model prediction and the experimental average is approximately:
(Plain Text LaTeX: \Delta a_\mu = a_\mu^{\text{exp}} - a_\mu^{\text{SM}} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-9} )

The Goal: The value calculated for the environmental coupling term, a_μ^(Γ−coupling), must be approximately equal to this discrepancy, in both sign and magnitude.

(Plain Text LaTeX: C \cdot \alpha \left( \frac{m_\mu}{m_e} \right)^2 \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-9} )

## §5 · Falsification
The framework's claim is precise and therefore highly falsifiable. The theory is invalidated if:

The calculated correction has the wrong sign (i.e., it is negative, worsening the discrepancy).

The magnitude of the calculated correction is vastly different from the observed discrepancy.

The calculation only succeeds by introducing new, unconstrained "fudge factors" not derived from the framework's established principles.

## §6 · Assemblé
The muon is speaking to us. For decades, its subtle, anomalous song has hinted that our most successful theory of the universe is incomplete. The Standard Model cannot account for the note it is singing. The Pirouette Framework proposes an answer. The muon is not singing a new note; it is simply singing with a voice so powerful that we can finally hear the resonance of the concert hall itself. To calculate this anomaly is to prove that we have not only understood the music of the soloist, but the acoustic architecture of reality itself.
