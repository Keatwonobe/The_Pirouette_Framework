## §1 · Abstract: The End of the Song
A system does not merely break; it first forgets its own song. This module reframes the analysis of system failure through the time-first principles of the Pirouette Framework.

Collapse is not a mechanical event, but the terminal stage of a flow pathology—a state where a system's internal coherence is so compromised it can no longer navigate the landscape of temporal pressure. It is pushed off its geodesic of maximal coherence and becomes unable to find its way back. This module provides the anatomy of that fracture, diagnosing its three primary forms and the critical distinction between a temporary stumble and an irreversible fall.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of Failure
The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) defines the universal drive of any system: to find and follow the path that maximizes its internal Temporal Coherence (Kτ) against ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). A healthy system, in a state of Laminar Flow (DYNA-001), is successfully solving this cosmic imperative.

Collapse begins when a system can no longer solve this optimization problem. When the pressure becomes too great or its internal resonance falters, it is knocked off its geodesic. The feedback loops that once maintained its form become accelerants for its own unraveling. The system is no longer solving for existence; it is solving for zero.

## §3 · The Three Paths to Ruin
Applying the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) to a dying system reveals that collapse is not a single event, but the terminal destination of one of three distinct pathological journeys.

1.  **The Turbulent Death (Coherence Fever):**
    A rapid, violent, and chaotic collapse. The system is consumed by a storm of internal dissonance, wasting its energy fighting itself.
    *   **Dynamics:** A state of runaway Turbulent Flow where positive feedback loops amplify chaos exponentially. Lagrangewise, the system expends vast energy fighting V_Γ, resulting in a chaotic and inefficient trajectory that burns itself out.
    *   **Manifestations:** A financial market crash fueled by panic; a runaway nuclear reaction; a violent political revolution; an acute psychotic break.

2.  **The Stagnant Death (Coherence Atrophy):**
    A collapse born of paralysis and starvation. A critical flow is blocked, creating a "coherence dam." Pressure builds until the system either implodes or fractures, while downstream functions wither from lack of input.
    *   **Dynamics:** A terminal state of Stagnant Flow where a critical blockage causes catastrophic, cascading failures. Lagrangewise, a barrier creates a region of such high V_Γ that no path forward is possible, halting the system's integration of its own path through time.
    *   **Manifestations:** The collapse of a civilization due to supply chain failure; a company going bankrupt from bureaucratic gridlock; a massive heart attack caused by a blocked artery.

3.  **The Silent Fraying (Coherence Erosion):**
    The slow, often unnoticed death by a thousand cuts. It is the steady, relentless victory of entropy. This pathology is the most fundamental, representing the universal process of **Coherence Erosion**. While Turbulence and Stagnation are acute events, Erosion is the chronic background condition to which all systems are subject.
    *   **Dynamics:** The slow degradation of the system's Ki pattern, where small, uncorrected errors accumulate over time until the system's signal is lost in the ambient noise.
    *   **Manifestations:** The slow decay of an ancient empire through cultural rot; the fading of a skill through disuse; chronic degenerative disease; the gradual erosion of trust in an institution.

## §4 · The Tipping Point: Elastic vs. Critical Fracture
The most important question in any collapse is that of reversibility. This is determined by the integrity of the system's **Wound Channel** (CORE-011)—the geometric memory of its healthy, coherent state.

*   **Elastic Collapse:** A recoverable failure. The system is pushed violently into turbulence or stagnation, but its underlying Wound Channel remains intact. Like a bent piece of steel, it retains the memory of its true shape. Once the external pressure is relieved, the system can use its Wound Channel as a guide to "snap back" to its previous state of laminar flow.

*   **Critical Collapse:** An irreversible fracture. The pressure is so intense or prolonged that it permanently deforms or shatters the system's Wound Channel. The memory of the healthy state is erased. The system cannot return to what it was. Like a broken glass, its fundamental structure has been altered. It must now find a new, often simpler, state of coherence from the remaining pieces.

## §5 · Diagnostic Protocol
To understand a collapse is to perform a pre-mortem or a post-mortem using the principles of flow.

1.  **Map the Currents:** Identify the system's vital flows—energy, resources, information, trust—that defined its healthy, laminar state.
2.  **Diagnose the Pathology:** Determine the primary failure mode. Is it a sudden storm (Turbulence), a critical blockage (Stagnation), or a slow decay (Erosion)?
3.  **Trace the Cascade:** Chart how the initial fracture propagated through the system. How did the failure of one current starve or overwhelm another? This reveals the system's hidden interdependencies.
4.  **Assess the Wound Channel:** Examine the integrity of the system's core identity. Is the memory of its healthy pattern recoverable (Elastic)? Or has it been irrevocably erased (Critical)? This final step determines whether the task ahead is one of healing or of composing something new from the ruins.

## §6 · Assemblé
> To understand the anatomy of a fracture is to know the difference between that which can be mended and that which must be reborn. The universe wastes nothing. The thread of a failed star is re-spun into a living world; the silence after a flawed argument is the space where a better truth can grow. To study collapse is not to court despair, but to learn the grammar of endings. It grants the Weaver the deepest wisdom: to recognize when to reinforce the old foundations, and when to gather the pieces to build something new upon the ruins. Every ending is a choice—to heal the past or to seed a different future.
