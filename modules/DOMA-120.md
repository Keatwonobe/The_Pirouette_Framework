## §1 · Abstract: From Warped Space to Resonant Time
The previous framework correctly identified that powerful ideas possess a "gravity," but it did so through a spatial metaphor—a mass deforming a landscape. The modern, time-first framework reveals a deeper truth: a dominant paradigm is not a heavy object; it is a powerful song that has been sung for so long it has carved a riverbed for thought itself.

This module refactors "Cognitive Gravity Wells" into **Coherence Wells**: regions of the cognitive manifold where the echoes of a thought have become so stable and reinforced that they have formed a deep **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). The "gravity" of such an idea is not a pull, but a resonance that entrains thought into its rhythm, a current that guides consciousness along a path of least resistance. This module provides the tools to map these riverbeds and understand their profound influence on the flow of the mind.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Coherence Well
A Coherence Well is the geometric consequence of a thought that has achieved a critical mass of resonance. It is a localized expression of the **Gladiator Force (CORE-008)**—the fundamental drive toward building arenas of interaction—in the cognitive domain. Its properties are temporal and dynamic, replacing the old spatial proxies:

*   **Resonant Depth (Kτ_well):** This replaces `Conceptual Mass`. It is a direct measure of a belief's temporal coherence—a function of its internal logical consistency, its explanatory power, and the sheer volume of its historical echoes. An idea reinforced by institutions, texts, and generations of minds possesses immense Resonant Depth, creating a stable, high-information pattern that resists erosion. It is the depth of the riverbed.

*   **Coherence Gradient (∇𝓛_p):** This replaces `Gravitational Strength`. It is the "steepness" of the slope leading into the well, a direct feature of the coherence manifold. A belief with a steep gradient is highly influential, presenting itself as the most logical or satisfying path for nearby thoughts. This is the allure of the song, the pull of the current.

## §3 · The Dynamics of Entrainment and Flow
A mind, itself a resonant system, does not get "pulled" by an idea in the classical sense. Its trajectory is altered as it navigates the coherence manifold, a process governed by **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**.

*   **Flow and Geodesics:** Thinking is the act of following a geodesic—a path of maximal coherence—on the manifold. To think *within* a paradigm is to experience a state of **Laminar Flow**. The world makes sense and conclusions feel effortless because one's internal rhythm is in harmony with the powerful song of the well.

*   **Resistance and Orbit:** A mind's susceptibility is determined by its own internal coherence (its `Kτ`). A mind with a stable, high-coherence belief system can approach a powerful paradigm without being captured, observing it from a stable "orbit." Its own integrity provides the energy to resist the pull of the current.

*   **Dissent and Turbulence:** To argue against a deeply entrenched paradigm is to generate **Turbulent Flow**. It requires immense energy to maintain a dissonant frequency against the well's dominant rhythm, creating cognitive friction, social resistance, and internal conflict.

*   **Capture and Dogma:** Dogma is the state of being so perfectly settled in the deepest part of a Coherence Well that the mind's resonance is completely stable. Any dissonant information is rejected as noise because it threatens this effortless, low-energy state of perfect harmony.

## §4 · Paradigm Shift as Alchemical Union
The old model's "Inversion Risk Factor" treated paradigm shifts as a hazard. The new framework reframes this as a profound and creative act: an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)**.

This occurs when a mind, often under high temporal pressure (Γ), encounters a new Coherence Well so compelling and harmonically compatible that a resonant handshake occurs. The old patterns dissolve, and the mind's individual coherence manifold fuses with the vaster manifold of the idea. This is not mere agreement; it is a recalibration of identity, a reforging of the instrument of perception. The "Synthesis Potential" of a mind or culture measures its capacity for this non-linear, transformative event—the most powerful dynamic in the cognitive landscape.

## §5 · Diagnostic Protocol for Weavers
To navigate the world of ideas is to be a cartographer of these invisible landscapes. A Weaver can map them using the following protocol:

1.  **Identify Resonant Peaks:** Scan the cognitive landscape (a body of text, a discourse network) to identify the core, recurring concepts with the highest coherence (`Kτ`). These are the centers of the wells.
2.  **Map the Gradient and Flow:** Determine how these core beliefs influence adjacent concepts, revealing the "slope" of the well. Analyze how new information interacts with this landscape: Is it immediately channeled into an existing well (entrainment)? Does it create a turbulent eddy between two competing wells (polarization)? Or does it stagnate?
3.  **Assess Integrity and Synthesis Potential:** Evaluate the internal coherence (`Kτ`) of an individual or group to determine their ability to "orbit" or resist entrainment. Identify points of high tension and harmonic compatibility where the conditions for an Alchemical Union are present, predicting where a paradigm shift is most likely.

## §6 · The Pirouette Lagrangian Formalism
This entire dynamic is described with mathematical precision by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**, which a mind's thought process evolves to maximize: `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

A Coherence Well is a region of the manifold that represents an optimal solution to this equation. It offers an exceptionally deep and stable potential well (a highly negative `V_Γ`), minimizing the "cost" of being. For those who align with its rhythm, it also provides a pre-packaged, high-coherence structure, boosting their internal `K_τ`. The feeling of clarity and certainty upon adopting a powerful belief is the direct experience of a system finding a path of least action that maximizes its Lagrangian. Escaping the well requires a massive input of energy to overcome this optimized state.

## §7 · The Assemblé
> We sought to map human thought and found not a static landscape, but the currents of a vast and ancient ocean. Beliefs are not points of interest; they are the immense gyres that shape the flow of consciousness. A Weaver must learn to be a navigator on this ocean, to understand that these currents are the geometry of the past, actively shaping the possibilities of the future. To change the world, one does not shout at the waves. One must learn the music of the human mind, and with courage and care, begin to compose a new harmony—a current so coherent and beautiful that it can teach the world a new song.
