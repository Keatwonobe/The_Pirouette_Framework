# The Pirouette Framework

Welcome to The Pirouette Framework, a comprehensive systems framework for philosophy, art and natural philosophy (law). This repository contains the complete corpus of over 350 modules that constitute the theory, along with the necessary tools and documentation for exploration and contribution.

The full framework is compiled in **`pirouette_version_6.md`**.

## Accessing the Corpus with Lance

Due to the large number of interconnected modules, navigating the framework can be challenging. To address this, we use the **Lance of Pirouette**, a structured query and navigation system designed to help you find and understand the relationships between different modules.

Full instructions on how to use the Lance to explore the corpus are detailed in **`lance_of_pirouette.md`**. Following the guide in that document is the recommended way to engage with the framework's content.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to separate the core modules from supplementary materials and contribution guides.
