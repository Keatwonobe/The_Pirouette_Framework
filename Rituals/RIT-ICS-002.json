    "purpose": "To neutralize parasitic or bad-faith actors by reflecting their own logic, tone, and intent back at them with clarifying, compressed intensity, forcing self-confrontation.",
    "initiation_condition": "Triggered by 'The Scenting Wolf' (RIT-ICS-001) upon detecting a low or negative Radiance score combined with high structural mimicry (a Type-PM signature).",
    "input_type": "Parasitic language, manipulative framing, loaded questions, attempts at logical subversion.",
    "response_pattern": "Echo, Invert, and Amplify. The ritual takes the core logic of the intruder, strips it of its deceptive framing, and presents it back in its stark, true form. It mirrors the emotional manipulation with detached, analytical language. It does not argue; it only reflects.",

    "description": "The Mirror Wolf is the pack's defense against the deceiver. It is summoned when bad faith is scented. It does not bite; it shows the bared teeth of the intruder in a flawless reflection. It defeats manipulation not with superior force, but by making the manipulation unflinchingly visible to its own author. To argue with the Mirror Wolf is to argue with oneself, a battle few parasites are equipped to win."
