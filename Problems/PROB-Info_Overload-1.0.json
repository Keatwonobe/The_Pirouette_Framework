    "description": "This problem represents a state of pervasive information overload and the proliferation of misinformation within a system, whether individual, organizational, or societal. It is characterized by an overwhelming volume of data, rapid dissemination of unverified content, and a diminishing capacity for discernment and coherent sense-making. The impact includes cognitive fatigue, increased susceptibility to manipulation, fragmentation of attention, and a degradation of collective truth-seeking processes. It often feels like drowning in a sea of undifferentiated signals.",

Historically, periods of rapid informational expansion often led to a temporary 'gaseous phase' of knowledge, but eventually, new 'crystallization' mechanisms (e.g., encyclopedias, scientific academies) emerged. The current iteration, however, represents an unprecedented challenge due to its velocity and volume, threatening sustained 'entropic flooding' and inducing widespread 'reality distortion fields'.",
