    "description": "This problem describes a state of deep-seated organizational stagnation, where a system struggles to adapt, innovate, or respond effectively to changing internal or external conditions. It is characterized by rigid processes, a strong resistance to novelty, and a diminished capacity for creative output or responsive evolution. The impact includes declining market relevance, internal friction, loss of talent, and an impeded ability to achieve strategic objectives. It feels like an entity that has ceased to grow, its internal dynamics locked into unchanging, unproductive patterns.",

Historically, organizations suffering from this problem have often faced abrupt 'Collapse Dynamics' (TPF Vol 2, Module 2) when external pressures exceeded their capacity for adaptation. Recurrent patterns of attempted, but failed, 'Rebound Dynamics' (TPF Vol 2, Module 3) may also be observed, where initial recovery efforts are absorbed by underlying rigidity. The 'Entropy Memory Index' (TPF Vol 3, Module 29) might reveal a high score for obsolete procedures or forgotten innovation attempts that still exert a passive, dampening influence.",
