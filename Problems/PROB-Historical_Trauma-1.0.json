    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "This problem describes the enduring and often subconscious influence of unresolved historical conflict and collective trauma on a societal system. It is characterized by deep-seated wounds that persist across generations, manifesting as recurring patterns of social tension, political fragmentation, and emotional or psychological distress. The impact includes an impeded capacity for genuine reconciliation, perpetuation of harmful narratives, and a collective inability to move towards adaptive futures. It feels like being caught in a repetitive loop of past suffering, where the echoes of history prevent the present from truly unfolding.",

It often manifests as persistent 'Ghost Attractors' (TPF Vol 3, Module 30) from specific historical grievances that periodically 'Haunt' (TPF Vol 3, Module 32) contemporary societal discourse, preventing coherent future planning. This continuous emotional and narrative recursion prevents the system from moving towards states of high Time-Adherence and often locks it into dysfunctional Ki-modulated cycles of conflict.",

This problem persona is characterized by a low Time-Adherence, as its core dynamics are fragmented or inconsistent with a healthy, forward-moving trajectory, yet paradoxically, the individual traumatic memories or narratives within it might be 'stuck' in high-Ta states. The high Gladiator Force represents the intense internal pressure and emotional turbulence associated with unprocessed trauma, or rigid boundaries around painful historical facts. This paradox is key to its 'spectral' nature."
