    "description": "This problem manifests as severe and persistent fragmentation and polarization within a societal system. It is characterized by the breakdown of shared narratives, erosion of common ground, and an increasing inability for diverse groups to engage in constructive dialogue or collective action. The impact is a decline in social cohesion, heightened conflict (rhetorical or physical), and an impeded capacity for the society to adapt to external challenges. It often presents as a network fractured into rigid, mutually antagonistic clusters.",

Its trajectory often moves through successive 'Fourfurcation' events, deepening the divides rather than resolving them, and hindering collective 'Rebound Dynamics' (TPF Vol 2, Module 3) after crises.",
