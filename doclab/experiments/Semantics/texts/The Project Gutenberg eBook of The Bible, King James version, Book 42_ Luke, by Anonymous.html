<h1 id="id00002" style="margin-top: 5em">Book 42        Luke</h1>

<p id="id00003" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:001 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
           declaration of those things which are most surely believed
           among us,</p>

<p id="id00004" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:002 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning
           were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</p>

<p id="id00005" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:003 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of
           all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order,
           most excellent Theophilus,</p>

<p id="id00006" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:004 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein
           thou hast been instructed.</p>

<p id="id00007" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:005 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain
           priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife
           was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</p>

<p id="id00008">42:001:006 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00009">42:001:007 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they both were now well stricken in years.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00010">42:001:008 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;office before God in the order of his course,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00011">42:001:009 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00012">42:001:010 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time of incense.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00013">42:001:011 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the right side of the altar of incense.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00014">42:001:012 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00015" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:013 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy
           prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son,
           and thou shalt call his name John.</p>

<p id="id00016" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:014 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice
           at his birth.</p>

<p id="id00017" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:015 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall
           drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled
           with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</p>

<p id="id00018" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:016 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
           their God.</p>

<p id="id00019" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:017 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias,
           to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the
           disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people
           prepared for the Lord.</p>

<p id="id00020" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:018 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this?
           for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</p>

<p id="id00021" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:019 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that
           stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee,
           and to shew thee these glad tidings.</p>

<p id="id00022" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:020 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until
           the day that these things shall be performed, because thou
           believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their
           season.</p>

<p id="id00023" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:021 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he
           tarried so long in the temple.</p>

<p id="id00024" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:022 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they
           perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he
           beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</p>

<p id="id00025">42:001:023 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00026">42:001:024 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;herself five months, saying,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00027">42:001:025 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on me, to take away my reproach among men.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00028">42:001:026 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00029">42:001:027 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00030" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:028 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art
           highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among
           women.</p>

<p id="id00031">42:001:029 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00032">42:001:030 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found favour with God.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00033">42:001:031 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00034" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:032 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:
           and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father
           David:</p>

<p id="id00035">42:001:033 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his kingdom there shall be no end.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00036">42:001:034 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know not a man?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00037" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:035 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall
           come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
           thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
           thee shall be called the Son of God.</p>

<p id="id00038" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:036 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a
           son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who
           was called barren.</p>

<p id="id00039">42:001:037 For with God nothing shall be impossible.</p>

<p id="id00040">42:001:038 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00041">42:001:039 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with haste, into a city of Juda;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00042">42:001:040 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00043" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:041 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation
           of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled
           with the Holy Ghost:</p>

<p id="id00044">42:001:042 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00045">42:001:043 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come to me?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00046">42:001:044 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00047">42:001:045 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00048">42:001:046 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</p>

<p id="id00049">42:001:047 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</p>

<p id="id00050">42:001:048 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00051">42:001:049 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is his name.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00052">42:001:050 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generation.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00053">42:001:051 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00054">42:001:052 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of low degree.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00055">42:001:053 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath sent empty away.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00056">42:001:054 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mercy;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00057">42:001:055 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00058">42:001:056 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her own house.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00059">42:001:057 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and she brought forth a son.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00060">42:001:058 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00061" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:001:059 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to
           circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the
           name of his father.</p>

<p id="id00062">42:001:060 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called John.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00063">42:001:061 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called by this name.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00064">42:001:062 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00065">42:001:063 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name<br>

<p id="id00244">42:005:028 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</p>

<p id="id00245">42:005:029 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there<br>

<p id="id00252" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:005:036 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life, or to destroy it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.<br>

<p id="id00320" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:007:016 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying,

<p id="id00321" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:007:017 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gave sight.<br>

<p id="id00329">42:007:025 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live delicately, are in kings' courts.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00330">42:007:026 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, and much more than a prophet.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00331">42:007:027 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00332" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:007:028 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there
           is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is
           least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</p>

<p id="id00333">42:007:029 And all the people that heard him, and the publicans,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00334">42:007:030 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against themselves, being not baptized of him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00335">42:007:031 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this generation? and to what are they like?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00336" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:007:032 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and
           calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you,
           and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have
           not wept.</p>

<p id="id00337" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:007:033 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking
           wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</p>

<p id="id00338" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:007:034 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold
           a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and
           sinners!</p>

<p id="id00339">42:007:035 But wisdom is justified of all her children.</p>

<p id="id00340">42:007:036 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meat.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00341">42:007:037 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an alabaster box of ointment,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00342">42:007:038 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ointment.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00343">42:007:039 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him: for she is a sinner.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00344">42:007:040 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00345">42:007:041 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00346">42:007:042 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00347">42:007:043 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00348" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:007:044 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou
           this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no
           water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and
           wiped them with the hairs of her head.</p>

<p id="id00349">42:007:045 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00350">42:007:046 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anointed my feet with ointment.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00351" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:007:047 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are
           forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,
           the same loveth little.</p>

<p id="id00352">42:007:048 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</p>

<p id="id00353">42:007:049 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00354">42:007:050 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peace.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00355">42:008:001 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00356">42:008:002 And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devils,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00357">42:008:003 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00358">42:008:004 And when much people were gathered together, and were come to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him out of every city, he spake by a parable:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00359" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:005 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell
           by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the
           air devoured it.</p>

<p id="id00360">42:008:006 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;withered away, because it lacked moisture.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00361">42:008:007 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and choked it.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00362" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:008 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit
           an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried,
           He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p id="id00363" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:009 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable
           be?</p>

<p id="id00364" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:010 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the
           kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they
           might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</p>

<p id="id00365">42:008:011 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</p>

<p id="id00366">42:008:012 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should believe and be saved.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00367">42:008:013 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe, and in time of temptation fall away.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00368">42:008:014 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00369">42:008:015 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruit with patience.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00370">42:008:016 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00371">42:008:017 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abroad.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00372">42:008:018 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken even that which he seemeth to have.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00373">42:008:019 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come at him for the press.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00374">42:008:020 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00375">42:008:021 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are these which hear the word of God, and do it.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00376">42:008:022 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00377">42:008:023 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in jeopardy.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00378">42:008:024 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00379" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:025 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being
           afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is
           this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they
           obey him.</p>

<p id="id00380" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:026 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is
           over against Galilee.</p>

<p id="id00381">42:008:027 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00382">42:008:028 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00383" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:029 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the
           man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound
           with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was
           driven of the devil into the wilderness.)</p>

<p id="id00384">42:008:030 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legion: because many devils were entered into him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00385">42:008:031 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the deep.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00386">42:008:032 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enter into them. And he suffered them.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00387">42:008:033 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lake, and were choked.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00388" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:034 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went
           and told it in the city and in the country.</p>

<p id="id00389" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:035 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus,
           and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed,
           sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind:
           and they were afraid.</p>

<p id="id00390" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:036 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was
           possessed of the devils was healed.</p>

<p id="id00391" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:037 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round
           about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken
           with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned
           back again.</p>

<p id="id00392" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:038 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him
           that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</p>

<p id="id00393" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:039 Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath
           done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout
           the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.</p>

<p id="id00394" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:040 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people
           gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.</p>

<p id="id00395" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:041 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler
           of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and
           besought him that he would come into his house:</p>

<p id="id00396" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:042 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and
           she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.</p>

<p id="id00397" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:043 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had
           spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed
           of any,</p>

<p id="id00398" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:044 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and
           immediately her issue of blood stanched.</p>

<p id="id00399" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:045 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and
           they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng
           thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</p>

<p id="id00400" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:046 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that

<p id="id00401" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:047 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came
           trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him
           before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and
           how she was healed immediately.</p>

<p id="id00402" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:048 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith
           hath made thee whole; go in peace.</p>

<p id="id00403" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:049 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the
           synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead;
           trouble not the Master.</p>

<p id="id00404" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:050 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not:
           believe only, and she shall be made whole.</p>

<p id="id00405" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:051 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in,
           save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother
           of the maiden.</p>

<p id="id00406" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:008:052 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is

<p id="id00408">42:008:054 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,<br>

<p id="id00409">42:008:055 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commanded to give her meat.<br>

<p id="id00410">42:008:056 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they<br>

           two coats apiece.</p>

<p id="id00414" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:004 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence

<p id="id00416" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:006 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the

<p id="id00418">42:009:008 And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the old prophets was risen again.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00419">42:009:009 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom<br>

</p>

<p id="id00420">42:009:010 And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00421">42:009:011 And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;healed them that had need of healing.<br>

<p id="id00422" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:012 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and
           said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into
           the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get
           victuals: for we are here in a desert place.</p>

<p id="id00423" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:013 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We
           have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should
           go and buy meat for all this people.</p>

<p id="id00424" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:014 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his

<p id="id00426" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:016 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking

<p id="id00427" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:017 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up

<p id="id00428" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:018 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples
           were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people
           that I am?</p>

<p id="id00429">42:009:019 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias;<br>

<p id="id00431">42:009:021 And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no<br>

           slain, and be raised the third day.</p>

<p id="id00433">42:009:023 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let<br>

<p id="id00438" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:028 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings,
           he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain
           to pray.</p>

<p id="id00439">42:009:029 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his raiment was white and glistering.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00440">42:009:030 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Elias:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00441">42:009:031 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should accomplish at Jerusalem.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00442" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:032 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep:
           and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men
           that stood with him.</p>

<p id="id00443" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:033 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said
           unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us
           make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and
           one for Elias: not knowing what he said.</p>

<p id="id00444">42:009:034 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00445">42:009:035 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beloved Son: hear him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00446" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:036 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they
           kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those
           things which they had seen.</p>

<p id="id00447">42:009:037 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down from the hill, much people met him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00448">42:009:038 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00449" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:039 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and
           it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly
           departeth from him.</p>

<p id="id00450" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:040 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could
           not.</p>

<p id="id00451">42:009:041 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hither.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00452">42:009:042 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child, and delivered him again to his father.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00453">42:009:043 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto his disciples,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00454" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:044 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man
           shall be delivered into the hands of men.</p>

<p id="id00455" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:045 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,
           that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that
           saying.</p>

<p id="id00456">42:009:046 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be greatest.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00457">42:009:047 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child, and set him by him,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00458" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:048 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my
           name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth
           him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same
           shall be great.</p>

<p id="id00459" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:049 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out
           devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth
           not with us.</p>

<p id="id00460">42:009:050 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against us is for us.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00461">42:009:051 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00462" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:052 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and
           entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for
           him.</p>

<p id="id00463" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:053 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though
           he would go to Jerusalem.</p>

<p id="id00464" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:009:054 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said,
           Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven,
           and consume them, even as Elias did?</p>

<p id="id00465">42:009:055 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manner of spirit ye are of.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00466">42:009:056 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save them. And they went to another village.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00467">42:009:057 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goest.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00468">42:009:058 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;head.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00469">42:009:059 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me first to go and bury my father.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00470">42:009:060 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and preach the kingdom of God.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00471">42:009:061 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00472">42:009:062 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00473">42:010:001 After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent them two and two before his face into every city and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place, whither he himself would come.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00474">42:010:002 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00475">42:010:003 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.</p>

<p id="id00476">42:010:004 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man<br>

<p id="id00480">42:010:008 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat<br>

<p id="id00484" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:010:012 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that

<p id="id00489">42:010:017 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even<br>

</p>

<p id="id00490">42:010:018 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from<br>

<p id="id00493" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:010:021 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee,

<p id="id00495" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:010:023 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,

<p id="id00497">42:010:025 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him,<br>

<p id="id00502" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:010:030 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from
           Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped
           him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him
           half dead.</p>

<p id="id00503">42:010:031 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00504">42:010:032 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looked on him, and passed by on the other side.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00505">42:010:033 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00506" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:010:034 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and
           wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn,
           and took care of him.</p>

<p id="id00507" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:010:035 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and
           gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him;
           and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will
           repay thee.</p>

<p id="id00508">42:010:036 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him that fell among the thieves?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00509">42:010:037 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Go, and do thou likewise.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00510" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:010:038 Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a
           certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him
           into her house.</p>

<p id="id00511" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:010:039 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus'
           feet, and heard his word.</p>

<p id="id00512" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:010:040 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him,
           and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me
           to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.</p>

<p id="id00513">42:010:041 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;careful and troubled about many things:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00514">42:010:042 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which shall not be taken away from her.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00515">42:011:001 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00516">42:011:002 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done, as in heaven, so in earth.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people wondered.<br>

           things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread
           in the kingdom of God.</p>

<p id="id00678">42:014:016 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bade many:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00679">42:014:017 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were<br>

</p>

<p id="id00680" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:014:018 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first
           said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must
           needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.</p>

<p id="id00681">42:014:019 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to<br>

<p id="id00682">42:014:020 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I<br>

           the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go
           out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring
           in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the
           blind.</p>

<p id="id00684" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:014:022 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,

<p id="id00686">42:014:024 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden<br>

<p id="id00702" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:015:005 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;substance with riotous living.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00711">42:015:014 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00718">42:015:021 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against<br>

</p>

<p id="id00723">42:015:026 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meant.<br>

<p id="id00725" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:015:028 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his

<p id="id00726" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:015:029 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I
           serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy
           commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might
           make merry with my friends:</p>

<p id="id00727">42:015:030 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00728">42:015:031 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have is thine.<br>

<p id="id00729">42:015:032 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00730">42:016:001 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he had wasted his goods.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00731">42:016:002 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mayest be no longer steward.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00732">42:016:003 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am ashamed.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00733">42:016:004 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00734">42:016:005 So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00735">42:016:006 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00736">42:016:007 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bill, and write fourscore.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00737">42:016:008 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wiser than the children of light.<br>

</p>

<p id="id00739">42:016:010 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in<br>

</p>

<p id="id00741">42:016:012 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another<br>

<p id="id00742" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:016:013 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the

           despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</p>

<p id="id00743" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:016:014 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these
           things: and they derided him.</p>

<p id="id00744" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:016:015 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves

           highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</p>

<p id="id00745">42:016:016 The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the<br>

<p id="id00746">42:016:017 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle<br>

<p id="id00748">42:016:019 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and<br>

<p id="id00752" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:016:023 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth
           Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</p>

<p id="id00753">42:016:024 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00754">42:016:025 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00755">42:016:026 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf<br>

<p id="id00758">42:016:029 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let<br>

           seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent;
           thou shalt forgive him.</p>

<p id="id00765">42:017:005 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.</p>

<p id="id00766" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:017:006 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed,
           ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by
           the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey
           you.</p>

<p id="id00767">42:017:007 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and sit down to meat?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00768">42:017:008 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00769" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:017:009 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were
           commanded him? I trow not.</p>

<p id="id00770" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:017:010 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which
           are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have
           done that which was our duty to do.</p>

<p id="id00771">42:017:011 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00772">42:017:012 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men that were lepers, which stood afar off:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00773">42:017:013 And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mercy on us.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00774" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:017:014 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves
           unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went,
           they were cleansed.</p>

<p id="id00775">42:017:015 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with a loud voice glorified God,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00776">42:017:016 And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was a Samaritan.<br>

<p id="id00777">42:017:017 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where are the nine?<br>

<p id="id00780" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:017:020 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of
           God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God
           cometh not with observation:</p>

<p id="id00781" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:017:021 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold,
           the kingdom of God is within you.</p>

<p id="id00782" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:017:022 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye
           shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye
           shall not see it.</p>

<p id="id00783" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:017:023 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not
           after them, nor follow them.</p>

<p id="id00784" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:017:024 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part

           shall also the Son of man be in his day.</p>

<p id="id00785">42:017:025 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this<br>

           the flood came, and destroyed them all.</p>

<p id="id00788">42:017:028 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they<br>

           gathered together.</p>

<p id="id00798">42:018:001 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always to pray, and not to faint;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00799">42:018:002 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God,<br>

</p>

<p id="id00800">42:018:003 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00801">42:018:004 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00802">42:018:005 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by her continual coming she weary me.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00803">42:018:006 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.</p>

<p id="id00804">42:018:007 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night unto him, though he bear long with them?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00805">42:018:008 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless<br>

</p>

<p id="id00806">42:018:009 And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00807">42:018:010 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the other a publican.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00808" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:011 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank
           thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,
           adulterers, or even as this publican.</p>

<p id="id00809">42:018:012 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</p>

<p id="id00810">42:018:013 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God be merciful to me a sinner.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00811">42:018:014 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00812" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:015 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch

<p id="id00813" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:016 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little
           children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is
           the kingdom of God.</p>

<p id="id00814">42:018:017 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom<br>

</p>

<p id="id00815">42:018:018 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do to inherit eternal life?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00816">42:018:019 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good, save one, that is, God.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00817" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:020 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not

           father and thy mother.</p>

<p id="id00818">42:018:021 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</p>

<p id="id00819" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:022 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet
           lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and
           distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
           heaven: and come, follow me.</p>

<p id="id00820" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:023 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very
           rich.</p>

<p id="id00821" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:024 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How
           hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of
           God!</p>

<p id="id00822" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:025 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye,
           than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>

<p id="id00823">42:018:026 And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?</p>

<p id="id00824" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:027 And he said, The things which are impossible with men are
           possible with God.</p>

<p id="id00825">42:018:028 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.</p>

<p id="id00826" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:029 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man

           children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</p>

<p id="id00827" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:030 Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and
           in the world to come life everlasting.</p>

<p id="id00828" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:031 Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold,
           we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the
           prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</p>

<p id="id00829">42:018:032 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be<br>

</p>

<p id="id00830">42:018:033 And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the<br>

<p id="id00831">42:018:034 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was<br>

</p>

<p id="id00832">42:018:035 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certain blind man sat by the way side begging:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00833">42:018:036 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</p>

<p id="id00834">42:018:037 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.</p>

<p id="id00835" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:038 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
           me.</p>

<p id="id00836" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:039 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold
           his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David,
           have mercy on me.</p>

<p id="id00837">42:018:040 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he was come near, he asked him,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00838">42:018:041 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, that I may receive my sight.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00839">42:018:042 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved thee.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00840" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:018:043 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
           glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave
           praise unto God.</p>

<p id="id00841">42:019:001 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.</p>

<p id="id00842">42:019:002 And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chief among the publicans, and he was rich.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00843">42:019:003 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;press, because he was little of stature.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00844">42:019:004 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him: for he was to pass that way.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00845" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:019:005 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him,
           and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for
           to day I must abide at thy house.</p>

<p id="id00846">42:019:006 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</p>

<p id="id00847" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:019:007 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was
           gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</p>

<p id="id00848" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:019:008 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the
           half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any
           thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him
           fourfold.</p>

<p id="id00849">42:019:009 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this<br>

</p>

<p id="id00850">42:019:010 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was<br>

<p id="id00851" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:019:011 And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
           because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought
           that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.</p>

<p id="id00852">42:019:012 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00853">42:019:013 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,<br>

</p>

<p id="id00854">42:019:014 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,<br>

</p>

<p id="id00855" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:019:015 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having
           received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be
           called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might
           know how much every man had gained by trading.</p>

<p id="id00856" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:019:016 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten
           pounds.</p>

<p id="id00857" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:019:017 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou

           ten cities.</p>

<p id="id00858" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:019:018 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five
           pounds.</p>

<p id="id00859">42:019:019 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.</p>

<p id="id00860" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:019:020 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound,

<p id="id00861" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:019:021 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou

<p id="id00862" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:019:022 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge
           thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere
           man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did
           not sow:</p>

<p id="id00863">42:019:023 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my coming I might have required mine own with usury?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00864">42:019:024 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound,<br>

</p>

<p id="id00865">42:019:025 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</p>

<p id="id00866" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:019:026 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be

<p id="id00867">42:019:027 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00868">42:019:028 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem.<br>

<p id="id00869">42:019:029 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his disciples,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00870">42:019:030 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00871">42:019:031 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00872">42:019:032 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had said unto them.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00873">42:019:033 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them, Why loose ye the colt?<br>

<p id="id00874">42:019:034 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</p>

<p id="id00875" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:019:035 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments

<p id="id00877" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:019:037 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the
           mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to
           rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty
           works that they had seen;</p>

<p id="id00878">42:019:038 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the<br>

</p>

<p id="id00879">42:019:039 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto<br>

<p id="id00880">42:019:040 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these<br>

</p>

<p id="id00881">42:019:041 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee in on every side,<br>

<p id="id00889" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:020:001 And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught
           the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief
           priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,</p>

<p id="id00890">42:020:002 And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest<br>

</p>

<p id="id00891">42:020:003 And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing; and answer me:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00892">42:020:004 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?</p>

<p id="id00893">42:020:005 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00894">42:020:006 But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they be persuaded that John was a prophet.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00895">42:020:007 And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.</p>

<p id="id00896" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:020:008 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority
           I do these things.</p>

<p id="id00897">42:020:009 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went into a far country for a long time.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00898">42:020:010 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00899">42:020:011 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00900">42:020:012 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him out.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00901">42:020:013 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they see him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00902">42:020:014 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the inheritance may be ours.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00903" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:020:015 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What
           therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</p>

<p id="id00904">42:020:016 He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forbid.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00905">42:020:017 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;become the head of the corner?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00906" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:020:018 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on
           whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</p>

<p id="id00907" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:020:019 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to
           lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they
           perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</p>

<p id="id00908" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:020:020 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign
           themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words,
           that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of
           the governor.</p>

<p id="id00909" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:020:021 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest
           and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of
           any, but teachest the way of God truly:</p>

<p id="id00910">42:020:022 Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?</p>

<p id="id00911">42:020:023 But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tempt ye me?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00912">42:020:024 Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered and said, Caesar's.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00913">42:020:025 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00914">42:020:026 And they could not take hold of his words before the people:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00915">42:020:027 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is any resurrection; and they asked him,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00916" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:020:028 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die,
           having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother
           should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>

<p id="id00917" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:020:029 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a
           wife, and died without children.</p>

<p id="id00918">42:020:030 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</p>

<p id="id00919" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:020:031 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and
           they left no children, and died.</p>

<p id="id00920">42:020:032 Last of all the woman died also.</p>

<p id="id00921">42:020:033 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven had her to wife.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00922">42:020:034 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marry, and are given in marriage:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00923">42:020:035 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given in marriage:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00924">42:020:036 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resurrection.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00925">42:020:037 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isaac, and the God of Jacob.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00926">42:020:038 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live unto him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00927">42:020:039 Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well said.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00928">42:020:040 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.</p>

<p id="id00929">42:020:041 And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00930">42:020:042 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00931">42:020:043 Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>

<p id="id00932">42:020:044 David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?</p>

<p id="id00933" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:020:045 Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his
           disciples,</p>

<p id="id00934" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:020:046 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and
           love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the
           synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;</p>

<p id="id00935">42:020:047 Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same shall receive greater damnation.<br>

<p id="id00936">42:021:001 And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the treasury.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00937">42:021:002 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mites.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00938">42:021:003 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath cast in more than they all:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00939" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:021:004 For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the
           offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the
           living that she had.</p>

<p id="id00940" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:021:005 And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with
           goodly stones and gifts, he said,</p>

<p id="id00941">42:021:006 As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not be thrown down.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come to pass?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00943">42:021:008 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end is not by and by.<br>

           him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to
           Pilate.</p>

<p id="id01056">42:023:012 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for before they were at enmity between themselves.<br>

<p id="id01057">42:023:013 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and<br>

</p>

<p id="id01058" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:023:014 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that
           perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him
           before you, have found no fault in this man touching those
           things whereof ye accuse him:</p>

<p id="id01059" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:023:015 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing
           worthy of death is done unto him.</p>

<p id="id01060">42:023:016 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</p>

<p id="id01061">42:023:017 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</p>

<p id="id01062">42:023:018 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and release unto us Barabbas:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01063">42:023:019 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was cast into prison.)<br>
</p>

<p id="id01064">42:023:020 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01065">42:023:021 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</p>

<p id="id01066">42:023:022 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chastise him, and let him go.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01067">42:023:023 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priests prevailed.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01068">42:023:024 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</p>

<p id="id01069">42:023:025 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus to their will.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01070">42:023:026 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01071">42:023:027 And there followed him a great company of people, and of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;women, which also bewailed and lamented him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01072">42:023:028 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01073" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:023:029 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,

<p id="id01074">42:023:030 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and<br>

<p id="id01075">42:023:031 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be<br>

<p id="id01076">42:023:032 And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put to death.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01077" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:023:033 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,
           there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the
           right hand, and the other on the left.</p>

<p id="id01078" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:023:034 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what
           they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p>

<p id="id01079" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:023:035 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them
           derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if
           he be Christ, the chosen of God.</p>

<p id="id01080" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:023:036 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering
           him vinegar,</p>

<p id="id01081">42:023:037 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</p>

<p id="id01082">42:023:038 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01083">42:023:039 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01084">42:023:040 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?<br>
</p>

<p id="id01085">42:023:041 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01086">42:023:042 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into thy kingdom.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01087">42:023:043 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou be with me in paradise.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01088">42:023:044 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the earth until the ninth hour.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01089">42:023:045 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the midst.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01090" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:023:046 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
           into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he
           gave up the ghost.</p>

<p id="id01091">42:023:047 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01092">42:023:048 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01093">42:023:049 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01094">42:023:050 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was a good man, and a just:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01095" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:023:051 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;)
           he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself
           waited for the kingdom of God.</p>

<p id="id01096">42:023:052 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</p>

<p id="id01097" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:023:053 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a
           sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was
           laid.</p>

<p id="id01098">42:023:054 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</p>

<p id="id01099">42:023:055 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01100">42:023:056 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01101" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:024:001 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,
           they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they
           had prepared, and certain others with them.</p>

<p id="id01102">42:024:002 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</p>

<p id="id01103">42:024:003 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p id="id01104" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:024:004 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout,
           behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</p>

<p id="id01105" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:024:005 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the
           earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the
           dead?</p>

<p id="id01106">42:024:006 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he was yet in Galilee,<br>
</p>

<p id="id01107">42:024:007 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01108">42:024:008 And they remembered his words,</p>

<p id="id01109" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:024:009 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things
           unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</p>

<p id="id01110" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:024:010 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of
           James, and other women that were with them, which told these
           things unto the apostles.</p>

<p id="id01111" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:024:011 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they
           believed them not.</p>

<p id="id01112">42:024:012 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01113">42:024:013 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;furlongs.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01114">42:024:014 And they talked together of all these things which had<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happened.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01115">42:024:015 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01116">42:024:016 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</p>

<p id="id01117" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:024:017 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these
           that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</p>

<p id="id01118">42:024:018 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known the things which are come to pass there in these days?<br>
</p>

<p id="id01119">42:024:019 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deed and word before God and all the people:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01120" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:024:020 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be
           condemned to death, and have crucified him.</p>

<p id="id01121" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:024:021 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed
           Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since
           these things were done.</p>

<p id="id01122" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:024:022 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,
           which were early at the sepulchre;</p>

<p id="id01123">42:024:023 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alive.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01124">42:024:024 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01125">42:024:025 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that the prophets have spoken:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01126">42:024:026 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into his glory?<br>
</p>

<p id="id01127">42:024:027 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01128">42:024:028 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made as though he would have gone further.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01129" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:024:029 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is
           toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to
           tarry with them.</p>

<p id="id01130">42:024:030 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01131">42:024:031 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of their sight.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01132">42:024:032 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us the scriptures?<br>
</p>

<p id="id01133">42:024:033 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them,<br>
</p>

<p id="id01134">42:024:034 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</p>

<p id="id01135">42:024:035 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known of them in breaking of bread.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01136">42:024:036 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01137">42:024:037 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had seen a spirit.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01138">42:024:038 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thoughts arise in your hearts?<br>
</p>

<p id="id01139" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:024:039 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me,
           and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me
           have.</p>

<p id="id01140">42:024:040 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feet.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01141">42:024:041 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them, Have ye here any meat?<br>
</p>

<p id="id01142">42:024:042 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honeycomb.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01143">42:024:043 And he took it, and did eat before them.</p>

<p id="id01144" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">42:024:044 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto
           you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be
           fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the
           prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</p>

<p id="id01145">42:024:045 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand<br>

</p>

<p id="id01147">42:024:047 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<br>

<p id="id01148">42:024:048 And ye are witnesses of these things.</p>

<p id="id01150">42:024:050 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his<br>

<p id="id01151">42:024:051 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from<br>

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
