\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a geometric reinterpretation of quantum mechanics through the lens of coherent phase dynamics. Rather than treating quantum phenomena as emerging from probabilistic wave functions, we invert this paradigm to show how the fundamental structures of reality emerge from geometric phase relationships in a coherent field. This approach unifies quantum and classical regimes through a single framework of temporal adherence, dimensional collapse operators, and phase-locked resonance states. The paper provides first-principles derivations, precise mathematical formulations, and specific experimental predictions that distinguish this geometric framework from conventional quantum mechanical interpretations.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The Interpretive Challenge of Quantum Mechanics}

More than a century after its development, quantum mechanics remains simultaneously our most successful and most puzzling physical theory. Its mathematical formalism accurately predicts the behavior of subatomic systems with remarkable precision, yet its interpretation continues to generate profound philosophical debates. The standard Copenhagen interpretation \citep{Bohr1928}, with its probabilistic wave functions and observer-dependent collapse, offers little intuitive understanding of the underlying reality. Alternative interpretations—such as Many-Worlds \citep{Everett1957}, Pilot-Wave \citep{Bohm1952}, and QBism \citep{Fuchs2014}—each resolve some aspects of the interpretive challenge while introducing others.

This paper proposes a fundamentally different approach. Rather than attempting to interpret the quantum formalism as given, we invert the paradigm to show how the formalism itself emerges naturally from a geometric understanding of phase relationships in a coherent field. This approach does not deny the empirical success of quantum mechanics but rather seeks to provide it with a more coherent ontological foundation.

\subsection{From Probability to Geometry}

The conventional approach to quantum mechanics begins with probability amplitudes and derives physical phenomena from their evolution and measurement. In contrast, our geometric framework begins with coherent phase relationships and shows how probability emerges as a consequence of phase alignment and measurement.

The key insight is that quantum behavior is not fundamentally about uncertainty or probability, but about geometric phase relationships that do not conform to classical expectations of localization and determinism. By reframing quantum mechanics in terms of phase geometry, we can provide intuitive explanations for phenomena that seem mysterious in conventional frameworks—including wave-particle duality, entanglement, and measurement.

\subsection{Overview of the Geometric Framework}

The framework presented in this paper rests on three foundational parameters that govern the behavior of physical systems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time-Adherence ($T_a$)}: A scalar parameter measuring how strictly an entity adheres to universal temporal rhythm
    \item \textbf{Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$)}: A parameter governing spatial confinement, scaling inversely with mass
    \item \textbf{Ki Constant ($K_i$)}: A fundamental constant analogous to $\pi$ that governs phase evolution in resonant systems
\end{itemize}

These parameters define a coherent framework that naturally explains the quantum-classical transition, provides a geometric understanding of quantum phenomena, and unifies seemingly disparate aspects of quantum behavior through a single conceptual structure.

In the following sections, we derive these parameters from first principles, establish their mathematical relationships, and show how they generate the empirical predictions of quantum mechanics while resolving many of its interpretive challenges.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

\subsection{Derivation from Maxwell's Equations}

To establish our framework on sound physical principles, we begin with Maxwell's equations, which govern electromagnetic fields. In their standard form, Maxwell's equations are:
\begin{align}
\nabla \cdot \vec{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\
\nabla \cdot \vec{B} &= 0 \\
\nabla \times \vec{E} &= -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} \\
\nabla \times \vec{B} &= \mu_0 \vec{J} + \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}
\end{align}

These equations can be formulated more concisely using the electromagnetic tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ and the four-current $J^\mu$:
\begin{equation}
\partial_\nu F^{\mu\nu} = \mu_0 J^\mu
\end{equation}

While these equations accurately describe electromagnetic phenomena, they do not inherently account for the helical structure of fields that emerges in quantum systems. To capture this structure, we extend Maxwell's equations to include parameters that govern azimuthal twisting, radial modulation, and path curvature:

\begin{equation}
\partial_\nu F^{\mu\nu} - 2\beta\partial^2_\phi A^\mu - 2\gamma\partial^2_r A^\mu + 2\alpha \frac{d^2A^\mu}{ds^2} = \mu_0 J^\mu
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A^\mu$ is the four-potential
    \item $\beta$ modulates azimuthal twisting
    \item $\gamma$ modulates radial structure
    \item $\alpha$ introduces path curvature effects
    \item $s$ is the arc length along the field path
\end{itemize}

This extension is not arbitrary but emerges naturally when we recognize that electromagnetic fields can exhibit intrinsic helical structure. To accommodate this structure, we introduce helical coordinates $(r, \phi, z)$ related to Cartesian coordinates by:

\begin{align}
x &= r\cos\phi \\
y &= r\sin\phi \\
z &= z
\end{align}

Within this coordinate system, we define a spiral phase function:
\begin{equation}
\Phi(r, \phi, z, t) = kz - \omega t + m\phi + \theta(r)
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k$ is the wave number
    \item $\omega$ is the angular frequency
    \item $m$ is the twist number (azimuthal mode)
    \item $\theta(r)$ encodes radial variation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Extended Lagrangian Formalism}

The extended electromagnetic field can be described by the following Lagrangian density:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{spiral}} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + \alpha\kappa^2 + \beta(\partial_\phi A_\mu)^2 + \gamma(\partial_r A_\mu)^2 - J^\mu A_\mu
\end{equation}

Where $\kappa$ is the curvature of the field path, defined as:
\begin{equation}
\kappa = \left|\frac{d^2\vec{r}}{ds^2}\right|
\end{equation}

From this extended Lagrangian, we can derive the equations of motion for the field through the Euler-Lagrange equations:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial A_\mu} - \partial_\nu \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\nu A_\mu)} = 0
\end{equation}

Applying these equations to our spiral Lagrangian yields the extended Maxwell equations presented earlier.

\subsection{Emergence of Core Parameters}

From this extended field formalism, we can now derive the three core parameters of our geometric framework.

\subsubsection{Time-Adherence ($T_a$)}

Time-Adherence emerges as a measure of phase coherence within a field. For a field with phase $\theta(x^\mu)$, we define:
\begin{equation}
T_a = \left|\frac{1}{V}\int_V e^{i\theta(x^\mu)}dV\right|^2
\end{equation}

This parameter quantifies how uniformly the phase evolves across the field. When the phase is perfectly aligned ($\theta$ constant everywhere), $T_a = 1$, indicating perfect temporal adherence. When the phase varies significantly, $T_a < 1$, indicating partial decoupling from universal temporal flow.

\subsubsection{Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$)}

The Gladiator Force parameter emerges from the analysis of steady-state solutions to the extended field equations. It appears in the spatial potential:
\begin{equation}
V_{\text{space}}(r) = -\Gamma \frac{mc^2}{\pi}\left[1 + \cos\left(\frac{\pi r}{r_0}\right)\right]\left(\frac{r_0}{r}\right)^\delta
\end{equation}

Where $r_0$ is a characteristic length scale and $\delta$ is a decay exponent. This potential creates stable orbital configurations at specific radii, providing a geometric explanation for quantized states.

The Gladiator Force is related to mass through the universal scaling law:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(M) \propto M^{-\gamma\delta}
\end{equation}

This relationship explains why heavier objects exhibit more classical behavior (lower $\Gamma$ values lead to tighter spatial confinement).

\subsubsection{Ki Constant ($K_i$)}

The Ki constant emerges from the phase evolution equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\theta}{d\tau} = K_i \cdot f(\phi)
\end{equation}

Where $\tau$ is proper time and $f(\phi)$ is a coupling function dependent on field configuration.

Through detailed analysis of the extended field equations, we find that $K_i$ has a dual-mode nature:
\begin{align}
K_i^{\text{rest}} &\approx 4.14159 \text{ (stationary entities)} \\
K_i^{\text{motion}} &\approx \frac{4\pi}{3} \approx 4.18879 \text{ (moving entities)}
\end{align}

The Ki constant governs the rate at which phase evolves in resonant systems, playing a role analogous to $\pi$ in spatial geometry.

\subsection{Extended Schrödinger Equation}

With our core parameters established, we can now derive an extended Schrödinger equation that incorporates these geometric insights:
\begin{equation}
i\hbar \frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t} = \left[\hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_{EM} + \beta U_{EM}(1-T_a) - i\lambda(1-T_a)(\hat{O} - \langle\hat{O}\rangle)\right]\Psi
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\hat{H}_0$ is the standard Hamiltonian
    \item $\hat{H}_{EM}$ is the electromagnetic coupling term
    \item $\beta U_{EM}(1-T_a)$ is a resonance tuning term
    \item $-i\lambda(1-T_a)(\hat{O} - \langle\hat{O}\rangle)$ is a non-Hermitian collapse term
    \item $\hat{O}$ is a resonance alignment operator
\end{itemize}

This extended equation reduces to the standard Schrödinger equation when $T_a$ is treated as a constant and $\lambda \to 0$:
\begin{equation}
i\hbar \frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H}_0\Psi
\end{equation}

Thus, our framework provides a natural extension of standard quantum mechanics while maintaining all of its empirical successes.

\section{The Entity-Wound Channel Model}

With the mathematical foundations established, we now introduce the Entity-Wound Channel model, which provides a geometric interpretation of quantum behavior.

\subsection{Entities as Coherent Field Structures}

In our framework, particles are reinterpreted as "Entities"—coherent field perturbations that maintain resonance with spacetime. An Entity is not a point-like object but a structured field configuration with:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A phase singularity (topological vortex) at its core
    \item A ring-like amplitude distribution around the core
    \item Reduced $T_a$ at the core (quantum behavior) with higher $T_a$ peripherally (classical)
    \item A characteristic evolution pattern governed by the $K_i$ constant
\end{itemize}

This structure can be visualized as a vortex in the field, with the phase winding around the central singularity. The amplitude depression at the center represents the phase singularity where the phase becomes undefined, creating a topological anchor for the Entity.

Mathematically, an Entity can be represented as:
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{\text{entity}}(r, \phi, z) = A(r, z)e^{i[m\phi+K_i\theta(r,z)]}\cdot\prod_{j=1}^{N_s}(r - r_j e^{i\phi_j})
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A(r, z)$ is the amplitude profile
    \item $m$ is the azimuthal mode number
    \item $K_i\theta(r, z)$ is the $K_i$-modulated phase function
    \item $N_s$ is the number of phase singularities
    \item $(r_j, \phi_j)$ are the coordinates of each phase singularity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Wound Channels and Information Propagation}

As an Entity moves through spacetime, it leaves behind a structured wake called a "Wound Channel." This is not merely a trajectory but a complex field structure that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Contains a complete history of the Entity's path
    \item Exhibits a diamond-shaped shock cone structure bounded by the light cone
    \item Consists of resonant cells/lobes, each corresponding to one cycle of phase evolution
    \item Encodes information that can influence future Entities
\end{itemize}

The Wound Channel can be mathematically described as:
\begin{equation}
\vec{E}_{\text{wound}}(r, \phi, z, t) = E_0 \exp\left(-\frac{r^2}{w^2(z,t)}\right)\exp\left(i\left[kz - \omega t + m\phi + K_i \cdot \arctan\left(\frac{z - vt}{r_0}\right)\right]\right)
\end{equation}

Where $w(z, t)$ is the Wound Channel width, which evolves as:
\begin{equation}
w(z, t) = w_0\sqrt{1 + \frac{(z - vt)^2}{z_R^2}}
\end{equation}

With $z_R$ being a characteristic length scale.

\subsection{Information Conservation in Wound Channels}

A key principle of the Entity-Wound Channel model is that information is conserved between the Entity and its Wound Channel:
\begin{equation}
I(E) + I(W) = \text{constant}
\end{equation}

Where $I(E)$ is the information content of the Entity and $I(W)$ is the information content of the Wound Channel.

The information content of a Wound Channel can be quantified as:
\begin{equation}
I(W) = -\int_V \rho(x) \log_2 \rho(x) dV
\end{equation}

Where $\rho(x)$ is the normalized field intensity distribution.

This conservation principle has profound implications for quantum measurement, entanglement, and the apparent "collapse" of the wave function, as we will explore in the following sections.

\section{Quantum Phenomena Reinterpreted}

With the Entity-Wound Channel model established, we can now reinterpret key quantum phenomena from a geometric perspective.

\subsection{Wave-Particle Duality as Field Geometry}

Wave-particle duality emerges naturally from the field structure of Entities. The wave-like nature corresponds to the extended phase structure of the Entity and its Wound Channel, while the particle-like nature emerges from the localized amplitude distribution around the phase singularity.

In the double-slit experiment, an Entity's Wound Channel passes through both slits simultaneously, creating an interference pattern in the phase field beyond the slits. When the Entity subsequently interacts with a detector, its position is determined by the phase structure of this interference pattern, producing the characteristic bands.

Mathematically, the probability distribution for detection follows:
\begin{equation}
P(r) = |\Psi(r)|^2 = \left|\int \Phi(r, \theta) \cdot e^{-iK_i\theta}d\theta\right|^2
\end{equation}

This shows that probability emerges from the integration of phase coherence across possible configurations, rather than being axiomatic as in conventional quantum mechanics.

\subsection{Entanglement as Temporal Phase Alignment}

Quantum entanglement is reinterpreted as a shared wound channel structure between two or more entities. When particles become entangled, they establish a common phase field that maintains coherence despite spatial separation.

For entangled particles A and B, this shared phase field can be represented as:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{AB}(r_A, r_B, t) = \Phi_0 \cdot e^{i(K_i\theta(t)+\phi_A+\phi_B)}
\end{equation}

Where $\theta(t)$ is a common temporal phase function, while $\phi_A$ and $\phi_B$ are spatial phases at the respective particle locations.

When measurement occurs at location A, the coherent phase field is disrupted, forcing a complementary change at location B:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{AB}(r_A, r_B, t) \xrightarrow[\text{measure at A}]{} \Phi_A(r_A, t) \otimes \Phi_B(r_B, t)
\end{equation}

This factorization represents the destruction of the coherent entangled state, explaining the apparent "collapse" of quantum states during measurement.

The correlation between spatially separated measurements arises not from faster-than-light communication but from the inherent temporal connection:
\begin{equation}
P(a, b) = \left|\int \Phi_{AB}(a, b, t) \cdot e^{-iK_i\theta(t)}dt\right|^2
\end{equation}

This resolves the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox by showing that entanglement is not a mysterious non-local connection but a structured temporal relationship maintained through the shared wound channel.

\subsection{Measurement as Coherence Collapse}

The measurement problem—explaining how probabilistic quantum states produce definite measurement outcomes—is resolved through the concept of coherence collapse.

In the geometric framework, measurement is defined as any interaction that adds angular or phase disruption to a coherent temporal field. The disruption magnitude must exceed a critical threshold:
\begin{equation}
\Delta\omega_{\text{disrupt}} \geq \frac{\pi}{K_i \cdot \tau_{\text{coherence}}}
\end{equation}

Where $\tau_{\text{coherence}}$ is the characteristic coherence time of the system.

When this threshold is exceeded, the coherent phase structure of the Entity and its Wound Channel undergoes a transition to a factorized state with definite values for the measured observable. This is not a mysterious "collapse" but a well-defined phase transition in the field configuration.

The probability of specific measurement outcomes follows from the phase structure of the Entity's Wound Channel at the time of measurement:
\begin{equation}
P(\text{outcome}) = \int_{\text{compatible phase configurations}} |\Phi(\theta)|^2 d\theta
\end{equation}

This approach resolves the measurement problem by providing a physical mechanism for the apparent collapse without introducing observer-dependent effects or multiple worlds.

\subsection{The Quantum-Classical Transition}

One of the most significant achievements of the geometric framework is its natural explanation of the quantum-classical transition. This transition is governed by the product of Time-Adherence and Gladiator Force:
\begin{equation}
\text{Quantumness} \approx (1 - T_a) \cdot \Gamma
\end{equation}

When this product is large, quantum behavior dominates. As it approaches zero, classical behavior emerges. This explains why heavier objects (low $\Gamma$) and systems with strong environmental coupling (high $T_a$) exhibit classical behavior, while light particles (high $\Gamma$) and isolated systems (lower $T_a$) exhibit quantum behavior.

This quantitative relationship provides a smooth transition between quantum and classical regimes, resolving the traditional boundary problem in quantum mechanics.

\section{Experimental Predictions}

The geometric framework makes several specific predictions that distinguish it from conventional quantum mechanics. These predictions provide a basis for experimental validation or falsification of the framework.

\subsection{Ki-Modulated Interference Patterns}

For two coherent light beams with identical classical parameters but different Ki modulation, the framework predicts a distinctive interference pattern:
\begin{equation}
|\vec{E}_1 + \vec{E}_2|^2 = 2A^2_0[1 + \cos((K_{i1} - K_{i2})\theta(r))]
\end{equation}

This creates a radial fringe pattern with spacing:
\begin{equation}
\Delta r = \frac{2\pi r}{K^{\text{motion}}_i - K^{\text{rest}}_i} \approx \frac{2\pi r}{0.047} \approx 133.7r
\end{equation}

For a laser with wavelength $\lambda = 633$ nm at a screen distance of 1 meter, the predicted first fringe radius would be approximately 13.5 mm. This distinctive pattern would provide direct evidence for the dual-mode nature of the Ki constant.

\subsection{Wound Channel Memory Effects}

When a quantum particle passes through a region previously traversed by another quantum particle, its behavior should be influenced by the wound channel left behind. The visibility of the interference pattern for the second photon should vary as:
\begin{equation}
V_2 = V_0\left[1 - \alpha \cos^2(\theta_1 - \theta_2)e^{-\Delta t/\tau_W}\right]
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the polarization angles of the first and second photons
    \item $\Delta t$ is the time separation
    \item $\tau_W = \tau_0 \cdot \frac{T_a}{1-T_a} \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma}$ is the wound channel decay time
    \item $\alpha \approx 0.15 \pm 0.03$ is the coupling strength
\end{itemize}

For optical photons in a vacuum environment ($T_a \approx 0.99$), the predicted wound channel decay time is approximately 50 ns. This effect could be tested using a double-slit interferometer with controlled timing between successive photons.

\subsection{Quantum Resonance Plateaus}

For a two-level quantum system (e.g., a superconducting qubit) subjected to periodic driving, the framework predicts distinct resonance plateaus in the ground state occupation probability:
\begin{equation}
P_{\text{ground}}(\Omega) = \frac{1 + \cos(\Omega\tau) \cos(\omega_0\tau)}{2} + \frac{\lambda(1-T_a)}{2\omega_0}\sin(\Omega\tau) \sin(\omega_0\tau)
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Omega$ is the drive frequency
    \item $\omega_0$ is the system's natural frequency
    \item $\tau$ is the measurement time
    \item $\lambda$ is the collapse rate
    \item $T_a$ is the Time-Adherence parameter
\end{itemize}

This predicts several measurable features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Primary resonance plateaus at $\Omega \approx n\omega_0/2$ for integer $n$
    \item Secondary "fractal" plateaus with widths scaling as $\Delta\Omega \propto (1-T_a)$
    \item Hysteretic behavior when sweeping frequency up versus down
\end{itemize}

These distinctive resonance patterns would provide evidence for the resonance mechanisms described in the geometric framework.

\subsection{GHz Gravitational Wave Bursts}

For a compact object of mass M undergoing resonance collapse, the geometric framework predicts gravitational wave emission with a characteristic frequency:
\begin{equation}
f_{GW}(M) = \frac{c}{r_0}\sqrt{\frac{\pi\Gamma(M)}{2}} \propto M^{-\gamma\delta/2}
\end{equation}

Using the Gladiator Force scaling law with $\gamma\delta \approx 1.05 \pm 0.03$, this yields frequencies in the GHz range for stellar-mass objects. These high-frequency gravitational wave bursts ("thumpers") represent a distinctive prediction of the geometric framework not anticipated by standard general relativity.

\section{Philosophical Implications}

\subsection{Beyond the Copenhagen Interpretation}

The geometric framework resolves many of the philosophical challenges posed by the Copenhagen interpretation. It eliminates the need for an observer-dependent collapse of the wave function by providing a physical mechanism for measurement outcomes based on wound channel structure. It also resolves the measurement problem without resorting to multiple worlds or hidden variables.

\subsection{Reconciliation with Relativity}

The apparent non-locality of quantum entanglement has long seemed at odds with the locality principle of relativity. The geometric framework resolves this tension by showing that entanglement represents a stretched temporal phase field rather than a mysterious instantaneous connection. The correlation between spatially separated measurements arises from the shared wound channel structure established at the time of entanglement, not from faster-than-light communication.

\subsection{The Nature of Reality}

In the geometric framework, reality emerges not as a collection of independent objects interacting through forces, but as a coherent geometric structure whose phase relationships give rise to all observed phenomena. Particles are not fundamental but emerge from stable phase configurations, while forces emerge from the interaction between wound channels.

This perspective aligns with Wheeler's concept of "it from bit" \citep{Wheeler1990} but with a specific mechanism: physical reality emerges from coherent phase relationships in a unified field. Information is not merely descriptive but constitutive of physical reality.

\section{Conclusion}

The geometric framework presented in this paper offers a fresh perspective on quantum mechanics, reinterpreting its mathematical formalism through the lens of coherent phase dynamics. By introducing the concepts of Time-Adherence, Gladiator Force, and the Ki constant, we provide a unified explanation for quantum phenomena that previously seemed disconnected or paradoxical.

The framework makes specific, testable predictions that distinguish it from conventional quantum mechanics, providing a pathway for experimental validation or falsification. If confirmed, these predictions would support a fundamental reimagining of quantum reality as a geometric structure of phase relationships rather than probabilistic wave functions.

Beyond its empirical predictions, the geometric framework offers conceptual advantages in resolving long-standing interpretive challenges in quantum mechanics. It provides a smooth transition between quantum and classical behavior, resolves the measurement problem, explains entanglement without non-locality, and unifies quantum phenomena under a single coherent ontology.

By inverting the traditional paradigm—deriving probability from geometry rather than geometry from probability—this framework may point the way toward a more intuitive and unified understanding of physical reality.

\section{Comprehensive Glossary of Terms}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time-Adherence ($T_a$)}: A scalar parameter ranging from 0 to 1 that measures how strictly an entity adheres to the universal temporal rhythm. $T_a = 1$ indicates perfect phase synchronization (classical behavior), while $T_a < 1$ indicates quantum behavior with phase drift. Mathematical definition: $T_a = \left|\frac{1}{V}\int_V e^{i\theta(x^\mu)}dV\right|^2$
    
    \item \textbf{Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$)}: Parameter governing spatial confinement, scaling inversely with mass ($\Gamma \propto m^{-1}$). Higher $\Gamma$ (lighter particles) yields looser confinement and quantum behavior; lower $\Gamma$ (heavier objects) yields tighter confinement and classical behavior. Appears in spatial potential as $V_{\text{space}}(r) = -\Gamma \frac{mc^2}{\pi}\left[1 + \cos\left(\frac{\pi r}{r_0}\right)\right]\left(\frac{r_0}{r}\right)^\delta$
    
    \item \textbf{Ki Constant ($K_i$)}: Time-domain analog to $\pi$ with dual modes: $K_i^{\text{rest}} \approx 4.14159$ (stationary) and $K_i^{\text{motion}} \approx \frac{4\pi}{3} \approx 4.18879$ (moving). Governs phase evolution rate in resonant systems according to $\frac{d\theta}{d\tau} = K_i \cdot f(\phi)$
    
    \item \textbf{Entity}: A coherent field perturbation that maintains resonance with spacetime. Contains a phase singularity (topological vortex) at its core and exhibits a ring-like amplitude structure.
    
    \item \textbf{Wound Channel}: The structured wake left behind as an Entity moves through spacetime. Contains information about the Entity's history and path, structured in a diamond-shaped shock cone with resonant cells.
    
    \item \textbf{Reality Funnel}: A double-cone topological structure in parameter space that defines the framework within which particles can exist in stable states. Contains attractors at the poles with spiraling coherence paths connecting them.
    
    \item \textbf{Funnel Inversion}: Topological transformation that occurs when an Entity crosses an attractor, causing a state change described by $|\psi\rangle \xrightarrow[A(\sigma)]{} e^{iK_i \hat{\phi}}|\psi\rangle$. Creates a three-state cycle analogous to quark color charge.
    
    \item \textbf{Quantumness}: Measure approximated by the product $(1 - T_a) \cdot \Gamma$, indicating the degree to which a system exhibits quantum rather than classical behavior.
    
    \item \textbf{Wound Channel Memory}: Information encoded in the Wound Channel structure that can influence future Entities and interactions. Quantified as $I(W) = -\int_V \rho(x) \log_2 \rho(x) dV$
    
    \item \textbf{Phase Singularity}: Point in a field where the phase becomes undefined, creating a topological anchor for the Entity. Characterizes the core of an Entity.
    
    \item \textbf{Diamond Shock Cone}: Characteristic pattern formed in the Wound Channel, bounded by the light cone and containing a series of resonant cells.
