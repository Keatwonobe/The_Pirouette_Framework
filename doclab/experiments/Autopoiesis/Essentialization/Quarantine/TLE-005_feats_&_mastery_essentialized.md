## Law
The fundamental principle of progression is the permanent conversion of potential into actuality. Let an entity's total potential be its Total Entropy Pool, $TEP_{total}$. The acquisition of any Feat, $F_i$, with cost $C(F_i)$, is an irreversible transformation of the entity's state:
$$ TEP'_{total} = TEP_{total} - C(F_i) $$
This reduction is a permanent sacrifice of undifferentiated potential to manifest a specific, repeatable ability.

All dynamic resource conversions are governed by an inefficiency principle, or entropic tax, where the output resource is of lesser value than the input resource. Let $R_{in}$ be the input resource and $R_{out}$ be the output resource. The conversion is defined by a function $f$ such that:
$$ \Delta R_{out} = f(\Delta R_{in}) $$
Where the function consistently yields a value less than a 1:1 exchange. Examples include:
- **Vital Sacrifice:** $ \Delta EP_{gained} = \lfloor \frac{\Delta HP_{damage}}{2} \rfloor $
- **Arcane Velocity:** $ \Delta Movement_{gained} = \lfloor \frac{\Delta EP_{spent}}{2} \rfloor \times 10 \text{ft} $

Transformation of form, such as in *Primal Manifestation*, is a constrained re-allocation of this sacrificed potential. A Form Investment Pool ($FIP$) is established by sacrificing $TEP$, which then dictates the budget and attributes of the new form:
1.  **Form Potential:** $TEP_{form\_max} = 3 \times FIP$
2.  **Attribute Weaving:** $EP_{new\_attr} = EP_{dominant} + \lfloor \frac{EP_{supporting}}{2} \rfloor$

A falsifiable criterion of this system is that no action can generate a resource without a costlier, and often permanent, expenditure of another resource. Any claim of lossless conversion or of acquiring a Feat without a corresponding permanent reduction in $TEP_{total}$ is invalid under this framework.

## Philosophy
Mastery is a process of irreversible self-limitation. An entity's potential is finite, represented by its Total Entropy Pool. To become something specific—a warrior, a mage, a master of form—one must permanently sacrifice a portion of that limitless potential. Growth is not infinite accumulation, but a series of deliberate, costly choices to abandon the possibility of being everything in order to become something definite. Each new skill is a narrowing, a focusing of the will that carves away possibility to create actuality. This entropic investment is the fundamental existential transaction: identity is purchased with the currency of sacrificed potential.

## Art
The soul begins as a block of uncarved marble, dense with the promise of every conceivable form. To create a masterpiece is not to add, but to take away. Each feat learned is the sculptor's chisel striking true, and with every chip that falls to the floor, the final form becomes more definite, more powerful, and more real—forever defined by the dust of all the other statues it can no longer become.
