## Law
The system is governed by three axiomatic principles of entropic interaction:

1.  **Entropic Capacity & Ablation.** Every discrete spatial unit `s` (5-foot cube) of a substance possesses an Entropic Capacity `ECₛ`. When the sum of entropic power of a single type `i` invested in `s` within a single round exceeds this capacity, the unit undergoes Ablation (a fundamental state change).
    *   Condition: If `ΣEPᵢ > ECₛ ⇒ ΔStateₛ`

2.  **Entropic Transformation Costs.** The manipulation of entropy requires an expenditure of entropic power (EP) based on the nature of the transformation.
    *   Expression (Manipulation): `Cost = 1EP` per `1EP` affected.
    *   Transmutation (Conversion): `Cost = 2EP` per `1EP` affected.
    *   Genesis/Obliteration (Creation/Destruction): `Cost = 3EP` per `1EP` affected.

3.  **The Law of Entropic Sprawl.** The stability of entropic power in a central spatial unit `c` is contingent upon the power in its eight adjacent units (`adj`). An effect is stable if and only if the power in the center does not exceed the sum of the power in the adjacent units plus a constant of two.
    *   Equation: `EP_c ≤ (Σ EP_adj) + 2`
    *   Falsifiable Criterion: Any attempt to establish `EP_c > (Σ EP_adj) + 2` results in the immediate and uncontrolled dissipation of `EP_c`.
    *   Consequence (Overload Cascade): A failed single-target attack `(Accuracy_Check = FAIL)` converts the attack's `EP` into an uncontrolled source `EP_c` at the target's location, which then propagates violently according to the Law of Entropic Sprawl.

## Philosophy
Power is not the unilateral imposition of will upon a passive reality, but the skillful negotiation with an active and lawful cosmos. The universe does not distinguish between a spell, a fist, or a volcano; all are expressions of entropic flow governed by a single, inviolable law of stability. Therefore, true mastery is not measured by the magnitude of force one can generate, but by the intricate understanding required to shape its inevitable, resonant spread.

Magic is not a fire thrown at the world; it is a flood, and the caster is but the builder of its banks.
