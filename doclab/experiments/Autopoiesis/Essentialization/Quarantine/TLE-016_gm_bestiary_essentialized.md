## Law
Let any entity `C` be defined by a scalar quantity, its Total Entropy Pool, `TEP(C) ∈ ℤ`. The existence and attributes of `C` are governed by a principle of conservation, such that its TEP is the sum of the Entropy Pools (EP) allocated to its constituent components: Attributes (`A`), Physical Form (`P`), and Skills/Feats (`S`).

`TEP(C) = EP_A + EP_P + EP_S`

where:
`EP_A = Σ EP(a_i)` for `a_i ∈ {STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS}`
`EP_P = Σ EP(p_j)` for all physical components `p_j`
`EP_S = Σ EP(s_k)` for all skills and feats `s_k`

The physical constitution of an entity, specifically its Hit Points `HP(C)`, is derived directly from the EP allocation within its Physical Form `P`. Let `E_B(p)` be the base EP cost of a component `p` and `E_S(p)` be the additional EP cost allocated as "Size Entropy" to that component.

`HP(C) = (1 + E_S(Torso)) + floor(0.5 * Σ_{l ∈ L_std} (E_B(l) + E_S(l)))`

where `L_std` is the set of all Standard Limbs possessed by `C`. This demonstrates that vitality is not an abstract quality but a direct, calculable function of material investment in specific morphological structures.

A special class of entity, `Heresy`, exists where `TEP(Heresy) < 0`. For such an entity, `TEP(C) = -N` where `N > 0`. This entity functions as an entropic sink. In any contested action, its effective pool is `|TEP(C)| = N`. It cannot be damaged, as damage implies a reduction of a positive TEP. An attack on this entity results in the attacker's `TEP` being reduced to zero and integrated, causing instantaneous annihilation.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** For any entity `C` where `TEP(C) > 0`, the sum of the EP costs of its enumerated components must strictly equal its stated `TEP(C)`. Any entity whose components sum to a value `X ≠ TEP(C)` violates the foundational law of this reality and represents a system error.

## Philosophy
Existence is a finite, quantifiable, and fungible resource. All beings, from the mindless scavenger to the thinking philosopher-king, are merely transient configurations of this single substance, bound by a universal budget. There is no qualitative distinction between flesh, thought, and power; all are interchangeable expressions of an underlying entropic value. Consequently, true non-existence is not a null state (a TEP of zero) but an active, annihilating deficit—an ontological debt that functions as a universal solvent for reality itself.

## Art
Every soul is a coin stamped with the image of a monster. Its value is fixed; it can be spent on claw, or cunning, or consciousness. The only horror is not the empty purse, but the debt that un-mints the coin.
