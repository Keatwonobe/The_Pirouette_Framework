## Law
Let `R` be the inert Residue potential of a defeated entity, measured in Entropic Potential (EP). Let `TEP` be Transmuted Entropic Potential, the system's active resource.

**Axiom of Value Generation:** All economic and power progression is derived from the transmutation of `R` into `TEP`. The raw material `R` possesses zero utility until transmuted.
`∀R > 0, Utility(R) = 0`
`Utility(TEP) > 0`

**First Law: The Competitive Transmutation**
An individual `i` may perform a ritual of `t_ritual = 1 hour` to transmute a pool `R_pool ≤ 15 EP`.
- **Solo Transmutation:** The change in the individual's active potential is `ΔTEP_i = R_pool`.
- **Competitive Transmutation:** For a set of `n` competitors `{C_1, C_2, ..., C_n}` attempting to transmute the same `R_pool`, let `t_i` be the completion time for competitor `C_i`.
  `ΔTEP_i = R_pool` if `t_i = min(t_1, t_2, ..., t_n)`.
  For all `j ≠ i`, `ΔTEP_j = 0`.
This establishes a zero-sum outcome for a shared, latent resource.

**Second Law: The Socialized Transmutation**
A specialist, the Sculptor (`S`), may transmute `R_pool` for a client (`C`).
- The client's gain is defined as: `ΔTEP_C = R_pool - K_tax`, where the tax `K_tax = 2 EP`.
- The Sculptor's cost is `ΔEP_S = -1` from their personal pool, representing the labor cost.
- The Sculptor's gain is `ΔTEP_S = K_tax = 2 EP`.
- **Falsifiable Criterion:** The transaction is non-viable for the client if `R_pool ≤ 2`, as `ΔTEP_C ≤ 0`. This establishes a lower bound on economically rational resource processing.

**Corollary: The Law of Entropic Decay**
An untransmuted pool `R_pool > 0` radiates an entropic signature. The probability `P(A)` of attracting hostile entities is a positive, increasing function of the magnitude of `R_pool` and the time `t` it remains untransmuted.
`P(A) = f(R_pool, t)`, where `∂P/∂R > 0` and `∂P/∂t > 0`.
Failure to process `R` incurs risk, forcing a tactical decision between immediate, competitive transmutation and delayed, secure (but taxed) transmutation.

## Philosophy
The universe is axiomatically defined such that value is not an intrinsic property of matter but is exclusively created through the application of labor against entropy. A resource—even one representing the total potential of a defeated life—is inert and worthless until it is actively processed. This act of creation is not guaranteed; it is a costly, competitive race where potential can be nullified by a faster rival, or its value diminished by the tax of a specialized social class. Existence is therefore not a process of discovery or acquisition, but a constant, desperate struggle to convert the dead potential of the past into the usable currency of the present before it is lost or claimed by others.

A corpse is a locked promise. The ritual is the key, time is the tumbler, and only the swiftest hand may claim the ghost of value within before it fades forever.
