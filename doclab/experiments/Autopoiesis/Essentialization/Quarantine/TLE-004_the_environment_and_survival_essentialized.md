## Law
Let total entropic potential be TEP, a permanent measure of a being's metaphysical mass. Let the transient entropic pool be EP, with an Entropy Regeneration Rate (ERR). The environment of any given region possesses an Entropy Budget, `E_env`, estimated as 45,000 EP per sentient inhabitant per day. All actions are entropic transactions.

1.  **The Law of Environmental Corruption:** For any magical effect not classified as natural shaping, the change in the local environmental budget is directly and negatively proportional to the expenditure.
    `ΔE_env = -0.5 * EP_spent`
    This change is localized to the 5x5 cube of the effect's origin. This is a falsifiable principle: sustained non-natural magic in a region must demonstrably reduce its `E_env`.

2.  **The Law of Material Creation:** The creation of matter from raw entropy follows a linear cost function. The cost `C` to create a volume `V` of a simple element is:
    `C = 5 * (L/5) * (W/5) * (H/5)` where `L, W, H` are the dimensions in feet.

3.  **The Law of Contested Will:** Control over any 5-foot environmental zone `Z` is determined by the maximum invested EP. Let Caster A and Caster B invest `EP_A` and `EP_B` respectively into `Z`.
    `Control(Z) = Actor_i` where `EP_i = max(EP_A, EP_B)`
    If `EP_A = EP_B`, the zone becomes `Contested`, a state of nullified control and chaotic effect.

4.  **The Law of Entropic Overload:** A character can safely channel power from enchanted items up to a defined limit.
    Let `TEP_char` be the character's total entropic potential.
    Let `ΣTEP_items` be the sum of the TEP costs of all attuned items.
    The Overload Limit `L_O = 2 * TEP_char`.
    If `ΣTEP_items > L_O`, the character is Overloaded by `Δ_O = ΣTEP_items - L_O`.
    Upon using any item's ability, the character must test for catastrophic loss:
    Roll `d(C_item)`, where `C_item` is the used item's EP cost.
    If `Result <= Δ_O`, then `ΔTEP_char = -Result`. This loss is permanent. Falsifiable criterion: a character exceeding their `L_O` must be subject to this probabilistic permanent loss of self.

5.  **The Law of Survival as Combat:** The environment is a combatant whose attributes and health pools are derived from its `E_env`. A survival encounter is an initiative-based contest where the environment "attacks" a character's attribute pools (STR, DEX, INT, WIS), and failure results in a direct loss of EP. Success is defined as overcoming these challenges to acquire resources, representing a transfer of EP from the environment's budget to the character.

## Philosophy
Existence is a closed, entropic economy. There is no qualitative distinction between swinging a sword, casting a spell, surviving a blizzard, building a fortress, or creating life; they are all merely different forms of metabolic combat. Every act of will is a quantifiable transaction in the universal currency of being, and to persist is to perpetually fight a war of attrition against the unified hostility of a world that seeks to reclaim your budget.

## Art
The universe is a cavern of infinite, hungry dark. Every soul is a candle, its potential measured in wax, its will a flickering flame. And every act—a prayer, a sword-stroke, a thought—is the sputtering cost of light against the inevitable.
