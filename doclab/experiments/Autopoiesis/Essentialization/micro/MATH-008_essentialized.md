## Law
Time-Adherence `T_a` is a functional that quantifies a system's coherence as a signal-to-noise ratio. For an observed path `φ(t)` and its ideal periodic orbit `φ*(t)` with period `τ_p`, `T_a` is defined as the ratio of power in the fundamental mode to the total power:
`T_a[φ] := P[φ*] / P[φ]`, where `P[x] = (1/τ_p) ∫₀^(τ_p) |x(t)|² dt`.
By definition, `0 ≤ T_a ≤ 1`.

The system's dynamics under environmental noise `η(t)` are governed by a Langevin-type stochastic differential equation (SDE):
`dφ/dt = f(φ) + σ(φ)η(t)`
Here, `f(φ)` is the deterministic drift term derived from the system's potential `V`, `f(φ) = -∂V/∂φ`, and `η(t)` is a white noise process where `⟨η(t)⟩ = 0` and `⟨η(t)η(t')⟩ = δ(t-t')`.

The **Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem** establishes the relationship between coherence degradation, `ΔT_a := 1 - T_a`, and the noise spectrum. For a system near its stable orbit, linear response theory yields:
`ΔT_a ∝ ∫₀^∞ S_η(ω)|χ(ω)|² dω`
where:
- `S_η(ω)` is the power spectral density of the environmental noise `η(t)`.
- `χ(ω)` is the system's complex susceptibility, representing its linear response to perturbations at frequency `ω`. It is determined by the system's intrinsic dynamics (`f(φ)`).

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The theorem predicts that for a given integrated noise power `∫S_η(ω)dω`, the degradation of coherence `ΔT_a` will be maximized when the spectral profile of the noise `S_η(ω)` is concentrated at frequencies where the system's susceptibility `|χ(ω)|` is highest. A system subjected to monochromatic noise of varying frequencies should exhibit maximum coherence loss when the noise frequency matches one of the system's natural resonant frequencies.

## Philosophy
The integrity of a system is not an intrinsic property determined by its static composition, but a relational, dynamic process of filtering. Stability is not a measure of strength against a singular overwhelming force, but a statistical measure of a system's ability to distinguish its own resonant signal from the ceaseless noise of its environment. A system fails not when it is broken, but when its internal pattern becomes computationally indistinguishable from the chaos it inhabits.

## Art
A bell is not defined by the bronze from which it is cast, but by the one pure note it can hold against the chaos of the wind.
