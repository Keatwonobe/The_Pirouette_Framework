## Law
The stability of a system at the boundary between two temporal media is governed by the **Coherence Ratio (ζ)**, a dimensionless local quantity. A system maintains its resonant integrity if and only if its intrinsic binding energy exceeds the destabilizing energy from chiral dissonance.

The governing equation is:
$$
\zeta(\mathbf x) = \frac{\Delta\kappa(\mathbf x)\cdot\Gamma(\mathbf x)}{\hbar\cdot\omega_c(\mathbf x)}
$$
Where:
*   $\Delta\kappa(\mathbf x) = |\kappa_1 - \kappa_0|$ is the **Chiral Differential**, the absolute difference in the temporal Gyre (κ) at the interaction point $\mathbf x$.
*   $\Gamma(\mathbf x)$ is the **Temporal Pressure**, the localized energy density of the interaction.
*   $\omega_c(\mathbf x)$ is the system's **Characteristic Coherence Frequency**, defined by its weakest resonant mode.

The **Coherence Criterion** establishes a binary, universal outcome:
1.  **ζ < 1 (Coherence):** The system's internal binding ($\hbar\omega_c$) is sufficient to overcome the chiral tension ($\Delta\kappa\cdot\Gamma$). The system persists, forming a stable resonant state (a Ki-species).
2.  **ζ > 1 (Decoherence):** Chiral tension overwhelms the system's binding. The system undergoes a **Decoherence Cascade**, dissolving into lower-coherence radiation.

This principle is falsifiable via three primary predictions:
*   **Homogeneity of Matter:** The observed "particle zoo" is a local Ki-species with a common κ. Matter from a region with a sufficiently different κ would be fundamentally unstable in our environment (ζ >> 1), precluding its stable observation.
*   **CMB Anisotropy:** Primordial chiral friction between regions of differing κ under the immense temporal pressure (Γ) of the Big Bang would produce decoherence cascades, whose thermal remnants are observable as anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background.
*   **High-Energy Decay Anomalies:** Particle collisions generating extreme local Γ can artificially induce ζ > 1 for known stable particles, forcing them into novel decay paths not predicted by the Standard Model.

## Philosophy
Existence is not an intrinsic property but a relational achievement. A thing *is* only insofar as its internal coherence continuously overcomes the external dissonance at its boundary. To be is to successfully resonate against the perpetual threat of dissolution.

## Art
A song is not the sound it makes, but the silence it holds at bay.
