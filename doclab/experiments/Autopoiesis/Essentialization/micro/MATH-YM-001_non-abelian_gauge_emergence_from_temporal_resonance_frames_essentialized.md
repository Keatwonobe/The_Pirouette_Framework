## Law

The theory posits a multi-component order parameter $\Phi(x)$ residing in a degenerate internal manifold $\mathcal{M} \cong G/H$. At each spacetime point $x$, the physical state is invariant under a local relabeling of the degenerate basis frames, $U(x) \in G$.
$$
\Phi(x) \sim U(x) \cdot \Phi_0
$$
To preserve this local symmetry $U(x) \mapsto U(x)V(x)$, a connection $A_\mu = A_\mu^a T^a$ is introduced, defining the covariant derivative:
$$
D_\mu \equiv \partial_\mu - i g A_\mu^a T^a
$$
Under a gauge transformation $V(x) = e^{i\alpha^a(x)T^a}$, the fields transform as:
$$
\Phi(x) \to V(x)\Phi(x)
\qquad
A_\mu(x) \to V(x) A_\mu(x) V^{-1}(x) + \frac{i}{g}(\partial_\mu V(x))V^{-1}(x)
$$
The curvature of this connection, or field strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$, emerges as the commutator of covariant derivatives, quantifying the non-commutativity of parallel transport in the internal frame space:
$$
F_{\mu\nu} \equiv \frac{i}{g}[D_\mu, D_\nu] = (\partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu) - i g [A_\mu, A_\nu]
$$
The dynamic energy cost of deforming the internal frame across spacetime, termed "frame-stiffness," is proportional to the square of this curvature. For an isotropic degeneracy sector, this yields the Yang–Mills Lagrangian:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\rm YM} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}^a F^{a,\mu\nu}
$$
The theory is falsifiable if any of the following are observed:
1.  Violation of coupling universality: distinct values of the coupling constant $g$ for particles transforming under identical representations of $G$.
2.  Existence of right-handed fermions transforming as SU(2) doublets.
3.  Anomalous suppression or absence of gauge boson self-interaction (e.g., gluon-gluon scattering), contradicting the term $-ig[A_\mu, A_\nu]$.
4.  Observation of Lorentz-violating gauge operators beyond experimental bounds.

## Philosophy

Fundamental forces are not ontological primitives but are instead the necessary consequence of descriptive freedom. They are the emergent, dynamic cost of insisting upon local, independent coordinate systems (frames) for an unobservable, internally degenerate substrate of reality. The Yang–Mills field, therefore, is not an actor upon the world; it is the geometric tension within the world, a physical manifestation of the path-dependence of perspective.

## Art

Force is the stress in the tapestry of time, made visible when we choose one of its iridescent threads to be real and find it must pull against all the others it might have been.
