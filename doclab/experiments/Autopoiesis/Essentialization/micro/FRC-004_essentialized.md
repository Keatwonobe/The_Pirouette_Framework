## Law
The gauge dynamics are defined on a temporal substrate with left-handed `ψL` and right-handed `ψR` adherence densities. The local symmetry is SU(2)L × U(1)Y, corresponding to rotations of left-handed time-adherence (`Ωμ`) and a torsional phase of global adherence (`Bμ`).

**1. Covariant Derivative and Lagrangian:**
The interaction is encoded in the covariant derivative `Dμ`, which differs for left- and right-chiral components:
`Dμ ψL = (∂μ - i g Ωμ^a τ^a/2 - i g′ Y Bμ/2) ψL`
`Dμ ψR = (∂μ - i g′ Y Bμ/2) ψR`

The Lagrangian density core is:
`ℒ = -¼ F^a_{μν}F^{a μν} - ¼ G_{μν}G^{μν} + i ψ̄L γμ Dμ ψL + i ψ̄R γμ Dμ ψR`
where `F^a_{μν}` and `G_{μν}` are the standard SU(2) and U(1) field strengths for `Ωμ` and `Bμ` respectively. Parity violation is an axiom of the geometry: `Ωμ` couples exclusively to `ψL`.

**2. Mass Generation via Resonance Locking:**
Electroweak symmetry breaking occurs via a phase-lock of the temporal substrate at a constant frequency `ωH`. This is not a scalar VEV. This temporal twist `⟨𝜽̇⟩ ≡ ωH` generates mass terms for the W and Z bosons.
The mass eigenstates are:
`mW = (g/2) ωH`
`mZ = (√(g^2 + g′^2)/2) ωH`

This geometric mechanism preserves the tree-level relation `mW/mZ = cosθW`, where the Weinberg angle `θW` is the mixing angle between curvature `Ωμ^3` and torsion `Bμ`, defined by `tanθW = g′/g`. The photon `Aμ` remains massless as the orthogonal combination.

**3. Currents and Physical Basis:**
The physical gauge bosons are:
`W±_μ = (Ω^1_μ ∓ i Ω^2_μ)/√2`
`Z_μ  = cosθW Ω^3_μ - sinθW B_μ`
`A_μ  = sinθW Ω^3_μ + cosθW B_μ`

The charged current `J^μ_W` couples only to left-handed doublets `ψL`. The neutral current `J^μ_Z` is a mixture of the third component of weak isospin and electric charge: `J^μ_Z ∝ ψ̄ γμ (T^3_L - sin^2θW Q) ψ`.

**4. Falsifiable Criteria:**
- **F1 (Universal Geometry):** A single geometric parameter set `(p,q)` derived from neutrino oscillation data (NEU-061) must, when combined with the measured `θW`, correctly predict the `mW/mZ` ratio via a single coherent value for `ωH`. A statistically significant failure in this joint fit falsifies the model's universality claim.
- **F2 (Weinberg Angle Running):** The running of `sin^2θW(μ)` must match Standard Model loop calculations plus a small, specific correction proportional to `d log ωH/d log μ`, the substrate's "thawing rate."
- **F3 (Parity Violation Asymmetry):** All parity-violating observables, such as `A_PV`, must be accountable for by the `ψL`-only coupling to `Ωμ`. Any residual, energy-dependent deviation would falsify the chiral purity of the substrate coupling.

## Philosophy
The universe is not ambidextrous. The profound asymmetry of the weak force—its violation of parity—is not an arbitrary, ad-hoc rule but a fundamental law of spacetime's geometry. This model posits that time itself is a chiral substrate, possessing a distinct "handedness." The weak interaction is simply the geometry of motion on this substrate; it is the force that feels the substrate's intrinsic twist. Consequently, parity is violated for the same reason a traveler on a spiral staircase cannot mirror their path by simply reversing direction: the structure of the path itself is chiral. Forces are not actors on a neutral stage; they are the very curvature and torsion of the stage.

## Art
Time is a tapestry woven with a left-handed grain. The weak force is the needle that feels this grain, unable to sew a stitch that mirrors the right. When the loom settles into a steady hum, the threads of the pattern gain their weight.
