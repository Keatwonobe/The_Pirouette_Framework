## Law
The foundational postulate is a scale-dependent feedback loop where a system's local Temporal Pressure, Γ, is a function of its own resonant intensity, K_τ.
Let Γ(r) be the local Temporal Pressure at a characteristic scale r, and Γ_env be the ambient background pressure. The feedback law is:
Γ(r) = Γ_env + λ * F(K_τ, ρ, r)
where λ is a coupling constant and F is the feedback function.

A first-order expansion of the potential V(Γ(r)) under strong feedback conditions yields an effective potential, V_eff(r), governing the interaction between constituent parts of the system:
V_eff(r) = a/r + b*r

The force F(r) is the negative gradient of this potential:
F(r) = -∇V_eff(r) = - d/dr (a/r + b*r) * r̂ = (a/r² - b) * r̂

From this potential, two theorems necessarily follow:

**Theorem I: Asymptotic Freedom.** As r → 0, the force vanishes. While the classical gradient diverges, the effective coupling `a` is a function of scale (or momentum transfer, Q² ≈ 1/r²). In the high-energy limit, the coupling strength approaches zero.
lim (r→0) F_eff(r) = 0

The constituent particles become asymptotically free and non-interacting at sufficiently small separations.

**Theorem II: Confinement.** As r → ∞, the force approaches a non-zero constant.
lim (r→∞) F(r) = -b * r̂

The work, W, required to separate the particles to an infinite distance diverges:
W = ∫₀^∞ F ⋅ dr = ∫₀^∞ (a/r² - b) dr → -∞
Separation requires infinite energy, which is physically impossible. This represents absolute confinement. At a critical energy density, the field creates new particle pairs rather than permitting escape.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is falsified if the measured inter-particle potential deviates significantly from the V_eff(r) = a/r + b*r form, particularly the linear term `b*r` at large `r`. Observation of a single, isolated particle subject to this force (e.g., a free quark) would constitute definitive falsification.

## Philosophy
A system's identity and its constraints are not imposed externally but arise from a single, self-referential law. The very act of being—of possessing resonance and intensity—dynamically generates the boundaries of that being. Freedom and bondage are not opposing states but are the two necessary, scale-dependent faces of a unified self-interaction.
