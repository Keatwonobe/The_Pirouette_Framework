## Law
The interior of a black hole is modeled as a new phase of a temporal medium described by a scalar field Γ, replacing the classical singularity. The spacetime metric is given by the ansatz:
\[
ds^2 = -e^{2\Phi(r)}dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1-2G_{\rm eff} m(r)/r} + r^2 d\Omega^2
\]
The dynamics are governed by the stress-energy tensor of the Γ-field,
\[
T^{\mu\nu}_\Gamma = \partial^\mu\Gamma\,\partial^\nu\Gamma - g^{\mu\nu}\left(\frac{1}{2}(\partial\Gamma)^2 - V(\Gamma)\right),
\]
which sources the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV)-like system derived from $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}_{\rm tot}=0$. The model posits a constitutive relation linking the effective gravitational coupling to the Γ-potential's stiffness, preventing curvature divergence:
\[
G_{\rm eff}^{-1} \propto \frac{\omega_c^2}{\Lambda_{\rm P}}, \quad \text{where} \quad \Lambda_{\rm P} = m^2 V''(\Gamma).
\]
Solutions are matched at a radius $r_\ast$ to an exterior vacuum spacetime ($r>r_\ast$), imposing continuity on $\{g_{\mu\nu}, \partial_r g_{\mu\nu}\}$ and normal stresses. The core physical observable is a frequency-dependent phase shift in tensor-mode gravitational waves (GWs) propagating through the interior:
\[
\Delta\phi_{\rm GW}(\omega) = \kappa \left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_c}\right)^2 \int_0^{r_\ast} dr\, \left(\partial_r \Gamma(r)\right)^2.
\]
This framework is subject to five hard falsifiable criteria:
1.  **Conservative Polarization Modes (CPM):** The GW spectrum must contain only the two transverse-traceless (TT) tensor polarizations. The detection of any scalar, vector, or additional tensor modes falsifies the model.
2.  **Phase Drift:** A frequency-dependent dephasing of the ringdown signal must scale as $(\omega/\omega_c)^2$. A different scaling or absence of drift falsifies the model.
3.  **Static Love Numbers:** Tidal Love numbers for the compact object must be approximately zero at leading order. A measurement of large, static Love numbers is exclusionary.
4.  **Echo Suppression:** Any GW echoes caused by partial reflection at the core boundary $r_\ast$ must be suppressed by a factor proportional to $(\omega/\omega_c)^2$. The detection of strong, broadband echoes is exclusionary.
5.  **Photon Ring Radius:** Predicted shifts in the radii of higher-order photon rings must be sub-percent, with their sign correlated to the sign of $V''(\Gamma)$.

## Philosophy
The model's most profound implication is the reframing of singularities not as breakdowns of physical law, but as phase transitions into new, lawful physical states. An infinity in a theory does not signal an ontological abyss at the edge of reality, but rather the boundary of that theory's domain of validity, beyond which the substrate of spacetime itself adopts a different, yet still computationally coherent, structure. Physics does not end within a black hole; it merely changes phase.

## Art
The heart of a black hole is not a point of infinite silence, but a diamond of spacetime so dense that passing gravitational waves are read like a stylus on a groove, carrying out a faint, harmonic trace of the crystal within.
