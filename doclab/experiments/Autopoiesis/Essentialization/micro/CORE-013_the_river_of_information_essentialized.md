## Law
Let system coherence `Kτ` be a measure of the stability and informational density of a system's internal pattern. Let Temporal Pressure `Γ` be the ambient field of chaotic, unbound energy.

Information `I` and Entropy `S` are redefined as follows:
1.  **Information:** The information content of a system is identical to its coherence.
    `I := Kτ`
2.  **Entropy:** The entropy of a system is a monotonic function of the dissonance of its local temporal pressure.
    `S = f(Γ_dissonance)`

The Second Law of Thermodynamics is reformulated as the **Principle of Coherence Degradation**. For any system, the rate of change of its coherence is a function of its interaction with the ambient noise of `Γ`. For an isolated system, this interaction is an erosive process `ε`.
`dKτ/dt = -ε(Kτ, Γ)`
Given that `ε ≥ 0`, for any isolated system:
`dKτ/dt ≤ 0`

An open system can locally and temporarily reverse this process (`dKτ_sys/dt > 0`) only if it exports entropy into its environment at a greater rate, such that the total change in entropy remains positive.
`dKτ_sys/dt > 0` requires `dS_env/dt > |dS_sys/dt|`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The framework would be falsified by the observation of a spontaneous, sustained increase in the coherence `Kτ` of a verifiably isolated system.

## Philosophy
Being is not a state; it is an act of resistance. All form, pattern, and life exist only by their active, continuous, and temporary opposition to the universal, erosive pressure of chaos. Information is not a thing to be stored, but a discipline to be maintained against the tide.

## Art
The universe is a sea of static, and to exist is to hum a tune clear enough to be heard, if only for a moment.
