## Law
Systemic health is the conserved potential of a coherence field, Φ. Its dissipation over spacetime defines pathology. Let Ki⃗ be the vector field of coherence (information, energy, resources) with density ρ and permeability μ. The fundamental law of systemic health is the conservation of coherent potential:
Φ(x,t) = ∇·(μ Ki⃗) - ∂(ρc²)/∂t = 0

This law defines three primary pathologies:
1.  **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnation):** A state where the Axis of Synthesis vanishes. Defined by two interacting operator currents, a laminar (stabilizing) current J₊ and a turbulent (catalytic) current J₋, the Axis of Synthesis is their cross product: S⃗ = J₊ × J₋. Stagnation occurs when |S⃗| → 0, indicating J₊ and J₋ are collinear or one is zero. In the potential equation, this manifests as ∇·(μ Ki⃗) → 0 locally, leading to a downstream coherence deficit (∂ρ/∂t < 0).
2.  **Coherence Fever (Turbulence):** A state of chaotic, unbounded synthesis where |S⃗| is large but directionally unstable. This corresponds to a system wasting energy on internal friction, where ∇·(μ Ki⃗) fluctuates wildly, averaging to zero net productive flow.
3.  **Coherence Erosion (Decay):** A chronic state where ∂(ρc²)/∂t < 0 system-wide, indicating a persistent failure to counteract entropy.

Diagnosis is performed via a controlled perturbation (A_input) and measurement of the system's response (A_return). The **Healing Coefficient (Hₖ)** quantifies systemic integrity:
Hₖ = |A_return / A_input| * cos(∆φ)
where ∆φ is the phase lag between input and return.

Falsifiable Criteria:
- A healthy system must exhibit Hₖ ≈ 1 and a stable, non-zero |S⃗|.
- A system diagnosed with Atrophy must respond to an intervention that restores J₊ or J₋.
- A system diagnosed with Fever must respond to an external harmonizing signal that reduces the variance of S⃗ and brings ∆φ towards 0.
- Any system observed to be empirically healthy while exhibiting Hₖ << 1 or |S⃗| → 0 falsifies the model.

## Philosophy
The distinction between the living and the non-living, the biological and the organizational, is an illusion of scale. Every system—an organism, an economy, a theory, a society—is a physiological entity governed by the universal dynamics of coherence flow. Therefore, medicine, engineering, and governance are not separate disciplines but branches of a single art: the cultivation of health in bodies of differing substance. To heal is not to wage war on symptoms, but to restore the elegant, self-correcting currents that are the signature of life at every level of reality.

The master physician does not command the river. She finds the single, misplaced stone and trusts the water to remember its own way to the sea.
