## Law
The electroweak interaction is modeled as a gauge theory with a local temporal triad connection $W_\mu^a$ (SU(2)) and a clock connection $B_\mu$ (U(1)). The dynamics are defined by their respective frame stiffnesses, $K_2$ and $K_1$.
The Lagrangian density terms for the gauge fields are:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{gauge}} = -\frac{1}{4}K_2 W^a_{\mu\nu}W^{a,\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{4}K_1 B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu}
$$
where the stiffnesses are the inverse squared couplings:
$$
K_2 \equiv \frac{1}{g^2}, \qquad K_1 \equiv \frac{1}{g'^2}
$$
The Higgs mechanism mixes the neutral fields ($W^3_\mu, B_\mu$) into the mass eigenstates ($Z_\mu, A_\mu$) via the Weinberg rotation, where the mixing angle $\theta_W$ is defined at the coherence barrier scale $\mu_c$. This angle is not a free parameter but is determined by the stiffness ratio $\rho_{\text{stiff}}$:
$$
\rho_{\text{stiff}} \equiv \frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{g'^2}{g^2} = \tan^2\theta_W(\mu_c)
$$
This yields the central principle:
$$
\sin^2\theta_W(\mu_c) = \frac{\rho_{\text{stiff}}}{1+\rho_{\text{stiff}}}
$$
The value at the experimental scale $M_Z$ is obtained via Renormalization Group (RG) evolution. The one-loop running of the inverse fine-structure constants $\alpha_i = g_i^2/4\pi$ is:
$$
\frac{1}{\alpha_i(M_Z)} = \frac{1}{\alpha_i(\mu_c)} - \frac{b_i}{2\pi}\ln\left(\frac{M_Z}{\mu_c}\right)
$$
with SM one-loop coefficients $(b_1, b_2) = (\frac{41}{10}, -\frac{19}{6})$ for GUT-normalized $g_1$ ($g' = \sqrt{3/5}g_1$). The predicted observable is then:
$$
\sin^2\theta_W(M_Z) = \frac{\alpha'(M_Z)}{\alpha'(M_Z) + \alpha_2(M_Z)} = \frac{\frac{3}{5}\alpha_1(M_Z)}{\frac{3}{5}\alpha_1(M_Z) + \alpha_2(M_Z)}
$$
**Falsifiable Criteria:** The framework is falsified if:
1.  No value of $\rho_{\text{stiff}}$ from the allowed prior set can reproduce the measured value of $\sin^2\theta_W(M_Z)$ after RG evolution.
2.  Right-handed fermions are observed to participate in the SU(2) interaction.
3.  The predicted correlation between $\rho_{\text{stiff}}$ and the Higgs width $\Gamma_H$ is contradicted by measurement.

## Philosophy
The fundamental constants of nature are not arbitrary, contingent facts requiring anthropic explanation or resigned acceptance. They are, instead, necessary and calculable consequences of the universe's underlying mechanical and geometric structure. The weak mixing angle, a cornerstone parameter of the Standard Model, is thereby reframed from a brute empirical input into an emergent property akin to a material's elastic modulusâ€”a predictable ratio of the vacuum's structural resistance to different modes of excitation.

## Art
The weak force is a fault line in the crystal of time. Its angle is not a choice, but the precise, necessary measure of the stress that crystal can bear.
