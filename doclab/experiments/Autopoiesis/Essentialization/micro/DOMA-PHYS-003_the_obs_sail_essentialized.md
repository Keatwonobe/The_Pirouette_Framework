## Law
The unconditional dynamics of the system's density matrix `ρ` under continuous, position-dependent weak measurement are governed by the Lindblad master equation:
`dρ/dt = -i/ħ [H, ρ] + ∫ dx k(x) · D[c(x)]ρ`
where `H` is the system Hamiltonian, `k(x) ≥ 0` is the local measurement strength, `c(x)` is the measured observable, and `D[c]ρ` is the dissipator `cρc† - ½{c†c, ρ}`.

For an electron wavepacket `|ψ⟩` interacting with a triadic aperture, the state evolves into a superposition of paths `|ψ⟩ → Σᵢ αᵢ |ψᵢ⟩` for `i ∈ {1, 2, 3}`. Asymmetric observation is imposed by setting the measurement strength vector `k(x)` to be non-zero only along two paths, e.g., `(g₁, g₂, g₃) = (g, g, 0)` with `g > 0`. This asymmetric decoherence reshapes the far-field interference pattern, which is proportional to the momentum-space probability distribution `P(p)`.

The resulting net momentum transfer `⟨Δp⟩` is the first moment of this altered distribution:
`⟨Δp⟩ = ∫ p · P(p; g₁, g₂, g₃) dp`
A non-zero `⟨Δp⟩` arises if and only if the vector `(g₁, g₂, g₃)` lacks the symmetry of the physical aperture. The system experiences a recoil force `F_obs = d⟨Δp⟩/dt` proportional to the information acquisition rate `R ∝ g·B` (gain · bandwidth), not merely the power dissipated in the detectors.

Falsifiable Criteria:
1.  **Symmetry Inversion:** `⟨Δp⟩(g, g, 0) = -⟨Δp⟩(g, 0, g)`. Swapping the unobserved arm must invert the sign of the momentum transfer.
2.  **Symmetry Null:** `⟨Δp⟩(g, g, g) = 0`. Symmetrical observation must yield zero net thrust.
3.  **Information Scaling:** `∂|⟨Δp⟩| / ∂R > 0` for constant beam power. The effect must scale with the information rate, not the input energy.
4.  **Basis Dependence:** For fixed `g` and beam power, changing the measurement basis (e.g., from position to momentum on one arm) must alter `⟨Δp⟩`.

## Philosophy
The boundary between epistemology and ontology dissolves. The act of knowing is not a passive reflection of reality, but an active, motive force that can be structured to perform work. A gradient in *knowability*—an asymmetry in the questions posed to a system—generates a physical potential as real as any classical field. This demonstrates that an observer's chosen geometry of inquiry is a fundamental, causal agent that sculpts the physical world, proving that a map, if drawn with sufficient intent, alters the territory it describes.

A sail is pushed by wind. A mind is moved by truth. Here, a sail is pushed by the partial telling of a truth—a shadow cast by a choice, whose edge has the substance of a force.
