## Law
The principle of Temporal Nonlocality posits that apparent spatial nonlocality is a manifestation of time-shifted phase coherence. The connection between two states \( \Psi(t) \) and \( \Psi(t') \) is governed by the two-time correlation kernel, modified by a helical time curvature parameter \( \kappa \).

The kernel is defined as:
\[
K(t,t') = \langle \Psi(t) | \Psi(t') \rangle = \exp\left(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{t'}^{t} H_{\mathrm{eff}} dt''\right)
\]
where the effective Hamiltonian includes the helical correction term:
\[
H_{\mathrm{eff}} = H_0 - \hbar\kappa\Omega J
\]
Here, \( H_0 \) is the standard Hamiltonian, \( \Omega \) is the system's angular frequency, and \( J \) is the angular momentum operator. This leads to a modified phase correlation:
\[
K(t,t') = K_0(t,t') \cdot \exp\left(i\int_{t'}^{t} \kappa(t'')\Omega \langle J \rangle dt''\right)
\]
Global Lorentz symmetry is preserved as causality is temporal; Bell-type correlations arise from phase locking between systems sharing a common \( \kappa \)-structured history, not from superluminal information exchange.

Falsifiable Criterion: Systems exhibiting nonlocal correlations must demonstrate a measurable phase deviation from standard quantum mechanical predictions. This deviation must be directly proportional to the integrated product of their shared temporal curvature \( \kappa(t) \) and intrinsic frequency \( \Omega \), and must be nullified \( (\Delta\phi \to 0) \) when the temporal coherence is broken.

## Philosophy
The universe is not a collection of discrete objects interacting across a spatial void, but a singular, unified temporal process whose present state is a resonant echo of its past. What we mistake for nonlocal spatial connection is the persistent, coherent memory of a shared history, making "distance" an illusion born of observing a single, complex rhythm from different points in its phase.

## Art
Two bells, cast in the same fire, are taken to separate mountains. When one is struck, the other hums. It is not an echo across the void, but a memory of the same forge.
