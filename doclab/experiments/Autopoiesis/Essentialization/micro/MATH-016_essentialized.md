## Law
The system is defined by a complex scalar field $(C)$ and a real scalar field $(\Gamma)$ governed by the Lagrangian:
$$ \mathcal L = |\partial_\mu C|^2 + \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\Gamma)^2 - V(|C|^2,\Gamma) $$
Finite-energy, non-trivial, static solutions in 3+1D are forbidden by Derrick's Theorem. This is evaded by the Q-ball ansatz $C(t,\mathbf x) = e^{i\omega t}\phi(r)$, which possesses a conserved Noether charge $Q = \int d^3x\, i(C^*\partial_t C - C\partial_t C^*) = 2\omega \int d^3x\, \phi(r)^2$.

**Existence Criterion:** A non-trivial solution exists if the effective potential for $\phi$, $U(\phi) \equiv \min_{\Gamma} V(\phi^2,\Gamma)$, satisfies the condition $\exists\phi>0$ such that $\frac{U(\phi)}{\phi^2} < \omega^2 < m_C^2$, where $m_C^2 = \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial C \partial C^*}|_{C=0}$. Solutions $(\phi(r), \Gamma(r))$ are localized, finite-energy minimizers of the functional $E_\omega = \int d^3x \left[ |\nabla\phi|^2 + \frac{1}{2}|\nabla\Gamma|^2 + V(\phi^2,\Gamma) - \omega^2\phi^2 \right]$.

The radial field profiles obey the Euler-Lagrange equations:
$$ \phi''+\frac{2}{r}\phi' = \phi \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial(\phi^2)} - \omega^2 \right) $$
$$ \Gamma''+\frac{2}{r}\Gamma' = \frac{\partial V}{\partial\Gamma}(\phi^2,\Gamma) $$
with boundary conditions $\phi'(0)=\Gamma'(0)=0$ and $\phi(\infty)=0, \Gamma(\infty)=\Gamma_{\text{vac}}$.

**Falsifiable Stability Criterion:** A branch of Q-ball solutions is classically stable to small, linear perturbations if and only if the charge is a monotonically decreasing function of the internal frequency $\omega$.
$$ \frac{dQ}{d\omega} < 0 $$
If this condition is violated, the fluctuation operator $\mathcal H$ derived from the quadratic action for perturbations $(\eta_1, \eta_2, \xi)$ around the solution $(C=e^{i\omega t}[\phi+i\eta_1+\eta_2], \Gamma=\Gamma_0+\xi)$ possesses at least one negative eigenvalue, signaling an unstable mode.

## Philosophy
The existence of objects is not a fundamental property of substance, but a dynamically-achieved equilibrium. "Things" are not irreducible entities, but rather self-sustaining, stable configurations of an underlying, more fluid reality. Their persistence is not guaranteed by intrinsic indestructibility, but by a delicate balance between the universal tendency toward dispersion and a binding coherence, underwritten by a conserved quantity. Matter, in its most elemental form, is a knot of order that has successfully negotiated the terms of its own existence with the laws of its substrate.

## Art
A field, humming a constant note, spins a whirlpool into being. It is a thing made of pure motion, a temporary solid forged from ceaseless flow, holding its form against the silent, empty current. Its reality is not the water, but the spin that binds it.
