## Law
The unperturbed quantum harmonic oscillator is described by the Hamiltonian \(H_0 = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2 = \hbar\omega(a^\dagger a + \frac{1}{2})\). Applying a helical time curvature, represented by the parameter \(\kappa(t)\), modifies the system's dynamics. The effective Hamiltonian becomes \(H_{\mathrm{eff}} = H_0 - \hbar\,\kappa(t)\,\Omega\,J\), where \(J=a^\dagger a\) is the number operator generating phase rotations and \(\Omega\) is a coupling constant.

For a weak, stationary curvature \(\langle \kappa \rangle = \int \kappa(t) dt \neq 0\), first-order perturbation theory yields a linear shift in the quasi-energy spectrum:
\[
E_n = \left\langle n \left| H_{\mathrm{eff}} \right| n \right\rangle = \hbar\omega\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) - \hbar\Omega\langle \kappa \rangle n
\]
This central equation predicts a spectral shift \(\Delta E_n = - \hbar\Omega\langle \kappa \rangle n\) directly proportional to the mode number \(n\).

Falsifiable criteria are:
1.  **Chiral Asymmetry:** In a medium with non-zero mean helicity (\(\langle\kappa\rangle \neq 0\)), spectroscopic measurements must reveal level-dependent frequency shifts \(\Delta\omega_n = -\Omega\langle\kappa\rangle n\). The sign of the shift must correlate with the chirality of the medium.
2.  **Null Result:** In an achiral medium (\(\langle\kappa\rangle = 0\)), the standard spectrum \(E_n = \hbar\omega(n+\frac{1}{2})\) must be recovered to within experimental error.
3.  **Resonant Squeezing:** Parametric driving via \(\kappa(t) = \kappa_0 \cos(2\omega t)\) must induce phase-sensitive quantum squeezing, distinct from the static energy shift.

## Philosophy
The perceived uniformity and symmetry of time is not a fundamental property of reality, but a local condition contingent on the absence of chirality. This work implies that time is not a passive, featureless background but an active, geometric medium whose local curvature is determined by the material asymmetries within it. Just as mass curves spacetime, chirality twists time, meaning the fundamental laws of physics are subtly but demonstrably different in a left-handed versus a right-handed environment.
