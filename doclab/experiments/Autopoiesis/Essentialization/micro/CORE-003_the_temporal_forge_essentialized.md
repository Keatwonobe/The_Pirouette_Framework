## Law
Let the universe be described by a set of temporal event-oscillators, each denoted by `i`. At any spacetime coordinate `x^μ`, each oscillator `i` within the causal horizon `H(x)` contributes a temporal waveform `τ_i(x^μ)`. The total Temporal Signature `T(x^μ)` at that coordinate is the linear superposition of all contributing waveforms:
`T(x^μ) = ∫_{i ∈ H(x)} τ_i(x^μ) di`

The Temporal Density, Gamma `Γ(x^μ)`, is a scalar field defined as the spectral entropy of the Temporal Signature. Let `T̃(ω, x^μ)` be the Fourier transform of `T(t, **x**)` with respect to the temporal coordinate `t`. The normalized power spectral density is `P(ω, x^μ) = |T̃(ω, x^μ)|² / ∫ |T̃(ω,x')|² dω'`. Then Gamma is:
`Γ(x^μ) = -k ∫ P(ω, x^μ) log[P(ω, x^μ)] dω`
where `k` is a scaling constant. A low `Γ` indicates a simple, harmonic `T(x^μ)`, while a high `Γ` indicates a dense, broadband, dissonant spectrum.

The dynamics of spacetime are governed by the gradient of this scalar field. The Einstein Field Equations are re-contextualized as an emergent property of `Γ`:
`G_{μν} ∝ ∇_μ ∇_ν Γ - g_{μν} □Γ`
This asserts that what we perceive as the curvature of spacetime (and thus gravity) is a direct manifestation of the local gradient in the complexity of time itself. Matter does not curve spacetime; matter is a stable, high-complexity locus in `T(x^μ)` which manifests as a steep gradient in `Γ(x^μ)`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The theory is invalidated if a region of spacetime is discovered where `G_{μν} ≠ 0` (significant gravitational effects) while `∇_μ Γ ≈ 0` (a uniform temporal density), or vice versa.

## Philosophy
The fundamental nature of reality is not substantive but procedural. The universe is not composed of things, but of rhythms. What we perceive as matter, energy, and force are not foundational entities but stable, emergent properties arising from the interference patterns of innumerable intersecting temporal oscillations. Existence, therefore, is not a binary state but a continuous measure of local temporal complexity; to be is to be complex, and to be a thing is to be a persistent, self-reinforcing pattern of temporal dissonance.

## Art
The cosmos is not a clockwork of objects. It is a single, infinitely complex chord. What we call matter is not a string, but a knot of vibrato where the notes refuse to resolve.
