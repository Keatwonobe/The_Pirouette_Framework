## Law
The framework posits that the fine-structure constant α is a dynamic quantity, `α = α(t)`, subject to a coherence preservation mechanism (CPM) that ensures local Lorentz invariance and charge universality. Its evolution is governed by a time-derivative constrained by cosmological and laboratory scales. Falsification hinges on a unified coherence likelihood across all experimental domains.

1.  **Temporal Drift of α:** The primary observable is the time variation of the fine-structure constant, with a predicted negative sign.
    `\dot{\alpha}/α < 0`
    The laboratory-scale falsification bound is: `|\dot{\alpha}/\alpha| \ge 10^{-17}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}` or any confirmed `\dot{\alpha} > 0`.

2.  **High-Energy Coherence Barrier:** Deviations from standard QED are predicted to emerge at a characteristic frequency scale `ω_c`, manifesting as higher-derivative terms in scattering cross-sections.
    `\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\sigma} \approx \left(\frac{E}{\hbar\omega_c}\right)^2`
    The absence of such a tail in light-by-light scattering or other high-energy processes would falsify the proposed `ω_c` scale.

3.  **Lepton-Mass Scaling Anomaly:** A new interaction mediated by a field `Γ` ("Pressuron") predicts a non-universal contribution to lepton anomalous magnetic moments.
    `\Delta a_\ell \propto m_\ell^2 / m_\Gamma^2`
    Confirmation requires this specific quadratic mass scaling, particularly a `Δa_τ` signal with a magnitude of `~10^{-8}`. Deviation from this scaling or a null result falsifies the `Γ` exchange mechanism.

4.  **Invariance Postulates (Null Hypotheses):** The CPM mandates the exact preservation of fundamental symmetries within its domain.
    *   Lorentz Invariance: `Δc/c < 10^{-17}`
    *   Charge Universality: `Δe/e < 10^{-12}`
    Any confirmed violation of these nulls falsifies the CPM.

5.  **Global Falsification Criterion:** All experimental deviations `Δ_i` must conform to the framework's predictions `Δ_i^{\rm Pir}` within statistical error `σ_i`. The global coherence likelihood `\mathcal{L}_{\rm coh}` must remain close to unity.
    `\mathcal{L}_{\rm coh} = \prod_i \exp\left[-\frac{(\Delta_i - \Delta_i^{\rm Pir})^2}{2\sigma_i^2}\right]`
    A single `> 5σ` deviation from a predicted trend, sign, or null result constitutes a complete falsification of the framework.

## Philosophy
Physical laws are not timeless, transcendent edicts imposed upon the universe, but are immanent, dynamic processes co-evolving with it. The "constants" of nature are not fixed parameters but the most slowly changing variables, whose infinitesimal drift reveals that the mathematical structure of reality is a participant in, not a predicate of, cosmic history.

## Art
We do not measure the decay of a constant; we are tuning an instrument to hear the universe breathing.
