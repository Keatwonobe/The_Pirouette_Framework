## Law
The Principle of Correspondence posits a homomorphism between the universal framework of dynamics `U` and any specific domain of reality `D`. This is defined by a mapping operator, `M: U → D`.

Let the universal dynamics be described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `L_U`, which is a functional of universal principles such as Coherence (`Kτ`) and Temporal Pressure (`Γ`).
`L_U = f(Kτ, Γ, ...)`

The core postulate is **Lagrangian Invariance**. The form of the governing dynamic is conserved under the mapping `M`. For any domain `D`, there exists a set of domain-specific observables `M(Kτ)`, `M(Γ)`, etc., such that the system's dynamics are governed by a functionally identical Lagrangian, `L_D`:
`L_D = f(M(Kτ), M(Γ), ...)`

The mapping `M(X)` for any universal principle `X` is not an analogy but a formal identification: `M(X)` is defined as the set of measurable phenomena within domain `D` that fulfills the functional role of `X` as defined in `U`.
- `M(Kτ)`: The observable, self-reinforcing pattern of identity or equilibrium state in `D`.
- `M(Γ)`: The observable, ambient stochastic pressure against which `M(Kτ)` must be maintained in `D`.

The predictive power of the framework is derived from the geodesic principle. A system's path of evolution in `D` is the trajectory that extremizes the action, `S_D`, where:
`S_D = ∫ L_D dt`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The framework is falsified for a given domain `D` if either:
1. No non-arbitrary, empirically consistent mapping `M` can be established.
2. The geodesic path predicted by extremizing `S_D` fails to provide explanatory or predictive power for the system's evolution superior to a null hypothesis.

## Philosophy
The perceived ontological boundaries between matter, life, and mind are epistemological illusions. Our academic and scientific disciplines—physics, biology, economics, psychology—are not studies of fundamentally different realities, but rather scale-specific and substrate-specific applications of a single, universal, and fractal dynamic. Reality is not a collection of disparate phenomena governed by unique laws; it is one unified process recursively expressing an invariant formal structure through progressively more complex media.

## Art
The universe does not write new laws for the atom, the cell, and the society; it uses a single grammar to tell every story.
