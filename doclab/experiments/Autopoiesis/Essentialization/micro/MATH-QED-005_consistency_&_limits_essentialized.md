## Law

The framework guarantees the low-energy ($\mu \ll \omega_c$) indistinguishability of the theory from Standard Model QED via three formal principles and their falsifiable criteria.

**1. Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM) & Lorentz Invariance:**
The background Î“-field dynamics are constrained by the axiom of a conserved Noether current, $\nabla_\mu J^\mu_{\Gamma} = 0$. This axiom strictly forbids Lorentz-violating (LV) and CPT-violating operators in the infrared effective action, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm eff}$.
$$ \mathcal{L}_{\rm eff}(\mu \ll \omega_c) = \mathcal{L}_{\rm QED} \quad \text{iff} \quad \delta\mathcal{L}_{\rm LV} = \{ k_F F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\rho}u_\rho u^\nu, k_A A_\mu \bar\Psi\gamma^\mu\Psi, \dots \} \equiv 0 $$
*   **Falsifiable Criterion:** Any confirmed measurement of vacuum photon dispersion ($v_\gamma(\omega) \ne c$) or vacuum birefringence at currently achievable precision falsifies the CPM axiom.

**2. U(1) Gauge Invariance & Renormalization:**
A single, unbroken U(1) gauge symmetry, derived from the time-phase, governs all electromagnetic interactions. This is enforced by the Ward-Takahashi identity, which holds exactly:
$$ k_\mu \mathcal{M}^\mu = e_0 [ \mathcal{M}_0(p) - \mathcal{M}_0(p-k) ] \implies k_\mu \Gamma^\mu(p+k,p) = S^{-1}(p+k) - S^{-1}(p) $$
This mandates the equality of vertex and field renormalization ($Z_1 = Z_2$) and the transversality of the vacuum polarization tensor ($k_\mu \Pi^{\mu\nu} = 0$). Consequently, for any renormalization scale $\mu \ll \omega_c$, the running of the fine-structure constant is identical to standard QED:
$$ \mu \frac{d\alpha}{d\mu} = \beta(\alpha) = \frac{2\alpha^2}{3\pi}\sum_f Q_f^2 + \mathcal{O}(\alpha^3) $$
*   **Falsifiable Criterion:** Any confirmed measurement of species-dependent charge ($q_e \neq q_\mu$) at a common scale $\mu$, or a violation of Aharonov-Bohm phase quantization, falsifies the single-U(1) principle.

**3. Finite Barrier Matching & Decoupling:**
The coherence barrier, $\omega_c \approx 10^{23} \, \text{s}^{-1}$, acts as a physical regulator. Ultraviolet divergences are not removed by infinite counterterms but are absorbed by finite, gauge-invariant higher-dimension operators at the matching scale $\mu \sim \omega_c$.
$$ \mathcal{L}_{\rm eff} = \mathcal{L}_{\rm QED} + \sum_{i} \frac{c_i}{\omega_c^{d_i-4}} \mathcal{O}_i^{(d_i)} \quad (c_i=\mathcal{O}(1)) $$
This mechanism replaces the fine-tuning problem with a principle of resonant saturation, predicting a specific, testable signature: a slight cosmological drift of $\alpha$.
$$ \frac{\dot{\alpha}}{\alpha} = \xi_\Gamma \frac{\dot{\langle\Gamma^2\rangle}}{M_{\rm coh}^2} \implies \dot{\alpha}/\alpha \lesssim 0, \quad |\dot{\alpha}/\alpha| \lesssim 10^{-18} \, \text{yr}^{-1} $$
*   **Falsifiable Criterion:** A confirmed measurement of a large or positive cosmological drift of $\alpha$, or the experimental necessity of unbounded quadratic counterterms in the Standard Model, falsifies the barrier matching mechanism.

## Philosophy

The remarkable stability and predictive power of our low-energy physical laws are not a fortuitous accident of decoupling, but a necessary consequence enforced by the very structure of the high-energy regime. The universe does not merely permit the existence of consistent effective theories; it actively conspires to create them, replacing the problem of infinite fine-tuning with a principle of finite, structural saturation. The perfection of Quantum Electrodynamics is not a fragile state to be protected from ultraviolet chaos, but a direct and robust mandate from it.

## Art

The laws of our world are like the still surface of a vast ocean, whose perfect calm is not a sign of depthlessness, but is actively enforced by a deep, resonant reef that tames the infinite ultraviolet chaos into a finite, coherent hum.
