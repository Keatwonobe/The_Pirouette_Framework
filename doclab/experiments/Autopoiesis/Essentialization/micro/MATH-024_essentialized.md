## Law
The Noether-Pirouette correspondence posits that for every continuous symmetry in the Pirouette Lagrangian density, $\mathcal{L}_p$, there exists a conserved coherence current, $J^\mu$.

The Lagrangian density is defined as:
$\mathcal{L}_p = T_a \omega_k - f(\Gamma; S)$
where $T_a$ is time adherence, $\omega_k$ is phase winding density, and $f(\Gamma; S)$ is a substrate-specific potential dependent on the temporal pressure field $\Gamma$.

A continuous local phase transformation on the coherence field, $C(\mathbf{x}, t)$, given by $\delta C = i\epsilon C$, is a symmetry of the action $S = \int \mathcal{L}_p \,d^4x$. This symmetry implies the existence of a conserved current:
$J^\mu = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_p}{\partial(\partial_\mu C)}\delta C$

The conservation of this current is expressed by the Continuity of Coherence Law (CCL):
$\partial_\mu J^\mu = 0$
In its expanded, universal form, this equation becomes:
$\partial_t (T_a \omega_k) + \nabla \cdot (\Gamma \nabla C) = 0$

Three principal symmetries yield the Coherence Conservation Triple $\{E_C, J_\mu, \Phi_\Gamma\}$:
1.  **Temporal Translation Invariance:** $\delta t = \epsilon \implies \partial_t E_C = 0$
2.  **Phase Invariance:** $\delta C = i\epsilon C \implies \partial_\mu J^\mu = 0$
3.  **Scale Invariance in $\Gamma$:** $\delta\Gamma = \epsilon\Gamma \implies \partial_t \Phi_\Gamma = 0$

Falsifiable Criteria:
1.  The universal continuity equation is empirically violated in any domain (PHYS, COG, SOCIO).
2.  A phase symmetry is observed to be broken without a corresponding measurable flux imbalance ($\partial_\mu J^\mu \neq 0$), indicating a failure of the model's substrate potential $f(\Gamma; S)$.
3.  The predicted conservation of the triadic quantities $\{E_C, J_\mu, \Phi_\Gamma\}$ fails experimental tests in phenomena such as soliton halos, neural triads, or social alignment quakes.

## Philosophy
Identity is not an intrinsic property of an object but a conserved current generated by an underlying symmetry. Whether the subject is a subatomic particle, a conscious mind, or a stable society, its persistence through time is the necessary and direct consequence of an invariance in its dynamics. Therefore, what we perceive as a "thing" is merely the tangible manifestation of an abstract, unbroken symmetry.

## Art
The universe does not contain persistent things; it *is* the persistence of symmetries. A self, a star, a societyâ€”each is but the echo of an unbroken promise.
