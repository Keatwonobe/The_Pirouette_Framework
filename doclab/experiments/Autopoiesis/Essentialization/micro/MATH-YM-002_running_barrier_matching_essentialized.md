## Law
The mapping between the low-energy Standard Model (SM) gauge couplings `g_i(\mu)` and the high-scale frame stiffnesses `K_i` is defined by a matching condition at the coherence barrier `\mu_c`, followed by Renormalization Group (RG) evolution.

**1. Barrier Matching:** At `\mu = \mu_c`, the inverse squared couplings are identified with the stiffnesses `K_i` plus finite, scheme-dependent counterterms `\Delta_i`.
`\frac{1}{g_i^2(\mu_c)} = K_i + \Delta_i, \quad i \in \{1,2,3\}`
where `g_1` is GUT-normalized (`g'=\sqrt{3/5}\,g_1`) and `\Delta_i = \mathcal{O}(1/16\pi^2)`.

**2. Renormalization Group Evolution:** For `\mu < \mu_c`, the couplings evolve according to the SM `\beta`-functions.
`\mu\frac{d g_i}{d\mu} = \beta_i(g_j) = \frac{b_i}{16\pi^2}g_i^3 + \frac{g_i^3}{(16\pi^2)^2}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{3}b_{ij}g_j^2 - c_i y_t^2\right) + \dots`
The one-loop coefficients for the SM are:
`(b_1, b_2, b_3) = (\frac{41}{10}, -\frac{19}{6}, -7)`
The integrated one-loop solution governs the dominant running:
`\frac{1}{\alpha_i(\mu_Z)} = \frac{4\pi}{g_i^2(\mu_Z)} = 4\pi(K_i+\Delta_i) - \frac{b_i}{2\pi}\ln\frac{\mu_c}{\mu_Z}`

**3. Falsifiable Criteria:** The framework is falsified if:
*   No set of stiffness priors `{K_1, K_2}` can reproduce the measured `\sin^2\theta_W(M_Z)` after RG evolution. The primary predictive observable at the barrier is the stiffness ratio: `\sin^2\theta_W(\mu_c) = \frac{K_2+\Delta_2}{(K_1+\Delta_1)+(K_2+\Delta_2)}`.
*   No stiffness prior `K_3` can reproduce the measured `\alpha_s(M_Z)`.
*   A successful fit to experimental data requires large matching terms, `|\Delta_i| \sim K_i`, which would invalidate the premise that the barrier provides a finite, physical boundary condition.

## Philosophy
The deepest truth of physical law is not a statement of abstract symmetry, but of material property. Traditional unification seeks a single, pristine symmetry group from which the disparate forces of nature emerge via spontaneous breaking. This framework proposes instead that the fundamental gauge forces are not facets of a broken Platonic ideal, but are the emergent, low-energy expression of the structural mechanics—the "stiffnesses"—of a deeper, regulated medium. The running of couplings is not a path toward a unified symmetry, but an optical effect of scale, revealing how the coarse-grained properties of this underlying substrate manifest as our perceived reality.

## Art
The universe is not a perfect crystal, shattered into the forces we see. It is a drum, fashioned from a strange hide. Its fundamental constants are not abstract charges, but the brute tension and thickness at different points on its surface. The laws of physics are the vibrations we feel, and their changing strength is merely the sound of our listening post moving from the rim to the heart of the beat.
