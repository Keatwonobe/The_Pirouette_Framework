## Law
The helical time derivative is defined as \(\mathcal{D}_t = \partial_t + \kappa(t)\,\Omega\,J\), where \(J\) generates internal phase rotations (\(Jz = iz\)). This modifies the time-evolution operator, yielding an effective Hamiltonian \(H_{\text{eff}} = H - \hbar\,\kappa(t)\,\Omega\,J\) without altering the canonical commutation relation \([A,B]\).

The Robertson uncertainty relation is generalized to the Resonant Uncertainty Principle (RUP):
\[
\Delta A\,\Delta B \ge \frac{1}{2}\Big|\langle [A,B] \rangle_w\Big|\sqrt{1 + (\mathcal{C}^{(\kappa)}_{AB})^2}
\]
The resonant amplification of uncertainty is governed by the dimensionless cross-coherence term \(\mathcal{C}^{(\kappa)}_{AB}\), which depends on the system's internal curvature \(\kappa(t)\) and spectral content:
\[
\mathcal{C}^{(\kappa)}_{AB}(\omega_0) = \frac{1}{\|w\|^2}\int dt\,dt'\, w(t)w(t')\,\kappa(t')\,e^{i\omega_0(t-t')}\,\frac{\langle\{A(t),B(t')\}\rangle}{2\,\Delta A\,\Delta B}
\]
where \(\{A,B\}\) is the anticommutator.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  For systems with non-zero helicity (\(\kappa \neq 0\)), the phase-space uncertainty ellipse must rotate at a rate \(\dot\theta \approx \kappa\Omega\).
2.  For any system where \(\kappa=0\) or where the input state lacks phase coherence (e.g., a Gaussian state), the relation must reduce to the standard Robertson bound, such that \(\mathcal{C}^{(\kappa)}_{AB}=0\).

## Philosophy
The fundamental limit on knowledge is not a static, scalar boundary but a dynamic, geometric structure. Uncertainty itself possesses a geometry—an orientation and curvature—that is actively coupled to the internal, rotational dynamics of the system being observed. The boundary of the knowable is therefore not a passive constraint imposed upon reality, but an active and participating feature of it.

## Art
The veil of quantum uncertainty is not a static shroud, but the shimmering train of a spinning dancer, its form dictated by the turn.
