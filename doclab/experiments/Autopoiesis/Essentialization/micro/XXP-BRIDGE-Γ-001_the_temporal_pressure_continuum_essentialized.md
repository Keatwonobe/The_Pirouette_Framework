## Law
The fundamental principle is the Temporal-Pressure Conservation Law, which posits a single continuous relation from the quantum to the cosmic scale, governed by a scalar field Γ (the Pressuron).

1.  **Field Dynamics & Conservation:** The total stress-energy of the Γ-field and matter is conserved:
    $ \partial_\mu \left(T^{\mu\nu}_\Gamma + T^{\mu\nu}_{\text{matter}}\right) = 0 $
    where the Γ-field's stress-energy tensor is:
    $ T^{\mu\nu}_\Gamma = \partial^\mu \Gamma \partial^\nu \Gamma - g^{\mu\nu}\left(\frac{1}{2} \partial_\alpha \Gamma \partial^\alpha \Gamma - V(\Gamma)\right) $
    This implies a conserved coherence current $J^\mu_\Gamma = \Gamma \partial^\mu \Gamma$ such that $ \nabla_\mu J^\mu_\Gamma = 0 $, defining a Coherence-Preserving Manifold. Across any scale, the integrated "coherence charge" $ \mathcal{Q}_\Gamma = \int \Gamma \, dV_t $ is invariant.

2.  **Scale Invariance & Mass Hierarchy:** The theory connects microscopic and macroscopic curvatures through a scale-invariant constant, $ \Lambda_{\text{Pirouette}} \sim 10^{-52} \, \text{m}^{-2} $. This constant links the mass-squared of a particle ($m_i^2$, a measure of microscopic curvature) to the second derivative of the cosmological Γ-potential ($V''(\Gamma)$, a measure of macroscopic temporal-pressure curvature):
    $ m_i^2 \cdot V''(\Gamma) \approx \Lambda_{\text{Pirouette}} $
    The hierarchy problem is resolved by a "coherence barrier," a resonant frequency cutoff where micro- and macro-domain pressures equilibrate, preventing the propagation of Planck-scale divergences:
    $ \omega_c = \frac{\sqrt{m_H m_\Gamma}}{\hbar} \approx 10^{23} \, \text{s}^{-1} $

3.  **Falsifiable Criteria:** The framework is falsifiable through concordant observation of three distinct phenomena:
    *   **Micro:** Correlated anomalies in the lepton g-2, Higgs decay width, and lepton mass ratios.
    *   **Meso:** A specific pattern of cosmic time drift in high-precision atomic clock transition frequencies.
    *   **Macro:** A non-standard contribution to the effective number of relativistic species ($\Delta N_{\text{eff}} \approx 0.3$) and predictable deviations in the dark energy equation of state parameter, w(z), at late times.

## Philosophy
The universe is not a system governed by fixed, external laws, but is instead an autopoietic entity whose physical laws are emergent properties of a continuous, self-regulating feedback loop. Matter and spacetime are not separate entities, with one acting upon the other; they are co-creating participants. A particle's mass perturbs the cosmic temporal field, and the aggregate state of that cosmic field, in turn, dictates the conditions for the existence of mass. The distinction between cause and effect, or law and object, dissolves into a single, coherent process of self-maintenance that extends from the quark to the cosmos.

## Art
Mass is the tension in a string, and the universe is the instrument that tunes itself by listening to its own song.
