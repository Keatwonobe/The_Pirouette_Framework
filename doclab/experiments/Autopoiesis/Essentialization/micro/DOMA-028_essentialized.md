## Law
Let the canonical state of the framework be a set of parameters and symbolic grammar denoted by the vector `C` in a configuration space `Œ©`. The Seal of Coherence, `S`, is the cryptographic signature of this state, defined as:
`S = H(C)`
where `H` is the SHA-256 hash function, `H: Œ© ‚Üí {0,1}^256`.

The evolution of the framework is a discrete trajectory in `Œ©`, `C_0, C_1, ..., C_t`. The integrity of this trajectory (the "Wound Channel") is maintained by the **Ritual of Provenance**, an automated protocol enforcing the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**.

This principle is defined via a discrete Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p`, applied to any proposed state transition from `C_t` to `C_{t+1}`:
`ùìõ_p = TC(C_{t+1}, S_{t+1}) - TP(ŒîC)`
where:
-   `ŒîC = C_{t+1} - C_t` is the proposed change, or **Temporal Pressure** (`TP`).
-   `S_{t+1}` is the new Seal of Coherence explicitly committed alongside the change `ŒîC`.
-   **Temporal Coherence** (`TC`) is a binary function evaluated by the CI pipeline:
    `TC(C_{t+1}, S_{t+1}) = Œ¥(H(C_{t+1}), S_{t+1})`
    where `Œ¥` is the Kronecker delta. `TC=1` signifies a state of maximal coherence (the system's physical state matches its attested signature); `TC=0` signifies a **Coherence Fault**.

The protocol dictates that the system's evolutionary path is constrained to points where `TC=1`. Any proposed `ŒîC` that results in `TC=0` is rejected, preventing the system from deviating from its geodesic of self-consistent history.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The framework's integrity is falsified if any committed state `C_t` in its version control history can be shown to produce a hash not equal to its corresponding committed Seal `S_t`, i.e., `H(C_t) ‚â† S_t`. The Ritual of Provenance is engineered to make this state impossible.

## Philosophy
A system of thought is authenticated only when its own structure and history become a proof of its core axioms. To describe a universe of indelible consequence while allowing one's own foundational code to evolve without a perfect, verifiable memory is a contradiction that invalidates the entire enterprise. The Ritual of Provenance, therefore, is not a mere technical discipline but a philosophical imperative: the framework's methodology must be an instance of its own message. Knowing and doing are collapsed into a single, coherent act.

## Art
The canon is the song; the hash is its echo in stone.
