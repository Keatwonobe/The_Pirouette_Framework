## Law
The theory is founded upon a principal fiber bundle (E, π, M) over spacetime (M, g) with connection 𝔄 and curvature 𝔉. The total action S = ∫_M ℒ_p d⁴x is governed by a Lagrangian density that couples a real scalar field Γ (temporal pressure) to standard model fields (Ψ, A_μ) and the geometry of the bundle.

The core dynamics are encapsulated by the Euler-Lagrange equation for the scalar field Γ:
□Γ + f′(Γ) + 𝒮(Γ, 𝔉, Ψ) = 0
where 𝒮(Γ, 𝔉, Ψ) represents all local, analytic, and scale-covariant interaction terms. A key interaction is the trace coupling g_P Γ T^μ_μ.

A central postulate is the existence of topological defects ("Wound Channels") characterized by an integer index T ∈ ℤ, derived from the homotopy groups of the bundle E. This discrete index directly and non-perturbatively corrects physical observables 𝒪 according to the formula:
Δ𝒪 = Σ_j a_j 𝒦_j(T, R, R², ...)
where 𝒦_j are polynomials in the defect index T and curvature invariants (e.g., R_{μν}R^{μν}). This formulation is falsifiable: T must be an integer, and no continuous mass exponents or empirical running couplings are permitted in this correction term.

Specific falsifiable claims include:
1.  **Anomalous Magnetic Moment (g-2):** The spinor self-energy Σ(p) in the presence of the background (Γ, 𝔉, T) generates a Pauli term κ(σ^{μν}F_{μν}) such that the anomaly a_ℓ = κ_ℓ/2 receives discrete corrections from T.
2.  **Running of α:** Vacuum polarization is modified by Γ, contributing Δα_Pir(q²) = c_Γ ⟨Γ⟩·Φ(q²), where c_Γ is a fixed constant and the kernel Φ(q²) is derived from first principles.
3.  **Electron EDM (d_e):** For CP-even topological classes T, d_e must be zero at leading order. A non-zero d_e implies a non-trivial CP-odd topological sector.

## Philosophy
The continuous, local, and differential character of physical law is an incomplete description of reality. The fundamental constants and particle properties we observe are not solely the result of local field interactions, but are ultimately constrained and quantized by the discrete, global topology of an underlying coherence manifold. Local dynamics are subservient to global structure; the universe possesses an integer-based structural integrity that dictates the spectrum of possible physical outcomes.

## Art
Physics is a symphony played on a manifold, where the laws of harmony are differential equations, but the universe's resonant key is a single, unbreakable integer.
