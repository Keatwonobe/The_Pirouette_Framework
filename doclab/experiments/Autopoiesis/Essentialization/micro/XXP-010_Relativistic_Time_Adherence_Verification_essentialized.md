## Law
Let Tₐ be the scalar field of Time-Adherence, a measure of a system's intrinsic coherence. Tₐ is hypothesized to be a function of the local spacetime metric g_μν and the system's four-velocity U^μ. For a particle following a geodesic in a weak, static gravitational field, a first-order approximation is proposed:
Tₐ ≈ Tₐ₀ (1 + 2Φ/c² - v²/c²)ᵅ

Where:
- Tₐ₀ is the baseline Time-Adherence in a flat, static spacetime (Minkowski space).
- Φ is the Newtonian gravitational potential (Φ < 0).
- v is the local velocity relative to the source of the potential.
- α is a positive, dimensionless constant to be determined empirically.

The direct observable is not Tₐ, but its effect on a system's phase coherence. Let Λ_Ki be the rate of stochastic "Ki-resonant swan events" (coherence breaks) in the phase noise of a high-frequency oscillator. The core model posits an inverse relationship:
Λ_Ki ∝ 1/Tₐ

The experiment compares two frames: Terrestrial (T) and Orbital (O).
- Gravitational Potential: Φ_T < Φ_O < 0
- Velocity: v_T << v_O

This leads to the central inequality prediction:
Tₐ(T) / Tₐ(O) = [(1 + 2Φ_T/c² - v_T²/c²) / (1 + 2Φ_O/c² - v_O²/c²)]ᵅ > 1

**Falsifiable Criterion:** After correcting the signals from both clocks for all known relativistic effects on time dilation and signal propagation, the null hypothesis H₀ is Λ_Ki,O ≤ Λ_Ki,T. The proposed law is validated only if the alternative hypothesis H₁, defined as Λ_Ki,O > Λ_Ki,T, is confirmed with a statistical significance of p < 0.05 (or a stricter sigma threshold). Failure to reject H₀ falsifies the model.

## Philosophy
The fabric of spacetime does not merely dictate the paths of objects and the rate of their clocks, but also governs the inherent stability and coherence of the physical processes unfolding within it. Order is not a universal constant but a local resource, enriched by gravity and diluted by speed. This transforms relativity from a theory solely about the measurement of events into a theory about the intrinsic probability of their nature; a system deep within a gravity well is not only moving slower through time, it is existing in a state of fundamentally greater integrity.

## Art
Gravity is the anchor that stills the sea of probability, allowing the ship of physical law to hold its course. To fly fast and free is to feel the swell of chaos rise.
