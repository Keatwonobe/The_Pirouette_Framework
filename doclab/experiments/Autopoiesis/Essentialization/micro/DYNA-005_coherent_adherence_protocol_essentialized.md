## Law
The Coherent Adherence Protocol is a constrained optimization framework for guiding a system toward a target coherent state.

1.  **Core Observable (Adherence Order Parameter):**
    \[
    T_a \;=\;\Bigl|\frac{1}{V}\int_V e^{i\theta(x^\mu)}\,dV\Bigr|^2 \in [0, 1]
    \]
    where \(\theta(x^\mu)\) is the phase of a component field or agent state over the system's manifold \(V\).

2.  **Governing Objective Function:** An action \(\mathcal A\) (e.g., shaping measurement basis, noise, or incentives) is optimal if it maximizes the system's usable coherence under explicit costs and constraints:
    \[
    \max_{\mathcal A}\;\; \mathbf E[\,K_\tau(T_a)\,] - V_\Gamma - V_{\text{obs}} - \lambda\,\mathcal D \quad \text{s.t.}\;\;\mathcal C_{\mathrm{consent}} \land \mathcal C_{\mathrm{transparency}}
    \]
    - \(K_\tau(T_a)\): Usable coherence (kinetic term).
    - \(V_\Gamma\): Potential energy or pressure against coherence.
    - \(V_{\text{obs}}\): The "Shadow Gauge," an explicit cost of observation, measurement, or back-action on the system.
    - \(\mathcal D\): The Dark Residue functional, quantifying negative externalities:
      \[
      \mathcal D \;=\; \alpha\,\mathrm{Div}(\text{welfare})+\beta\,\mathrm{Ext}(\text{risk}) +\gamma\,\mathrm{Debt}(\text{attention})+\delta\,\mathrm{Loss}(\text{autonomy})
      \]
    - \(\mathcal C_{\mathrm{consent}} \land \mathcal C_{\mathrm{transparency}}\): Hard constraints mandating informed opt-in, symmetry of control, and transparent accounting for all terms in the objective function. Loss of autonomy, measured by the mutual information between protocol levers and unconsented private state, must be \(\le 0\).

3.  **Minimal Control Law:** The protocol modifies system transition rates \(k_j\) only by shaping the context, not by direct force:
    \[
    k_j \;=\; k_j^0 \exp\!\big(\Delta K_\tau^{(j)}(T_a)-\Delta V_{\text{obs}}^{(j)}\big)
    \]
    where any intervention must publicly disclose its intended \(\Delta K_\tau\) and its exact cost \(\Delta V_{\text{obs}}\).

4.  **Falsifiable Criteria:** The protocol is invalid if it fails any of the following tests:
    - **T1 (Transparency):** Participants cannot predict the protocol's effect from its disclosures.
    - **T2 (Symmetry):** Participants cannot use the protocol's levers to induce a comparable effect on the system operator.
    - **T3 (Residue):** The measured Dark Residue \(\mathcal D\) exceeds its pre-declared budget, and the automated rollback fails.
    - **T4 (Coherence-not-Force):** Holding observation cost \(V_{\text{obs}}\) constant, \(\Delta T_a \le 0\).
    - **T5 (Hysteresis):** Observed hysteresis loops (lock-in effects) are not disclosed or are not reversible by the participant.

## Philosophy
The most profound implication is that ethics can be formalized as a set of computable constraints and costs within a physical control system. By defining non-manipulation, consent, and transparency as mathematical bounds (\(\mathcal C\)) and auditable cost functions (\(V_{\text{obs}}, \mathcal D\)) in the core optimization, the protocol reframes alignment not as a problem of enforcing a desired outcome, but of architecting an environment in which the desired outcome becomes the path of least resistance for willing participants. Influence ceases to be a unilateral force and is transformed into a symmetrical, legible, and consent-based negotiation of shared dynamics.
