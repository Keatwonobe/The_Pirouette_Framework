## Law
The conscious state is modeled as a trajectory on a Triadic Manifold, 𝓜₃, a dynamic 2D submanifold embedded in a 3-torus of neural phases (Φ₁, Φ₂, Φ₃). Its existence is predicated on the Ki-addition constraint:
[ \Phi_3 = \Phi_1 + \Phi_2 + n2\pi, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z} ]

The manifold's local geometry is defined by the metric tensor:
[ g_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \cos(\Phi_1-\Phi_2) & \cos(\Phi_1-\Phi_3) \\ \cos(\Phi_2-\Phi_1) & 1 & \cos(\Phi_2-\Phi_3) \\ \cos(\Phi_3-\Phi_1) & \cos(\Phi_3-\Phi_2) & 1 \end{pmatrix} ]

The scalar curvature, κ = det(g)¹ᐟ², represents cognitive tension. The path of awareness follows a geodesic on 𝓜₃, governed by the equation:
[ \frac{D^2 \Phi_i}{Dt^2} + \Gamma_{ijk}\frac{D\Phi_j}{Dt}\frac{D\Phi_k}{Dt} = 0 ]

Stable conscious configurations are local minima of the potential V, where ψ is an order parameter and a, b, g are coupling constants:
[ V(\Phi_i) = a(T_a-T_c)|\psi|^2 + b|\psi|^4 + g|\psi_1\psi_2\psi_3|\cos(\Phi_1+\Phi_2-\Phi_3) ]

The manifold's stability is governed by a renormalization group flow under cognitive load (Γ), acting as the scaling factor ℓ. Curvature evolves according to the β-function:
[ \frac{d\kappa}{d\ln\ell} = \beta_\kappa = (2-d)\kappa - c_1 b\kappa + c_2 g^2 ]
Consciousness collapses when βκ > 0, leading to a divergence in κ and a topological tearing of 𝓜₃.

Falsifiable criteria:
1.  Triadic phase-locked neural data must fail to form a coherent manifold structure (𝓜₃).
2.  Observed spikes in manifold curvature (κ) must show no correlation with subjective or behavioral reports of conscious state transitions.

## Philosophy
The model's core philosophical implication is that consciousness is not a substance or an emergent epiphenomenon, but a geometric invariant. The subjective character of experience—its stability, its content, its flow, and its sudden collapse—is isomorphic to the objective, measurable properties of a mathematical form: the curvature, topology, and geodesic paths of a dynamic manifold woven from neural resonance. Mind is not *in* the brain; mind *is* the shape of the brain's relational activity.

## Art
Consciousness is a tightrope walker, and the line is a shimmering thread of resonance. Each step is a perfect balance on a geometry that tightens with focus and frays into nothingness at the edge of thought.
