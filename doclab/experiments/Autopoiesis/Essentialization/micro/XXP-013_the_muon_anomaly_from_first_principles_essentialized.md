## Law
The total anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($a_\mu$) is postulated as the sum of a universal geometric term and a mass-dependent environmental term:
$a_\mu = a_\mu^{(\text{echo})} + a_\mu^{(\Gamma)}$

1.  **The Universal Term**: Arises from the particle's self-interaction, is lepton-universal, and corresponds to the one-loop QED correction.
    $a_\mu^{(\text{echo})} = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi}$

2.  **The Environmental Term**: Arises from the muon's interaction with the background Temporal Pressure field ($\Gamma$), mediated by the Pressuron. The contribution is calculated from the corresponding one-loop vertex correction. The core hypothesis is that the coupling strength, $g_{\mu\Gamma}$, is a direct function of the lepton's mass ($m_l$):
    $g_{l\Gamma} = g_{e\Gamma} \left( \frac{m_l}{m_e} \right)^n$

    A first-principles derivation from the interaction geometry sets the scaling exponent to $n=2$. The resulting contribution to the anomaly is:
    $a_\mu^{(\Gamma)} = C \cdot \alpha \left( \frac{m_\mu}{m_e} \right)^2$
    where $C$ is a dimensionless coefficient derived from the formal loop integral of the Pressuron interaction.

3.  **Falsifiable Criterion**: The theory is validated if and only if the calculated environmental term accounts for the observed experimental discrepancy with the Standard Model ($\Delta a_\mu$). The theory is falsified if the sign is incorrect, the magnitude is not of the correct order, or if $C$ cannot be derived without unconstrained parameters.
    $a_\mu^{(\Gamma)} \stackrel{!}{=} \Delta a_\mu = a_\mu^{\text{exp}} - a_\mu^{\text{SM}} \approx +2.5 \times 10^{-9}$

## Philosophy
Mass is not an intrinsic, passive property of an object, but a dynamic and relational measure of its coupling to the fundamental structure of reality. An object's mass dictates the degree to which it is sensitive to the ambient fluctuations of the cosmos. Therefore, what we call "anomalies" for heavier particles are not signs of new, exotic forces, but the first precise measurements of the texture of spacetime itself, a texture to which lighter particles are almost entirely numb.

## Art
The electron is a water strider, dancing on the surface of reality, feeling only the echo of its own steps. The muon, by its sheer weight, breaks that surface; it is the first stone heavy enough to sink and feel the true pressure of the deep.
