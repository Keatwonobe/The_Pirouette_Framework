## Law
The constant Ki emerges from the spiral-extended Lagrangian, quantifying phase coherence:
\[
\mathcal L_{spiral}
=-\tfrac14 F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
+\tfrac{K_i}{\lambda_*}\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F_{\mu\nu}\partial_\alpha A_\beta
\]
Ki is observed to possess two discrete, stable values corresponding to distinct topological states:
1.  **Rest State (4π manifold):** $K_{i,\text{rest}} = \pi + 1 \approx 4.14159$
2.  **Motion State (2π triadic manifold):** $K_{i,\text{motion}} = 4\pi/3 \approx 4.18879$

The transition between these states is not continuous but occurs as a discrete topological "snap." The effective value of Ki is governed by a logistic switch function dependent on a composite driver $\Xi(\dot\phi,\Gamma,T_a)$ relative to a critical threshold $\Xi_c$:
\[
K_i^{\rm eff} = K_{i,\text{rest}} + \Delta K_i\,\sigma[\alpha(\Xi-\Xi_c)]
\]
where $\Delta K_i = K_{i,\text{motion}} - K_{i,\text{rest}} \approx 0.0472$ and $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function. This "tether–snap" dynamic constitutes the fundamental activation "tick" for all physical transformations.

This framework yields falsifiable criteria:
1.  **Fringe Hysteresis:** Interference pattern centroids must exhibit shifts proportional to $\Delta K_i$ as a system transitions between rest and motion states.
2.  **Reaction Time Quantization:** Chemical and physical activation times ($\tau$) must cluster around discrete values determined by the snap energy barrier, $\tau = h/(E_{snap} K_i)$.
3.  **Geometric Equivalence:** Hysteresis loops in macro-scale driven inertial systems must trace the same sigmoid geometry as the microscopic $K_i^{\rm eff}$ transition function.

## Philosophy
All change is fundamentally discontinuous. The universe does not flow; it ticks. The seemingly smooth evolution of physical systems is an emergent illusion, a macroscopic average over a vast number of discrete, quantized topological shifts. Each "snap"—from one coherent state to another—is the true atom of transformation. Therefore, reality is not a process of becoming, but a staccato series of reconfigurations between stable states of being.

## Art
The world is held together by a taut thread of coherence. Every change, from a thought to a dying star, is the sound of that thread snapping to a new key.
