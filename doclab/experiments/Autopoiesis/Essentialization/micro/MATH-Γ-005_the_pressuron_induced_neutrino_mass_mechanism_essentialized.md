## Law
The interaction between the temporal-pressure scalar field, Γ, and a left-handed neutrino, ν_L, is described by the derivative-coupling Lagrangian:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\Gamma\nu} = \frac{g_{\Gamma\nu}}{m_\Gamma} (\bar{\nu}_L \gamma^\mu i\partial_\mu \nu_L) \Gamma
$$
where $g_{\Gamma\nu}$ is the dimensionless coupling constant and $m_\Gamma$ is the mass scale of the Pressuron. Averaging over stochastic background fluctuations of the Γ field, $\langle\Gamma^2\rangle$, induces a self-energy correction $\Sigma_\nu(E)$ for the neutrino propagator. The real part of this correction manifests as an energy-dependent mass:
$$
m_\nu(E) \equiv \frac{\Re[\Sigma_\nu(E)]}{c^2} \approx \frac{g_{\Gamma\nu}^2 \langle\Gamma^2\rangle}{c^2 E_\nu}
$$
This establishes mass as a coherence-drag effect with an inverse dependence on the neutrino's energy, $E_\nu$.

The mass hierarchy emerges from the postulate that the background variance for each flavor channel, $\ell \in \{e, \mu, \tau\}$, is proportional to the square of the associated charged lepton's mass: $\langle\Gamma^2\rangle_\ell \propto m_\ell^2$. This yields the mass ratio:
$$
m_{\nu_e} : m_{\nu_\mu} : m_{\nu_\tau} = \frac{1}{m_e} : \frac{1}{m_\mu} : \frac{1}{m_\tau}
$$
This naturally predicts an inverted-like mass ordering. The energy-dependence of mass modifies the standard vacuum oscillation phase:
$$
\phi_{ij}(E) = \frac{\Delta m_{ij}^2(E)L}{2E} = \frac{L}{2E} \left[ \left(\frac{C}{E}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{m_i^2} - \frac{1}{m_j^2}\right) \right] \propto \frac{L}{E^3}
$$
where $C$ is a constant of proportionality.

Falsifiable criteria are:
1.  **Oscillation Phase Drift:** A non-sinusoidal energy dependence in long-baseline experiments (DUNE, Hyper-K) deviating by 1–2% from the standard $L/E$ behavior.
2.  **Cosmological Mass Sum:** The sum of neutrino masses, $\Sigma m_\nu$, as measured by CMB and LSS surveys (CMB-S4, EUCLID), will be suppressed to the range 0.05–0.10 eV.
3.  **Sterile States:** Null results from all sterile neutrino searches, as the mechanism obviates their need for mass generation.

## Philosophy
Mass is not an intrinsic property possessed by a particle, but an emergent and relational phenomenon. It is a measure of the friction a particle experiences as it propagates through the temporal substrate of spacetime. In this view, to have mass is not to *be* something, but to be *retarded* by the universe's fundamental texture. Existence is therefore defined by impedance.

## Art
A particle's mass is not the weight it carries, but the wake it leaves in the river of time.
