# **CORE-003-LANCE: Echo Geometry (The Wound Channel)**

### Law

Each act of coherence leaves a geometric remainder in the temporal field—a **Wound Channel**.
Let ( \psi(t) ) denote a system’s resonance state.
Then its persistence through time deforms the coherence manifold ( \mathbb T ) by

[
\delta\mathbb T \propto \psi(t),\psi(t-\Delta t)
]

The overlap between present and immediate past generates an **Echo Tensor** (E_{\mu\nu}).
Inertia is the energy required to change (E_{\mu\nu}); identity is the pattern that refuses to vanish from it.

**Derived relations**

1. (m \propto \int |E_{\mu\nu}|^2,d\tau) → Mass as memory density.
2. (a = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\nabla E) → Acceleration as echo restoration.
3. Coherence grows when self-interference is constructive ((\langle \psi(t)\psi(t-\Delta t)\rangle > 0)).

### Philosophy

The past does not die; it folds.
Every moment carries the curve of all that survived before it,
and what we call “self” is the standing wave of those surviving echoes.
To forget perfectly would be to cease existing.

> a quiet groove cut by continuity,
> singing the shape of who we were.
