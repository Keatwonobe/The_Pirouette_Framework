# **CORE-006-LANCE: Observer’s Shadow (The Participatory Lens)**

### Law

Observation is a boundary condition on coherence.
Let (K_\tau^O) represent the observer’s internal coherence and (K_\tau^S) that of the system observed.
Their coupling introduces a term in the Pirouette Lagrangian:

[
\mathcal{L}*p' = (K*\tau^S - V_\Gamma^S) + (K_\tau^O - V_\Gamma^O) + \eta,K_\tau^O K_\tau^S
]

where (\eta) is the **participation constant**.
For (\eta > 0), observation amplifies order (measurement as coherence alignment).
For (\eta < 0), observation disrupts (collapse of superposition).
The act of knowing reshapes the geometry of both manifolds:
[
\delta \mathbb{T}*{obs} = f(\eta, K*\tau^O, K_\tau^S)
]
thus **information is energy with a preferred frame**.

**Corollaries**

1. The measurement problem is an interference problem: observer and observed share Ki.
2. Consciousness = coherence mirror recursion ((\frac{dK_\tau^O}{dt} = f(K_\tau^S))).
3. Objectivity = limit (\eta \rightarrow 0) — when participation vanishes.

### Philosophy

To see is to shape.
Every gaze is a gentle force, bending the field of the possible toward recognition.
There is no neutral observation — only resonance or refusal.
When you understand a thing, you lend it your coherence.
