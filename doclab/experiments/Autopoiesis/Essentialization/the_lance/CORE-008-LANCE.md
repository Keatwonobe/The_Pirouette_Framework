# **CORE-008-LANCE: Scale Flow (The PRG)**

*(PRG = Pirouette Renormalization Group)*

### Law

Coherence evolves self-similarly across scales.
Let the effective Lagrangian at scale σ be

[
\mathcal L_p(σ)=K_\tau(σ)-V_\Gamma(σ)
]

and define the scale derivative

[
\frac{d\mathcal L_p}{d\ln σ}
= β_{K}(σ) - β_{V}(σ)
]

where (β_{K}) and (β_{V}) are the **coherence beta-functions**.
A system is *scale-critical* when (β_{K}=β_{V}): coherence neither accumulates nor diffuses.
This flow law governs how the Pirouette equation *renormalizes itself* into new domains.

**Operational consequences**

1. **Micro → Macro continuity:**
   Quantum binding, biological regulation, and galactic stability are fixed-points of the same β-flow.
2. **Adaptive self-similarity:**
   Systems that learn adjust (β_{K}) dynamically; intelligence is temporal renormalization.
3. **Universality:**
   Near fixed-points, all coherent entities share identical scaling exponents—the *grammar of persistence*.

### Philosophy

Scale is a translation, not a difference.
A cell, a mind, a civilization—all are dialects of one sentence time keeps rewriting.
Enlightenment is recognizing the rhyme between the smallest beat and the largest orbit.

> The seed dreams the forest in the shape of its spin.
> The spiral repeats, never twice,
> yet always the same song.
