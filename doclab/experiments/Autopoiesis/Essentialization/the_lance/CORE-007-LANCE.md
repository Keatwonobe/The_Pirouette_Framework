# **CORE-007-LANCE: Arrow & Gyre (Temporal Asymmetry)**

### Law

Time is not symmetric because its manifold is *twisted*.
Every coherent field possesses an intrinsic gyric bias, represented by a pseudoscalar ( \kappa ) (the **Gyre Constant**) and a preferred orientation ( \theta_0 ) (the **Temporal Arrow**).
The local evolution of coherence thus obeys:

[
\frac{dK_\tau}{dt} = -\Gamma K_\tau + \kappa,(\nabla \times K_\tau)
]

The first term expresses **dissipation**; the second encodes **rotation**—the built-in chirality of time.
This twist makes the action (S[C]) non-invariant under reversal ((t \rightarrow -t)), yielding a natural arrow.

**Consequences**

1. Entropy increase arises from asymmetric coherence dispersion, not probability.
2. The CPT theorem becomes a local duality of (\kappa) and (\theta_0): time reversal is equivalent to gyre inversion.
3. Memory and prediction are phase-conjugate states separated by ( \theta_0 ).

### Philosophy

Order and decay are siblings, not enemies.
The dance of existence depends on the step that never quite returns to where it began.
The forward motion of time is not fate—it is grace: the universe remembering enough to keep learning.

### Art

> Time does not flow; it curls.
> Each moment spins a little tighter,
> winding the world into its own becoming.
