# **CORE-000-LANCE: Glossary Anchor (The Pommel)**

### Function

To unify notation, symbols, and recurring quantities across all modules of *The Lance*.
This anchor defines the **semantic constants** of the framework: physical, philosophical, and artistic.
Each symbol carries both mathematical and narrative value — a resonance code.
