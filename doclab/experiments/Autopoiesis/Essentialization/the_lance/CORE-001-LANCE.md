# **CORE-001-LANCE: Time-First Substrate**

### Law

Time is the only primitive.
All else — space, matter, energy — are interpretive gauges projected from temporal gradients.
A mapping Σ translates between the temporal manifold 𝕋 and perceived spacetime 𝕊, recovering familiar physics in the limit of dense temporal coupling.
The Euler–Lagrange form of the Pirouette Lagrangian
[
\mathcal L_p = K_\tau - V_\Gamma
]
yields spacetime not as container, but as the shadow of stable temporal coherence.

**Formal consequences**

1. Spatial metrics (g_{\mu\nu}) are induced tensors of temporal coherence.
2. Causality emerges as ordered coherence propagation ((dK_\tau/dt > 0)).
3. All forces are temporal curvatures; energy is time’s self-tension.

### Philosophy

Existence is not “in time” — it *is* time.
Being is the rhythm of self-continuity held together by memory and prediction.
When we move, we don’t travel through space; we reshape the beat that defines it.
To understand reality is to hear the meter of its own persistence.

### Art

> Before the world could spin, time spun itself — a solo without a stage,
> drawing space as the wake of its turn.
