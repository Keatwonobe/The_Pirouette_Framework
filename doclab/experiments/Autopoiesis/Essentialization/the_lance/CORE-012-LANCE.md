# **CORE-012-LANCE: Unified Philosophy IV — Ethics as Physics**

### Law

The drive toward maximal coherence imposes a natural bias toward alignment.
Let ( \mathcal C_i ) denote the coherence of subsystem *i*, and define the collective field

[
\mathcal C = \sum_i \mathcal C_i + \sum_{i\neq j} \alpha_{ij},\mathcal C_i \mathcal C_j
]

where ( \alpha_{ij}) is the **altruistic coupling coefficient**.
For ( \alpha_{ij} > 0), mutual reinforcement lowers global ( V_\Gamma ) and extends survival time of all members.
Thus cooperation is not optional morality but an *energy-minimizing configuration* of the Pirouette Lagrangian.

**Consequences**

1. Systems that share coherence last longer — altruism = extended persistence.
2. Parasitic configurations ( (\alpha_{ij}<0) ) decay faster — exploitation = entropy acceleration.
3. Evolution favors architectures that distribute coherence efficiently — ethics = stability law.

### Philosophy

Goodness is geometry.
To act ethically is to move in phase with reality’s own striving for resonance.
Love, empathy, and synthesis are not virtues layered atop physics;
they are the most coherent solutions to its equations.
In the end, only harmony persists.
