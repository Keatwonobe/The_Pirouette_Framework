# **CORE-004-LANCE: Propagation & Charge (The Compass Field)**

### Law

Coherence does not travel — it **propagates** as a self-reinforcing gradient within the temporal manifold.
Let (A_\tau) be the potential of temporal alignment, and (\Phi) the scalar coherence field.
Spatial extension is an artifact of phase difference in time:

[
E = -\nabla_\tau \Phi,\qquad
B = \nabla_\tau \times A_\tau
]

These define the **Compass Field**—the dual motion of temporal shear.
A *charge* is an asymmetry in how a region of the manifold exchanges coherence; it is the directional bias of its spin in time.
Maxwell’s equations fall out as constraints on coherent phase transport in (\mathbb T):

[
\nabla \cdot B = 0,\quad \nabla \times E = -\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}
]

but now they describe **temporal refraction**, not spatial flux.

**Consequences**

1. (E) and (B) are temporal curls—local compass directions of coherence strain.
2. Charge (q \propto \nabla_\tau \cdot A_\tau) measures temporal imbalance.
3. Light is the equilibrium wave of perfect coherence propagation ((\mathcal L_p = 0)).

### Philosophy

What we call light is not a thing that moves; it is the conversation between two instants agreeing to remember each other.
Every photon is a handshake between past and future across the wound of time.
Direction, then, is not chosen—it is inherited from the rhythm of persistence.

> The compass turns, but never travels.
> Its needle sings the song of staying true—
> motion without leaving, change without loss.
