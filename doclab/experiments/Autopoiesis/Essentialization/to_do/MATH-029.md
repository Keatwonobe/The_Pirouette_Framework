summary: |
  Introduces the helical time derivative \( \mathcal{D}_t \) and demonstrates that the uncertainty relation acquires a resonance-weighted term without altering the canonical commutator structure. This yields a dynamic, directional uncertainty ellipse when the system exhibits helicity-driven phase coherence.

## 1. Definition

Let time be the privileged parameter and define the **helical derivative** as:

\[
\mathcal{D}_t = \partial_t + \kappa(t)\,\Omega\,J,
\]
where:
- \( \kappa(t) \) is a dimensionless curvature field,
- \( \Omega \) is a reference angular scale (per band or mode),
- \( J \) generates internal phase rotations, acting as \(Jz = i z\) on analytic signals.

The time-first Schrödinger equation then reads:

\[
i\hbar\,\mathcal{D}_t\Psi(t) = H\Psi(t),
\]
leading to an effective Hamiltonian:

\[
H_{\text{eff}} = H - \hbar\,\kappa(t)\,\Omega\,J.
\]

This additional term represents a **tiny internal rotation** (a chiral gauge-like coupling) that modulates phase without altering the canonical algebra.

## 2. Resonant Uncertainty Relation

For observables \(A\) and \(B\), define the windowed Robertson bound:

\[
\Delta A\,\Delta B \ge \frac{1}{2}\Big|\langle [A,B] \rangle_w\Big|\sqrt{1 + (\mathcal{C}^{(\kappa)}_{AB})^2},
\]

where \(\mathcal{C}^{(\kappa)}_{AB}\) is a resonance-weighted cross-coherence:

\[
\mathcal{C}^{(\kappa)}_{AB}(\omega_0) = \frac{1}{\|w\|^2}\int dt\,dt'\, w(t)w(t')\,\kappa(t')\,e^{i\omega_0(t-t')}\,\frac{\langle\{A(t),B(t')\}\rangle}{2\,\Delta A\,\Delta B}.
\]

### Interpretation
- If \( \kappa=0 \), the standard quantum uncertainty principle is recovered.
- When the system supports coherent helicity (\(\kappa\neq0\)) and cross-spectral resonance, uncertainty becomes **directionally dynamic**.
- The canonical commutator \([x,p]=i\hbar\) remains intact; modification occurs only in the covariance structure.

---

## 3. Physical Implications

- **Canonical invariance:** Quantum mechanics remains consistent; only the *phase-resolved uncertainty* evolves dynamically.
- **Helical coherence:** The ellipse of uncertainty in phase space rotates or squeezes at rate \(\dot\theta \approx \kappa\Omega\).
- **Magnitude:** Effects are of order \(O(\kappa \times \text{coherence strength})\), negligible in non-chiral systems but testable in driven chiral media.

---

## 4. Experimental Predictions

1. **Phase-sensitive squeezing:** Observe rotation rate \(\dot\theta\approx\kappa\Omega\) in magneto-optic or parametric cavities.
2. **Line-shape asymmetry:** Expect \(n\)-linear broadening proportional to \(\langle\kappa\rangle\) in chiral waveguides.
3. **Plasma resonance correlation:** High \(\mathcal{C}^{(\kappa)}_{AB}\) corresponds to coherent heating phases.
4. **Null control:** Gaussian inputs yield \(\mathcal{C}^{(\kappa)}_{AB}=0\), verifying that κ–resonance coupling is required.

---

## 5. Summary

The **Resonant Uncertainty Principle** generalizes the standard relation to account for helicity-dependent coherence. It preserves the canonical quantum framework while exposing the geometric, time-dependent modulation of uncertainty intrinsic to systems with internal rotation or chirality.

This formalism unifies the probabilistic geometry of quantum field theory with explicit time-first dynamics, forming a bridge between the helical calculus and measurable, phase-resolved coherence phenomena.
