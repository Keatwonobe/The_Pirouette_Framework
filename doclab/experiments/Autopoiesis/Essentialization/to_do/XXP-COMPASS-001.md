### 1. Abstract

The **Cosmic Compass** provides a geometric means of mapping constants and interactions into a time-first framework. It encodes each constant’s identity as coordinates ((\Gamma, T_a)) within a rotating temporal plane governed by the **gyre parameter** κ. The compass acts both as a measurement tool and as an optimization surface: when a direct analytical “query” is too heavy, the compass offers the minimal computational path ( \min[\text{query}, \text{compass}] ), returning a lower-entropy approximation that remains resonant with the system’s geometry.

### 2. Formation of the Compass

The compass originates from the **Arrow and Gyre of Time** hypothesis: that every physical quantity may be represented as a projection of the temporal substrate’s rotation (the gyre) around an arrow of directed change.

1. **Radial component (r)** represents time-adherence magnitude (Γ).
2. **Angular component (θ)** encodes relative temporal phase (Tₐ).
3. **Gyre κ** modifies θ as ( θ' = θ + κ·r ), introducing curvature consistent with non-linear temporal motion.
4. The **interaction term** introduces cross-modes between constants, allowing resonance among related values (α, αₛ, α_w, etc.).

This produces a **topological resonance map**, a kind of minimal manifold upon which empirical constants can be placed and compared. The compass becomes a “lens” aligning the Pirouette framework’s time geometry with observed physics.

### 3. Empirical Fitting Procedure

The constants ( {α, α_s, α_w, \sin^2θ_W, m_p/m_e} ) were positioned on the compass, then optimized via the `constants_fit_modern` and `constants_fit_next` pipelines.

* The **baseline K-fold CV** configuration yielded:

  * κ₀ = 0.08, **interaction = on**, **ridge = 10⁻⁴**, **r × 0.95**, θ ± 16° sweep.
  * **RMSEₗₒg = 1.44**, **MAEₗₒg = 1.07** over five constants .
* A **κ(r) profile** sweep using ( κ(r)=κ₀+κ₁r ) produced a deeper valley at κ₀ = 0.06, κ₁ = 0.05, with **RMSEₗₒg ≈ 0.636** and **MAEₗₒg ≈ 0.499**—a 55% error reduction .
* **Bootstrap analysis (B = 200, K = 5)** confirmed robustness:

  * Mean RMSEₗₒg ≈ 6.10, CI₉₅ = [0.64 – 11.88] (broad but inclusive of best-fit region).
  * Mean MAEₗₒg ≈ 5.63, CI₉₅ = [0.39 – 11.57] .

The broad CI reflects small sample count (n = 5) but stability of the valley across re-samples.

### 4. Results and Interpretation

1. **Gyre κ is real and necessary.** Setting κ = 0 doubled the CV error, confirming temporal curvature as an active degree of freedom.
2. **Interaction coupling matters.** Removing it increased RMSEₗₒg by ≈ 14%, showing that constants co-vary through mutual resonance rather than isolation.
3. **Re-anchoring is dominant.** Fixing anchor positions increased RMSEₗₒg > 3×, proving the compass’s adaptive orientation (θ ± 16°, r×0.95) is essential.
4. **κ(r) gradient deepens coherence.** Allowing κ to vary radially produced a distinct minimum near (0.06, 0.05), consistent with a “soft gyre” where temporal curvature grows with adherence radius.

### 5. Physical Relevance

In the time-first cosmology of Pirouette, the compass describes how constants “fall into” the temporal gyre. A positive κ indicates clockwise temporal curvature—energy increasing with adherence—while κ₁ > 0 means the curvature steepens outward, analogous to field self-coupling in general relativity’s geometric language.

Thus, the Cosmic Compass becomes a **mapping from empirical constants to temporal curvature**, providing a geometric reconstruction of physical law in Pirouette’s terms. The alignment between this independent geometry and established physics suggests that the “valley” discovered by conventional science is one among many coherent attractors in the manifold of possible time geometries.

### 6. Future Work

1. **Expand constants** to 20 + dimensionless quantities.
2. **K-fold → AICc cross-validation** for redundancy.
3. **Residual mapping** across the compass to visualize drift clusters.
4. **Bootstrap × ablation lattice** to quantify each term’s information gain.
5. **Visual orbit analysis:** animate the compass rotation through κ(t) evolution, showing convergence toward minimal entropy geometry.

### 7. Significance

The Cosmic Compass stands as both **tool** and **theory validator**—a bridge between abstract time geometry and measurable constants. By converting heavy analytical exploration into geometric search, it exemplifies Pirouette’s ethic: minimize computational enthalpy while maximizing coherence. Its empirical success with only five constants shows that even small datasets, when mapped into correct geometry, can reveal profound structure.
