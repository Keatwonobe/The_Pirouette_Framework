summary: |
  RT-007 extends the Thermo-Informational Arrow into a graph-theoretic structure:
  an Entropy Network (EN). Each node represents a localized system carrying energy,
  entropy, and information; each edge represents a channel of exchange obeying the
  retrograde symmetry ΔS₊ + ΔS₋ = 0. Entropy flows define causal orientation, and
  coherent feedback loops define the emergence of time itself as a negotiated global phase.

definitions:
  Node:    N_i = (E_i, S_i, I_i, τ_i)
  Edge:    e_{ij} = (Φ_{ij}, ε_{ij}) linking N_i ↔ N_j
  Entropic flux: J_{ij} = dS_i/dt = −dS_j/dt = k_B ε_{ij} Φ_{ij}
  Information flux: J^I_{ij} = −J_{ij} / k_B
  Temporal phase: τ_i evolves by dτ_i/dt = Σ_j ε_{ij} sin(φ_{ij})

network_equations:
  1. Conservation: Σ_j J_{ij} = 0   (local entropy balance)
  2. Coherence: ∂_t φ_{ij} = ω_{ij} + ε_{ij} sin(φ_{ji}−φ_{ij})
  3. Causal emergence: sign(⟨J_{ij}⟩) defines local arrow of time.
  4. Global invariance: Σ_i S_i(t) = constant ⇒ ΔS_total = 0.

effective_potential:
  The Entropy Network Lagrangian:
     𝓛_EN = Σ_{ij} [½ ε_{ij}(∂_tφ_{ij})² − k_B T_iT_j cos(φ_{ij})]
  yielding coupled phase dynamics analogous to Kuramoto oscillators,
  but with entropy flux substituting for frequency detuning.

retrograde_duality:
  Each edge has a conjugate:
     e_{ij}⁺ ↔ e_{ij}⁻  such that J_{ij}⁺ = −J_{ij}⁻
  Entropy creation on 𝒯₊ ↔ entropy annihilation on 𝒯₋.
  In the full network, global coherence is maintained through paired causal circuits.

emergent_behavior:
  - **Causal alignment:** Nodes synchronize phase (φ_ij → constant) when mutual entropy
    production exceeds threshold κ_sync = k_B ⟨ε_{ij}T_iT_j⟩.
  - **Retrograde windows:** When local entropy gradient crosses zero, retrograde loops
    form, manifesting as memory, recursion, or reflection.
  - **Forward reinforcement:** Persistent positive ∂S_i/∂t establishes macroscopic causality.

macroscopic interpretation:
  - Biological, computational, and societal systems correspond to subgraphs of the global EN.
  - Cooperation = entropic coherence; conflict = destructive phase interference.
  - The universe evolves by distributing entropy production across nodes
    to minimize localized gradient (Principle of Distributed Dissipation).

predictions:
  P1: Correlated entropy fluctuations between distant nodes (ΔS_iΔS_j < 0) at coherence scale τ_c
      indicate active retrograde feedback loops.
  P2: Networks near equilibrium exhibit 1/f noise spectra — hallmark of time-symmetric exchange.
  P3: Information-rich subsystems (large |I_i|/S_i) stabilize global time orientation.

falsification:
  F1: Absence of entropy–information anticorrelation across coupled systems falsifies EN validity.
  F2: If global ΔS_total ≠ 0 in isolated systems beyond numerical noise, retrograde coherence broken.
  F3: In biological analogs, uncorrelated entropy minimization across interacting agents contradicts EN hypothesis.

simulation_framework:
  - Represent N_i as oscillators with S_i(t), T_i(t), φ_i(t).
  - Evolve via coupled ODEs:  dS_i/dt = Σ_j k_B ε_{ij} sin(φ_j−φ_i)
  - Monitor synchronization and net ΔS_total.
  - Observable outcome: self-organized directionality and entropy–information coherence.

extensions:
  - Integrate with DDE/FRACTAL_AR pipelines for empirical network embedding.
  - Link RT-007 with PPS-ALTR-001 to model altruism as entropic phase coherence between agents.
  - Extend to quantum networks via density operator ρ_i with Tr(ρ_i log ρ_j) coupling term.

interfaces:
  - RT-006: supplies dual-sheet entropy equations.
  - RT-008: develops continuum field limit (information pressure tensor).
  - DYNA-013 / MATH-021: provide dynamical systems formalism.
  - PPS-ALTR-001: sociophysical resonance of entropy networks.

notes:
  - The Entropy Network reframes time as an emergent collective oscillation,
    whose stability defines reality’s perceived continuity.
  - Synchronization across nodes corresponds to “forward time”; desynchronization
    (retrograde pockets) underlies memory, recursion, and prediction.
  - This module establishes the basis for the next formalization: RT-008,
    the Information Pressure Field, where entropy flux becomes geometry.
