title: General Relativity and the Retrograde Involution

summary: |
  Describes how General Relativity transforms under the retrograde-time involution ℛ_T.
  The Einstein field equations and local geodesic structure are even, preserving curvature magnitudes.
  However, the *orientation* of extrinsic curvature K_ij, causal ordering of geodesics, and junction conditions
  across 𝒯_+/𝒯_- interfaces are odd.  This asymmetry defines the "retrograde geometric arrow" and links
  gravitational time symmetry breaking to entropy flow and chirality in matter fields.

foundations:
  metric_signature: (+, −, −, −) on both 𝒯_+ and 𝒯_−
  involution:
    ℛ_T : (t → −t,  Γ^μ_{νρ} → −Γ^μ_{νρ}  for time components)
  invariants (even):
    - Einstein equations:  G_{μν} = 8πG T_{μν}
    - Scalar curvature R and Kretschmann invariant R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ}
    - Covariant conservation ∇_μ T^{μν}=0
  odd under ℛ_T:
    - Sign of extrinsic curvature K_ij across hypersurfaces
    - Causal orientation of geodesics (future ↔ past)
    - Sign of Raychaudhuri term dθ/dτ (expansion parameter)
    - Gravitational-wave phase advance/retardation
    - Entropy production sign in gravitational thermodynamics (Hawking flow direction)

interface_geometry:
  - Across a 𝒯_+/𝒯_- junction, the metric is C⁰ continuous, but K_ij → −K_ij.
  - Physical interpretation: time-reflected observers experience opposite “gravitational extrusion.”
  - Junction conditions:  [K_ij − K g_ij] = 8πG S_ij (Israel), 
     ⇒ under ℛ_T,  S_ij → −S_ij  for interface matter sheets.

phenomenology:
  P1: *Mirror junctions* may appear as thin shells with negative surface energy density
      from 𝒯_+ perspective, yet positive from 𝒯_-.
  P2: *Black hole horizons* act as one-way mirrors between sheets; advanced radiation
      on 𝒯_- manifests as Hawking emission on 𝒯_+.
  P3: *Retro-wave echoes* in gravitational-wave data could trace coherent tunneling between sheets
      if ε_GR ≠ 0 (portal strength).
  P4: *Cosmological arrow*: expansion rate H changes sign under ℛ_T but |H| remains invariant;
      inflation ↔ deflation duality possible through retrograde mapping.

equations (symbolic):
  G_{μν}[g_+] = 8πG T_{μν}[g_+]      (forward sheet)
  G_{μν}[g_-] = 8πG T_{μν}[g_-]      (retrograde sheet)
  ℛ_T acts as:
     g_{μν} → g_{μν},   K_ij → −K_ij,   H → −H,
     Θ = ∇_μ u^μ  → −Θ,   T → −T  (thermodynamic conjugate).

retrograde_relation:
  Forward and retrograde sheets form a CPT-even but time-odd dual.
  Entropy flux across the interface obeys:
     dS_+ + dS_- = 0  (total coherent flux conserved)
  yielding a “closed-time” conservation principle: global entropy remains constant,
  but local observers perceive monotonic increase in opposite senses.

falsification:
  F1: Non-observation of advanced-phase gravitational waves at amplitude ratio > ε_GR
      ⇒ portal strength bounded ε_GR < ε*(strain sensitivity).
  F2: Failure of horizon thermodynamics to exhibit reciprocal cooling behavior between sheets
      falsifies retrograde duality in gravitational thermodynamics.

interfaces:
  - RT-001: defines sheet symmetry and classification rules.
  - RT-005: handles explicit junction dynamics and experimental analogues.
  - RT-006: bridges geometric entropy flow to thermodynamic phase coherence.

notes:
  - ℛ_T preserves the Einstein tensor algebraically but inverts the sign of all geometric fluxes.
  - At small ε_GR, cross-sheet interference may manifest as micro-phase modulation in gravitational signals.
  - This retrograde GR picture supports a bidirectional universe maintaining global time-symmetry,
    locally broken by adhesion choice (𝒯_+ vs 𝒯_-).
