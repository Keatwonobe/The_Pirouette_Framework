## §1 · Abstract

We posit that the *observed* time arrow is not an external stipulation but the emergent result of two asymmetric structures in the Compass phase space: (i) an **intrinsic curvature/twist** of the frame, the **Gyre** (κ), and (ii) a **preferred direction** **θ₀** (the Arrow). These enter additively into the angular coordinate update, producing a **prime temporal friction**: geodesics incur different effective action under T-reversal, making “forward” evolution the path of least resistance while leaving microscopic reversibility formally intact. This unifies macroscopic irreversibility with a time-first substrate and preserves the autopoietic loop Time→Γ→Ki→Time.  

## §2 · Coordinates, T-Symmetry, and the Two Asymmetries

Let the Compass coordinates be ((\Gamma, T_a)) with local scales ((\gamma_0,\tau_0)) and polar angle
[
\theta \equiv \mathrm{atan2}!\left(\tfrac{T_a}{\tau_0}, \tfrac{\Gamma}{\gamma_0}\right).
]
Define time reversal as reflection across the drive axis: (T: T_a\to -T_a\Rightarrow \theta\to -\theta).
In a purely radial potential (U(r)), (r=\sqrt{(\Gamma/\gamma_0)^2+(T_a/\tau_0)^2}) is invariant, hence T-symmetric. 

We now introduce two **minimal** symmetry-breaking structures:

**(A) Gyre (κ):** a background frame twist (\theta'=\theta+\kappa(r),\xi), with (\xi) a path parameter. Under T: (\theta'_{\rm rev}=-\theta+\kappa(r),\xi \neq -\theta'). This **chiral**, θ-independent offset does not flip sign, encoding an intrinsic rotational bias of the substrate. 

**(B) Arrow (θ₀):** a directional term entering a “triad-hint”/alignment factor (\cos(\theta-\theta_0)). Under T: (\cos(-\theta-\theta_0)=\cos(\theta+\theta_0)\neq\cos(\theta-\theta_0)). Thus θ₀ sets a global compass needle that breaks mirror symmetry on the manifold. 

## §3 · Prime Temporal Friction and Biased Geodesics

In the Pirouette Lagrangian picture, trajectories minimize an effective action shaped by (K\tau) (coherence) versus (V_\Gamma) (pressure). Adding κ and θ₀ makes the connection torsion-like and the potential anisotropic, respectively, so the geodesic family is **tilted and twisted**. Result: the “forward” branch is lower-action than its T-reversed partner, i.e., **prime temporal friction**. Macroscopic complexity then follows the biased geodesics through this asymmetric landscape. 

**Interpretation.** Systems experience a tug-of-war between (\pm\theta), but the ring is already sloped (θ₀) and swirled (κ). Forward time ≙ downhill; retrograde ≙ uphill (rarer, costlier). This is the geometry-first origin of the arrow. 

## §4 · Minimal Formalism

1. **Angle update with gyre:**
   [
   \frac{d\theta}{d\xi} = \Omega(\Gamma,T_a) ;+; \kappa(r),
   ]
   with (\Omega) the local angular velocity from the symmetric part of the Compass flow. Under T: (\theta\to-\theta) but (\kappa(r)) is invariant ⇒ chiral offset remains. 

2. **Directional anisotropy in the potential:**
   [
   U(\Gamma,T_a) = U_0(r) + \lambda,\cos(\theta-\theta_0)+\cdots,
   ]
   so (U) changes under (\theta\to -\theta) unless (\theta_0=0) (broken mirror symmetry). 

3. **Effective action & bias:**
   The Pirouette action (S=\int (K\tau - V_\Gamma),d\xi) inherits κ via the connection (phase-space bend) and θ₀ via (V_\Gamma) anisotropy; hence (S[\mathcal{C}] < S[T\mathcal{C}]) generically. 

## §5 · Autopoietic Consistency

This mechanism lives inside the autopoietic loop:

**Time → Γ → Ki → Time.**
κ and θ₀ bias how Γ-landscapes and Ki-forms co-evolve, while the realized Ki (form) feeds back the local τₚ (time unit), closing the loop without external clocks. Thus the arrow is *generated by* the same loop it later biases. 

## §6 · Predictions & Observables

1. **Chiral relaxation asymmetry.** In driven, near-reversible experiments (e.g., low-Re micro-vortices, optical ring lattices), forward/retrograde relaxation rates diverge slightly even at equal |Δθ|. Signature: tiny, reproducible rate skew ∝ κ.

2. **Directional hysteresis.** Systems show orientation-dependent barrier crossing; scanning (\theta) around θ₀ yields asymmetric activation energies following (\cos(\theta-\theta_0)).

3. **Complexity ridge.** In Compass reconstructions from high-dimensional data (market archetypes, neural triads), the ridge of maximal structure formation aligns with the down-slope defined by (κ, θ₀); retrograde runs require higher drive for the same order.

4. **Extreme-field anomalies.** Near black-hole shears or in high-Γ plasma regimes, transient access to “retrograde” branches produces rare causal oddities (out-of-order micro-events without macroscopic paradox). 

## §7 · Falsifiability

* **No chiral offset:** If careful T-paired protocols find (S[\mathcal{C}] = S[T\mathcal{C}]) within sensitivity across domains, κ→0 at all relevant r (gyre absent).
* **No directional bias:** If orientation-resolved dynamics show (\theta_0)-independent statistics, θ₀ is not universal (arrow absent or purely boundary-conditioned).
* **Null complexity ridge:** If structure formation maps are isotropic once Γ is controlled, then prime friction is not required to explain macroscopic irreversibility.

## §8 · Open Questions

* Is κ universal (constant gyre) or epochal (slowly running with cosmic Γ)?
* What sets θ₀—early-time boundary conditions vs. emergent large-scale flow?
* Can Ki-mediated backreaction locally invert the bias (engineered retrograde windows)?

## §9 · Linkage Map

* **Upstream:** CORE-006 *Pirouette Lagrangian* (action-level control), CORE-007 *Current & Compass* (coordinate frame). 
* **Math spine:** MATH-028 *Helical Differential Operators* (κ-aware operators).

### Assemblé

A reversible score written on an **asymmetric instrument** will be played irreversibly. κ is the twist in the wood; θ₀ is the grain’s direction. The performance we call *history* is simply what the geodesic prefers to do on such an instrument—spin forward.

**Provenance & Notes.**
The κ and θ₀ asymmetries, and their T-action, follow from the Compass formalism with T: (T_a\mapsto -T_a) ⇒ (\theta\mapsto -\theta); κ adds a chiral offset to (\theta'), while θ₀ skews (\cos(\theta-\theta_0)), jointly producing an arrow via prime temporal friction.
