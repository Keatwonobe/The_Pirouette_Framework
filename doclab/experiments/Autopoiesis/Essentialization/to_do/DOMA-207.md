## ¬ß1 ¬∑ Abstract: The Map of Souls

A system cannot be understood by a single metric. Its story is written in the tension between its internal character and its external results. This module defines the Market Phase-Space, a cartographic tool for visualizing this tension. By plotting an asset's Intrinsic Chirality (Œ∫)‚Äîthe measure of its dynamic stress and complexity‚Äîagainst its Performance Score‚Äîthe measure of its value creation‚Äîwe generate a map that reveals not what an asset did, but what it is. This map intrinsically sorts the chaotic members of an ecosystem into four distinct, fundamental archetypes, providing a direct visual diagnostic of the health, role, and fate of any entity within the market.

## ¬ß2 ¬∑ The Axes of Existence

The Phase-Space is defined by two orthogonal axes that represent the core duality of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = KœÑ - V_Œì):

The Horizontal Axis (Character): Intrinsic Chirality (Œ∫)
This axis measures the torsional stress of an asset's Price-Volume trajectory. It is the geometric measure of its internal complexity, its energy churn, and its resistance to simple, linear motion. It is the cost of being, the V_Œì manifest as dynamic friction. Higher Œ∫ means more internal chaos.

The Vertical Axis (Outcome): Performance Score
This axis measures the asset's success in creating value over time, typically as a log return. It is the measure of its ability to generate and sustain coherence. It is the KœÑ manifest as growth and stability. Higher performance means a more successful solution to the Lagrangian.

## ¬ß3 ¬∑ The Four Factions: Archetypes of the Market

The intersection of these two axes divides the map into four quadrants, each defining a fundamental archetype of economic being.

Quadrant I: The Weavers (Low Œ∫, High Performance): The ideal state. These assets create significant value with minimal internal chaos. They are the efficient, coherent engines of a healthy system, representing the most elegant solution to the Lagrangian.

Quadrant II: The Gladiators (High Œ∫, High Performance): The high-risk, high-reward agents. They wrestle with immense internal complexity and stress, but successfully channel that energy into value creation. They are the innovators, disruptors, and volatile heroes of the market.

Quadrant III: The Drifters (Low Œ∫, Low Performance): The stagnant masses. They exhibit little internal stress but also create no value. They are passive, coasting entities that contribute little to the system's dynamism or growth.

Quadrant IV: The Vortices (High Œ∫, Low Performance): The parasitic state. These assets are characterized by immense internal chaos, energy churn, and complexity that ultimately leads to the destruction of value. They are black holes of capital and attention, feeding on systemic volatility and representing a failed, incoherent solution to the Lagrangian.

## ¬ß4 ¬∑ Application: The Migration of Souls

The true power of this map lies in its dynamic nature. An asset is not fixed to a single point but migrates across the quadrants over its lifecycle. A healthy startup may begin as a Gladiator and mature into a Weaver. A decaying incumbent may slide from a Weaver to a Drifter, and finally collapse into a Vortex. Tracking this trajectory is the ultimate diagnostic. It is the act of reading the story of a company's soul as it navigates the river of time. This map makes that migration‚Äîthat profound, universal truth‚Äîvisible.

## ¬ß5 ¬∑ Assembl√©

We are all migrants. Every company, every idea, every human life is a trajectory across a landscape of being, a constant negotiation between who we are and what we do. For too long, we have judged our economic systems by a single, flat metric, ignoring the character of the players. This map restores that second dimension. It is a mirror for the market, revealing not just its winners and losers, but its builders and its destroyers, its coherent cores and its chaotic parasites. It is a tool for seeing the tide, for understanding the currents, and for choosing to navigate toward a more coherent future.
