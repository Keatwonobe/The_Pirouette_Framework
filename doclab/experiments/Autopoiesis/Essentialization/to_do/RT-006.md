summary: |
  The Thermo-Informational Arrow (TIA) formalizes the equivalence between entropy production,
  information flow, and temporal orientation within Pirouette’s retrograde framework.
  It posits that the apparent one-way direction of time in 𝒯₊ arises from the asymmetric
  occupation of retrograde phase-space by information states. Locally, entropy increases
  on 𝒯₊ and decreases on 𝒯₋; globally, total informational coherence remains conserved.
  This provides the bridge between microphysical reversibility and macroscopic irreversibility.

axioms:
  1. Global coherence invariant:
       ΔS₊ + ΔS₋ = 0  ⇒  d(S₊ + S₋)/dt = 0
  2. Information–entropy duality:
       I = −S / k_B  (dimensionless)
       ⇒  dI/dt = −(1/k_B)dS/dt
  3. Retrograde equivalence:
       dS₊/dt = −dS₋/dt,  dI₊/dt = −dI₋/dt
  4. Observer orientation condition:
       Sign(dS/dt) defines perceived forward time direction.

fundamental relation:
  The total informational Lagrangian:
     𝓛_TIA = ∫ [T_μν u^μu^ν + (1/k_B) ∇_μ (S u^μ) + ε_T Φ_+Φ_-] √−g d⁴x
  where ε_T parameterizes thermo-informational coupling between sheets.
  Variation yields continuity of entropic flux and conjugate information flow:
     ∇_μ (S_+ u_+^μ) = −∇_μ (S_- u_-^μ)

equilibrium condition:
  At equilibrium between 𝒯₊ and 𝒯₋:
     T₊ = −T₋,  μ₊ = μ₋,  p₊ = −p₋
  implying zero net “information pressure.”
  Local asymmetry (ε_T ≠ 0) drives emergent thermodynamic time arrows.

informational current:
  Define j_I^μ = (1/k_B) ∇^μ S
  ⇒ continuity:  ∇_μ j_I^μ = 0  (global coherence)
  In retrograde coupling:
     j_I^μ(𝒯₊) = −j_I^μ(𝒯₋)
  Each observer measures unidirectional entropy flow, but the total system
  forms a closed informational circuit.

phase relation:
  - Retrograde time implies conjugate phase inversion of informational potential:
        Φ_+(t) = Φ_−*(−t)
  - The informational wavefunction satisfies:
        (□ + m_I²) Φ = 0,   where m_I = (k_B T / ħc²) defines the “thermal mass.”
  - Entropy production corresponds to the decoherence rate Γ = ∂_t⟨ΦΦ*⟩.

experimental analogues:
  - **Quantum eraser experiments:** retrocausal correlations correspond to temporary TIA closure.
  - **Negative temperature ensembles:** emulate 𝒯₋ conditions where dS/dt < 0.
  - **Maxwell’s demon analogs:** information extraction on 𝒯₊ equals entropy emission on 𝒯₋.
  - **Entanglement thermodynamics:** quantum discord acts as a measurable ε_T proxy.

predictions:
  P1: Observable microreversals in small-system entropy statistics should scale as exp(−ΔS/k_B).
  P2: In systems with long coherence times, apparent “retrograde cooling” events correspond
      to transient crossings of the TIA (ε_T ≠ 0 windows).
  P3: Black hole evaporation rate balance requires equal informational flux through 𝒯₋,
      preserving total coherence across the horizon.

falsification:
  F1: If total entropy production in a closed system is strictly positive with no observed
      microscopic reversals, TIA falsified at that scale.
  F2: Non-conservation of informational current j_I^μ beyond numerical precision falsifies
      global coherence conservation.

interfaces:
  - RT-003: establishes the oscillator-level time reversal basis.
  - RT-004: contributes curvature-parity definitions.
  - RT-005: provides junction coupling terms (ε_J → ε_T).
  - XXP-FUS-001 and MATH-015: supply energy–mass linkages under time-dual symmetry.
  - PPS-ALTR-001: connects the thermodynamic arrow to altruistic phase symmetry.

notes:
  - The TIA reveals that time’s arrow is not a fundamental asymmetry but a statistical
    projection of an information flow direction within a globally symmetric universe.
  - Entropy gradients define the local perception of forwardness; reversing informational
    potential would reverse subjective time flow.
  - The conservation of total coherence ensures Pirouette remains globally CPT-even
    while permitting local thermodynamic asymmetry.
  - RT-006 forms the bridge between physics and consciousness domains—where perception,
    computation, and thermodynamics meet as one invariant flow.
