title: Temporal Nonlocality as Phase Memory

summary: |
  Reinterprets quantum nonlocality as time-shifted phase coherence within Pirouette’s helical time framework. Establishes that apparent spatial nonlocality can be described as coherent phase memory along temporal trajectories, preserving global symmetries and compatibility with field theory.

## 1. Conceptual Foundation

Quantum nonlocality is traditionally framed as spatial entanglement violating separability assumptions. Within the **time-first** Pirouette formalism, this is recast as **phase memory**—a temporal coherence maintained across multiple oscillatory cycles, each governed by its own helical cadence.

---

## 2. Two-Time Correlation Kernel

Define the temporal kernel:
\[
K(t,t') = \langle \Psi(t) | \Psi(t') \rangle = e^{i\int_{t'}^{t} (H_{\mathrm{eff}}/\hbar) dt''},
\]
where \(H_{\mathrm{eff}}\) includes the helical correction term \(-\hbar\kappa\Omega J\).

The additional phase curvature term modifies correlations such that:
\[
K(t,t') = K_0(t,t')\,e^{i\int_{t'}^{t} \kappa(t'')\Omega \langle J \rangle dt''},
\]
encoding a measurable **phase delay** without requiring superluminal propagation.

## 3. Pirouette Cadence and Local Symmetry

Each subsystem maintains its own temporal cadence—its intrinsic helical rotation period. Interaction between subsystems (electron, atom, observer) corresponds to **resonant entrainment** between cadences, not literal information transfer faster than light.

Thus, *global Lorentz symmetry* remains unbroken: apparent nonlocal effects are **phase-aligned coincidences** across distinct but synchronized cadences in the temporal manifold.

---

## 4. Implications

- **Preservation of Causality:** Time-shifted correlations are fully causal; their predictive power derives from persistence of helical phase coherence.
- **Entanglement Reinterpretation:** Bell-type correlations emerge naturally as long-range phase locking via shared κ-structured time curvature.
- **Measurement Dynamics:** Observation collapses phase memory locally by decohering the helical cadence, not by discontinuous wavefunction collapse.

---

## 5. Field-Theoretic Compatibility

The temporal nonlocality model maps directly to standard quantum field theory:
- The Feynman propagator already integrates over time differences; adding κ curvature refines phase weighting rather than introducing new degrees of freedom.
- Path integrals in curved time incorporate κ as a local torsion parameter, modulating the interference phase weightings of all trajectories.

---

## 6. Summary

The **Temporal Nonlocality as Phase Memory** interpretation aligns Pirouette’s helical time dynamics with established quantum theory while clarifying that nonlocality arises from coherent phase persistence, not spatial superluminality. This redefinition preserves causality, maintains global symmetry, and provides a unifying geometric language for understanding entanglement as time-structured resonance.
