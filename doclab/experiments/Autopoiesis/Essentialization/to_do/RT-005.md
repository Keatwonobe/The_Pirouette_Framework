summary: |
  Describes the physical and mathematical behavior of junctions connecting the forward (𝒯₊)
  and retrograde (𝒯₋) time sheets. These junctions appear as surfaces where extrinsic curvature
  reverses sign and fluxes invert. In Pirouette’s framework, such boundaries correspond to
  "resonant membranes" mediating partial information exchange between time directions.
  RT-005 establishes the governing equations, analog implementations, and measurable signatures
  of retrograde junctions.

geometry:
  junction_surface: Σ(x^i, t) separating manifolds M₊ and M₋
  continuity_conditions:
    - Metric continuity: [g_ij] = 0
    - Extrinsic curvature flip: [K_ij] = 2K_ij₊ = −2K_ij₋
  stress_tensor_relation (Israel formalism):
    [K_ij − K g_ij] = 8πG S_ij ⇒  S_ij(𝒯₋) = −S_ij(𝒯₊)
  conservation:
    ∇_μ T^{μν}_Σ = 0  across Σ ⇒ dual fluxes equal and opposite.

retrograde_energy_balance:
  - Define surface energy densities σ₊, σ₋ with σ₋ = −σ₊.
  - Net balance: Δσ = σ₊ + σ₋ = 0  (global coherence conserved)
  - Observers on 𝒯₊ experience apparent negative-energy density if Σ allows partial flux leakage ε_J.

effective_action:
  S_J = ∫_Σ √−h [λ (n_μu^μ) + ε_J Φ_+Φ_- + α K_ijK^ij] d³x
  where:
    - λ is a Lagrange multiplier enforcing time-normal continuity,
    - ε_J controls cross-sheet coupling (“portal strength”),
    - α regulates membrane rigidity.

portal_field_dynamics:
  Φ_± obey Klein-Gordon–like equations on each sheet with coupling term:
    □Φ_+ + m²Φ_+ = ε_J Φ_−
    □Φ_− + m²Φ_− = ε_J Φ_+
  ⇒  normal modes: Φ_s, Φ_a with ω² = m² ± ε_J
  giving measurable frequency splittings Δω ≈ ε_J / ω.

experimental_analogues:
  - **Acoustic time mirrors:** media with tunable refractive index switching (Δn/n ≈ ε_J)
    exhibit advanced echoes—retrograde junction analog.
  - **Optical cavities:** phase-conjugate mirrors simulate Σ boundaries where K_ij ↔ −K_ij.
  - **Superconducting circuits:** Josephson junction arrays with phase reversal mimic
    retrograde energy flow, measurable via negative group delay or advanced-phase current.
  - **Fluid analog gravity:** horizon pairs (dumb holes and white holes) function as
    𝒯₊/𝒯₋ interfaces with entangled Hawking phonon pairs.

predictions:
  P1: **Phase splitting in coupled resonators:** Δω/ω ≈ ε_J predicts symmetric frequency
      doublets observable in superconducting or optical setups.
  P2: **Echo delay reversal:** in time-reversed scattering experiments, group delay sign flips
      proportionally to ε_J.
  P3: **Negative energy correlations:** cross-sheet vacuum fluctuations yield anticorrelated
      shot noise detectable in twin-photon setups.
  P4: **Thermal duality:** effective temperature of the junction T_eff obeys
      T_+ = −T_−, with global entropy conservation dS_+ + dS_− = 0.

simulation_guidelines:
  - Implement finite-element or harmonic-oscillator pairs coupled via ε_J.
  - Map phase evolution φ₊(t), φ₋(t) and verify φ₋(t) = −φ₊(−t).
  - Extract frequency splitting and phase-lag data to fit ε_J.

falsification:
  F1: Absence of frequency splitting within instrumental precision δ(Δω)
      ⇒ ε_J < ω δ(Δω)/ω.
  F2: No measurable echo delay reversal in dynamic refraction experiments
      ⇒ bounds ε_J < 10⁻⁵ for optical frequencies.
  F3: Violation of dS_+ + dS_− = 0 in analog systems falsifies thermodynamic symmetry
      across the junction.

notes:
  - Junctions act as *time-phase converters*, not simple reflections; they partially
    exchange causal directionality while conserving overall coherence.
  - ε_J parallels ε_U1 and ε_GR but operates at mesoscopic scales.
  - Observable systems like phase-conjugate optics or Josephson echo circuits offer
    the first testable window into 𝒯₊/𝒯₋ coupling.
  - RT-005 completes the physical scaffold linking field-level retrograde behavior
    to measurable laboratory phenomena.
