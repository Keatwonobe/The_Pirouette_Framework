summary: |
  Demonstrates that the quantum harmonic oscillator remains spectrally stable under time-first helical dynamics, predicting minute, chirality-dependent corrections to its energy levels. Establishes experimental parameters where these effects could be detected.

## 1. Setup

The unperturbed Hamiltonian is:
\[
H_0 = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2.
\]
Applying the helical derivative formalism (DOMA-210) yields the effective Hamiltonian:
\[
H_{\mathrm{eff}} = H_0 - \hbar\,\kappa(t)\,\Omega\,a^\dagger a,
\]
where \(a, a^\dagger\) are the standard ladder operators and \(J = a^\dagger a\) generates phase rotations.

## 2. Energy Correction

For weak, stationary \(\kappa\), the quasi-energies become:
\[
E_n \approx \hbar\omega\Big(n + \frac{1}{2}\Big) - \hbar\Omega\langle \kappa \rangle n + O(\kappa^2).
\]

### Observations
- When \(\langle \kappa \rangle = 0\), the standard quantum harmonic oscillator spectrum is exactly recovered.
- When \(\langle \kappa \rangle \neq 0\), a small **linear frequency shift** proportional to mode number \(n\) appears.

---

## 3. Physical Interpretation

The helicity term acts as a chiral gauge correction:
- In **flat κ-space** (ordinary media), \(\langle\kappa\rangle = 0\), so all observable effects vanish.
- In **curved κ-space** (chiral or magnetized media), \(\langle\kappa\rangle \neq 0\), introducing measurable line-shape asymmetry.

This formulation preserves global symmetries while embedding the local time curvature induced by helicity.

## 4. Experimental Signatures

1. **Spectroscopic asymmetry:** Detectable as minute red/blue shifts in helical photonic crystals or chiral plasmas.
2. **Phase-locked squeezing:** Periodic modulation of \(\kappa(t)\) at twice the oscillator frequency produces phase-sensitive squeezing, consistent with the Resonant Uncertainty Principle.
3. **Null region confirmation:** Achiral control systems should show no deviations from \(E_n = \hbar\omega(n+\tfrac{1}{2})\).

## 5. Implications for Time-First Quantum Field Theory

The oscillator’s invariance under time-curved dynamics validates that **standard quantum mechanics** is the κ→0 limit of the helical calculus. This result demonstrates:
- Compatibility with established energy quantization.
- Predictive power for subtle, chirality-induced spectral features.
- Pathway to extend the time-first formalism to multi-mode and field-theoretic systems.

## 6. Summary

The **Quantum Oscillator in Curved Time** module confirms that Pirouette’s helical time dynamics preserve canonical quantum behavior while enriching it with measurable chiral curvature terms. It bridges theoretical and experimental physics by identifying where κ-induced modulations may become observable, thus providing a key test for the Pirouette calculus.
