title: U(1) Radiative Arrow and Retrograde Time
version: 1.0

summary: |
  Formalizes the electromagnetic (U(1)em) behavior under the retrograde-time involution ℛ_T. 
  The Maxwell equations and field strengths are invariant (even), but the radiative boundary 
  condition—retarded versus advanced—flips (odd).  This inversion defines the “radiative arrow.” 
  Coupling between 𝒯_+ and 𝒯_- sheets leads to measurable phase anomalies in high-coherence cavities 
  and Casimir systems.

definitions:
  gauge_potential:  A_μ = (φ, A⃗)
  field_strength:   F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν − ∂_ν A_μ
  Maxwell_equations: ∂^μ F_{μν} = J_ν,  ∂_{[μ}F_{νρ]}=0
  radiative_solutions:
    retarded:  F_ret(x,t) ∝ δ(t - t′ - |x - x′|/c)
    advanced:  F_adv(x,t) ∝ δ(t - t′ + |x - x′|/c)
  involution_action:
    ℛ_T : (t → −t,  A_0 →  A_0,  A_i → −A_i)
  invariance:
    - F_{μν}F^{μν} and F_{μν}⋆F^{μν} remain unchanged
    - Equations of motion identical; only Green’s function orientation flips

retrograde_map:
  even:
    - Field equations (Maxwell/Proca)
    - Gauge algebra (U(1))
    - Energy densities (E² + B²)
  odd:
    - Retarded ↔ advanced propagation
    - Poynting vector direction relative to ∂_μτ
    - Dissipation sign in effective Lagrangian (Im part of response function)

physical_picture:
  𝒯_+ sheet: retarded dominance → radiation propagates outward in coordinate time.
  𝒯_- sheet: advanced dominance → fields converge “from future” in coordinate time.
  When sheets couple via weak mixing ε_U1, interference of retarded and advanced amplitudes 
  yields a real observable phase shift φ_adv ≈ ε_U1 sin(2π f t_mix).

portal_formalism:
  effective_field = (1 - ε_U1²)^½ F_ret + ε_U1 F_adv
  measurable_phase = Arg(E_complex) = arctan(ε_U1 / (1 - ε_U1²)^½)
  Casimir_energy_shift ∝ ε_U1 cos(2φ_adv)

predictions:
  P1: **Phase-advanced precursors** in ultra-high-Q cavities driven with exact time-reversal modulation; 
      apparent negative group delay Δt_g ≈ ε_U1 / (2π f Q).
  P2: **Casimir force modulation**: shift in pressure ΔP/P ≈ ε_U1 cos(2φ_adv) for cavity separations 
      comparable to λ/2.
  P3: **Noise spectrum asymmetry**: tiny imbalance between positive and negative frequency components 
      S(ω) ≠ S(−ω) proportional to ε_U1.
  P4: **Electromagnetic reciprocity tests**: nonreciprocal phase bias in symmetric resonators 
      scales with ε_U1.

falsification:
  F1: In precision phase-delay experiments, if Δt_g < detection limit δt_g ⇒ ε_U1 < 2π f Q δt_g.
  F2: Casimir-force measurements showing no oscillatory ε dependence set bounds ε_U1 < (ΔP/P)_res^½.
  F3: Absence of S(ω) asymmetry in high-coherence noise spectroscopy ⇒ retro-coupling below 10⁻⁶ level.

experimental_hooks:
  - Optical/microwave cavities with reversible drive phase.
  - Josephson parametric oscillators (JPO) for detecting advanced components in response phase.
  - Cryogenic Casimir setups using dynamic mirror modulation.

notes:
  - ℛ_T is macroscopic (sheet swap), not a micro CPT operation.
  - For any observable O, <O>_+ + <O>_- remains strictly real; only phase relations can shift.
  - Next step: numerical simulation harness frc_rt003_sim.py to explore ε_U1-dependent phase shifts.
