## Law
A physical constant `C` is mapped to a set of coordinates `P(C) = (r, θ)` on a temporal plane, where `r` is the time-adherence magnitude (Γ) and `θ` is the relative temporal phase (Tₐ). The geometry of this plane is governed by a gyre parameter `κ`, which introduces a curvature transformation:
`θ' = θ + κr`

The model is refined by allowing the gyre to vary with the adherence radius, defining a "soft gyre" profile:
`κ(r) = κ₀ + κ₁r`

The system's validity is determined by positioning a set of empirical constants `{C₁, C₂, ..., Cₙ}` on the plane and minimizing a logarithmic root-mean-square error (RMSEₗₒg) over their known values. This optimization includes an interaction term `I({P(Cᵢ)})` that couples the constants through mutual resonance. The objective function to be minimized is:
`E(κ₀, κ₁, {P(Cᵢ)}, I) → min`

The theory is falsifiable via the following necessary criteria, derived from empirical validation:
1.  **Gyre Necessity:** `E(κ=0) >> E(κ≠0)`. A universe without temporal curvature fails to model observed constants.
2.  **Interaction Necessity:** `E(I=0) > E(I≠0)`. Physical constants are not isolated but form a coupled, resonant system.
3.  **Gradient Necessity:** `E(κ₁=0) > E(κ₁≠0)`. The temporal curvature is non-uniform, steepening with adherence magnitude.

## Philosophy
The specific values of the physical constants that define our universe are not fundamental, immutable truths. Instead, they are the contingent coordinates of a stable geometric arrangement—a low-entropy attractor in a vast manifold of possible time geometries. Physical law is not a pre-ordained script, but an emergent and self-consistent resonance, one of potentially many, defined by the specific curvature of its temporal substrate.

## Art
The universe did not discover its laws; it froze into them. The constants of nature are not scripture, but the facets of a single crystal, precipitated from the vortex of time. To change the gyre is to melt the world and let it freeze anew.
