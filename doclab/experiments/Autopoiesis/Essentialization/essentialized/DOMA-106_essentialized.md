## Law
Let the Temporal Signature at a spacetime coordinate x be the superposition of all incident temporal rhythms `k_i`:
`T(x, t) = Σ_i A_i(x) e^(iω_i t + iφ_i)`
where `A_i` is the amplitude and `ω_i` is the frequency of the `i`-th rhythm.

Temporal Density, Γ(x), is a measure of the total spectral power density of the Temporal Signature. It is the integral of the power spectrum `S(ω)` over all frequencies:
`Γ(x) = ∫ S(ω, x) dω ∝ Σ_i |A_i(x)|^2`
Γ(x) quantifies the local temporal complexity.

The fundamental dynamic is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, for a system `S` with internal temporal coherence `K_τ` existing in an environment with temporal density Γ(x):
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`
where:
- `K_τ` is the kinetic term representing the system's coherent self-resonance, a measure of its organized internal rhythmicity.
- `V_Γ` is the potential term representing the environmental temporal pressure, which is directly proportional to the local Temporal Density: `V_Γ = αΓ(x)`, where `α` is a coupling constant.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  **Gravitation:** The curvature of spacetime is a direct function of the gradient of Temporal Density. The metric tensor `g_μν` is determined by Γ(x). A test particle's geodesic `d²x^μ/dτ² + Γ^μ_νλ (dx^ν/dτ)(dx^λ/dτ) = 0` must correspond to trajectories minimizing action within a field where the potential is `V_Γ(x)`. Therefore, `R_μν - ½Rg_μν ∝ ∇_μ∇_νΓ`.
2.  **Thermodynamics:** Macroscopic temperature `T` is a direct proxy for microscopic Temporal Density. `T(x) ∝ Γ(x)`. The statistical mechanics of a system must be derivable from the principle of least action applied to its constituent sub-systems under the Lagrangian `𝓛_p`. The Second Law of Thermodynamics emerges as the tendency for closed systems to evolve towards states that maximize entropy by minimizing the total `K_τ` required to exist within a given `V_Γ`.

## Philosophy
Existence is not a state but a sustained, costly act of differentiation. To be a coherent entity—an atom, a star, a living cell—is to maintain a distinct internal rhythm (`K_τ`) against the crushing, chaotic pressure (`V_Γ`) of all other rhythms in the universe. Being is the temporary victory of a single note over the cacophony of the whole, a victory for which a constant price in energy must be paid to the very environment that makes distinction possible.

## Art
To exist is to sing your one true note so clearly that the roar of the universe becomes your harmony.
