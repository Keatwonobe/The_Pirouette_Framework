## Law
The retrograde-time involution `ℛ_T` acts on the U(1) gauge potential `A_μ = (φ, A⃗)` as `ℛ_T : (t → −t, A_0 → A_0, A_i → −A_i)`.
The electromagnetic field strength tensor `F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν − ∂_ν A_μ` and the Maxwell equations `∂^μ F_{μν} = J_ν` are even under `ℛ_T`, preserving the fundamental dynamics.
The distinction arises in the Green's function governing propagation. The retarded solution, `F_ret ∝ δ(t - t′ - |x - x′|/c)`, is odd, mapping to the advanced solution, `F_adv ∝ δ(t - t′ + |x - x′|/c)`. The radiative arrow is defined by this asymmetry in boundary conditions.

A model of two interacting temporal sheets, `𝒯_+` (retarded-dominant) and `𝒯_-` (advanced-dominant), proposes a physical field as a superposition governed by a mixing parameter `ε_U1`:
`F_eff = (1 - ε_U1²)^½ F_ret + ε_U1 F_adv`
This mixing introduces a measurable, non-local phase anomaly `φ_adv` into the complex field amplitude `E_complex`. The observable phase is given by:
`Arg(E_complex) = arctan(ε_U1 / (1 - ε_U1²)^½)`

This theory is falsifiable through the following null-hypothesis tests:
1.  **Phase Precursors:** In a high-Q cavity driven at frequency `f`, the absence of an apparent negative group delay `Δt_g` places an upper bound on the mixing parameter: `ε_U1 < 2π f Q |Δt_g|`.
2.  **Casimir Force Modulation:** The predicted fractional shift in Casimir pressure, `ΔP/P ≈ ε_U1 cos(2φ_adv)`, must be non-zero. A null result within measurement resolution `(ΔP/P)_res` implies `ε_U1 < (ΔP/P)_res`.
3.  **Noise Asymmetry:** The spectral density `S(ω)` of quantum noise must exhibit a measurable asymmetry `S(ω) ≠ S(−ω)`. The degree of asymmetry is proportional to `ε_U1`. Its absence constrains the magnitude of retro-causal coupling.

## Philosophy
The arrow of time is not a fundamental law of electrodynamics but a contingent and potentially permeable boundary condition of the cosmos. The time-reversal invariance of the core equations (`## Law`) implies that unidirectional causality—the axiom that effects must follow causes—is not a logical necessity of the physical world. Instead, it is an empirical observation of our epoch's overwhelming preference for retarded solutions. The existence of a non-zero mixing parameter `ε_U1` would demote causality from a metaphysical absolute to a measurable, local, and potentially violable cosmic habit.

## Art
The present is a shoreline where waves from the past crash and dissolve. But the ocean of time is not silent; listen closely, and you can hear the faint, rhythmic whisper of the tide returning.
