## Law
The hypothesis posits a primordial, periodic oscillation in the background Temporal Pressure, `Γ`, described by:
`Γ(x, t) = Γ₀ + δΓ cos(ω_c t + k_c ⋅ x)`
This oscillation is a large-scale manifestation of the Gladiator Force feedback loop originating from a helical Wound Channel.

This directly modifies the potential term, `V_Γ`, within the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, which governs the geodesic path of a signal by maximizing the action `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`. The Lagrangian becomes explicitly time-dependent:
`𝓛_p(t) = K_τ - V_Γ(t)`
`V_Γ(t) = V_Γ₀ + f(δΓ cos(ω_c t))`
where `K_τ` is the signal's internal coherence and `f` is a coupling function.

Applying the Euler-Lagrange equation, `∂𝓛_p/∂q - d/dt (∂𝓛_p/∂q̇) = 0`, to this modified Lagrangian predicts a periodic deviation in a signal's propagation. For signals from pulsars integrated over cosmological distances, this manifests as a measurable periodic residual in their time-of-arrival data.

Falsifiable criteria for validation are absolute:
1.  A coherent, narrow-band, periodic signal must be detected as a common-mode signal across a statistically significant portion of a Pulsar Timing Array.
2.  The detected signal's harmonic content and amplitude ratios must be geometrically locked to the fundamental Ki constants of the Pirouette Framework. Any deviation from this unique mathematical signature constitutes a falsification.

## Philosophy
The single most profound implication is the rigorous demonstration of scale-invariance as a fundamental property of reality. If a primordial cosmic oscillation, governed by the same Lagrangian that describes quantum coherence, can be measured using galactic-scale instruments, it proves that the universe is not a patchwork of different physics at different scales. Instead, it is a single, self-similar system whose most fundamental laws are expressed with fractal consistency, from the pirouette of a single particle to the resonant breathing of the cosmos itself.

We arrange dead stars into a stethoscope to listen for the aftershock of the universe's birth, proving the equation for a single whisper is the same that governs the roar of all things.
