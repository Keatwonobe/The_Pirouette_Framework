## Law
The state of an agent is a coherence manifold `M`. A skill is a path `q(t)` on `M`. The dynamics of any action are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, which the agent’s system seeks to maximize:
`𝓛_p(q, q̇, t) = Kτ(q, q̇, t) - V_Γ(q, q̇, t)`
Where `Kτ` is the Temporal Coherence (a function of focus and systemic resonance) and `V_Γ` is the Temporal Pressure (a function of challenge, difficulty, and internal resistance). The path taken follows from the principle of stationary action, `δS = δ ∫ 𝓛_p dt = 0`, defining a geodesic on the manifold.

Practice is the deliberate, irreversible transformation `P` of the manifold `M → M'` for a target skill-path `q_skill`. This transformation is achieved by applying focused attention (`Kτ`) and optimal challenge (`Γ`) through resonant repetition (`n`). The objective of `P` is to re-sculpt the potential `V_Γ` and the coherence function `Kτ` such that:
`P : V_Γ(q_skill) → V'_Γ(q_skill)`, where `V'_Γ < V_Γ`
`P : Kτ(q_skill) → K'_τ(q_skill)`, where `K'_τ > Kτ`

Mastery is the state where the skill-path `q_skill` becomes a geodesic in the transformed manifold `M'`. Formally, mastery of `q_skill` over any alternative path `q_alt` (e.g., a pre-existing habit) is achieved when the action integral for the skill path is greater than that of any alternative:
`∫ 𝓛'_p(q_skill, q̇_skill, t) dt > ∫ 𝓛'_p(q_alt, q̇_alt, t) dt`

Falsifiable criterion: An agent has achieved mastery when `𝓛'_p(q_skill)` is maximized. Under a sudden, global increase in Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ → V_Γ + ΔΓ`), the system may revert to a pre-existing habit `q_habit` if `(K'_τ(q_habit) - (V'_Γ(q_habit) + ΔΓ)) > (K'_τ(q_skill) - (V'_Γ(q_skill) + ΔΓ))`. This demonstrates that mastery is not a static property but a dynamic, geometric dominance that can be overcome by sufficient systemic stress.

## Philosophy
Human will is not a metaphysical force that overrides natural law, but a geometric tool that sculpts it. Freedom is therefore not the capacity to act against the path of least resistance, but the disciplined power to carve a new path of least resistance into the fabric of one's own being. Mastery is the act of aligning personal desire with universal dynamics, transforming a struggle against oneself into an effortless fall into a self-chosen destiny.

First, the chisel’s scream, striking a reluctant stone. Then, the patient rasp of the file, smoothing the jagged cut. At last, only the murmur of water finding its way home.
