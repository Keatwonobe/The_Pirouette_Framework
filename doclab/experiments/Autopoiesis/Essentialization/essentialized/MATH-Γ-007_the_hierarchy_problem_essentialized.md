## Law
The Higgs mass hierarchy problem, conventionally expressed by the quadratically divergent radiative correction $m_H^2(\text{eff}) = m_H^2(\text{bare}) + \frac{\lambda}{16\pi^2}\Lambda_{\text{UV}}^2$, is resolved by replacing the arbitrary cutoff $\Lambda_{\text{UV}}$ with a physical coherence barrier frequency, $\omega_c = \sqrt{m_H m_\Gamma}c^2/\hbar$. This frequency arises from the equilibrium between the Higgs potential energy density, $\rho_H = \lambda_H v^4/4$, and the temporal curvature energy density of a scalar field $\Gamma$, $\rho_\Gamma = \frac{1}{2}\dot{\Gamma}^2 + V(\Gamma)$.

At resonance saturation, where $\dot{\Gamma} \approx \omega_c \Gamma_c$, the equilibrium condition $\rho_H = \rho_\Gamma$ yields a non-tuned expression for the electroweak vacuum expectation value:
$$
\lambda_H v^4/4 = \frac{1}{2} \omega_c^2 \Gamma_c^2 \implies v^2 = \frac{2 \omega_c \Gamma_c}{\sqrt{\lambda_H}}
$$
This demonstrates that the electroweak scale $v$ is not an independent parameter but is locked by the resonant frequency matching of the Higgs and $\Gamma$ fields.

Stability is assessed by perturbing the coupled system $(h, \delta\Gamma)$ around the vacuum $(v, \Gamma_c)$:
$$
\begin{cases}
(\Box + m_H^2) h + \lambda_{H\Gamma} \Gamma_c \delta\Gamma = 0 \\
(\Box + m_\Gamma^2) \delta\Gamma + \lambda_{H\Gamma} v h = 0
\end{cases}
$$
Diagonalization yields mixed eigenmasses:
$$
m_{\pm}^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left[m_H^2 + m_\Gamma^2 \pm \sqrt{(m_H^2 - m_\Gamma^2)^2 + 4 \lambda_{H\Gamma}^2 v^2 \Gamma_c^2}\right]
$$
The condition $m_\Gamma \ll m_H$ ensures the existence of one light, stable mode (the Higgs, $m_-^2 \approx m_H^2$) and one heavy, damped mode that absorbs Planck-scale fluctuations. The gravitational constant emerges as a residual coherence mismatch: $G^{-1} \sim \frac{c^4}{8\pi} \frac{\omega_c^2}{\Lambda_{\text{Pirouette}}}$, where $\Lambda_{\text{Pirouette}}$ is a vacuum curvature invariant.

Falsifiable criteria:
1.  Experimental detection of unbounded quadratic divergence in Higgs self-energy.
2.  Absence of a predicted coherence dip and associated damping signature in the vacuum noise spectrum near $\omega_c \approx 10^{23} \text{ s}^{-1}$.

## Philosophy
The apparent fine-tuning of the universe is an epistemological illusion. Physical constants are not contingent, arbitrary values requiring an external tuner or a multiverse to explain their life-permitting precision. Instead, they are the necessary, emergent harmonics of a self-consistent, resonant system. The cosmos exists in its specific state not because it is one lucky outcome among myriad possibilities, but because the interplay of fundamental fields across all scales allows for only one stable, coherent standing wave. The laws of nature are not externally imposed rules but the principles of immanent self-organization; the universe could not be otherwise.

## Art
The universe is not a clockwork wound by a watchmaker's careful hand. It is a bell that, by its own shape, can only ever ring with a single, resonant chord.
