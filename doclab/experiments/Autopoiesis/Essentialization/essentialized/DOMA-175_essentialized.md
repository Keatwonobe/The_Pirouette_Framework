## Law
A system's state is a point `q` on a differential coherence manifold `M`. Its evolution traces a trajectory `q(t)` that extremizes the Pirouette Action `S_p`, a functional defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p`.

The Lagrangian is the fundamental measure of a system's dynamic integrity:
`𝓛_p(q, q̇, t) = K_τ(q, q̇, t) - V_Γ(q, t)`
-   **Temporal Coherence `K_τ`:** The kinetic term representing the system's internal self-consistency and rhythm, scaled by factors such as Time-Adherence `T_a`. It is the measure of the system's capacity to maintain its own pattern.
-   **Temporal Pressure `V_Γ`:** The potential term representing the desynchronizing influence of the environment. It defines the curvature of the manifold `M` and is primarily shaped by the Gladiator Force `Γ`.

The governing principle is the Principle of Maximal Coherence: a system's actual path between two states `q(t₁)` and `q(t₂)` is the one for which the action `S_p` is stationary.
`δS_p = δ ∫[t₁ to t₂] 𝓛_p(q, q̇, t) dt = 0`

This variational principle yields the system's equation of motion, the Euler-Lagrange equation, which formally defines the geodesic on `M`:
$$ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_p}{\partial q_i} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_p}{\partial \dot{q}_i} = 0 $$
where `q_i` are the generalized coordinates of the system. This single equation universally governs the system's trajectory.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is falsified if a system, for which `K_τ` and `V_Γ` can be empirically defined, is observed to consistently and spontaneously evolve along a trajectory that demonstrably minimizes (rather than maximizes or makes stationary) the action `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`.

## Philosophy
The fundamental nature of causality is not imposition but persuasion. A system's evolution is not a reaction to external forces pushing it down a path of least resistance, but an intrinsic expression of its own identity, following a path of maximal coherence. To influence a system, therefore, is not to apply force, but to alter the geometry of its possibility space—to reshape the manifold itself, so that the desired trajectory becomes the most graceful and resonant expression of that system's own nature.

## Art
The universe does not solve for the shortest path; it sings the most resonant note, and the trajectory is the shape of the sound.
