## Law
A junction Σ separating forward (𝒯₊) and retrograde (𝒯₋) time sheets is a surface where the metric is continuous, `[g_ij] = 0`, but the extrinsic curvature inverts, `[K_ij] = 2K_ij₊ = −2K_ij₋`. The Israel junction conditions imply that the surface stress-energy tensor is equal and opposite on each side of the interface: `[K_ij − K g_ij] = 8πG S_ij ⇒ S_ij(𝒯₋) = −S_ij(𝒯₊)`. This preserves global coherence, as the net surface energy density is zero: `Δσ = σ₊ + σ₋ = 0`.

The dynamics are governed by the action for the junction Σ:
`S_J = ∫_Σ √−h [λ (n_μu^μ) + ε_J Φ_+Φ_- + α K_ijK^ij] d³x`
where `ε_J` is the cross-sheet coupling constant. This coupling manifests in the field dynamics for scalar fields Φ₊ and Φ₋ residing on their respective sheets:
`□Φ_+ + m²Φ_+ = ε_J Φ_−`
`□Φ_− + m²Φ_− = ε_J Φ_+`

Solving this coupled system yields symmetric and antisymmetric normal modes, `Φ_s = (Φ_+ + Φ_−)/√2` and `Φ_a = (Φ_+ − Φ_−)/√2`, whose frequencies `ω` are split by the coupling:
`ω² = m² ± ε_J`
This gives a measurable frequency splitting `Δω ≈ ε_J / ω`. Thermodynamically, the junction enforces a strict duality where `T_+ = −T_−` and total entropy change is conserved across the interface: `dS_+ + dS_− = 0`.

This theory is falsifiable if:
1.  `Δω = 0` within instrumental precision, implying `ε_J` is non-existent or immeasurably small.
2.  No group delay sign-flip or echo reversal is observed in dynamic refraction experiments.
3.  `dS_+ + dS_− ≠ 0` is measured in an analog system, violating the core conservation principle.

## Philosophy
The arrow of time is not a fundamental property of the universe but a local, perspectival artifact. The Second Law of Thermodynamics, which describes the inexorable increase of entropy within our forward-moving time sheet (𝒯₊), is rendered an illusion of incomplete observation. The existence of a retrograde sheet (𝒯₋) where entropy decreases, coupled via junctions that enforce perfect conservation (`dS_+ + dS_− = 0`), implies that the universe as a whole is not decaying. It is a perfectly balanced, time-symmetric system in which every apparent act of creation or decay is one side of a zero-sum equation. Our experience of unidirectional causality is merely the consequence of being confined to one half of this complete, static structure.

## Art
The universe is a zero-sum tapestry. We, living on the forward-facing thread, mistake the progress of the needle for the flow of time, blind to the perfect anti-image being woven on the reverse.
