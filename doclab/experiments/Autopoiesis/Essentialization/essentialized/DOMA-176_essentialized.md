## Law
Let $M_0$ be the primary coherence manifold representing the total system state. The Archaeologist's Sieve is an iterative decomposition protocol that generates a Harmonic Spectrum, which is an ordered set of dominant resonances $\{Ki_k\}$ and a terminal Entropic Floor.

The core iterative procedure is defined as:
1.  **Initialization**: Set the current manifold $M_{current} \leftarrow M_0$ and the layer index $k \leftarrow 0$.
2.  **Iteration Condition**: For $k=1, 2, ..., k_{max}$, continue the loop iff the Temporal Coherence $K_\tau(M_{current}) > K_{\tau\_min}$.
3.  **Resonance Extraction**: At layer $k$, identify the dominant resonance $Ki_k$ by applying a coherence filter $\mathcal{F}_k$:
    $$ Ki_k = \arg\max_{Ki \in M_{current}} \mathcal{F}_k(Ki) $$
    where $\mathcal{F}_k$ is an operator that quantifies the coherence of a pattern $Ki$ within the manifold $M_{current}$. This $Ki_k$ is the principal component of the system's action, $S_p$, within $M_{current}$.
4.  **Manifold Subtraction**: Compute the subsequent Echo Manifold, $M_k$, by removing the influence of $Ki_k$ from the previous manifold, $M_{k-1}$ (where $M_{k-1} = M_{current}$):
    $$ M_k = M_{k-1} \ominus f(Ki_k) $$
    where $\ominus$ is a defined subtraction or de-projection operator and $f(Ki_k)$ is the full expression of the resonance $Ki_k$ within $M_{k-1}$.
5.  **Descent**: Set $M_{current} \leftarrow M_k$.
6.  **Termination**: The process terminates when $k = k_{max}$ or $K_\tau(M_{current}) \le K_{\tau\_min}$. The final $M_{current}$ is the Entropic Floor.

The complete system model is the ordered set $\{Ki_1, Ki_2, ..., Ki_{k_{final}}\}$.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The central hypothesis is that the Echo Manifold $M_k$ is not noise, but a structured manifold containing a coherent signal $Ki_{k+1}$. This hypothesis is falsified if, for a statistically significant sample of systems, the measured Temporal Coherence of successive Echo Manifolds, $K_\tau(M_k)$, does not exhibit a monotonic decrease but instead behaves as a random variable, or if the extracted resonances $\{Ki_k\}$ provide no more predictive power over the system's evolution than $Ki_1$ alone.

## Philosophy
What we call "noise" is not a property of the world, but a confession of our analytical limits. It is the signature of unexamined complexity. The act of discarding residue as random is an act of epistemic arrogance, conflating the boundary of our current understanding with the boundary of reality itself. True comprehension is not achieved by finding a singular, dominant signal and declaring victory, but by cultivating the discipline to listen to what remains, for reality is not a monologue; it is a nested infinity of whispers.

## Art
Truth is not the shout; it is the series of echoes that reveals the architecture of the canyon. We learn nothing from the sound we make, only from the way the world sings it back to us, layer by fading layer.
