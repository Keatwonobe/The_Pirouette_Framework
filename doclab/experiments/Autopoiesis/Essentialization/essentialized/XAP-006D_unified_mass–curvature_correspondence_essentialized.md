## Law
The fundamental invariant $\mathfrak{M}^2$, from which all mass arises, is the sum of three geometric terms defined on a τ-manifold with metric $ds^2 = K_\Gamma\,d\tau^2 - \Lambda_\Gamma\,|d\Sigma|^2$.

1.  **Temporal Substrate Curvature**: The Ricci scalar of the temporal manifold, $\mathcal{R}_\tau$.
    \[
    \mathcal{R}_\tau = \frac{1}{K_\Gamma}\,\partial_\tau^2 \ln |K_\Gamma| - \frac{1}{\Lambda_\Gamma}\,\nabla^2 \ln |\Lambda_\Gamma|
    \]

2.  **Coherence Field Stiffness**: The rigidity of the scalar field $\Gamma$ against fluctuations around its vacuum expectation value $\Gamma_0$.
    \[
    \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 = \frac{V''(\Gamma_0)}{K_\Gamma}
    \]

3.  **Ki-Fiber Curvature**: The field strength of the internal gauge connection $A_\mu$.
    \[
    \mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu}= \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu + [A_\mu,A_\nu]
    \]

The unified mass-squared invariant, conserved under τ-isometries, is:
\[
\mathfrak{M}^2 = \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 + \frac{\mathcal{R}_\tau}{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}} + \frac{\mathrm{Tr}(\mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu}\mathcal{F}^{\mu\nu})}{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}}
\]
where $G_{\text{eff}}^{-1}=8\pi K_\Gamma$ is the emergent gravitational coupling. This law generates distinct mass terms, e.g., for fermions: $m_f = y_\Gamma\Gamma_0 + \frac{1}{4} \langle R_\tau\rangle$.

A Renormalization Group invariant locks these curvatures across energy scales $\Lambda$:
\[
\mathcal{I}_{\text{mass}} = \frac{\langle\mathrm{Tr}(F^2)\rangle_\tau}{\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2} \Lambda^{-2(c_2-c_1)} = \text{const}
\]

The primary falsifiable criterion is that rest masses exhibit a logarithmic running with energy, predictable from the $\beta$-functions of the component curvatures.

## Philosophy
The distinction between substance and space is an illusion. Matter is not an entity that *has* the property of mass and *occupies* a location in spacetime; rather, it *is* a localized, compound curvature of the temporal substrate and its associated geometric fibers. Inertia, the defining characteristic of mass, is therefore not resistance to acceleration by an external force, but the universe's internal geometric resistance to altering its own intricate shape.

## Art
To lift a stone is to attempt to smooth a crease in time itself; its weight is the memory of the fold.
