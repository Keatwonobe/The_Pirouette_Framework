## Law
The fundamental interaction couples the Pressuron field (Î“) to the axial-vector current of a constituent quark field ( q_i ) of mass ( m_i ). The interaction Lagrangian is:
[
\mathcal{L}*{\Gamma q}
= g*\Gamma \frac{m_i}{\Lambda_\Gamma^2},
\bar{q}*i \gamma*\mu \gamma_5 q_i , \partial^\mu \Gamma ,
\quad \text{where} \quad
\Lambda_\Gamma \equiv \frac{m_\Gamma}{g_\Gamma}
]
For a composite baryon (B) of mass ( M_B ), internal QCD coherence damps the net coupling, introducing a non-perturbative suppression factor ( \eta_B \ll 1 ). This yields an effective perturbative correction to the baryon's magnetic anomaly ( a_B \equiv (g_B-2)/2 ):
[
\Delta a_B = \eta_B \left( \frac{g_\Gamma^2}{8\pi^2} \right) \left( \frac{M_B}{m_\Gamma} \right)^2
]
The theory is falsified if either of two conditions is met:
1. An anomalous contribution to any baryonic magnetic moment is observed to scale other than as ( M_B^2 ).
2. A confirmed Pressuron-induced anomaly ( \Delta a_B ) is measured with a magnitude exceeding the coherence bound, specifically ( |\Delta a_B| > 10^{-9} ), for nucleons.

## Philosophy
The internal complexity and coherence of a system can act as a shield against fundamental interactions, creating an emergent simplicity. The whole becomes less, not merely different, than the sum of its parts, as the tightly-woven internal dynamics conspire to render the system nearly invisible to an aspect of the external universe.
