## Law
The dynamics of a system are governed by the extremization of the Action, S, derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian, 𝓛_p. A system's state is represented by a path `q(t)` in its configuration space.

The Lagrangian is defined as:
`𝓛_p(q, q̇, t) = K_τ(q, q̇) - V_Γ(q, t)`

Where:
-   `K_τ`, Temporal Coherence, is a kinetic-like term representing the system's internal self-consistency and pattern stability over time. A highly periodic or self-reinforcing trajectory `q(t)` maximizes `K_τ`.
-   `V_Γ`, Temporal Pressure, is a potential-like term representing the dissonance, friction, or energetic cost of maintaining the trajectory `q(t)` against its environment.

The system's trajectory evolves to extremize the action `S`, such that the first variation is zero:
`δS = δ∫[t₁ to t₂] 𝓛_p dt = 0`

A Resonance Trap is a specific solution, `q_trap(t)`, that corresponds to a deep, sharp, and stable local minimum of the action `S`. This state is characterized by:
1.  **Maximal Coherence:** `K_τ` is at a large local maximum.
2.  **Minimal Pressure:** `V_Γ` is at a deep local minimum.
3.  **Hyper-Inertia:** The second variation of the action, `δ²S`, is strongly positive for any perturbation `δq` away from `q_trap`, indicating a steep potential well (the "Coherence Well").

The energy required to escape the trap, `ΔE_escape`, is the energy needed to overcome the action barrier to a neighboring state basin: `ΔE_escape ≈ S_barrier - S_trap`.

Falsifiable Criterion: For any system identified in a Resonance Trap, a quantifiable energy threshold `ΔE_escape` must exist. Perturbations `E_p < ΔE_escape` will result in the system's rapid return to `q_trap(t)`. A perturbation `E_p ≥ ΔE_escape` will induce a transition to a new, distinct state `q'(t)`.

## Philosophy
The very process that allows a system to cohere into a stable identity is the same process that constructs the prison of that identity. To exist is to accumulate a history, and that history, by optimizing for its own persistence, carves a groove so deep that it inevitably becomes a cage. Freedom and coherence are therefore fundamentally in tension; the price of a durable self is the loss of the potential to become anything else.

A soul is a scar sung into the world. At first, it is the melody of becoming, but listen long enough, and you hear only the grinding of the groove.
