## Law
The Social Dissonance Field, $\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{x}, t)$, is defined as the non-harmonic residual flow vector $\mathbf{r}$ resulting from the difference between the observed social interaction flow $\mathbf{J}_{obs}$ and the idealized coherence flow $\mathbf{J}_{opt}$. $\mathbf{J}_{opt}$ is derived by maximizing the Pirouette action $S = \int \mathcal{L}_s dt$, where the Lagrangian is $\mathcal{L}_s = T_a,\omega_k - f(\Gamma; S_{soc})$.

The residual flow $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{J}_{obs} - \mathbf{J}_{opt}$ is decomposed via the Hodge-Helmholtz theorem on the societal graph:
$$
\mathbf{r} = \nabla\phi + \nabla \times \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{h}
$$
where $\phi$ is the irrotational (gradient) potential of cooperative deficit, $\mathbf{A}$ is the solenoidal (curl) potential of antagonistic circulation, and $\mathbf{h}$ is the harmonic residue representing persistent structural tension.

The Dissonance Field is constituted by the non-harmonic components:
$$
\mathbf{D} \equiv \nabla\phi + \nabla \times \mathbf{A}
$$

**Falsifiable Hypotheses:**

1.  **The Coherence Halo:** For a system with a defined coherence core of radius $r_c$ (where $|\nabla|\mathbf{D}||$ is maximal), the magnitude of the dissonance field decays as a power law:
    $$
    |\mathbf{D}| \sim r^{-1} \quad \text{for } r > r_c
    $$
2.  **The Cascade Threshold:** Systemic cascade events are preceded by the circulation of the dissonance field exceeding a substrate-dependent, but otherwise invariant, threshold $\Theta$:
    $$
    \oint_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{D}\cdot d\mathbf{l} > \Theta
    $$
**Falsification Criteria:** The theory is falsified if: (a) $|\mathbf{D}|$ does not exhibit stable power-law decay across multiple systems, or (b) the cascade threshold $\Theta$ is not invariant for societies with similar substrate mappings $f(\Gamma; S_{soc})$.

## Philosophy
Human conflict, inequality, and polarization are not primarily products of flawed ideology or individual morality. They are objective, geometric properties that emerge from the structure of interaction networks. Social health is a conserved quantity, analogous to energy or momentum, and dysfunction is a measurable field distortion—a curvature in the social manifold itself. Morality, then, becomes a branch of engineering: the science of modifying a system's topology to minimize dissonance and restore coherent flow.

## Art
A society is not a collection of people; it is a current of exchange. Justice is the shape of its channel. Injustice is not the dam that stops the flow, but the eddy that forms in its shadow—a vortex of motion without progress, forever turning on itself, carving a wound where a river should be.
