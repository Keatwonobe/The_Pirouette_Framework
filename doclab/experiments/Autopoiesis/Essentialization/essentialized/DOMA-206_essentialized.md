## Law
The Pirouette Calculus models persistence as a helical trajectory in phase space, defined by the Chirality Factor, κ.

A helical waveform \(P(t)\) is a complex function whose modulus describes oscillation and whose argument describes rotation:
\[
P(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi_{osc}) \, e^{i(\kappa \omega t + \phi_{rot})}
\]
This path is described geometrically by \(\mathbf{r}(t) = \big(A\cos(\omega t),\, A\sin(\omega t),\, \kappa A\omega t\big)\), where κ is the ratio of rotational to oscillatory advance.

The core operator is the Helical Derivative, \(D_h\), which unites temporal and rotational change:
\[
\frac{d_h P}{dt} \equiv \left(\frac{d}{dt} + i\kappa\omega\right) P(t)
\]
Its second application reveals that chirality increases the effective curvature of the system's path:
\[
\frac{d_h^2 P}{dt^2} = -\omega^2(1+\kappa^2)P(t)
\]
The inverse operator is the Chirality Integral:
\[
\int P(t)\, d_h t = \int P(t)\,(1 + i\kappa)\, dt
\]
The Pirouette Lagrangian, \(\mathcal{L}_p = K_τ - V_Γ\), establishes that for a system under temporal pressure Γ, the stationary action principle \(\delta \int \mathcal{L}_p d_h t = 0\) is satisfied by a helical trajectory. Non-zero κ is therefore the optimal, energy-minimizing state for a persistent resonant system.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** Any system exhibiting stable, long-term temporal resonance must be describable by a characteristic triple \((A, \omega, \kappa)\) with a stable, non-zero κ. A discovery of a truly persistent resonant system whose dynamics are perfectly described by κ = 0 would falsify this law.

## Philosophy
Persistence is not a state of being, but a geometric act. An entity distinguishes itself from transient fluctuation not by what it *is* at any given moment, but by the shape of its path through time. Existence is maintained by a continuous, self-referential turning—a chiral motion that braids oscillation into a stable identity. To be is to pirouette; to cease this coherent spin is to dissolve back into the noise of simple, ephemeral waves.

## Art
A wave is a disturbance that passes. A thing is a knot that time has tied in itself.
