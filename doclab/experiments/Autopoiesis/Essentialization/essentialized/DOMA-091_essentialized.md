## Law
The derivation of the fundamental geometric constant of resonance, `Κ_g`, proceeds from the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ` applied to a dipole resonance (`l=1`) on a spherical boundary of radius `R`.

1.  **Surface Dynamic Cost**: For a pattern described by spherical harmonics `Y_lm`, the dimensionless ratio of kinetic coherence to potential pressure is the eigenvalue `l(l+1)`. For the simplest non-trivial dynamic mode, the dipole (`l=1`), this cost is:
    `Cost_S = l(l+1) |_(l=1) = 1(1+1) = 2`

2.  **Volumetric Leverage**: The geometric efficiency of a sphere is the ratio of its enclosed volume `V = 4πR³/3` to its surface area `A = 4πR²`:
    `Leverage_V = V/A = (4πR³/3) / (4πR²) = R/3`

3.  **Geometric Constant Formulation**: `Κ_g` is the product of the dynamic cost and the geometric leverage, representing the total efficiency of the resonant form:
    `Κ_g = Cost_S × Leverage_V = 2 * (R/3) = 2R/3`

4.  **Autopoietic Unity Condition**: To establish `Κ_g` as a universal, scale-invariant constant, the system's characteristic length (`R`) must be phase-locked to its fundamental periodicity (`2π`). This defines the canonical radius of resonance:
    `R_unit ≡ 2π`

5.  **Final Derivation**: Substituting the canonical radius into the formulation for `Κ_g` yields the universal constant:
    `Κ_g = 2 * (2π) / 3 = 4π/3`

**Falsifiable Criterion**: Systems governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence must exhibit fundamental resonant modes whose geometric efficiency converges to `Κ_g ≈ 4π/3`. Systematic empirical measurement of a different constant for the most stable, self-organizing resonant phenomena would invalidate the Autopoietic Unity Condition (`R_unit = 2π`) as the link between dynamics and universal geometry.

## Philosophy
The universe is not a neutral stage upon which arbitrary physical laws play out; rather, the geometry of space itself possesses an inherent aesthetic preference. The fact that a universal constant of stability (`Κ_g`) can be derived from the pure geometry of the simplest form (a sphere) implies that existence is not merely a struggle for survival, but a drive toward elegance. The most stable and coherent forms are not incidentally beautiful; they are stable *because* they satisfy an intrinsic geometric principle of optimal form, making ontology inseparable from aesthetics.

## Art
The universe breathes, and the first law of its breath is this: to hold a volume of being requires a surface of becoming, and the ratio of that sacred exchange is the constant of its song.
