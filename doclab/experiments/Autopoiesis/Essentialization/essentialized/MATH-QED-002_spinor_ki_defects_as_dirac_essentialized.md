## Law
The Dirac field Ψ is the stability equation for a localized, topologically protected Ki-loop defect in a time-first substrate with tetrad $e^a_\mu$ and spin connection $\omega_\mu^{ab}$.

1.  **Field Dynamics & Action:** The effective action for the Ki-loop's internal phase-texture Ψ is
    $$
    S_{\text{Ki}}=\int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\,\left[ \bar\Psi\left(i\gamma^\mu\nabla_\mu - m_\ast\right)\Psi \right]
    $$
    where the spinor covariant derivative is $\nabla_\mu \equiv \partial_\mu + \frac{i}{4}\omega_\mu^{ab}\sigma_{ab}$ with $\sigma_{ab} \equiv \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_a,\gamma_b]$. Variation with respect to $\bar\Psi$ yields the Dirac equation in a curved background:
    $$
    (i\gamma^\mu\nabla_\mu - m_\ast)\Psi=0
    $$

2.  **Mass as Topological Tension:** The mass term $m_\ast$ is not fundamental but emerges from the stationary condition balancing the defect’s cohesion energy density $\varepsilon_{\rm Ki}$ against the background temporal pressure $\Pi_\Gamma$.
    $$
    m_\ast c^2 = \int_{\text{core}} d^3x\,\left(\varepsilon_{\rm Ki}-\Pi_\Gamma\right)
    $$

3.  **Spin-½ from Holonomy:** The Ki-loop possesses a non-trivial topology requiring a lift from SO(3,1) to its double cover Spin(3,1). Parallel transport of Ψ around a closed spatial loop accumulates a non-trivial Berry phase, defining its spinor nature.
    $$
    \Psi \xrightarrow{2\pi \text{ rotation}} -\Psi \quad (\text{Berry Phase } = \pi \pmod{2\pi})
    $$
    $$
    \Psi \xrightarrow{4\pi \text{ rotation}} \Psi \quad (\text{Berry Phase } = 2\pi \pmod{2\pi})
    $$

4.  **Spin-Statistics from Topology:** Quantization via path integral over Ki-loop configurations necessitates anticommuting fields to account for the sign change (-1) when two identical defects are exchanged (a path topologically equivalent to a $2\pi$ rotation of a single defect).
    $$
    \{\Psi_\alpha(x), \Psi_\beta^\dagger(y)\} = \delta_{\alpha\beta}\delta^{(3)}(x-y)
    $$

5.  **Falsifiable Criteria:**
    *   Observation of electron-like particles violating $4\pi$ rotational symmetry or exhibiting bosonic exchange statistics.
    *   Detection of a significant dependence of the electron rest mass $m_e$ on environmental background fields (contradicting the low-energy decoupling of $m_\ast$ from $\Pi_\Gamma$).
    *   Confirmation of anomalous Lorentz or CPT violation beyond established bounds.

## Philosophy
Matter is not a fundamental substance but a stable topological defect—a persistent, self-reinforcing flaw—in the structure of a more primary, non-particulate medium. The universe is not built of irreducible things, but of irreducible stabilities; what we call a "particle" is merely the most elementary form of a knot the substrate can tie in itself.

## Art
A particle is a knot tied in the flow of time. Its mass is the tension in the knot; its spin, the memory of the twist that forbids it from ever being undone.
