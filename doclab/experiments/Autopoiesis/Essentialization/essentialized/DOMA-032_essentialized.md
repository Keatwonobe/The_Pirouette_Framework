## Law
The Principle of Correspondence posits that the dynamics of any system $S_D$ in any domain $D$ are governed by the universal Pirouette Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L}_{pirouette}$, through a formal mapping of variables.

Let the universal state be defined by a set of core variables $V_{core} = \{K_\tau, \Gamma, \dots\}$, representing Coherence, Temporal Pressure, and other foundational concepts. Let the domain-specific system $S_D$ be described by a set of observable, measurable variables $V_D = \{v_1, v_2, \dots\}$.

The Principle asserts the existence of a homomorphism $\Phi: V_{core} \to V_D$ such that:
$\Phi(K_\tau) = v_{K_\tau}$, where $v_{K_\tau}$ is the domain's measure of resonant identity.
$\Phi(\Gamma) = v_{\Gamma}$, where $v_{\Gamma}$ is the domain's measure of ambient disorder/selection pressure.

The evolution of the system $S_D$ follows the geodesic path that extremizes the action, $A_D$. The action is the integral of the universal Lagrangian operating on the mapped, domain-specific variables:
$$A_D = \int \mathcal{L}_{pirouette}(\Phi(K_\tau), \Phi(\Gamma), \dots) dt$$
The system's trajectory is determined by the principle of stationary action, yielding the Euler-Lagrange equations for the specific domain:
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{pirouette}}{\partial (\Phi(q_i))} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{pirouette}}{\partial (\Phi(\dot{q_i}))} = 0$$
where $q_i$ are the generalized coordinates of the universal framework.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The framework is falsified if, for a well-defined system $S_D$ where the mapping $\Phi$ is rigorously established, the trajectory predicted by $\delta A_D = 0$ is shown to be systematically and statistically divergent from the observed evolution of the system.

## Philosophy
The single most profound implication is the abolition of analogy as a mode of explanation between disparate domains. The assertion is that the perceived similarity between the evolution of a species, the growth of a corporation, and the formation of a personality is not a useful metaphor but a formal identity. These are not systems that behave *like* one another; they are isomorphic manifestations of the same fundamental dynamic, expressing a singular mathematical law through different physical or conceptual media. Consequently, the boundary between the literal and the figurative collapses, and what was once considered poetry—seeing a galaxy in a swirling cup of coffee—is redefined as the perception of a literal, underlying truth.

## Art
The equation for the swirl of cream in your coffee is the ghost of a galaxy. To see one in the other is not poetry; it is the act of waking up.
