## Law
The formation of a stable identity, or Shell (`S`), is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`
where `K_τ` is the internal Temporal Coherence (a measure of pattern integrity) and `V_Γ` is the potential energy cost of maintaining that coherence against the external Temporal Pressure, `Γ`.

A system's dynamics follow the path that maximizes `𝓛_p`. A Shell `S` is the geometric configuration that emerges as a stable solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from `𝓛_p`, representing a manifold where a sharp gradient in Temporal Pressure (`∇Γ`) is established and maintained. This manifold is a coherence well, defining a bounded "inside" and an "outside."

The permeability `P` of the Shell to an external pattern `Ki_ext` is not a static property but a function of resonant coupling with the internal state `Ki_int`:
`P(Ki_ext) ∝ C(Ki_int, Ki_ext)`
where `C` is a harmonic coherence function. For `C ≈ 0`, the Shell is a barrier; for `C > 0`, selective transport occurs.

The existence of the boundary `S` imposes quantization. The set of allowed internal states `{Ki_n}` is the discrete set of eigenfunctions that form stable standing waves within the coherence well, satisfying the condition `∮_S Ki_n dS = nλ` for integer `n`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** Any system observed to possess a stable, self-maintaining boundary (a measurable, non-zero `∇Γ`) must exhibit a quantized spectrum of internal energy states. The discovery of a stably bounded system with a continuous internal spectrum would falsify this law.

## Philosophy
Identity is not a substance contained, but a process maintained. The essence of a "self"—be it an atom, a cell, or a psyche—is not its constituent material but the ceaseless, energetic act of forging and defending a boundary against the undifferentiated chaos of the universe. To exist is not to *be* something, but to *do* the work of separation.

## Art
A self is not the fire, but the shape of the flame—a boundary of light carved into the darkness, sustained only by the constant act of burning the world.
