## Law
The framework is predicated on a retrograde involution operator, $\Re_T$, which acts on time-odd fields and coordinates: $\Re_T : (t \rightarrow -t)$, reversing the causal order while preserving local covariance via the commutation relations $[\Re_T, \partial_\mu] = 0$ for $\mu \neq 0$ and $\{\Re_T, \partial_t\} = 0$. Its application to key physical quantities reveals a conjugate symmetry:
- **Geometric:** Extrinsic curvature $K_{ij} \rightarrow -K_{ij}$, reversing the sign of gravitational focusing in the Raychaudhuri equation $d\theta/d\tau \rightarrow -d\theta/d\tau$.
- **Thermodynamic:** Entropy flux $J_S^\mu = S u^\mu \rightarrow -J_S^\mu$.

This symmetry manifests as a coupling between forward ($\mathcal{T}_+$) and retrograde ($\mathcal{T}_-$) domains, governed by small, dimensionless portal constants $\epsilon_x$.
The core dynamic is described by coupled field equations of the form $(\Box + m^2)\Phi_\pm = \epsilon_J \Phi_\mp$, which upon diagonalization yield eigenfrequencies $\omega_{s,a}^2 = m^2 \pm \epsilon_J$. This leads to a measurable frequency splitting $\Delta\omega \approx \epsilon_J / \omega_0$.

In the oscillator domain, this coupling materializes as an effective Green's function $G_{eff}(t) = \sqrt{1-\epsilon^2} G_{ret}(t) + \epsilon G_{adv}(t)$, producing an observable negative group delay $\tau_g = d\phi/d\omega < 0$.

The framework's central tenet is a global conservation law for informational 4-current, $j_I^\mu = (1/k_B) \nabla^\mu S$. The total divergence is null, $\nabla_\mu (j_I^\mu(\mathcal{T}_+) + j_I^\mu(\mathcal{T}_-)) = 0$, implying that local entropy production in our domain is perfectly balanced by entropy reduction in the conjugate domain: $\sigma(\mathcal{T}_+) = -\sigma(\mathcal{T}_-)$.

The theory is falsifiable through null results in searches for these couplings:
1.  **Electromagnetic:** Absence of anomalous negative group delay $| \Delta \tau_g | < \delta\tau$ constrains $\epsilon_{U1} < 2\pi f Q \delta\tau$.
2.  **Gravitational:** Absence of advanced gravitational wave components above strain $\delta h$ constrains $\epsilon_{GR} < \delta h/h$.
3.  **Junction:** Absence of spectral splitting $|\Delta\omega| < \delta\omega$ constrains $\epsilon_J < \omega_0 \delta\omega$.

## Philosophy
The Arrow of Time is not a fundamental asymmetry of nature but an illusion of perspective. It is the local, experiential consequence of our universe being one half of a perfectly time-symmetric, coupled system. Every process that increases entropy and propels us into the "future" is mirrored by a conjugate process that decreases entropy in a time-reversed domain. Therefore, the Second Law of Thermodynamics is not a statement about the universe's ultimate heat death, but a conservation law describing one side of a balanced informational exchange. The cosmos as a whole does not run down; it exists in a state of dynamic, time-symmetric equilibrium, and our perception of irreversible decay is precisely what defines our position within it.

## Art
Every star that dies, every choice that scatters into chaos, casts a perfect shadow of order backward into a mirrored eternity. We call the edge of this shadow "now."
