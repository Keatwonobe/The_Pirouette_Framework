## Law
A system's state is defined by its resonant Ki pattern, a solution that maximizes the coherence integral, $S_p = \int \mathcal{L}_p \,dt$, where $\mathcal{L}_p$ is the Pirouette Lagrangian. A phase transition, or Chiral Shift, is a discontinuous topological transformation from an unstable pattern, $Ki_{old}$, to a new stable pattern, $Ki_{new}$.

This event is triggered when the combined effect of external Temporal Pressure ($\Gamma$) and internal Coherence Stress ($\sigma_K$) renders the existing state $Ki_{old}$ unsustainable, causing its $\mathcal{L}_p$ to plummet. The probability of a shift is a direct function of these factors:

$$ P(\text{shift}) = 1 - e^{-k \cdot \Gamma \cdot \sigma_K} $$

where $k$ is the system's intrinsic resilience constant.

The system abandons its failing geodesic and tunnels to a new state $Ki_{new}$ which represents a new local maximum for $\mathcal{L}_p$ under the prevailing conditions. The topology of $Ki_{new}$ is constrained to one of three solutions at the Chiral Fork:
1.  **Achromatic:** Non-rotational equilibrium.
2.  **Left-Handed Chiral:** Dynamic rotational equilibrium.
3.  **Right-Handed Chiral:** Opposing dynamic rotational equilibrium.

**Falsifiable Criteria:** The model is falsified if a system undergoes a Chiral Shift without the preceding, observable diagnostic signatures:
1.  Monotonically increasing $\Gamma$ and $\sigma_K$.
2.  Decreasing Time Adherence ($T_a$).
3.  Increasing State Variance.

## Philosophy
The universeâ€™s fundamental response to overwhelming, incoherent stress is not terminal collapse into entropy, but rather a violent, creative leap into a new and more resilient form of order. Crisis is therefore not a failure of a system, but its primary mechanism for radical self-reinvention.
