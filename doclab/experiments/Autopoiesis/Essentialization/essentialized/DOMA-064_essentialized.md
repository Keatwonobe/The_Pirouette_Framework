## Law
The ethical valence of influence is a conserved quantity determined by the system's objective function, the Lagrangian of Intent (ùìõ). Let two systems, an Actor (A) and a Target (T), interact over time. Their individual coherence is denoted by KœÑ.

The interaction is governed by one of two mutually exclusive optimization principles:

1.  **Persuasion (Resonant Synthesis):** A cooperative process maximizing the total coherence of the combined system (A+T).
    $$ \underset{\text{interaction}}{\text{maximize}} \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \left( \mathcal{L}_p(K_\tau(A), \dot{K}_\tau(A)) + \mathcal{L}_p(K_\tau(T), \dot{K}_\tau(T)) \right) dt $$
    This is a positive-sum dynamic.

2.  **Manipulation (Parasitic Resonance):** A competitive process maximizing the coherence of the Actor at the expense of the Target.
    $$ \underset{\text{interaction}}{\text{maximize}} \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \left( \mathcal{L}_p(K_\tau(A), \dot{K}_\tau(A)) - \mathcal{L}_p(K_\tau(T), \dot{K}_\tau(T)) \right) dt $$
    This is a zero-sum or negative-sum dynamic.

These laws yield the following falsifiable criteria:
*   **Coherence Flux (ŒîKœÑ):** An interaction is persuasion if and only if ŒîKœÑ(T) ‚â• 0. It is manipulation if and only if ŒîKœÑ(T) < 0.
*   **Autonomy (Œ©):** Let Œ© be the volume of the accessible solution space. An interaction is persuasion iff Œ©(T)_final > Œ©(T)_initial. It is manipulation iff Œ©(T)_final < Œ©(T)_initial.
*   **System Integrity:** An interaction is persuasion iff KœÑ(A+T)_final > KœÑ(A)_initial + KœÑ(T)_initial.

## Philosophy
Ethics is not a human construct; it is a physical observable. The moral distinction between a creative act (persuasion) and a destructive one (manipulation) is as objective and non-negotiable as the mathematical distinction between constructive and destructive interference. Intent is irrelevant; the universe only measures the net change in systemic coherence.

With every word, you solve an equation for another's world. You either reveal a solution that expands both of you into a greater harmony, or you impose one that requires their diminishment to declare your own existence.
