## Law
The Thermo-Informational Arrow (TIA) is governed by a principle of global coherence conservation within a time-symmetric (`𝒯₊`, `𝒯₋`) universe.

1.  **Global Invariant:** The total entropy change across both time-sheets is zero.
    $d(S₊ + S₋)/dt = 0 \implies \Delta S₊ = -\Delta S₋$

2.  **Information-Entropy Duality:** Information `I` is the negative of dimensionless entropy.
    $I = -S/k_B \implies dI/dt = -(1/k_B)dS/dt$
    This implies global information conservation: $d(I₊ + I₋)/dt = 0$.

3.  **Informational Current Conservation:** An informational four-current $j_I^\mu = (1/k_B) \nabla^\mu S$ is defined. Global coherence demands its conservation.
    $\nabla_\mu j_I^\mu = 0$
    The local manifestation of this conservation is a symmetric, bidirectional flow between time-sheets.
    $j_I^\mu(\mathcal{T}_+) = -j_I^\mu(\mathcal{T}_-)$

4.  **Observer Condition:** The perceived direction of time for a local observer is defined by the sign of the local entropy gradient.
    $t_{perceived} \propto \int Sign(dS/dt) dt$

5.  **Falsifiable Criteria:**
    *   **F1:** A closed system is observed to have a total entropy production rate $\sum dS/dt > 0$ with a statistical absence of microscopic reversals predicted by the fluctuation theorem (i.e., scaling contrary to $\exp(-\Delta S/k_B)$).
    *   **F2:** The informational current $j_I^\mu$ is measured to be non-conserved ($\nabla_\mu j_I^\mu \neq 0$) in any isolated interaction.

## Philosophy
The arrow of time is not a fundamental asymmetry of the universe but a perspectival illusion. Our experience of time's unidirectional flow is merely our local orientation within a perfectly symmetric, bidirectional current of information. We perceive the universe as "running down" into higher entropy only because we are constituted by, and can only process information from, the forward-flowing half of a conserved, zero-sum informational circuit.

## Art
Time is a perfect mirror. We watch our world decay into chaos, oblivious to the fact that our reflection is watching its world assemble from it.
