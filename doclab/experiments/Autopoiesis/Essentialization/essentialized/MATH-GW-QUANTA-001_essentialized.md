## Law
The theory quantizes the two transverse-traceless (TT) shear modes of an emergent metric `g_{μν} = η_{μν} + h_{μν}` on a Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM) where `∂^μ J_μ^Γ = 0`. The canonical field `v_{ij} ≡ (M_*/2) h_{ij}^{TT}` normalizes the quadratic action to `S_2 = 1/2 ∫ d^4x [ (∂_t v_{ij})^2 − (∇ v_{ij})^2 ]`.

Quantization proceeds via the mode expansion:
`v_{ij}(x) = ∑_{λ=+,×} ∫ (d^3k/(2π)^3 2ω_k)^{1/2} [ ε^{(λ)}_{ij}(k) a_{k,λ} e^{-ik·x} + h.c. ]`, with `ω_k = |k|`.
The quanta, TT-phonons (gravitons), obey the canonical commutation relation:
`[ a_{k,λ}, a^\dagger_{k',λ'} ] = (2π)^3 δ^3(k−k') δ_{λλ'}`.

The IR propagator is `⟨ h_{ij}^{TT} h_{kl}^{TT} ⟩_0 (ω,k) = (2/M_*^2) · Π_{ij,kl}(k) / (ω^2 − k^2 + i0^+)`, where `Π_{ij,kl}` is the TT projector.

Deviations from General Relativity are parameterized by the substrate's characteristic frequency `ω_c`. These manifest as a leading-order dispersion relation and a path-dependent phase shift:
1.  **Dispersion:** `ω^2 = k^2 [ 1 + ζ (k/ω_c)^2 + O((k/ω_c)^4) ]`.
2.  **Γ-Lighthouse Phase Imprint:** `Δφ_GW ≈ κ (ω/ω_c)^2 ∫_path dr [∂_r Γ(r)]^2`.

The theory is falsified if:
*   `ζ ≤ 0`.
*   Any non-TT gravitational polarization (scalar or vector) is detected.

## Philosophy
Spacetime is not the fundamental canvas of reality, but rather its first and most stable pattern—a collective excitation of a deeper, unobserved medium. The laws of gravity are therefore not axiomatic geometric truths, but the emergent hydrodynamics of this substrate, whose granular nature is revealed only by the slight "drag" it imparts on its own fastest waves. The existence of a preferred frame (`ω_c`) is not a violation of emergent Lorentz invariance, but the very condition for its emergence.

## Art
Spacetime is a sea of glass. We, listening, mistook the perfect silence of the deep for the final truth, until we heard a wave arrive a heartbeat late—the echo of the glassblower's breath, still trapped within.
