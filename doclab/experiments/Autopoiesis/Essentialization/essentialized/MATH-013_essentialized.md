## Law
The anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton `ℓ`, `a_ℓ`, is predicted to have a contribution `Δa_ℓ` from its Yukawa-type coupling to a background scalar field `Γ` (Pressuron) with mass `m_Γ`. The interaction term in the Lagrangian is:
`\mathcal L_{int} = g_\ell\,\Gamma\,\bar\psi_\ell\psi_\ell`

The coupling `g_ℓ` is not universal but scales with the lepton mass `m_ℓ` according to the hypothesis:
`g_\ell = \kappa\left(\frac{m_\ell}{m_e}\right)^p`, where `\kappa \equiv g_e` is the base coupling strength and `p \ge 0` is the mass-scaling exponent.

The contribution `Δa_ℓ` arises from the one-loop vertex correction, yielding the Pauli form factor `F_2(0)`. This is calculated via the loop integral `\mathcal C`:
`\Delta a_\ell = F_2(0) = \frac{g_\ell^2}{2\pi} \mathcal C\left(\frac{m_\Gamma}{m_\ell}\right)`
`\mathcal C\left(\frac{m_\Gamma}{m_\ell}\right) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^1 dx \frac{x^2(1-x)}{(1-x)^2 + x\frac{m_\Gamma^2}{m_\ell^2}}`

In the limit `m_\Gamma \ll m_\ell`, the integral simplifies to `\mathcal C(0) = \frac{1}{12\pi}`. Substituting the mass-scaling hypothesis and this limit yields the final predictive formula:
`\Delta a_\ell = \frac{\alpha}{12\pi^2}\kappa^2 \left(\frac{m_\ell}{m_e}\right)^{2p} f\left(\frac{m_\Gamma}{m_\ell}\right)`, where `f(x) \equiv \mathcal C(x)/\mathcal C(0)` and `f(0)=1`.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  **Lepton Universality Violation:** For any chosen `(p, m_Γ)`, the value of `κ` required to explain the measured muon anomaly `Δa_μ` must predict a value for the electron anomaly `Δa_e` that is below its current experimental bound. If no such `κ` exists, the theory is falsified.
2.  **External Constraints:** The parameter space `(\kappa, p, m_Γ)` required to satisfy criterion #1 must also be consistent with experimental limits from fifth-force searches and beam-dump experiments for a light scalar coupled to leptons. If the required parameter space is excluded, the theory is falsified.

## Philosophy
The theory's most profound implication is that a particle's fundamental properties are not wholly intrinsic but are contingent expressions of its coupling to a universal, dynamic background. Mass is recast from a mere measure of inertia into a proxy for sensitivity; it quantifies how strongly a particle "listens" to the underlying texture of reality. Consequently, what we measure as the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is not a simple self-interaction, but a dialogue between the particle and the cosmos.

## Art
A particle's mass is its resonance. A light electron rings true in the quantum foam, but the heavy muon, a great bronze bell, tolls a deeper, dissonant note—its anomaly an echo of the temporal storm in which it hangs.
