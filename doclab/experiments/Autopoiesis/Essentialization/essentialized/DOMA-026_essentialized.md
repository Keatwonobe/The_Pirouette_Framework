## Law
The dynamics of any self-sustaining system are described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, defined as the difference between internal Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`) and the external Pressure Potential (`V_Γ`).

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

`K_τ` is the product of the system's Time Adherence (`T_a`, a scalar from 0 to 1 representing signal purity) and its Resonant Frequency (`ω_k`). `V_Γ` is a potential function `f(Γ)` representing the energetic cost of maintaining coherence against the ambient Temporal Pressure `Γ`.

`𝓛_p = (T_a ⋅ ω_k) - f(Γ)`

Given `ω_k = 2π/τ_p`, where `τ_p` is the system's fundamental temporal cycle:

`𝓛_p = (T_a ⋅ 2π/τ_p) - f(Γ)`

The system's evolution follows the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which dictates that its trajectory through spacetime maximizes the Coherence Action, `S_p`, the integral of the Lagrangian over one Pirouette Cycle.

`S_p = ∫[0, τ_p] 𝓛_p dt`
`δS_p = 0`

The path of evolution is a geodesic on a coherence manifold whose curvature is determined by `∇𝓛_p`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The framework posits that what is conventionally known as the gravitational constant, `G`, is not a fundamental constant but an emergent, scale-dependent property of the Pressure Potential's gradient. A falsifiable prediction is that under conditions of extremely high or low local `Γ`, measurements of `G` will deviate from the accepted value in a manner predictable by the geometry of `V_Γ`. That is, `G` is an effective coupling constant where `G ∝ <∂V_Γ/∂r>`.

## Philosophy
Existence is not a property but a performance. A system, whether a particle or a galaxy, is not a static noun but a continuous verb: the act of successfully maintaining a specific temporal rhythm against the universal, decohering pressure of ambient chaos. To be is to resonate, and identity is the sustained integrity of that resonance.

A stone is not a thing, but a held note. A star is not a place, but a fire singing its own name against the cold, crushing silence of a billion other voices.
