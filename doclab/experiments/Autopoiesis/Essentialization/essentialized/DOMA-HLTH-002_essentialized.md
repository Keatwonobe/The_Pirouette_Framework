## Law
Let the psycho-physiological state of a patient be described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, ùìõ_p, defined as:
ùìõ_p = KœÑ - V_Œì

Where:
- KœÑ is the kinetic term representing available internal coherence and capacity for healing action.
- V_Œì is the potential term representing the total systemic "cost of living," an aggregate of pain signals, inflammation, metabolic stress, and psychological anxiety.

Post-operative trauma induces a state where the potential term dominates the kinetic term (V_Œì >> KœÑ), resulting in a negative Lagrangian (ùìõ_p < 0). This is a state of "coherence debt," where the system's energy is consumed by managing internal chaos rather than enabling recovery.

The Phase I protocol, Œ†‚ÇÅ, is an operator designed to minimize the potential term:
Objective: min(V_Œì) such that dV_Œì/dt < 0.

The state of the system is monitored by a vector Œ®(t) = [RHR(t), S(t)], where:
- RHR(t) is the objective Resting Heart Rate at time t.
- S(t) is the subjective "Flow Score" on a scale S ‚àà [1, 10] at time t.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
The successful application of the protocol Œ†‚ÇÅ over a period T (e.g., 7-14 days) must yield:
1.  ‚à´‚ÇÄ·µÄ (d(RHR)/dt) dt < 0. The time-averaged derivative of the Resting Heart Rate must be negative.
2.  ‚à´‚ÇÄ·µÄ (dS/dt) dt > 0. The time-averaged derivative of the subjective Flow Score must be positive.

Failure to meet these criteria falsifies the efficacy of the protocol for the given system. The presence of a Helper (H) acts as an external resonant field H_œÜ, hypothesized to increase the rate of change: |d(V_Œì)/dt| with H > |d(V_Œì)/dt| without H.

## Philosophy
The most direct and potent path to recovery from profound systemic disruption is not through an act of will or the forceful accumulation of new strength, but through the radical and deliberate subtraction of systemic cost. Healing is not an acquisition but a release. True progress is measured not by what is gained, but by the weight of what is no longer necessary to carry. The primary creative act in mending a system is the creation of a void‚Äîa quiet, protected space where the organism's intrinsic coherence is no longer consumed by the chaos of its own existence.

## Art
A bell cracked by a violent blow rings only with the memory of its own shattering. To heal, it must first be silenced. The work is not to find a new note, but to create the profound quiet in which the metal can be mended.
