## Law
The cosmological dynamics of a canonical scalar field Γ are governed by the Klein-Gordon equation in a Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric (conformal time η, scale factor a(η), ℋ=a′/a, Newtonian gauge potentials Φ,Ψ):
Γ′′ + 2ℋ Γ′ + a² V_{,Γ}(Γ) = 0
This field contributes to the background energy density ρ_Γ and pressure p_Γ, sourcing the expansion via the Friedmann equation:
ρ_Γ = (Γ′²)/(2a²) + V(Γ)
p_Γ = (Γ′²)/(2a²) − V(Γ)
ℋ² = (8πG/3) a² (ρ_r + ρ_b + ρ_Γ)

Linear perturbations δΓ evolve according to:
δΓ′′ + 2ℋ δΓ′ + (k² + a² V_{,ΓΓ}) δΓ = 4 Γ′ Φ′ − 2 a² V_{,Γ} Φ
These perturbations source the metric potentials through their contribution to the total density perturbation δρ_tot = Σ_s δρ_s:
δρ_Γ = (1/a²) (Γ′ δΓ′ − Γ′² Φ) + V_{,Γ} δΓ
k² Φ + 3ℋ (Φ′ + ℋ Ψ) = 4πG a² δρ_tot
In the oscillatory regime where the field mass m_Γ ≫ H, the field behaves as a fluid with a scale-dependent effective sound speed:
c_{s,eff}²(k,a) ≈ (k²/a²) / (4 m_Γ² + k²/a²)

The system is closed by specifying adiabatic initial conditions for δΓ on super-horizon scales (k ≪ ℋ):
δΓ_ini = − (Γ′/ℋ) Φ_ini

The theory is falsifiable if a single, fixed set of potential parameters (U_parameters: {m_Γ, λ₄, V_tail}) and topological parameters (T_indices), established by an immutable "Freeze Manifest," fails to simultaneously:
1.  Reproduce Cosmic Microwave Background angular power spectra (TT, TE, EE, lensing) consistent with observation (e.g., Planck).
2.  Reproduce the matter density fluctuation amplitude fσ₈(z) from independent cosmological models.
3.  Generate self-consistent astrophysical structures (e.g., halo profiles, merger dynamics) whose properties derive solely from the frozen fundamental parameters.

## Philosophy
A physical theory is not merely a set of differential equations, but a fully-specified, computationally-instantiated, and cryptographically-frozen cascade of logic. By anchoring the model's fundamental parameters in a version-controlled "Freeze Manifest," the framework mandates that all phenomena, from the cosmic microwave background to the collision of individual galaxy clusters, must be derivable consequences of a single, non-negotiable set of initial choices. This elevates reproducibility from a methodological virtue to a core principle of the theory itself, asserting that the universe's consistency is mirrored in our model's computational integrity.

## Art
The universe is a crystal grown from a single, frozen seed of information; its every galactic facet and filament an inevitable consequence of that initial, immutable lattice point.
