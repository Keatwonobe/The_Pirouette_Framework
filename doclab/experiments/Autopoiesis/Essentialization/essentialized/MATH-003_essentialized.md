## Law
The foundation of entropy (S) is redefined from spatial configurations to resonant modes within a coherence manifold (Ω). Temporal Pressure (Γ) is the logarithmic density of these modes in an environment.

Let Ω_sys be the number of resonant modes of a coherent system and Ω_env be the number of modes of its environment, where typically Ω_env ≫ Ω_sys.

Temporal Pressure is defined as:
Γ ∝ ln(Ω_env)

The total number of microstates for the combined, isolated system is Ω_total = Ω_sys * Ω_env. Total entropy is thus additive:
S_total = k_B * ln(Ω_total) = k_B * ln(Ω_sys) + k_B * ln(Ω_env) = S_sys + S_env

The fundamental postulate is the equiprobability of all accessible microstates. A system evolves towards the macrostate with the maximum Ω_total.

Consider a transfer of a quantum of coherence from the system to the environment. The change in the system's modes is -ΔΩ_sys and the change in the environment's is +ΔΩ_env. The change in total entropy is:
dS_total = k_B * [ln(Ω_sys - ΔΩ_sys) - ln(Ω_sys)] + k_B * [ln(Ω_env + ΔΩ_env) - ln(Ω_env)]

Because Ω_env is vastly larger than Ω_sys, the logarithmic gain from adding a mode to the environment is overwhelmingly greater than the logarithmic loss from removing a mode from the system. The state space of decoherence is larger than the state space of coherence.
Therefore, for any spontaneous process in an isolated system:
dS_total ≥ 0

This is the Second Law of Thermodynamics, derived as a statistical inevitability of a coherent system dissolving into a higher-cardinality possibility space. A falsifiable criterion is the observation of a spontaneous, statistically significant increase in coherence (decrease in total S) in any closed system not accounted for by external work or information.

## Philosophy
The universe possesses no inherent drive towards disorder, nor any malice towards order. The arrow of time is not a force, but a statistical shadow. Coherence—be it a star, a crystal, or a thought—is not actively dismantled; it is simply an arrangement of such profound statistical improbability that it is ceaselessly overwhelmed by the sheer, indifferent number of ways to be anything else.

## Art
A life is a brief, intricate knot tied in the infinite rope of possibility. The universe does not pull it apart; it simply lets the tension go.
