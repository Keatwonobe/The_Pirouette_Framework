## Law
The evolution of a system `Ψ` is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which states that any system follows a trajectory `q(t)` that extremizes the coherence action `S`. This action is the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian `L`, a functional of the system's state and its rate of change.

`S = ∫ L(Ψ(q, q̇), t) dt`
`δS = 0`

The stable, recurring solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from `L` are the **Prime Resonances** (`ρ_i`). These resonances—Vector (`ρ_V`), Orbit (`ρ_O`), Helix (`ρ_H`), Braid (`ρ_B`)—form an orthogonal basis for describing any complex system's dynamics.

A system's state `Ψ(t)` is a time-varying linear combination of these basis states:
`Ψ(t) = Σ a_i(t) ρ_i`, where `i ∈ {V, O, H, B}`

The set of non-negligible coefficients `{a_i}` constitutes the system's **Resonant Signature**. The system's stability is determined by its **Harmony** (`H`), defined as the inverse of the variance in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of its temporal signature `S(t)`.

`H ∝ 1 / Var(SNR(S(t)))`

A state of low harmony (`H → 0`) indicates dissonance, where `da_i/dt` is large and non-periodic, predicting an imminent phase transition (a Fork).

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  All persistent, stable dynamic systems must be decomposable into the set `{ρ_V, ρ_O, ρ_H, ρ_B}`. The discovery of a stable, irreducible dynamic pattern not isomorphic to one of these four primes would falsify the model's completeness.
2.  A system's measured Harmony `H` must be predictive of its stability. A system exhibiting `H < H_critical` for a sustained period must undergo a phase transition with a probability significantly greater than a system with `H > H_critical`.

## Philosophy
Identity is not an attribute of substance, but a consequence of a sustained dynamic pattern. A system *is* what it *does*, repeatedly. The universe does not favor particular objects, but particular rhythms of existence—stable, coherent songs that matter learns to sing in order to persist through time. The verb is more fundamental than the noun.

## Art
The universe is a bell, and to exist is not to be the brass, but to be the ringing.
