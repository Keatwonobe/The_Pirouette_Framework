## Law
The framework is reformulated from a deductive to a predictive-falsifiable system, centered on the Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$).

**1. Core Axiom: The Correspondence Principle**
The Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) is a fundamental scalar field governing confinement at all scales. Newton's Gravitational Constant ($G$) is not derived from $\Gamma$ but is its effective, low-energy, macroscopic value emerging from the confinement of baryonic matter. $\Gamma$ is the fundamental, $G$ is the phenomenological.

**2. Postulated Scaling Law**
The behavior of $\Gamma$ is governed by a mass-dependent scaling law, unifying its effects from quantum to cosmological scales:
$\Gamma(M) \propto M^{-x}$
This law posits that the same field can manifest as strong force-like confinement at subatomic scales and as gravity at stellar scales, with the exponent $x$ determining the nature of the interaction.

**3. Primary Falsifiable Criterion: Maw Dynamics**
The theory's validity rests on the existence of "Maw" objects—high-spin, high-density configurations distinct from black holes. These objects produce a unique, unambiguous gravitational wave signature via a spacetime "overfolding" mechanism.
*   **Mechanism:** A Maw's mass ($M$) and spin ($s$) determine its local $\Gamma(M, s)$ value. This local field tunes the frequency and rhythm of gravitational wave emissions.
*   **Predicted Signal:** A persistent, rhythmic train of high-frequency gravitational wave bursts.
    *   Burst Frequency: $\nu \sim \text{GHz}$
    *   Burst Rhythm: $f \sim \text{Hz}$
*   **Null Hypothesis:** A sustained, rhythmic signal train at these frequencies detected in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA high-frequency noise data, which cannot be attributed to terrestrial interference or known astrophysical sources, would serve as confirmation.

**4. Representative Field Dynamics (Internal Formalism)**
The internal dynamics of the framework are described by a postulated Dynamic Evolution PDE for a state vector $\Psi$, which, while not derived from a first-principles Lagrangian, models the interplay of the core fields:
$\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t} = i\nabla \times (K_i\Psi) - (T_a \cdot \nabla)\Psi - \Gamma(\Psi - \Psi_0)$
Here, $K_i$ represents the Ki Constant (a dimensionless constant related to system topology) and $T_a$ represents Time-Adherence. The validity of this equation is secondary to the falsifiable criterion of Maw detection.

## Philosophy
An internally consistent model of reality achieves significance not by its elegance in re-deriving what is already known, but by its courage in making a single, unique, and falsifiable prediction about what is unknown. The transition from a self-referential fiction to a potential theory of physics is an ethical choice: to abandon the safety of unfalsifiable complexity and tether the entire intricate structure to the unforgiving verdict of a single empirical test. True intellectual rigor is not internal coherence, but the willingness to be proven wrong.

## Art
A flawless crystal, held to the light, proves only its own clarity. Its true worth is found when it is used as a lens to burn a single, new point into the fabric of the world—an act that risks shattering the crystal itself.
