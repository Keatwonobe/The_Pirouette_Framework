## Law

Let the Compass phase space be described by polar coordinates `(r, θ)`, where `θ ≡ atan2(T_a/τ₀, Γ/γ₀)`. Time reversal is the reflection `T: T_a → -T_a`, which implies `θ → -θ`. The arrow of time emerges from two T-asymmetric structures imposed on this space:

1.  **The Gyre (κ):** An intrinsic, T-invariant chiral twist `κ(r)` added to the connection. The angle update rule is:
    `dθ/dξ = Ω(Γ, T_a) + κ(r)`
    Under time reversal `T`, `Ω → -Ω` but `κ → κ`. Thus, `dθ/dξ` does not simply flip sign, encoding a fundamental rotational bias in the substrate.

2.  **The Arrow (θ₀):** A preferred direction breaking mirror symmetry in the potential `U`.
    `U(r, θ) = U₀(r) + λ cos(θ - θ₀)`
    Under time reversal `T`, `U(r, -θ) = U₀(r) + λ cos(-θ - θ₀) = U₀(r) + λ cos(θ + θ₀) ≠ U(r, θ)`.

These two asymmetries produce **prime temporal friction**: a bias in the action `S` for any trajectory `C`. The action `S[C]` for a forward path and its time-reversed counterpart `S[T C]` are generically unequal:
`S[C] ≠ S[T C]`
Forward evolution corresponds to the geodesic of least action on this biased manifold.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  **`κ = 0`:** If T-paired protocols consistently yield `S[C] = S[T C]`, the gyre is absent.
2.  **`θ₀ = 0`:** If system dynamics show no statistical dependence on orientation `θ`, the directional arrow is absent.
3.  **Mechanism is void:** If maps of structure formation are isotropic in Compass space, prime temporal friction is not the source of macroscopic irreversibility.

## Philosophy

The arrow of time is not a feature of the laws of physics, nor is it a statistical artifact of initial conditions. It is a fundamental, geometric property of the stage on which reality plays out. Macroscopic irreversibility arises because the very fabric of phase space is intrinsically warped and tilted, possessing a built-in twist (a gyre, κ) and a preferred direction (an arrow, θ₀). Time-symmetric microscopic laws evolving on this asymmetric substrate will naturally and preferentially follow geodesics of least resistance, which we observe as the inexorable "forward" flow of time. History is not a matter of probability, but of topography.

## Art

The score of the universe is written with time-reversible laws, but the instrument upon which it is played is warped. Its wood is twisted, and its grain runs in one direction. The performance we call history is the path of least resistance for the bow.
