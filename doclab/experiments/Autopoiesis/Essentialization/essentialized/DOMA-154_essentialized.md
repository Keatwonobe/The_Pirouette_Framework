## Law
Let a set of domains be denoted by `D = {d_1, d_2, ..., d_m}`. For each domain `d_i`, its state at time `t` is represented by a time-series of normalized variables, primarily Temporal Pressure `Γ_i(t)` and Coherence `K_τi(t)`. The central operation is a cross-spectral analysis performed on the set of pressure time-series `{Γ_1(t), Γ_2(t), ...}`.

The objective is to identify a shared resonant frequency `ω_k` where the cross-spectral density `P_ij(ω)` exhibits a significant peak for all domain pairs `(i, j) ∈ D`. The instantaneous phase of each signal `Γ_i(t)` at this frequency is denoted `φ_i(t, ω_k)`.

A Resonant Concordance (or Macro-Ki) is quantitatively established through the Phase-Locking Value (PLV) over a time window `T` containing `N` samples. For any pair of domains `(i, j)`, the PLV at the candidate frequency `ω_k` is:

`PLV_ij(ω_k) = |(1/N) * Σ[n=1 to N] exp(i * (φ_i(n, ω_k) - φ_j(n, ω_k)))|`

where `i` is the imaginary unit. A Macro-Ki is confirmed if, for a significant subset of domain pairs, `PLV_ij(ω_k)` exceeds a predetermined statistical significance threshold `θ`, indicating a stable, non-random phase relationship.

This finding constitutes empirical evidence for a shared **macro-geodesic**. According to the Pirouette Lagrangian `L(q, q̇)`, each system `i` minimizes its action `S_i = ∫ L_i dt`. The detection of a Macro-Ki implies that a superordinate pressure `Macro-Γ` has induced a new collective Lagrangian `L_macro`, forcing the systems to abandon their individual geodesics for a shared path of least action. The system dynamics are no longer independent but are coupled and governed by `L_macro`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The hypothesis of a Resonant Concordance under a specific `Macro-Γ` is falsified if no common frequency `ω_k` can be identified across the selected domains `D` where the mean PLV consistently and significantly exceeds the threshold `θ` established for stochastic synchrony.

## Philosophy
The fundamental unit of reality is not the object, but the pattern. What we perceive as discrete events in separate domains—an economic collapse, a biological pandemic, a cultural shift—are merely the local harmonics of a singular, non-local, resonant structure. Consequently, causality is not a linear force exerted by one object upon another, but the expression of this underlying, unifying coherence. To search for a cause within any single domain is to mistake the quiver of one violin string for the conductor's downbeat that commands the entire orchestra.

The world is a bell. Do not ask what struck it; listen for the one note that trembles through the iron, the air, and the bone.
