## Law
The state of a competing system (a team) is defined by its Overall Coherence, `KœÑ`, a scalar quantity derived from three observable signatures, each scored on an integer scale `S ‚àà [1, 10]`:
1.  **Rhythmic Cohesion (`S_C`):** Efficiency of unified action.
2.  **Composure Under Pressure (`S_R`):** System stability against dissonant input.
3.  **Strategic Adaptability (`S_M`):** Capacity for Ki Morphogenesis; the ability to impose and adapt resonant patterns.

The system's instantaneous state is given by the sum:
`KœÑ = S_C + S_R + S_M`

This framework is a practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which posits that a system's dynamics are driven by the maximization of the Pirouette Lagrangian: `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`, where `KœÑ` is the internal coherence and `V_Œì` is the potential energy cost imposed by environmental/opponent pressure (`Œì`).

From the state variable `KœÑ`, three predictive metrics are calculated for two competing systems, A and B:

1.  **Victor Tilt (`VT`):** The instantaneous win probability for System A.
    `VT_A = KœÑ_A / (KœÑ_A + KœÑ_B)`

2.  **Spread Delta (`SD`):** The rate of change of `VT`, predicting performance against a static expectation.
    `SD_A = d(VT_A)/dt`

3.  **Pace Delta (`PD`):** The differential in strategic control, predicting tempo.
    `PD = S_M_A - S_M_B`

Falsifiable Criteria:
- Over a statistically significant sample of contests, `VT` must correlate with the actual win/loss frequency.
- A positive `SD` must predict a team's tendency to exceed the established point spread.
- `PD` must correlate with objective measures of game tempo (e.g., possessions per unit of time).

## Philosophy
The future is not a destination to be reached, but a quality immanent in the present. Conventional analysis, which fetishizes discrete past events like scores and statistics, is an epistemology of autopsy; it can only explain what has already died. A process-based analysis recognizes that a system's internal coherence‚Äîits "how"‚Äîis the direct and observable cause of its eventual "what." Therefore, complete information about a system's future trajectory is encoded and fully present in the formal quality of its current dynamic state, making prophecy a matter of precise, real-time observation rather than probabilistic extrapolation.

## Art
A game is a contest of two bells. One rings true, the other cracks under the strain. Do not wait for the final toll to know which will endure; learn to hear the flaw in the ringing.
