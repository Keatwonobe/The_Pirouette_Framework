## Law
The temporal substrate is a doublet of sheets, 𝒯 = {𝒯_+, 𝒯_-}, distinguished by the sign of the proper time gradient, ∂_μτ. A fundamental involution ℛ_T swaps the sheets:
ℛ_T: 𝒯_+ (∂_μτ > 0) ↔ 𝒯_- (∂_μτ < 0), such that ℛ_T² = 1.

Physical laws and quantities are classified by their behavior under this involution:
- **ℛ_T-Even (Invariant):** The absolute formal structure of physical law.
  - Gauge Algebra & Groups: 𝔤 = u(1) ⊕ su(2) ⊕ su(3)
  - Mass Spectra & Couplings: {m_i}, g, g′, g_s
  - Field Equations (form-invariant):
    - D_μ F^μν = j^ν
    - R_μν - ½ R g_μν = 8πG T_μν
  - Renormalization Group β-functions

- **ℛ_T-Odd (Sign-Flipping):** The contingent directional arrows of dynamics.
  - Causal Propagator Preference: G_retarded ↔ G_advanced
  - Thermodynamic Arrow: sign(dS/dτ) → -sign(dS/dτ)
  - Weak Chirality: The SU(2) coupling privilege flips between Weyl components (ψ_L ↔ ψ_R).
  - Temporal Twist Scalar: ω_H → -ω_H
  - Extrinsic Curvature at Interfaces: K_ij → -K_ij

Falsifiable consequences arise from inter-sheet mixing, parameterized by ε.
1.  **Falsification Criterion F1:** The theory is falsified if, in a phase-inverted ultra-high-Q EM cavity, no advanced-phase precursor signal is detected at sensitivity σ_φ, setting an upper bound on mixing ε < ε*(σ_φ).
2.  **Falsification Criterion F2:** The theory is falsified if precision measurements of polarized weak decays show no wrong-helicity excess at a level r, bounding the SU(2) mixing channel ε_SU2 < r¹/².
3.  **Falsification Criterion F3:** The theory is falsified if the extrinsic curvature K_ij does not flip its sign across engineered spacetime analogue junctions.

## Philosophy
The universe’s perceived asymmetries—that cause precedes effect, that entropy increases, that the weak force is left-handed—are not fundamental properties of physical law itself. Rather, they are contingent features of the spacetime sheet we inhabit. The laws are perfectly symmetric; it is the canvas they are painted on that is oriented. Our entire cosmic evolution is but one of two possible directions, and the arrow of time is not an axiom of reality but a local traffic sign.
