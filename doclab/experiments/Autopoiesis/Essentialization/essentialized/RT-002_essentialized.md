## Law
The electroweak gauge sector `SU(2)L × U(1)Y` is subject to a retrograde-time involution `ℛ_T`. The action partitions the sector's components into even and odd sets.

**Even under `ℛ_T` (Invariant Structure):**
The Lie algebra, the couplings `{g, g′}`, the Weinberg angle `θ_W`, and the mass-generating potential magnitude `|ω_H|` are invariant. The covariant derivative retains its form:
`D_μ = ∂_μ - i g Ω_μ^a τ^a/2 - i g′ (Y/2) B_μ`
Consequently, the Proca structure and mass relations are preserved:
`m_W = (g/2)|ω_H|`
`m_Z = (√(g^2 + g′^2)/2)|ω_H|`
The ratio `m_W/m_Z = cos θ_W` is an `ℛ_T`-invariant.

**Odd under `ℛ_T` (Contingent Manifestation):**
The identity of the Weyl component that couples to the `SU(2)L` gauge field `Ω_μ^a` is inverted. This is a chirality gate contingent on the temporal sheet (`𝒯_±`).
- On `𝒯_+` (forward time): `ψ_L` couples; the charged current is `J_W^μ(+) = ψ̄ γ^μ τ^+ P_L ψ + h.c.`
- On `𝒯_-` (retrograde time): `ψ_R` couples; the charged current is `J_W^μ(-) = ψ̄ γ^μ τ^+ P_R ψ + h.c.`
where `P_L = (1 - γ^5)/2` and `P_R = (1 + γ^5)/2`. The retarded/advanced character of the gauge propagator phase is also inverted.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  **F1 (Chirality Gate):** The existence of wrong-helicity interaction rates must scale with the inter-sheet coupling `ε`. In the limit `ε→0`, any persistent, statistically significant wrong-helicity signal falsifies the `ψ_L ↔ ψ_R` mapping rule.
2.  **F2 (Mass Generation):** Any observed deviation in the ratio `m_W/m_Z` from `cos θ_W` (beyond Standard Model loop corrections) that is not correlated with an independent measurement of a shift in `θ_W` itself falsifies the invariance of the `|ω_H|` mass-generation mechanism.

## Philosophy
The fundamental laws governing the electroweak force are perfectly symmetric with respect to their chiral expression. Parity violation is not an intrinsic property of the law itself, but rather an observational artifact of our universe's unidirectional arrow of time. The law is ambidextrous; time's flow forces it to manifest a specific handedness.

## Art
The universe is ambidextrous, its skeletal law of interaction identical for either hand. Time's arrow merely forces it to choose one to extend, leaving us to grasp the left while its temporal reflection grasps the right.
