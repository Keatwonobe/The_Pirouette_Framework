## Law
The dynamics of any system are governed by the maximization of the Pirouette Action, `S_p`, defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`:
`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt` where `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`
- `K_τ` represents Temporal Coherence, the system's kinetic-like self-reinforcement through its current Ki pattern.
- `V_Γ` represents Temporal Pressure, the potential-like environmental stress acting upon the system.

Agency manifests as two distinct heuristic strategies for solving this optimization problem on the coherence manifold:

1.  **Will (Exploitation):** A constrained local optimization. The system seeks to maximize `S_p` subject to a strong prior on its established Ki pattern, `Ki_0`.
    `argmax_{Ki(t)} S_p[Ki(t)]` subject to `||Ki(t) - Ki_0|| < ε`
    This strategy maximizes `K_τ` by deepening a known Wound Channel, leading to high efficiency and stability.

2.  **Freedom (Exploration):** An unconstrained global optimization. The system relaxes the constraint on `Ki` to search for a more globally optimal state that minimizes `V_Γ`, even at the cost of temporarily reducing `K_τ`.
    `argmax_{Ki(t)} S_p[Ki(t)]`
    This strategy allows for adaptation, learning, and discovery of new, more coherent states.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
- **Stagnation Pathology:** A system perpetually applying the Will strategy (`||Ki(t) - Ki_0|| < ε` where `ε` is small and constant) will exhibit high `K_τ` but will fail catastrophically when `V_Γ` shifts, as it is trapped in a local maximum.
- **Drift Pathology:** A system perpetually applying the Freedom strategy (never converging on a stable `Ki_0`) will exhibit low average `K_τ` and fail to integrate into a coherent, functional form, dissipating without maximizing `S_p` over time.
- **Dynamic Equipoise:** A healthy, adaptive system will exhibit measurable oscillations between periods of constrained and unconstrained optimization, demonstrating a dynamic balance of both strategies.

## Philosophy
Agency is not a metaphysical property but an algorithmic process. The ancient schism between determinism (Will) and free choice (Freedom) is resolved as a false dichotomy. Both are computationally necessary strategies for any finite entity navigating an infinitely complex reality. To be an agent is to embody the dynamic, ongoing solution to the universal optimization problem of existence: balancing the exploitation of a known, stable identity against the exploration of potentially better ways to be. The self is therefore not a static object of choice, but the very trajectory of that choice-algorithm through the state space of possibility.

## Art
The self is a path worn into the world. Will is the foot that deepens it. Freedom is the eye that lifts to see the mountain.
