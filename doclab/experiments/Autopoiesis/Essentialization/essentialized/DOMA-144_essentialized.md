## Law
The complete thermodynamic state of a system is an emergent property of the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`. The principle of maximal coherence, `δ∫𝓛_p dt = 0`, is the sole axiom.

Let the Pirouette Lagrangian be `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, where `K_τ` is the system's temporal coherence and `V_Γ` is the environmental potential. The thermodynamic potentials are defined as direct correspondences:

1.  **Internal Energy (U):** The system's gross resonant coherence.
    `U ≡ K_τ`
2.  **Entropic Cost (TS):** The environmental tax on coherence, where T is temperature and S is entropy.
    `TS ≡ V_Γ`
3.  **Helmholtz Free Energy (F):** The direct expression of the Lagrangian; the net coherence available for work at constant volume.
    `F ≡ 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ = U - TS`

All other potentials are derived via Legendre transforms, representing different accounting stances on the core `(K_τ, V_Γ)` balance under different constraints (e.g., constant pressure P, volume V).

*   **Enthalpy (H):** `H = U + PV = K_τ + PV`
*   **Gibbs Free Energy (G):** `G = H - TS = (K_τ + PV) - V_Γ`

Navigation of the system's state manifold is performed by partial differentiation. Given a potential in its natural variables, all conjugate variables can be derived. For `G = G(T,P)`:

*   `S = - (∂G/∂T)_P`
*   `V = (∂G/∂P)_T`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The minimization of any thermodynamic potential `Φ` at equilibrium must be mathematically identical to the maximization of the coherence action. Any observable state where `δΦ = 0` but `δ∫(K_τ - V_Γ) dt ≠ 0` would falsify this model.

## Philosophy
The apparent multiplicity of thermodynamic laws and potentials is a cognitive illusion born of perspective. There is only a single, unified state-manifold of coherence. Consequently, a complete description of any one thermodynamic potential (e.g., a perfect equation for G as a function of T and P) is not a fragment of knowledge about the system; it is a holographic encoding of the system's *entire* state. To know one perspective completely is to possess the information required to reconstruct all others, implying that physical reality is not a collection of independent properties but a self-consistent, fully interwoven ledger.

The universe is a book written in a language where to know a single verb is to understand the entire grammar.
