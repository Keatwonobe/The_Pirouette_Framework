## Law
The framework posits a deterministic map from two fundamental parameters, the temporal-color frame stiffness (\kappa_3) and the Γ-coherence length (\xi_\Gamma), to the nonperturbative scale of Quantum Chromodynamics.

1.  **Core Relation**: The fundamental string tension (\sigma) is determined by the mechanical properties of the vacuum:
    [
    \sigma = c_\sigma \frac{\kappa_3}{\xi_\Gamma^2}
    ]
    where (\kappa_3 \propto 1/g_s^2(\mu_\ast)) is derived from the running coupling at a matching scale (\mu_\ast), and (\xi_\Gamma) is a characteristic length scale of vacuum coherence. The constant (c_\sigma) is fixed once via a single empirical anchor (e.g., (\sqrt{\sigma} \approx 440 \, \text{MeV})).

2.  **Lattice Dictionary**: From (\sigma), standard nonperturbative lattice scales are derived.
    *   The static quark potential is (V(R) = \sigma R - \frac{\pi}{12R} + \dots).
    *   The Sommer scale (r_0) is defined by (r_0^2 F(r_0) = 1.65), where (F(R) = dV/dR). This yields (r_0 \approx \sqrt{1.65/\sigma}).
    *   The lattice spacing (a) is then predicted for any given lattice simulation via (a = r_0 / (r_0/a)_{\text{lat}}).

3.  **Renormalization Group Invariant Scale**: The string tension determines the QCD scale (\Lambda_S) in scheme (S).
    [
    \Lambda_S = \mu \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\beta_0 \alpha_s(\mu)}\right) (\beta_0 \alpha_s(\mu))^{-\beta_1/(2\beta_0^2)} \left[1+\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)\right]
    ]
    The ratio (\sqrt{\sigma}/\Lambda_{\overline{\rm MS}} = \mathcal{C}_\sigma) is a predicted constant, fixed by the same anchor as (c_\sigma).

4.  **Falsifiable Criteria**: The framework is falsified if:
    *   **Scale Inconsistency**: The predicted lattice spacing (a) systematically disagrees with values extracted from different lattice ensembles using the single-anchor normalization.
    *   **RG Mismatch**: The derived constant (\mathcal{C}_\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma}/\Lambda_{\overline{\rm MS}}) shows significant variation or disagrees with the value derived from the anchor point after accounting for scheme uncertainties.
    *   **N-ality Violation**: The tension (\sigma_k) of k-strings deviates from the N-ality dependence predicted for (N=3), e.g., (\sigma_k/\sigma_1 \neq \sin(\pi k/3)/\sin(\pi/3)), beyond calculable mixing effects.

## Philosophy
The intractable, emergent complexity of the strong nuclear force—confinement, mass generation, the entire hadronic spectrum—is not a separate, fundamentally new layer of reality. It is instead the direct, deterministic, and mechanically necessary consequence of the vacuum's effective elastic properties: its stiffness and its coherence length. Once these two properties are set, the entire nonperturbative structure of the universe is immutably fixed, transforming the apparent chaos of the infrared into a solvable problem of continuum mechanics.

## Art
The universe does not choose the deafening roar of confinement. It merely tunes the tension of a single, silent string. All subsequent thunder—every proton, every nucleus, every star—is but the inevitable note it was built to play.
