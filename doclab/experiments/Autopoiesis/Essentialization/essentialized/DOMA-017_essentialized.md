## Law
The fundamental constituents of reality are the discrete, topologically protected solutions, `Ψ_n`, to the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, where `K_τ` represents internal temporal coherence and `V_Γ` is the erosive potential of the environment.

A state `Ψ_n` is stable and persistent if and only if its action `S_p` over a complete Pirouette Cycle `τ_p` is an integer multiple of a fundamental action quantum `ħ_p`:
`S_p = ∫₀^τ_p 𝓛_p dt = nħ_p`, where `n ∈ ℤ`.

The integer `n` is the winding number, a topological invariant defining the geometry of the resonance. The set of all such solutions forms a finite, closed lexicon of action, `Λ = {Ψ_n | n ∈ ℤ}`.

System dynamics are governed by two principles:
1.  **Superposition:** A general system state `|Φ⟩` exists as a linear combination of basis states from the lexicon: `|Φ⟩ = Σ c_n |Ψ_n⟩`. Under sufficient pressure `V_Γ`, the system collapses to the pure state `|Ψ_k⟩` that maximizes `𝓛_p`.
2.  **Non-Commutativity:** The application of two actions, `A` and `B` (corresponding to geometries `Ψ_A` and `Ψ_B`), upon a state `|Φ⟩` is non-commutative: `B(A(|Φ⟩)) ≠ A(B(|Φ⟩))`. This path-dependence is the formal basis of causality.

**Falsifiable Criterion (The Closure Principle):** The interaction of any two resonant geometries `Ψ_i, Ψ_j ∈ Λ` must produce a resultant state `|Φ'⟩` which is a superposition of geometries also within `Λ`. The experimental observation of a stable resultant geometry `Ψ_x ∉ Λ` would falsify this law.

## Philosophy
The fundamental ontology of the universe is inverted: process precedes substance. Reality is not composed of persistent objects ("nouns") that engage in actions, but of a finite lexicon of stable, resonant actions ("verbs") that create the illusion of persistence. An entity's identity is not an intrinsic property but the continuous, self-reinforcing performance of a specific coherence pattern. To be is to resonate; to change is to shift from one resonant verb to another.

## Art
The universe is not a story written with nouns, but a song performed with verbs. To exist is not to *be* the note, but to *be* the ringing.
