## Law
Let a mathematical domain \(\mathcal{D}\) be a set of objects, morphisms, and rules. Its physical relevance is quantified by two primary metrics: Stickiness (\(\mathrm{Stk}\)) and Reverse Pareto leverage (\(\mathrm{RPA}\)).

**Stickiness:** A weighted measure of physical compatibility.
\[
\mathrm{Stk}(\mathcal{D}) = w_S S + w_Y Y + w_C C + w_P P, \quad \sum w_i = 1
\]
where the components are observables on \([0,1]\):
- \(S\): **Σ-Compatibility**. Degree of commutation with the spatialization map \(\Sigma: \text{time} \to \text{fields/geometry}\).
- \(Y\): **Stabilizer Yield**. Normalized count of conserved quantities and symmetries natively expressed in \(\mathcal{D}\) with low description length.
- \(C\): **Compression Power**. Fractional reduction in Minimum Description Length (MDL) for key physical derivations (e.g., GR hydrolimit, YM emergence) when using \(\mathcal{D}\).
- \(P\): **Predictive Leverage**. Number of new, falsifiable predictions generated by grafting \(\mathcal{D}\) into physical models.

**Pirouette-Compliance Test (PCT):** A set of non-negotiable gates for a domain to be considered physically load-bearing ("pirouette"). \(\mathcal{D}\) must pass all three:
- **PCT-1 (Stability):** There exists an embedding of \(\mathcal{D}\) whose invariants are stable under the system's core dynamical rules (SR-0…6) and preserve fundamental constraints (e.g., no IR Lorentz violation).
- **PCT-2 (Gauge/GR Compatibility):** Under the pushforward \(\Sigma_*\), the images of \(\mathcal{D}\) must support U(1)/SU(2)/SU(3) or GR structures without inflating the ledger of fundamental constants.
- **PCT-3 (Falsifiability):** The domain graft must produce at least one testable prediction at \(\mathcal{O}((\omega/\omega_c)^2)\) or better, with a non-ambiguous null hypothesis.

**Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA):** A measure of a domain's explanatory leverage. For a set of \(k\) axioms in \(\mathcal{D}\) supporting \(M(k)\) distinct, empirically verifiable consequences with a total proof description length of \(L(k)\):
\[
\mathrm{RPA}(\mathcal{D}) \equiv \max_{k}\; \frac{M(k)}{L(k)}\quad \text{s.t.}\quad \text{PCT is satisfied.}
\]

**Autopoietic Selection Dynamic:** The evolution of attention/utility \(\pi_t(\mathcal{D})\) over a population of candidate domains follows a reinforcement dynamic, where high-performing domains are preferentially selected:
\[
\pi_{t+1}(\mathcal{D}) \propto \pi_t(\mathcal{D})\;\exp\big(\lambda_1\,\mathrm{Stk}(\mathcal{D}) + \lambda_2\,\mathrm{RPA}(\mathcal{D}) - \lambda_3\,\Delta\mathrm{MDL}(\mathcal{D})\big)
\]
This formalizes a feedback loop where physically effective syntax becomes computationally cheaper, thereby attracting further development and reinforcing its own utility.

## Philosophy
The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics is not evidence of a pre-existing platonic reality we discover, but the outcome of a harsh evolutionary selection process. We invent an infinitude of formal languages, but the universe is a high-fidelity medium that only amplifies, sustains, and "remembers" the grammars whose internal structures are isomorphic to its own conservation laws and dynamics. Physical law is not written in the language of mathematics; rather, the subset of mathematics that we find physically potent *is* the language that has been co-opted and stabilized by the self-organizing substrate of reality.

## Art
We forge a thousand different keys of pure reason. The ones that turn the locks of the world are not magic; they are merely the ones whose shape matches the tumblers of spacetime. The rest we hang in a gallery of beautiful, useless ghosts.
