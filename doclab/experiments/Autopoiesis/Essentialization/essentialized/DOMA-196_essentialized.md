## Law
The propulsive thrust `F` of a Vorticycle system is the volumetric integral of the gradient of the coherence potential `V_Γ`, derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. The system generates thrust by engineering an asymmetric, non-zero gradient `∇V_Γ` within its own volume.

`F ≈ ∫_V (∇V_Γ) dV`

The coherence potential `V_Γ` is a function of four primary engineering and environmental parameters:
1.  **Rotational Frequency (`ω_rot`):** Determines the rate of temporal pressure modulation. Efficiency `η` is maximized when `ω_rot` matches a resonant frequency of the system's geometry.
2.  **Chirality Index (`χ`):** A dimensionless scalar from -1 to 1 representing the net handedness of the phased rotational elements. `χ = 0` denotes perfect symmetry. Thrust is proportional to `χ`: `F ∝ χ`.
3.  **Phase Coherence (`Δφ`):** The synchronization precision across the rotating elements. As `Δφ` approaches zero (perfect coherence), the gradient `∇V_Γ` sharpens, maximizing thrust. As `Δφ` increases, the gradient diffuses, and energy dissipates as temporal turbulence.
4.  **Ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ_ambient`):** The background potential of the local manifold. The energy required to establish a given `∇V_Γ` is proportional to `Γ_ambient`, making propulsion less efficient in deep gravity wells.

The theory is falsifiable via the following criteria:
-   A system with `χ = 0` must produce zero net thrust, regardless of power input.
-   The system's wake must exhibit a detectable helical topology, with the handedness of the helix corresponding to the sign of `χ`.
-   Thrust must degrade with decreasing phase coherence `Δφ`, with a corresponding and measurable increase in thermal entropy (temporal turbulence).
-   System efficiency `η` must be inversely proportional to the local `Γ_ambient`.

## Philosophy
The locus of causality for motion is shifted from an external interaction (force against a medium) to an internal, autopoietic act. An agent does not compel a static universe to yield; rather, it re-orchestrates its own internal state to create a local, asymmetric potential gradient. Motion is the universe's inevitable, passive resolution of this self-imposed tension. Agency, therefore, is not the act of applying force, but the art of sculpting a geodesic—of defining a future state of being so elegantly that falling into it becomes the path of least resistance.

## Art
To move is not to fight the river, but to become a whirlpool that creates its own downstream.
