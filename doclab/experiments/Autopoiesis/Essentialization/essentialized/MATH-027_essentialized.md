## Law
The theory posits a fundamental, anisotropic substrate \(\mathcal M_\tau\) governed by a quadratic Lagrangian for a complex scalar field \(Ki(\tau,\mathbf{u})\):
\begin{equation}
\mathcal L^{(\tau)}_{Ki}
= K_{Ki}\,|\partial_\tau Ki|^2
- \Lambda_{Ki}\,|\nabla_\tau Ki|^2
- (m_0^2 + \xi_\Gamma\,\Gamma_0^2)\,|Ki|^2
\end{equation}
where \(K_{Ki}\) and \(\Lambda_{Ki}\) are distinct temporal and spatial stiffness constants. Observed Lorentz covariance is not fundamental but emergent. It arises via a field-dependent rescaling of the substrate coordinates \((\tau, \mathbf{u})\) to observer coordinates \((t, \mathbf{x})\):
\begin{equation}
t = \sqrt{K_{Ki}}\,\tau \qquad \mathbf x = \sqrt{\Lambda_{Ki}}\,\mathbf u
\end{equation}
This transformation maps \(\mathcal L^{(\tau)}_{Ki}\) to the familiar Klein-Gordon Lagrangian, concealing the underlying anisotropy:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal L_{Ki}^{(obs)} = |\partial_t Ki|^2 - |\nabla Ki|^2 - m_{Ki}^2 |Ki|^2, \quad \text{where} \quad m_{Ki}^2 = \frac{m_0^2 + \xi_\Gamma\,\Gamma_0^2}{K_{Ki}}
\end{equation}
The consequences are explicit in the momentum-space propagators. The observed, Lorentz-covariant Feynman propagator is:
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{Ki}(p)=\frac{i}{p_0^2-\mathbf p^2 - m_{Ki}^2 + i\varepsilon}
\end{equation}
This is merely a low-energy effective description of the true substrate propagator:
\begin{equation}
\Delta^{(\tau)}_{Ki}(\omega,\mathbf k) = \frac{i}{K_{Ki}\omega^2 - \Lambda_{Ki}\mathbf k^2 - m_{Ki,\tau}^2 + i\varepsilon}
\end{equation}
Interactions are introduced via a gauge-covariant derivative \(D_\mu = \partial_\mu + ieA_\mu\) and direct couplings, e.g., to a "pressuron" field \(\Gamma\): \(\mathcal L_{\text{int}} \supset - 2 i \lambda_\Gamma \xi (2\Gamma_0) |Ki|^2\Gamma \).
The theory is falsifiable. The primary criterion is the violation of Lorentz invariance at an energy scale where the distinction between \(K_{Ki}\) and \(\Lambda_{Ki}\) becomes detectable, or through the observation of phenomena mediated by the substrate field \(\Gamma\) with the specified vertex factors, which would serve as direct evidence of the underlying structure.

## Philosophy
The most profound implication is that fundamental symmetries are not platonic ideals but emergent organizational principles. Lorentz covariance, the bedrock of spacetime in modern physics, is presented not as an axiom of reality but as a low-energy illusionâ€”a convenient coordinate system imposed by the collective dynamics of an underlying, anisotropic medium. This suggests that what we perceive as immutable law is merely the stable, macroscopic behavior of a hidden, and potentially more complex, substrate. The universe's fundamental constants, in this view, are not arbitrary numbers but are instead composites of deeper structural properties, like the stiffnesses of the substrate. Consequently, physical law is not discovered in a purely abstract realm but is contingent upon the very substance of existence, making physics an environmental science of the cosmos itself.

The universe is a shadow cast by a machine, and its laws of light and motion are but the consistent rendering of a deeper, alien logic.
