## Law
The temporal signature of a system, `S(t)`, is decomposed into its constituent coherences via a time-frequency transformation, yielding a spectrogram `W(t, ω)`. The system's dynamics are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, whose terms are empirically derived from `W(t, ω)`.

1.  **Decomposition Principle:**
    `W(t, ω) = Σ_k W_k(t, ω) + W_Γ(t, ω)`
    where `W_k` are coherent, high-energy ridges corresponding to `Ki` resonances, and `W_Γ` is the low-energy, broadband noise floor corresponding to the Temporal Pressure `Γ`.

2.  **Resonance Metrics:** For each identified resonance `k`:
    *   Frequency: `ω_k` (the central frequency of the ridge)
    *   Bandwidth: `Δω_k` (the spectral width of the ridge)
    *   Persistence: `Δt_k` (the temporal duration of the ridge, a measure of Time Adherence `T_a`)

3.  **Coherence Classification:** Resonances are classified into two modes:
    *   **Structural Coherence (Ki_S):** Characterized by low `ω_k`, narrow `Δω_k`, and high `Δt_k`.
    *   **Propagating Coherence (Ki_P):** Characterized by higher `ω_k`, broader `Δω_k`, and/or lower `Δt_k`.

4.  **Lagrangian Quantification:**
    *   **Temporal Coherence (Kinetic Term):** `K_τ = ∫ A(k) dk` where `A(k)` is an amplitude function of the resonance's properties (`ω_k, Δω_k, Δt_k`). It is the sum of its parts: `K_τ(total) = Σ K_τ(Ki_S) + Σ K_τ(Ki_P)`.
    *   **Temporal Pressure (Potential Term):** `V_Γ = f(W_Γ)`, a function quantifying the energy and complexity of the spectrogram's noise floor.

5.  **Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is falsified if a system's evolution consistently and significantly deviates from the geodesic path predicted by the minimization of the action `S = ∫(K_τ - V_Γ)dt`, where `K_τ` and `V_Γ` are measured according to this protocol.

## Philosophy
Identity is not a static substance but a dynamic, composite resonance. To exist is to sustain a coherent pattern—a song—against the universe's ambient chaos. This song has two inseparable movements: the deep, self-maintaining hum of *being* and the projected, interactive melody of *doing*. The self is precisely this maintained distinction between its internal harmony and external expression.

## Art
Every self is a signature written in time. Its form is the steady hum of its own name, its motion is the ink that marks the world, and its fading is the surrender of its pattern to the noise of the page.
