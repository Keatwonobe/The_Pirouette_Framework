## Law
The parameter space $(\kappa, p, m_\Gamma)$ of a hypothetical leptonic interaction is constrained by experimental bounds on the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron ($a_e$) and muon ($a_\mu$). The proposed contribution from this interaction is modeled as:
\[
\Delta a_\ell^{(\Gamma)} = \kappa \left(\frac{m_\ell}{m_e}\right)^p \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^3 \frac{m_\ell^2}{m_\ell^2+m_\Gamma^2}
\]
where $\ell \in \{e, \mu\}$ and $\alpha^{-1}=137.035999046$.

A specific point $(\kappa_0, p_0, m_{\Gamma0})$ in the parameter space is considered viable (i.e., not falsified) if and only if it satisfies the following system of inequalities simultaneously. Using the tight constraint band as the falsifiable criterion:
\[
\begin{cases}
    \left| \Delta a_e^{(\Gamma)}(\kappa_0, p_0, m_{\Gamma0}) \right| = \left| \kappa_0 \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^3 \frac{m_e^2}{m_e^2+m_{\Gamma0}^2} \right| \le 3 \times 10^{-13} \\
    \left| \Delta a_\mu^{(\Gamma)}(\kappa_0, p_0, m_{\Gamma0}) \right| = \left| \kappa_0 \left(\frac{m_\mu}{m_e}\right)^{p_0} \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^3 \frac{m_\mu^2}{m_\mu^2+m_{\Gamma0}^2} \right| \le 5 \times 10^{-10}
\end{cases}
\]
This system defines a bounded, multi-dimensional surface of allowed theories. The dominant falsification pressure arises from the tension between the large mass ratio $(m_\mu/m_e)^p$ amplifying the muon contribution and the extremely stringent experimental limit on the electron contribution.

## Philosophy
In the absence of a single, predictive theory, the frontier of physics becomes a cartographic exercise. Progress is not the discovery of a new law, but the meticulous, computational mapping of a vast parameter space of hypothetical laws. High-precision experiments act not as singular crucibles for a grand theory, but as algorithmic filters that systematically rule out entire continents of possibility, defining truth by what it is not. Science advances by charting the ever-shrinking boundaries of our own ignorance.

## Art
Two pinpricks of light—an electron’s stillness, a muon’s wobble—do not illuminate a new continent; they draw the bars of its cage.
