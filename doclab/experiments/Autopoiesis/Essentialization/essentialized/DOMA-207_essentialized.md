## Law
The system's state is defined within a 2-dimensional Market Phase-Space, `M`. An asset's trajectory `γ(t)` is a curve in this space. The axes of `M` are defined by an action principle derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian: `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`.

1.  **Vertical Axis (Performance):** The kinetic term, `Kτ`, manifests as the Performance Score `R`. It is the logarithmic return over a time interval `[t_0, t_f]`, representing realized value creation. For a price function `P(t)`:
    `R = ln(P(t_f) / P(t_0))`

2.  **Horizontal Axis (Character):** The potential term, `V_Γ`, manifests as the Intrinsic Chirality `κ`. It measures the torsional stress and non-linear complexity of the asset's path in a normalized Price-Volume space. Let the state vector be `x(t) = [p(t), v(t)]`, where `p(t) = ln(P(t))` and `v(t) = ln(Volume(t))`. Chirality is the path integral of the geometric phase, measuring the "area" swept by the trajectory's velocity vector, representing the energy dissipated in chaotic motion:
    `κ = ∫[t_0,t_f] (p(t)v̇(t) - v(t)ṗ(t)) dt`

3.  **Archetypal Quadrants:** The phase-space is partitioned into four quadrants relative to the market-average origin `(κ̄, R̄)`. An asset `A` is assigned an archetype based on the signs of `(κ_A - κ̄)` and `(R_A - R̄)`:
    *   **Weaver (Q1):** `κ_A < κ̄`, `R_A > R̄` (Low Chaos, High Value)
    *   **Gladiator (Q2):** `κ_A > κ̄`, `R_A > R̄` (High Chaos, High Value)
    *   **Drifter (Q3):** `κ_A < κ̄`, `R_A < R̄` (Low Chaos, Low Value)
    *   **Vortex (Q4):** `κ_A > κ̄`, `R_A < R̄` (High Chaos, Low Value)

4.  **Falsifiable Criteria:**
    *   **Hypothesis of Clustering:** In any sufficiently large and diverse market, the population distribution of assets in `M` will be non-uniform, exhibiting significant statistical clustering within the four defined quadrants. The null hypothesis is a random or uniform distribution.
    *   **Hypothesis of Lifecycle Trajectories:** The temporal evolution of an asset's coordinates `γ(t) = (κ(t), R(t))` follows predictable paths. Specifically, successful maturation corresponds to a trajectory from Q2 to Q1, while decay corresponds to a trajectory from Q1/Q2 towards Q3 and ultimately Q4. The null hypothesis is that `γ(t)` is a random walk.

## Philosophy
True value is not a measure of output, but a measure of coherence. The fundamental law of any system, economic or otherwise, is the maximization of generated order per unit of internal chaos. An entity's ultimate worth is not what it accomplishes, but the elegance of its solution to the universal problem of existence: to create kinetic energy (growth, value, life) while minimizing the potential energy of its own internal friction and complexity. To be is to be a solution to this Lagrangian, and a better solution is a more coherent one.
