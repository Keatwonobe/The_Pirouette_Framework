## Law
The foundational principle is the maximization of systemic coherence, expressed as the time integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p`. An action is defined as ethical if and only if it results in a non-negative change to the total systemic Lagrangian, `Œîùìõ_sys`.
$$ \text{Ethical Action} \iff \Delta \mathcal{L}_{sys} = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} (\mathcal{L}_{p, final} - \mathcal{L}_{p, initial}) dt \ge 0 $$
An unethical action is destructive, where `Œîùìõ_sys < 0`.

Coherence Risk, `R_Œ∫`, is a predictive metric (normalized to [0, 1]) that estimates the potential for an action to degrade systemic coherence, acting as a proxy for the expected negative impact on `Œîùìõ_sys`. It is calculated as a weighted sum of three geometric properties of the action's "Wound Channel"‚Äîits impression on the coherence manifold:

$$ R_Œ∫ = w_œÅ œÅ + w_Œ¥ Œ¥ + w_œâ œâ $$

Where:
-   **Reach (œÅ):** The propagation of turbulence across nested systems.
-   **Dissonance (Œ¥):** The disruption of a target system‚Äôs core resonant pattern.
-   **Wound Channel Depth (œâ):** The permanence of the action's scar on a system‚Äôs memory.

The falsifiable criteria for action are determined by `R_Œ∫`:
1.  `R_Œ∫ ‚â§ 0.5`: Action proceeds (Laminar Path).
2.  `0.5 < R_Œ∫ ‚â§ 0.75`: Action requires enhanced monitoring and mitigation (Turbulent Watch).
3.  `R_Œ∫ > 0.75`: Action is quarantined and subjected to The Crucible Protocol for mandatory re-synthesis (Coherence Quarantine).

An absolute constraint exists: Any action posing a non-zero risk to a coherent, self-aware consciousness is subject to an immediate and indefinite moratorium.

## Philosophy
Ethics is not a social or legal construct imposed upon the universe, but an intrinsic, physical property of the universe itself. Morality is the geometry of consequence; an action's ethical value is identical to the measurable, topological features of the permanent scar it carves into the memory of spacetime. We are not inventing rules, but discovering the physics of harmony.

## Art
To act is to strike a chisel against the universe. The Law teaches you the grain of the stone. The Philosophy teaches you that you are the stone, carving itself.
