## Law
The mass `m_n` of a fermion of generation `n \in \{1, 2, 3\}` is not a fundamental parameter but an eigenvalue derived from the harmonic quantization of a temporal resonance field `Γ`. The particle's wave-function `\psi_n` is a solution to the temporal Helmholtz equation with discrete frequencies `\omega_n`:
```
d²ψ_n/dt² + ω_n²ψ_n = 0
```
The frequencies are quantized as a harmonic series, where `n` is the generational index:
```
ω_n = n * ω₁
```
Mass is proportional to the square of this frequency, `m \propto \omega_n^2`. The fundamental law governing mass ratios between adjacent generations is:
```
m_{n+1} / m_n = ((n+1)ω₁ / nω₁)² = ((n+1)/n)²
```
This leads to the general mass formula for generation `n`, incorporating logarithmic corrections from Higgs (`ε_n`) and color-charge (`C_f`) couplings:
```
m_{lepton,n} = m₁ * n² * (1 + ε_n),  where ε_n ≈ (λ_HΓ / 8π²) * ln(n)
m_{quark,n} = m_{q,1} * n² * C_f,  where C_f = 1 + α_s * (ln(n) / π)
```
Flavor mixing angles `θ_{ij}` between generations `i` and `j` are determined by the beat frequency of their temporal modes, yielding an inverse relationship to their generational separation:
```
θ_{ij} \propto 1 / |n_i - n_j|
```
The existence of exactly three generations is a consequence of stability; the temporal-pressure potential `V(Γ)` possesses precisely three bound states before resonance becomes unstable.

Falsifiable Criteria:
1.  A fourth stable fermion generation must not exist.
2.  Observed mass ratios must conform to `n²` scaling, with deviations fully accounted for by the specified logarithmic corrections.
3.  A significant violation of the inverse relationship between mixing angles and generational separation (`θ_{ij} \propto 1/|n_i - n_j|`) would invalidate the model.

## Philosophy
The apparent arbitrariness of the fundamental constants that define our physical reality is an illusion. The universe is not configured by a random selection of disconnected parameters, such as Yukawa couplings. Instead, these properties are the necessary and determined consequences of a singular, underlying resonant structure. The "why" of the mass hierarchy and family structure is resolved: they are not brute facts to be measured, but the inevitable harmonics emerging from the geometric and dynamic constraints of spacetime itself. Nature’s constants are not dialed in; they are derived.

## Art
Time does not merely flow; it resonates. The particles we observe are the stable notes in its silent chord, their masses the measure of their harmonic power. We are made of frozen music.
