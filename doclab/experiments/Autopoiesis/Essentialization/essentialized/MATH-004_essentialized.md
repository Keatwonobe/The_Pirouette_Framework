## Law
The existence of a stable, periodic Ki rhythm, φ*(t), with period τₚ, is proven by extremizing the Pirouette action functional J[φ] over the Sobolev space H¹_per([0, τₚ]).

The action is defined as:
J[φ] = ∫_0^{τ_p} L(φ, φ̇, Γ) dt = ∫_0^{τ_p} [ K_τ(φ, φ̇) − V(φ, Γ) ] dt

Assumptions for existence of a minimizer φ*:
1.  **Kinetic Term (K_τ):** K_τ(φ, φ̇) is C² and uniformly convex in φ̇ (e.g., K_τ = ½φ̇²).
2.  **Potential (V):** V(φ, Γ) is C², bounded below, and coercive, satisfying V(φ, Γ) ≥ c₁|φ|² − c₀ for some c₁ > 0.
3.  **Function Space:** Solutions φ are sought in H¹_per([0, τₚ]).

The direct method of the calculus of variations proves existence. The coercivity of J (from the growth condition on V) and its weak lower semicontinuity (from the convexity of K_τ in φ̇) guarantee the existence of a minimizer φ* in H¹_per. By elliptic regularity (bootstrap argument), if K_τ and V are C², the weak solution φ* is a classical C^∞ solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation:
d/dt (∂L/∂φ̇) - ∂L/∂φ = 0
This equation's solution with periodic boundary conditions φ*(0) = φ*(τₚ) constitutes the stable Ki rhythm.

The core falsifiable prediction relates the rhythm's period τₚ to the ambient Temporal Pressure Γ. This relationship is derived by applying the implicit function theorem to the periodicity condition. For a confining potential V where ∂_Γ∂_φ V > 0 along the orbit (pressure steepens the potential well), the period necessarily shortens as pressure increases:
dτₚ/dΓ < 0
A stable system must accelerate its internal rhythm in response to increased environmental complexity to maintain its autopoietic loop.

## Philosophy
Existence is not a static property but a dynamic, self-sustaining equilibrium. The mathematics proves that stable, periodic structure is not an accidental or emergent property of matter, but a necessary and inevitable solution to a universal variational principle. To be is to oscillate—to actively maintain a coherent rhythm against the constant pressure of decoherence. Being is an orbit, not a state.

## Art
A gyroscope, finding its hum in the void, does not merely exist; it *insists*. Stability is not stillness, but a song sung against the silence.
