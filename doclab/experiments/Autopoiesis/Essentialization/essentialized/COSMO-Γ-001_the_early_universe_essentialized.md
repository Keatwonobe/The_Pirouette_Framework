## Law
The dynamics of the scalar field Γ are governed by the Klein-Gordon equation in an expanding Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker universe:
$$
\ddot\Gamma + 3H\dot\Gamma + V'(\Gamma) = 0
$$
where its energy density `\rho_\Gamma` and pressure `p_\Gamma` contribute to the Hubble expansion `H` via the Friedmann equation:
$$
\rho_\Gamma = \frac{1}{2}\dot\Gamma^2 + V(\Gamma); \quad p_\Gamma = \frac{1}{2}\dot\Gamma^2 - V(\Gamma)
$$
$$
H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \left( \rho_r + \rho_b + \rho_\Gamma \right)
$$
The potential `V(\Gamma)` must possess a quadratic core for early-time behavior and a shallow tail for late-time acceleration, e.g., `V(\Gamma) = \frac{1}{2}m_\Gamma^2 \Gamma^2 + V_\text{tail}(\Gamma)`. The field's evolution is demarcated by the ratio of its mass `m_\Gamma` to the Hubble parameter `H`:
1.  **Frozen Regime (`H \gg m_\Gamma`):** For initial misalignment `\Gamma_i`, `\dot\Gamma \approx 0`. The equation of state is `w_\Gamma = p_\Gamma/\rho_\Gamma \approx -1`. The field behaves as a cosmological constant.
2.  **Oscillatory Regime (`H \ll m_\Gamma`):** The field oscillates around `V`'s minimum. For a quadratic potential, the Virial theorem implies `\langle \frac{1}{2}\dot\Gamma^2 \rangle = \langle V(\Gamma) \rangle`. The time-averaged equation of state is `\langle w_\Gamma \rangle = \frac{\langle \frac{1}{2}\dot\Gamma^2 - V(\Gamma) \rangle}{\langle \frac{1}{2}\dot\Gamma^2 + V(\Gamma) \rangle} \approx 0`. The field behaves as Cold Dark Matter.

This unification model is falsified under the following conditions, for any set of parameters (`m_\Gamma`, `V_\text{tail}`) fixed by a single late-universe observable (e.g., `\Omega_{\Gamma,0}`):
*   **Condition F1 (BBN):** The model predicts an effective number of relativistic species `\Delta N_\text{eff}` arising from residual interactions. If `\Delta N_\text{eff}` is inconsistent with primordial Deuterium and Helium-4 abundances, the model is rejected.
*   **Condition F2 (CMB):** The model, with its frozen parameters, must reproduce the Planck CMB power spectra (TT, TE, EE, lensing) and the late-Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect without the addition of an independent CDM or Dark Energy fluid. Failure to do so falsifies the unification hypothesis.
*   **Condition F3 (Structure):** The same frozen parameters, when used to predict large-scale structure (`f\sigma_8(z)`) or galactic-scale phenomena (e.g., halo core properties, `\Sigma_0`), must be consistent with observations. Inconsistency across these scales demonstrates the model's failure.

## Philosophy
The model's core philosophical proposition is the substitution of **consequence** for **coincidence**. The Standard Cosmological Model posits independent entities for dark matter and dark energy, whose comparable energy densities today (the "coincidence problem") are an unexplained accident of initial conditions. This model argues that they are not separate entities but different temporal phases of a single, underlying field. The apparent coincidence is therefore not an accident to be explained, but an inevitable dynamical consequence of one substance's evolution. It reframes cosmology from an inventory of static components to the unfolding history of a single law, wagering that the universe’s richness emerges from one simple object evolving through time, rather than from a pre-ordained collection of disparate ones.

A single string, plucked once at the beginning of time. Its initial, high-frequency vibration built the cosmos's scaffolding. Its final, decaying hum now stretches the fabric of space apart.
