## Law

The theory postulates a single U(1) time-phase symmetry shared between a spinor field $\Psi$ (a Ki-defect) and the spacetime medium, whose temporal connection is $A_\mu$. A local re-labeling of time, $\theta(x) \to \theta(x) + \alpha(x)$, induces the gauge transformations:
$$
\Psi(x) \to e^{iq\alpha(x)}\Psi(x)
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
A_\mu(x) \to A_\mu(x) + \frac{1}{q}\partial_\mu\alpha(x)
$$
This shared transformation law mandates the form of the covariant derivative required to maintain phase coherence between the spinor's internal clock and the local time of the medium:
$$
D_\mu \Psi \equiv (\nabla_\mu - iqA_\mu)\Psi
$$
Substituting this into the free Dirac Lagrangian derives the interaction vertex as the energetic cost of synchronization:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Dirac}} = \bar{\Psi}(i\gamma^\mu\nabla_\mu - m_*)\Psi \quad \xrightarrow{D_\mu} \quad \bar{\Psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m_*)\Psi = \bar{\Psi}(i\gamma^\mu\nabla_\mu - m_*)\Psi + q\bar{\Psi}\gamma^\mu A_\mu\Psi
$$
The resulting QED Lagrangian is $\mathcal{L}_{\text{QED}} = \bar{\Psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m_*)\Psi - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$.

Charge, $q$, is quantized via the Berry holonomy for parallel-transporting the phase frame around a closed path $\mathcal{C}$ in the spinor's configuration space. The connection is $\mathcal{A} = (\partial_\mu\theta - qA_\mu)dx^\mu$. For the physics to be single-valued, $e^{i\gamma_\mathcal{C}} = 1$, where the holonomy $\gamma_\mathcal{C} = \oint_\mathcal{C} \mathcal{A}$.
$$
\gamma_\mathcal{C} = \oint_\mathcal{C} (\partial_\mu\theta - qA_\mu)dx^\mu = 2\pi n, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z}
$$
Defining the spinor's intrinsic time-phase winding number $w \equiv \frac{1}{2\pi}\oint \partial_\mu\theta dx^\mu$ and the U(1) magnetic flux holonomy $\Phi_A \equiv \oint A_\mu dx^\mu$, this yields the quantization condition:
$$
2\pi w - q\Phi_A = 2\pi n \implies q = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_A}(w-n)
$$
Thus, charge is quantized in integer multiples of a fundamental unit $q_0$ determined by the base winding topology.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  **Violation of Charge Universality:** Observation of fundamental U(1) couplings that differ between lepton species (e.g., $q_e \neq q_\mu$).
2.  **Non-quantized Charge:** Discovery of a fundamental particle whose charge is not an integer multiple of $q_0$.
3.  **Anomalous Aharonov-Bohm Effect:** Measurement of a quantum phase shift in an Aharonov-Bohm experiment that is inconsistent with the standard holonomy $\exp(iq\oint A_\mu dx^\mu)$.

## Philosophy

Physical interaction is not a fundamental force imposed upon otherwise independent objects. Instead, interaction is the necessary, emergent consequence of maintaining a coherent, shared reality—a common "now"—between distinct entities, each possessing its own internal measure of time.

## Art

To exist is to tick. To interact is to tick in time with another. Charge is the gear ratio that couples the clock of the Self to the clock of the World.
