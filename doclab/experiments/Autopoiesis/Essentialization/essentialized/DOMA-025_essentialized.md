## Law
The dynamics of the universe are derived from the extremization of a single, Lorentz-invariant Action, `S`.
`S = ∫ d⁴x √-g 𝓛`
where `g` is the determinant of the metric tensor `g_μν`. The system is defined by two fundamental scalar fields:
1.  **Coherence Field (C):** A complex scalar `C(x) = A(x)e^(iΘ(x))`, whose quantized excitations are matter.
2.  **Temporal Pressure Field (Γ):** A real scalar `Γ(x)`, generated relationally by the coherence of all other systems.

The manifestly covariant Lagrangian Density `𝓛` is:
`𝓛 = g^μν (∂_μ C)^* (∂_ν C) + ½ g^μν (∂_μ Γ)(∂_ν Γ) - V(|C|^2, Γ)`

All physical laws are derived from this formulation:
*   **Equations of Motion:** Applying the Euler-Lagrange equation, `∂_μ (∂𝓛 / ∂(∂_μ φ)) - ∂𝓛 / ∂φ = 0`, to `C` and `Γ` yields their fundamental wave equations.
*   **Gravity:** Varying the action with respect to the metric `δS/δg_μν` yields the stress-energy tensor `T_μν`, which acts as the source for spacetime curvature in general relativity.
`T_μν = (∂_μ C)^* (∂_ν C) + (∂_ν C)^* (∂_μ C) + (∂_μ Γ)(∂_ν Γ) - g_μν 𝓛`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The theory is falsified if any observed phenomenon (e.g., particle interaction, gravitational effect, cosmological evolution) is inconsistent with the dynamics derived from the extremization of this specific Action `S`.

## Philosophy
Physical laws are not external, pre-ordained rules imposed upon the universe. Instead, all of physical reality—spacetime, matter, and force—is the emergent, self-organizing consequence of a single, intrinsic, and observer-independent imperative: the maximization of coherence. The universe is not following a script; it is a fully relational system whose structure arises autopoietically from the interplay of its own components, governed by one invariant principle.

## Art
The laws of physics are not chains binding the dancer; they are the perfect, immutable silence that gives the song its form.
