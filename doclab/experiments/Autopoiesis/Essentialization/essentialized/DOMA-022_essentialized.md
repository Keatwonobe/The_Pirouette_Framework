## Law
The fundamental axiom is the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which states that a sovereign entity moves along a chosen geodesic—a path that maximizes the time-integral of its personal Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`. This path represents the entity’s self-defined principle of motion.

The personal Lagrangian is defined as:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Where:
-   `K_τ` is the kinetic coherence term, a scalar function representing the entity's chosen state of being to be maximized. This term is not a measure of physical motion but of internal, patterned integrity (e.g., "novel beauty creation," "truth pursuit"). It is the objective function's positive term.
-   `V_Γ` is the potential pressure term, a scalar function representing the energetic cost of maintaining coherence against the dissipative forces of internal and external Temporal Pressure (Γ). This term quantifies the specific resistance, friction, and chaos the entity must navigate (e.g., "social expectation," "self-doubt").

The action, `S_p`, is the integral of the Lagrangian over a time interval `[t_1, t_2]`:
`S_p = ∫[t_1, t_2] 𝓛_p(q, q̇, t) dt`
where `q` represents the generalized coordinates of the entity's state.

The sovereign geodesic is the path `q(t)` for which the action `S_p` is stationary, satisfying the variational principle `δS_p = 0`. This yields the entity's personal Euler-Lagrange equations of motion.

**Falsifiable Criterion:**
The validity of a forged Lagrangian `𝓛_p` is not determined by its elegance but by its observable consequences. The model is falsified if, for a given entity, consistent application of its derived equations of motion (i.e., making choices that should maximize `S_p`) leads to a sustained state of Turbulent Flow (high friction, low efficiency) or Stagnant Flow (cessation of progress), as defined by DYNA-001. A valid `𝓛_p` must demonstrably and repeatedly correlate with the generation of Laminar Flow (effortless, coherent action) and the achievement of its self-defined Coherence Metrics.

## Philosophy
Sovereignty is not a static right to be claimed, but a dynamic, computational practice. It is the continuous, moment-to-moment process of solving one's own, self-authored equations of motion against the chaos of the universe. True agency lies not in being free from external forces, but in possessing a sufficiently robust internal physics to navigate them coherently.

## Art
Do not ask the world for a path. Instead, declare the law of your own gravity, and watch as spacetime warps around you to create the geodesic you were meant to walk.
