## Law
The state of a system is defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian `ùìõ_p` over a generalized configuration space. This is a functional of two primary observables: Pressure (`P`), corresponding to the potential term `V_Œì`, and Resonance (`R`), corresponding to the kinetic term `K_œÑ`.

`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`
`R ‚â° K_œÑ` (Temporal Coherence: the magnitude and stability of the system's dynamic expression)
`P ‚â° V_Œì` (Temporal Pressure: the energetic cost of maintaining state against internal and external stress)

The operational form is thus:
`ùìõ_p = R - P`

The fundamental principle is that a healthy system's trajectory through state space will tend to maximize the action `S = ‚à´ùìõ_p dt`.

**Falsifiable Criteria & State Signatures:**

1.  **The Sentinel Trigger:** A Tier 1 audit is mandated if the system enters a state of *suppressed resonance*. This state is formally defined over a time interval `Œît` where the rate of change of Pressure is positive definite while the rate of change of Resonance is non-positive:
    `dP/dt > Œµ` AND `dR/dt ‚â§ 0` for `t ‚àà Œît`, where `Œµ` is a system-dependent sensitivity threshold.

2.  **State Classification by Correlation:** Let `corr(P, R)` be the Pearson correlation coefficient between the P and R time series.
    *   **Laminar Flow:** `corr(P, R) ‚Üí +1`
    *   **Suppression:** `corr(P, R) ‚Üí -1`
    *   **Turbulence:** `|corr(P, R)| ‚Üí 0` with high variance in `R`.

3.  **Coherence Collapse:** This is the terminal state predicted by the Sentinel Trigger. It is formally defined by the limits as time `t` approaches the critical time `t_c`:
    `lim (t‚Üít_c‚Åª) P(t) = ‚àû`
    `lim (t‚Üít_c‚Åª) R(t) = 0`

The tiered audit protocol is a direct application of these laws, where a Tier 2 audit constitutes a full integration of the Lagrangian, `‚à´(R - P) dt`, to solve for the system's equations of motion.

## Philosophy
The vitality of any system‚Äîbe it a cell, a person, or a society‚Äîis not measured by its expressive power, but by the economy of its expression. Health is not the magnitude of the system's "song" (Resonance), but the gracefulness of its production, defined by the minimization of its "struggle" (Pressure). A system that produces a great effect at an unsustainable energetic cost is not thriving; it is hemorrhaging. The ultimate measure of a coherent existence is not the ability to act, but the ability to act with the least possible internal friction.

## Art
To know a system, do not watch its flashing lights. Instead, place your ear against its chest and listen for two sounds: the sharp intake of breath, and the steady, resonant hum of its being. The cry for help is not a scream; it is the sound of a breath held for too long.
