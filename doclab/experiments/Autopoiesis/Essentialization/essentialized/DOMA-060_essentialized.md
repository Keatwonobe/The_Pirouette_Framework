## Law
The Coherence Fracture is a non-geodesic phase transition from a state of Stagnant Flow (high `K_τ`, high `V_Γ`) to Turbulent Flow (low `K_τ`, low `V_Γ`), governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian: `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

1.  **Pre-Fracture State (Stagnant Flow):** A system develops a highly ordered but inflexible resonant pattern `Ki`, maximizing its local kinetic coherence `K_τ`. This rigidity prevents the dissipation of stress, leading to the relentless accumulation of Temporal Pressure Potential `V_Γ`. The system is in a state where:
    *   `d(K_τ)/dt ≈ 0` (structural stasis)
    *   `d(V_Γ)/dt > 0` (accumulating pressure)
    The system is trapped in a local maximum of `𝓛_p`, unable to follow a smooth geodesic to a more globally stable state due to the inelasticity of `Ki`.

2.  **Fracture Condition:** The fracture occurs when the accumulated potential exceeds the structural integrity of the containing pattern. Let `σ_Ki` be the tensile strength of the `Ki` pattern. The fracture is initiated when:
    *   `V_Γ ≥ σ_Ki`

3.  **Fracture Event (Phase Transition):** The failure of `Ki` is catastrophic and instantaneous. The stored potential energy `V_Γ` is violently converted into kinetic, dissonant energy, manifesting as a massive spike in temporal pressure `Γ`.
    *   `V_Γ(t_0) → Γ_spike` where `∫ Γ(t) dt ≈ V_Γ(t_0)`
    *   `K_τ → 0`
    This constitutes a non-geodesic leap across the coherence manifold to a high-entropy, low-coherence basin.

4.  **Falsifiable Criteria:**
    *   A system observed to have `d(V_Γ)/dt > 0` and an inflexible `Ki` must eventually fracture or find a non-fracture release mechanism. The absence of either falsifies the model.
    *   Catastrophic failure must be preceded by a period of high, constrained potential (`V_Γ`). Spontaneous failure from a low-pressure, flexible state is disallowed.
    *   Post-fracture, a system must enter a refractory period where `K_τ ≈ 0` and `V_Γ ≈ 0`, rendering it incapable of a subsequent fracture until a new coherent pattern `Ki` is established and pressure `V_Γ` re-accumulates.

## Philosophy
The highest form of stability is not permanence, but adaptability. Any system—physical, psychological, or social—that prioritizes the preservation of its current structure over its capacity to flow with the currents of change is actively engineering its own violent destruction. The universe does not permit stasis; it mistakes rigidity for a problem and corrects it with catastrophic force. True strength is not the ability to resist pressure, but the wisdom to yield to it.
