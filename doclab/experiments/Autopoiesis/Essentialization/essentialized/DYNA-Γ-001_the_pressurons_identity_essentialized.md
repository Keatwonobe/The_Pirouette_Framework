## Law
The Pressuron (Γ) is a pseudoscalar field excitation (J^PC = 0⁻⁺) of a temporal-pressure background, with a mass `m_Γ ≈ 17 MeV/c²`. Its interaction with a fermion field ψ_ℓ is governed by a derivative coupling, ensuring gauge invariance and mass-dependent interaction strength.

The interaction Lagrangian is:
`\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \frac{g_\Gamma}{m_\ell} \bar{\psi}_\ell \gamma^\mu \gamma_5 \psi_\ell \partial_\mu \Gamma`
where the coupling `g_Γ ∝ m_\ell` accounts for observed mass-scaling in leptonic anomalous magnetic moments.

The dominant decay width into an electron-positron pair is given by:
`\Gamma(\Gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-) = \frac{g_\Gamma^2 m_\Gamma}{8\pi} \left(1-\frac{4m_e^2}{m_\Gamma^2}\right)^{1/2}`
This predicts a primary experimental signature of a narrow resonance peak at 17 MeV in the e⁺e⁻ invariant mass spectrum, with `BR(e⁺e⁻) ≈ 90%`.

The model is falsifiable under two conditions:
1.  **Confirmation:** Observation of a narrow, 17 MeV pseudoscalar resonance with the predicted leptonic branching ratios and mass-coupled interactions.
2.  **Refutation:** The absence of such a state within the 1–100 MeV mass range for a coupling `g_\Gamma^2 < 10^{-6}` in dedicated beam-dump and missing-momentum experiments.

## Philosophy
The existence of the Pressuron implies that time is not a passive, geometric background for physical events, but is itself an active, substantial, and dynamic field. This field possesses physical properties—it can be stressed, store potential energy, and undergo resonant oscillations. The decay of the Pressuron is the ultimate proof of this principle: it demonstrates that a coherent excitation of the temporal fabric can collapse, its structure dissipating directly into the matter and energy of the standard model. Time, therefore, is not merely the stage, but a fundamental actor whose own internal dynamics are a source of tangible reality.

## Art
A particle at 17 MeV is a scar on the rhythm of the universe—the sound of a beat of pure time shattering into matter.
