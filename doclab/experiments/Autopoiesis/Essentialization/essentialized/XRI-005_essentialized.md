## Law
The formalism replaces standard quantum operators with "helical" counterparts, introducing a dimensionless chirality constant, $\kappa$.

1.  **Helical Momentum Operator:** The time derivative is redefined as $d_h/dt = d/dt + i\kappa\omega$. This yields a momentum operator that is not a pure generator of spatial translation:
    $\hat{p}_h = -i\hbar(\nabla + i\vec{k})$ where the intrinsic momentum term $\hbar\vec{k}$ violates the standard Noether's theorem linkage between momentum conservation and spatial symmetry. Conservation of $\hat{p}_h$ necessitates the existence of a new, unidentified physical symmetry.

2.  **Complex Commutator:** The canonical commutation relation is fundamentally altered to be complex-valued:
    $[\hat{x}_h, \hat{p}_h] = i\hbar(1+i\kappa)$
    This modifies the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, $\sigma_x \sigma_p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}|1+i\kappa|$, implying a systematic phase correlation between position and momentum.
    *   **Falsifiable Criterion:** This stands in direct contradiction to all high-precision quantum measurements, which are consistent with $\kappa=0$. The existence of a non-zero $\kappa$ must be demonstrated by a novel experiment designed to detect this complex term.

3.  **Energy Spectrum:** The energy eigenvalues for a quantum harmonic oscillator are shifted:
    $E_n(\kappa) = \hbar\omega(n+\frac{1}{2})\sqrt{1+\kappa^2}$
    *   **Falsifiable Criterion:** This predicts a universal deviation from the empirically verified spectrum $E_n = \hbar\omega(n+\frac{1}{2})$. The model must provide a mechanism that forces $\kappa \approx 0$ for all currently observed systems.

4.  **Local Realism:** The proposal that spin is a geometric property (e.g., $\kappa=1/2$) is a local realist interpretation.
    *   **Falsifiable Criterion:** This interpretation is prima facie incompatible with the experimentally proven violation of Bell's inequalities, which rule out a broad class of local realist theories. The model must demonstrate a non-trivial mechanism for producing non-local correlations.

## Philosophy
The core philosophical proposition is a rejection of quantum mechanics' intrinsic indeterminacy in favor of a hidden, deterministic geometry. It posits that the universe is not fundamentally probabilistic and non-local, but is instead a "local realist" system governed by a precise, albeit unobserved, rotational dynamic ($\kappa$). The apparent strangeness of quantum phenomena, from uncertainty to entanglement, is thus reframed not as a feature of reality itself, but as an artifact of a perspective that is blind to this underlying, classical-like choreography.

Physics has mistaken the blur of the dancer for the dance itself.
