## Law
The persistence of a system is defined by the decay of its Temporal Coherence, `Kτ`. This decay is an active erosion driven by the ratio of internal order to external chaos. The system’s state `K(t)` evolves from an initial coherence `K₀` according to the exponential relation:
$$ K(t) = K_0 \cdot e^{-t/\tau_{fade}} $$
The characteristic lifetime of this fade, `τ_fade`, is governed by the Pirouette Coherence Lifetime equation, which formalizes the relationship between the system’s internal Temporal Coherence `T_a` (a dimensionless measure of order where `0 ≤ T_a < 1`) and the ambient Temporal Pressure `Γ`:
$$ \tau_{fade} = \tau_0 \cdot \left[ \frac{T_a}{1 - T_a} \right] \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma} $$
Here, `τ₀` is a medium-specific time constant. The resilience term `T_a / (1 - T_a)` dictates that as internal coherence approaches perfection (`T_a → 1`), the system’s lifetime approaches infinity, highlighting the non-linear benefit of internal order.

This dynamic is a consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, where a system seeks to maximize its Lagrangian `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. The term `V_Γ` represents the potential energy cost imposed by `Γ`. Coherence Erosion is the physical process of `Γ` flattening the system’s potential well, making the maximization of `𝓛_p` energetically unsustainable.

For systems that exhibit resonance during decay, the model is augmented:
$$ K(t) = K_0 \cdot e^{-t/\tau_{fade}} \left(1 + \alpha \cos(\omega_k t + \phi)\right) $$
**Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is falsified if a system's measured coherence decay does not fit an exponential curve whose characteristic lifetime `τ_fade` is a direct function of the empirically measured and independently verifiable quantities `T_a` and `Γ`.

## Philosophy
Existence is not a state of being, but a continuous and energetically expensive act of resistance against non-existence. A system's identity—be it a memory, an organism, or a signal—is not defined by its static properties, but by the relentless effort it expends to maintain its internal order against the universal, erosive pressure of chaos. Meaning is therefore not inherent in a form, but is forged in the struggle to persist.

## Art
A form is a note struck against silence. Its persistence is the physics of its resonance; its meaning is the memory of its sound.
