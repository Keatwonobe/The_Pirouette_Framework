## Law
The influence `I` of an action, or Weaving, is formally defined as the change in the target system's Pirouette Action `S_p` over one of its characteristic cycles `τ_p`. The action `S_p` is the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, where `K_τ` is the system's internal kinetic coherence (its ability to maintain a resonant pattern) and `V_Γ` is the external temporal pressure it must work against.

`I = ΔS_p = ∫[0 to τ_p] (𝓛_p(post) - 𝓛_p(pre)) dt`

A Weaving is classified by the sign of `I`:
-   **Constructive (`I > 0`):** The action has increased the target system's net coherence, either by increasing `K_τ` or decreasing `V_Γ`. This is the formal definition of systemic healing.
-   **Destructive (`I < 0`):** The action has decreased the target system's net coherence, increasing internal dissonance or external pressure. This is the formal definition of systemic harm.

The direct measurement of `ΔS_p` is intractable. Its first-order, falsifiable approximation is the Coherence Impact (`CI`):

**`CI = (ΔKτ / ΔΓ_noise) ⋅ ξ_c ⋅ σ_s`**

-   `ΔKτ`: Net change in stable, resonant information within the target.
-   `ΔΓ_noise`: Entropy or systemic friction generated by the intervention.
-   `ξ_c ∈ [0,1]`: Resonance Coupling; the phase-alignment between the intervener's action and the target system's needs.
-   `σ_s ∈ [0,1]`: Stability Factor; the durability of the induced coherence state, a function of the depth of the resulting Wound Channel.

Falsifiable Criterion: An action cannot be deemed "constructive" if repeated, high-fidelity observations consistently yield `CI ≤ 0`.

## Philosophy
The single most profound implication is the reframing of ethics from a human-centric system of accounting to an objective principle of systemic physics. Morality is not a set of rules to be followed in pursuit of a score, but a diagnostic skill. A virtuous act is a physically therapeutic one: an intervention that measurably increases a system's coherence and ability to gracefully persist. The universe itself is the only true ledger—a physical medium where every action is irrevocably carved as a "Wound Channel" into the geometry of spacetime. Our moral frameworks are not the source of truth, but maps attempting to describe this indelible, physical record of consequence.

## Art
The universe is not a courthouse that judges your deeds, but a resonant medium that remembers your signature. A moral life is not the accumulation of points, but the act of choosing a vibration that strengthens the whole—a note whose echo is carved forever into the structure of what is.
