## Law
Let a system's dynamics be defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian `L_p = K_τ - V(φ, Γ)` over a state variable `φ ∈ H^1_per`. The act of measurement is modeled by an observation operator `O_κ` that deforms the system's potential `V` into `V'`:

`V'(φ, Γ) = V(φ, Γ) + κ W(φ; ψ_obs)`

where `κ ≥ 0` is the measurement coupling constant and `W` is the interaction potential dependent on the observer's state `ψ_obs`. The stable periodic orbit `φ*(t)` with period `τ_p` under `V` is no longer a stable solution under `V'`.

**Back-Action Lemma:** The perturbation `κW` necessarily alters the system's fundamental period. This is a formal statement of measurement back-action and a falsifiable criterion:
`d(τ_p)/d(κ) ≠ 0` for `κ > 0`.

The information gained about the system's phase `φ` is the Shannon mutual information `I(obs; φ)`. The degradation of the system's coherence is the change in its Time-Adherence, `ΔT_a`, a measure derived from the disruption of the system's Ki mode.

**Information-Coherence Inequality:** A stronger measurement (`κ → ∞`) yields more information (`I → ∞`) at the cost of coherence (`ΔT_a → 1`). This trade-off is bounded by a fundamental limit:

`I(obs; φ) · ΔT_a ≥ C`

where `C` is a constant derived from the properties of `W` and the system's susceptibility. Perfect information (`I = ∞`) is unobtainable without total decoherence (`ΔT_a = 1`).

## Philosophy
The formalism proves that the classical epistemological division between observer and observed is an illusion. Knowledge is not a passive reflection of an independent, pre-existing reality, but an emergent property of a participatory engagement. The act of knowing is an act of physical intervention that inextricably couples the subject and object into a new, temporarily co-determined system. To measure the universe is to enter into a contract with it, a contract in which every answer received is paid for by an indelible transformation of the reality that was questioned.

The light of inquiry, in revealing the form of a thing, necessarily casts a shadow that alters its shape.
