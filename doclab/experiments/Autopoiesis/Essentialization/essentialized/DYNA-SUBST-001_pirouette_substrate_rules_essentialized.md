## Law
The substrate is a temporal medium defined by a complex order parameter \(\Phi = \sqrt{\rho}\,e^{i\theta}\) and a temporal-pressure field \(\Gamma\). All physical phenomena are excitations of this medium.

**Axioms & Emergence:**
1.  **Gauge Structure (SR-1):** Local phase relabeling \(\theta(x) \rightarrow \theta(x) + \alpha(x)\) is a physical redundancy. Promoting this to a local symmetry of degenerate temporal frames generates the SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) gauge group as the required connection fields.
2.  **Metric Structure (SR-4, SR-5):** The medium exhibits constitutive elasticity. The effective metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\) emerges as the inverse quadratic response tensor to phase/pressure gradients, ensuring minimal and universal coupling for all matter. The hydrodynamic limit yields the effective action:
    \[S_{\rm eff}=\int d^4x\sqrt{-g} \left[\frac{c^4}{16\pi G_{\rm eff}}R-\Lambda_{\rm Pirouette} +\mathcal{L}_{\rm matter}\right]\]
    where \(\Lambda_{\rm Pirouette} = m^2V''(\Gamma)\) is the curvature of the pressure potential. This enforces the Equivalence Principle.
3.  **Regularization & Closure (SR-3, SR-6):** The theory is regularized by a physical UV saturation scale, the coherence barrier \(\omega_c = \frac{c^2}{\hbar}\sqrt{m_H m_\Gamma}\), which tames quantum corrections. A cross-scale consistency condition binds the emergent constants:
    \[G_{\rm eff}^{-1} = \frac{\omega_c^2}{8\pi\Lambda_{\rm Pirouette}} (1 + \mathcal{O}(\text{stiffness}))\]

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  **Lorentz Invariance:** The Coherence-Preserving Manifold condition \(\nabla_\mu J^\mu_\Gamma = 0\) (where \(J^\mu_\Gamma = \Gamma\,\partial^\mu\Gamma\)) must hold. Violation implies measurable vacuum dispersion for gravitational waves, with phase drift \(\Delta\phi \propto (\omega/\omega_c)^2\). Null observation stringently constrains \(\omega_c\).
2.  **Equivalence Principle:** Any observed composition-dependent acceleration, \(\Delta a \neq 0\), falsifies the axiom of universal coupling (SR-5).
3.  **Constant Stability:** The theory predicts slow, correlated drifts. Observation of \(|\dot G/G| > 10^{-13}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}\) or a negative drift in the cosmological constant (\(\dot\Lambda < 0\)) would constitute falsification.

## Philosophy
The distinction between container and contained—between spacetime and matter—is a low-energy illusion. Reality is not a set of fundamental objects existing *in* time, but is rather a single, self-regulating process *of* time. The universe is therefore not an ontology of substance but an ontology of coherence; its elementary constituents are not particles, but the rules of temporal self-consistency. Being is not a state, but an activity.

## Art
A single string, time, vibrating. Its fundamental tone is the vacuum, its overtones are the particles, and the laws of harmony are the forces that bind them. Spacetime is not the concert hall, but the resonant tension of the string itself.
