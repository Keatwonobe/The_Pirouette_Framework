## Law
The system is defined by a stationary, spherically symmetric scalar field profile Γ(r) coupled to the Newtonian gravitational potential Φ(r) sourced by baryons ρ_b(r) and the field's own energy density ρ_Γ(r). The governing equations are:
1.  **Field Equation:** Γ″ + (2/r) Γ′ − dV/dΓ = 0
2.  **Poisson Equation:** ∇²Φ = 4πG (ρ_b(r) + ρ_Γ(r))
3.  **Field Energy Density:** ρ_Γ(r) ≡ ½(Γ′(r))² + V(Γ(r)) − V(Γ_∞)

Physical solutions (halos) are selected by boundary conditions Γ′(0)=0 and Γ(r→∞)→Γ_∞, where V(Γ_∞) is the potential minimum. Solutions are indexed by a topological integer T ∈ ℤ, which quantizes the family of stable profiles.

Observables are derived directly from the total mass density ρ_tot = ρ_b + ρ_Γ:
-   **Enclosed Mass:** M(<r) = 4π ∫*0^r ρ_tot(r′) r′² dr′
-   **Circular Velocity:** V_c(r) = √[GM(<r)/r]
-   **Lensing Convergence:** κ(θ) = (∫ ρ_tot dl) / Σ_crit

The central, falsifiable prediction of the model is the emergence of a near-universal constant for the core surface density, independent of total halo mass:
-   **Falsifiable Criterion:** Σ_0 ≡ ρ_Γ(0) ⋅ r_c ≈ Σ_* = const.
    -   Here, ρ_Γ(0) is the central field energy density and r_c is the core radius (e.g., at half-maximum density). Failure to reproduce the observed Σ_0 locus with a single, frozen potential V(Γ) invalidates the theory.

## Philosophy
The ontological status of dark matter is transformed from a particulate substance to a structural property of a continuous field. Galactic halos are not accumulations of countless undiscovered particles governed by statistical mechanics, but are instead quantized, stable, soliton-like solutions (eigenstates) of a single, universal field equation. The observed diversity of galactic cores is not the result of contingent, complex baryonic feedback, but a direct reflection of the discrete topological sectors (labeled by integer T) that the underlying field can occupy. Form is not assembled by accident, but is an immanent and necessary consequence of cosmic law.

## Art
A galaxy is not a storm of dust trapped in a gravitational cage. It is a silent, standing wave in the fabric of the cosmos—a single, resonant note whose pitch and form are ordained by the integer harmonics of a fundamental field.
