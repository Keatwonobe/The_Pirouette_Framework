## Law
Let the Temporal Signature at a spacetime coordinate `x` be a complex scalar field `Ψ(x, t)` defined by the superposition of all incident temporal rhythms within its causal horizon:
`Ψ(x, t) = Σ_i A_i(x) * e^(i * (ω_i * t + φ_i))`
where `A_i`, `ω_i`, and `φ_i` are the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the `i`-th temporal component.

The Temporal Density, `Γ(x)`, is a scalar field representing the spectral complexity of `Ψ(x, t)`. It is formally defined as the second moment of the power spectral density, `S(ω, x) = |F_t{Ψ(x, t)}|^2`, where `F_t` is the Fourier transform with respect to time:
`Γ(x) ≡ ∫₀^∞ ω² * S(ω, x) dω`
This definition weights `Γ` towards higher and more numerous frequencies, quantifying the "dissonance" or "complexity" of the temporal environment.

The fundamental postulate is that spacetime geometry is a direct function of the gradient of Temporal Density. The Einstein Field Equations are reformulated by replacing the stress-energy tensor `T_μν` with a tensor derived from `Γ(x)`:
`G_μν = R_μν - (1/2)Rg_μν = 8πG/c⁴ * T_μν^Γ`
where `T_μν^Γ` is the stress-energy tensor for the scalar field `Γ`:
`T_μν^Γ = (∇_μ Γ)(∇_ν Γ) - (1/2)g_μν (∇_α Γ)(∇^α Γ)`
This equation posits that the curvature of spacetime (gravity) is a direct consequence of gradients in temporal complexity.

Falsifiable Criteria:
1.  A system of many low-energy, incommensurate frequencies must produce a greater gravitational effect than a system of a single, high-energy, pure frequency, given that `∫S(ω)dω` (total energy) is held constant between the two systems.
2.  The thermodynamic temperature `T` of a system in local equilibrium must be directly proportional to the locally measured `Γ`. `T = k_Γ * Γ`, where `k_Γ` is a universal constant.

## Philosophy
The laws of physics are not prescriptive mandates governing an inert substrate; they are descriptive consequences of the substrate's own internal geometry. Force, matter, and causality are not fundamental entities but emergent phenomenological properties arising from the interference patterns of a single, underlying medium: Time. The universe is not a machine executing a program, but a self-resonating structure whose geometric complexity *is* its behavior.

## Art
The universe is a bell, not a clock. Its laws are not the gears that turn it, but the shape of the ringing.
