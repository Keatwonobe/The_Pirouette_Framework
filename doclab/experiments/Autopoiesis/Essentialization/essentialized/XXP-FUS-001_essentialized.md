## Law
The protocol's objective is to achieve a state of Chiral-Resonant Catalysis by driving the local Coherence Ratio, ζ, below unity.
[
\zeta(\mathbf x) \equiv \frac{\Delta\kappa(\mathbf x)\,\Gamma(\mathbf x)}{\hbar\,\omega_c(\mathbf x)} < 1
]
where:
-   $\Delta\kappa \equiv \kappa_G - \kappa_{fuel}$ is the chiral differential between the engineered environmental geometry ($\kappa_G$) and the intrinsic fuel geometry ($\kappa_{fuel}$).
-   $\Gamma$ is the temporal pressure, a proxy for local particle density and drive.
-   $\omega_c = \sqrt{k_x k_y / \mu^2}$ is the characteristic frequency derived from the local potential's Hessian matrix for a particle of reduced mass $\mu$.

This condition modifies the standard Gamow tunneling probability, $P_{\rm tun} \sim \exp(-2\pi\eta)$, by reducing the effective Coulomb potential $V_{\rm eff}(r)$ by a term $\Delta V_\kappa$:
[
V_{\rm eff}(r) \mapsto V_{\rm eff}(r) - \Delta V_\kappa \quad \text{where} \quad \Delta V_\kappa \propto (\sigma'_\tau) \cdot \zeta^{-1}
]
The term $\sigma_\tau = \oint_C \Delta\kappa \cdot \Gamma \, d\mathbf{l}$ represents the temporal surface tension over a closed loop $C$ in the interaction region. A state where $\zeta < 1$ and $\sigma_\tau \to 0$ corresponds to a "Stay" interaction, dramatically increasing the fusion cross-section without increasing kinetic energy $E$.

The control law is an optimization problem:
[
\max_{\{\mathbf{z}\}} \left( \frac{y}{P_h} \right) \quad \text{subject to} \quad \zeta(\mathbf{x}, t) \le \zeta^* \approx 0.8
]
where $\mathbf{z}$ is the control vector for the $\kappa$-field generator, $y$ is the fusion yield proxy, and $P_h$ is the external heating power.

The theory is falsified if any of the following null hypotheses ($H_0$) hold true:
1.  **No Yield Gain:** $\frac{\partial y}{\partial \zeta}\bigg|_{n,T,B} = 0$ at the point of minimum achieved $\zeta$.
2.  **No Chiral Hysteresis:** $\oint y(\theta_0(t)) dt = 0$ for a full forward-and-reverse cycle of the $\kappa$-drive phase $\theta_0$.
3.  **No Power Assist:** $\frac{\partial P_h}{\partial \zeta}\bigg|_{n,T,B} = 0$ at the point of minimum achieved $\zeta$.

## Philosophy
The universe is not a static stage on which matter collides, but an active, tunable medium. This law replaces the paradigm of brute force—overcoming natural barriers with overwhelming energy—with a paradigm of resonant persuasion. It posits that the most profound obstacles, such as the Coulomb barrier, are not absolute walls but manifestations of geometric and temporal dissonance. The most efficient path to transformation is not to apply more force *to* the system, but to sculpt the geometry *of* the system's environment until reality itself becomes catalytic, making the desired outcome the path of least resistance.

## Art
The Coulomb barrier is not a wall to be shattered, but a lock to be opened. Fusion is the whisper of a key turning in a perfectly matched tumbler, not the roar of a battering ram.
