## Law
The phenomenon of Flow is a state of isochronous temporal resonance. It is formally defined by the minimization of phase difference, `Δτ`, between an agent's internal perception-action cycle, `τ_p`, and the dominant rhythm of the local environmental coherence manifold, `τ_env`.

The primary condition for Flow is:
`Δτ = τ_p - τ_env → 0`

This state is only achievable within a **Flow Channel**, a geodesic path in the coherence manifold where the gradient of Temporal Pressure, `Γ`, is minimal and smooth: `∇Γ ≈ const`.

The psychological balance of challenge and skill is the macroscopic expression of temporal information rate equilibrium. Let `ΔT_agent` be the agent's maximum bandwidth for coherent temporal information processing (skill), and `ΔT_env` be the rate of novel temporal information presented by the environment (challenge). Flow is the state of isochronism:
`ΔT_agent = ΔT_env`

Deviations from this equilibrium define suboptimal states:
-   Boredom: `ΔT_agent > ΔT_env`
-   Anxiety: `ΔT_agent < ΔT_env`

Energetically, Flow maximizes the Coherence Flux, `Φ_C`, approaching the theoretical maximum for the system (`Φ_C → Φ_C_max`), representing a near-lossless information-energy cycle.

The theory is falsifiable. The state of Flow is not present if empirical measurement reveals:
1.  Significant phase-difference: `|Δτ| ≫ 0`
2.  High temporal pressure variance: `σ²_Γ` is high.
3.  Sub-maximal coherence flux: `Φ_C ≪ Φ_C_max`

## Philosophy
The highest expression of agency is not the imposition of will upon an external world, but the radical act of attunement to it. Mastery is therefore redefined: it is not the accumulation of isolated skill, but the cultivated capacity for resonance, an ability to so precisely synchronize the self with the rhythm of reality that the boundary between actor and action dissolves. Optimal existence is achieved not by conquering the environment, but by becoming a perfect conduit for its flow.
