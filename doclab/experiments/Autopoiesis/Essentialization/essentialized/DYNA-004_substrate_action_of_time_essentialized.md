## Law
The fundamental dynamics are described by a substrate action defined over a pre-spatial temporal parameter `τ`:
`S_time = ∫ dτ [ K_τ(Ki, T_a) − V_Γ(Γ) − W_int(Ki, Γ) ]`

The components of the action are:
1.  **Kinetic (Coherence) Term:** `K_τ = T_a · ω(Ki)`, where `Ki` is the coherence motif field, `T_a` is the coherence quality, and `ω(Ki)` is a functional of `Ki`'s temporal variation.
2.  **Potential (Pressure) Term:** `V_Γ = f(Γ)`, where `Γ` is the temporal density functional. The cost function `f` must be monotonically increasing and convex (`f′ > 0`, `f″ ≥ 0`).
3.  **Interaction Term:** `W_int = λ · J(Ki) · Γ`, where `J(Ki)` measures the local expression or intensity of the coherence motif.

Spacetime is not fundamental but emerges as an effective description via a gauge choice `Σ`. Pushing `S_time` forward under `Σ` and expanding around high-coherence backgrounds yields a recognizable effective field theory in the Standard Model Coarse-Graining (SM-CG) limit:
`S_eff ≈ ∫ d^4x [ |(∂_{μ} − i q A_{μ}) Ki|^2 − m_eff^2 |Ki|^2 − (1/4) F_{μν} F^{μν}  + … ]`
where the gauge field `A_{μ}` is emergent and identified with `∂_{μ} arg(Ki)`.

Deviations from this limit are parameterized by a dimensionless substrate deviation scale `ε`. Setting `ε → 0` recovers established physics.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  A universal, non-zero decoherence floor must exist, scaling as `1/T2_min ∝ ε · var(Γ)`.
2.  Galactic rotation curves must be fit by a MOND-like acceleration term derived from baryonic matter alone, scaling as `a_MOND ∝ ε · ∇log Γ`.
3.  Analog systems exhibiting the phase topology of `Ki` must display two-cycle (720°) holonomy invariants.

## Philosophy
Spacetime is not the fundamental arena of reality, but an emergent, coarse-grained description of it. The apparently immutable laws of physics in `(x, y, z, t)` are the macroscopic consequence of a deeper, pre-geometric dynamics of coherence and pressure unfolding in time alone. What we perceive as distance, dimension, and locality are merely the stable patterns formed by the interplay of these more primary, non-spatial principles.

## Art
Reality is not a clockwork, but a song. Space is the shape of its resonance; matter is the echo of its beat.
