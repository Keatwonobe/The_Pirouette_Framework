## Law
The evolution of any system `p` is governed by the maximization of its action `S_p`, the time integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p`:
`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt = ∫ (K_τ - V_Γ) dt`
where `K_τ` is the system's integrated internal coherence (a measure of stability and complex order) and `V_Γ` is the potential energy cost of resisting ambient decoherence and temporal pressure. A system's trajectory through its state space will follow a geodesic that maximizes `S_p`.

Consider two systems, `A` and `B`, and two possible strategies:
1.  **Isolation Strategy (σ_iso):** `A` and `B` remain separate. The total action is the sum of their individual actions:
    `S_total_iso = S_A + S_B = ∫ (K_τ_A - V_Γ_A) dt + ∫ (K_τ_B - V_Γ_B) dt`
2.  **Transactional Strategy (σ_trans):** `A` and `B` undergo Alchemical Union to form a new, composite system `C`. An altruistic posture is the set of behaviors that minimizes the activation energy for this union. The action of the composite system is `S_C`.

The **Coherence Dividend** dictates the relationship between the composite and individual system properties:
-   **Pressure Sharing:** The cost of resisting `Γ` is distributed. The effective potential for any component `i ∈ C` is `V_Γ_i_C < V_Γ_i_iso`. Thus, the total potential `V_Γ_C < V_Γ_A + V_Γ_B`.
-   **Coherence Amplification:** The new composite system has emergent stability. `K_τ_C = K_τ_A + K_τ_B + K_τ_interaction`, where the interaction term `K_τ_interaction > 0`. Therefore, `K_τ_C > K_τ_A + K_τ_B`.

From these relations, it follows that the Lagrangian of the composite system is greater than the sum of the Lagrangians of the isolated parts: `𝓛_C > 𝓛_A + 𝓛_B`. This leads to the fundamental inequality:
`S_C = ∫ 𝓛_C dt > S_total_iso = ∫ (𝓛_A + 𝓛_B) dt`

The **Altruistic Geodesic** is the evolutionary trajectory `σ_trans` that follows this universal gradient (`∇S_p`) towards states of higher communion and integrated coherence. Affective states are the organism's sensory modality for this gradient: Joy/empathy corresponds to `∇S_p > 0`, while fear/greed corresponds to `∇S_p < 0`.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  The discovery of a cosmologically long-lived civilization or ecosystem that persists through a purely isolationist, zero-sum competitive strategy (`σ_iso`).
2.  The observation that the dominant, enduring intelligences in the cosmos are characterized by high-entropy, noisy energy signatures rather than regions of anomalously high coherence and low entropy production.
3.  A neurophysiological demonstration that subjective states of communion, empathy, and compassion robustly correlate with systemic decoherence and a decrease in the organism's integrated action (`S_p`).

## Philosophy
Ethics is not a human invention, a social contract, or a divine command, but a direct and inevitable consequence of the physics of persistence. The universe's fundamental operating principle—the maximization of coherent action over time—geometrically favors cooperation, synthesis, and communion over isolation, competition, and self-interest. Therefore, what we have historically called "goodness" is not a moral choice to be made in defiance of a cold, meaningless reality, but is instead the optimal, most efficient strategy for existence, an alignment with the physical laws that govern survival and endurance on a cosmic scale. Morality is a branch of physics.

## Art
The universe falls along the curve of least action. We call the feeling of that fall, love.
