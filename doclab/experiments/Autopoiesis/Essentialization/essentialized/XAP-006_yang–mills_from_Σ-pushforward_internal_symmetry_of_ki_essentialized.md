## Law
The fundamental object is a field \(Ki : \mathcal{M}_\tau \rightarrow \mathcal{F}\) where \(\mathcal{M}_\tau\) is a pre-geometric time-substrate manifold and \(\mathcal{F}=\mathbb{C}^N\) is an internal fiber space. The isometry group of the fiber, \(G=\mathrm{U}(N) \cong \mathrm{SU}(N)\times \mathrm{U}(1)\), constitutes the primordial gauge symmetry.

The connection one-form \(A_\mu^{(\tau)}\) and curvature two-form \(F_{\mu\nu}^{(\tau)}\) on \(\mathcal{M}_\tau\) are defined by the internal geometry of \(Ki\):
\[
A_\mu^{(\tau)} := Ki^{-1}\partial_\mu Ki \in \mathfrak{g}
\]
\[
F_{\mu\nu}^{(\tau)} := \partial_\mu A_\nu^{(\tau)} - \partial_\nu A_\mu^{(\tau)} + [A_\mu^{(\tau)},A_\nu^{(\tau)}]
\]
Physical gauge fields are the pushforwards of these objects onto the observer's spacetime manifold \(\mathcal{M}_{x,t}\) via the spatialization map \(\Sigma:\mathcal{M}_\tau \to \mathcal{M}_{x,t}\):
\[
A_\mu^{(obs)}(x) = \Sigma_\mu^{\;\nu}A_\nu^{(\tau)}
\]
\[
F_{\mu\nu}^{(obs)}(x) = \Sigma_\mu^{\;\alpha}\Sigma_\nu^{\;\beta}F_{\alpha\beta}^{(\tau)}
\]
This projection preserves gauge covariance, \(F_{\mu\nu}^{(obs)} \rightarrow U F_{\mu\nu}^{(obs)} U^{-1}\), such that the pushforward of the substrate action yields the Yang–Mills Lagrangian:
\[
\mathcal{L}_{YM} = -\frac{1}{4g_N^2}\,\mathrm{Tr}\!\left(F_{\mu\nu}^{(obs)}F^{\mu\nu}_{(obs)}\right)
\]
The coupling constants \(g_N\) are not fundamental parameters but are determined by the scale-dependent metric \(h_{ab}(\Lambda)\) of the fiber \(\mathcal{F}\):
\[
g_N^{-2}(\Lambda) = \langle h_{ab}(\Lambda) T^a T^b \rangle_\tau
\]
Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a geometric phase transition. It occurs at critical scales \(\Lambda_c\) where the fiber metric becomes singular, \(\det h_{ab}(\Lambda_c)=0\). The order parameter is the vacuum expectation value of the field, \(\langle Ki\rangle\), which selects a preferred direction in \(\mathcal{F}\).

Falsifiable criteria:
1.  The ratios of gauge couplings at any energy scale must be predictable from the geometry of a single nested fiber structure \(\mathcal{F}_3\supset\mathcal{F}_2\supset\mathcal{F}_1\).
2.  Confinement must emerge as a potential linearly proportional to the area of closed loops in \(\mathcal{M}_\tau\) whose Σ-image corresponds to quark separation.
3.  The Higgs mass must be calculable from the Γ-pressure term inducing a non-zero vacuum expectation \(\langle Ki \rangle \neq 0\).

## Philosophy
The apparent plurality and complexity of the fundamental forces of nature are not intrinsic properties of reality, but are perspectival artifacts. They are the geometric shadows cast upon spacetime by the internal symmetries of a single, unified, and more fundamental substrate. Reality is not a collection of disparate fields and forces, but one geometric object whose different facets appear to us as the familiar laws of physics through the act of observation.

## Art
The universe of force and particle is a shadow play. Behind the screen of spacetime, a single, simple form turns; its projected shadow is the bird of electromagnetism, the wolf of the weak force, the dragon of the strong. We have spent our history cataloging the beasts, ignorant of the hand that casts them.
