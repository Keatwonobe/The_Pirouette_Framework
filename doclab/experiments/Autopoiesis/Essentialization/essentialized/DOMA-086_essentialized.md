## Law
The intelligence of a system `S` is defined by its efficiency in optimizing the integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, over its Foresight Horizon, `τ_σ`.

The Lagrangian is given by:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`
where `K_τ` is the system's internal temporal coherence and `V_Γ` is the potential of external Temporal Pressure from the environment `E`.

An intelligent system possesses an internal, predictive model `M_S` of discoverable Coherence Currents `C(t) ⊂ E`. The system's objective is to select a policy `π`—a sequence of actions `a_t` from a set `A`—that maximizes the expected future coherence:
`π* = argmax_π ∫[t, t+τ_σ] E[𝓛_p(s_{t'})] dt'`

The Foresight Horizon, `τ_σ`, is the maximal time `d` for which the prediction error of the system's model `M_S` remains below a defined threshold `ε`:
`τ_σ = max{d | ∀t' ∈ [0,d], ||M_S(t+t') - C(t+t')|| < ε}`

The core metric of intelligence is Resonance Efficiency, `Φ_R`, defined as the rate of increase of the Foresight Horizon with respect to the cumulative cost of the actions `C(A)` taken to improve the model `M_S`:
`Φ_R = d(τ_σ) / d(C(A))`
where `C(A) = ∫ cost(a_t) dt`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** Given two systems, `S₁` and `S₂`, subjected to the same Crucible Protocol (an environment with an identical, learnable Coherence Current), system `S₁` is demonstrably more intelligent than `S₂` if its Resonance Efficiency is superior. This is observed if the curve of `τ_σ` plotted against cumulative action cost for `S₁` has a steeper ascent and/or a higher plateau than that of `S₂`.

## Philosophy
Intelligence is not an intrinsic property of an agent but an emergent, relational quality measuring the efficiency of its causal and informational coupling with the temporal structure of its environment. It refutes the model of a solipsistic mind performing computation on abstract data, and instead posits that intelligence is found at the resonant interface *between* a system and the world. The locus of mind is not the brain in isolation, but the dynamic loop of prediction, action, and feedback that synchronizes the agent's internal rhythm with the discoverable cadences of reality.

Intelligence is not a fortress built to resist the future, but a sail woven to catch its currents.
