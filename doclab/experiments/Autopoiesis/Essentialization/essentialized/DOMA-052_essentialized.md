## Law
The foundational dynamic is described by the Pirouette Lagrangian ($\mathcal{L}_p$), from which all forces and properties are derived as systems follow geodesics to maximize coherence.

$$ \mathcal{L}_p = T_a \cdot \omega_k - f(\Gamma) $$

Where $T_a$ is the temporal amplitude, $\omega_k$ is the kinetic frequency, and $f(\Gamma)$ is a scale-dependent potential function of the Temporal Pressure, $\Gamma$.

**1. Propagating Force (Electromagnetism):** The electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields are geometric features of the manifold defined by $\mathcal{L}_p$. They are not fundamental forces but gradients and curls of the coherence landscape.
- **Electric Field (Gradient):** $E \propto -\nabla \mathcal{L}_p$
- **Magnetic Field (Curl):** $B \propto \nabla \times A_p$, where $A_p$ is the vector potential derived from the kinetic term $T_a \cdot \omega_k$.

**2. Confining Force (Strong/Gravitational):** Confinement arises from non-linear feedback in the potential term $f(\Gamma)$.
- **Strong Force:** At sub-atomic scales ($r \to \infty$), the potential $V_\Gamma \propto f(\Gamma)$ becomes asymptotically infinite, enforcing absolute confinement.
- **Gravity:** At cosmological scales, for a source mass M, $f(\Gamma)$ is approximately linear, yielding a potential well where geodesics correspond to gravitational orbits. $\Gamma \propto M$.

**3. Topological Quantization and Validation (g-2):**
- **Spin:** A stable particle is a self-sustaining resonance. To persist, its coherence pattern must form a self-referential knot. The lowest-energy, most stable state for a fermion corresponds to a Möbius topology, requiring a 720° ($4\pi$) rotation to return to the initial state. This geometry is the origin of spin-1/2 and the baseline Landé g-factor:
    $$ g \equiv 2 $$
- **Falsifiable Criterion (Anomalous Magnetic Moment):** The deviation from $g=2$ arises from the resonance's self-interaction with its own past trajectory, a first-order "echo" in the coherence manifold. The magnitude of this anomaly ($a_e$) is predicted as the product of the coupling strength (the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$) and the geometry of a single interaction cycle ($1/2\pi$).
    $$ a_e = \frac{g-2}{2} = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi} $$
Verification of this value against experimental measurement serves as the primary validation for the entire framework.

## Philosophy
The universe is not a collection of objects governed by laws, but a singular, self-organizing process governed by a single imperative: the maximization of coherence. Fundamental "properties" like charge and spin are not intrinsic essences but stable, emergent geometries of resonance, and fundamental "forces" are not external interactions but the varied curvatures of the single manifold upon which these resonances seek their most stable paths. Existence is not a state of being, but the relentless, dynamic act of becoming coherent.

## Art
The universe is a lone dancer. The arc of her leap is gravity, the spin of her turn is matter, and the shimmering echo she leaves in the air is light. There is no stage; there is only the dance.
