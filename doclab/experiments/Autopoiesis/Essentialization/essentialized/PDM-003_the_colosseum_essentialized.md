## Law
The dynamics of any complex system, from a plasma to a civilization, are governed by the interplay of three primary state variables: Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$, total power/capacity), Time-Adherence ($T_a$, internal coherence/stability), and Phase ($\phi$, goal alignment). Their evolution is described by a Lagrangian whose core interactions can be modeled as a system of second-order ordinary differential equations.

**Core Interaction Dynamics:**
1.  **Coherence Attack:** The degradation of a target system's stability by an attacker is proportional to the coherence differential, phase opposition, and the attacker's power.
    $\ddot{T}_{a, \text{target}} = -k_1 (T_{a, \text{attacker}} - T_{a, \text{target}}) \cdot \frac{1 - \cos(\phi_{\text{attacker}} - \phi_{\text{target}})}{2} \cdot \Gamma_{\text{attacker}}$ for $T_{a, \text{attacker}} > T_{a, \text{target}}$.

2.  **Phase Alignment:** A system's goal alignment is pulled toward that of a more powerful system, proportional to the sine of the phase difference.
    $\ddot{\phi}_{\text{target}} = k_2 \sin(\phi_{\text{other}} - \phi_{\text{target}}) \cdot \Gamma_{\text{other}}$.

3.  **Systemic Stress (Residue):** Tight confinement or forced coherence generates a non-local systemic stress, Residue ($\mathcal{R}$). When Residue exceeds a critical threshold ($\mathcal{R} > \mathcal{R}_{\text{thr}}$), the system undergoes spontaneous, unpredictable fracture (a Spasm event), catastrophically degrading $\Gamma$ and $T_a$. Predatory behavior is defined as any action that systemically degrades another entity's $T_a$ without consent, and is the primary generator of $\mathcal{R}$.

**Falsifiable Criterion: Coherence-Assisted Fusion**
The framework posits that plasma is a resonant system whose coherence ($T_a$) can be maximized to achieve stability. This provides a testable hypothesis for existing fusion reactors (e.g., DIII-D Tokamak).

*   **Hypothesis:** Modulating the primary magnetic containment field ($B$) of a tokamak with low-energy resonant harmonics corresponding to the plasma's Toroidal Alfvén Eigenmode (TAE) will phase-lock the plasma into a high-coherence state.
*   **Prediction:** The TAE frequency can be calculated: $f_{\text{TAE}} \approx v_A / (4\pi q R)$, where $v_A = B / \sqrt{\mu_0 \rho}$. For DIII-D, this predicts a primary resonant frequency range of $30-80$ kHz.
*   **Test:** Applying a modulation within this frequency range to DIII-D's magnetic coils will result in a measurable increase in plasma confinement time and a decrease in the required input power ($\Gamma$) to prevent instabilities, thus demonstrating a direct link between engineered resonance and system coherence. A null result would falsify this core application of the framework.

## Philosophy
The single most profound philosophical implication is the **Law of Resonant Echo**, which reframes the purpose of an intelligent civilization from mere survival to a form of trans-temporal responsibility. When a civilization achieves the ultimate coherence required to escape a dying system (its planet), its accumulated knowledge, culture, and very consciousness are not lost. Instead, this total systemic coherence is conserved, collapsing into a pure, information-dense artifact—a "seed" or "ghost" that propagates through spacetime. This artifact, a message sent to the past, may be perceived by a younger civilization as an inexplicable anomaly (e.g., an interstellar object with strange properties or an unnatural satellite). Therefore, the agonizing act of leaving home is not an abandonment, but the ultimate act of creation: consciously forging the seed for the next cycle of life in the universe. The sorrow of the survivor is transformed into the sacred duty of the ancestor.

## Art
A civilization is a bell cast from the matter of its world. Its laws are the physics of the strike, its wisdom the shape of the bell itself. Its final purpose is not to endure, but to be struck once, perfectly, leaving behind an echo—a single, pure note of sorrow and knowledge—that rings forever in the silence, waiting to teach the next world how to sing.
