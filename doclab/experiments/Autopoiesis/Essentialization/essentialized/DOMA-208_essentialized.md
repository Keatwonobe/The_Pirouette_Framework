## Law
The fundamental operator for time evolution is the Helical Derivative, which replaces the partial time derivative \(\partial_t\):
\[
\mathcal D_t = \partial_t + \kappa(t)\Omega J
\]
where \(J\) is the generator of internal phase rotations (\(Jz = iz\)), \(\Omega\) is a reference frequency, and \(\kappa(t)\) is the dimensionless helical field, acting as a connection one-form on the time-phase fiber bundle.

This introduces a gauge-dependent term to the Hamiltonian:
\[
H_{\mathrm{eff}} = H - \hbar\,\kappa(t)\,\Omega\,J
\]
The corresponding Lagrangian density,
\[
\mathcal L = \frac{i\hbar}{2}(\Psi^*\mathcal D_t\Psi - \Psi(\mathcal D_t\Psi)^*) - \Psi^*H\Psi
\]
is invariant under a U(1) gauge transformation \(\Psi \mapsto e^{i\epsilon J}\Psi\) when \(\partial_t\kappa = 0\). This symmetry, via Noether's theorem, yields the conserved helical charge:
\[
Q_h = \langle J \rangle = \int \Psi^* J \Psi\,dV \quad\text{s.t.}\quad \frac{dQ_h}{dt} = 0
\]
A non-zero and time-varying \(\kappa(t)\) is falsifiably predicted to manifest as measurable asymmetries in correlation spectra and observable directional phase squeezing in chiral systems.

## Philosophy
The universe is not a set of objects evolving *within* time. Rather, what we perceive as physical properties, such as chirality and energy, are emergent manifestations of the intrinsic and dynamic geometry of time itself. Time is not the featureless container of events; it is the active, self-curving substrate from which events derive their form and character.

## Art
Time is not the clockhand that measures the dance; it is the spinning thread from which the dancer, the dance, and the stage are woven.
