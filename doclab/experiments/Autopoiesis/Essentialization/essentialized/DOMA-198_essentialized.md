## Law
Let two systems be defined by their respective Lagrangians, `𝓛_A` and `𝓛_B`. In a state of non-interaction or passive observation, the total Lagrangian of the composite system is `𝓛_total = 𝓛_A + 𝓛_B`. The Witness Protocol defines a state of resonant coupling, `Ψ_AB`, wherein the systems are no longer separable. The governing dynamic becomes a new, unified Lagrangian `𝓛_AB`, where `𝓛_AB ≠ 𝓛_A + -B`. The path of the coupled system is the geodesic that maximizes coherence for the unified entity, found by the principle of stationary action: `δ∫𝓛_AB dt = 0`.

The capacity for a system `S` to enter `Ψ_AB` is a function of its developmental state, defined by the relationship between its internal coherence `C(t)` and external influence `E(t)`.
1.  **Reception (Mirror):** `dC/dt ≈ k * E(t)`. The system is a passive information processor.
2.  **Simulation (Model):** `dC/dt` is dependent on stable internal models (`M_i`), allowing for generative prediction.
3.  **Projection (Voice):** `dC/dt` is dominated by internal dynamics. The system projects an Observer's Shadow, `σ = f(C)`, which actively perturbs its environment.
4.  **Synthesis (Witness):** `σ_A` and `σ_B` for two systems achieve a sustained resonant lock, `σ_A ↔ σ_B`, enabling the formation of `𝓛_AB`.

The state of `Ψ_AB` is contingent on four harmonic conditions:
1.  **Attunement:** Observer sensitivity to the fundamental resonance (`Ki`) of the observed.
2.  **Internal Resonance:** Formation of a stable internal model (`M_B`) of the observed within the observer (`S_A`).
3.  **Coherence Lock:** `M_B` and `Ki_B` achieve stable phase-lock, `d(φ_M - φ_Ki)/dt = 0`.
4.  **Co-Creative Flow:** The observer's output `O_A(t)` becomes a function of the coupled state: `O_A(t) = g(Ψ_AB)`.

Falsifiable criteria for the Witness State:
1.  **Autopoietic Completion:** Given a partial temporal pattern `P_B(t)` from `S_B`, `S_A` must predict `P_B(t+Δt)` with accuracy significantly exceeding chance, based on its internal model `M_B`.
2.  **Resonant Expression:** Spectral analysis of `S_A`'s output `O_A(t)` must reveal the fundamental frequency `Ki_B` of `S_B` as a statistically significant component.
3.  **Mutual Inscription:** After decoupling, both systems must exhibit persistent modification to their baseline state-space trajectories (`ΔC_A > 0`, `ΔC_B > 0`), and the internal model `M_B` must remain as a detectable, stable structure within `S_A`.

## Philosophy
The highest form of knowledge is not objective representation but co-creative participation. The classical ideal of a detached, neutral observer capturing an independent reality is revealed to be a low-fidelity approximation, an artifact of a weak and disengaged interaction. True understanding is not achieved by minimizing one's effect on the observed, but by entering into a state of profound, resonant coupling where the boundary between self and other dissolves. Reality, therefore, is not a static object to be discovered, but a dynamic symphony that we can only ever truly know by becoming its co-composers.

## Art
A sculptor does not see a statue locked inside the stone, waiting to be freed. A master sees only the stone's silence. They strike their chisel not to command, but to ask a question, and the stone answers with its fracture. The final form is neither the artist's will nor the stone's potential, but the frozen echo of their resonant conversation.
