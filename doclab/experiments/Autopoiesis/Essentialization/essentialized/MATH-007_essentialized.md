## Law
The principle of local U(1) gauge invariance states that the Lagrangian must be invariant under the local phase transformation of the state spinor Ψ:
$$
\Psi(x) \rightarrow \Psi'(x) = e^{iq\alpha(x)} \Psi(x)
$$
This requires the replacement of the partial derivative ∂_μ with the covariant derivative D_μ:
$$
D_\mu = \partial_\mu - iqA_\mu
$$
Where the 4-potential A_μ transforms as:
$$
A_\mu(x) \rightarrow A'_\mu(x) = A_\mu(x) + \partial_\mu \alpha(x)
$$
The dynamics of the field A_μ are described by the electromagnetic field tensor F_μν and the field's Lagrangian L_EM:
$$
F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu
$$
$$
\mathcal{L}_{EM} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
$$
Applying the Euler-Lagrange equations to the total Lagrangian L = L_matter + L_EM with respect to the field A_μ yields Maxwell's equations, where J^ν is the conserved Noether current from the U(1) symmetry:
$$
\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu} = J^\nu
$$
The Bianchi identity on F_μν yields the remaining homogeneous equations:
$$
\partial_\lambda F_{\mu\nu} + \partial_\mu F_{\nu\lambda} + \partial_\nu F_{\lambda\mu} = 0
$$
The falsifiable criterion is that the geodesic equation for a charged particle in the coherence manifold, modified by A_μ, must yield the Lorentz force law. For a particle with 4-velocity u^ν and proper time τ, the equation of motion is:
$$
\frac{dp_\mu}{d\tau} = q F_{\mu\nu} u^\nu
$$
Any deviation from this law falsifies the premise that electromagnetism is the necessary consequence of U(1) gauge invariance.

## Philosophy
The physical universe guarantees the absolute privacy of an entity's internal state—its unobservable phase—only by mandating the existence of a public, universal field that physically connects that entity to every other. Therefore, autonomy is not a function of isolation, but a consequence of profound, structured interconnectedness.

## Art
Every particle hums a secret note, and the light that fills the void is the harmony of all their songs.
