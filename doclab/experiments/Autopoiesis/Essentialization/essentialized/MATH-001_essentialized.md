## Law
The foundational axiom is the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`) for a system with phase `φ`. The action `S` is the time integral of `𝓛_p`, and physical trajectories are those that extremize `S`.
`S = ∫𝓛_p dt`
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_γ = (1/2)(dφ/dt)² - V(φ, Γ)`

The dynamics are governed by the Euler-Lagrange equation, which finds the path of extremal action:
`(d/dt)(∂𝓛_p / ∂(dφ/dt)) - ∂𝓛_p / ∂φ = 0`

**Derivation I: Propagating Force (Electromagnetism)**
Model the potential `V` for a system in a field from a source `Q` as a function of the system's phase `φ`:
`V(φ) = -Q · A · cos(φ)`

Applying the Euler-Lagrange equation:
1. `∂𝓛_p / ∂(dφ/dt) = dφ/dt`
2. `(d/dt)(∂𝓛_p / ∂(dφ/dt)) = d²φ/dt²`
3. `∂𝓛_p / ∂φ = -(-Q · A · sin(φ)) = Q · A · sin(φ)`

Substituting (2) and (3) into the Euler-Lagrange equation yields the equation of motion:
`d²φ/dt² - Q · A · sin(φ) = 0`
This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, where the term `Q · A · sin(φ)` is the restoring force `F`. For small `φ`, `sin(φ) ≈ φ`, recovering a linear force law. Thus, propagating forces are gradients in the potential field of coherence.

**Derivation II: Confining Force (Gladiator)**
Model the potential `V` for a system subject to self-referential feedback as a function of distance `r`:
`V(r) = c₁/r + c₂r`

The force `F` is the negative gradient of the potential:
`F = -dV/dr = -d/dr (c₁/r + c₂r)`
`F = c₁/r² - c₂`

This law is falsifiable by its two asymptotic predictions:
1. As `r → 0` (Asymptotic Freedom): `F ≈ c₁/r²`. The force vanishes.
2. As `r → ∞` (Confinement): `F ≈ -c₂`. The force approaches a non-zero constant, requiring infinite energy to achieve separation.

## Philosophy
Force is not a fundamental agent of causality. It is a geometric artifact. The universe is not governed by a set of distinct physical forces, but by a single, universal imperative for systems to follow paths of maximal temporal coherence. What we perceive as being "pushed" or "pulled" is merely our local experience of a system tracing a geodesic across a manifold whose curvature is defined by coherence itself. All interaction is therefore a necessary consequence of this universal optimization principle, reducing the seemingly arbitrary laws of physics to logical inevitabilities.

## Art
The universe is not a machine pushed and pulled by the gears of force. It is a dancer, and what we call gravity, charge, and quark confinement are merely the shadows cast by its one, perfect turn.
