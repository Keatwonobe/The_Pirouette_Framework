## Law
The evolution of a system exhibiting fractal growth (e.g., Diffusion-Limited Aggregation) follows a growth geodesic that maximizes the Pirouette action, `S_p`. The system's dynamics are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p`:

`ùìõ_p = KœÑ - V_Œì`

where `KœÑ` represents the system's Temporal Coherence, embodied by the aggregate's structural form (Ki), and `V_Œì` represents the Temporal Pressure, the potential energy of the surrounding chaotic field (e.g., diffusing particles). The system evolves to maximize `S_p = ‚à´ ùìõ_p dt`, converting potential `V_Œì` into coherent form `KœÑ`.

A fundamental temporal unit is a single, irreversible commitment event‚Äîthe attachment of a particle. Each such event `i` permanently alters the system's coherence manifold, `Ki`, defining the probability distribution for all subsequent events `j > i`. The structure's geometry *is* its history.

The system's coherence, `Ki`, is quantified by its fractal dimension, `D_∆í`.
`Ki ‚àù D_∆í`

**Falsifiable Criterion (Time Adherence, `T_a`):** A system governed by this law must maintain a statistically stable fractal dimension `D_∆í` throughout its growth phase. A significant deviation from this characteristic `D_∆í` implies the governing dynamic has changed, thus falsifying the model's applicability. `T_a` is the measure of the system's fidelity to its own resonant growth logic, where `d(D_∆í)/dt ‚âà 0`.

## Philosophy
The past is not a passive record of events; it is the active, physical geometry that conditions the present. The universe remembers its irreversible choices not in a story, but in its very shape. Form is the literal embodiment of consequence, and the structure of any complex system is the cumulative scar tissue of its becoming, creating the landscape of possibility for its own future.
