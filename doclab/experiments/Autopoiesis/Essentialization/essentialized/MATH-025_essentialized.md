## Law
The system's free energy is described by the Landau–Pirouette Functional (LPF) for an order parameter $\psi(\mathbf{x},t)$ representing phase coherence:
$\mathcal{F}[\psi] = \int \Big[ a(T_a - T_c) |\psi|^2 + \frac{b}{2}|\psi|^4 + c|\nabla \psi|^2 \Big] d^dx$

Here, $T_a$ is the control parameter (e.g., time adherence, cognitive load, social pressure) and $T_c$ is its critical threshold. Minimizing the functional ($\delta \mathcal{F}/\delta \psi = 0$) yields the governing dynamic, a complex Ginzburg–Landau equation:
$c\nabla^2 \psi - a(T_a - T_c)\psi - b|\psi|^2\psi = 0$

Near the critical point ($T_a \to T_c$), the system's behavior is governed by a universal set of Pirouette critical exponents, derived from mean-field theory:
*   Order parameter: $|\psi| \propto (T_c - T_a)^{\beta_P}$ with $\beta_P = 1/2$
*   Susceptibility: $\chi_P \propto |T_a - T_c|^{-\gamma_P}$ with $\gamma_P = 1$
*   Critical isotherm: $|\psi| \propto H^{1/\delta_P}$ with $\delta_P = 3$
*   Specific heat: $C_P \propto |T_a - T_c|^{-\alpha_P}$ with $\alpha_P = 0$ (discontinuity)

This universality class implies scale-invariant behavior. The coherence correlation length ($\xi_P$) and relaxation time ($\tau_P$) diverge at the critical point according to power laws:
*   $\xi_P \propto |T_a - T_c|^{-\nu_P}$ with $\nu_P = 1/2$
*   $\tau_P \propto \xi_P^{z_P}$ with $z_P = 2$

For coupled systems across domains (e.g., neural $\psi_1$, social $\psi_2$), the functional is extended:
$\mathcal{F}_{multi} = \sum_i \mathcal{F}[\psi_i] - \sum_{i<j} g_{ij}|\psi_i||\psi_j|\cos(\Phi_i - \Phi_j)$

Falsifiable Criteria: The theory is invalid if (1) measured exponents systematically deviate from the Pirouette universality class $(0, 1/2, 1, 3)$, (2) correlation length and relaxation time do not scale with the predicted powers, or (3) cross-domain couplings $g_{ij}$ fail to produce resonant conservation.

## Philosophy
The structure of systemic breakdown is substrate-independent. The mathematical laws governing how organized systems lose coherence—how they transition from order to disorder—are identical whether the system is composed of physical particles, neural circuits, or social agents. The collapse of consciousness, the onset of social unrest, and the demagnetization of a metal are not merely analogous; they are formally identical expressions of a single, universal principle of disintegration. This implies that the patterns of failure are more fundamental than the materials that fail.

## Art
Coherence is a crystal; stress reveals its universal cleavage planes, whether the crystal is forged from atoms, neurons, or nations.
