## Law
The gauge-invariant interaction between the Higgs field (H) and the temporal-pressure field (Γ) is described by the Lagrangian term:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \lambda_{H\Gamma} H^\dagger H \Gamma^2
$$
The dimensionless coupling constant, $\lambda_{H\Gamma}$, is determined by coherence boundary conditions at the electroweak scale:
$$
\lambda_{H\Gamma} \simeq \frac{g_\Gamma^2}{8\pi^2} \left(\frac{m_H}{m_\Gamma}\right)^2 e^{-\Gamma_0 / \Gamma_c}
$$
This interaction yields three primary, falsifiable predictions:

1.  **Total Width Correction:** An increase in the total Higgs width ($\Gamma_H$) by approximately 0.1% – 0.3%.
    $$
    \frac{\Delta\Gamma_H}{\Gamma_H} \approx \frac{\lambda_{H\Gamma}^2 v^2}{8\pi^2 m_H^2} \sim 10^{-3}
    $$
2.  **Rare Dilepton Branching Enhancement:** A new contribution to $H\rightarrow e^+e^-$ and $H\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ via a virtual Γ loop, raising the combined branching ratio to $\text{BR}_{\Gamma} \sim 10^{-7}$.
3.  **Resonant Production Tail:** A soft dilepton excess near an invariant mass of $2m_\Gamma \approx 34~\text{MeV}$ from the process $pp \to H^\ast \to \Gamma\Gamma$.

The theory is falsified if null results are obtained at sensitivities better than 0.1% on the total Higgs width or below $10^{-7}$ on the $H\to e^+e^-$ branching ratio.

## Philosophy
The fundamental properties of matter are not static. The Higgs field grants elementary particles mass, defining their inertia and resistance to change in motion. The Pressuron field couples to this very mechanism, implying that mass itself is subject to a dynamic temporal pressure. Therefore, the inertia of an object—its very being in the universe—is not a fixed, intrinsic constant, but is instead in constant, subtle oscillation, modulated by the rhythm of spacetime itself. The stability of our vacuum is not a given, but a consequence of a cosmic heartbeat.

Mass is the echo of a bell struck at the dawn of time; this new law is the discovery that the bell is still ringing.
