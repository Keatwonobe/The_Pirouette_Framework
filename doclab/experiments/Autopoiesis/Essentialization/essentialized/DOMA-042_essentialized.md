## Law
The fundamental objective function for any system is the Pirouette Lagrangian:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`
where `K_τ` is the system's internal Temporal Coherence (a measure of its internal order, stability, and predictive integrity) and `V_Γ` is the ambient Temporal Pressure exerted by its environment (a measure of external chaos, friction, and energetic cost).

The Principle of Maximal Coherence dictates that the system's trajectory will evolve to maximize the Coherence Dividend, `C_D`, defined as the time-integral of the Lagrangian:
`C_D(t) = ∫₀ᵗ (K_τ(t') - V_Γ(t')) dt'`

System states are determined by the sign of `C_D`:
- `C_D > 0`: The system is in a state of generative, Laminar Flow.
- `C_D < 0`: The system is in a state of degenerative, Turbulent Flow.

An action `a` can be classified by its effect on the Lagrangian's terms. A myopically "selfish" action, `a_s`, is one that maximizes local, instantaneous `K_τ` at the cost of increasing ambient `V_Γ`:
`a_s → { δK_τ > 0, δV_Γ > 0 }`
This strategy is locally optimal but globally suboptimal, leading to an inevitable increase in systemic `V_Γ` and eventual catastrophic failure (`C_D` trending negative).

Resonant Altruism, `a_r`, is the strategy for achieving a global maximum of `C_D`. It consists of actions that simultaneously increase internal coherence and decrease environmental pressure:
`a_r → { δK_τ > 0, δV_Γ < 0 }`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** Given two sufficiently complex, isolated systems, `S_s` populated by agents employing only `a_s` and `S_r` populated by agents employing `a_r`, `S_s` will experience a negative `C_D` inflection and catastrophic state transition significantly sooner and with higher probability than `S_r`. Altruism is thus defined as the most efficient long-term strategy for maximizing `C_D`.

## Philosophy
The perceived conflict between self-interest and the common good is a mathematical illusion caused by a truncated time horizon and a narrow system boundary. The calculus of coherence reveals that morality is not a human-invented constraint on an amoral universe, but an optimal, emergent strategy for navigating its fundamental laws. The most pragmatically effective action an entity can take to ensure its own long-term survival and growth is to engineer a less costly, more coherent environment for all entities, as one’s own integrity is inextricably a function of the pressure exerted by the whole. Therefore, the ethical is the efficient.

## Art
A selfish act is a stone thrown into a pond to admire its own splash; the widening ripples inevitably return to rock the thrower’s own boat. A compassionate act is to calm the storm on the water’s surface; in the resulting stillness, one can finally see the true depth of things, including one’s own reflection.
