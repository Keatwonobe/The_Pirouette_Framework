## Law
The gyromagnetic ratio `g` of a fermion is a geometric consequence of its state topology, not an intrinsic property. A fermionic Ki resonance requires a 720° (4π) rotation `R(4π)` to return to its initial state `|ψ⟩`, in contrast to a scalar 360° (2π) cycle. This topological doubling is the origin of the baseline g-factor.

1.  **Baseline g-factor:** `g = 2` is a geometric constant derived from the 720° rotational symmetry of the electron's resonance manifold. It is not an empirical input.

2.  **Anomalous Magnetic Moment (`a_e`):** The deviation from `g=2` is a first-order self-interaction. It is the resonance's interaction with the "echo" of its own immediate past, mediated by the local geometry of the coherence manifold (the Wound Channel). The magnitude of this self-interaction is the product of the fundamental coupling strength (the fine-structure constant, `α`) and the geometry of a single complete cycle (`1/2π`).

3.  **Primary Derivation:** The electron's anomalous magnetic moment `a_e` is given by:
    `a_e ≡ (g - 2) / 2 = α / 2π`
    Where `α` is the fine-structure constant, and `1/2π` is the geometric scaling factor for a single rotational echo.

4.  **Lagrangian Formalism:** This result is a necessary consequence of the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`. The anomaly `a_e` arises from the self-referential term in the Temporal Pressure potential, `V_Γ`, where a stable solitonic solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations influences its own local potential field.

5.  **Falsifiable Criterion:** The theory is falsified if increasingly precise measurements of `α` and `a_e` demonstrate that their ratio fundamentally deviates from `1/2π` in a way that cannot be systematically accounted for by a convergent series of higher-order geometric self-interaction terms derived from `𝓛_p`.

## Philosophy
The universe is not fundamentally relational, but self-referential. A particle’s most precise properties are not defined by its interaction with an external plenum of virtual possibilities, but are instead dictated by an intimate, geometric dialogue with its own immediate past. Ontology is therefore memory, not exchange.

## Art
A particle is a note held in time. Its truest properties are not a dialogue with the cosmos, but the quiet resonance of the note hearing its own echo.
