## Law
The coherence field Ψ is a superposition of two counter-rotating vortices, representing constructive (Ψ⁺) and dissipative (Ψ⁻) flows, governed by a modified Navier-Stokes equation under temporal pressure Γ:
[Ψ = Ψ⁺ + Ψ⁻]
[∂_tΨ + (Ψ·∇)Ψ = −∇P + ν∇²Ψ + F(Γ)]

The system's state is defined by the Caduceus Operator (ℭ), a measure of helicity or the intertwining rate of the dual coherence streams:
[ℭ = ∇×(Ψ⁺−Ψ⁻) + λ(Ψ⁺·Ψ⁻)]

A stable, laminar coherence regime exists for |ℭ| < ℭ_c. Transition to a turbulent, dissonant regime occurs when the intertwining rate reaches a critical threshold, |ℭ| ≥ ℭ_c. This transition is driven by the temporal pressure Γ approaching a critical value Γ_c, which geometrically manifests as a curvature inversion in the coherence manifold:
[κ_{eff} = κ_0 (1 − Γ/Γ_c)]

The dynamics of the system universally follow a logistic flow law, approaching the critical thresholds as fixed points:
[dℭ/dΓ = α(ℭ_c² − ℭ²)]

Two core principles govern the system:
1.  **Duality Conservation:** In a steady state, the product of the constructive and dissipative field amplitudes is constant. [Ψ⁺Ψ⁻ = K]
2.  **Topological Memory:** Each laminar–turbulent cycle imparts a lasting structural change to the manifold's base curvature (κ₀), observable via phase recurrence.

The theory is falsifiable under the following conditions:
*   **Hypothesis 1 (Universality):** The transition from laminar to turbulent regimes in physical, cognitive, and social systems is marked by a critical increase in the helicity metric |ℭ|. If |ℭ| remains invariant across state transitions driven by Γ, the theory is false.
*   **Hypothesis 2 (Duality):** The product Ψ⁺Ψ⁻ remains constant during stable epochs. A sustained violation of this conservation law falsifies the duality principle.
*   **Hypothesis 3 (Scaling):** The characteristic timescales of turbulent bursts (τ_T) and recovery (τ_R) must scale consistently across domains as predicted. If scaling exponents are domain-dependent, the unified flow model is false.

## Philosophy
The fundamental processes of becoming and dissolution—whether in the quantum foam, the cascade of a thought, or the collapse of a civilization—are not merely analogous but are mathematically isomorphic. They are expressions of a single, universal law of dynamic tension between constructive and destructive forces. Reality is not a collection of objects in various states, but a singular, scale-invariant flow whose essential geometry is the eternal, turbulent embrace of its own opposites.

## Art
All things are sculpted by two serpents spiraling around the staff of time. One weaves order from chaos, the other unwinds it back into possibility. We are not the weaver, nor the unraveled thread, but the shimmering, momentary knot where they cross.
