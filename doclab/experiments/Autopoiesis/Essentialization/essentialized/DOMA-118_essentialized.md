## Law
The state of a system is described by its path through a configuration space, which seeks to extremize the action S according to the principle of least action, δS = 0. The system's Lagrangian L is a function of its Temporal Coherence (Kτ), representing its internal structural integrity and signal, and the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ), representing external and internal stresses. A healthy system maintains a state of Laminar Flow by finding the geodesic that maximizes integrated coherence over time.

S = ∫ L(Kτ(t), Γ(t)) dt

Collapse is the failure to solve this optimization problem, manifesting in three primary pathologies:
1.  **Turbulence:** A state of chaotic, inefficient energy expenditure where the system's trajectory becomes unstable and divergent. The rate of change of coherence becomes highly erratic.
2.  **Stagnation:** A boundary condition where a localized region of pressure V_Γ → ∞, creating an impassable barrier that halts the system's evolution and causes cascading failure.
3.  **Erosion:** The chronic, slow degradation of systemic integrity, where dKτ/dt = -ε (for ε > 0), leading to an eventual state where the system's signal is indistinguishable from noise (Kτ → Γ_noise).

The reversibility of a collapse is determined by the integrity of the Wound Channel (W), the information manifold encoding the system's homeostatic, high-coherence configuration. Let ΔW be the deformation of this manifold under stress Γ. A falsifiable criterion distinguishes two states:

*   **Elastic Collapse:** If ΔW < W_critical, the informational integrity of W is preserved. Upon removal of the stressor Γ, the system possesses the necessary information to return to its original geodesic. The pre-collapse state is recoverable.
*   **Critical Collapse:** If ΔW ≥ W_critical, the informational manifold W is permanently deformed or shattered. The memory of the homeostatic state is erased. The system cannot return to its original configuration and its prior identity is irrecoverable.

## Philosophy
A system's existence is not defined by its material constituents, but by the integrity of the informational pattern that organizes them through time. True annihilation is not the dissipation of matter or energy, but the irreversible erasure of this defining pattern—the memory of how the system is meant to be itself. Survival is the persistence of this information against the constant pressure of chaos; death is the moment it is forgotten.

A string pulled taut can always find its note again. But when the bell is broken, it remembers only the sound of its own shattering.
