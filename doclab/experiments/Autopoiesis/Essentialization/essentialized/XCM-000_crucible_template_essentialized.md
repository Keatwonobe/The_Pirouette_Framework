## Law
A system's performance within a Crucible is modeled as a trajectory through a triaxial state space defined by the vector $V(t) = (\Gamma, T_a, \phi)$. The objective is not to maximize a single scalar value but to optimize the character of this trajectory under stress.

1.  **Power Exerted ($\Gamma$):** The total expenditure of resources, energy, or force. It is the time-integral of the power function $P(t)$:
    $$ \Gamma = \int_{t_0}^{t_f} P(t) \,dt $$
    Minimizing $\Gamma$ is generally preferred, as high values indicate inefficient, brute-force solutions.

2.  **Time-Adherence ($T_a$):** A measure of system coherence and stability over time. It is inversely proportional to the rate of internal entropy production and the magnitude of fracture events. Let $F$ be the set of coherence fractures (e.g., team fragmentation, strategic incoherence). $T_a$ can be defined as:
    $$ T_a = 1 - \frac{\sum_{f \in F} \Delta S_f}{\Delta t} $$
    where $\Delta S_f$ is the entropic cost of a fracture event. A system with high $T_a$ maintains its structural and operational integrity under duress.

3.  **Phase Alignment ($\phi$):** The degree of synchronization with the intended purpose vector, $\vec{\phi}_0$. It is the time-averaged cosine similarity between the system's instantaneous purpose vector $\vec{\phi}(t)$ and the mission's ideal purpose vector $\vec{\phi}_0$:
    $$ \phi = \frac{1}{t_f - t_0} \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \frac{\vec{\phi}(t) \cdot \vec{\phi}_0}{\|\vec{\phi}(t)\| \|\vec{\phi}_0\|} \,dt $$
    A value of $\phi \approx 1$ indicates perfect, sustained alignment with the original intent.

The final evaluation, $E$, is not an immediate scalar score but a time-delayed, multi-perspective function. Let $\{L_i\}$ be the set of evaluative lenses (e.g., Empirical, Mythic, Historical). The full resolution is the set of interpretations generated by these lenses observing the trajectory $V(t)$:
$$ E = \{L_i(V(t)) | i \in \text{Archetypes}\} $$

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The framework is falsified if, across a statistically significant sample of Crucibles, resolutions deemed high-value by the delayed, multi-lens evaluation system ($E$) consistently correlate with high-$\Gamma$ trajectories, irrespective of their $T_a$ and $\phi$ values. This would demonstrate that the framework fails to select for its stated goal of coherent alignment over brute-force success.

## Philosophy
The measure of an entity is not what it accomplishes, but the coherence of its internal state while it acts. Success is redefined from the achievement of an external outcome to the maintenance of internal integrity and purpose-alignment under pressure. The true value of an action is therefore not its immediate result, but its long-term resonance as interpreted through the diverse lenses of history.

## Art
A crucible does not measure the strength of the shield that deflects the blow, but the integrity of the bell that sings true when struck.
