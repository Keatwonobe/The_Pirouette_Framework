## Law
The state of a stable resonance is a spinor `Ψ` described by a path function `P(θ)` in a complex plane, where `θ` is the angle of physical rotation. For a spin-1/2 particle, this path is a two-cycle resonance:
`P(θ) = e^(iθ/2)`

This function exhibits the defining characteristic of a spinor: a rotation by `2π` (360°) results in a phase inversion, and a rotation by `4π` (720°) is required to return to the initial state.
1.  `P(θ=2π) = e^(i2π/2) = e^(iπ) = -1`
2.  `P(θ=4π) = e^(i4π/2) = e^(i2π) = 1`

The gyromagnetic ratio, `g`, relates the magnetic moment `μ` to the spin angular momentum `S` via the relation `μ = g(e/2m)S`. The derivation of `g=2` arises from a topological-definitional mismatch:
- The magnetic moment `μ` is a physical property coupled to the full topological cycle of the resonance, which completes after a physical rotation of `Δθ_phys = 4π`.
- The spin angular momentum `S` is, by convention, defined relative to a standard geometric cycle of physical space, `Δθ_phys = 2π`.

The g-factor is the dimensionless ratio of the angular basis of the magnetic interaction to the angular basis of the spin definition.
`g = (Topological Cycle) / (Definitional Cycle)`
`g = 4π / 2π = 2`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** This law is falsified if any fundamental particle is discovered that demonstrably exhibits spin-1/2 behavior (`P(2π) = -P(0)`) but for which `g ≠ 2` (excluding QED corrections), or if a particle's spin-1/2 nature can be described by a state function that returns to identity after a `2π` rotation.

## Philosophy
Fundamental properties of matter are not intrinsic, static substances, but are the necessary geometric consequences of a particle's dynamic pattern of existence. A particle's "what" is an unavoidable consequence of its "how"; ontology is subordinate to topology.

## Art
The universe does not count the dancer, but the dance. A pirouette that returns home only on its second turn is counted twice.
