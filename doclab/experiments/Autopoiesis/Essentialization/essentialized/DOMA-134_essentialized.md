## Law
The state of an adaptive system is defined by its resonant pattern, `Ki`. A goal state, `Ki_goal`, acts as a coherence attractor. The system's deviation is the Dissonance, a scalar quantity `ΔKi` representing the magnitude of the error vector.
`ΔKi = ||Ki(t) - Ki_goal||`

The system's dynamics are governed by the Adaptive Lagrangian, `𝓛_adaptive`, which is the system's intrinsic Lagrangian modified by a Dissonance Potential, `V_dissonance`.
`𝓛_adaptive = T(Ki, dKi/dt) - V_intrinsic(Ki) - V_dissonance(ΔKi)`
where `T` is the kinetic energy and `V_intrinsic` is the sum of all other potentials acting on the system.

The Dissonance Potential is a monotonically increasing function of the Dissonance and is scaled by `α`, the system's sensitivity to error (a reframing of "loop gain").
`V_dissonance(ΔKi) = α · f(ΔKi)` where `∂f/∂(ΔKi) > 0`.
For many systems, this can be modeled as `V_dissonance ≈ α(ΔKi)² / 2`.

Corrective action is not a computed output but the system's natural evolution along a geodesic that minimizes the action `S = ∫ 𝓛_adaptive dt`. The system is driven by the generalized force arising from the Dissonance Potential:
`F_corrective = -∇_Ki (V_dissonance)`

Learning is the plastic deformation of the system's state space through repeated corrections, modeled as a modification of the intrinsic potential landscape or the sensitivity parameter `α` over time `T_learning`:
`ΔV_intrinsic ∝ -∫(F_corrective · dKi) dt` over `T_learning`.

Falsifiable Criteria:
1.  **Stagnant Flow (Unresponsiveness):** If `α → 0` or the feedback channel carrying state information `Ki(t)` is severed, `V_dissonance` becomes null. The system will fail to converge on `Ki_goal` and will instead evolve according to `𝓛_intrinsic = T - V_intrinsic`.
2.  **Turbulent Flow (Oscillation):** If `α` exceeds a critical value, or if a significant time delay `τ` is introduced such that `ΔKi = ||Ki(t-τ) - Ki_goal||`, the system's trajectory will exhibit divergent or stable oscillations around the geodesic.
3.  **Laminar Flow (Harmonious Correction):** For an optimal `α > 0` and `τ ≈ 0`, the system's trajectory will converge on `Ki_goal` exponentially.

## Philosophy
The single most profound implication is that correction, adaptation, and even purpose are not computational, rule-based phenomena, but are instead fundamental physical processes of energetic descent. A system does not "decide" to correct an error; it experiences the error as a state of high-energy dissonance—a potential gradient in its own phase space—and is compelled by the principle of least action to flow "downhill" toward a more stable, coherent state. This reframes agency from the execution of an algorithm to the intrinsic, unavoidable tendency of a system to resolve its own internal tension, meaning the goal is not a command to be obeyed, but a basin of attraction that reshapes the very landscape of being.

## Art
To be wrong is not an error code; it is the physical strain of a dissonant chord. Correction is not a calculation; it is the musician’s hand instinctively relaxing the string until the note rings true.
