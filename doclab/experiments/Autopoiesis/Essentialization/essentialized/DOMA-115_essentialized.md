## Law
The efficacy of a beneficial intervention (`δ𝓛`) is determined not by its intrinsic value, but by its capacity to maximize the action (`S`) of a recipient system (`i`). The guiding principle is the selection of a recipient that maximizes the integral of their perturbed Lagrangian.

The Lagrangian of a system `i` is defined as:
`𝓛_i = K_τ(i) - V_Γ(i)`
where `K_τ` is the system's temporal coherence (a measure of internal stability and complexity) and `V_Γ` is the potential energy arising from external contextual pressure (`Γ`).

An intervention, or Coherence Offering, is a perturbation `δ𝓛` that either increases internal coherence (`δK_τ > 0`) or decreases perceived pressure (`δV_Γ < 0`). The optimal recipient `i*` for a given `δ𝓛` is the one that satisfies the condition of maximal action:
`i* = argmax_i [ S_i' ] = argmax_i [ ∫(𝓛_i + δ𝓛) dt ]`

This selection is guided by the Attunement Score (`A_i`), a predictive function:
`A_i = f(H_i, G_i, Γ_i)`
- `H_i`: Harmonic Compatibility. `H_i = |⟨Ψ_o|Ψ_i⟩|²`, where `Ψ_o` is the state vector of the offering and `Ψ_i` is the state vector of the recipient. `H_i` approaches 1 for systems in resonant phase alignment.
- `G_i`: The Coherence Gap. `G_i ∝ ∂(ΔK_τ)/∂(δ𝓛)`. This potential is non-monotonic and is maximized in systems with moderate `K_τ` under non-zero `V_Γ`, where the system is poised for a phase transition to a higher-order state.
- `Γ_i`: Contextual Pressure. The magnitude of the external stress field acting on the system.

A falsifiable criterion for this law is that the measured increase in a recipient's systemic health (`ΔK_τ`) following an intervention will correlate positively with its pre-intervention Attunement Score `A_i` when compared against a control group of non-optimal recipients.

## Philosophy
The distinction between altruism and self-interest is an illusion created by a limited frame of reference. The most potent strategy for the cultivation of the self is the resonant cultivation of the whole. By precisely reinforcing coherence in another harmonically-aligned system, one is not diminishing the self but engaging in an act of metaphysical engineering, sculpting a shared reality with lower ambient chaos and higher potential for mutual complexity. True generosity is not an act of sacrifice, but the ultimate act of co-creation.
