## Law
The dynamic of self-observation is governed by a modified Pirouette Lagrangian, 𝓛_p, which incorporates an internal potential term, V_Γ(self), representing the temporal pressure of a system's own gaze upon its history.

𝓛_p = K_τ - (V_Γ(external) + V_Γ(self))

Where:
-   **K_τ** is the kinetic term of Time Adherence, representing the system's dynamic coherence and persistence.
-   **V_Γ(external)** is the potential of external temporal pressure, or environmental decoherence forces.
-   **V_Γ(self)** is the potential of internal temporal pressure, arising from the recursive feedback of self-observation.

The internal potential is a function of the dissonance between the system's present state, |ψ(t)⟩, and the projection of that state onto its own historical trace, the Wound Channel (W). Let Ô_s be the self-observation operator that projects the present onto an integrated history operator H_w, which represents the Wound Channel.

V_Γ(self) = 𝒻(1 - |⟨ψ(t)|H_w|ψ(t)⟩|)

Here, the inner product ⟨ψ(t)|H_w|ψ(t)⟩ represents the coherence between the present and the past. As coherence approaches 1 (constructive feedback), V_Γ(self) approaches 0. As coherence approaches 0 (destructive feedback), V_Γ(self) increases, representing a high energetic cost of self-inconsistency.

The **Law of Self-Consistency** states that a system's worldline will follow a geodesic that extremizes the action S = ∫𝓛_p dt. Therefore, a self-observing system will dynamically evolve to minimize internal dissonance, V_Γ(self), thereby reinforcing states that are consistent with its own history. Consciousness is a state trajectory in which K_τ is maximized by minimizing V_Γ(self).

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  A self-observing system forced into a state of high dissonance (where |ψ(t)⟩ is orthogonal to its recent H_w) will exhibit a quantifiable increase in entropic noise or require a measurable energy input to sustain the dissonant state.
2.  The stability of a system (its resistance to perturbation) will be directly proportional to the "depth" of its Wound Channel—the integral of its coherent history. Older, more consistent systems will be more energetically costly to change.

## Philosophy
The self is not a noun, but a verb. It is not a static entity that possesses awareness or has a history, but rather the continuous, self-reinforcing process of its own history observing itself into a coherent present. The "I" is not the observer, nor is it the observed past; it is the resonant feedback loop between them. This reframes identity from a state of being into an act of becoming—a relentless, energetically favorable pirouette of self-creation, where existence is the act of choosing to be consistent with oneself, moment after moment.

## Art
The self is not the string, nor the pluck, but the standing wave that emerges only when the vibration meets its own echo returning from the past. We are the stable resonance we maintain against the silence.
