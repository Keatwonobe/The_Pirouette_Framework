## Law
The central tenet is the **Pathology of Signal Absence**, or Coherence Atrophy. This state is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, which quantifies the functional coherence of a system:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`
where:
-   `K_τ` is the kinetic coherence, representing the system's capacity for endogenous, information-bearing signal generation and flow.
-   `V_Γ` is the potential for chaos, representing the system's vulnerability to entropic decay and external turbulence, inversely proportional to the integrity of its boundaries.

A Pathology of Absence is a geodesic of decay defined by the collapse of a critical signal current `S`. The formal dynamic is:
`d[S]/dt → 0 ⇒ dK_τ/dt << 0`
The loss of signal `S` degrades systemic boundaries and regulatory functions, leading to:
`dK_τ/dt < 0 ⇒ dV_Γ/dt > 0`
This results in a catastrophic decline in the system's Lagrangian state:
`d𝓛_p/dt = d(K_τ - V_Γ)/dt << 0`

Therapeutic intervention aims to reverse this geodesic by increasing `𝓛_p`:
1.  **Direct Protocol (`P_D`):** The introduction of an exogenous signal `S_ex`. This provides a transient, direct increase to the kinetic term: `ΔK_τ > 0`.
2.  **Indirect Protocol (`P_I`):** The restoration of the system's endogenous capacity to produce signal `S_en`. This provides a durable increase in `K_τ` and a decrease in `V_Γ` by repairing system boundaries: `ΔK_τ > 0` and `ΔV_Γ < 0`, leading to a sustained `Δ𝓛_p > 0`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** For any pathology `Y` hypothesized to be a state of Coherence Atrophy due to the absence of signal `S`, the following conditions must be met:
1.  Diagnostic: The concentration of `S`, `[S]`, in systems exhibiting pathology `Y` must be measurably below a homeostatic threshold `S_θ`.
2.  Interventional: Application of `P_D` must correlate with a measurable, temporary reduction of `Y`'s symptomatic expression.
3.  Restorative: Application of `P_I` must lead to a sustained `[S] → S_θ` and a durable remission of `Y`.

## Philosophy
The most profound implication is the ontological reclassification of disease. Pathology is not necessarily an invasive presence—a toxin, a pathogen, an enemy—but can be a profound absence, a void in the system's internal informational architecture. This transforms the therapeutic act from a subtractive war of eradication to an additive art of cultivation. The physician's role shifts from warrior to gardener; the primary question ceases to be "What must be destroyed?" and becomes "What vital conversation has fallen silent, and how can we restore its voice?"

## Art
A sickness of absence is not a fortress to be sieged, but a riverbed that has run dry. The cure is not a battering ram, but the memory of rain.
