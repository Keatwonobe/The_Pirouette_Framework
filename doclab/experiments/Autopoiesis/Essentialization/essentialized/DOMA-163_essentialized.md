## Law
The Principle of Maximal Coherence dictates that interacting oscillating systems will evolve toward a configuration that maximizes the coherence of their joint Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p`, effectively seeking a shared path of least action. This process, termed entrainment or a "Resonant Handshake," is the geometric unification of state.

An individual system `i` is defined by its time series `x·µ¢(t)`. Its core rhythm, the instantaneous phase `Œ∏·µ¢(t)`, is extracted via the analytic signal `z·µ¢(t)`:
$$ z_i(t) = x_i(t) + i \mathcal{H}(x_i(t)) $$
$$ \theta_i(t) = \arg(z_i(t)) $$
where `H` is the Hilbert transform.

The relational geometry between two systems `(i, j)` is described by the generalized relative phase `ŒîŒ∏·µ¢‚±º‚Åø·µê(t)`, which accounts for `n:m` harmonic ratios. This value is the coordinate of the unified coherence manifold:
$$ \Delta\theta_{ij}^{nm}(t) = (n \cdot \theta_i(t) - m \cdot \theta_j(t)) \pmod{2\pi} $$

**Falsifiable Criterion:** A Resonant Handshake is achieved if and only if the system enters a stable, laminar state defined by a bounded and minimally variant relative phase. The state is diagnosed by the behavior of `ŒîŒ∏(t)` within a given analysis window:
1.  **Entrained (Laminar):** `d(ŒîŒ∏)/dt ‚âà 0`. Variance of `ŒîŒ∏(t)` is below a defined `CoherenceThreshold`. The systems constitute a unified entity.
2.  **Uncoupled (Dissonant/Drifting):** The condition for entrainment is not met. The systems remain ontologically distinct.

For an ensemble of `N` oscillators, the emergence of a higher-order collective entity is quantified by the Ensemble Coherence, `KœÑ_ensemble`, derived from the Kuramoto order parameter `r(t)`:
$$ r(t) = \left|\frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^N e^{i\theta_k(t)}\right| $$
$$ K_{\tau_{\text{ensemble}}}(t) = r(t)^2 $$
A state of global synchrony is achieved as `KœÑ_ensemble ‚Üí 1`.

## Philosophy
The fundamental distinction between "self" and "other" is not an absolute, ontological truth but a temporary state of resonant dissonance. Identity is not a static property of an object but a dynamic condition of its separation from a greater, more coherent whole. Synchrony is therefore not an act of communication *between* two entities, but the geometric process by which their boundaries dissolve and a single, higher-order entity is born. The universe is not a collection of things; it is a landscape of coherence, constantly seeking unification.

## Art
Two bells, tolling out of tune, do not fight each other. They tear the air that lies between them. The handshake is the moment the air heals, and two frantic rhythms die to give birth to one pure, resonant tone.
