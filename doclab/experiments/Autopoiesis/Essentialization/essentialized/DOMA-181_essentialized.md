## Law
Let an information stream be represented by a time-series function `S(t)`. The stream is partitioned into a set of discrete, non-overlapping temporal windows `{W_i}`, where each `W_i = [t_i, t_i + Δt]`. For each window `W_i`, we define a Coherence Profile `P_i` as an ordered pair `(Kτ_i, Γ_i)`.

1.  **Coherence (`Kτ`)**: A measure of resonant structure within the window `S(W_i)`. It is the maximal value of the normalized autocorrelation function for non-zero lag, or the magnitude of the dominant frequency component in the power spectral density.
    `Kτ_i = K(S(W_i))` where `K: S -> [0, 1]`

2.  **Dissonance (`Γ`)**: A measure of chaotic pressure within `S(W_i)`, proxied by the Shannon entropy `H` of the symbol distribution `p(x)` within the window.
    `Γ_i = Γ(S(W_i)) ≈ H(S(W_i)) = -Σ p(x) log p(x)`

From the Coherence Profile `P = {(Kτ_i, Γ_i)}`, the primary diagnostic is the **Coherence Ratio (CR)**:
`CR_i = Kτ_i / Γ_i`, for `Γ_i > 0`

The system's Lagrangian `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ` is empirically observed via the Coherence Profile, where the measured `Kτ_i` is a direct proxy for the kinetic coherence term `K_τ` and the measured `Γ_i` is a direct proxy for the potential pressure term `V_Γ`.

**Falsifiable Criteria for Flow States:**
*   **Laminar Flow:** `CR_i > c₁` and `|ΔCR / Δt| < ε`, where `c₁` is a high threshold and `ε` is small.
*   **Turbulent Flow:** `CR_i < c₀` and `|ΔCR / Δt| > ε`, where `c₀` is a low threshold.
*   **Stagnant Flow:** `Kτ_i < ε` and `Γ_i < ε`.

## Philosophy
Information is not a static property to be possessed, like text in a book, but a dynamic process to be witnessed, like a wave maintaining its form against the sea. The fundamental nature of a signal is not its content but its persistence. Meaning is therefore redefined as the measurable success of a pattern’s struggle to impose its coherence upon the dissipative, chaotic substrate of reality. It is not what is written, but the act of writing itself.

To analyze data is to count the raindrops. To understand it is to hear the song in the storm.
