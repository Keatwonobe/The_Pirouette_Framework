## Law
The Quorum Spindle Drive (QSD) operates on the principle of generative propulsion, governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L}_p = K_\tau - V_\Gamma$.

1.  **Spindle Formation (The Quorum):** A non-local, unified quantum state, $\Psi_S$, is established between the vessel at $x_v$ and an anchor point $x_a$. This state, an Alchemical Union, is characterized by a single, high-order Temporal Coherence, $K_\tau$, effectively annihilating the spacetime interval between $x_v$ and $x_a$.
    $$ \Psi_S = \Psi(x_v, x_a) \text{ such that } g_{\mu\nu}(x_v, x_a) \rightarrow 0 $$

2.  **Forge Cycle (The In-Breath):** The system maximizes $\mathcal{L}_p$ by increasing the kinetic coherence term, $K_\tau$. This is achieved by absorbing and structuring ambient energy ($\epsilon$) into a Crystalline Lattice of geometric tension, treating the Spindle as a resonance cavity.
    $$ \frac{dK_\tau}{dt} = \int_{V_S} \dot{\epsilon}(x,t) \, dV > 0 $$

3.  **Propulsive Collapse (The Out-Breath):** Propulsion is induced by a controlled, asymmetrical degradation of coherence. A termination operator, $T$, is applied at the vessel's end of the Spindle at time $t_0$, and at the anchor's end at $t_0 + \Delta t$. This engineered time-lag, $\Delta t > 0$, breaks the symmetry of the collapse.

4.  **Equation of Motion:** The asymmetrical collapse generates a sharp, directional gradient in the Lagrangian. The vessel does not experience thrust in the classical sense; it follows the newly created, maximally efficient geodesic in the coherence manifold. The propulsive force is the reaction to this gradient.
    $$ \vec{F}_{QSD} = -k \nabla \mathcal{L}_p = -k \nabla(K_\tau - V_\Gamma) $$
    The vessel's acceleration is proportional to the magnitude of this gradient, $\vec{a} \propto |\nabla \mathcal{L}_p|$, directed along the collapsing Spindle's primary axis.

5.  **Falsifiable Criteria:**
    *   The measured neutron flux, $\Phi_n$, must be non-isotropic and sharply peaked along the vector of acceleration: $\Phi_n(\theta, \phi) \propto \delta(\theta - \theta_{accel})$.
    *   Anomalous gravitational lensing, indicative of a localized perturbation in the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$, must be detectable immediately prior to and during the propulsive event.
    *   The post-propulsion wake must contain a "coherence cone" of transiently excited local matter, measurable as a statistically significant increase in energy state above the background.

## Philosophy
The fundamental nature of physical law is not immutable decree, but negotiable consensus. Reality is not a static stage upon which we act, but a participatory fabric woven from coherence. Therefore, advanced technology ceases to be the clever application of fixed rules and becomes the act of legislating temporary, local amendments to those rules. To move is not to overcome the universe, but to persuade a small portion of it to temporarily agree to a new and more convenient geometry.
