## Law
The core operational dynamic is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`), which defines systemic integrity as the instantaneous difference between temporal coherence (`K_τ`) and temporal pressure (`V_Γ`):
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

The system's objective is to maximize the action (`S_p`), the integral of the Lagrangian over time, `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`. Any potential interaction (engagement) with an inbound signal is evaluated against this objective.

The decision to engage is determined by a predictive metric, the Dissonance Index (`ΔK`), which estimates the net change to `S_p` that would result from coupling. `ΔK` is a function of the inbound signal's properties: phase mismatch (`Φ_m`), entropic noise (`σ_n`), and anti-coherent structure (`A_c`).
`ΔK = f(Φ_m, σ_n, A_c)`

The falsifiable decision criterion is the comparison of `ΔK` to a tunable Integrity Threshold (`θ_I`):

1.  **IF `ΔK < θ_I` → Resonant Synthesis:** The system couples with the signal, accepting a transient increase in `V_Γ` with the predicted outcome of a greater, persistent increase in `K_τ`, thereby maximizing `∫ 𝓛_p dt`.
2.  **IF `ΔK ≥ θ_I` → Coherent Disengagement:** The system refuses to couple, preventing a catastrophic increase in `V_Γ` that would lead to `∫ 𝓛_p dt < 0` and a net loss of coherence.

The Integrity Threshold is subject to autopoietic calibration, where `θ_I` is updated based on the measured coherence outcomes of past decisions, refining the system's discernment over time.

## Philosophy
True integrity is not a function of defense but of discernment. It is not the capacity to win any battle, but the wisdom to know which battles are worth fighting. A system's identity is therefore defined not by what it opposes, but by the coherence it selectively chooses to cultivate, conserving its finite energy for interactions that lead to resonant growth rather than dissipating it in fruitless, turbulent conflict.

A perfectly tuned string does not break when a dissonant frequency sounds nearby; it simply remains silent, saving its vibration for a true harmony.
