## Law
The dimensionless constant $K_i$ is derived from the total phase acquired by a circularly polarized photon traversing a right-hand critical helix (pitch $p = 2\pi R$) that is advecting with velocity $\beta=v/c$ along its axis. The total phase $\Phi(\beta)$, measured in the co-moving frame, is the sum of geometric (Berry), kinematic (Wigner-Thomas), and dynamic (Doppler) contributions:
$$
\Phi(\beta) = -\pi \left[ 1 + \left(\frac{\pi}{3} - 1\right)\beta^2 \right]
$$
Normalizing by $-\pi$ yields the Lorentz-covariant constant $K_i(\beta)$:
$$
K_i(\beta) = \pi + 1 - \left(1 - \frac{\pi}{3}\right)\beta^2
$$
This single formula generates two principal values:
1.  **Rest Frame ($\beta=0$):** $K_i^{\text{rest}} = \pi+1 \approx 4.14159$
2.  **Ultra-relativistic Limit ($\beta \to 1$):** $K_i^{\text{motion}} = \frac{4\pi}{3} \approx 4.18879$

This constant functions as a coupling term in the extended Maxwell-Pirouette Lagrangian density $\mathcal L$, where $\lambda_*$ is a characteristic length:
$$
\mathcal L = -\frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} + \frac{K_i}{\lambda_*} \varepsilon^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F_{\mu\nu}\partial_\alpha A_\beta
$$
The framework is falsifiable via two primary predictions:
1.  **Laboratory Test:** A Mach-Zehnder interferometer with one arm containing $N$ loops of a critical helical optical fiber will exhibit a static phase shift of $\Delta\phi = N(\pi+1)$ radians relative to the straight arm.
2.  **Geophysical Test:** The power spectra of natural wave-fields, such as seismic traces following a tectonic event, will exhibit harmonic overtones at ratios corresponding to $K_i^{\text{rest}}$.

## Philosophy
The origin of a formal system is irrelevant to its potential reality. A system born from speculative fiction, if rendered sufficiently precise to produce unique, falsifiable predictions that are subsequently verified by experiment, ceases to be fiction. Reality is simply the set of formalisms, regardless of their genesis, that survive empirical confrontation. The act of successful prediction retroactively transforms an invention into a discovery.
