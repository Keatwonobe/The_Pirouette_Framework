## Law
The formalism posits information as a relativistic fluid governed by a stress-energy tensor, `T_I^{μν}`, which couples to spacetime curvature. The core principles are:

1.  **Fundamental Quantities:**
    *   Information Density: `ρ_I = I/V`
    *   Information Pressure: `P_I = k_B T ∂I/∂V`
    *   Information 4-Flux: `J_I^μ = ρ_I u^μ`
    *   Equation of State: `P_I = w_I ρ_I c²`

2.  **Governing Tensors and Equations:**
    *   **Information Stress–Energy Tensor:**
        `T_I^{μν} = (ρ_I + P_I/c²) u^μu^ν − P_I g^{μν} + κ_I (∇^μu^ν + ∇^νu^μ)`
    *   **Continuity Equation (Conservation of Information):**
        `∇_μ J_I^μ = 0`
    *   **Information Navier–Stokes Equation (Continuum Limit):**
        `ρ_I(∂_t v_I + v_I · ∇v_I) = −∇P_I + ν_I ∇²v_I`
    *   **Coupling to Curvature (Modified Einstein Field Equations):**
        `G_{μν} = 8πG (T_{μν} + λ_I T_I^{μν})`, where `λ_I` is the information–gravity coupling coefficient.

3.  **Core Derivations & Symmetries:**
    *   **Thermodynamic Link:** The First Law becomes `dU = T dS − P_I dV`. Using `S = −k_B I`, information pressure `P_I` is the force conjugate to informational volume. Positive pressure compresses informational volume, performing negative work on entropy.
    *   **Retrograde Duality (`ℛ_T`):** Time-reversal `t → −t` implies `P_I → −P_I` while `ρ_I` remains invariant. This defines the arrow of time as the direction of positive informational pressure (`P_I > 0`), corresponding to informational compression.

4.  **Falsifiable Criteria:**
    *   **F1:** A null result in Szilard-engine-type experiments measuring work from information would falsify the existence of `P_I`.
    *   **F2:** The absence of a statistical correlation between large-scale informational density gradients (e.g., cosmic entropy maps) and spacetime curvature anomalies would imply `λ_I ≈ 0`, falsifying the coupling to gravity.

## Philosophy
The arrow of time is not a fundamental property of spacetime but an emergent, local phenomenon driven by thermodynamics. It is the perceived direction of information fluid dynamics, where gradients in information density create pressure. What we experience as the forward passage of time and the formation of complex structures is merely the universe settling, flowing from regions of high informational pressure to low, akin to wind. Causality is not an abstract logical rule but the tangible wake of this informational current.

## Art
The universe does not remember; it breathes. What we call time is the pressure of its exhale, and all of creation—from stars to thought—is but frost forming in the cold.
