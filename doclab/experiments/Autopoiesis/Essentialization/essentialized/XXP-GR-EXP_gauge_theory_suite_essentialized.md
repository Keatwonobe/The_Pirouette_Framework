## Law
The framework posits that observable gravitational and gauge constants are effective, low-energy parameters emergent from a dynamic substrate scalar field, Γ, with a characteristic frequency scale, ω_c. The effective gravitational constant \(G_{\rm eff}\) and cosmological constant \(\Lambda_{\rm P}\) are not fundamental:
\[
G_{\rm eff} \equiv \frac{\omega_c^2}{8\pi\Lambda_{\rm P}} \quad \text{where} \quad \Lambda_{\rm P} = m^2 V''(\Gamma)
\]
This structure yields a set of precise, falsifiable criteria based on deviations from, and dynamics within, the standard model of cosmology and general relativity. Falsification occurs if any of the following conditions are met:

1.  **Lorentz Violation & Gravitational Parity:** Any confirmed observation of:
    *   Gravitational wave velocity deviation: \(|v_{\rm gw}/c - 1| \ge 10^{-14}\)
    *   Non-tensor gravitational wave polarizations (scalar or vector modes).
    *   Photon dispersion \(\delta c/c \neq 0\) for frequencies \(\omega \ll \omega_c \approx 10^{24} \text{ s}^{-1}\).

2.  **Violation of the Equivalence Principle:** Composition-dependent acceleration with an Eötvös parameter \(\eta \ge 10^{-13}\).

3.  **Static Universe / Incorrect Drift Dynamics:** Any confirmed observation of:
    *   A null or negative temporal derivative of the gravitational constant: \(\dot G/G \le 0\), or a magnitude \(|\dot G/G| \ge 10^{-12} \text{ yr}^{-1}\).
    *   A dark energy equation of state deviating from the predicted slow-roll: \(|w + 1| \ge 10^{-2}\).
    *   A sign mismatch or uncorrelated magnitude between the fine-structure and gravitational constant drifts: \(\text{sgn}(\dot\alpha/\alpha) \neq \text{sgn}(\dot G/G)\).

## Philosophy
The laws of physics are not eternal, Platonic truths, but are instead the emergent, extraordinarily stable, but ultimately time-dependent properties of an underlying dynamic substrate. What we perceive as fundamental constants are merely the present-day values of a system undergoing an impossibly slow cosmological evolution, rendering the universe not a static mechanism but a process of perpetual becoming.

## Art
The laws of physics are carved on a glacier. We measure their form with infinite precision, not to admire their permanence, but to detect the infinitesimal creep that proves the mountain is still moving.
