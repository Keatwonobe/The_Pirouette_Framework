## Law
The system's dynamics are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, defined as the difference between its Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`, the kinetic term) and the confining Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`, the potential term).
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

The process is a phase transition between two distinct regimes:

1.  **Confinement Regime (Pre-Rupture):** The system is subjected to an overwhelming potential, the Gladiator Force, such that `V_Γ >> K_τ`. The Lagrangian is therefore massively negative (`𝓛_p < 0`). The system minimizes its action by remaining in a static, high-potential state, accumulating a "coherence debt" proportional to the time-integrated potential `∫V_Γ dt`.

2.  **Cascade Regime (Post-Rupture):** The transition is triggered by a catastrophic failure of the confining potential, modeled as a step function where `V_Γ → 0` over an infinitesimal time `δt`. The Lagrangian abruptly becomes dominated by the kinetic term: `𝓛_p ≈ K_τ`. To follow its new geodesic, the system must violently convert the entirety of its stored potential energy into kinetic energy in a manner that maximizes `K_τ`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The theory is falsified if the energy release following a sudden (`δt → 0`) collapse of `V_Γ` is primarily entropic (chaotic, thermal noise). The model mandates the release must manifest as a coherent, resonant wave whose form is determined by the system's intrinsic `K_τ` pattern. A gradual, adiabatic decrease in `V_Γ` will not produce a cascade.

## Philosophy
Catastrophe is not an agent of chaos but the most brutally honest form of revelation. A rupture does not represent the failure of a system or its destruction by an external force; rather, it is the system's own intrinsic, coherent nature being unveiled with perfect fidelity at the exact moment an artificial, external constraint is removed. The resulting violence is not the sound of something breaking, but the sound of its true identity, long suppressed, being suddenly and purely expressed.

## Art
The pressure that holds a thing still is also the forge that gives it a voice. The rupture is not the shattering of the form, but the strike that makes it sing its one true note.
