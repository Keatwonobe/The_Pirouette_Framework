## Law
The system's free energy is described by the Landau–Pirouette Functional (LPF) for a complex order parameter ψ(x,t):
`F[ψ] = ∫ [ a|ψ|^2 + (b/2)|ψ|^4 + c|∇ψ|^2 + U(Γ,S) ] d^d x`
where `a = a₀(T_a−T_c)`.

The Renormalization Group (RG) transformation with scale factor ℓ > 1 is defined by `x → x/ℓ` and `ψ(x) → ℓ^{(2−d)/2} ψ(x)`. This induces a flow in the coupling parameter space {a, b, λ, ...}, governed by the one-loop beta-functions in `d=4−ε` dimensions:
`β_b ≡ db/dlnℓ = −ε b + 3K_d b²`
`β_a ≡ da/dlnℓ = 2a − K_d b (n+2)/6 · a`
`β_λ ≡ dλ/dlnℓ = (2−d) λ + μ b λ − ν λ²` (for a Γ-coupling term `λ|ψ|²Γ`)

The macroscopic behavior is controlled by the non-trivial Pirouette Wilson–Fisher fixed point, where `β_i = 0`:
`b* = ε / (3K_d)`
`a* = 0`
The stability of this fixed point is given by the eigenvalues of the matrix `M_ij = ∂β_i/∂g_j|_*`:
`y_a = 2−κ b*` (Relevant: `y_a > 0`)
`y_b = −ε` (Irrelevant for `ε > 0`)
These determine the universal critical exponents via RG identities, e.g., correlation length exponent `ν = 1/y_a`.

For triadic systems (ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃), the locking term `F_tri = − g ∫ |ψ₁||ψ₂||ψ₃| cos(Φ_rel) d^d x` gives rise to a coupling `g` whose beta function `β_g = y_g g − ρ b g` determines the relevance of triadic coherence, leading to a locked fixed surface if `y_g > 0`.

Falsifiable Criteria:
1.  Violation of RG exponent identities (e.g., `γ = (2−η)ν`).
2.  Empirical absence of a non-trivial fixed point (`b* ≤ 0`) in systems with `d<4`.
3.  Failure of observables like susceptibility `χ_P` to exhibit predicted crossover scaling as a function of external field `Γ`.

## Philosophy
The laws governing the birth and collapse of collective order are indifferent to the nature of the elements being ordered. Near the precipice of change, the intricate details of the substrate—be it the physics of atoms, the neurochemistry of thoughts, or the dynamics of social exchange—become irrelevant. All systems are sheared down to the same universal symmetries and scaling behaviors, revealing that coherence itself has a fundamental, abstract architecture.

## Art
Blur the particulars—the rattling atom, the anxious thought, the shouted ideology—and in the emerging haze, the shape of the tipping point becomes terrifyingly clear, for it is always the same shape.
