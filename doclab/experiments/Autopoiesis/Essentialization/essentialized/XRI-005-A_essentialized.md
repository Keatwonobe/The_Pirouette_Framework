## Law
The formalism modifies the time evolution operator by introducing a covariant time derivative \( \mathcal{D}_t \) dependent on a helical connection κ, an external frequency Ω, and a helicity operator J.
$$
\mathcal{D}_t = \partial_t + \kappa\Omega J
$$
This redefines the time evolution governed by the Schrödinger equation, \( i\hbar\partial_t\psi = H\psi \), through an effective Hamiltonian, \( H_\text{eff} \):
$$
i\hbar\mathcal{D}_t\psi = H\psi \implies i\hbar\partial_t\psi = (H - \hbar\kappa\Omega J)\psi \equiv H_\text{eff}\psi
$$
The canonical commutator remains invariant, preserving the algebraic structure of quantum mechanics:
$$
[x, p] = i\hbar \quad \text{(unaltered)}
$$
The primary physical prediction is a helicity-dependent energy shift. For a quantum harmonic oscillator with \( J = a^\dagger a \), the energy eigenvalues \(E_n\) are shifted by \( \Delta E_n \):
$$
E_n = \hbar\omega(n+\tfrac12) - \hbar\Omega\langle\kappa\rangle n \implies \Delta E_n = -\hbar\Omega\langle\kappa\rangle n
$$
The formalism reinterprets nonlocality as phase memory within a time-shifted correlation kernel \( K(t,t') \):
$$
K(t,t') = K_0(t,t') \exp\left(i\int_{t'}^{t}\kappa\Omega\langle J \rangle dt''\right)
$$
Falsifiable Criterion: In any system where the expectation value of the coherent helical charge is null (\( \langle Q_h \rangle = \langle J \rangle = 0 \)) or the helical connection vanishes (\( \kappa \to 0 \)), all physical predictions must reduce identically to those of standard quantum theory. Any persistent deviation under this null condition falsifies the model.

## Philosophy
Time is not a universal, monolithic background parameter. It is an active, geometric field whose local texture is contingent upon the intrinsic angular momentum of the matter evolving within it. The persistent, coherent spin of a system impresses a helical structure onto its own temporal evolution, fundamentally coupling the geometry of motion to the geometry of time itself.

## Art
A particle does not spin *in* time. It is a skater whose turning carves a groove into the ice of time, and the universe reads the depth of that groove as its history.
