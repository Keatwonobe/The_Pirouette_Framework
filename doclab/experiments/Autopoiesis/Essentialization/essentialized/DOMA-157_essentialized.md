## Law
The system's dynamics are described by the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p`, where the action is minimized for a narrative geodesic:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`
- `K_τ`: Kinetic Coherence. The internal, phase-locked energy of a narrative (`Ki`).
- `V_Γ`: Potential Pressure. The environmental friction and dissonant energy the narrative must overcome.

The central diagnostic is **Resonant Gain (G_R)**, which quantifies anomalous efficiency. It is the ratio of systemic impact to the energy of its causal seed.

`G_R = ΔKτ / Γ_inj`

**Observable Components:**
1.  **Coherence Flux (ΔKτ):** The change in `K_τ` representing the effect. It is measured as a qualitative state transition where multiple information domains (e.g., social, financial, political) achieve phase-locking into a unified Laminar Flow. This is the primary trigger event, an **Alchemical Union**.
2.  **Injection Pressure (Γ_inj):** The estimated energy of the narrative's initial injection, representing the cause. It is an inverse function of source obscurity, syndication concentration, and astroturfed amplification signals. A low `Γ_inj` corresponds to a minimal, low-visibility origin.

**Falsifiable Criterion:**
A narrative `Ki` is classified as manipulated if its formation yields a Resonant Gain significantly greater than unity (`G_R >> 1`). This is the **Red Flag: Anomalous Gain Confirmed**. The phenomenon is explained as a minimal energy nudge (`δΓ_inj`) pushing a prepared system over a "coherence cliff"—a state of high potential energy stored in a collective **Wound Channel**. The resulting cascade (`ΔKτ`) is a release of this stored potential, not a direct product of the injection's energy.

## Philosophy
The authenticity of a belief is not determined by its content but by its thermodynamic signature. Truth is not a static property of a statement, but a dynamic quality of its propagation. An organic idea has a metabolic trail; its effect in the world is proportional to the visible energy of its creation and transmission. Manipulation, conversely, reveals itself as a violation of this causal economy—a form of informational cold fusion that generates a universe of belief from a nearly undetectable seed. Therefore, the most fundamental act of discernment is not to ask "Is this true?" but rather, "Is the energy of this coherence honestly accounted for?"

## Art
Truth announces itself with the honest, clumsy chaos of a thrown stone. A lie is the silent, perfect ripple that spreads from a phantom touch.
