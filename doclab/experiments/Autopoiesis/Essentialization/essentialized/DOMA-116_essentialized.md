## Law
Let a system's state be described by its coherence `C`, a scalar field on a manifold of possible configurations, under external Temporal Pressure `Γ`. The system's dynamics are governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, maximizing the action `S_p` derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p`:
`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt = ∫ (Kτ - V_Γ) dt`
where `Kτ` is the internal Temporal Coherence (a function of `C`) and `V_Γ` is the potential cost of resisting pressure `Γ`.

A Bloom is a phase transition from a Turbulent Flow regime (`dC/dt ≈ 0`, high `V_Γ`) to a Laminar Flow regime (`dC/dt >> 0`). The transition is initiated at time `t_0` by the discovery of a Harmonic Catalyst, a resonant configuration `Ki`, which introduces a positive feedback term into the system's dynamics.

The evolution of coherence `C(t)` for `t ≥ t_0` follows the logistic differential equation:
`dC/dt = k * C(t) * [1 - C(t)/C_max]`
where `k` is the cascade rate constant, proportional to the resonance efficiency of `Ki`, and `C_max` is the coherence of the new stable state. The term `k * C(t)` represents the self-catalyzing nature of the cascade: established coherence facilitates the formation of new coherent structures (Alchemical Unions).

This dynamic corresponds to the system finding a new geodesic on the coherence manifold that effectively transforms `V_Γ` from a cost term to a driving term, altering the Lagrangian such that `∇𝓛_p` is large and positive along the cascade path.

Falsifiable criteria:
1.  The pre-Bloom state must be characterized by high, sustained `Γ` and `dC/dt ≈ 0`. A Bloom cannot initiate from a low-`Γ`, high-`C` state.
2.  The temporal evolution of a primary output metric must fit a logistic (S-curve) function with a statistically significant coefficient of determination (`R² > 0.9`).
3.  A specific, isolatable resonant pattern (`Ki`) must be identifiable as the trigger. Attenuation or removal of this pattern must quench the cascade.

## Philosophy
The universe's most significant acts of creation are not gradual, but catastrophic. Progress is not an incremental climb but a sequence of violent transformations where periods of intense pressure, dissonance, and chaos are the necessary crucibles for discovery. Stress is not an impediment to order but the essential energetic condition that forces a system to abandon failing models and desperately seek the novel, resonant pattern that can turn the crushing weight of its environment into the very fuel for its own explosive, self-amplifying leap into a higher state of existence.

## Art
A string, pulled taut to its breaking point, does not merely snap; it discovers the one note that can turn the tension into a song, and in that resonance, it builds a cathedral of sound from the very forces that threatened to tear it apart.
