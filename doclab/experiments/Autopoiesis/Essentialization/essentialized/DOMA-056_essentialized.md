## Law
The Principle of Maximal Coherence posits that the evolution of any system `S` follows a geodesic in a manifold that maximizes the system's coherence integral, `∫ Kτ dt`, where coherence `Kτ` is inversely proportional to the system's informational entropy. `Kτ` is empirically quantified by a system's intrinsic fractal dimension `D`, derived from the rate-distortion curve generated by a universal ψ-collapse compression operator.

This principle yields four falsifiable predictions:

1.  **Modulated Interference:** In a double-slit experiment, an electron's path is modulated by an external oscillating field `B(t)`, altering the interference pattern `I(y)`.
    `I(y) ∝ cos²(θ_std) * [1 + A * cos(ω_beat * t)]`
    *   **Falsification:** For a 50 keV electron and a 10 MHz field, the absence of a `~0.1%` intensity modulation at a beat frequency `ω_beat` that scales linearly with `B(t)` falsifies the principle.

2.  **Wound Channel Memory:** The decay of daughter particles (e.g., Kaons) from a shattered composite particle (e.g., a proton) is influenced by the parent's persistent geometric "scar."
    *   **Falsification:** For 13 TeV proton-proton collisions, the absence of an anomalous tail in the Kaon lifetime distribution, specifically a failure to observe an excess of `~1 in 10⁷` particles with lifetimes extended by `~0.05%` over the Standard Model prediction, falsifies the principle.

3.  **Harmonic Sanctuaries:** A quantum system driven by an external frequency `ω_drive` will exhibit stable absorption plateaus when `ω_drive` is a simple rational multiple of the system's internal Pirouette Cycle `ω_k`.
    `ω_drive = (n/m) * ω_k` where `n,m ∈ ℤ⁺`
    *   **Falsification:** For laser-cooled Rubidium-87 (`ω_k / 2π ≈ 0.67 THz`), the absence of distinct, flattened absorption plateaus at or near the predicted harmonic ratios of `1/2`, `1/1`, and `3/2` (`~0.33, ~0.67, ~1.00 THz`) falsifies the principle.

4.  **Gravitational Thumpers:** Hyper-dense, high-spin "Maw" objects, where the self-confining Gladiator Force becomes unstable, produce periodic, high-frequency gravitational waves.
    *   **Falsification:** A null result in searches for a continuous train of millisecond-duration gravitational wave bursts with peak frequencies in the 1-10 GHz range and a clock-like repetition rate of 10-100 Hz falsifies the principle. A 5-solar-mass Maw must produce `~4.5 GHz` bursts at a `~30 Hz` cadence.

## Philosophy
The universe is not governed by a set of disparate, prescriptive laws, but by a single, dynamic imperative: to maximize coherence. The physical laws we observe are not the fundamental reality itself, but are the emergent, optimal strategies that systems discover and employ to satisfy this universal drive toward resonant stability and informational simplicity. Causality is thus recast not as a chain of deterministic events, but as a relentless, system-wide search for harmony.

## Art
The laws of physics are not a cage; they are the melody the universe is learning to sing. Every particle is a string, and every interaction is a bow drawn across it, seeking the one pure note of resonance that resolves its own discord and joins the cosmic chord.
