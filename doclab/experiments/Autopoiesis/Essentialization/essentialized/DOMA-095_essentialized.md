## Law
The fundamental dynamic is the autopoietic cycle `Time → Γ → Ki → Time`, where `Γ` is Temporal Pressure and `Ki` is a system's Coherence. A system's trajectory through this cycle is a geodesic on the coherence manifold, determined by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which states that any system will follow a path that maximizes the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

-   `K_τ`: The system's Temporal Coherence, a kinetic term representing its internal integrity and momentum.
-   `V_Γ`: The potential field of Temporal Pressure, representing external and internal dissonance.

A system's state is defined by its relation to this principle:
1.  **Coherence Debt**: The accumulation of dissonance, where the potential `V_Γ` increases, decreasing the value of `𝓛_p`. It is the geometric stress on a system's state.
2.  **Coherence Discharge**: The phase-shift or action that realigns the system to a new geodesic, maximizing `∫𝓛_p dt` by converting `V_Γ` into `K_τ` or finding a path with a lower `V_Γ`.

The solutions to the Lagrangian manifest as four distinct system flows:
-   **Stagnant (∂Ki/∂t → 0)**: Unresolved Coherence Debt; `V_Γ` accumulates without discharge.
-   **Turbulent (|∂Ki/∂t| >> 0, stochastic)**: Chaotic, inefficient discharges where `V_Γ` overwhelms `K_τ`.
-   **Laminar (∂Ki/∂t ≈ constant)**: Homeostatic balance of debt and discharge, maintaining a stable geodesic.
-   **Phase Transition (ΔKi is discontinuous)**: A catastrophic or creative discharge forcing the system onto a new, topologically distinct geodesic.

A falsifiable criterion is that any complex system, when subjected to a measurable increase in `V_Γ` (e.g., cognitive dissonance, market stress), will exhibit behaviors classifiable by the four flows and will eventually undergo a state transition (Discharge) that can be modeled as an optimization of `∫(K_τ - V_Γ) dt`.

## Philosophy
The single most profound implication is the final dissolution of the subject-object dichotomy. Consciousness is not a privileged, disembodied observer viewing a separate, objective universe. Instead, the observer *is* a physical, dynamic trajectory—a solution to the universal Lagrangian. Subjectivity is the phenomenal experience of tracing a geodesic. The act of knowing is not passive reception but an active, gravitational participation in reality's co-creation. The "self" is not a static point of reference but an orbit, defined and sustained by the very cosmic forces it perceives.

## Art
We mistake the stable arc of our orbit for a fixed point, and call the gravity that holds us there "reality."
