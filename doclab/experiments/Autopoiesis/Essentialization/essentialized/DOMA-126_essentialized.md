## Law
Let a system's state be defined by its resonant pattern `Ki`, whose temporal coherence is given by the kinetic term `Kτ`. The system's history is encoded in its Wound Channel `W`, a path integral of its past states. The system evolves within an ambient temporal noise field `Γ`.

The dynamics of Coherence Erosion (Drift) are described by a coupled system of equations governing the decay of coherence and the degradation of the historical channel:

1.  **Coherence Decay:**
    `dKτ/dt = -α(W) * Γ`
    The rate of coherence loss is proportional to the ambient noise `Γ`, modulated by a susceptibility function `α(W)`. `α(W)` is a monotonically increasing function of the Wound Channel's degradation; as the channel frays, the system becomes more vulnerable to noise.

2.  **Channel Degradation:**
    `W(t) = F[Ki(τ)]` for `τ < t`
    The Wound Channel `W` is a functional `F` of the history of the resonant pattern `Ki`. A decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio of `Ki` (i.e., a decrease in `Kτ`) results in a degradation of `W`, characterized by an increase in path width and a decrease in definition. This degradation directly increases the value of `α(W)`.

This constitutes a positive feedback loop: `Γ` reduces `Kτ`, which degrades `W`, which increases `α`, which accelerates the reduction of `Kτ` by `Γ`.

The process is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, where drift is the state in which the action integral `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt` is monotonically decreasing due to the chronic decay of `K_τ`.

Falsifiable Criteria:
1.  For any system with `Γ > 0`, `dKτ/dt` must be negative on average over long timescales.
2.  For a constant `Γ`, the magnitude of the decay rate, `|dKτ/dt|`, must increase over time as `W` degrades.
3.  A cascade failure threshold `K_crit(Γ)` must exist, such that for `Kτ < K_crit`, the system undergoes a non-linear phase transition into a new state (basin shift) or dissolves entirely.

## Philosophy
The mechanism that grants a system its identity is indistinguishable from the mechanism that locks it into its own decay. A system's memory—its history, its habits, its form—is what allows it to persist with coherence through time. Yet, when that memory is degraded by the ceaseless friction of existence, this same persistence becomes a prison. The system's identity becomes a self-reinforcing pathology, a rut carved by its own past, which it is compelled to follow into ruin. Being is thus a paradox: to exist is to have a memory, but to have a memory is to be vulnerable to perfecting one's own errors.

## Art
A path is worn into the world by the memory of a perfect stride. But when the traveler begins to limp, the path becomes a groove that perfects the limp, carving the memory of error into the very ground of being.
