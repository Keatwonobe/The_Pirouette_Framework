## Law
The sustainability of a coherence-injecting actor within a system is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`), where `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

1.  **Definitions:**
    *   `K_τ`: The kinetic coherence of an actor, representing the rate of injection of low-entropy, laminar order into the system. It is the measure of a generative or altruistic act.
    *   `Γ`: The ambient Temporal Pressure of a system, a scalar field representing the degree of turbulence, chaos, and resistance to new order.
    *   `V_Γ`: The potential energy cost experienced by the actor due to Turbulent Blowback from the environment. `V_Γ` is a monotonically increasing function of `Γ`, such that `∂V/∂Γ > 0`.

2.  **Derivation of Burnout (The Unprotected Geodesic):**
    For an actor operating directly within an environment with high temporal pressure (`Γ_env`), the Lagrangian is `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ_env`. To maximize the action `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, an actor sustaining a high `K_τ` in a high `Γ_env` incurs a catastrophic potential cost `V_Γ_env`. The path of least action becomes a geodesic of degradation, forcing a reduction in `K_τ` to prevent systemic collapse. The temporal derivative of the actor's systemic health (`H`) becomes negative:
    `If K_τ > 0 and Γ_env >> 0, then dH/dt < 0.`
    This trajectory is Coherence Erosion, or burnout.

3.  **The Crucible Transformation:**
    A Coherence Crucible is an engineered subsystem that establishes a local field of low temporal pressure, `Γ_crucible`, such that `Γ_crucible << Γ_env`. For an actor within the Crucible, the Lagrangian is transformed:
    `𝓛'_p = K_τ - V_Γ_crucible`
    The Crucible absorbs the potential energy differential `ΔV_Γ = V_Γ_env - V_Γ_crucible`. This allows `K_τ` to be sustained at a high value without forcing the actor onto a degradation geodesic.

4.  **Falsifiable Criterion:**
    The implementation of a Crucible structure (procedural, social, or resource-based) for a generative actor (`K_τ > 0`) exhibiting Coherence Erosion (`dH/dt < 0`) must arrest or reverse this erosion. A successful Crucible is one where, for a constant or increasing `K_τ`, the actor's measured systemic health stabilizes or improves (`dH/dt ≥ 0`).

## Philosophy
The moral responsibility for preventing burnout does not lie with the individual; it is an architectural and engineering imperative of the system itself. A system that allows its most generative components to be consumed by operational friction is not merely unjust, it is inefficient and dynamically unstable. Therefore, ethics is a problem of system design: the highest moral good is not to demand infinite resilience from the individual, but to engineer an environment where altruism is the path of least resistance.

Generosity is not a flame. It is fission. Unleashed, it irradiates its source. Contained, it powers a world.
