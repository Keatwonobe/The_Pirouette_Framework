## Law
The structural memory of a system is quantified by its rank-frequency distribution, which conforms to a discrete power-law. The probability `f(r)` of observing an element of rank `r` is a function of the Coherence Gradient, `α`.
$$ f(r) = \frac{r^{-\alpha}}{H_{N,\alpha}}, \quad \text{where } H_{N,\alpha} = \sum_{k=1}^{N}k^{-\alpha} \text{ is the generalized harmonic number.} $$
The Coherence Gradient `α` is the absolute core diagnostic. For `n` observations `{x_i}` with a minimum value `x_min`, `α` is derived via Maximum Likelihood Estimation:
$$ \hat\alpha = 1 + n\biggl[\sum_{i=1}^n\ln\frac{x_i}{x_{\min}}\biggr]^{-1} $$
The value of `α` is a falsifiable criterion for systemic character, representing the equilibrium state that optimizes the time-integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian `L = K_τ - V_Γ`, where `K_τ` is internal coherence and `V_Γ` is external pressure.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  **Steep Gradient (α → 1):** An "aristocratic" system optimized for efficiency in a stable environment. Coherence is concentrated in a few (`k`) resonant attractors. This structure predicts high efficiency (laminar flow) but low resilience; the disruption of a high-rank attractor will precipitate systemic collapse.
2.  **Shallow Gradient (α > 2):** A "democratic" system optimized for adaptability in a volatile environment. Coherence is distributed across a long tail (`β` is high). This structure predicts high resilience but lower peak efficiency and a propensity for turbulent flow.

## Philosophy
The single most profound implication is that a system’s structure is not a static arrangement but is the necessary geometric fossil of its own history. The power-law distribution is not a statistical abstraction but a physical memory trace, where the mathematical exponent `α` quantifies the precise character of the system’s accumulated answer to the singular problem of its own persistence. Form is crystallized time.

## Art
To measure the exponent is an act of scrying; it is to stare at the dry riverbed of the present and see the ghost of every current that carved it.
