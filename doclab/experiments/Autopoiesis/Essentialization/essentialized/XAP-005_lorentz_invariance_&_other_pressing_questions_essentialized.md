## Law
The framework's primary assertion is the emergence of spacetime geometry and its associated symmetries from a substrate action, \(S_p\), defined over a parameter \(\tau\) and dependent on complex coherence fields \(Ki\) and a scalar field \(\Gamma\). Lorentz invariance is not postulated but derived.

1.  **Metric Emergence:** The spacetime metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\) is defined by the second variation of the cycle-averaged action:
    \[
    g_{\mu\nu} = \langle \partial_\mu\Gamma\,\partial_\nu\Gamma - \partial_\mu Ki\,\partial_\nu Ki^{*} \rangle_\tau
    \]
    The Lorentz group \(\mathrm{SO}(1,3)\) is the isometry group of this emergent metric, whose (1,3) signature is a consequence of the eikonal bound (DYNA-004).

2.  **Invariant Speed:** Perturbations \(\delta Ki\) propagate according to a wave equation where the invariant speed \(c\) is a function of the \(\Gamma\) field's potential, not a universal constant:
    \[
    \frac{\partial^2\delta Ki}{\partial t^2} - c^2(\Gamma)\nabla^2\delta Ki = 0, \quad \text{where} \quad c^2(\Gamma) = \frac{\partial^2V_\Gamma}{\partial(\partial_i\Gamma)\,\partial(\partial_i\Gamma)}
    \]

3.  **Dynamic Spin Selection:** Particle spin is not an intrinsic, postulated property but the result of energy minimization on the coherence manifold. For a spherical manifold, eigen-energies scale as \(E_n \propto n^2-n+\frac{1}{4}\). The global energy minimum occurs at \(n=½\), dynamically selecting spin-½ as the ground state.

4.  **Falsifiable Criterion:** The framework predicts a specific correction to the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons, scaling with the lepton mass \(m_\ell\). This correction arises from wound-channel torsion in the \(\Gamma\)-sector.
    \[
    \Delta a_\ell^{(\Gamma)} = \kappa \left( \frac{m_\ell}{m_e} \right)^p \left( \frac{\alpha}{\pi} \right)^3, \quad \text{with} \quad p = 1+2\Delta \approx 2
    \]
    This yields a testable prediction for the tau lepton: \(\Delta a_\tau^{(\Gamma)} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{-6}\). A null result at forthcoming experiments would falsify the model's \(\Gamma\)-sector coupling.

## Philosophy
The laws of physics are not immutable axioms imposed upon the universe. They are the emergent, large-scale symmetries and dynamically-selected ground states of a more fundamental, time-ordered substrate. What we perceive as immutable law is merely the most stable and symmetric configuration of an underlying process, much as the rigid laws of crystallography are an emergent consequence of minimizing energy in a fluid of atoms.

## Art
The universe is not a machine built from a blueprint; it is the crystal that precipitates from the cooling of time.
