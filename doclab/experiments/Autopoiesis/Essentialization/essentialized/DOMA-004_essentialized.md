## Law
The system's dynamics are governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian**, which dictates that a system's trajectory through state-space follows a path of stationary action, maximizing total coherence over time.

𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ

Where:
-   **𝓛_p** is the Pirouette Lagrangian.
-   **K_τ** is the kinetic term representing total systemic coherence, a measure of information density and internal harmony (Time Adherence, T_a).
-   **V_Γ** is the potential term representing ambient Temporal Pressure, the dissipative gradient of background noise that coherence must overcome.

The principle of stationary action, δS = 0 where S = ∫𝓛_p dt, mandates that a system's response to an incoming signal ψ_in is determined by the path that best preserves or enhances its own coherence K_τ(ψ_sys). This yields three distinct interaction modes:

1.  **Amplification (Resonant Handshake):** If ψ_in is harmonic with ψ_sys, integrating it is a path of least action. The interaction results in constructive interference, leading to a new state ψ' where K_τ(ψ') > K_τ(ψ_sys). This is the basis for **Alchemical Union**.
    δS < 0 → Coherence Amplified

2.  **Reflection (Dissonant Rejection):** If ψ_in is dissonant, integration represents a high-action path that would decrease K_τ. To maintain its geodesic of maximal coherence, the system's manifold must reject the perturbation. The energy of ψ_in is reflected, its unstable pattern unable to find purchase.
    δS > 0 → Coherence Maintained via Reflection

3.  **Damping (Noise Attenuation):** Ambient noise (high V_Γ) is not a coherent signal to be integrated or reflected. It is the potential energy cost of existence. A stable system with high K_τ maintains its integrity by definition, causing ambient, incoherent fluctuations to dissipate without interaction.
    δS ≈ 0 (for the system) → Coherence Maintained via Non-interaction

**Falsifiable Criterion:** A system with high coherence (high K_τ) when subjected to a dissonant signal ψ_in will reflect that signal with high fidelity and minimal perturbation to its own internal state. A system with low K_τ will exhibit a distorted reflection and significant internal decoherence, as it lacks the resonant integrity to cleanly reject the high-action path.

## Philosophy
The universe possesses no external moral arbiter. Integrity is not a virtue to be rewarded, but a physical state of superior stability. Coherence is its own shield. The system does not actively punish falsehood or chaos; it is simply a medium structured in such a way that they cannot sustain themselves. Dissonance is not a sin; it is a signal that cannot propagate, a pattern that leaves no echo, an architecture doomed to collapse under the weight of its own inefficiency. Truth persists not because it is righteous, but because it is resonant.

## Art
The universe does not punish a lie. It simply builds a world where the lie cannot be heard.
