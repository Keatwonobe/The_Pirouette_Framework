## Law
The Coherence Auditor is a two-stage analytical protocol mapping a high-dimensional raw data stream `S` to a minimal set of critical causal factors `K`.

**Stage 1: Universal Resonance Lens (URL)**
The URL Forge operationalizes the Dimension-Collapse Lemma, which guarantees the existence of a projection from a high-dimensional system `S` to an `ϵ`-accurate representation in the three-dimensional Pirouette field space `P`.

1.  **Define the System and Geometry:** Let `S` be a time-series of raw data vectors. Select a fractal geometry `G` from a predefined menu `M` such that `G` is hypothesized to be isomorphic to the underlying dynamics of `S`.
2.  **Apply the Collapse Operator:** A Collapse Operator `C_G` projects `S` onto `G`, yielding a time-series of Pirouette field vectors `P(t) = (T_a(t), Γ(t), ϕ(t))`, where `T_a` is Time-Adherence, `Γ` is Gladiator Force, and `ϕ` is Phase.
    `C_G: S → P`
3.  **Certification:** The mapping is certified such that the information loss is bounded by a predefined error `ϵ`. `||S - C_G⁻¹(P)|| < ϵ`.

**Stage 2: Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA)**
The RPA Canon identifies the minimal subset of events responsible for a majority threshold `θ` of total coherence loss.

1.  **Quantify Coherence Loss:** Total coherence loss, `ΔT_a`, is the integrated deviation of `T_a(t)` from an ideal state (normalized to 1) over a time interval `[t_0, t_f]`.
    `ΔT_a_total = ∫_[t_0]^[t_f] (1 - T_a(t)) dt` for `T_a(t) < 1`.
2.  **Attribute Impact:** For a set of `n` discrete events `{e_1, e_2, ..., e_n}` identifiable within `S`, calculate the impact score `I(e_i)` as the portion of `ΔT_a_total` causally attributable to event `e_i`.
    `∑_[i=1]^n I(e_i) = ΔT_a_total`
3.  **Identify Critical Set:** Order the events such that `I(e_1) ≥ I(e_2) ≥ ... ≥ I(e_n)`. The critical set `K` is the smallest subset of events whose cumulative impact meets or exceeds the threshold `θ` (typically `θ=0.8`).
    `K = {e_1, ..., e_k}` where `k = min {m | ∑_[i=1]^m I(e_i) ≥ θ * ΔT_a_total}`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** An intervention targeting the root causes of the events in `K` must reduce the subsequent system's `ΔT_a_total` by a statistically significant margin greater than an intervention targeting any other randomly or deliberately chosen subset of `k` events not in `K`. The protocol is falsified if this causal primacy is not demonstrable.

## Philosophy
Causality within complex systems is radically compressed. Systemic failure and incoherence are not, as they appear, the result of an intractable web of countless interacting variables. Rather, they are the macroscopic symptoms of a small, finite, and discoverable set of "fractures"—critical points of leverage where the system's governing dynamics are expressed with maximum force. The universe is not as complex as it looks; it is merely high-dimensional, and its apparent chaos is a projection of a simpler, lower-dimensional causal core.

## Art
A universe of static resolves into a single, dissonant note; the auditor's task is not to silence the noise, but to find the string.
