## Law
The state of Flow is defined as isochronous temporal resonance between an agent and its environment. It occurs when the agent traverses a geodesic—a path of least action—within a local coherence manifold.

Let the agent's internal perception-action cycle be characterized by a frequency ω_agent, and the dominant temporal rhythm of the environment's information flux be ω_env. The phase difference between the agent and the environment at time *t* is given by τ(t).

The core condition for Flow is the minimization of phase desynchronization, expressed as the near-zeroing of the rate of change of the phase difference:
$$
\frac{d\tau}{dt} \approx 0 \implies \omega_{\text{agent}} \approx \omega_{\text{env}}
$$
This state of resonance corresponds to the macroscopic psychological equilibrium between environmental challenge (ΔT_env) and agent skill (ΔT_agent), where:
$$
\Delta T_{\text{env}} = \Delta T_{\text{agent}}
$$
This formalism yields three primary falsifiable criteria for a given state:
1.  **Phase-Lock Failure:** A state is not Flow if the temporal desynchronization |Δτ| is significantly non-zero and variant.
2.  **Manifold Instability:** A state is not Flow if the temporal pressure variance, σ_T (the stability of ΔT_env), is high, indicating a turbulent, non-geodesic path.
3.  **Energetic Inefficiency:** A state is not Flow if the coherence flux, Φ_C, which measures the metabolic efficiency of the information cycle, is significantly below its theoretical maximum.

## Philosophy
The highest form of agency is not an act of willful control but a state of total submission. Flow demonstrates that peak performance arises when the boundary between self and world collapses. In this resonant state, action is not "chosen" by an independent ego imposing its will upon reality; rather, action becomes the inevitable, frictionless expression of the unified agent-environment system. The self ceases to be a commander and becomes a perfect conduit, experiencing its own effortless actions as if they were a fundamental force of nature.

The master does not strike the bell. She becomes the silence between the peals, and the world rings through her.
