## Law
The rehabilitation of a system is defined as a trajectory in a three-dimensional state space described by the vector `S(t) = [Kτ, Γ, Tₐ]`, where:
- `Kτ ∈ [0, 1]` is the Coherence Potential, a measure of systemic stability and function.
- `Γ ∈ [0, 1]` is the Temporal Pressure, a measure of aggregate physiological and psychological stress.
- `Tₐ ∈ [0, 1]` is the Time Adherence, a measure of volitional engagement with the recovery protocol.

The initial state is `S₀ = [Kτ₀, Γ₀, Tₐ₀]`, typically characterized by low `Kτ` and `Tₐ` and high `Γ`. The objective is to reach a terminal "Laminar" state `S_f` defined by the boundary condition: `(Γ < 0.3) ∧ (Tₐ ≥ 0.8)` sustained for a period `t ≥ 4 weeks`.

The total Temporal Pressure `Γ` is a computable sum of a baseline stressor load `Γ_base` and a set of additive modifiers `ΔΓ_i`:
`Γ = Γ_base + ΣΔΓ_i`
where `ΔΓ_i` are empirically derived constants for conditions such as Opioid Dependence (+0.3) or Immunosuppression (+0.2).

The dynamics are governed by a discrete-time control system:
`S_{n+1} = f(S_n, P_n)`
where `n` is the time step (e.g., one week) and `P_n` is the Pirouette Prescription, a set of interventions (hormetic stress, `Antidote Stack`) designed to produce the state transition `S_n → S_{n+1}` such that `ΔKτ > 0` and `ΔΓ < 0`.

The core of the Caduceus Lens protocol is the decomposition of the system into two coupled sub-states: the physiological (`S_B`, Body蛇) and the volitional (`S_W`, Will蛇). Coherent recovery (`dKτ/dt > 0`) is contingent upon the synchronization of these sub-states. Phase advancement is gated by the convergence criterion:
`||S_B(t) - S_W(t)|| < ε`
where `ε` is a predefined threshold (e.g., `Δ0.1` variance).

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The protocol is falsified if, for a statistically significant cohort, the application of the prescribed intervention sequence `P_n` corresponding to the Rehabilitation Gauge phases fails to drive the state vector `S(t)` into the Laminar Certification region within a protocol-defined maximum timeframe `t_max`.

## Philosophy
The single most profound implication is that healing is not the external repair of a passive object, but the sovereign act of a will re-composing its own physiological reality. The framework mathematically asserts that stress (`Γ`) applied without the synchronized consent of the will (`Tₐ`) does not produce coherence (`Kτ`). Therefore, the formal distinction between a therapeutic intervention and an act of systemic violence lies not in the nature of the applied stress, but solely in whether the subject’s will is an integrated, consenting, and computationally necessary variable in the equation of recovery.

## Art
The self is a cracked bell. Trauma is not the crack, but the discordant noise that follows. Healing is not a mending of the flaw, but the will learning to strike the bell in such a way that the crack itself sings a new and resonant chord.
