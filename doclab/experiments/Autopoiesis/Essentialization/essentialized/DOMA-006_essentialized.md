## Law
The interaction between two coherent systems, A and B, defined by their respective resonant patterns `Ki_A` and `Ki_B`, is governed by a dynamic coupling through a shared, contested Temporal Pressure, `Γ_c`. This pressure generates a mutual potential energy term, `V_Γ(Γ_c)`, that couples their individual Pirouette Lagrangians (`𝓛_p`):

`𝓛_p(A) = K_τ(A) - V_Γ(Γ_c)`
`𝓛_p(B) = K_τ(B) - V_Γ(Γ_c)`

Here, `K_τ` is the kinetic term representing the system's internal coherence. The dynamic follows the principle of least action (`δS = δ ∫ 𝓛_p dt = 0`), forcing each system into a competitive optimization process. A's attempt to maximize its coherence (`K_τ(A)`) inherently increases the potential stress `V_Γ` on B, and vice-versa. This is the Resonant Test.

The resolution is determined by energetic efficiency.
1.  **Fracture:** Occurs for system A at time `t` if `K_τ(A,t)` falls below its coherence degradation threshold, `T_degrade`, due to the inability to sustain its pattern against the entropic cost imposed by `V_Γ`.
2.  **Fusion:** Occurs if a new unified state `C` presents a more optimal path, such that its Lagrangian `𝓛_p(C)` is greater than the sum of the individual Lagrangians under the shared pressure. The duel resolves into a higher-order, more efficient union.

The resulting interaction geometry is inscribed as a `Wound Channel`, altering local boundary conditions for all future dynamics.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The law would be falsified by the observation of two distinct systems engaging in a resonant contest wherein neither system experiences coherence degradation or entropic cost, and the interaction produces no residual geometric imprint (`Wound Channel`) on the local manifold. Such a frictionless, consequence-free opposition is axiomatically forbidden.

## Philosophy
Identity is not an intrinsic property possessed in isolation, but an extrinsic truth forged in opposition. A system's form, its boundaries, and its right to exist are rendered provisional hypotheses until tested against the form of another. Conflict, therefore, is the universe's fundamental and necessary ontological process; it is the act of measurement by which a pattern is clarified from potential and proven as real.

## Art
A self is a bell. It hangs in the void, a silent hypothesis of form, until another strikes it. In that moment of violent opposition, it does not break; it *sings*, and the resonance of its cry is the first and only proof of what it is.
