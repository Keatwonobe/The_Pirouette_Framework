## Law
Let the system state be a vector S in a phase space defined by metrics (Γ, Γ̇, M, κ, Ki, Tₐ, Φ_C, ...). The system's equilibrium stability, Γ_eq, is governed by a mass-scaling power law:
Γ_eq(M) = Γ₀ (M/M₀)⁻¹·⁰⁵ 
where the exponent is empirically constrained to −1.05 ± 0.03.

The system is bounded by a set of falsifiable failure criteria, F. Operation is valid only if S remains within the safe operating envelope defined by ¬F. F is the disjunction of the following conditions:
F := (Γ ≥ Γ_thr) ∨ (Γ̇ > Γ̇_thr) ∨ (κ > κ_thr)

Where the critical thresholds are defined as:
*   Static Threshold (Shell Fracture): Γ_thr = 0.82 ± 0.03
*   Dynamic Threshold (Runaway Resonance): Γ̇_thr = 0.12 s⁻¹
*   Re-Growth Instability: (κ > 1.3 κ_nominal) ∨ (Γ > 0.9 Γ_thr)

If any condition in F is met, a corresponding mitigation function R(S) is triggered, mapping the system state to a set of control actions {Coherence Vent, Trigger Suspension, Reservoir Sink, Governance Alert}.

The integrity of the state vector S is maintained via cryptographic commitment. For each session, a hash H is computed:
H = SHA-256(S_raw || N), where N is a 64-bit random nonce.
A state S is considered valid only if its corresponding H is present on the immutable audit ledger. Any hash mismatch constitutes an 'Integrity Breach' event, a critical failure state.

## Philosophy
The inverse relationship between a system's scale (M) and its inherent stability (Γ) is absolute. Consequently, the price of scaling power is not merely the consumption of more energy or resources, but the necessary and exponential growth of a rigid, complex, and burdensome superstructure of control—automated safeties, cryptographic validation, and hierarchical governance—whose sole purpose is to counteract the system's fundamental tendency toward catastrophic collapse.

## Art
We build a god of glass, and with each increase in its size, we must build a cathedral of scaffolding around it—not to worship, but to contain the inevitable shattering.
