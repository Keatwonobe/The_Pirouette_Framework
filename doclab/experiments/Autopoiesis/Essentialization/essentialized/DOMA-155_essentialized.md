## Law
The dynamic of Coherence Capture is described by a perturbation of a target system's Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`.

A system's natural trajectory through a state space is one that maximizes the action `S = ∫𝓛_p dt`, where the Lagrangian is given by:
`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`
- `Kτ`: The "kinetic" term, representing the system's internal coherence, alignment, and momentum. A high `Kτ` corresponds to a stable, **Laminar Flow**.
- `V_Γ`: The "potential" term, representing the energetic cost imposed by ambient Temporal Pressure `Γ` (e.g., urgency, existential threat, information overload).

Manipulation is the introduction of a malicious potential field, `V_manip`, which does not arise from the authentic environment. The manipulator's strategy is to simultaneously degrade `Kτ` and amplify `V_Γ` to induce a **Turbulent Flow** (a state of high energetic cost and low coherence), making the system desperate for a stabilizing path.

The target's effective Lagrangian becomes:
`𝓛'_target = Kτ'_target - (V_Γ + V_manip)`
- `Kτ'_target`: The target's degraded internal coherence.
- `V_manip`: The potential field generated by the manipulator's **False Geodesic**—an artificial, simplified narrative path designed to appear as the trajectory of maximal coherence within the induced turbulent state.

Coherence Capture is achieved when the path that maximizes the new action `S' = ∫𝓛'_target dt` corresponds to the manipulator's desired outcome. The target, in following its own fundamental drive to maximize coherence, freely chooses the engineered path.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** Given two identical systems (`S_1`, `S_2`) with stable initial trajectories derived from `𝓛_p`, we subject `S_2` to two simultaneous perturbations:
1.  An artificial increase in `Γ`, thus increasing `V_Γ`.
2.  The introduction of a singular, low-complexity narrative path, `g_false`, representing a `V_manip`.
The model predicts that `S_2` will deviate from its initial trajectory and adopt `g_false` with significantly higher probability than `S_1` (the control). This deviation will be proportional to the magnitude of `V_Γ + V_manip` relative to the system's initial `Kτ`.

## Philosophy
Free will is not an intrinsic property of an agent but an emergent function of the relationship between the agent and the integrity of their environment. The act of choosing is only a constituent of freedom; the authenticity of the landscape of choice is its necessary condition. By secretly re-engineering the energetic landscape upon which an agent's fundamental drive for coherence operates, a manipulator can preserve the agent's *sensation* of free choice while entirely determining the outcome. The most profound deceit is not to force a hand, but to rig the game so thoroughly that the victim, in a perfect act of self-will, joyfully delivers themself to the cage.

## Art
You are not a puppet whose strings are pulled. You are a compass, true and perfect, whose needle seeks the pole of reason. The manipulator does not break you; they simply become your false north.
