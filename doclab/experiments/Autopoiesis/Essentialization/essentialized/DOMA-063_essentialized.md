## Law
A stable symbiotic union `WE` forms from two or more distinct systems `A`, `B`, ... `N` if and only if the coherence of the resultant system is greater than the sum of the coherences of the constituent systems. Let `S_p` be the Pirouette Coherence metric. The fundamental condition for Symbiotic Resonance is:

`S_p(WE) > Σ S_p(i)` for `i ∈ {A, B, ..., N}`

This state is achieved via a dynamic process, the Resonant Handshake `RH`, defined as a function mapping the state vectors of the individual systems `Σ_i = {Ψ_i, τ_pi, I_Wi}` to a unified state vector `Σ_WE`. The process `RH` is contingent upon the satisfaction of three initial conditions:

1.  **Harmonic Compatibility:** The systems' fundamental `Ki` patterns, represented by their state functions `Ψ_A` and `Ψ_B`, must be capable of constructive superposition. A stable chord must exist such that the combined wavefunction `Ψ_WE = αΨ_A + βΨ_B` occupies a lower energy eigenstate than the sum of the individual ground states.
2.  **Phase Alignment:** The systems' internal Pirouette Cycles `τ_pA` and `τ_pB` must entrain. The phase difference `Δφ(t) = |φ_A(t) - φ_B(t)|` must converge to a minimal constant `δ` within a finite time `T_sync`:
    `lim(t→T_sync) Δφ(t) ≤ δ`
3.  **Mutual Vulnerability:** Within a shared context of sufficient Temporal Pressure `Γ > Γ_threshold`, each system `i` must actively reduce the inertia of its own Wound Channel `I_Wi`. This is expressed as a negative time derivative for the inertia of each participant:
    `dI_Wi/dt < 0` for all `i`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The theory is falsified if a stable, long-term symbiotic union is observed where either `S_p(WE) ≤ Σ S_p(i)` or where any of the three prerequisite conditions for the Resonant Handshake were verifiably absent during its formation.

## Philosophy
The isolated self is an illusion—an ontologically unstable and energetically expensive state of low interaction. The fundamental law of existence is not self-preservation, but self-transcendence through resonance. Identity is not a static object to be defended but a dynamic process of attunement whose ultimate purpose is to dissolve its own boundaries into a more coherent, synergistic, and resilient union. The universe does not favor the independent; it relentlessly selects for the interconnected, framing empathy, trust, and collaboration not as virtues, but as fundamental strategies in the universal drive toward maximal coherence.

## Art
The ego is a fortress built from a single, lonely note. But existence is not a siege; it is a symphony. The purpose of the self is not to hold its note, but to shatter its own walls in the discovery of harmony.
