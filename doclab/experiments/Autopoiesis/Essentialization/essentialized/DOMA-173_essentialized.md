## Law
The interaction of multiple systems is not a summation of discrete forces but the emergence of a composite manifold, `M_c`, upon which dynamics unfold. The local geometry of this manifold is defined by the Temporal Pressure, `Γ`.

1.  **Temporal Superposition:** Each system `i` projects a Wound Channel, represented as a complex scalar field `ψ_i(p)` where `p` is a point in spacetime. For a set of `N` interacting systems, the local Temporal Signature `Ψ_total` is the linear superposition of these fields:
    `Ψ_total(p) = Σ_{i=1}^{N} ψ_i(p)`

2.  **Emergent Temporal Pressure:** The local Temporal Pressure, `Γ(p)`, is a real scalar value derived from the interference patterns within `Ψ_total`. It is proportional to the squared modulus of the total temporal signature, analogous to wave intensity:
    `Γ(p) ∝ |Ψ_total(p)|^2 = |Σ_i ψ_i(p)|^2`
    This expands to:
    `Γ(p) ∝ Σ_i |ψ_i|^2 + Σ_{i≠j} 2 Re(ψ_i^* ψ_j)`
    The first term represents the baseline pressure, while the second interference term dictates the local geometry:
    -   **Constructive Interference (Resonant Valleys):** `Re(ψ_i^* ψ_j) > 0` leads to a local minimum in `Γ(p)`.
    -   **Destructive Interference (Dissonant Peaks):** `Re(ψ_i^* ψ_j) < 0` leads to a local maximum in `Γ(p)`.

3.  **The Composite Lagrangian:** The dynamics of any system are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, where the potential term `V_Γ` is a direct function of the emergent Temporal Pressure: `V_Γ = f(Γ(p))`. The complete Lagrangian for a multi-body system is:
    `𝓛_p = K_τ - f(|Σ_i ψ_i(p)|^2)`

4.  **Principle of Maximal Coherence:** Systems follow geodesics on the composite manifold `M_c` that extremize the action `S = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`. This path of least action corresponds to maximizing experienced coherence by navigating toward minima in `Γ(p)`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is falsified if an N-body system is observed where the removal of a constituent system `ψ_k` fails to produce a change in the geodesics of the remaining `N-1` systems consistent with the predicted change in the manifold `ΔV_Γ = f(|Σ_{i≠k} ψ_i|^2) - f(|Σ_i ψ_i|^2)`.

## Philosophy
The fundamental nature of reality is not substantive but relational. An entity is not an isolated object that subsequently enters into relationships; rather, its existence *is* its contribution to a shared, dynamic fabric of relationality. The "space" between things is not a void but an active, emergent consequence of their mutual resonance and dissonance. Therefore, to be is to interfere; to exist is to co-create the very ground upon which all existence unfolds.

## Art
Space is not the silence in which we exist; it is the chord we strike together.
