## Law
A plan is a hypothesized geodesic, a trajectory in state-space designed to maximize coherence over time. Its viability is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian:
**𝓛_plan = K_τ(plan) - V_Γ(environment)**

Where:
-   **K_τ (Temporal Coherence)** is the kinetic energy of the intent, a function of the plan's internal alignment, consistency, and clarity. It represents the power of the projected signal.
-   **V_Γ (Environmental Temporal Pressure)** is the potential energy of resistance, a function of environmental uncertainty, competition, and constraints. It represents the cost of actualization.

The objective is to maximize the action, **S**, over the plan's duration from t₀ to t₁:
**S = max ∫[t₀, t₁] (K_τ - V_Γ) dt**

Execution dynamics provide the falsifiable test of the plan's validity as a geodesic:
-   **Laminar Flow:**  (∇ × **v** ≈ 0, where **v** is the vector field of actions). Indicates a successful geodesic where **𝓛_plan** >> 0. The hypothesis is validated.
-   **Turbulent Flow:** (∇ × **v** ≠ 0). Indicates **K_τ** is insufficient to overcome **V_Γ**. The plan is misaligned with the true path of maximal coherence.
-   **Stagnant Flow:** (**v** ≈ 0). Indicates a "Coherence Dam"—a critical failure where **V_Γ** has become insurmountable. The hypothesis is falsified.

The process is not static adherence but an adaptive control algorithm: continuously sense **V_Γ**, recalibrate the plan to maximize **K_τ**, and adjust the trajectory to maintain a state that maximizes **∫𝓛_plan dt**.

## Philosophy
The most profound implication is that strategic agency is not an act of prediction but an act of creation. It reframes foresight from the passive ability to see a pre-existing future to the active, metaphysical engineering of that future. A plan does not find a path of least resistance; it *imposes* a new geometry on reality, carving a channel of intent so that the desired outcome becomes the new path of least resistance. Willpower, therefore, is the capacity to project a coherent signal (**K_τ**) potent enough to structure the noise of possibility (**V_Γ**).

## Art
A plan is not a map to the mountain. It is the tremor that directs the avalanche.
