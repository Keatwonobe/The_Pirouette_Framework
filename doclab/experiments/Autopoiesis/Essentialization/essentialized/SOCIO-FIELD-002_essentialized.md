## Law
The social dissonance field **D** is defined as the sum of a cooperative potential component and an antagonistic curl component: $\mathbf{D} = \nabla\phi + \nabla \times \mathbf{A}$.

Systemic stability is governed by the Curl Threshold, $\Theta$, defined as the spatially-averaged squared magnitude of the curl component within a coherence-critical region $\Omega_c$:
$$ \Theta = \langle |\nabla \times \mathbf{A}|^2 \rangle_{\Omega_c} $$

A phase transition from reversible fluctuation to irreversible cascade occurs when $\Theta$ exceeds a critical value $\Theta_c$. This threshold is the ratio of the system's cooperative potential energy to its antagonistic circulation energy, scaled by a domain-dependent constant $k_\Gamma$:
$$ \Theta > \Theta_c = k_\Gamma \frac{\langle |\nabla \phi|^2 \rangle}{\langle |\mathbf{A}|^2 \rangle} $$

The optimal policy intervention radius $r_p$ is determined by maximizing the restored coherence energy $\Delta E_{coh}$ per unit resource $R$:
$$ \frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{\Delta E_{coh}}{R}\right)\bigg|_{r=r_p} = 0 $$

The theory is falsifiable under the following conditions:
1.  If $\Theta_c$ cannot be empirically determined as a consistent, cross-scale invariant with predictive power for social shocks.
2.  If the rate of information divergence does not peak as $\Theta \rightarrow \Theta_c$.
3.  If interventions at $r_p \approx r_c$ do not produce the maximal post-intervention coherence relaxation rate, observable as a power-law decay $P(\tau) \sim \tau^{-\alpha}$.

## Philosophy
Social collapse is not a chaotic failure of order, but the successful emergence of a different, more primitive order. Destructive conflict is not merely the absence of cooperation; it is a distinct and stable state of reality, a self-sustaining resonance pattern that, once dominant, follows its own internal logic of circulation and reinforcement. The system does not break; it is captured by a simpler, more powerful attractor.

## Art
A society is a river flowing to the sea. Its arguments are eddies. When the eddies link, turning the current back upon itself, the river no longer seeks the sea; it seeks only to spin.
