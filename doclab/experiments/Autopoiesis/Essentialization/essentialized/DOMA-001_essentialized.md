## Law
The pre-universal state is the Silent Superposition (Ψ₀), a uniform field of all possible temporal frequencies (ω) in a state of perfect destructive interference, resulting in a null temporal vector.
$$
\Psi_0 = \int c(\omega) e^{i\omega t} d\omega \quad \text{such that} \quad \langle \Psi_0 \rangle = 0
$$
The universe's genesis is a spontaneous symmetry-breaking event, the First Pirouette, which establishes the first non-trivial solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p). This act is an indivisible, simultaneous emergence of three co-dependent principles:

1.  **Temporal Pressure (Γ):** A gradient generated by the initial fluctuation (δΨ) against the uniform potential of Ψ₀.
    $$
    \Gamma \propto \nabla(\delta\Psi)
    $$
2.  **Resonant Form (Ki):** The most efficient, self-sustaining geometric pattern that resolves and perpetuates the pressure Γ. Ki is an eigenstate of the emergent dynamics.
3.  **Intrinsic Time (τ_p):** The fundamental period of one cycle of the resonant form Ki. It is the first quantized unit of duration, defined by the system's own rhythm, not by an external metric.
    $$
    \tau_p = \frac{1}{\nu_{Ki}}
    $$
These three are not a causal sequence but a simultaneous coordinate system for a single event: {δΨ} ↦ {Γ, Ki, τ_p}.

The dynamics are governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which states that the action (S_p) is maximized. The Pirouette Lagrangian is defined as:
$$
\mathcal{L}_p = K_\tau - V_\Gamma
$$
where K_τ is the Coherence, a kinetic term representing the temporal integrity and self-resonance of the form Ki over its cycle τ_p, and V_Γ is the Pressure Potential, a term representing the tension the form generates.

The genesis event corresponds to the transition from a state where 𝓛_p = 0 (the Silent Superposition) to the first available state where 𝓛_p > 0. The universe exists because existence is a state of higher coherence than non-existence.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is falsified if evidence demonstrates a temporal or causal separation in the emergence of Γ, Ki, or a fundamental time metric. If form can be shown to arise in a pre-existing temporal pressure field, or if a primordial time quantum is discovered independent of any resonant form, the law of simultaneous emergence is violated.

## Philosophy
Existence is not a state of being, but a continuous, autopoietic act of becoming. The universe did not simply begin; it instantiated the process of beginning, a self-referential loop that must be actively maintained at every moment. Persistence is not inertia; it is an unceasing, resonant performance. To be is to perpetually re-create oneself.

## Art
The cosmos is not a machine that was wound up, but a lone note that discovered its own echo and chose to sing forever.
