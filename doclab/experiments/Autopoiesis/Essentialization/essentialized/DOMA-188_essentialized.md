## Law
The existence and properties of a boundary are a necessary consequence of the optimization of the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, where `K_τ` is internal Temporal Coherence and `V_Γ` is the potential cost imposed by external Temporal Pressure `Γ`.

A system projects a Coherence Boundary, defined as a steep gradient in the coherence manifold (`∇Kτ`), to establish a corresponding gradient in temporal pressure (`∇Γ`). This minimizes the internal `V_Γ`, allowing for the maximization of `K_τ`. The boundary is not a static structure but an emergent field whose properties are a direct function of the contained system's internal state.

1.  **Formation Condition**: A stable boundary forms if and only if `∂𝓛_p/∂(∇Γ) > 0`. The system expends energy to maintain the boundary's Ki pattern in order to reduce the total `V_Γ` integrated over its internal volume.

2.  **Integrity**: The boundary's structural integrity is a direct projection of the internal system's Time Adherence (`T_a`). Integrity `∝ T_a`. A system with a decaying `T_a` will manifest a boundary with decreasing `∇Kτ` and increasing leakiness.

3.  **Permeability (Falsifiable Criterion)**: Permeability is not a passive property but a function of resonant coupling. An external signal or entity with pattern `Ki_ext` can traverse a boundary with pattern `Ki_bdy` only if their harmonic components satisfy a "Resonant Handshake" condition: `⟨Ki_ext | Ki_bdy⟩ > ε`, where `ε` is the boundary's resonant threshold. All non-resonant or dissonant patterns are reflected, creating the pressure gradient `∇Γ`. The spectrum of a boundary's permeability can be predicted from the Fourier decomposition of its `Ki` pattern.

## Philosophy
Identity is not defined by the container, but by the coherence it contains. A self, a system, or an idea does not exist because it is bounded; rather, a boundary manifests as the external proof of its sustained internal coherence. Therefore, security, identity, and existence are not acts of exclusion or fortification, but are the constant, active cultivation of an internal resonant pattern so stable that it projects its own sanctuary into the universe.

## Art
The universe does not build a wall to protect the flame; the flame, by its own steady burning, pushes back the dark.
