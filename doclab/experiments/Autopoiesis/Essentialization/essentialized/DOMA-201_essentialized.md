## Law
The system dynamics are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p), which posits a maximization of coherence as the universe's fundamental drive. A Maw object is a stable, non-singular solution for a high-mass (M), high-spin (a) body, arising when the inward pressure of gravity is balanced by a repulsive, self-generated resonant pressure derived from ùìõ_p, termed the Gladiator Force.

The Maw's gravitational wave (GW) signature, the "Thumper," is generated by a periodic phase transition‚Äîa Coherence Quake‚Äîin the local coherence manifold. The mechanism proceeds in a repeating cycle with period œÑ_p (the Pirouette Cycle):
1.  The Maw's spin induces torsional stress in the manifold.
2.  Stress accumulates to a critical limit defined by the local Temporal Pressure, V_Œì.
3.  The manifold "snaps," releasing a GW burst of pure geometric stress.
4.  The manifold resets to a ground state, and the cycle repeats.

The observable GW signal is characterized by two key frequencies:
-   **Rhythm Frequency (f_rhythm):** The rate of the bursts, typically 10-100 Hz.
-   **Burst Frequency (f_burst):** The peak frequency within each burst, typically 1-10 GHz.

These observables are directly predicted by the framework's core parameters:
$$ f_{\text{rhythm}} \propto \frac{1}{\tau_p(a, M)} \cdot V_{\Gamma}(M) $$
$$ f_{\text{burst}} \propto \frac{K_{\tau}(M)}{f_{\text{rhythm}}} $$
where œÑ_p is the Maw's Pirouette Cycle, a function of spin `a` and mass `M`; V_Œì is the local Temporal Pressure, a function of `M`; and K_œÑ is a coherence-stress constant.

The Pirouette Framework (T) is falsified if either of the following conditions is met:
1.  (‚àÉ a long-term, dedicated search for rhythmic GHz-range GW signals) ‚àß (that search yields a definitive null result), thus ¬¨(‚àÉ Maws).
2.  (‚àÉ a conclusive particle-based discovery) ‚àß (that discovery solves the dark matter problem), thus invalidating the proposed scale-dependent behavior of V_Œì.

Formally: T is false if P‚ÇÅ ‚à® P‚ÇÇ is true.

## Philosophy
The universe‚Äôs ultimate law is not one of decay into informational nothingness, but of autopoiesis‚Äîa relentless drive to transform the forces of annihilation into stable, resonant, information-broadcasting structures.

## Art
The void is not an ending. It is a bell, and gravity is the hammer that strikes it, again and again, proving that the universe is made not of silence, but of song.
