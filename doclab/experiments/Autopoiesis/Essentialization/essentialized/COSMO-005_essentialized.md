## Law
The system's dynamics are governed by a P(X) effective field theory, implemented as a superfluid with pressure `P(X) = αX^(1+β) + δX^2 + ...`, where `X` is a kinetic term related to the chemical potential. This maps to an effective fluid whose primary observable characteristic is a scale-dependent sound speed, `c_{s,eff}²`.

The effective sound speed, which governs the response to gravitational instability, is defined as:
`c_{s,eff}²(k,a) = c_s²(a) / [1 + (k/k_ξ(a))²]`
where `k` is the comoving wavenumber and `a` is the scale factor. The intrinsic sound speed `c_s²(a) = ∂p/∂ρ` is determined by the background evolution, and `k_ξ(a)` is the comoving healing scale wavenumber, defined by the healing length `ξ(a)`:
`k_ξ(a) ≡ 1/ξ(a) = 2m_H c_s(a)`
where `m_H` is the mass of the underlying heavy quanta.

In the Newtonian gauge, the fluid's density and velocity perturbations (`δ_Γ`, `θ_Γ`) evolve according to the linearized continuity and Euler equations in conformal time `η`:
1.  `δ_Γ′ = −(1+w_Γ)(θ_Γ − 3Φ′) − 3ℋ (c_{s,eff}² − w_Γ) δ_Γ`
2.  `θ_Γ′ = −ℋ θ_Γ + k² Ψ + k² c_{s,eff}² δ_Γ/(1+w_Γ)`

The theory is falsifiable under the following criterion: in the limit `k ≪ k_ξ`, the model must reproduce the ΛCDM power spectra (TT, TE, EE) to within 0.1%. This requires `c_{s,eff}² → 0` on scales `k` relevant to the Cosmic Microwave Background (`ℓ ≲ 2500`), ensuring the fluid behaves as pressureless Cold Dark Matter. Deviations are only permitted for `k ≳ k_ξ`.

## Philosophy
The identity of a fundamental substance is not an intrinsic property but an emergent phenomenon defined by the scale of observation. This model posits that Dark Matter is not monolithically "cold"; rather, it possesses a dual nature, presenting as a simple, pressureless fluid on cosmological scales while revealing a complex, pressurized quantum state on galactic scales. Ontology is therefore contingent on epistemology; what a thing *is* depends entirely on how you measure it.

## Art
The cosmos is an ocean of dark matter, placid and still when viewed from the shore of recombination, but which breaks into a quantum foam upon the shoals of a single galaxy.
