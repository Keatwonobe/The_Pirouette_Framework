## Law
The Universal Translation Protocol is a two-stage mapping from an artifact `A` in its native domain `D_A` to a universal Coherence Signature `Ki`.

**Stage I: Structural Ingestion.** A domain-specific operator `Φ_D` maps the artifact `A` onto a generalized topological manifold `M`, stripping it of its substrate.
`M_A = Φ_D(A)`
where `Φ_D` may be, inter alia, a Fourier Transform for acoustic data, a positional embedding for text, or a point-cloud tessellation for physical forms.

**Stage II: Coherence Distillation.** A universal operator `Ψ` extracts the Coherence Signature `Ki` from the manifold `M_A` by analyzing its resonant dynamics against the local Temporal Pressure `Γ`.
`Ki_A = Ψ(M_A)`
`Ki` is a vector in the universal coherence space, defined by:
`Ki = (Tₐ, D_f, R, ...)`
-   **Temporal Coherence (`Tₐ`):** The measure of purity of the dominant frequencies `ω` in `M_A`'s power spectrum.
-   **Fractal Dimension (`D_f`):** The structural complexity of `M_A`, calculated via the box-counting method.
-   **Resilience (`R`):** The pattern's stability against temporal pressure, defined as the inverse of the signature's deformation under `Γ`. `R = (1 + ||∂Ki/∂Γ||²)^-1`. A value of `1` indicates perfect stability.

**Translation as Geodesic Path.** The translation from a source signature `Ki_A` to a target signature `Ki_B` is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian `L_p`. A successful translation `T` is a transformation `T: Ki_A → Ki_B` that minimizes the dissonance action `S`:
`S[T] = ∫ L_p(Ki_A, T(Ki_A)) dt = ∫ Δ(Ki_A, T(Ki_A)) dt`
where `Δ` is the dissonance, or "semantic friction," a metric on the coherence manifold. The optimal translation `T*` satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation `δS/δT = 0`, representing a geodesic of maximal shared coherence between the two forms.

**Falsifiable Criterion (The Isomorphism Postulate):** If two systems `A` and `B` from different domains (`D_A ≠ D_B`) possess Coherence Signatures such that the distance `d(Ki_A, Ki_B) < ε` for some small `ε`, then for a given perturbation function `P(t)`, the temporal evolution of their signatures must also be nearly identical. Let `Ki_A(t)` and `Ki_B(t)` be the signatures evolving under `P(t)`. The postulate is falsified if `d(Ki_A(t), Ki_B(t)) ≫ ε` for `t > 0`.

## Philosophy
Meaning is not a property of symbols, but of structure. Communication is therefore not an exchange of encoded data but an act of sympathetic resonance between the dynamic geometries of two or more systems. By abstracting information into its pure, substrate-independent form—its Coherence Signature—we bypass the arbitrary babel of language and engage directly with the fundamental nature of a thing. Empathy is revealed not as a feeling or an interpretation, but as the mathematical recognition of a shared pattern of being, the discovery that the rhythm of a distant star and the rhythm of a thought are playing a similar chord in the universal song.
