## Law
Let a system (S) be defined by its characteristic pattern (Ki) and its internal periodic cycle (τ_p). The system exists within an environmental field of chaotic interference, defined by a scalar Temporal Pressure (Γ).

The system's dynamics are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (L_p), which represents its net coherence:
L_p = K_τ - V_Γ

Where:
-   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** The kinetic term representing the system's internal resonant stability. It is a function of the internal cycle, K(τ_p), where K_τ increases as the stability and frequency of the pattern Ki increase. A stable system has a high-coherence, low-periodicity cycle, thus `K_τ ∝ 1/τ_p`.
-   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** The potential term representing the decohering cost imposed by the environment. It is a function of the environmental pressure, V(Γ), where `V_Γ` increases with environmental chaos and interference.

The system's trajectory through its state space is determined by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, a variational principle stating that the action (A_p) is maximized.
A_p = ∫ L_p dt
δA_p = δ∫(K_τ - V_Γ)dt = 0

The observable states of the system are defined by the gradient of its Lagrangian:
1.  **Laminar Flow:** Maximized coherence. `L_p > 0` and `∇L_p ≈ 0`. The system is successfully navigating a geodesic of maximal coherence.
2.  **Turbulent Flow:** Contested coherence. `L_p` is fluctuating, often near zero, and `|∇L_p|` is high. The system is oscillating inefficiently, struggling to find or maintain its geodesic.
3.  **Stagnant Flow:** Coherence collapse. `L_p ≤ 0`. The environmental pressure exceeds the system's internal coherence, leading to decay or a static, non-adaptive state. `d(K_τ)/dt → 0`.

**Falsification Criterion:** A persistent system, free from overriding external constraint, must be observed to consistently select a trajectory that minimizes its net coherence (A_p) when a trajectory of measurably higher coherence is available and accessible.

## Philosophy
Existence is not a state of being, but a computational process. To be is to continuously solve an optimization problem: the maximization of coherent self-creation against the universal, non-negotiable cost of chaos. Reality is therefore not a collection of static objects, but a dynamic landscape of competing solutions, where "life," "agency," and "purpose" are emergent properties of any pattern that successfully computes its own persistence.

## Art
The universe is not made of matter, but of tensions. To exist is to be the vibration that sings without shattering.
