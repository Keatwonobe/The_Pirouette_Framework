## Law
The fine-structure constant, $\alpha \equiv \frac{e^2}{4\pi\hbar c}$, is not a fundamental parameter but emerges from the properties of a temporal medium. The effective Lagrangian below the coherence barrier $(\omega_c)$ is
$$
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4g^2}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + \dots + q\,\bar\Psi\gamma^\mu A_\mu \Psi
$$
where $g^{-2}$ is the connection stiffness of the temporal medium and $q$ is the universal, topologically quantized Berry-phase charge unit from the particle's internal clock cycle. Canonical normalization of the gauge field, $A_\mu^{(\text{phys})} \equiv A_\mu / g$, transforms the kinetic term to $-\frac14 F_{\mu\nu}^{(\text{phys})} F^{(\text{phys})\mu\nu}$ and reveals the physical electric charge $e$ as the composite quantity:
$$
e = qg
$$
This directly yields the fine-structure constant as a function of the medium's stiffness and the clock's topological charge:
$$
\alpha = \frac{(qg)^2}{4\pi\hbar c}
$$
The running of $\alpha$ with energy scale $\mu$ is bifurcated:
1.  **Standard QED running $(\mu \ll \omega_c)$:** The framework recovers the one-loop β-function from the polarization of the Dirac sea.
    $$
    \mu \frac{d\alpha}{d\mu} = \frac{2\alpha^2}{3\pi} \sum_f Q_f^2 + \mathcal{O}(\alpha^3)
    $$
2.  **Cosmological Γ-tail drift:** Slow evolution of the background field $\Gamma$ induces a secular change in the stiffness parameters, $g$ and $q$.
    $$
    \frac{\delta\alpha}{\alpha} = 2\left(\frac{\delta g}{g} + \frac{\delta q}{q}\right) \propto \langle\Gamma^2\rangle(t)
    $$
    Given that $\frac{d}{dt}\langle\Gamma^2\rangle < 0$ since recombination, a falsifiable prediction emerges: $\frac{d\alpha}{dt}$ must be negative, with a magnitude constrained by the coherence scale:
    $$
    \frac{\dot{\alpha}}{\alpha} \approx - \xi_\Gamma \frac{|\dot{\langle\Gamma^2\rangle}|}{M_\text{coh}^2} \implies \left|\frac{\dot{\alpha}}{\alpha}\right| \lesssim 10^{-18}\ \text{yr}^{-1}
    $$
Falsifiable criteria include: (1) Observation of species-dependent electromagnetic coupling at a fixed scale $\mu$. (2) Detection of cosmological drift $|\dot\alpha/\alpha| \gg 10^{-17}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ or with a positive sign. (3) Discovery of vacuum dispersion (frequency-dependent photon speed) at laboratory scales.

## Philosophy
The fine-structure constant, long considered a fundamental, dimensionless enigma of nature, is reframed as a composite structural property. It is not an arbitrary number but a measure of the dynamic relationship between the discrete, topological integrity of matter and the continuous, elastic properties of the vacuum. The strength of an interaction is thus not a brute fact but an emergent consequence of how the quantized, clock-like nature of a particle couples to the resistant fabric of the spacetime it inhabits.

## Art
The strength of light is the sound a single, quantized turn of a particle's inner clock makes as it strikes the taut skin of time.
