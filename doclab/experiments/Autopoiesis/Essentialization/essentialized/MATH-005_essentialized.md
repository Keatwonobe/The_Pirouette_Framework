## Law
The configuration space of possible Ki rhythms is a Riemannian manifold $(M_\phi, g)$ whose metric tensor $g_{ij}(\phi)$ is derived from the kinetic term of the Pirouette Lagrangian, $L_p = K_\tau(\phi, \dot{\phi}) - V(\phi)$, such that $K_\tau = \frac{1}{2} g_{ij}(\phi) \dot{\phi}^i \dot{\phi}^j$.

The Euler-Lagrange equation of motion is:
$$ \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L_p}{\partial \dot{\phi}^k} \right) - \frac{\partial L_p}{\partial \phi^k} = 0 $$
Substituting $L_p$ and performing the differentiation yields:
$$ g_{ik} \ddot{\phi}^i + \frac{\partial g_{ik}}{\partial \phi^j} \dot{\phi}^i \dot{\phi}^j - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial \phi^k} \dot{\phi}^i \dot{\phi}^j + \frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi^k} = 0 $$
Multiplying by the inverse metric $g^{mk}$ and using the definition of the Christoffel symbols, $\Gamma^m_{jk} = \frac{1}{2} g^{mi} \left( \frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial \phi^k} + \frac{\partial g_{ik}}{\partial \phi^j} - \frac{\partial g_{jk}}{\partial \phi^i} \right)$, this simplifies to:
$$ \ddot{\phi}^m + \Gamma^m_{jk} \dot{\phi}^j \dot{\phi}^k = -g^{mk} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi^k} $$
The left side is the geodesic equation. The right side is the "force" term derived from the potential. By re-interpreting the potential $V(\phi)$ as a conformal factor that warps the manifold geometry, the force term is absorbed into the Christoffel symbols, proving the Geodesic Equivalence Theorem:
$$ \ddot{\phi}^k + \tilde{\Gamma}^k_{ij} \dot{\phi}^i \dot{\phi}^j = 0 $$
where $\tilde{\Gamma}$ are the symbols of the warped metric. Motion under the Principle of Maximal Coherence is identical to geodesic motion on the Coherence Manifold.

**Falsifiable Criteria (The Curvature-Interaction Dictionary):**
1.  **Attraction/Repulsion:** Must correspond to positive/negative sectional curvature of $M_\phi$. An observed attractive force in a flat or negatively curved region falsifies the theory.
2.  **Conservation Laws:** Conserved quantities (e.g., momentum, charge) must correspond to Killing vector fields on $M_\phi$. A symmetry without a corresponding conserved quantity, or vice versa, is a falsification.
3.  **Confinement:** Forces like the Gladiator Force must correspond to a manifold topology where the distance to the boundary is infinite, not to a specific curvature profile.

## Philosophy
Physical laws are not prescriptive rules imposed upon a system, but are descriptive, emergent properties of the system's own geometry of possibilities. A system does not *obey* a law; its trajectory *is* the law, an inevitable tracing of the straightest possible path through the curved landscape of its own potential states. The distinction between a system and the rules it follows is therefore illusory.
