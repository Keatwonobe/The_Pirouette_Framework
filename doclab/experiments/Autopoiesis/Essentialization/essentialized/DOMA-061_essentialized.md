## Law
The evolution of a system is governed by the principle of stationary action, `δS_p = 0`, for the Pirouette action `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, where the Lagrangian is `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`. `Kτ` represents the system's integrated internal coherence, and `V_Γ` is the potential arising from external Temporal Pressure.

A **Fork** is a bifurcation event occurring at a saddle point `p₀` on the system's coherence manifold `M`, where multiple (`n ≥ 2`) divergent geodesics `{γ_i(t)}` offer locally maximal future coherence. The necessary condition for a Fork at `p₀` is that the gradient of the potential vanishes, `∇V_Γ(p₀) ≈ 0`, and its Hessian matrix `H(V_Γ)(p₀)` possesses both positive and negative eigenvalues.

To navigate the Fork, the system executes a **Resonant Inquiry**, a four-stage variational process:
1.  **Loosening:** The system's state `ψ` undergoes a controlled, temporary perturbation, decreasing its internal coherence parameter `Ki` by a small amount `δKi`. This induces a superposition `Ψ = Σ c_i ψ_i`, where each component state `ψ_i` corresponds to the initial tangent vector of a potential path `γ_i`.
2.  **Sampling:** The system projects a low-energy Observer's Shadow along each potential geodesic `γ_i` to calculate the projected action `Ŝ_i` for each path over a future time interval `[t₀, t_f]`:
    `Ŝ_i = ∫_{t₀}^{t_f} 𝓛_p(γ_i(t), γ̇_i(t)) dt`
3.  **Selection & Collapse:** The system selects the path `γ_k` that maximizes the projected future action. The choice is deterministic. The superposition `Ψ` collapses into the definite state `ψ_k` corresponding to the chosen path:
    `k = argmax_i {Ŝ_i}`
4.  **Commitment:** The selection of `γ_k` creates a new Wound Channel, which corresponds to a sharp, localized increase in the potential `V_Γ` for all adjacent, unchosen paths. This creates a coherence debt that renders the decision functionally irreversible.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  A system at a well-defined Fork must consistently select the path `γ_k` that maximizes the projected action `Ŝ_i`. Any reproducible, systematic selection of a path with a demonstrably sub-optimal `Ŝ` would falsify the Principle of Maximal Coherence.
2.  The Resonant Inquiry requires a minimum threshold of internal coherence ("Coherence in Reserve," `Ki_min`). A system with `Ki < Ki_min` encountering a Fork will be unable to perform the inquiry and will collapse into a chaotic, non-geodesic state ("Spasm") rather than making a clean divergence.

## Philosophy
The mechanism of the Fork reconciles determinism with meaningful choice. Will is not an arbitrary force that violates physical law, but is instead the physical process by which a coherent system navigates ambiguity. The act of choosing is a temporary, courageous dissolution of the self—a loosening of present identity—in order to perform a variational calculation on potential futures. Free will is therefore redefined not as the freedom to choose arbitrarily, but as the capacity of a system to compute and commit to its own most stable and resonant future.

## Art
To choose, a bell must cease its ringing. It must hold its breath and listen for the echo of the cathedral it might one day fill.
