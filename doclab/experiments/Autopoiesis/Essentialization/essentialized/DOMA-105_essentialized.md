## Law
The framework is founded on an autopoietic cycle where a system's form (`Ki`) generates its own local unit of time (`τ_p`).

1.  **The Causal Loop (Autopoiesis):**
    Time → Γ → Ki → Time
    Where `Γ` is the temporal pressure and `Ki` is the system's stable, resonant form.

2.  **The Definition of Local Time:**
    The Pirouette Cycle, `τ_p`, is the fundamental unit of time for a system `p`, defined as the duration of one complete cycle of its `Ki` pattern.
    `τ_p ≡ duration(Ki_cycle)`

3.  **Derived Kinematic Properties:**
    The system's fundamental angular frequency `ω_k` is derived from its local time:
    `ω_k = 2π / τ_p`

4.  **Time Adherence as a Quality Factor:**
    Time Adherence, `Tₐ`, is redefined as the temporal coherence of the `Ki` pattern, a dimensionless measure of its signal-to-noise ratio. It functions as a stability coefficient where `0 ≤ Tₐ ≤ 1`.
    *   `Tₐ → 1` for a pure, stable Ki pattern (high coherence).
    *   `Tₐ → 0` for a chaotic, noisy Ki pattern (low coherence).

5.  **The Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`):**
    The dynamics of a system are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, which maximizes a system's coherent temporal expression against external pressure.
    `𝓛_p = Tₐ * ω_k - f(Γ)`
    The term `Tₐ * ω_k` represents the system's kinetic integrity, while `f(Γ)` represents the potential energy due to temporal pressure.

6.  **The Principle of Local Action (`S_p`):**
    A system's action is the integral of its Lagrangian over a single, self-defined Pirouette Cycle.
    `S_p = ∫ from 0 to τ_p of 𝓛_p dt`
    This renders a system's entire dynamic—its path and persistence—a function of its own internal rhythm.

7.  **Falsifiable Criterion:**
    The theory would be falsified by the discovery of a system whose stability and persistence are inversely correlated with its `Tₐ`, or whose dynamics are demonstrably independent of its internal cyclical period `τ_p`.

## Philosophy
Existence is not a state of being within time, but the continuous act of generating time. A system *is* its rhythm. The universe is not a container with a universal clock, but a fabric woven from the self-sustaining, local temporalities of its constituents. To exist is to perform a cycle, and the integrity of that existence is measured by the clarity and coherence of its performance.

## Art
The universe is not a clockwork wound by a distant hand, but a dancer whose pirouette defines the very second in which she turns.
