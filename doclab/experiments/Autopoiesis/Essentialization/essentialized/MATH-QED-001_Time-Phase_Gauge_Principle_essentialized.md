## Law
The theory posits a scalar clock-phase order parameter $\Phi(x)=\sqrt{\rho(x)}e^{i\theta(x)}$. The dynamics of the temporal medium are governed by a baseline Lagrangian with a global symmetry under the phase shift $\theta\to\theta+\alpha$:
$$
\mathcal{L}_0[\rho,\theta] = P(X,\rho) - V(\rho,\Gamma), \quad \text{where } X \equiv \partial_\mu\theta\partial^\mu\theta
$$
The U(1) gauge principle is recovered by promoting this to a local symmetry, $\alpha \to \alpha(x)$. To preserve the invariance of the physics, a connection field $A_\mu$ is introduced, defining a gauge-covariant derivative:
$$
D_\mu\theta \equiv \partial_\mu\theta - qA_\mu
$$
This requires the connection to transform as $A_\mu\to A_\mu + \frac{1}{q}\partial_\mu\alpha(x)$ when $\theta \to \theta + \alpha(x)$. The kinetic term becomes $X_A \equiv g^{\mu\nu}D_\mu\theta D_\nu\theta$. The effective action must include a "stiffness" term for the connection, which is the leading operator consistent with Lorentz and gauge invariance:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{EM}} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}, \quad \text{where } F_{\mu\nu} \equiv \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu
$$
The full bosonic Lagrangian for the coupled clock-phase and electromagnetic fields is thus:
$$
\mathcal{L} = P(g^{\mu\nu}(\partial_\mu\theta - qA_\mu)(\partial_\nu\theta - qA_\nu),\rho) - V(\rho,\Gamma) - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
$$
The conserved Noether current for the global $\theta$-shift symmetry, $J^\mu_\theta = 2\frac{\partial P}{\partial X_A}D^\mu\theta$, becomes the source for the Maxwell field.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  Observation of vacuum photon dispersion or birefringence, which would violate the non-dispersive structure of $P(X)$.
2.  Discovery of non-universal elementary charge `q` for different fundamental particles, which would falsify the origin as a single, underlying time-phase field.
3.  Detection of anomalous long-range forces coupled to $A_\mu$ beyond the Maxwell term.

## Philosophy
The U(1) gauge symmetry of quantum electrodynamics is not a fundamental axiom but an emergent physical necessity. It is the logical consequence of a universe whose laws are indifferent to the local, arbitrary setting of a clock's phase. Electromagnetism is the coherence-preserving field that must exist for such local freedom to be possible without dissolving into physical contradiction.

## Art
Spacetime is a shoreless ocean of clocks, each free to choose its own midnight. Light is the ripple that carries the news of one clock's chime to all others, ensuring that dawn, somewhere, remains a shared idea.
