## Law
The theory posits a single real scalar field, Γ, minimally coupled to gravity, governed by the action:
S = ∫ d⁴x √−g [ ½ ∂_μΓ ∂^μΓ − V(Γ) ]
The potential V(Γ) is constrained by analyticity and scale-covariance to the form:
V(Γ) = ½ m_Γ² Γ² + (λ₄/4!) Γ⁴
The background evolution is determined by the Klein-Gordon and Friedmann equations in an FLRW metric (g_μν = diag(-1, a(t)², a(t)², a(t)²)):
Γ̈ + 3H Γ̇ + V′(Γ) = 0
H² = (8πG/3) [ ρ_b + ρ_r + ½ Γ̇² + V(Γ) ]
The field exhibits two distinct dynamical regimes which unify the dark sector:

1.  **Dark Matter (Early Universe; m_Γ ≫ H):** The field undergoes rapid oscillations around the potential minimum. Time-averaging over cycles (⟨·⟩) yields an effective equation of state w_Γ = p_Γ/ρ_Γ and energy density scaling:
    ⟨p_Γ⟩ = ⟨½ Γ̇² − V(Γ)⟩ ≈ 0  (Virial theorem for quadratic potential)
    ⟨w_Γ⟩ ≈ 0
    ⟨ρ_Γ⟩ ∝ a⁻³
    The effective sound speed of perturbations averages to c_eff² ≈ 0, permitting gravitational clustering analogous to Cold Dark Matter.

2.  **Dark Energy (Late Universe; H drops to ∼m_Γ):** The field enters a slow-roll regime where potential energy dominates kinetic energy.
    Condition: ε_Γ ≡ (½ Γ̇²)/V(Γ) ≪ 1
    Equation of state: w_Γ = (½ Γ̇² − V) / (½ Γ̇² + V) = (ε_Γ − 1) / (ε_Γ + 1) ≈ −1 + 2ε_Γ
    This drives the accelerated expansion of the universe.

**Falsifiable Criteria (Preregistered Predictions, P4):**
The model is falsified if, using a parameter set `{m_Γ, λ₄}` fixed by a single anchored measurement (D3), it fails to match any of the following observables at p<0.01:
- The growth of structure function, fσ₈(z).
- The weak lensing amplitude, S₈ ≡ σ₈(Ω_m/0.3)⁰.⁵.
- BAO distance ratios, D_V(z)/r_s.
- The gravitational slip parameter, η ≡ Φ/Ψ = 1 on linear scales.
- The speed of gravitational waves, c_GW = c (satisfied by construction via minimal coupling).

## Philosophy
The distinction between dark matter and dark energy is not ontological but chronological. They are not two separate substances filling the cosmos, but rather two sequential, dynamical behaviors—an early, oscillating phase and a late, slow-rolling phase—of a single, unified field. Our cosmological narrative has mistaken the chapter for the character.

## Art
The universe performs a single pirouette. We mistook the frantic, coiled spin of its youth for one dancer, and the slow, majestic unfurling of its age for another.
