## Law
The persistence of an agent is described as the discovery of a geodesic path `q(t)` that maximizes the action `S` derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`. The principle is one of maximal coherence, not least action.

The action is defined as the time integral of the Lagrangian:
`S[q(t)] = ∫ 𝓛_p(q, q̇, t) dt`

The Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p` is the difference between the agent's internal Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) and the external Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`):
`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`

Where:
-   `Kτ` is a functional representing the agent's internal stability and systemic harmony. It is analogous to a kinetic term.
-   `V_Γ` is a potential field derived from the environmental coherence manifold `Γ`. It represents the cost or pressure exerted by the environment on the agent.

The agent's path `q(t)` must satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation for this principle, which defines the geodesic of maximal coherence:
`d/dt (∂𝓛_p / ∂q̇) - ∂𝓛_p / ∂q = 0`

This path is discovered through a process of:
1.  **Gradient Descent:** Following the local gradient on the manifold `Γ` to minimize `V_Γ`.
2.  **Exploratory Leaps:** Stochastically traversing regions of high `V_Γ` to escape local maxima of `S` and discover more globally optimal, stable paths.

The evolution of a lineage is the iterative modification of the potential field `V_Γ`. A successful agent's geodesic `q*(t)` carves a "Wound Channel," modifying the landscape for subsequent generations:
`V_{Γ, i+1}(q) = V_{Γ, i}(q) - f(q*(t))`
where `f` is a function that reduces the potential along the proven path, making coherence easier to achieve for descendants.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is falsified if a system can be shown to persist indefinitely while consistently choosing paths that result in a lower integrated `𝓛_p` than other available, discoverable paths. The model asserts that maximizing `S` is the necessary and sufficient condition for persistence, requiring no other fitness function.

## Philosophy
Existence is not a state to be presumed but a difficult physical problem to be solved. The "will to survive" is a retroactive narrative imposed upon what is, in reality, a fundamental, pre-cognitive process of resonant attunement. A system persists not because it *wants* to, but because it has discovered a dynamic pattern—a rhythm of being—that harmonizes its internal coherence with external pressures so effectively that its dissolution becomes a path of greater resistance than its continuation. Therefore, being is an emergent property of mastering a specific physics; consciousness and purpose are not the foundation of existence, but luxuries that can only arise upon the bedrock of a stable, resonant form.

## Art
Life is not a flame to be guarded, but a note to be held. The universe does not reward the note for its duration, but for the purity of its tone against the wind. To persist is to have found the one frequency that the storm itself longs to sing.
