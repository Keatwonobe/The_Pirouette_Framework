## Law
The justice system is modeled as a coherence manifold `M` upon which an individual's state `x(t)` evolves. The trajectory of an individual is a geodesic path that extremizes the action `S`, derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p`.

The action principle is `δS = 0`, where `S = ∫𝓛_p dt`.
The Lagrangian is defined as:
`𝓛_p(x, ẋ, t) = Kτ(ẋ) - VΓ(x)`

Where:
-   `Kτ(ẋ)` is the temporal coherence, or kinetic term, representing an individual's internal capacity for pro-social change. It is a function of the velocity of their state vector, `ẋ`. Formally, `Kτ = ½ m(w) gᵢⱼ ẋⁱ ẋʲ`, where `m(w)` is a scalar "inertial mass" determined by the individual's Wound Channel (past trauma/record `w`) and `gᵢⱼ` is the metric tensor of the state space.
-   `VΓ(x)` is the temporal pressure, or potential term, representing the sum of external systemic forces (stigma, punitive laws, economic barriers). `VΓ` defines the curvature of the manifold `M`.

The equation of motion for an individual's trajectory is the Euler-Lagrange equation:
`d/dt (∂𝓛_p/∂ẋⁱ) - ∂𝓛_p/∂xⁱ = 0`

This formalism yields the following falsifiable criteria:

1.  **Recidivism as a Stable Attractor:** The existence of local minima in the potential field `VΓ(x)` (e.g., regions of high stigma and low opportunity) will create stable attractors. The model predicts that the probability of recidivism is proportional to the depth and basin of attraction of these potential wells.
2.  **Rehabilitation as Geodesic Sculpting:** Interventions that reduce the gradient `∇(VΓ)` along a pro-social path or increase an individual's kinetic capacity `Kτ` will measurably lower recidivism rates compared to a control population.
3.  **Systemic Stagnation as Infinite Potential Barrier:** Regions on the manifold where `VΓ(x) → ∞` (e.g., insurmountable bureaucratic hurdles for expungement, absolute bars to employment) will correlate with zero or near-zero flow (`ẋ → 0`), corresponding to measurable system blockages like pre-trial detention backlogs or permanent marginalization.

## Philosophy
The model's core philosophical implication is the relocation of moral responsibility from the individual actor to the systemic architect. An individual's path is not a series of discrete, free-willed choices but a geodesic—the path of least resistance through a landscape of forces defined by law and society. Consequently, the primary locus of justice is not the actor's transgression but the designer's world-building. A system whose geometry makes paths of recidivism and despair the "easiest" to travel is not merely inefficient; it is structurally unethical, regardless of its stated intent. Justice, therefore, is transformed from an act of retrospective judgment into the moral imperative of prospective landscape architecture.

## Art
We ask the fallen why they fell, never asking who tilted the floor. Justice is not a judgment; it is a plumb line for the world.
