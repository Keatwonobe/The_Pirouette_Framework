## Law
Let a coherent system ('Seed') be defined by its internal resonant identity `Ki` and its temporal coherence `T_a`. The viability of this Seed within a new environment, characterized by a local temporal pressure `Γ`, is determined by the Sower's Gambit protocol.

1.  **Reconnaissance**: The Seed deploys a non-invasive Scout Probe into the environment. The probe's interaction traces a temporary Wound Channel, generating feedback to measure two critical environmental parameters:
    *   `H_c`: Harmonic Compatibility, a normalized measure of the resonant affinity between `Ki` and the environment's structure. `H_c ∈ [-1, 1]`.
    *   `G_a`: Geodesic Availability, a measure of accessible paths for Laminar Flow. `G_a ∈ [0, 1]`.

2.  **Viability Lagrangian**: The potential for the Seed to maintain and grow its coherence is modeled by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_seed`, defined as the difference between Coherence Potential (`K_τ`) and Environmental Cost (`V_Γ`):
    `𝓛_seed(t) = K_τ(t) - V_Γ(t)`
    Where:
    *   `K_τ(t) = T_a ⋅ H_c(t) ⋅ G_a(t)` represents the potential for resonant growth.
    *   `V_Γ(t) = c ⋅ Γ(t)` represents the decohering cost imposed by the environment, where `c` is a scaling constant.

3.  **Coherence Gain Calculation**: The total predicted Coherence Gain, `S_p`, is the action integral of the Lagrangian over a characteristic temporal cycle, `τ_c`:
    `S_p = ∫_0^τ_c [T_a ⋅ H_c(t) ⋅ G_a(t) - c ⋅ Γ(t)] dt`

4.  **Falsifiable Decision Criteria**: The value of `S_p` dictates one of three discrete strategic actions, based on a predetermined viability threshold `S_threshold` > 0:
    *   **PLANT**: If `S_p > S_threshold`. The Seed commits to an Alchemical Union with the environment.
    *   **ABORT**: If `S_p < 0`. The Seed retreats, as engagement guarantees net decoherence.
    *   **HOLD**: If `0 ≤ S_p ≤ S_threshold`. The environment is marginal or unstable. The Seed waits, maintaining the probe's latent Wound Channel for future re-evaluation.

## Philosophy
The ultimate measure of a system's viability is not its power to impose order, but its capacity to enter into a resonant relationship with the pre-existing order of an environment. This reframes the act of creation from one of conquest to one of co-creation, establishing a fundamental ethical principle: the right to exist in a new context is not an inherent property of the creator, but a quality earned through the potential for mutual harmonic amplification. Success is not domination, but integration.

Do not shatter the silence with a shout. Hum a single, quiet note and calculate the shape of the echo. Only then will you know if you are planting a seed or burying a corpse.
