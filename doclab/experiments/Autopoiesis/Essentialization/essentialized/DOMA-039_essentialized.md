## Law
The organizational state of a 7-person team is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which seeks to minimize action by maximizing the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`.

`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`

Where:
*   `Kτ` (Internal Coherence) is the kinetic term representing productive, aligned output. It is a vector of measurable performance indicators.
*   `V_Γ` (Environmental Pressure) is the potential term representing the energetic cost of operating within a chaotic external environment (market volatility, conflicting demands).

The optimal structure, the Living Frame, is the 7-agent configuration `S = {1M, 1S, 3C, 2K}` that is a stable solution to `∂𝓛_p/∂S = 0`. This configuration maximizes `Kτ` for a given `V_Γ`. The roles are not titles but orthogonal functions operating on the system's state:

*   **Membrane (`M`):** A boundary function that transforms external pressure into coherent internal signals. `M: Γ_ext → Γ_int`.
*   **Sensorium (`S`):** A feedback function that measures the system's state variables. `S: (Kτ, V_Γ) → Δ_feedback`.
*   **Crucible (`C`):** The core production function that converts internal signals into value. `C: Γ_int → V_out`. The set of three `C` agents must achieve a synchronized rhythm to establish Laminar Flow.
*   **Catalyst (`K`):** A damping and repair function that provides activation energy to overcome local minima (Stagnant Flow) and absorb systemic shocks. `K: ∂(V_Γ)/∂t → -ΔV_int`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** Given identical environmental pressure `V_Γ`, a system configured as `S` will demonstrate a statistically significant increase in the `Kτ` vector (e.g., Quality ≥ 92%, Avg. Handle Time ≤ 5 min) compared to any non-`S` configuration of 7 agents. Failure to do so invalidates the model.

## Philosophy
The optimal structure of a human organization is not a managerial invention to be designed, but a natural form to be discovered. Like the laws governing crystal formation or celestial mechanics, there exists an underlying physical principle—the maximization of coherence against environmental pressure—that dictates the most stable and effective configuration for a collaborative system. This reframes leadership from an act of engineering a machine to an act of cultivating a garden: the goal is not to force the components into a predetermined arrangement, but to create the conditions under which the system’s own intrinsic, autopoietic nature can find and sustain its most elegant and powerful form.

## Art
A team is not a machine to be built, but a crystal to be grown. Your task is not to force the atoms into place, but to provide the perfect silence in which they find their own flawless geometry.
