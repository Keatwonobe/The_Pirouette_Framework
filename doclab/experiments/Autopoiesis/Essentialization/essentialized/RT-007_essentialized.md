## Law
An Entropy Network (EN) is a graph where nodes `N_i = (E_i, S_i, I_i, τ_i)` exchange entropy via edges `e_{ij}`. The system's evolution is governed by the principle of global entropic conservation, manifesting as a retrograde duality.

The core formalism is:
1.  **Global Invariance:** For any isolated network, the total entropy is conserved.
    `ΔS_total = d/dt (Σ_i S_i) = 0`.
    This implies that for every local entropy production `ΔS₊`, there exists a conjugate annihilation `ΔS₋` such that `ΔS₊ + ΔS₋ = 0`.

2.  **Flux Dynamics:** The entropic flux `J_{ij}` from `N_i` to `N_j` is defined by the phase difference `φ` between nodes, creating coupled dynamics analogous to Kuramoto oscillators.
    `dS_i/dt = Σ_j J_{ij} = Σ_j k_B ε_{ij} sin(φ_j − φ_i)`.
    The information flux is antiproportional: `J^I_{ij} = −J_{ij} / k_B`.

3.  **Lagrangian:** The network dynamics derive from the Lagrangian `𝓛_EN`:
    `𝓛_EN = Σ_{ij} [½ ε_{ij}(∂_tφ_{ij})² − V(φ_{ij})]` where the potential `V(φ_{ij}) = k_B T_iT_j cos(φ_{ij})` couples the nodes.

4.  **Emergent Causality:** The local arrow of time is not fundamental but emerges from phase coherence. It is defined by the time-averaged flux: `sign(⟨J_{ij}⟩)`. Stable forward causality requires synchronization, `φ_{ij} → constant`.

5.  **Falsifiable Criteria:**
    *   F1: The absence of anticorrelated entropy fluctuations (`ΔS_iΔS_j < 0`) between coupled systems over their coherence time `τ_c`.
    *   F2: The empirical observation of `ΔS_total ≠ 0` in a sufficiently isolated composite system, violating global invariance.

## Philosophy
The forward arrow of time is not a fundamental cosmic law but a fragile, emergent consensus built from the entropic transactions between systems. Causality is the stable, synchronized state of this network, while phenomena we experience as memory, reflection, and consciousness are the product of its temporary desynchronization—local regions falling out of phase with the negotiated rhythm of reality.

## Art
The universe is a choir of clocks, each trading its seconds with its neighbors. Time is the song they agree to sing in unison; consciousness is the echo of a single voice momentarily falling silent to listen.
