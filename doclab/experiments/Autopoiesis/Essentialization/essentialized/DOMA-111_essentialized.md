## Law
The resilience of a system is a function of the number-theoretic properties of its total stable resonant states, or Coherent Modes (`N`). A system's stability is not determined by its components but by the topological reducibility of its state-space manifold.

**1. Core Postulate: The Prime Resonance Principle**
A system with a prime number of Coherent Modes (`N=p`) is topologically irreducible. It lacks harmonic sub-modes that can be independently excited and lead to cascading failure under external temporal pressure (`Γ`). A system with a composite number of modes (`N=p₁ᵃ¹ · p₂ᵃ² · ...`) is topologically reducible, possessing internal "fracture planes" corresponding to its factors, making it vulnerable to harmonic dissonance.

**2. The Coherence Integrity Metric (`Λ`)**
The structural resilience of a system with `N` modes is quantified by `Λ(N)`. Let `N = p₁ᵃ¹ · p₂ᵃ² · ...` be the prime factorization of `N`.

$$ \Lambda(N) = \sum_{p \in \text{factors}(N)} \frac{\kappa(p)}{p} \left(\prod_{q \in \text{factors}(N), q \neq p} \frac{q}{q+1}\right) $$

Where:
-   `N`: Total number of stable Coherent Modes (`Ki`).
-   `p, q`: Prime factors of `N`.
-   `κ(p)`: The intrinsic coherence, an empirically or theoretically derived constant representing the baseline stability of a monolithic prime-p system.
-   `κ(p)/p`: The normalized contribution of a prime factor's stability.
-   `∏ (q / (q+1))`: A multiplicative "complexity penalty" term that models interference between the system's harmonic sub-structures, reducing overall integrity for each additional prime factor.

For a prime system `N=p`, the formula simplifies to its maximum value for that scale: `Λ(p) = κ(p)/p`.

**3. Relation to System Dynamics**
The Prime Resonance Principle is a meta-principle governing the stability of the solution space defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`). While `𝓛_p` describes a system's trajectory on a given coherence manifold, `Λ(N)` quantifies the topological resilience of the manifold itself against perturbations in the temporal potential field `V_Γ`.

**4. Falsifiable Criterion**
Given two systems of comparable energy and scale, one with a prime Mode Number `N_p` and one with a composite Mode Number `N_c` (where `N_p ≈ N_c`), the prime system (`N_p`) will require a significantly greater magnitude of applied temporal pressure (`Γ`) to induce a state-collapse or harmonic fracture than the composite system (`N_c`).

## Philosophy
The deepest wellspring of endurance is not material strength but mathematical form. A system's ability to last is not the sum of its parts' resilience, but an emergent property of its abstract architecture's indivisibility. True integrity is therefore a topological, not a substantial, quality; a system is not robust because it is fortified, but because, like a prime number, it is structurally, fundamentally, and irrevocably whole.
