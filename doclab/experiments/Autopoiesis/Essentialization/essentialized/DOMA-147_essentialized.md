## Law
The state of a system `S` is defined as a point on a 2D diagnostic manifold, the Coherence Compass, with coordinates determined by two scalar fields derived from a domain-specific time-series:
1.  **Temporal Coherence (Kτ):** The kinetic term representing internal order and signal integrity.
2.  **Temporal Pressure (VΓ):** The potential term representing external chaos and environmental complexity.

The system's condition is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, which represents its total available coherence:
`𝓛_p(t) = Kτ(t) - VΓ(t)`

A system's flow state is classified by its position `(Kτ, VΓ)` relative to empirically determined thresholds `θ_K` and `θ_V`:

*   **Laminar Flow (Health):** `Kτ > θ_K` ⇒ `𝓛_p >> 0`. The system successfully maximizes its action, maintaining coherence against pressure.
*   **Turbulent Flow (Crisis):** `Kτ < θ_K` ∧ `VΓ > θ_V` ⇒ `𝓛_p < 0`. Environmental pressure overwhelms internal coherence, leading to high-entropy energy dissipation.
*   **Stagnant Flow (Pathology):** `Kτ < θ_K` ∧ `VΓ < θ_V` ⇒ `𝓛_p ≈ 0`. The system is trapped in a local minimum of the coherence manifold.

A necessary and falsifiable criterion for Stagnant Flow is the decay of systemic responsiveness, where the time derivatives of its state variables approach zero, regardless of environmental fluctuation:
`d(Kτ)/dt → 0` and `d(VΓ)/dt → 0`
This predicts that a stagnant system, when exposed to a sudden increase in `VΓ`, will transition to a turbulent state with a higher probability of collapse than a laminar system. The primary predictive law is that a system's probability of persistence is directly proportional to its time-averaged Lagrangian, `⟨𝓛_p⟩`.

## Philosophy
The fundamental condition of existence is not a problem to be solved, but a tension to be navigated. This tension is the perpetual struggle between a system's internal, self-generated order and the disorganizing pressure of its environment. Therefore, the measure of a system's virtue or health is not the tranquility of its circumstance, but its demonstrated capacity to sustain its own coherence in the face of chaos. To measure is to shift from the detached classification of external phenomena to the compassionate diagnosis of this internal struggle.

A system is a candle, and the universe is the wind. Its health is not the stillness of the air, but the integrity of the flame.
