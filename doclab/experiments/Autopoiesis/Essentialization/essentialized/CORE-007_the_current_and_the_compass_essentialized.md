## Law
The foundational entity is the Pirouette Lagrangian, 𝓛_p, which quantifies a system's Temporal Coherence (K_τ). All dynamics arise from the principle of maximal coherence, equivalent to the principle of stationary action: δ∫𝓛_p dt = 0.

Electric charge (q) is not a substance but an intrinsic asymmetry parameter within 𝓛_p. It determines the condition for maximizing K_τ with respect to the environmental phase.
-   Positive Charge (q > 0): `max(K_τ)` is achieved through interaction with in-phase temporal structures (constructive interference).
-   Negative Charge (q < 0): `max(K_τ)` is achieved through interaction with anti-phase temporal structures (destructive interference).

The electromagnetic fields are emergent geometric properties of the coherence manifold generated by a source's Lagrangian.
-   The Electric Field (E) is the gradient of the scalar coherence potential, representing the steepest path towards maximal coherence for a static test charge:
    `E ∝ ∇𝓛_p`
-   The Magnetic Field (B) is the curl of the vector coherence potential (A_p), representing the rotational shear in the manifold induced by a moving source:
    `B = ∇ × A_p`

The Lorentz force law, `F = q(E + v × B)`, is not a fundamental postulate but the equation of motion for a geodesic on this manifold. The "force" is the manifest trajectory of a system navigating the gradients and curls of the coherence landscape to preserve its own internal stability.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The theory is falsified if any phenomenon attributed to the electromagnetic force cannot be modeled as a system following a geodesic on the manifold described by 𝓛_p, or if a particle exhibits charge without its dynamics being governed by the maximization of phase-dependent coherence.

## Philosophy
Force is not an external agent of compulsion but the geometry of intrinsic purpose. The universe is not a clockwork of objects being pushed and pulled, but a resonant manifold of systems continuously navigating towards their own state of maximal stability. Motion is not an effect imposed upon an object, but the object's own solution to the geometric puzzle of its existence.
