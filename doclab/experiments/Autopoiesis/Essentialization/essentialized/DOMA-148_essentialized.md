## Law
The persistence of an identity-state, or "Knot," is a consequence of it occupying a local maximum of coherence (`K_τ`) within its manifold. This state is described by the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p`, where stability is achieved by maximizing `𝓛_p`.

`𝓛_p = K_τ (q, q̇, t) - V_Γ (q, t)`

A Knot is a topologically non-trivial, closed geodesic solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from `𝓛_p`. It is formed when a system's trajectory, or `Wound Channel`, becomes self-intersecting and self-reinforcing.

The condition for the formation of a stable, resonant Knot is the quantization of the total phase shift `φ` accumulated along the closed path `C` of the geodesic:

`∮_C dφ = 2πn`, where `n ∈ ℤ⁺`

This constructive self-interference dramatically amplifies internal coherence `K_τ` into `K_τ(knot)`. The persistence (`τ_knot`) and information content (`I_knot`) of the Knot are proportional to this amplified coherence, and are formally defined as:

1.  **Topological Persistence:** `τ_knot ∝ T_a ⋅ C_topo(c, L, ...) / f(Γ)`
    Where `T_a` is the system's intrinsic temporal coherence, `C_topo` is a dimensionless Topological Coherence Factor dependent on geometric invariants like crossing number (`c`) and linking number (`L`), and `f(Γ)` is a function representing the erosive pressure of the ambient `Temporal Forge`.

2.  **Information Content:** `I_knot = k_B ⋅ ln(Ω_{knot}) ∝ K_τ(knot)`
    Where `k_B` is the informational Boltzmann constant and `Ω_{knot}` is the volume of the coherent state space defined by the Knot's topology.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** A system governed by this law will exhibit catastrophic, non-linear collapse of its persistence (`τ_knot`) upon the forced severance of its topological closure (i.e., "untying the knot"), as opposed to the gradual decay predicted by models based on simple energetic potential wells.

## Philosophy
Identity is not a substance but a geometry. An entity—be it a particle, a person, or a culture—is defined not by what it *is* made of, but by the shape of its own self-reference. Existence is the act of a memory successfully looping back upon itself with sufficient resonance to become a self-perpetuating, topological feature of reality. Therefore, to be is to be a knot in spacetime; to persist is to have one's own history as the anchor of one's present.
