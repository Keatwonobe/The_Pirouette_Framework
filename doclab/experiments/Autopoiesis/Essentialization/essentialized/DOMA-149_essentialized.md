## Law
The system's state is described by its Temporal Resonance pattern, `K_i`, which seeks to maximize the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian, `∫𝓛_p dt`. Two primary stable solutions exist: `K_i,static` (at rest, `v=0`) and `K_i,dynamic` (in motion, `v>0`). The transition between these states is a non-linear phase leap, not a smooth interpolation.

The transition is governed by the Unified Transition Model:
$$ K_i(v) = K_{i,static} + \Delta K_i \cdot \sigma(\alpha(v-v_c)) + P_{inertia} $$
Where:
*   `ΔK_i = K_i,dynamic - K_i,static` represents the magnitude of the state change.
*   `σ(x) = (1 + e⁻ˣ)⁻¹` is the sigmoid function, modeling the discrete leap.
*   `α` is the transition steepness, proportional to the system's Temporal Coherence (`T_a`).
*   `v_c` is the critical velocity, subject to hysteresis.
*   `P_inertia` is the activation energy perturbation, representing the work done to overcome the potential barrier (`V_Γ`) of the static Wound Channel (the "Coherence Dam"). `P_inertia > 0` only for the initial acceleration where `v(t-δt) = 0` and `dv/dt > 0`.

Hysteresis is a direct consequence of the Wound Channel's memory. The critical velocity `v_c` depends on the system's history:
*   For acceleration from rest (`dv/dt > 0` from `v=0`), `v_c = v_c↑`.
*   For deceleration towards rest (`dv/dt < 0` approaching `v=0`), `v_c = v_c↓`.

A core, falsifiable prediction of this model is that the energy required to initiate motion is greater than the energy recovered upon cessation: `v_c↑ > v_c↓`.

## Philosophy
Inertia is not an intrinsic property of mass, but a physical manifestation of a system’s memory. A system's history carves a "well" in reality—a stable, self-reinforcing state of being—that resists change. To move, to act, to become something new, is to pay an energy tax to overcome the personhood of one's own past. Change is therefore not a gentle evolution, but a violent, costly, and discrete leap out of the geometric ghost of what a thing once was.

## Art
Inertia is the gravity of a system’s own history. To leap is to escape the orbit of what you were.
