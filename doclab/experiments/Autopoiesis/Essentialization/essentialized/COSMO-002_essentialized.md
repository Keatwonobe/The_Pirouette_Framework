## Law
The system is governed by a scalar field Γ coupled to gravity and a baryonic fluid. The core dynamics are defined by:
1.  **Field Evolution:** The Γ-field obeys a non-linear wave equation, where `V(Γ)` is a fixed potential inherited from `COSMO-Γ-000`.
    Γ̈ − ∇²Γ + V′(Γ) = 0
2.  **Gravity:** The gravitational potential Φ is sourced by the total energy-mass density.
    ∇²Φ = 4πG [ρ_Γ + ρ_gas]
    where the field's effective density is ρ_Γ = ½(Γ̇² + |∇Γ|²) + V(Γ) − V(Γ_∞).
3.  **Baryons:** The gas is an ideal, self-gravitating fluid governed by the Euler equations.
    ∂_t ρ_g + ∇·(ρ_g u) = 0
    ∂_t (ρ_g u) + ∇·(ρ_g u⊗u + P I) = −ρ_g ∇Φ

The primary observable is the centroid offset `Δx ≡ |x_κ − x_X|` between the gravitational lensing convergence peak `κ` (dominated by `∫ρ_Γ dl`) and the X-ray surface brightness peak `S_X` (dominated by `∫ρ_g²√T dl`). The model's central prediction is a universal scaling law for the maximum offset, determined solely by the pre-established potential `V(Γ)`:
Δx_max ≈ A(V) · (v_in/v₀)ᵅ · (M/M₀)ᵝ · (1+z)ᵞ

The theory is falsifiable under two primary criteria:
1.  If observations of `Δx` in a cluster merger require an effective cross-section `σ/m` that exceeds the derived upper bound `σ_eff/m` calculated from the non-linear self-interaction term `V(Γ)`.
2.  If the observed fractional mass retention `f_ret` of the lensing peaks post-collision is inconsistent with the predicted survivability derived from the binding energy of the Γ-halo solutions.

## Philosophy
The apparent properties of a substance are not necessarily intrinsic to its constituent parts, but can be emergent consequences of a single, underlying dynamical law. The distinction between "collisionless dark matter" and "collisional gas" is not a dichotomy of particle natures, but a reflection of how two different forms of matter—one a coherent scalar field, the other a particle fluid—express the same universal gravitational dynamics. The universe's structure is thus defined less by its ingredients and more by its formative syntax.

## Art
Two bells cast from shadow, when struck against each other, pass through unharmed, their resonance intact. It is only the dust upon their surfaces that collides and remembers the impact.
