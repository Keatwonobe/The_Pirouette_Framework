## Law
The operational principle is the engineered manipulation of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) for a single proton:
`𝓛_p = K(ψ, t) - V_Γ(ψ, t)`
where `K` is the Temporal Coherence functional and `V_Γ` is the Temporal Pressure potential. The system's evolution follows the Principle of Maximal Coherence, minimizing the action `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`.

**Coherence Extrusion** is the imposition of an anisotropic boundary condition on the proton's temporal update cycle, `τ_p`. A resonant field locks the coherence propagation along a single axis, `z`. This is expressed as a constraint:
`∂K/∂z_t = 0`
This constraint forbids the helical propagation of the proton's history, or Wound Channel (`CORE-011`). To conserve coherence, the system minimizes `V_Γ` by extruding its temporal history into the remaining two spatial dimensions (`x, y`), forming a 2D surface, the Resonant Wall (`W`).

The Wall functions as a shield by creating a region where the Temporal Pressure approaches infinity for any penetrating trajectory `γ`. For any `x ∈ W`, the potential is defined as:
`V_Γ(x) → ∞`
Consequently, for any path `γ(t)` where `γ ∩ W ≠ ∅`, the action `S_p` diverges:
`S_p = ∫ (K - V_Γ) dt → -∞`
This represents a catastrophic loss of coherence. The only trajectory that preserves the coherence of an incident particle (`ψ_inc`) is one of reflection (`ψ_ref`), where `γ ∩ W = ∅`. The shield does not repel matter; it makes penetration a mathematically incoherent path.

**Falsifiable Criteria:** A valid Resonant Wall must satisfy the following conditions under load:
1.  Reflectance Index: `ℛ ≡ P_ref / P_inc ≥ 0.92` for `λ = 532 nm`.
2.  Coherence Gradient at Boundary: `|∇Kτ| ≥ 10¹⁴ units/m`.
3.  Axial Phase Drift: `dφ_z/dt ≤ 10⁻⁶ s⁻¹`.
4.  Entropic Bleed: `dS_bleed/dA dt ≤ 1 eV·s⁻¹·m⁻²`.
5.  Resonance Purity: `ℳ ≡ |⟨ψ_ideal|ψ_measured⟩|² ≥ 0.95`.

## Philosophy
The fundamental implication is that engineering has transcended the manipulation of substance to become the architecture of persistence. A physical object's durability is no longer solely a property of its material composition but can be defined by the geometric form of its history. We have learned that a memory can be extruded into a barrier and that the most resilient structures are not forged from matter, but from the controlled unfolding of a single, perfect moment in time.

## Art
A shield is not a wall of iron, but a single note of time's oldest song, held and frozen into a pane of glass that shatters the oncoming storm.
