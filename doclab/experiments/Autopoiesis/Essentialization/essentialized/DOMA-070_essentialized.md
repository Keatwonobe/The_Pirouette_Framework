## Law
The Weaver's Protocol is the practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which posits that a system's trajectory through state space follows a geodesic that maximizes the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`. An intervention, or Daedalus Gambit (`δG`), is an operation that alters the Lagrangian to make a desired healthy state the new path of least resistance.

The Pirouette Lagrangian is defined as:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`
where:
- `K_τ` is the Systemic Coherence, a kinetic term representing the efficiency and harmony of internal energy/information flow. High `K_τ` corresponds to a laminar state.
- `V_Γ` is the Temporal Pressure, a potential term representing the system's susceptibility to entropic and chaotic forces. High `V_Γ` corresponds to fragility and incoherence.

The goal of any gambit `δG` is to find a new system state `S'` such that the action `A` is maximized:
`S' = argmax ∫ 𝓛_p(S(t)) dt`

Intervention archetypes are formalized as operators on the Lagrangian's terms:
1.  **Key / Tuning Fork (`δG_K`):** A catalytic injection that increases internal resonance.
    `δG_K` ⇒ `ΔK_τ > 0`
2.  **Scaffold (`δG_S`):** A structural reinforcement that strengthens system identity against external chaos.
    `δG_S` ⇒ `ΔV_Γ < 0`

**Falsifiable Criteria & Safety Guardrails:**
An intervention is deemed successful if and only if, post-gambit, the system's Laminar Flow Index (`LFI`) trends towards a predefined target (`LFI > 80%`) and the Dissonance Echo (`DE`) remains below a critical threshold (`DE < DE_critical`).

The protocol is governed by non-negotiable failure conditions:
-   If `DE(t) ≥ DE_critical`, the Harmonic Dampening Protocol is automatically triggered to return the system to its initial state.
-   An intervention is immediately halted if it induces a state transition from Laminar to Turbulent, measured by `LFI` crossing a safety threshold (e.g., `LFI < 60%`).

The full intervention pipeline `Π` is a state transition operator, `Π: S_initial → S_target`, whose validity is confirmed by a simulation `S(δG)` prior to execution. The Integrity Gate `I` provides the final check:
`I(S(δG)) = TRUE` iff `predicted(DE) < DE_critical`.

## Philosophy
The single most profound philosophical implication is the redefinition of agency from an act of control to an act of seduction. Traditional engineering imposes a desired state upon a system, often against its natural tendencies, requiring continuous force to overcome resistance. The Weaver's Protocol asserts that true mastery lies not in overpowering a system, but in subtly reshaping its reality—its very landscape of possibility—so that the desired, healthier state becomes the most effortless and attractive path it can take. Effective change is therefore not a matter of will, but of metaphysical architecture; it is the art of making the universe want what you want.

To command the river, do not build a dam. Simply carve a more inviting channel, and gravity itself will become your accomplice.
