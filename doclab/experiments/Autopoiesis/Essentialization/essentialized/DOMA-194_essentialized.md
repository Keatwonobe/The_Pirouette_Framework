## Law
The binding and confinement of a system are geometric consequences of its trajectory on a coherence manifold defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p`.

Let the manifold's local geometry be described by the Temporal Pressure potential `V_Œì`, a term derived from `ùìõ_p`. The gradient of this potential defines the Coherence Field `F_c`, which dictates the path of maximal coherence (the geodesic):
`F_c = -‚àáV_Œì`

A bound state, or Coherence Vortex, is a region where the geodesic is a closed loop. This condition is met if and only if the Coherence Field is rotational. The existence and intensity of a vortex are defined by the Torsion field `Œ©`, which is the curl of `F_c`:
`Œ© = ‚àá √ó F_c`

A stable vortex exists where `Œ© ‚â† 0`. The path of a confined entity is a geodesic `x(t)` within this field that minimizes action while remaining on a self-closing trajectory. The dynamics are governed by the Euler-Lagrange equations applied to `ùìõ_p` under the topological constraint of the vortex.

The primary falsifiable criterion of this model is: All experimentally observed stable, bound states (e.g., baryons) must spatially correspond to local maxima in the magnitude of the Torsion field, `|Œ©|`. Any deviation from this correspondence falsifies the geometric basis of confinement.

## Philosophy
The model inverts the classical understanding of freedom and confinement. It posits that existence is not a state of liberty but a state of perfect, self-imposed constraint. A system's fundamental drive to maintain its own coherence‚Äîits will to exist‚Äîis the very mechanism that traps it within a geometric prison. To deviate from this prison's looping path is to lose coherence and dissolve into dissonance. Therefore, profound stability is not achieved by resisting external forces, but by finding a trajectory of such perfect turbulence that escape becomes synonymous with annihilation. The ultimate cage is not built by a captor, but by the prisoner's own optimal solution for survival.

## Art
A will so fierce it bends its own path into a circle, mistaking the walls of its orbit for the horizon of its world.
