## Law
The core problem is resolving the mass tension `m_H / m_L ≈ 1.7 × 10²⁹` between the leptonic-scale quantum `m_H ≈ 17 MeV` and the cosmological-scale mode `m_L ≈ 10⁻²² eV` within a single Γ sector, subject to MATH-018 predictivity constraints. Three distinct, falsifiable mechanisms are proposed:

**A. Collective Mode (Superfluid Phonon):** The `m_L` mode is an emergent, non-fundamental excitation (phonon) of a cosmic condensate formed by `m_H` quanta.
*   **Hypothesis:** The light mode is a collective excitation, not a fundamental particle.
*   **Formalism:** An effective field theory `L_eff = P(X)` with `X ≡ μ − m_H Φ − (∂θ)²/2m_H`. Linearization around a background density `n₀` yields a phonon `π` with an effective mass `m_eff` set by potential parameters, not `m_H`.
    `∂P/∂ρ|ₙ₀ = c_s²`
    `(∂_t² − c_s² ∇² + m_eff²)π = 0`
*   **Falsifiable Criteria:** A specific universal surface density `Σ₀` in halo cores, predictable vortex spectra, and medium-dependent optical effects in dense electromagnetic fields. No direct production of a `10⁻²² eV` particle.

**B. Structural Hierarchy (Clockwork/Alignment):** The `m_L` mode is the lightest physical eigenstate of a multi-scalar Γ sector whose structure generates an exponential mass hierarchy.
*   **Hypothesis:** The hierarchy is an artifact of the sector's architecture.
*   **Formalism:** A chain of `N` scalars with nearest-neighbor couplings `q`.
    `L = Σᵢ ½(∂ϕᵢ)² − ½ m²(ϕᵢ − q ϕᵢ₊₁)²`
    Diagonalization of the mass matrix `M²` yields eigenvalues `m_L² ≈ m²/q²ᴺ` and `m_H² ≈ m²`. The parameters `{q, N}` are fixed by symmetry, not observation.
*   **Falsifiable Criteria:** A specific non-universal coupling pattern `g_e : g_μ : g_τ` for `Γ_H` vs. `Γ_L`, calculable loop-level shifts in electroweak precision tests, and a predicted residual signal in Equivalence Principle tests at the `10⁻¹³ – 10⁻¹⁵` level.

**C. Historical Relic (Phase Transition):** The `m_L` mode is the ground state of the Γ field after a late-universe phase transition, with the initial `m_H` state decaying away.
*   **Hypothesis:** The effective mass is a time-dependent quantity determined by cosmic history.
*   **Formalism:** A potential `V(Γ)` with two distinct regions of curvature. The effective mass is the second derivative at the background field value: `m_eff²(t) = V''(Γ_bg(t))`. Population transfer is governed by Boltzmann equations:
    `ṅ_H + 3H n_H = −⟨σv⟩ n_H² − Γ_{H→LL} n_H`
    `ṅ_L + 3H n_L = + 2 Γ_{H→LL} n_H`
*   **Falsifiable Criteria:** A sharp, localized step-feature in the matter power spectrum at a scale `k_c` corresponding to the transition epoch `T_c`, an associated Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) signature in the CMB, and the complete absence of a contemporary `m_H` particle.

**Global Falsification:** If multi-probe analysis (CMB+BAO+WL+Precision) disconfirms the preregistered, mechanism-specific predictions for all three classes (A, B, C), the premise of Γ-sector unification is invalid.

## Philosophy
The vast, seemingly fine-tuned hierarchy between the scales of particle physics and cosmology is not a fundamental property of nature, but an emergent or structural artifact. An apparently "unnatural" constant is revealed to be the macroscopic consequence of simpler, underlying dynamics, architecture, or history. This recasts the problem of fine-tuning from one of explaining exquisitely precise values to one of understanding how complexity and disparate scales arise from a simpler, unified substrate. The distinction between a fundamental particle and a collective excitation becomes contingent on the scale of observation.

## Art
The universe does not require a ghost to scribe the laws of the cosmos and the laws of the quantum. It builds a cathedral from a single type of stone, and it is the architecture, not the stone, that determines the resonance of the void.
