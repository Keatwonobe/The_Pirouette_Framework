## Law
The retrograde involution ℛ_T acts on the spacetime manifold, partitioned into forward (𝒯_+) and retrograde (𝒯_-) sheets, as a coordinate transformation `t → −t` coupled with a sign reversal of Christoffel symbols with a single temporal index, `Γ^μ_{νρ} → −Γ^μ_{νρ}`. This operation preserves the fundamental dynamics of gravitation while inverting geometric flows.

**Even Quantities (Invariants under ℛ_T):**
- The Einstein Field Equations remain algebraically identical on both sheets:
  `G_{μν}[g] ≡ R_{μν} − (1/2)R g_{μν} = 8πG T_{μν}`
- Scalar curvature invariants, such as the Ricci scalar `R` and the Kretschmann invariant `K = R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ}`, are preserved. This implies that the magnitude of local spacetime curvature is identical for observers on 𝒯_+ and 𝒯_-.
- The covariant conservation of stress-energy, `∇_μ T^{μν}=0`, holds independently on each sheet.

**Odd Quantities (Sign-reversed under ℛ_T):**
- The extrinsic curvature tensor of a hypersurface, `K_{ij} = −n_{μ;ν} e^μ_i e^ν_j`, transforms as `K_{ij} → −K_{ij}`.
- The expansion parameter for a congruence of geodesics, `θ = ∇_μ u^μ`, transforms as `θ → −θ`. Consequently, the Raychaudhuri equation `dθ/dτ = ...` implies that gravitational focusing becomes defocusing and vice versa under ℛ_T.
- Causal ordering is reversed: the future light cone of a 𝒯_+ observer maps to the past light cone of their 𝒯_- counterpart.

**Junction and Conservation Dynamics:**
Across a `C⁰` junction between 𝒯_+ and 𝒯_-, the Israel junction conditions must hold:
`[K_ij − K g_ij] = 8πG S_ij`
where `[A] = A_+ − A_-` is the jump across the interface and `S_ij` is the stress-energy tensor of the junctional thin shell. Under ℛ_T, `K_ij → −K_{ij}`, implying that for a symmetric junction (`g_+ = g_-`), `S_{ij} → −S_{ij}`. A physical matter shell with positive surface energy on 𝒯_+ would be interpreted as having negative surface energy from 𝒯_-.
The total entropy flux across any junction is conserved in a "closed-time" sense:
`dS_+ + dS_- = 0`
This implies that entropy increase on one sheet is perfectly balanced by entropy decrease on the other.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  **Gravitational Wave Asymmetry (F1):** The theory predicts the existence of advanced-phase "retro-wave echoes" from strong gravitational events, representing leakage from 𝒯_-. The non-observation of such signals with an amplitude ratio `ε_GR` greater than the detector strain sensitivity `ε*` would falsify the model or constrain the portal strength `ε_GR`.
2.  **Horizon Thermodynamics (F2):** The Hawking radiation temperature `T_H` on 𝒯_+ must be mirrored by an equivalent rate of absorption of advanced radiation (cooling) on the corresponding 𝒯_- horizon. A violation of this reciprocal thermodynamic behavior would invalidate the retrograde duality.

## Philosophy
The arrow of time is not a fundamental property of the cosmos, but a perspectival illusion. The universe, as a whole, is time-symmetric and globally conserves information and entropy. The inexorable increase of entropy we experience—the thermodynamic arrow—is a purely local phenomenon, an artifact of our confinement to one of two equal and opposite temporal flows. Our reality is only half of a perfectly balanced equation; for every process we observe moving towards thermal equilibrium, its exact time-reversed counterpart unfolds on a conjugate manifold, creating a total system that is static and symmetric in time. Our sense of temporal passage is therefore not a discovery about the nature of reality, but a defining feature of our limited mode of perception within it.

## Art
The cosmos is a two-sided tapestry, woven with threads of cause and effect. We experience the weaving on our side as the inexorable passage of time, while on the reverse, the pattern is being perfectly un-woven.
