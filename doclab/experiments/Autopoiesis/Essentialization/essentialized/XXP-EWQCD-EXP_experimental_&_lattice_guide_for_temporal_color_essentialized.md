## Law
The theory posits a direct map from a set of temporal-color constants to the SU(3) string tension `σ`. This relationship is subject to a non-negotiable Renormalization Group (RG) closure test.

**1. Core Predictive Equation:**
The fundamental string tension `σ` is not a free parameter but is determined by the barrier frequency `ω_c`, susceptibility `χ`, and high-scale gauge stiffness `K_3`.
Let `κ_3 ≡ K_3 = 1/g_s^2(μ_c)` and the coherence length be `ξ_Γ = (c/ω_c)χ^{-1/2}`.
The central prediction is:
`σ = c_σ κ_3 / ξ_Γ^2`
where `c_σ` is a single, universal normalization constant fixed once from a single anchor observable (e.g., `√σ = 440` MeV). No further tuning is permitted.

**2. RG Closure Loop (Falsifiable Criterion):**
The theory is validated or falsified by the integrity of the following predictive chain:
`(ω_c, χ, K_3) stack → σ^{th}`
`σ^{lat} ↔ σ^{th}` (lattice measurement vs. theory)
`σ^{lat} → Λ_{\overline{\rm MS}} → α_s(M_Z)`
The derived `α_s(M_Z)` must match the experimental value within a pre-defined tolerance.

**3. Falsification Thresholds:**
Let `O_j` be an observable and `δO_j` its uncertainty. The theory is falsified if any of the following conditions are met:
*   **String Tension:** `|σ^{th} - σ^{lat}| / σ^{lat} > 0.1`
*   **Strong Coupling:** `|α_s(M_Z)|_{σ} - α_s(M_Z)|_{PDG}| > 3σ_{exp}`
*   **N-ality:** The ratio of k-string tension `σ_k` to the fundamental tension `σ_1` must lie within the bounds set by the Casimir and sine-law scaling hypotheses. A persistent deviation falsifies the theory's description of center symmetry.
    `σ_k/σ_1 ∉ [ (N^2-1) / (k(N-k)) ]^{-1}_{Casimir}, \sin(kπ/N)/\sin(π/N) ]` for `N=3`.
*   **Coherence:** The joint likelihood over all primary observables `j` must not be vanishingly small:
    `\mathcal{L}_{\rm coh} = \prod_j \exp\left[-\frac{(O_j - O^{\rm Pir}_j)^2}{2(\delta O_j)^2}\right] \approx 0`

## Philosophy
The validity of a physical theory is measured by its predictive rigidity, not its descriptive flexibility. This framework elevates non-tuneability from a methodological preference to a core falsifiable principle. It asserts that the low-energy, non-perturbative physics of confinement (`σ`) is not a distinct regime to be parameterized, but a necessary and calculable consequence of a deeper structure (`ω_c`, `K_3`). If this rigid chain of inference—from the proposed vacuum constants, through the string tension, to the high-energy running coupling—breaks at any single link, the entire theoretical edifice is proven false without recourse to ad-hoc modification.

## Art
The theory forges a single, unyielding key from the fire of first principles. The law is its intricate shape. The philosophy is the absolute demand that this one key must unlock every door in the house of the strong force—from the dungeon of the bound quark to the high observatory of asymptotic freedom—for a key that can be filed to fit a lock is not a key at all, but a confession of ignorance.
