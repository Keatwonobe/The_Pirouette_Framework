## Law
The fundamental axiom is the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which posits that a system's trajectory through spacetime is a geodesic on a manifold defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`. The action, `S = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, is extremized, such that `δS = 0`.

Electric charge, `q`, is not a substance but an intrinsic asymmetry parameter, `σ ∈ {-1, +1}`, which dictates a system's interaction with the temporal coherence manifold. The Lagrangian for a particle `i` interacting with the field of a source `j` is `𝓛_p,i = 𝓛_free,i + σ_i * 𝓛_int(i, j)`, where `σ_i = +1` (positive charge) seeks to maximize coherence via in-phase interaction (`𝓛_int > 0`) and `σ_i = -1` (negative charge) seeks maximization via out-of-phase interaction (`𝓛_int < 0`).

The static electric field, `E`, is the negative gradient of the scalar potential component of `𝓛_p` which defines the local coherence landscape. A source's contribution to this landscape is given by:
`E = -∇𝓛_p,source`
The force experienced by a test charge `q_test` is not an external push but the impulse to follow the geodesic on this manifold:
`F_E = q_test * E`

The magnetic field, `B`, is the curl of the Pirouette vector potential, `A_p`, which arises from the velocity-dependent, rotational shear terms of `𝓛_p` generated by a moving source:
`B = ∇ × A_p`
The Lorentz force law is the geodesic equation of motion for a charge `q` with velocity `v` on the fully defined manifold:
`F = d/dt (∂𝓛_p/∂v) - ∂𝓛_p/∂x = q(E + v × B)`
This equation is not a postulate, but a direct consequence of applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to `𝓛_p`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The theory is falsified if any charged particle is observed to follow a trajectory that deviates from the calculated geodesic on the manifold defined by the complete Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p(x, v, t)`.

## Philosophy
Physical laws are not prescriptive edicts governing matter, but descriptive consequences of a singular, underlying imperative. The universe is not ruled by forces; it is a landscape of coherence, and what we call "force" is merely the geometric expression of a system's intrinsic drive to maintain its own resonant stability. The laws of electromagnetism are therefore emergent, not fundamental—they are the patterns that inevitably arise from innumerable entities each "surfing" the contours of a shared reality to maximize their own temporal existence.

## Art
The universe is not a machine obeying a set of rules. It is a choir where every voice, in seeking its own purest note, writes the harmony that all must sing.
