## Law
The total anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton `â„“` is decomposed as:
`a_\ell = a_\ell^{\text{SM}} + \Delta a_\ell^{(\Gamma)}`
where `a_\ell^{\text{SM}}` is the Standard Model contribution and `\Delta a_\ell^{(\Gamma)}` is the contribution from the Pirouette Framework's Pressuron (`\Gamma`). This new physics contribution is given by the one-loop term:
`\Delta a_\ell^{(\Gamma)} = \frac{\alpha}{12\pi^2} \kappa^2 \left(\frac{m_\ell}{m_e}\right)^{2p} f\left(\frac{m_\Gamma}{m_\ell}\right)`
Here, `\kappa` is the fundamental pressuron coupling constant, `p` is the mass-scaling exponent, `m_\Gamma` is the pressuron mass, and `f(r)` is a dimensionless shape function with the properties `f(0)=1` and `f(r \gg 1) \propto 1/r^2`, ensuring decoupling.

The framework is subjected to a two-step falsifiable test:
1.  **Calibration:** The free parameters `(\kappa, p, m_\Gamma)` are constrained by solving for the experimentally observed muon anomaly, `\Delta a_\mu^{\text{exp}} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-9}`. This defines a solution surface `S`:
    `S = \{(\kappa, p, m_\Gamma) \mid \Delta a_\mu^{(\Gamma)}(\kappa, p, m_\Gamma) = \Delta a_\mu^{\text{exp}}\}`
2.  **Validation & Falsification:** For any point on the surface `S`, a prediction is made for the electron anomaly. The theory is falsified if this prediction violates the experimental null result for the electron. The survival criterion is:
    `|\Delta a_e^{(\Gamma)}(\kappa, p, m_\Gamma)| < |\Delta a_e^{\text{residual}}| \quad \forall (\kappa, p, m_\Gamma) \in S`
    where `\Delta a_e^{\text{residual}}` represents the uncertainty bounds on new physics from the electron `g-2` measurement.

Application of this law to experimental data yields a unique solution "island," winnowing the parameter space to:
*   `p = 1`
*   `m_\Gamma \approx 17 \text{ MeV}`

## Philosophy
The validity of a physical theory is not established by its capacity to accommodate phenomena, but by its predictive fragility. By forcing its free parameters to be measured by one empirical anomaly (the muon's), the framework becomes rigidly determined, sacrificing its plasticity. Its subsequent, unadjusted success in predicting a second, independent, and far more stringent empirical constraint (the electron's) demonstrates that the theory is not merely a flexible description, but a coherent and non-trivial reflection of reality's structure.

## Art
We found a single key, cut to fit the strange lock of the muon. When we turned it, a different door swung open across the hall, revealing the pristine chamber of the electron.
