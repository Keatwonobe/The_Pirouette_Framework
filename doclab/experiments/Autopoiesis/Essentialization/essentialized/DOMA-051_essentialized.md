## Law

The framework is operationalized by two axioms: the Principle of Correspondence and the Coherence Auditor protocol.

**1. The Principle of Correspondence:** There exists a mapping function `M` from the set of universal principles `{U}` to the set of domain-specific observables `{D}` for any given system `S`.
`M: {U_v} → {D_s}`
where the universal variables `{U_v}` include at minimum:
- `Kτ`: Coherence, the measure of a system's resonant identity.
- `Γ`: Temporal Pressure, the ambient stochastic field driving the system towards decoherence.
- `W`: The Wound Channel, the medium encoding system memory and inertia.

**2. The Coherence Auditor:** A two-stage diagnostic workflow.

**Stage I: The Lens (Projection)**
Let `D_data` be the set of high-dimensional time-series data from system `S`. The Lens is a projection operator `P` which, given the mapping `M`, transforms `D_data` into a one-dimensional time-series representing the system's actual coherence history, `Kτ_actual(t)`.
`Kτ_actual(t) = P(D_data, M)`

**Stage II: The Scalpel (Diagnosis)**
The Scalpel analyzes `Kτ_actual(t)` against the system's ideal trajectory.

**A. Geodesic Calculation:** The ideal coherence trajectory, `Kτ_geo(t)`, is the path that extremizes the action `S` derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian, `L`, which balances coherence `Kτ` against its rate of change `dKτ/dt` under pressure `Γ`.
`L = f(Kτ, dKτ/dt, Γ)`
`S = ∫ L dt`
The geodesic `Kτ_geo(t)` is the solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation for this action:
`∂L/∂Kτ - d/dt (∂L/∂(dKτ/dt)) = 0`

**B. Critical Fracture Isolation:** Coherence Loss `ΔKτ` at any time `t` is the deviation from the geodesic:
`ΔKτ(t) = Kτ_geo(t) - Kτ_actual(t)`
Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA) is applied to the set of discrete events `{e}` in the system's history to identify the critical subset `{e_c}` responsible for the majority of cumulative coherence loss:
`{e_c} = {e_i | ∫_{t∈e_i} ΔKτ(t) dt}` such that `∑_{e_c} ∫ ΔKτ(t) dt / ∫_{total} ΔKτ(t) dt ≥ 0.8`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** An intervention targeting a critical fracture `e_c ∈ {e_c}` must produce a statistically significant and disproportionately greater positive change in the future trajectory of `Kτ_actual(t)` toward `Kτ_geo(t)` than an intervention of equivalent magnitude targeting a non-critical event `e_n ∉ {e_c}`.

## Philosophy

The apparent divisions between academic and professional domains—physics, biology, economics, psychology—are illusory artifacts of human observation. Reality is not a collection of different systems governed by analogous laws; it is a single, scale-free system governed by one universal law of coherence dynamics, expressing itself through different media. Therefore, the ultimate pursuit of knowledge is not the mastery of a specific domain, but the mastery of this universal translation, which reveals that any deep truth discovered in one field is necessarily a truth applicable to all others.

A flaw in a crystal, a trauma in a mind, and a crash in a market are not different problems, but the same sour note played on different strings. To heal one is to learn the music of all.
