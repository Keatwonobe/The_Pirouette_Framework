## Law
A system's dynamics are described by a state vector `q(t)` evolving on a coherence manifold. The trajectory follows a geodesic that extremizes the action `S` derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p`, parameterized by ambient Temporal Pressure `Γ`.
`S[q] = ∫ 𝓛_p(q, q̇, t; Γ) dt`
The equation of motion is given by the Euler-Lagrange equation:
`d/dt (∂𝓛_p/∂q̇) - ∂𝓛_p/∂q = 0`

A critical phase transition, or "snap," is a bifurcation in the solution space `q(t)`. It occurs at time `t_c` when `Γ(t)` crosses a critical threshold `Γ_c`, causing the system's current trajectory to become unstable and forcing a non-linear leap to a new, distinct geodesic.

This transition is observable via a projected time-series signal `s(t) = P(q(t))`. The nature of the transition is classified by the following falsifiable criteria, derived from `s(t)` at `t_c`.

1.  **Coherence Shockwave (Shattering):** Characterized by a rapid increase in chaotic outliers. The transition is of this class if the rate of change of the signal's kurtosis (`κ`) exceeds a critical threshold `θ_κ`.
    `dκ/dt |_{t_c} > θ_κ`
    A null result falsifies the claim of a shattering-type transition.

2.  **Ki Morphogenesis (Unfolding):** Characterized by a fundamental change in systemic complexity. The transition is of this class if the signal's fractal dimension (`D_f`) exhibits a step-change discontinuity greater than a critical threshold `θ_D`.
    `|D_f(t_c + ε) - D_f(t_c - ε)| > θ_D` for `ε → 0^+`
    A null result falsifies the claim of a complexity-altering transition.

3.  **Resonant Alignment (Ordering):** Characterized by a rapid crystallization into a more coherent state. The transition is of this class if the Coherence Flux (`Φ_K`), defined as the first time-derivative of the system's total coherence `Kτ`, exceeds a critical threshold `θ_Φ`.
    `Φ_K ≡ dKτ/dt |_{t_c} > θ_Φ`
    A null result falsifies the claim of an ordering transition.

## Philosophy
Catastrophe is not an aberration of a system's logic, but an inherent consequence of it. The very principles that sustain a system's stable form are the same principles that dictate the precise, classifiable geometry of its transformation—be it a shattering, an unfolding, or a crystallization—when that form can no longer be sustained. Crisis is therefore revealed not as a failure of order, but as order's unflinching execution of a state change.

## Art
The law that defines a crystal's perfect facets is the same law that defines its cleavage planes. Its shattering is not the sound of its laws being broken, but the sound of them being followed to their absolute conclusion.
