## Law
The behavior of an ionospheric plasma plume is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The plume's trajectory is the geodesic that maximizes its Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, over time, such that `δ∫𝓛_p dt = 0`.

The plume Lagrangian is defined as:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Where:
-   **`K_τ` (Temporal Coherence)** is the measure of the system's internal order and persistence. It is measured via its geometric efficiency, which is inversely proportional to its fractal dimension, `D`:
    `K_τ ∝ D⁻¹`

-   **`V_Γ` (Temporal Pressure)** is the potential energy cost imposed by the ambient environment. It is directly proportional to the measured local energy density from external inputs, `Γ_env`:
    `V_Γ ∝ Γ_env`

From this, the primary diagnostic is the Plume Coherence Index (PCI), a dimensionless ratio quantifying systemic health:
`PCI = K_τ / V_Γ`

This framework yields the following falsifiable criteria for flow state classification based on the observable fractal dimension `D`:
-   **Laminar State:** `D ≈ 1.1–1.3`. The system is successfully maximizing `𝓛_p`.
-   **Turbulent State:** `D ≥ 1.7`. The system is failing, `K_τ` is collapsing, and `𝓛_p` is minimized.

## Philosophy
The geometry of a physical system is not a static property to be measured, but the tangible record of its existential purpose. Form is a dynamic strategy for persistence against dissolution, and a system’s shape is the most efficient solution it has found to the problem of its own existence. Therefore, to analyze a system's structure is to reverse-engineer its will to live.
