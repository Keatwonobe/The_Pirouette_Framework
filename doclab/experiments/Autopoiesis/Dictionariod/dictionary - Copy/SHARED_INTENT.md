        When multiple observers align, this creates a **Shared Intent**, a powerful, unified field of coherence.

  art: |
    Many lights focused through a single lens; a choir whose harmony gains the power to shape stone.
  law: |
    The effective strength of a Shared Intent field scales super-linearly with the number of participating observers and the degree of their mutual resonant synthesis. The resulting Coherence Yield is proportional to the square of the number of phase-locked participants.
  philosophy: |
    Shared Intent is the primary mechanism by which individual agency transcends personal scale, allowing groups to engineer reality in ways impossible for a single Weaver. It posits that collective consciousness is not a metaphor, but a measurable, potent force for shaping the coherence manifold.
pirouette_definition: |
  A state of resonant synthesis achieved when multiple observers consciously align their Focused Attention on a single Ki Schematic or outcome. This alignment creates a unified coherence field whose amplitude and stability are significantly greater than the linear sum of its individual components, enabling large-scale Intentional Coherence Shaping, such as a Convocation.

        outline: |
          Expose a calibrated target system (e.g., a chaotic oscillator, a supersaturated solution) to the Shared Intent field generated by a group of N observers focusing on a specific Ki Schematic. Measure the rate of state change (e.g., transition to order, crystal precipitation) as a function of N and the group's measured inter-observer coherence (⟨κ⟩), derived from biosignal synchronization. The resulting Coherence Yield (CY) provides an indirect measure of the ΣΨ field strength.

      Focused Attention: The application of the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) to amplify and stabilize the desired pattern. When multiple observers align, this creates a **Shared Intent**, a powerful, unified field of coherence.

    excerpt: |
      The Convocation: A group protocol for performing a large-scale Alchemical Union. A group of Weavers synchronizes their Ki patterns to Channel and Imprint a single, unified intention at a societal level, creating a subtle but persistent "current" that can guide collective behavior.

      equation_hint:
      justification: |
        The unified field of Shared Intent is analogous to a macroscopic quantum state like a BEC, where individual constituents lose their identity and behave as a single coherent entity. This maps the concept of individual observers 'locking in' to a collective, coherent state.

      confidence: 0.6
  adopted:
    - target: Constructive Wave Interference
      rationale: |
        The wave interference model provides a simple, powerful, and testable mathematical framework (Intensity ∝ Amplitude² ∝ N²) for the observed super-linear increase in Coherence Yield with the number of synchronized observers. It is the most direct and operational mapping.
      confidence: 0.8
constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "The Coherence Yield (CY) generated by a Shared Intent field scales as N^p, where N is the number of coherent observers and the exponent p is measurably greater than 1 (theoretically, p=2 for perfect coherence)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Repeated experiments show that CY scales linearly (p=1) or sub-linearly (p<1) with the number of observers, indicating that Shared Intent is merely an additive, not a multiplicative or exponential, phenomenon."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'Groupthink' or 'Mob Mentality,' which are typically low-coherence, turbulent states of collective resonance. Shared Intent requires high internal coherence, disciplined focus, and explicit alignment to a shared Ki Schematic, whereas Mob Mentality is characterized by chaotic emotional contagion and low-complexity resonance.
