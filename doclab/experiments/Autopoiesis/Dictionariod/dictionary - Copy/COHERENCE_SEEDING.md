        This module focuses on 'Coherence Seeding'‚Äîthe process of establishing a stable, self-sustaining rhythm of movement and self-monitoring to guide the patient from a state of stillness into a gentle, restorative flow.

triad:
  art: |
    The river was calmed to stillness; now we show it the most natural and efficient path to follow, carving a new channel not by force, but by a gentle, steady current.
  law: |
    Consistent, low-intensity activity at a conversational pace will produce a monotonic decrease in resting heart rate and increase in subjective flow scores when tracked over weeks, establishing a self-sustaining recovery rhythm.
  philosophy: |
    To bridge the gap between passive healing and active wellness by transforming a conscious, fragile effort into an unconscious, resilient habit of health. It is the art of making recovery an automatic, self-reinforcing process.
pirouette_definition: |
  The process of establishing a stable, self-sustaining rhythm of gentle movement and self-monitoring in a system (e.g., a recovering patient) to guide it from a state of static recovery into a restorative, self-reinforcing flow. It is achieved by prioritizing consistency over intensity to carve a 'Wound Channel'‚Äîa new, efficient energetic pathway‚Äîthereby strengthening Temporal Coherence (KœÑ) and creating positive Lagrangian momentum (ùìõ_p).

        outline: |
          1. Daily, upon waking and before activity, record Resting Heart Rate (RHR).
          2. Daily, at a consistent time, record a subjective "Flow Score" (1-10) on ease of movement and general well-being.
          3. At the end of each week, plot both time series on a line graph to visualize the trend, ignoring daily noise.
        expected_signals: [A negative slope on the RHR trendline, A positive slope on the Flow Score trendline]
        pitfalls: [Patient discouragement from daily fluctuations obscuring the weekly trend, Inconsistent measurement times or conditions (e.g., after caffeine) skewing RHR data]

    excerpt: |
      Goal 1: Seed a New Rhythm. The primary goal is to teach your body a new, healthy pattern of movement. This is your new "song" of health, your stable Ki. Goal 2: Carve the Channel. With every repetition of this new rhythm, you are carving a "groove" or a "riverbed" in the landscape of your own being. This is your Wound Channel. The deeper we carve this channel through gentle practice, the easier it will be for your body to follow this healthy path automatically.
  - module: DOMA-HLTH-003
    excerpt: |
      Every step you take, every time you reinforce your new healthy rhythm (Ki), you are strengthening your internal Temporal Coherence (KœÑ). Your body is becoming more efficient. It is no longer wasting all its energy on the turbulence of healing and is now able to invest that energy in building strength and stability. Your Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) is becoming positive again. This surplus of coherence is the momentum that will carry you.

        Coherence Seeding aims to find and reinforce a 'geodesic' path for recovery‚Äîthe most efficient, least effortful rhythm. This mirrors how a physical system evolves along a path of stationary action. The process increases system efficiency (KœÑ), effectively optimizing the Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) for the patient's 'action' of living.

  disambiguation: |
    "Seeding" implies the initiation of a self-sustaining process, akin to planting a seed that grows on its own. It is distinct from later-phase "strengthening" or "conditioning" which focuses on increasing intensity and capacity. Coherence Seeding is about establishing the *pattern*, not maximizing its output.

# Coherence Seeding

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The process of establishing a stable, self-sustaining rhythm of gentle movement and self-monitoring in a system (e.g., a recovering patient) to guide it from a state of static recovery into a restorative, self-reinforcing flow. It is achieved by prioritizing consistency over intensity to carve a 'Wound Channel'‚Äîa new, efficient energetic pathway‚Äîthereby strengthening Temporal Coherence (KœÑ) and creating positive Lagrangian momentum (ùìõ_p).

## EFT-First Summary
In a low-energy recovery regime, the patient's system can be modeled with a simplified Lagrangian (ùìõ_p). Coherence Seeding is the process of finding and reinforcing a stable, low-cost dynamic trajectory (a 'geodesic'). This enhances Temporal Coherence (KœÑ), analogous to a kinetic term becoming more efficient, allowing the system to build positive momentum rather than dissipating energy in chaotic fluctuations. It is an operational method for optimizing the path of stationary action for a biological system, consistent with the Principle of Stationary Action in classical mechanics.
