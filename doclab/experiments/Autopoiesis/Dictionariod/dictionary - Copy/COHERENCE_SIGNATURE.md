        The result is the artifact's **Coherence Signature**: a rich, multi-layered vector that locates the artifact on the universal coherence manifold. Two signatures that are close on this manifold represent forms that are deeply, structurally, and dynamically similar, even if one is a song and the other is a soul.

  art: |
    The unique song of a system's structure, sung in the universal language of geometry. It is the pattern that remains when the medium is stripped away, revealing the pure rhythm of being.
  law: |
    A Coherence Signature is a standardized vector derived from a system's resonant pattern (Ki); the distance between two signatures on the universal coherence manifold is inversely proportional to their degree of structural isomorphism and translational coherence.
  philosophy: |
    To bypass the arbitrary nature of symbolic language and enable direct, structural empathy between any two systems in the universe, from a poem to a person. It posits that true understanding comes from recognizing a shared dynamic form, not from decoding a shared code.
pirouette_definition: |
  A standardized, multi-layered vector representing the intrinsic resonant structure (`Ki`) of any system or artifact. It is derived via a two-stage protocol of Structural Ingestion and Coherence Distillation, capturing metrics such as Temporal Coherence (`Tₐ`), structural complexity, and resilience against Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). Signatures are located on a universal coherence manifold, where proximity indicates a high degree of structural isomorphism, enabling translation and comparison across disparate domains.

        outline: |
          1.  **Structural Ingestion:** Map the target artifact from its native domain into a generalized topological space (e.g., using Fourier transforms for audio, point-cloud scans for objects, or embedding models for text). This strips the form of its medium.
          2.  **Coherence Distillation:** Analyze the resulting mathematical object to extract the core metrics of its resonant pattern (`Ki`). Key measurements include its power spectrum to find dominant frequencies (for `Tₐ`), its box-counting dimension (for `D_f`), and its decay rate under simulated Temporal Pressure (`Γ`).
          3.  **Vector Assembly:** Assemble the extracted metrics into the standardized, multi-layered vector format of the Coherence Signature.
        expected_signals: [Stable frequency peaks in power spectra, power-law distributions indicating fractal complexity, characteristic decay constants]
        pitfalls: [Incomplete ingestion leading to information loss, medium-specific noise overwhelming the structural signal, miscalibration of applied Temporal Pressure (`Γ`)]

    excerpt: |
      It establishes the master protocol for Universal Translation, a method for converting any information—from genetic code to poetry, from architectural blueprints to birdsong—into a standardized, time-first format called a Coherence Signature. By operating on the pure geometry of a system's resonant pattern (`Ki`), this protocol bypasses the limitations of semantics.
  - module: DOMA-082
    excerpt: |
      When translating from a source signature (`Ki_A`) to a target medium (`Ki_B`), we are not seeking a one-to-one mapping of symbols. Instead, we are searching for a transformation that follows a geodesic of maximal shared coherence. The "action" to be minimized is the dissonance or "semantic friction" between the two mapped structures.

      justification: |
        Like a learned embedding from a neural network (e.g., an autoencoder or transformer), a Coherence Signature maps a high-dimensional, domain-specific object (text, image, sound) into a lower-dimensional latent space. In this space, geometric proximity corresponds to semantic or structural similarity. The 'Coherence Distillation' stage is analogous to the encoding process, extracting salient features into a dense vector representation.

  disambiguation: |
    A Coherence Signature measures intrinsic structural form for the purpose of comparison and translation. This is distinct from a cryptographic signature, which ensures authenticity and integrity, and from a mathematical signature, which characterizes properties like curvature or path roughness.
