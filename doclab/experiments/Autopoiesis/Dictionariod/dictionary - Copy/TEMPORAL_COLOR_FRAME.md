  art: |
    Color is time’s threefold braid. The temporal-color frame is the local set of axes for this internal, braided time. Its twisting and stiffness give rise to the strong force.
  law: |
    The existence of a threefold degenerate frame requires an SU(3) connection field to maintain synchronization. The energy cost of de-synchronization (field strength) is determined by the frame's mechanical stiffness (`κ₃`). Condensation of Z₃ topological defects in this frame forces an area law for Wilson loops, with string tension `σ` scaling as `σ ~ κ₃/ξ_Γ²`.
  philosophy: |
    This concept re-interprets SU(3) color symmetry not as a fundamental charge, but as a geometric consequence of a degenerate temporal structure within the vacuum. It grounds the dynamics of the strong force in the mechanical properties (stiffness, coherence) of the Pirouette substrate, linking QCD phenomenology to deeper physical scales.
pirouette_definition: |
  A local, three-dimensional basis spanning the degenerate shear modes of the internal resonance sector. The frame's orientation at any spacetime point `x` is a gauge redundancy, synchronized with neighboring points by the SU(3) color connection `A_μ`. Its effective elastic modulus, or frame stiffness `κ₃`, is inversely proportional to the squared strong coupling constant, `κ₃ = 1/g_s²`.

        outline: |
          1. Perform lattice QCD simulations on an anisotropic lattice, where the temporal lattice spacing `a_t` is varied relative to the spatial spacing `a_s`.
          2. Map this anisotropy to controlled deformations of the frame stiffness `κ₃` and coherence length `ξ_Γ`.
          3. Measure the fundamental string tension `σ` from the area law of large Wilson loops for each set of lattice parameters.
          4. Fit the results to the scaling law `σ = c_σ * κ₃/ξ_Γ²` to verify the mechanical model and extract the constants.
        expected_signals: [A clear scaling of `σ` with the lattice parameters corresponding to `κ₃` and `ξ_Γ`.]
        pitfalls: [Discretization artifacts, difficulty in cleanly separating the effects of `κ₃` and `ξ_Γ` from other lattice artifacts.]

    excerpt: |
      The **string tension** is controlled by two mechanical scales: **Frame stiffness** (temporal-color): `κ₃` or equivalently `g_s(μ)`, and **Γ-coherence length** (vortex core/penetration depth): `ξ_Γ`. Interpretation: stiffer temporal-color frames (smaller `g_s`) and shorter Γ-coherence (smaller `ξ_Γ`) both increase `σ`, tightening the flux tube.

      justification: |
        The temporal-color frame at each point `x` defines a 3D complex vector space. The set of all possible orthonormal bases for this space is the SU(3) group manifold. The collection of these fiber spaces over spacetime forms an SU(3) principal bundle, with the gauge field `A_μ` being the connection that defines parallel transport between fibers.

    Distinguish from the 'color-flavor locked' frame in high-density QCD, which relates color and flavor degrees of freedom. The temporal-color frame is a pre-quark concept of the vacuum, relating the origin of color to the structure of the medium's internal time.

# Temporal-color frame

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A local, three-dimensional basis spanning the degenerate shear modes of the internal resonance sector. The frame's orientation at any spacetime point `x` is a gauge redundancy, synchronized with neighboring points by the SU(3) color connection `A_μ`. Its effective elastic modulus, or frame stiffness `κ₃`, is inversely proportional to the squared strong coupling constant, `κ₃ = 1/g_s²`.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of gauge theory, the temporal-color frame is the fiber of the SU(3) principal bundle of QCD. The Pirouette framework re-interprets this mathematical structure as a physical, degenerate basis of the medium's internal dynamics. The Yang-Mills action arises from the mechanical stiffness (`κ₃ = 1/g_s²`) required to synchronize frame orientations via the connection `A_μ`, providing a mechanical origin for the strong coupling constant.
