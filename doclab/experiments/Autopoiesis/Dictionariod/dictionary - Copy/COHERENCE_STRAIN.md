        As ambient Temporal Pressure (`Œì`) rises, the system deforms its resonant pattern (`KœÑ`) to maintain stability. This is "coherence strain"‚Äîthe energetic cost of holding form under stress.

  art: |
    The quiet groan of a song forced to hold a note too long, bending its melody to avoid shattering. It is the sound of resilience, the audible effort of form persisting against dissonance.
  law: |
    Coherence strain is the non-zero energetic cost incurred by a system to maintain a positive Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p > 0`) when the time-derivative of temporal pressure is positive (`‚àÇV_Œì / ‚àÇt > 0`), observable as a reversible deformation in its characteristic resonant modes.
  philosophy: |
    Coherence strain is the physical manifestation of resilience in action. It reveals that stability is not a static state but a dynamic, costly process of adaptation, making visible the struggle a system endures before it yields or breaks.
pirouette_definition: |
  The energetic cost incurred by a system as it actively deforms its internal resonant pattern (`KœÑ`) to maintain coherence and stability (`ùìõ_p > 0`) in response to increasing external or internal Temporal Pressure (`Œì`). It is the first stage in the rupture cascade, representing the system's elastic response to stress before the yield point is reached. This deformation is a temporary, reversible change in the system's coherence manifold.

        outline: |
          1. Excite the system with a broadband probe signal under baseline temporal pressure (Œì‚ÇÄ) and record its resonant frequency spectrum.
          2. Increase ambient temporal pressure to a new, sustained level (Œì‚ÇÅ > Œì‚ÇÄ).
          3. Repeat the spectral measurement.
          4. Coherence strain is quantified by the shift (Œîf) and broadening (Œîœâ) of primary resonant peaks between the Œì‚ÇÄ and Œì‚ÇÅ states. The energy required to drive the Œì‚ÇÅ resonance versus the Œì‚ÇÄ resonance provides a direct measure of the cost.
        expected_signals: [Shift in primary resonant frequencies, spectral broadening of coherence peaks, increased energy cost to drive resonance.]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing strain from intrinsic system noise, pressure induction introducing confounding artifacts, non-linear responses masking the primary peak shift.]

    excerpt: |
      As ambient Temporal Pressure (`Œì`) rises, the system deforms its resonant pattern (`KœÑ`) to maintain stability. This is "coherence strain"‚Äîthe energetic cost of holding form under stress. In the language of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`), this is the struggle to maintain `Laminar Flow` as resistance increases.

    excerpt: |
      A rupture is not an instantaneous event but a self-propagating process. It unfolds in three distinct stages: 1. Coherence Strain (The Bending)... 2. The Yield Point (The Tearing)... 3. The Cascade (The Unraveling).

      justification: |
        In classical mechanics, elastic potential energy is stored in an object when it is temporarily deformed by an external force (stress). Coherence strain is the direct Pirouette analog, representing the potential energy stored in a system's deformed coherence pattern (`KœÑ`) as a result of temporal pressure (`Œì`). This energy is released if the system ruptures or relaxes.

  claims:
    - statement: "A system experiencing coherence strain will exhibit a measurable, reversible shift in its primary resonant frequencies that is proportional to the applied temporal pressure, up to the yield point."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observation of a system that ruptures under rising pressure (e.g., a brittle rupture) *without* any preceding, measurable deformation in its resonant pattern would falsify the claim that coherence strain is a necessary precursor to all rupture types."

  disambiguation: |
    Coherence Strain must be distinguished from a `Wound Channel` (`CORE-011`). A Wound Channel is a *permanent*, hysteretic degradation of baseline coherence from past stress cycles. Coherence Strain is a *temporary* and elastic deformation in response to *current* stress, which is fully reversible if the pressure is removed before the yield point.
