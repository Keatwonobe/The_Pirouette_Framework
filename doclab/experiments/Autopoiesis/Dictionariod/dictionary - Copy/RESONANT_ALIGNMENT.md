    Like the chime of a crystal forming in darkness, it is the sound of disparate parts finding their harmony. It is the flash of insight where scattered thoughts suddenly lock into a coherent, elegant whole.
  law: |
    A system undergoes Resonant Alignment if and only if its Coherence Flux (dKτ/dt) exhibits a rapid, non-linear, positive spike, resulting in a persistent, higher-coherence steady state.
  philosophy: |
    Resonant Alignment signifies that transformation is not always chaotic or destructive. It is the signature of constructive emergence—proof that under pressure, systems can discover more elegant and complex ways of being, creating order from potential.
pirouette_definition: |
  A class of critical phase transition characterized by the spontaneous, cooperative self-organization of a system's components into a more complex and coherent whole. This "white swan" event is the observable signature of a successful Alchemical Union (CORE-012), where disparate elements phase-lock into a new, higher-order resonant state. It is one of the three primary transition signatures, distinct from the destructive Coherence Shockwave and the rule-changing Ki Morphogenesis.

          1. Establish a stable baseline of the system's integrated coherence (Kτ) during Laminar Flow.
          2. Compute the first time-derivative (dKτ/dt) in a moving window.
          3. Monitor for a rapid, non-linear spike in dKτ/dt that exceeds a statistically defined threshold (e.g., > 5σ above baseline noise).
          4. Confirm the transition by verifying that the post-spike integrated coherence (Kτ) settles at a new, measurably higher plateau.

    excerpt: |
      This instrument teaches the Weaver to listen with a physicist's ear, to distinguish the sound of a shattering window from a seed pod bursting open, the groan of a collapsing bridge from the chime of a crystal being formed. It teaches us that profound change is not a random tremor, but a geometric inevitability... knowing, by the resonance of the snap, the difference between an ending and a beginning.

        In physics, a system in a symmetric state (e.g., a fluid) can suddenly transition into a less symmetric, more ordered state (e.g., a crystal) when a parameter like temperature is changed. This directly maps to disparate parts snapping into a coherent whole under Temporal Pressure, increasing order (Kτ).

      justification: |
        The Kuramoto model describes how a large population of independent oscillators can spontaneously lock into a common frequency. This is a direct mathematical analog for how disordered system components can phase-lock and achieve a state of high coherence (Resonant Alignment). The order parameter in the model is analogous to Kτ.

    Unlike a **Coherence Shockwave**, which is a destructive shattering of order, Resonant Alignment is constructive. Unlike **Ki Morphogenesis**, which involves a change in the system's fundamental rules (topology), Resonant Alignment is an emergent ordering *within* the existing ruleset.

# Resonant Alignment

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A class of critical phase transition characterized by the spontaneous, cooperative self-organization of a system's components into a more complex and coherent whole. This "white swan" event is the observable signature of a successful Alchemical Union (CORE-012), where disparate elements phase-lock into a new, higher-order resonant state. It is one of the three primary transition signatures, distinct from the destructive Coherence Shockwave and the rule-changing Ki Morphogenesis.

## EFT-First Summary
Resonant Alignment is conceptually and mathematically analogous to phenomena like **spontaneous symmetry breaking** and **phase-locking** in complex systems. Just as coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model can suddenly synchronize, or a supercooled liquid can spontaneously crystallize, a system under Temporal Pressure can transition from a disordered state to a highly ordered, coherent state. This is measured by a sharp, positive spike in the first time-derivative of the system's coherence (Coherence Flux, dKτ/dt), signifying a rapid, collective ordering of its constituent parts into a new, more stable configuration.
