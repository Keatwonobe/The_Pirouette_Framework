  art: |
    The river of flesh and signal, the measurable current of life. It is the body's unvarnished truth, the physical scripture against which intention is tested.
  law: |
    Body蛇 is the state vector of all measurable physiological variables (e.g., heart rate, LVEF, mean aortic gradient) that anchor a rehabilitation process. Its trajectory must show positive change for total coherence (Kτ) to be certifiably increased.
  philosophy: |
    Without the anchor of Body蛇, Will蛇 becomes an unmoored fantasy. Healing requires the physical vessel to validate and sustain the intention to recover, grounding purpose in material reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  The physiological component of the Caduceus Lens, representing the body's objective state and capacity. Body蛇 is tracked through a composite of clinical and biometric data, forming one half of the feedback loop with its counterpart, Will蛇. Its state determines the system's tolerance for Temporal Pressure (Γ) and reflects the material basis of Coherence (Kτ).

        outline: |
          A comprehensive assessment to establish the initial state of Body蛇. This involves collecting vital signs (HR, BP, O₂ sat), functional metrics (e.g., METS, reps/sets), and specialized clinical data relevant to the condition (e.g., echocardiographic data like LVEF, aortic gradient for cardiac rehab). Data is logged pre-, mid-, and post-intervention.

        pitfalls: [Over-reliance on a single metric, failing to correlate data with the patient's Will蛇 state, instrument error or inconsistent measurement timing.]

        Body蛇 represents the set of measurable outputs of a biological system at a given time, analogous to a state vector `x(t)` in control theory. The Pirouette Prescription (the input `u`) is designed to drive this state vector from a post-trauma state to a desired coherent setpoint.

  disambiguation: |
    Body蛇 is the objective, measurable, physiological component ("the body's report"). It must not be confused with Will蛇, which is the subjective, intentional, and psychological component ("the patient's narrative"). They are counterparts, not synonyms.

# Body蛇

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The physiological component of the Caduceus Lens, representing the body's objective state and capacity. Body蛇 is tracked through a composite of clinical and biometric data, forming one half of the feedback loop with its counterpart, Will蛇. Its state determines the system's tolerance for Temporal Pressure (Γ) and reflects the material basis of Coherence (Kτ).

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Body蛇 maps to the state vector **x**(t) in control theory. It is a set of measurable physiological variables that define the system's current state. Rehabilitation protocols act as control inputs designed to steer this state vector from an initial post-trauma condition toward a target region of the state space defined by high coherence and stability.
