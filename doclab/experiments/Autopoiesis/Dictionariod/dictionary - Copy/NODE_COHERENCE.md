        Node Coherence (KœÑ): This replaces T_a_node. It measures the stability and integrity of an individual node's resonant pattern. It is the purity of its rhythm.

    The unwavering hum of a single, well-tuned string. It is the steady heartbeat that gives the network its pulse, the pure tone from which all systemic harmony originates.
  law: |
    The total Coherence Flow `J` originating from a node cannot exceed its intrinsic Coherence `KœÑ`. A node with `KœÑ = 0` is a pure sink or passive conduit; it cannot generate productive, resonant flow.
  philosophy: |
    Systemic health begins with the integrity of the component parts. A network of incoherent nodes is merely a collection of noise generators; true resonance and collective action can only emerge from a foundation of stable, coherent individuals.
pirouette_definition: |
  Node Coherence (KœÑ) is a dimensionless scalar quantity measuring the rhythmic purity and temporal stability of an individual node's activity pattern. It quantifies the degree to which a node's signal is a predictable, resonant pattern versus random noise, serving as the ultimate source of all Coherence Flow (`J`) that the node can emit into the network. It replaces the legacy `T_a_node` parameter.

        outline: |
          1. Record the time-series data of the node's primary activity signal (e.g., neural firing rate, packet transmission).
          2. Perform a Fourier Transform on the signal to obtain its power spectrum.
          3. Calculate KœÑ as the ratio of power concentrated in the dominant frequency peak to the total power integrated across the entire spectrum.

        pitfalls: [Insufficient sampling rate leading to aliasing; non-stationary signals requiring windowed analysis.]

      Node Coherence (KœÑ): ... It measures the stability and integrity of an individual node's resonant pattern. It is the purity of its rhythm. Inference: Look for regularity and predictability. In a social network, this is the consistency of a user's activity and role. In a power grid, it is the phase stability of a generator. ... Scaling: `0` (pure noise) to `1` (a perfect, unwavering rhythm).

    excerpt: |
      The flow from node `i` to node `j` is given by: `J_ij = KœÑ_i * cos(œÜ_i - œÜ_j) * (1 - Œì_ij)`. This formula elegantly captures the core dynamics: Source Coherence (`KœÑ_i`): Flow can only originate from a coherent source. A noisy node cannot create a strong, directed current.
  - module: DOMA-158
    excerpt: |
      This entire analysis is a practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). A healthy network is one whose components are successfully navigating the geodesic on their shared coherence manifold, optimizing the Pirouette Lagrangian: `ùìõ_p = KœÑ - f(Œì)`. Coherence (`KœÑ`): The "kinetic" term is the sum of the network's productive, laminar flows.

      justification: |
        The Q factor of an oscillator measures its frequency selectivity and low rate of energy loss. A high-Q resonator has a very sharp power spectrum peak, analogous to a high-KœÑ node whose activity is concentrated in a pure, stable rhythm. The operational measurement via spectral analysis is nearly identical for both.

        KœÑ acts as a local order parameter. It measures the degree to which a node's internal state or activity aligns with a coherent, ordered pattern (KœÑ=1) versus a disordered, high-entropy state (KœÑ=0), much like magnetization measures spin alignment in an Ising model.

# Node Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Node Coherence (KœÑ) is a dimensionless scalar quantity measuring the rhythmic purity and temporal stability of an individual node's activity pattern. It quantifies the degree to which a node's signal is a predictable, resonant pattern versus random noise, serving as the ultimate source of all Coherence Flow (`J`) that the node can emit into the network. It replaces the legacy `T_a_node` parameter.

## EFT-First Summary
Node Coherence is operationally equivalent to the **Quality Factor (Q factor)** of a resonator in physics. Just as a high-Q mechanical or electrical system resonates very cleanly at a specific frequency with minimal energy loss, a high-KœÑ node exhibits a pure, stable rhythm. This "purity" is measured by the sharpness of its peak in the frequency domain. As the primary "kinetic" term in the system's Lagrangian, KœÑ represents the potential for a node to perform coherent work on the network.
