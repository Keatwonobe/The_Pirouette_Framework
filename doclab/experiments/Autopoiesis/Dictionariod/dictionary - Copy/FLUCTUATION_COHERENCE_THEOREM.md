    A system's rhythm is defined by the noise it resists. Coherence is not the absence of chaos, but the ability to hold a tune in the middle of a storm.
  law: |
    The loss of a system's Time-Adherence (1 - Tₐ) is proportional to the integral of the environmental noise power spectrum, weighted by the system's frequency-dependent susceptibility. More noise at frequencies the system is sensitive to causes more decoherence.
  philosophy: |
    This theorem grounds stability as a statistical, environmental relationship, not an intrinsic property. It reframes resilience from a measure of strength against a single force to a measure of signal integrity against a spectrum of noise, establishing a direct, causal link between micro-fluctuations and macro-stability.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem is a core mathematical result proving that the degradation of a system's Time-Adherence (ΔTₐ) is directly proportional to the integrated power spectrum of environmental noise (Sₙ(ω)) filtered by the system's own dynamic susceptibility (|χ(ω)|²). It formalizes the relationship ΔTₐ ∝ ∫ Sₙ(ω) |χ(ω)|² dω, linking the dissipation of coherence to environmental fluctuations.

          5. Independently measure the actual coherence loss 1 - Tₐ from the φ(t) time-series by calculating the ratio of power in the fundamental mode to total power.

    excerpt: |
      The Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. It provides a direct, causal link: the amount of coherence a system "dissipates" (ΔTₐ) is determined by the spectrum of the environmental fluctuations (Sₙ) it experiences, filtered through its own internal sensitivity (χ).
  - module: MATH-008
    excerpt: |
      The Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem gives us a profound diagnostic tool. It proves that stability is a statistical property. To maintain coherence is to be a good filter—to be able to absorb or deflect the environmental noise that exists at frequencies dissonant with one's own... A system does not break because the force against it is too great, but because the noise is too loud.

        The theorem connects a system's dissipative property (loss of coherence, ΔTₐ) to the spectrum of environmental fluctuations (noise spectrum Sₙ), mediated by the system's linear response function (susceptibility χ). This is the exact conceptual and mathematical structure of the FDT in statistical mechanics, which relates dissipation (e.g., friction) to the autocorrelation of thermal forces.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the standard Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) in statistical mechanics. The FDT typically relates thermal fluctuations to a general dissipation coefficient (e.g., friction). The Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem specifically relates environmental fluctuations to the dissipation of *phase coherence* as measured by Time-Adherence, a unique Pirouette concept.

# Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem is a core mathematical result proving that the degradation of a system's Time-Adherence (ΔTₐ) is directly proportional to the integrated power spectrum of environmental noise (Sₙ(ω)) filtered by the system's own dynamic susceptibility (|χ(ω)|²). It formalizes the relationship ΔTₐ ∝ ∫ Sₙ(ω) |χ(ω)|² dω, linking the dissipation of coherence to environmental fluctuations.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of statistical mechanics, the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem is a form of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. It states that the "dissipation" of a system's phase coherence is determined by the spectrum of environmental "fluctuations" (noise), establishing a direct link between the system's response function (susceptibility) and its stability in a noisy environment. This provides a direct, measurable connection between micro-scale noise and macro-scale rhythmic integrity.
