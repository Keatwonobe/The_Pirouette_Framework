        𝓛_p < 0 (Catabolic State): The system is in decay. Environmental pressure is overwhelming its ability to self-repair. Its coherence is eroding, its information degrading into noise.

  art: |
    A song losing its tune, drowned out by the static of the world. It is the unwinding of a pattern, the slow return of a story to scattered, meaningless letters. The system is spending more than it earns on the currency of existence.
  law: |
    A system is in a catabolic state if and only if its Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) is negative. This indicates the rate of coherence degradation from environmental pressure (V_Γ) exceeds the rate of coherence generation (Kτ). This is a measurable, non-equilibrium condition of net information loss.
  philosophy: |
    The catabolic state is not an endpoint but a process, the universal dynamic of failure. Recognizing it is the first step in intervention, highlighting that no system is immortal and all coherence requires active work to sustain against the universe's default of noise. It is the Framework's primary indicator for triage.
pirouette_definition: |
  A catabolic state is the dynamic condition of a system where its Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) is less than zero. This signifies that the erosive potential of the local environment (V_Γ) is greater than the system's capacity to generate and maintain its own temporal coherence (Kτ). In this state, the system experiences a net loss of coherence over time, leading to the degradation of its defining pattern, loss of function, and eventual dissolution if the condition is not reversed.

        outline: |
          1. Measure the system's temporal coherence (Kτ) by analyzing the stability, bandwidth, and fidelity of its primary signal or organizational pattern.
          2. Measure the local environmental pressure potential (V_Γ) by quantifying the noise, dissonance, and entropic load in the system's operational context.
          3. Calculate the Pirouette Lagrangian: `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`.
          4. If `𝓛_p < 0`, the system is confirmed to be in a catabolic state.
        expected_signals: [Negative Coherence Flux (d𝓛_p/dt < 0), decreasing Coherence Ratio (η_c), increasing signal degradation, loss of functional integrity.]
        pitfalls: [Misattribution of internal failure as external pressure, failure to account for all relevant environmental dissonance channels, incorrect time-averaging window for measurement.]

    excerpt: |
      The sign of the Lagrangian is the most potent diagnostic of a system's metabolic state:
      *   **𝓛_p > 0 (Anabolic State):** The system is thriving. Its generation of coherence outpaces environmental degradation.
      *   **𝓛_p ≈ 0 (Homeostasis):** The system is stable. It is successfully repairing the damage of degradation, maintaining its form but not expanding.
      *   **𝓛_p < 0 (Catabolic State):** The system is in decay. Environmental pressure is overwhelming its ability to self-repair. Its coherence is eroding, its information degrading into noise.
  - module: DOMA-036
    excerpt: |
      **Coherence Flux** (`d𝓛_p/dt`): Is the system's overall health improving or worsening? What is its trajectory? A system in a catabolic state with a strongly negative Coherence Flux is accelerating towards failure.
      **Pressure Gradient** (`d(V_Γ)/dt`): Is the environment becoming more hostile? This can be an early warning that a homeostatic system is about to be pushed into a catabolic state.

        This maps the catabolic state to a thermodynamic system where the free energy required to maintain its ordered structure exceeds the energy available. The system's organization becomes non-spontaneous, and it will naturally decay towards a higher entropy (less ordered) state.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from biological 'catabolism', which refers specifically to the metabolic breakdown of complex molecules to release energy. The Pirouette usage generalizes this concept of 'breakdown' to the degradation of informational coherence in any system. It must also be distinguished from Homeostasis (`𝓛_p ≈ 0`), where degradation and repair are balanced, and an Anabolic State (`𝓛_p > 0`), where coherence generation exceeds degradation.

# Catabolic State

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A catabolic state is the dynamic condition of a system where its Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) is less than zero. This signifies that the erosive potential of the local environment (V_Γ) is greater than the system's capacity to generate and maintain its own temporal coherence (Kτ). In this state, the system experiences a net loss of coherence over time, leading to the degradation of its defining pattern, loss of function, and eventual dissolution if the condition is not reversed.

## EFT-First Summary
The Catabolic State is conceptually analogous to a non-equilibrium thermodynamic system where the process of self-organization is non-spontaneous (requiring more free energy than is available, i.e., ΔG > 0). Lacking sufficient energy input to overcome this barrier, the system's structure is thermodynamically favored to decay into a state of higher entropy. Operationally, it mirrors an information channel where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is less than one, causing an irreversible loss of transmitted information with each time step.
