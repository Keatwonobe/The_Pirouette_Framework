    A statistical lens that resolves a diffuse cloud of possibilities into its bright, dense heart of probability. It finds the simple truth hidden within the complex scatter.
  law: |
    A dataset is modeled as a weighted sum of K Gaussian distributions, \(p(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} w_k \mathcal{N}(x|\mu_k, \Sigma_k)\). The parameters \(\{w_k, \mu_k, \Sigma_k\}\) are determined by maximizing the data log-likelihood, typically via the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
  philosophy: |
    To distill emergent structure from complex simulations, replacing a noisy point cloud with a compact, probabilistic description of its central tendency and dispersion. This quantifies otherwise qualitative features, like an "attractor filament," making them amenable to further analysis.

  A probabilistic model used to represent a distribution of points (e.g., high-coherence states from a simulation) as a weighted sum of Gaussian distributions. In the context of the Altruism Filament, a single-component GMM is fitted to the top 5% of Monte-Carlo simulation points in \((\Gamma, T_a)\) space to precisely quantify the filament's central coordinates (\(\mu\)) and its width/orientation via the covariance matrix (\(\Sigma\)).

          1. Run Monte-Carlo simulation (e.g., `cosmic_compass_simulation2.py`) to generate a point cloud in state space \((\Gamma, T_a)\), with an associated Coherence Dividend \(C\) for each point.
          2. Filter the dataset to isolate points with the highest coherence (e.g., top 5% quantile of \(C\)).
          3. Instantiate a `GaussianMixture` object with the desired number of components (typically K=1 for a unimodal filament) and covariance type ('full').
          4. Fit the model to the filtered \((\Gamma, T_a)\) data points.
          5. Extract the `means_` and `covariances_` attributes from the fitted model. These are the filament's center and shape parameters.

        The model used in Pirouette is a direct application of the standard statistical technique of the same name. The implementation cited in XAP-018 uses `sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture`, a canonical software library implementation. Its purpose as a density estimator for simulation data is fully aligned with its conventional use in data science.

    In the Pirouette Framework, GMM exclusively refers to the probabilistic model for density estimation and clustering, as used in machine learning and statistics. It is applied as a post-processing step to analyze simulation data, not as a component of the system's core dynamics.

# Gaussian Mixture Model

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A probabilistic model used to represent a distribution of points (e.g., high-coherence states from a simulation) as a weighted sum of Gaussian distributions. In the context of the Altruism Filament, a single-component GMM is fitted to the top 5% of Monte-Carlo simulation points in \((\Gamma, T_a)\) space to precisely quantify the filament's central coordinates (\(\mu\)) and its width/orientation via the covariance matrix (\(\Sigma\)).

## EFT-First Summary
As a standard tool from statistics, the Gaussian Mixture Model has no direct analogue in effective field theory. It is a data-processing technique used to extract physically meaningful parameters (e.g., the mean and variance characterizing a distribution) from the noisy output of numerical simulations, such as lattice QCD or the Monte Carlo methods employed in Pirouette. Its role is descriptive and inferential, not dynamical.
