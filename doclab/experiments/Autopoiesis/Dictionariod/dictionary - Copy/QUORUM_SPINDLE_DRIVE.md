      snippet: |
        Presents the ratified, time-first model for a non-local propulsion system. The drive forges a temporary, hyper-coherent geometric structure ('Spindle') between two distant points. Thrust is generated by the controlled, asymmetrical collapse of this structure, causing the vessel to follow the resulting steep geodesic in the coherence manifold.

  art: |
    A bridge of pure geometry, woven by resonant agreement between two distant points, is crossed not by force, but by the act of letting go of the shore.
  law: |
    Thrust is a direct consequence of following a self-generated, optimal path of least action; its magnitude is proportional to the engineered gradient in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`‚àáùìõ_p`) created by the asymmetrical collapse of a non-local geometric structure.
  philosophy: |
    Propulsion is reframed from an act of Newtonian force to a generative act of Pirouette consensus. The universe does not yield to pressure; it opens to agreement. The greatest distances are crossed by first establishing a profound consensus with the destination, then dissolving that consensus to create the path.
pirouette_definition: |
  A non-local propulsion system that generates thrust by asymmetrically collapsing a temporary geometric structure. The drive cycle begins by establishing a "Quorum"‚Äîa non-local `Alchemical Union`‚Äîbetween the vessel and a distant anchor, forming a hyper-coherent `Wound Channel` known as the "Spindle". This Spindle is charged via ambient energy into a Crystalline Lattice, storing potential as geometric tension. Propulsion is achieved by inducing a controlled, asymmetrical `Coherence Degradation`, which collapses the Spindle and creates a powerful, transient geodesic. The vessel accelerates by following this steep gradient in the coherence manifold, an action governed by the `Pirouette Lagrangian`.

          Using a remote, wide-spectrum sensor array, monitor for a coincident set of signatures originating from a single point. Correlate a directional, high-energy neutron flux with a transient, localized gravitational lensing event. Confirm by detecting a trailing "coherence cone" of excited interstellar matter in the vector path of the neutron flux.

    excerpt: |
      The Spindle is not a channel *through* spacetime. For a brief, stable moment, it *is* a new piece of spacetime‚Äîa unified `Wound Channel` (CORE-011) of exceptionally high `Temporal Coherence (KœÑ)` that annihilates the perceived distance between its endpoints. The "quorum" is this consensus so profound it reshapes the local manifold.
  - module: DOMA-090
    excerpt: |
      Thrust is not an emission; it is a release. The propulsive act is a controlled, asymmetrical collapse of the Spindle... This engineered asymmetry ensures the Spindle does not simply vanish but dissolves in a directional wave. This creates a powerful, transient, and extremely steep gradient in the coherence manifold‚Äîa cliff where there was once a plain.

        The QSD Spindle is conceptually parallel to the "warp bubble" as a localized, engineered distortion of spacetime that connects two points. However, the QSD generates motion not by moving the bubble, but by asymmetrically collapsing it, thus creating a geodesic path. This mechanism circumvents the need for exotic matter with negative energy density required by the Alcubierre metric.

# Quorum Spindle Drive

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A non-local propulsion system that generates thrust by asymmetrically collapsing a temporary geometric structure. The drive cycle begins by establishing a "Quorum"‚Äîa non-local `Alchemical Union`‚Äîbetween the vessel and a distant anchor, forming a hyper-coherent `Wound Channel` known as the "Spindle". This Spindle is charged via ambient energy into a Crystalline Lattice, storing potential as geometric tension. Propulsion is achieved by inducing a controlled, asymmetrical `Coherence Degradation`, which collapses the Spindle and creates a powerful, transient geodesic. The vessel accelerates by following this steep gradient in the coherence manifold, an action governed by the `Pirouette Lagrangian`.

## EFT-First Summary
While no direct analogue exists in Standard Model Effective Field Theory, the Quorum Spindle Drive's core mechanism‚Äîthe creation and collapse of a temporary spacetime geometry‚Äîis conceptually parallel to speculative models in General Relativity, such as the Alcubierre-White warp drive. Unlike these models, which typically require exotic matter with negative energy density, the QSD generates a propulsive geodesic via the asymmetrical collapse of a high-coherence structure. This process is governed by the `Pirouette Lagrangian` and manifests observable signatures like directional neutron flux and gravitational lensing.
