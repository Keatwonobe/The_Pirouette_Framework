    The cost of bending the local grid of clocks. It is the energetic price for inconsistent phase across the temporal medium, manifesting as the vacuum's familiar resistance to hosting electromagnetic fields.
  law: |
    The coefficient of the kinetic term for the U(1) gauge connection `A_μ`, which must be a positive constant in the effective action. It sets the scale for the energy density of an electromagnetic field, `(1/2)(E^2 + B^2)`, and is inversely proportional to the fine-structure constant `α`.
  philosophy: |
    This parameter grounds electromagnetism not in an axiom, but in the physical properties of the time-first substrate. It transforms the fine-structure constant from a brute fact into a calculable property related to the coherence and elasticity of the temporal medium itself.
pirouette_definition: |
  An effective parameter that quantifies the energy cost associated with the curvature `F_μν` of the Goldstone connection `A_μ`. This cost arises from the underlying temporal medium's resistance to local dephasing (shear), generating the Maxwell kinetic term `-(1/4)F_μνF^μν` in the low-energy Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM) limit. Its magnitude determines the strength of the electromagnetic interaction.

        outline: |
          The stiffness `κ_EM` is the prefactor in `L_EM = -κ_EM (1/4)F^2`. In the canonical QED normalization, `κ_EM` is set to 1, and the coupling strength is defined as the elementary charge `e` in the interaction term `e A_μ J^μ`. Therefore, the stiffness is inversely proportional to the square of the fundamental charge, `κ_EM ∝ 1/e^2`. The fine-structure constant `α = e^2 / (4πħc)` is measured with high precision via experiments like the electron's anomalous magnetic moment or quantum Hall effect, which in turn fixes the stiffness.

        The stiffness is the coefficient of the Maxwell kinetic term. In some QFT normalizations, this coefficient is written explicitly as 1/e² or 1/g², directly relating it to the strength of the gauge coupling. Standard particle physics texts absorb this into the field definition and place the coupling 'e' on the interaction term.

    While named in analogy to stiffness in condensed matter systems (e.g., the energy cost to twist the phase of an order parameter), this is an effective field theory parameter, not the mechanical property of a physical substance. It describes the energy cost for "bending" the gauge connection.

# Electromagnetic Stiffness

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An effective parameter that quantifies the energy cost associated with the curvature `F_μν` of the Goldstone connection `A_μ`. This cost arises from the underlying temporal medium's resistance to local dephasing (shear), generating the Maxwell kinetic term `-(1/4)F_μνF^μν` in the low-energy Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM) limit. Its magnitude determines the strength of the electromagnetic interaction.

## EFT-First Summary
In standard Quantum Electrodynamics, the kinetic term for the photon is written as `-(1/4)F_μνF^μν`. The Electromagnetic Stiffness corresponds to the pre-factor of this term, which is conventionally set to 1 by absorbing the coupling constant `e` into the interaction term `e A_μ J^μ`. Thus, the stiffness is inversely related to the fine-structure constant (`α ∝ 1/κ_EM`), representing the fundamental strength of the electromagnetic interaction. Pirouette treats this stiffness as a physical, emergent property of the temporal medium to be calculated.
