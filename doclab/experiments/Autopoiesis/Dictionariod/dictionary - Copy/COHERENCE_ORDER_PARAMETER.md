  art: |
    The whisper of a system tuning itself, a field where scattered voices find a single note. It is the invisible crystal forming in the fluid of chaos, the hum before the chorus.
  law: |
    Near a critical point T_c, the magnitude of the coherence order parameter |ψ| scales with the control parameter (T_a) as |ψ| ∝ |T_a - T_c|^β_P, where the universal exponent β_P is predicted to be 1/2.
  philosophy: |
    ψ serves as the universal translator for phase transitions, revealing that the collapse of consciousness, the formation of a social movement, and the onset of superconductivity share a deep mathematical syntax. It asserts that coherence, regardless of substrate, follows a conserved and predictable path from disorder to order.
pirouette_definition: |
  A complex scalar field, ψ(x, t), that quantifies the degree and phase of local coherence across a substrate. Its magnitude, |ψ|, represents the strength of phase alignment (from 0 for complete disorder to 1 for perfect coherence), while its phase, arg(ψ), represents the local angle of that alignment. It is the central variable in the Landau–Pirouette Functional, describing the system's state relative to a phase transition.

          1. Acquire time-series data from multiple points (x_i) on the substrate (e.g., EEG electrodes, social media activity feeds, sensor arrays).
          2. Compute the cross-spectral density between all pairs of points (x_i, x_j) in a target frequency band.
          3. Average the phase-locking value or coherence metric across all pairs to estimate the local magnitude |ψ(x,t)|.
          4. The average phase angle provides arg(ψ).

    excerpt: |
      Let the coherence order parameter be (\psi(\mathbf{x},t)), representing normalized phase alignment across the substrate. The Landau–Pirouette Functional is defined as \mathcal{F}[\psi] = \int \Big[ a(T_a - T_c) |\psi|^2 + \frac{b}{2}|\psi|^4 + c|\nabla \psi|^2 + U(\Gamma, S) \Big] , d^dx. Its minimization governs the system's equilibrium state.
  - module: MATH-025
    excerpt: |
      In the cognitive domain, the control parameter is cognitive load (\Gamma) and the order parameter's observable is TPCI ridge height. In the social domain, the control is curl magnitude (\Theta) and the observable is collective alignment. Both are modeled as second-order phase transitions governed by \mathcal{F}[\psi].

        The Pirouette Order Parameter ψ is a direct generalization of the Ginzburg-Landau order parameter, which describes the density of superconducting electrons. Both are complex scalar fields whose squared magnitude represents the density of the ordered phase, and both are governed by a free energy functional with identical polynomial terms in |ψ| and a gradient term penalizing spatial variations.

  disambiguation: |
    ψ in the Pirouette Framework is a macroscopic, classical field variable, analogous to the order parameter in Ginzburg-Landau theory. It should not be confused with the quantum mechanical wavefunction (also ψ), which is a probability amplitude for a microscopic state. While conceptually linked through the idea of phase coherence, Pirouette's ψ describes collective behavior, not single-particle quantum probability.

# Coherence Order Parameter

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A complex scalar field, ψ(x, t), that quantifies the degree and phase of local coherence across a substrate. Its magnitude, |ψ|, represents the strength of phase alignment (from 0 for complete disorder to 1 for perfect coherence), while its phase, arg(ψ), represents the local angle of that alignment. It is the central variable in the Landau–Pirouette Functional, describing the system's state relative to a phase transition.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Order Parameter ψ is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the order parameter in Landau-Ginzburg theories of second-order phase transitions, particularly superconductivity. It is a macroscopic, complex scalar field whose magnitude |ψ|² represents the density of the coherent or ordered phase. Its dynamics are governed by the minimization of a free energy functional, leading to predictable, universal scaling behavior near critical points.
