  art: |
    To place a system under strain is to ask "Who are you?" Its response—whether it bends, yields, or breaks—is the most honest answer it can give.
  law: |
    A system will expend its coherence budget (`Kτ`) to preserve its current `Ki` against environmental coherence costs (`V_Γ`), maintaining this state only as long as it represents the path of maximal coherence (`𝓛_p > 0`).
  philosophy: |
    Identity is not a static property but a dynamic, resonant process. It is the specific pattern of coherence a system actively fights to maintain, revealing its nature most clearly when challenged.
pirouette_definition: |
  Resonant Identity (`Ki`) is the specific, coherent, spatio-temporal pattern that defines a system's state of being. It is the "form" or "song" the system actively maintains by expending its Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) to counteract environmental dissonance (`V_Γ`). A change in `Ki` constitutes a fundamental transformation of the system.
operational_definition:
  units: State-dependent. Typically dimensionless or described by a system's characteristic order parameter(s) (e.g., magnetization, frequency, crystalline structure).

        outline: |
          1. Define the order parameter(s) that characterize the system's `Ki` (e.g., lattice spacing, dominant oscillation frequency, a behavioral pattern).
          2. Apply a controlled, increasing Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) to the system.
          3. Monitor the order parameter(s) for deviation.
          4. `Ki` is the stable pattern observed in the pre-yield (elastic) region. The point of transition to a new stable pattern (plastic yield) or pattern collapse (fracture) marks the boundary of the original `Ki`'s viability.
        expected_signals: [Stable order parameter readings under low stress, critical transition/bifurcation at the yield point]

    excerpt: |
      Plastic Yield (Transformative Flow): The pressure is too great or too sustained for the original form to be recovered. The system is forced to abandon its old `Ki` and discover a new, permanently altered state of resonance that is stable at the higher `Γ`. It finds a new, quieter song.

  disambiguation: |
    `Ki` (Resonant Identity) is distinct from `Kτ` (Temporal Coherence). `Ki` is the *what*—the specific pattern or form being maintained. `Kτ` is the *how much*—the energetic budget available to maintain that form. A crystal's `Ki` is its lattice structure; its `Kτ` is related to its bonding energy.

# Resonant Identity

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Resonant Identity (`Ki`) is the specific, coherent, spatio-temporal pattern that defines a system's state of being. It is the "form" or "song" the system actively maintains by expending its Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) to counteract environmental dissonance (`V_Γ`). A change in `Ki` constitutes a fundamental transformation of the system.

## EFT-First Summary
Within a condensed matter analogy, the Resonant Identity (`Ki`) maps directly to a system's **Order Parameter (ψ)**. Just as an order parameter describes the macroscopic, coherent state of a system within a given phase (e.g., magnetization), `Ki` describes the stable, coherent pattern of a system in a given flow state. The "breaking point" or yield is analogous to a phase transition, where external pressure forces the system to abandon its old order parameter for a new one.
