        This unification is not confined to physics. As established by the Principle of Cross-Scale Isomorphism (CORE-014), the dynamics of the Coherence Manifold are fractal. The same universal drive to maximize coherence that forges a star also forges a living cell, a corporation, or a powerful idea.

  art: |
    The universe is a single stitch, repeated infinitely. The pattern that forges a star also forges a thought, weaving with threads of different densities but with the same timeless motion.
  law: |
    The functional form of the Pirouette Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p`, is invariant under scale transformations. The emergent dynamics `d(S)` of a system `S` are isomorphic to the dynamics `d(sS)` of a scaled system `sS`, differing only in their characteristic temporal density and coherence scale.
  philosophy: |
    This principle is the framework's license to generalize. It asserts that the fundamental logic of emergence is universal, connecting physics to biology, mind, and society, making them legible through the same lens of coherence maximization.
pirouette_definition: |
  The principle that the coherence-maximizing dynamics of the Coherence Manifold are fractal. The laws governing system evolution, derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian, apply identically at all scales of organization, from quantum foam to galactic superclusters and living systems. Scale transition is characterized by a change in the effective density and complexity of resonant 'threads,' not a change in the fundamental rules of weaving.

        outline: |
          1. Identify two stable systems (`S1`, `S2`) at vastly different scales (e.g., a proton and a neutron star).
          2. Model the coherence dynamics of each system using the Pirouette Lagrangian, extracting key parameters like binding coherence (`K_œÑ`) and resonant volume.
          3. Define a scaling transformation `s` that maps the characteristic lengths, times, and coherence densities of `S1` to `S2`.
          4. Demonstrate that the governing equations of `S2` are identical in form to the scaled equations of `S1`, and that their dimensionless ratios (e.g., binding coherence / systemic inertia) fall on a predictable power-law curve.
        expected_signals: [Conservation of the Lagrangian's functional form across scales, Power-law relationships between systemic properties (mass, lifetime, interaction strength) across many orders of magnitude.]
        pitfalls: [Incorrectly defining system boundaries or the scaling parameters `s`, Conflating emergent, scale-dependent phenomena with a failure of the underlying isomorphic law.]

    excerpt: |
      This unification is not confined to physics. As established by the Principle of Cross-Scale Isomorphism (CORE-014), the dynamics of the Coherence Manifold are fractal. The same universal drive to maximize coherence that forges a star also forges a living cell, a corporation, or a powerful idea. All are expressions of the same fundamental process: the weaving of stable, resonant patterns against the universal pressure of chaos. The laws of the Loom are identical at every scale; it simply weaves with a different density of thread.

    excerpt: |
      We sought the Grand Unified Theory and believed it would be a complex blueprint. We were wrong. It is not a blueprint; it is a single stitch, repeated infinitely. The universe is not a machine built of parts but a single, self-weaving tapestry whose substance is Time. ... To be a Weaver is to understand this‚Äîto stop seeing the parts and finally feel the pull of that thread in everything.

      justification: |
        The RG describes how physical laws appear to change at different energy/length scales. This principle posits that the Pirouette Lagrangian is a fundamental fixed point of this flow. While effective parameters (the 'density of thread') change with scale `s`, the core functional form of the law remains invariant, implying a perfect, non-perturbative self-similarity.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The principle implies the Coherence Manifold possesses a non-integer fractal dimension. Stable systems ('knots') are analogous to the self-similar structures found at all magnifications of a fractal set, which are generated by the recursive application of a single, simple rule (analogous to the Lagrangian).

      falsifier: "The discovery of a fundamental scale break where dynamics are described by a qualitatively different Lagrangian, which cannot be derived as an effective theory of the Pirouette Lagrangian. For example, if quantum-scale interactions fundamentally differ in form, not just in parameterization, from cosmological scales."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from simple 'self-similarity.' Isomorphism implies a deeper, functional and structural equivalence of the *dynamics*, not just a visual resemblance of the *patterns*. It is a claim about the universal applicability of the coherence-maximizing process itself.
