        Choose a spatialization map Σ that assigns local charts [x,y,z] to the time substrate so that, in the high-coherence, high-event-density limit, the effective action reduces to the Standard Model Lagrangian on a Lorentzian manifold.

  art: |
    A cartographer's projection, drawing the familiar lands of space upon the unfamiliar ocean of pure Time. Σ is the gauge choice that makes the world we know appear from the world that is.
  law: |
    The Spatialization Map Σ is a function that assigns local spatial coordinates to the time-first substrate such that the effective action S_time reduces to the Standard Model action S_SM in the high-coherence, high-event-density limit. This correspondence must hold for all known Standard Model phenomenology.
  philosophy: |
    Σ codifies the Time-First Correspondence Principle, ensuring that Pirouette recovers the successes of 20th-century physics as an effective, but non-fundamental, description. It is the bridge from Pirouette's ontology to observed phenomenology, preserving experimental results without reifying space.
pirouette_definition: |
  A function, Σ, that maps the time-first substrate (defined by primitives such as Ki, Γ, T_a) to a local spatial chart, typically a 3+1 dimensional Lorentzian manifold with coordinates [x,y,z,t]. The functional form of Σ is constrained by the requirement that it recovers the Standard Model Lagrangian as an effective theory in the high-density, low-fluctuation limit, thereby defining the Standard Model Correspondence Gauge (SM-CG).

        outline: |
          Σ is not directly measured but is calibrated by inversion.
          1. Measure a high-precision Standard Model observable (e.g., fine-structure constant α, electron g-2).
          2. Model the same process using Pirouette CORE primitives in a simulation.
          3. Systematically adjust the functional form of Σ and its parameters until the Σ-projected output of the Pirouette simulation quantitatively matches the experimental measurement to within N standard deviations.
        expected_signals: [Reproduction of SM scattering cross-sections, particle masses, and coupling constants from time-first simulations.]
        pitfalls: [Assuming a unique or overly simple form for Σ; non-convergence of the calibration; circular reasoning if SM-derived results are used to calibrate primitives that underpin Σ (violates CORE-016 §4).]

      Choose a spatialization map Σ that assigns local charts [x,y,z] to the time substrate so that, in the high-coherence, high-event-density limit, the effective action reduces to the Standard Model Lagrangian on a Lorentzian manifold. Formally: there exists Σ such that S_time[Ki, Γ, T_a]  →  S_SM[fields | g_{μν}] as density → ∞ and fluctuations → small.

    excerpt: |
      Standard Model/QFT successes in Pirouette are not coincidental: they are the Σ-shadow of a time-first substrate. Any module that presumes fields on spacetime is canon in SM-CG, and a limit theorem of CORE-020, not ontology.

      justification: |
        Σ acts as a mapping from a "UV" complete theory (Pirouette CORE) to an "IR" effective field theory (the Standard Model). The "high-event-density limit" is analogous to flowing to a low-energy fixed point where the SM fields are the relevant, emergent degrees of freedom. This aligns with the use of "effective action" in the source module.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette prose, Σ is the Spatialization Map. In computational contexts, use `Sigma_map` or a similar explicit name to avoid ambiguity with summation operations. When discussing phenomenology, distinguish from the cross-section symbol by context (e.g., "the cross-section σ is recovered via the map Σ").
