    The Cost Landscape is the rugged terrain of reality, the friction against which coherent form must persist. It is the steepness of the hill that defines the effort of the climb, the resistance that gives interaction its meaning and strength.
  law: |
    The `V_Œì` term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`) quantifies the cost of maintaining coherence against Temporal Pressure. For electromagnetic interactions, its magnitude is scaled by the experimentally-anchored fine-structure constant, `Œ± ‚âà 1/137.036`, making it a direct, measurable proxy for interaction strength.
  philosophy: |
    The Cost Landscape grounds the abstract dynamics of the framework in empirical reality. By linking the "cost" of an interaction to a high-precision physical constant (`Œ±`), it transforms the Lagrangian from a qualitative model into a predictive engine, ensuring the theory's poetry is disciplined by physical measurement.
pirouette_definition: |
  The potential term, `V_Œì`, within the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`), representing the environmental cost of maintaining a system's temporal coherence. The specific functional form of the landscape depends on the interaction, but its overall scale is set by a coupling constant. For electromagnetism, this scale is axiomatically calibrated by the fine-structure constant `Œ±`, making the steepness of the Cost Landscape a direct measure of the interaction's strength.

        outline: |
          The scale of the electromagnetic `V_Œì` is not measured directly but is calibrated by measuring `Œ±`.
          1.  Experimentally measure the electron's anomalous magnetic moment, `a_e = (g_e - 2)/2`, with high precision (e.g., using a Penning trap).
          2.  Invoke the Pirouette axiom `Œ± = 2œÄ * a_e` (from `CORE-009` and `DOMA-101`) to determine the value of `Œ±`.
          3.  This value of `Œ±` becomes the definitive scaling coefficient for any `V_Œì` term describing an electromagnetic interaction.

        `V_Œì` occupies the identical mathematical role as the potential energy term `V` in a classical Lagrangian or the interaction terms in a QFT Lagrangian. It represents the forces and environmental couplings that dictate a system's dynamics, acting in opposition to the kinetic/coherence term. The scaling by `Œ±` is directly analogous to a coupling constant.

  disambiguation: |
    The term "Landscape" evokes concepts like "fitness landscape" in biology. In this context, it is not a space of possibilities to be optimized, but a physical field of potential cost that a system must dynamically navigate in spacetime. "Cost" refers specifically to the action required to sustain coherence against Temporal Pressure.

# Cost Landscape

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The potential term, `V_Œì`, within the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`), representing the environmental cost of maintaining a system's temporal coherence. The specific functional form of the landscape depends on the interaction, but its overall scale is set by a coupling constant. For electromagnetism, this scale is axiomatically calibrated by the fine-structure constant `Œ±`, making the steepness of the Cost Landscape a direct measure of the interaction's strength.

## EFT-First Summary
The Cost Landscape `V_Œì` is the Pirouette Framework's direct analogue to the potential energy term `V` in a classical Lagrangian (`L=T-V`) and the interaction terms (`ùìõ_int`) in a Quantum Field Theory Lagrangian. It represents the non-kinetic terms that govern forces and couplings. The framework specifies that for electromagnetism, the entire `V_Œì` term is scaled by the fine-structure constant `Œ±`, which plays the role of the fundamental coupling constant.
