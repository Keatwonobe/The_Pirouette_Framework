  art: |
    The perfectly woven loom of the temporal medium, ensuring every thread of light travels straight and true, and every falling object follows the same universal curve. It is the substrate's promise of a stable, consistent stage for reality.
  law: |
    Admissible substrate backgrounds must conserve the temporal pressure current, satisfying `∇μ JμΓ = 0`. Any violation would manifest as measurable vacuum dispersion (e.g., non-luminal gravitational waves) or violations of the Equivalence Principle.
  philosophy: |
    The CPM condition is the substrate's self-regulation mechanism, a constitutional law that guarantees the emergence of a stable, consistent spacetime. It ensures the rules of relativity are the same for all particles and forces, preventing the vacuum from degenerating into a chaotic, dispersive medium.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM) is a background configuration of the temporal medium satisfying Substrate Rule 2 (SR-2): `∇μ JμΓ = 0`, where `JμΓ = Γ ∂μΓ` is the temporal pressure current. This conservation law acts as a dynamical selection principle, admitting only those solutions that give rise to a stable, Lorentz-invariant emergent spacetime with a non-dispersive vacuum in the low-energy effective field theory. All phenomena described by General Relativity and the Standard Model are assumed to occur on a CPM.

      - name: Gravitational Wave vs. EM Arrival Time
        outline: |
          Measure the arrival time difference (Δt) between gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals (e.g., gamma-ray bursts) originating from the same distant astrophysical event, like a binary neutron star merger. A non-zero Δt, after accounting for all known astrophysical delays, would constrain any deviation from the CPM condition.
        expected_signals: [Δt consistent with zero, implying `c_gw = c_em`]
        pitfalls: [Poorly modeled plasma dispersion for EM signals, uncertainty in the emission time of GW vs. EM components.]
      - name: Weak Equivalence Principle Test
        outline: |
          Precisely measure the differential acceleration of two test masses of different compositions in a uniform gravitational field (e.g., in orbit). A null result supports the CPM condition.
        expected_signals: [Eötvös parameter η ≈ 0]
        pitfalls: [Systematic errors from stray fields, thermal gradients, or spacecraft mechanics.]

      equation_hint: |
        In the Standard-Model Extension (SME), CPM implies `(k_eff)μνκλ = 0` for gravitons and photons.
      justification: |
        The CPM condition is defined to ensure a non-dispersive vacuum and exact Lorentz invariance in the IR. In the language of EFT, this corresponds to forbidding or setting to zero all Lorentz-violating kinetic operators, particularly those that would make the speed of light or gravity frequency-dependent.

  disambiguation: |
    The CPM is a dynamical condition *on* the Pirouette substrate, not a type of spacetime manifold in the traditional sense of General Relativity. It is the *cause* of a stable, emergent Lorentzian manifold, not the manifold itself.
