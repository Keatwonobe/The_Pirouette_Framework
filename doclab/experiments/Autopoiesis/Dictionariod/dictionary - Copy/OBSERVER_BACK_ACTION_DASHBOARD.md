        3. The Observer Back-Action Dashboard (from MATH-009):
        Input: Data from quantum optics or condensed matter experiments where observation strength (kappa) can be precisely controlled.
        Prediction: The Information-Coherence Inequality I(obs; phi) * Delta T_a >= C predicts a specific, non-linear trade-off curve between the information gained and the coherence lost.
        Falsification: The theory is falsified if experimental data shows that one can gain more information for a given amount of disturbance than the inequality allows.

  art: |
    To see is to disturb. This dashboard is the scale weighing the price of a glance against the sanctity of the dance, charting the scar left by every act of knowing.
  law: |
    An experimental protocol that plots the measured information gain I(obs; φ) against the induced coherence degradation ΔT_a. The results must lie on or above the trade-off curve predicted by the Information-Coherence Inequality I(obs; φ) * ΔT_a ≥ C, falsifying the framework if any data point falls below this limit.
  philosophy: |
    This tool operationalizes the philosophical limit of observation. It transforms the abstract principle that measurement is an interaction into a concrete, falsifiable test, ensuring the framework's claims about information and reality are grounded in measurable consequences.
pirouette_definition: |
  A standardized experimental validation suite and data visualization tool designed to test the Information-Coherence Inequality. It plots information gained versus coherence lost in a system under controlled observation, comparing experimental data points against the theoretical minimum trade-off curve. The dashboard serves as a primary falsification tool for the framework's predictions on measurement back-action.

  units: The dashboard plots information (bits, dimensionless) vs. coherence degradation (seconds, T).

        outline: |
          1. Prepare a coherent quantum system (e.g., a qubit in a superposition state) and measure its baseline coherence lifetime, T_a.
          2. Introduce a weak, continuous observation with a tunable strength, κ (e.g., a probe laser field).
          3. For each value of κ, simultaneously measure two quantities: (a) the information gain I(obs; φ) about the qubit's state, calculated from the probe's output signal, and (b) the new, reduced coherence lifetime T_a', from which ΔT_a = T_a - T_a' is derived.
          4. Plot the resulting (ΔT_a, I(obs; φ)) pairs on the dashboard.
          5. Compare the plotted experimental curve against the theoretical boundary I * ΔT_a = C.
        expected_signals: [A non-linear curve of data points approaching the theoretical boundary from above.]
        pitfalls: [Environmental decoherence masking the measurement back-action, inaccurate calibration of observation strength κ, systematic errors in calculating mutual information from measurement records.]

      justification: |
        This dashboard operationalizes the well-established principle in quantum mechanics that gaining information about a system necessarily disturbs it. The Information-Coherence Inequality proposes a specific, universal functional form for this trade-off, which can be directly tested in weak measurement or quantum non-demolition (QND) experiments. It provides a quantitative law for a previously more qualitative concept.

# Observer Back-Action Dashboard

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A standardized experimental validation suite and data visualization tool designed to test the Information-Coherence Inequality. It plots information gained versus coherence lost in a system under controlled observation, comparing experimental data points against the theoretical minimum trade-off curve. The dashboard serves as a primary falsification tool for the framework's predictions on measurement back-action.

## EFT-First Summary
This dashboard provides an operational test for the fundamental trade-off between information gain and state disturbance, a core concept in quantum measurement theory. By plotting experimental data from weak measurement protocols (e.g., in AMO or condensed matter physics), it directly tests the Pirouette framework's proposed inequality, `I(obs; φ) * ΔT_a ≥ C`, which quantifies measurement back-action. A confirmed violation would falsify a key prediction of the theory.
