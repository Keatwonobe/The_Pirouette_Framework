    A system as a ledger book with three columns‚Äîmatter, energy, and information‚Äîwhere life was the act of keeping the books balanced against the universe's inexorable tax.
  law: |
    A system's health is maintained when the net flux of its three axiomatic currencies‚Äîmaterial, energetic, and informational‚Äîremains non-negative across its boundary. This has been superseded.
  philosophy: |
    TIMF was a crucial, if flawed, step toward a unified biophysics, asserting that information was a physical currency as fundamental as energy or matter. Its failure was not in this premise, but in treating these as separate, interacting ledgers rather than facets of a single, unified dynamic of coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Triaxial Info-Metabolism Framework (TIMF) is the superseded model that described a system's viability as a balance sheet across three distinct, interacting axes: material flux, energetic thermodynamics, and informational coherence. It posited that health was the state of maintaining equilibrium or positive net flow across these three domains simultaneously. TIMF was replaced by the `Ledger of Coherence (DOMA-036)`, which reframes these three axes as manifestations of a single, underlying Lagrangian dynamic between systemic coherence (KœÑ) and environmental pressure (V_Œì).

          4. Assess the three ledgers for balance or deficit, and combine into a composite health score.

        TIMF treated thermodynamic energy/entropy budgets (e.g., Prigogine's dissipative systems) and information-theoretic channel capacity/entropy as separate, parallel accounting systems for a living entity. Its failure lies in not unifying them, a problem addressed by modern stochastic thermodynamics which links work, free energy, and information.

# Triaxial Info-Metabolism Framework

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Triaxial Info-Metabolism Framework (TIMF) is the superseded model that described a system's viability as a balance sheet across three distinct, interacting axes: material flux, energetic thermodynamics, and informational coherence. It posited that health was the state of maintaining equilibrium or positive net flow across these three domains simultaneously. TIMF was replaced by the `Ledger of Coherence (DOMA-036)`, which reframes these three axes as manifestations of a single, underlying Lagrangian dynamic between systemic coherence (KœÑ) and environmental pressure (V_Œì).

## EFT-First Summary
The Triaxial Info-Metabolism Framework was a precursor model analogous to combining classical thermodynamics with Shannon information theory as separate, non-interacting ledgers. It treated a system like a business with three different bank accounts (matter, energy, information) that had to be balanced independently, failing to recognize they were all denominated in a single, underlying currency of physical coherence. This approach was falsified by its inability to predict state changes where the 'accounts' were strongly coupled, and was superseded by the Lagrangian-based `Ledger of Coherence` (`DOMA-036`).
