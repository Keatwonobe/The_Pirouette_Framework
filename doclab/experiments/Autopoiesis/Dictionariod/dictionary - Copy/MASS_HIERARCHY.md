    The universe holds its breath between two curvatures: the Higgs pulling upward into form, the Pressuron pressing downward into time. At their meeting point, the scales of being and becoming cancel, leaving only coherence.
  law: |
    The electroweak vacuum expectation value `v` is not a free parameter but is dynamically set by the coherence barrier frequency `ω_c` via the equilibrium condition `v^2 = (2 ω_c Γ_c) / sqrt(λ_H)`. The hierarchy is a necessary consequence of this resonant lock.
  philosophy: |
    The enormous scale gap is not a problem of 'fine-tuning' requiring explanation, but a feature of 'self-tuning' via resonance saturation. The framework replaces the principle of Naturalness with a principle of Phase Alignment, where stability arises from frequency matching between disparate physical domains.

  The ~17-order-of-magnitude energy difference between the electroweak scale (`v` ≈ 246 GeV) and the Planck scale (`M_P` ≈ 1.22 × 10¹⁹ GeV). In Pirouette, this hierarchy is not a fine-tuning problem but a stable, emergent property of the vacuum. It arises from a **resonant saturation condition** where the energy density of the Higgs potential is balanced by the temporal curvature energy density of the Γ-field at the **coherence barrier** (`ω_c`), dynamically locking the electroweak scale and protecting the Higgs mass from quadratically divergent quantum corrections.

          Using a high-energy lepton collider (e.g., ILC, FCC-ee), measure the di-Higgs production cross-section over a range of center-of-mass energies.

        The Pirouette concept of Mass Hierarchy directly addresses the Standard Model's hierarchy problem, where the Higgs boson's mass receives quadratically divergent quantum corrections up to a UV cutoff scale `Λ_UV`. Pirouette proposes a physical mechanism—the coherence barrier—that replaces the arbitrary cutoff with a finite resonance scale `ω_c`, thus rendering the Higgs mass calculable and stable without fine-tuning.

    In Pirouette, 'Mass Hierarchy' refers specifically to the electroweak-Planck scale gap (the gauge hierarchy problem) unless otherwise specified. It is distinct from the separate problem of why different fermion families have different masses.

# Mass Hierarchy

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The ~17-order-of-magnitude energy difference between the electroweak scale (`v` ≈ 246 GeV) and the Planck scale (`M_P` ≈ 1.22 × 10¹⁹ GeV). In Pirouette, this hierarchy is not a fine-tuning problem but a stable, emergent property of the vacuum. It arises from a **resonant saturation condition** where the energy density of the Higgs potential is balanced by the temporal curvature energy density of the Γ-field at the **coherence barrier** (`ω_c`), dynamically locking the electroweak scale and protecting the Higgs mass from quadratically divergent quantum corrections.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory (EFT), the Mass Hierarchy is known as the **gauge hierarchy problem**: the vast instability of the Higgs mass (`m_H`) against quantum corrections that are quadratically sensitive to the highest energy scale, or UV cutoff (`Λ_UV`), in the theory. Pirouette resolves this by replacing the arbitrary cutoff `Λ_UV` with a physical resonance scale, the **coherence barrier** (`ω_c`), where the Higgs and Γ-fields equilibrate. This renders the electroweak scale a calculable, stable quantity rather than one requiring extreme fine-tuning of initial parameters. (See: Gildener, E. "Gauge-symmetry hierarchies", 1976).
