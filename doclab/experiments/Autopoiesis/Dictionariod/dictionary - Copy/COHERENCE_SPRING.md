  art: |
    An unseen current carrying the system forward, a harmonic resonance discovered by accident. It is the signature of grace emerging from complexity, a system's silent discovery of a better way to be.
  law: |
    A Coherence Spring is formally observed when the time-averaged Coherence Deficit is significantly positive (⟨ΔK_τ⟩ > 0), compelling the refinement of the hypothesized Lagrangian (𝓛̂_model) to account for a previously unmodeled source of coherence or systemic efficiency.
  philosophy: |
    The Coherence Spring challenges the pessimistic bias that models fail only by overestimating a system's capabilities. It reveals that systems can be 'smarter' or more efficient than our understanding allows, transforming model error into a signal of positive unknown unknowns—a direct pointer to opportunities for discovery and optimization.
pirouette_definition: |
  A persistent, positive Coherence Deficit (`ΔK_τ(t) > 0`) where a system's observed Temporal Coherence (`K_τ_obs`) consistently exceeds the coherence predicted by its hypothesized Lagrangian (`K_τ_pred`). This surplus is not noise, but a primary diagnostic signal revealing an unmodeled source of systemic efficiency, a hidden synergy, or a miscalibrated pressure term (i.e., 'semantic dark matter'). The detection of a Coherence Spring compels the Weaver to identify and integrate these overlooked positive dynamics into the system model (`𝓛̂_model`).

    excerpt: |
      A non-zero Coherence Deficit is the "gravitational lensing" of systems analysis. It allows us to detect the presence of invisible masses that bend a system's trajectory. These unmodeled influences, collectively termed **semantic dark matter**, are formally represented by the **Shadow Lagrangian (`𝓛_shadow`)**—the portion of the system's true Lagrangian that is missing from our model.

        In system identification, the residual `e(t)` is the difference between measured output and model prediction. A persistent positive residual indicates the model systematically underestimates the system's output, analogous to a Coherence Spring where the model (`𝓛̂_model`) underestimates the system's achieved coherence.

    Distinguish from a simple windfall or stochastic gain. A Coherence Spring is a *systemic* and *persistent* positive deficit that indicates a structural feature of the system or its environment, not a one-off lucky event. It reflects an error in the model's understanding of the system's intrinsic capabilities.

# Coherence Spring

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Coherence Spring is a persistent, positive Coherence Deficit (`ΔK_τ > 0`), which measures a system achieving more Temporal Coherence than a predictive model accounted for. It serves as a crucial diagnostic signal, indicating that the model is missing an important source of efficiency, a hidden synergy, or an unaccounted-for resource. Its discovery triggers an investigation to find this "semantic dark matter" and integrate it, making the model more accurate.

## EFT-First Summary
In system analysis, a Coherence Spring is analogous to a persistent positive residual, where a system's measured performance consistently exceeds a predictive model's output. This signals that the model is incomplete and fails to account for a source of efficiency, a beneficial interaction, or a synergy. Its detection triggers a search for these 'positive unknown unknowns' to improve the model's fidelity and reveal opportunities for optimization.
