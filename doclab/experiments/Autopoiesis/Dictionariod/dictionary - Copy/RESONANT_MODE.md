        The Pirouette Framework redefines the microstate. A microstate is not a configuration in physical space, but a resonant mode in the coherence manifold. Omega is therefore the total number of resonant modes available to a system and its environment.

  art: |
    Each possible way a system can hum its tune; the individual notes that, when combined, form the chorus of what is, and the silence of what could be.
  law: |
    The total number of accessible resonant modes (Ω) for a combined system and environment determines its entropy (S = k_B * ln(Ω)) and dictates the direction of spontaneous change towards the macroscopic state with the highest Ω.
  philosophy: |
    By shifting the fundamental state from a particle's position to a system's mode of vibration, the Resonant Mode grounds existence not in *what* a thing is, but in *how* it persists and interacts. It makes dynamics, not statics, the primary reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Resonant Mode is the fundamental, indivisible unit of a system's state within the Pirouette Framework, representing a specific, quantized pattern of coherence. It replaces the classical concept of a microstate (a configuration of particles in phase space). The total number of accessible Resonant Modes (Ω) for a system at a given energy determines its entropy and its interaction with ambient Temporal Pressure.

      - name: Coherence Spectroscopy
        outline: |
          A system is probed with a broad-spectrum coherent field. The system's response function is measured, revealing absorption or emission peaks corresponding to its allowed resonant modes. The total number of modes (Ω) within a given energy band is inferred by integrating the mode density over that band.

        pitfalls: [Mode broadening due to environmental decoherence, Overlapping modes in complex systems, Inaccessible 'dark' modes that do not couple to the probe field]

    excerpt: |
      The Pirouette Framework redefines the microstate. A microstate is not a configuration in physical space, but a resonant mode in the coherence manifold. A Low-Entropy System has its resonance confined to a very small number of specific, ordered modes, while a High-Entropy Environment has its energy distributed across a vast number of chaotic, disordered resonant modes.
  - module: DOMA-116
    excerpt: |
      Stability is not a static property but a dynamic one, a system's ability to maintain its primary resonant mode against the decohering influence of its environment. When a system 'breaks,' it is because the energetic cost of maintaining its specific, low-entropy mode exceeds its coherence budget, forcing it to collapse into a more probable, higher-entropy set of modes.

        S = k_B * ln(Ω_pirouette)
      justification: |
        The Resonant Mode is the direct Pirouette replacement for the classical microstate. Instead of counting particle configurations in phase space, Pirouette counts the available modes of coherent vibration. This re-frames entropy as a measure of modal, rather than spatial, possibility.

    - statement: "The entropy of a system can be calculated by counting its discrete resonant modes, and this calculation will match the thermodynamically measured entropy (S = ∫ dQ_rev / T)."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "An experimental system (e.g., a perfect crystal at low T) is found where the number of spectroscopically measured modes (Ω) yields an entropy S = k_B * ln(Ω) that is inconsistent with the entropy measured via calorimetry. This would indicate that resonant modes are not the complete basis for entropy."

  disambiguation: |
    While similar to a 'normal mode' in mechanics or an 'eigenstate' in QM, a Resonant Mode is more fundamental. It is not a property *of* a system of particles, but the foundational element *comprising* the system's state. It is the primitive 'atom' of a system's existence in the coherence manifold.
