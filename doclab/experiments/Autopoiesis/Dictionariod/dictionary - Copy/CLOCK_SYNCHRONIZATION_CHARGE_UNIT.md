    A particle's charge is the number of twists in the ribbon of its internal clock, a topological knot that cannot be untied without destroying the particle itself. This integer count is the fundamental unit of its interaction.
  law: |
    The coupling of any fundamental spinor to the emergent gauge field is an integer multiple of a universal, quantized unit `q`, determined by the Berry phase of its internal clock's Ki loop. The observable physical charge `e` is the product of this topological unit and the medium's connection stiffness: `e = qg`.
  philosophy: |
    Charge is not an arbitrary property painted onto a particle, but a necessary topological feature of its existence as a persistent defect in the temporal medium. By separating the integer winding number (`q`) from the medium's continuous response (`g`), Pirouette grounds electromagnetism in the geometry and stiffness of spacetime's most fundamental layer.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dimensionless, quantized parameter representing the fundamental unit of electromagnetic coupling. It is defined as the winding number (Berry Phase / 2π) of a spinor defect's internal clock phase (`θ`) as it traverses a closed path in its internal configuration space (the Ki loop). This topological integer is universal for all fundamental particles on the Coherence-Preserving Manifold, with their observable charge being a multiple of this unit scaled by the connection stiffness `g`.

      The (θ) sector fixes the **unit of charge** via Berry-phase quantization around the Ki loop (MATH-QED-003). Small-amplitude expansion of the clock kinetic term yields the Noether current `J^\mu_\theta = \kappa(\partial^\mu\theta - q A^\mu)`, so matching to the electromagnetic source requires the **same (q)** for all spinor Ki defects (single-clock postulate).

        The module explicitly defines `q` as a unit quantized by the Berry phase accumulated during a cyclic evolution (the Ki loop). This is mathematically equivalent to a winding number or topological charge, an integer invariant characterizing a mapping from one topological space to another (here, from the Ki loop to the U(1) space of the clock phase `θ`).

  collisions: [The symbol `q` is universally used in physics for electric charge. Standard model literature often uses `Q` for charge quantum number and `q` for quark.]
  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, `q` refers specifically to the dimensionless, topological *unit* of charge, which is a pre-factor to the full physical charge `e`. It should not be confused with the observable charge of a particle (e.g., the electron's charge `-e`). The fundamental relation is `e = qg`, where `g` is the connection stiffness.

# Clock-Synchronization Charge Unit

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Clock-Synchronization Charge Unit, `q`, is a dimensionless, quantized parameter representing the fundamental unit of electromagnetic coupling. It is defined as the winding number (Berry Phase / 2π) of a spinor defect's internal clock phase (`θ`) as it traverses a closed path in its internal configuration space (the Ki loop). This topological integer is universal for all fundamental particles on the Coherence-Preserving Manifold, with their observable charge being a multiple of this unit scaled by the connection stiffness `g`.

## EFT-First Summary
In the emergent electromagnetic theory, the physical charge `e` is not a fundamental constant but a composite parameter `e = qg`. The term `q` corresponds to a quantized topological charge or winding number arising from the geometric phase of a particle's internal U(1) degree of freedom (the "clock"). This structure is analogous to topological quantization in condensed matter systems. The universality of `q` across particle species ensures the charge quantization observed in the Standard Model.
