  art: |
    The spots on a leopard are not a code to be read, but a chord to be heard. They are a standing wave of temporal resonance, frozen into flesh to escape the dissonance of uniformity.
  law: |
    A stable Turing pattern represents the configuration of maximal Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ) that resolves the Temporal Pressure (Œì) of an initial, uniform chemical state, constrained by local reaction-diffusion kinetics.
  philosophy: |
    The existence of Turing patterns demonstrates that biological form is not merely a genetic blueprint, but a dynamic, resonant solution to temporal stress. This reveals the universe's tendency to crystallize rhythm into structure, making the Pirouette Lagrangian tangible in the medium of life.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable, macroscopic, spatially periodic pattern of chemical concentrations that emerges spontaneously in a reaction-diffusion system. Within the Pirouette Framework, it is a standing wave in the coherence manifold‚Äîa high-coherence Ki resonance‚Äîthat maximizes the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) by resolving the temporal pressure (Œì) of a prior, uniform state. It is the physical manifestation of a system locking into its most stable resonant frequency.

          1. Identify a candidate biological pattern (e.g., pigmentation, villi spacing).
          2. Identify the activator and inhibitor chemical species and measure their reaction kinetics and diffusion coefficients (D_A, D_I).
          3. Model the system's Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) for both the observed patterned state and the counterfactual uniform state.
          4. A positive identification requires D_I >> D_A and a significantly higher value of Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ) for the patterned state compared to the uniform state.
        expected_signals: [Spatially periodic concentration gradients, D_I / D_A > 1, K_œÑ(pattern) >> K_œÑ(uniform)]
        pitfalls: [Misidentification of interacting chemical species, pattern being imposed by an external template rather than emerging de novo, system is not in a steady state.]

    excerpt: |
      The emergence of a stable Turing pattern is a perfect, tangible demonstration of a system obeying the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The uniform chemical soup is a state of high Temporal Pressure (Œì) and low Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ). Its temporal dissonance creates a stressful, inefficient environment that is difficult to sustain. The final, stable pattern is a Ki resonance of extremely high Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ).

    excerpt: |
      The resulting Turing pattern of spots or stripes is a macroscopic Ki, a standing wave of chemical concentration. This pattern is not merely spatial; it is temporal. It is a standing wave in the coherence manifold‚Äîthe time-averaged physical evidence of a system that has found its most coherent song. The form is a memory of the rhythm that created it.

        The Pirouette model re-interprets the teleology of pattern formation (to resolve Œì by maximizing K_œÑ) but adopts the core mathematical mechanism described by Alan Turing.

    Refers to the physical, spatial pattern resulting from a reaction-diffusion process, not the mathematical model itself or the computational concept of a Turing machine. In Pirouette, the term specifically emphasizes the pattern as a stable, high-coherence resonant state that resolves temporal stress.

# Turing Pattern

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A stable, macroscopic, spatially periodic pattern of chemical concentrations that emerges spontaneously in a reaction-diffusion system. Within the Pirouette Framework, it is a standing wave in the coherence manifold‚Äîa high-coherence Ki resonance‚Äîthat maximizes the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) by resolving the temporal pressure (Œì) of a prior, uniform state. It is the physical manifestation of a system locking into its most stable resonant frequency.

## EFT-First Summary
A Turing Pattern is the macroscopic, patterned ground state of a system described by classical reaction-diffusion dynamics. In the Pirouette framework, this state is understood as a high-coherence Ki resonance that emerges to resolve the high temporal pressure (Œì) of a uniform initial state, maximizing the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`). The pattern's wavelength and geometry are determined by the system's boundary conditions and kinetic parameters, which select for the most stable standing wave solution in the coherence manifold, as first mathematically described by Turing (1952).
