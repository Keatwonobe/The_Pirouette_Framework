        **Whirlpools of Dissonance:** These are pathological features of the manifold‚Äîstable attractors of low coherence. They represent the cycles of recidivism, where the geometry of the system and the inertia of an individual's **Wound Channel** (past trauma, criminal record, habits) make it easier to fall back into a turbulent state than to find a stable one.

  art: |
    A self-feeding vortex in the landscape of a life, where the current of past mistakes pulls one back under, making the struggle for air harder with each cycle.
  law: |
    A Whirlpool of Dissonance is a region on a coherence manifold where the gradient of temporal pressure (‚àáŒì) consistently directs trajectories towards a local minimum of temporal coherence (KœÑ), and from which the coherence expenditure required for escape (ŒîKœÑ_escape) is greater than the ambient KœÑ of the surrounding region.
  philosophy: |
    This concept re-frames systemic failure not as a series of isolated bad choices, but as a predictable topological feature of an unjust landscape. It shifts moral responsibility from the individual trapped within the whirlpool to the architects of the system that created it.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable, low-coherence attractor state on a coherence manifold, characterized by a self-reinforcing feedback loop of high temporal pressure (Œì) and low temporal coherence (KœÑ). Whirlpools are pathological topological features that trap system-actors in non-productive, high-energy cycles, often driven by the inertia of a Wound Channel.
operational_definition:
  units: State classifier (dimensionless) or a region defined by a potential well with units of Coherence (KœÑ).
  symbol_table:
    - name: üåÄ
      meaning: A specific Whirlpool of Dissonance; a topological feature.
      dimensions: Dimensionless (State Classifier)
      default_range: N/A (binary: present/absent)
    - name: KœÑ_min
      meaning: The minimum value of temporal coherence at the center of the attractor.
      dimensions: Coherence
      default_range: KœÑ < KœÑ_ambient
    - name: ŒîKœÑ_escape
      meaning: The "escape velocity" in units of coherence; the KœÑ expenditure required to exit the whirlpool's basin of attraction.

    procedures:
      - name: Recidivism Trajectory Analysis
        outline: |
          1. Longitudinally track a cohort moving through a system (e.g., criminal justice), sampling KœÑ proxies (e.g., employment stability, housing security, pro-social network strength) and Œì proxies (e.g., arrests, parole violations, court appearances).
          2. Plot individual trajectories in a KœÑ vs. Œì phase space.
          3. Identify dense clusters of looping, low-KœÑ trajectories, indicating a stable attractor.
          4. Measure the mean ŒîKœÑ required for trajectories to successfully exit the cluster versus the mean KœÑ of those that remain. A high positive value confirms a whirlpool.
        expected_signals: [High recidivism rates (>60% over 3 years), strong negative correlation between time-in-system and post-release KœÑ indicators, a "tipping point" KœÑ level below which return to the cycle is >90% probable.]
        pitfalls: [Confounding variables (pre-existing trauma vs. system-induced trauma), poor proxy data for KœÑ and Œì, mistaking transient turbulence for a stable attractor.]

    excerpt: |
      **Whirlpools of Dissonance:** These are pathological features of the manifold‚Äîstable attractors of low coherence. They represent the cycles of recidivism, where the geometry of the system and the inertia of an individual's **Wound Channel** (past trauma, criminal record, habits) make it easier to fall back into a turbulent state than to find a stable one. An individual's path through this landscape is not random; they are always seeking the "downhill" path toward what feels like the most stable state available to them.
  - module: DOMA-122
    excerpt: |
      This is the pathology of chaotic, self-perpetuating harm where the system's actions generate more instability than they resolve. The system is fighting itself. Its processes are adversarial and destructive, wasting immense energy in friction and creating the "whirlpools of dissonance." Manifestations: The cycle of recidivism, where prisons act as "schools of crime"; adversarial courtrooms that obscure truth; punitive parole policies that create a cycle of technical violations.

      domain: Math
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Whirlpools describe a bounded, stable region in the system's phase space to which trajectories are drawn, but which is not a static equilibrium. This maps conceptually to a limit cycle (for periodic recidivism) or a strange attractor (for chaotic, but bounded, recidivism).

  adopted:
    - target: Potential Well
      rationale: |
        The Lagrangian formulation (ùìõ = KœÑ - VŒì) in DOMA-122 explicitly frames system dynamics in terms of kinetic (KœÑ) and potential (VŒì) energies. A Whirlpool functions as a local minimum in the system's potential landscape that traps actors, making the 'potential well' a direct and powerful mathematical analogy for its stability and the 'escape velocity' (ŒîKœÑ) required to exit it.
      confidence: 0.8
constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Interventions designed to 'flatten' a specific Whirlpool (e.g., by reducing Œì through policy changes like decriminalizing technical parole violations) will result in a statistically significant decrease in the recidivism rate for the population affected by that Whirlpool."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "The recidivism rate remains unchanged or increases, suggesting the attractor is not caused by the targeted pressure (Œì), or that other, stronger pressures (like the Wound Channel's inertia) dominate the dynamics."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'Coherence Atrophy' (Stagnant Flow), which is a blockage preventing movement entirely. A Whirlpool is a state of active, cyclical, and dissonant movement. One is a dam; the other is a chaotic eddy.
