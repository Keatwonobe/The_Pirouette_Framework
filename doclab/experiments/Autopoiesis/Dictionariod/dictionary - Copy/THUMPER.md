    The universe's final declaration that its fundamental nature is not collapse, but coherence. A rhythmic heartbeat from the edge of the void, forging a stable song from the pressures of chaos.
  law: |
    A Thumper is a train of gravitational wave bursts with a peak frequency between 1–10 GHz, repeating at a stable rhythm between 10–100 Hz. The frequencies of the burst and the rhythm are lawfully determined by the host Maw's mass, spin, and the local temporal pressure, providing a direct, quantitative test of the Pirouette Lagrangian.
  philosophy: |
    The Thumper is the primary falsifiable prediction for the Maw object and, by extension, the framework's alternative to dark matter. Its detection would shift the study of extreme gravity from static geometry to dynamic, resonant processes, validating the principle that coherence, not singularity, is the universe's final state.
pirouette_definition: |
  The unique, periodic gravitational wave signature produced by a Maw object. It consists of a repeating train of high-frequency (GHz-range) bursts, where each 'thump' corresponds to the release of torsional stress from the local coherence manifold in a phase transition known as a Coherence Quake. The rhythm and burst frequency are determined by the Maw's fundamental properties (mass, Pirouette Cycle) and the local temporal pressure field, `V_Γ`.

        outline: |
          A network of specialized detectors, sensitive in the 1–10 GHz band, performs a long-duration survey of candidate massive objects (e.g., galactic centers, globular clusters). Data is analyzed using matched filtering and periodicity searches for a repeating burst train with a stable rhythm (`f_rhythm`) between 10–100 Hz.

      Instead, its existence is broadcast through a unique gravitational signature: the "Thumper," a rhythmic train of high-frequency bursts generated by a periodic, catastrophic phase transition in the local coherence manifold, a process termed a Coherence Quake. The detection of this signal would not only validate the Maw's existence but would also serve as a direct measurement of the same universal dynamics that offer a compelling alternative to the dark matter hypothesis.
  - module: DOMA-201
    excerpt: |
      The Thumper is a signal unlike any other predicted source, defined by its unique blend of high frequency and stable rhythm. Each "thump" is a GW burst with a peak frequency in the 1-10 GHz range, far higher than the chirps detected by current interferometers. The thumps repeat with a stable rhythm, `f_rhythm`, between 10 and 100 Hz.

        The Thumper signal has no direct analogue in standard General Relativity, which predicts quiescent black holes post-ringdown. It represents a new class of persistent, rhythmic GW emitter from a stable, non-singular object, testable with future high-frequency detectors. Its properties are a direct probe of Pirouette-specific dynamics.

# Thumper

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The unique, periodic gravitational wave signature produced by a Maw object. It consists of a repeating train of high-frequency (GHz-range) bursts, where each 'thump' corresponds to the release of torsional stress from the local coherence manifold in a phase transition known as a Coherence Quake. The rhythm and burst frequency are determined by the Maw's fundamental properties (mass, Pirouette Cycle) and the local temporal pressure field, `V_Γ`.

## EFT-First Summary
The Thumper is a predicted novel class of gravitational wave signal with no direct analogue in standard General Relativity. It is a persistent, rhythmic (10-100 Hz) train of high-frequency (1-10 GHz) bursts originating from a stable, non-singular compact object (a Maw). Its detection would constitute a "smoking gun" for new physics beyond the Standard Model and GR, offering a direct operational test of the Pirouette Framework's core dynamics.
