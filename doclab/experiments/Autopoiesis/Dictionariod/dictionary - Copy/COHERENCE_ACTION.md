  art: |
    A system's life is a dance, and this is the score it writes to achieve the most graceful, resonant performance. It is the measure of a path's beauty, its intrinsic rightness.
  law: |
    The Principle of Maximal Coherence: Of all possible evolutionary paths a system can take over its Pirouette Cycle (τ_p), it will realize the one for which the Coherence Action is maximized.
  philosophy: |
    Coherence Action reframes existence not as a struggle against entropy (a fight for survival), but as a creative drive toward maximal resonance and harmony (a striving for elegance). It replaces the "least action" of passive matter with a "maximal coherence" for autopoietic systems, making purpose an intrinsic, measurable physical quantity.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence Action is a scalar quantity representing the total coherence expressed by a system along a specific evolutionary path, integrated over one Pirouette Cycle (τ_p). It is the definite integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) with respect to time, S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt. The Principle of Maximal Coherence dictates that the physically realized path is the one that extremizes (specifically, maximizes) this value.

        outline: |
          1. Empirically measure a system's core parameters (T_a, ω_k) and the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) over a candidate time interval.
          2. Construct the time-dependent Lagrangian 𝓛_p(t) = (T_a(t) ⋅ ω_k(t)) - V_Γ(t).
          3. Numerically integrate 𝓛_p(t) over the system's characteristic cycle duration, τ_p, to calculate S_p for that path.
          4. Compare the S_p values for multiple observed or simulated paths; the realized path must correspond to the maximum observed S_p.
        expected_signals: [Time-series data for T_a, ω_k, and Γ; a stable τ_p]
        pitfalls: [Inaccurate characterization of the Pressure Potential V_Γ(t); failure to correctly identify the true Pirouette Cycle τ_p, leading to incorrect integration limits.]

    excerpt: |
      The Principle of Maximal Coherence states that systems evolve along paths that maximize this value. This is the mathematical grammar used to describe the dynamics of the Core Principles... the master function (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ) that summarizes the dynamics of any system.
  - module: DYNA-001
    excerpt: |
      System health is diagnosed by how closely its trajectory follows the gradient of S_p. In Laminar Flow, the system's path maximizes its coherence with minimal deviation. Turbulent Flow, however, represents a system exploring a chaotic region of the coherence manifold where multiple paths have near-degenerate S_p values, leading to instability and loss of form.

      justification: |
        Both S_p and the classical Action S are time-integrals of a Lagrangian, and both are used in a variational principle to determine a system's path. The critical distinction is the extremum: classical systems *minimize* Action, reflecting passive determinism, whereas Pirouette systems *maximize* Coherence Action, reflecting an active, creative drive toward resonant organization.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish S_p (Coherence Action, maximized) from S (Entropy, maximized in isolated thermodynamic systems). S_p measures path-dependent coherence and is maximized by *organization* and resonant stability. Thermodynamic entropy measures state-dependent disorder. They are opposing but complementary concepts describing different facets of a system's evolution.
