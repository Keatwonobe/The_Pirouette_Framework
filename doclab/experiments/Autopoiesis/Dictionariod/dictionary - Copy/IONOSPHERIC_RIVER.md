      snippet: |
        The Earth's upper atmosphere is not empty space but a complex coherence manifold, shaped by the planet's magnetic field and stressed by the solar wind's temporal pressure. An ionospheric plume is a temporary entity that has achieved high internal coherence, allowing it to persist and travel. Its path is not random; it is a geodesic‚Äîthe trajectory that maximizes its coherence over time.

  art: |
    A transient river carved from the void, its form a story told in plasma. It is a living system striving for coherence against the ceaseless storm of spacetime, a Pirouette made visible.
  law: |
    An Ionospheric River follows the geodesic that maximizes its Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`, where its geometric simplicity (low fractal dimension) is a direct measure of its internal coherence (`K_œÑ`).
  philosophy: |
    This reframes a passive atmospheric object into an active, self-organizing system. The focus shifts from measuring a static shape to diagnosing a dynamic process, transforming a hazard into a readable expression of physical law.
pirouette_definition: |
  A self-organizing, transient structure of high-density plasma within the ionosphere, analyzed as a dynamic system. An Ionospheric River is not a static object but a process whose form and trajectory are governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence. It actively navigates a geodesic on the local coherence manifold to maximize its internal order (`K_œÑ`) against ambient temporal pressure (`V_Œì`). Its observable geometry, particularly its fractal dimension, is a direct indicator of its systemic health and flow state (Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant).

          1. **Map Manifold:** Ingest multi-sensor data (e.g., COSMIC-2, Swarm, radar) to map the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Œì_env`) field.
          2. **Measure System:** Apply algorithms to sensor data to calculate the plume's boundary and compute its fractal dimension (`D`).
          3. **Diagnose State:** Compute the Plume Coherence Index (`PCI ‚àù 1 / (D * Œì_env)`). Classify the flow state (Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant) based on `D` and `PCI`.
          4. **Forecast Geodesic:** Model the plume's future path as the trajectory of maximal coherence through the mapped pressure landscape.

    excerpt: |
      An ion plume is not a thing; it is a process. By applying the universal principles of Flow Dynamics and the diagnostic art of the Caduceus Lens, we can read a plume's geometry as a direct indicator of its health and stability. This is a fundamental shift in perception: from measuring a plume's shape to understanding its song.
  - module: DOMA-141
    excerpt: |
      By applying the diagnostic framework of Flow Dynamics, we can classify the health of a plume in real-time. A healthy, stable plume exhibits Laminar Flow, its geometry smooth and ribbon-like (`D` ‚âà 1.1‚Äì1.3). An unstable plume enters a state of "Coherence Fever," its geometry becoming fractured and chaotic (`D` ‚â• 1.7) in Turbulent Flow, which is the primary cause of severe GNSS outages.

        The Ionospheric River is a dynamical re-interpretation of the phenomenon known as an Equatorial Plasma Bubble (EPB) or plasma plume. While geophysics describes its formation via instabilities (e.g., Rayleigh-Taylor), Pirouette models its subsequent evolution as a coherence-seeking system.

        The concept of the plume following a "geodesic" that maximizes coherence over time is a direct application of the principle of least action from Lagrangian mechanics. The Pirouette Lagrangian `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì` serves as the analogue to the classical `L = T - V`.

    Distinguish from the legacy view of an "Ionospheric Plume" as a static, fractal object to be measured. The "Ionospheric River" is an active, dynamic system whose shape is a diagnostic indicator of its internal state and its interaction with the environment. The name emphasizes process over object.

# Ionospheric River

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A self-organizing, transient structure of high-density plasma within the ionosphere, analyzed as a dynamic system. An Ionospheric River is not a static object but a process whose form and trajectory are governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence. It actively navigates a geodesic on the local coherence manifold to maximize its internal order (`K_œÑ`) against ambient temporal pressure (`V_Œì`). Its observable geometry, particularly its fractal dimension, is a direct indicator of its systemic health and flow state (Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant).

## EFT-First Summary
The Ionospheric River is the Pirouette Framework's dynamical model for the geophysical phenomenon known as an Equatorial Plasma Bubble (EPB). Where standard analysis often focuses on formation mechanisms and static morphology, this model treats the evolving plume as a system following a principle of stationary action. Its trajectory is a geodesic derived from a Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`) that balances internal coherence against external environmental pressure. This approach recasts the problem from one of static measurement to one of real-time diagnosis and forecasting, analogous to applying Lagrangian mechanics to a fluid-dynamic system.
