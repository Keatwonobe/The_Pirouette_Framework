        Reinforcement: When an entity repeats a behavior, it traverses the same region of its coherence manifold. Each pass deepens and clarifies the Wound Channel, like a river carving its bed. The path of maximal coherence becomes a path of least resistance. This is the mechanism of habit, learning, and the strengthening of memory.

  art: |
    A path walked once is a suggestion; walked a thousand times, it becomes a canyon. Repetition transforms a faint trail in spacetime into a foregone conclusion.
  law: |
    The local coherence gradient of a Wound Channel increases proportionally to the frequency and fidelity of its traversal. This creates a positive feedback loop, lowering the activation energy for subsequent traversals along the same path.
  philosophy: |
    Reinforcement is the physical mechanism by which history gains inertia. It explains how patterns, from habits to memories to cultural norms, persist and strengthen, making the universe a place where the past actively shapes the present.
pirouette_definition: |
  Reinforcement is the process by which a Wound Channel's geometric definition is amplified through repeated traversal by an entity exhibiting a consistent Ki pattern. Each pass deepens the channel's impression on the local coherence manifold, reducing the coherence cost for subsequent traversals and establishing a path of least resistance. This mechanism is the physical basis for inertia of state, memory formation, habit, and the entrenchment of dynamic patterns across all scales.

        outline: |
          Generate a stable entity (e.g., a coherent particle state) and guide it through a specific path in a controlled coherence manifold N times. After the Nth traversal, probe the region with a secondary, non-interfering resonance. Measure the fidelity and amplitude of the echo propagating from the now-reinforced Wound Channel. Compare the echo's clarity for N=1 versus N >> 1.

        In LTP, repeated synchronous firing of pre- and post-synaptic neurons strengthens their connection. This is a direct biological analog to Reinforcement, where repeated traversal of a coherence path (neural activity) deepens a Wound Channel (synaptic connection), making future traversal (firing) more probable.

        The process of repeatedly traversing a channel and clarifying it is analogous to an RG flow. The repeated action (integrating out high-energy modes) drives the system's parameters (the channel's geometry) towards a stable configuration (a fixed point), which represents the path of least resistance.

# Reinforcement

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Reinforcement is the process by which a Wound Channel's geometric definition is amplified through repeated traversal by an entity exhibiting a consistent Ki pattern. Each pass deepens the channel's impression on the local coherence manifold, reducing the coherence cost for subsequent traversals and establishing a path of least resistance. This mechanism is the physical basis for inertia of state, memory formation, habit, and the entrenchment of dynamic patterns across all scales.

## EFT-First Summary
Reinforcement conceptually maps to Hebbian learning and Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) in neuroscience, where repeated activation strengthens synaptic pathways. A system's repeated traversal of a state-space path reduces the effective "potential barrier" for future traversals, analogous to how repeated neural firing strengthens a connection. Mathematically, it resembles a Renormalization Group (RG) flow, where repeated operations drive a system toward a stable fixed point, or "path of least resistance."
