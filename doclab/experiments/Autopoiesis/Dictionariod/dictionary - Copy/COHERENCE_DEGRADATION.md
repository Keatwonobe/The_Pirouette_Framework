        Every contest is audited by entropy. The Resonant Test is an information-rich but entropically expensive process. It accelerates Coherence Degradation (CORE-013) by forcing both systems into a state of high stress, expending immense energy simply to maintain form.

    A song straining to hold its melody against a rising tide of static. The fraying edge of a pattern burning too brightly under scrutiny. The inevitable price of existence paid in the currency of information.
  law: |
    The rate of a system's informational decay (δ_c) is proportional to the temporal pressure (Γ) it experiences, increasing non-linearly during a Resonant Test as a function of the shared adversarial potential V_Γ. A system fractures when its rate of degradation exceeds its capacity to maintain its resonant pattern (K_τ).
  philosophy: |
    Existence is not free; every moment a pattern persists, it pays an entropic tax. Coherence Degradation is this fundamental accounting, the universal arbiter that ensures form is a temporary, hard-won victory against chaos. Conflict, by raising the stakes, simply accelerates the final audit.
pirouette_definition: |
  The lawful, continuous process by which a system's `Ki` (resonant pattern) loses informational integrity and dissipates into ambient noise. This entropic decay is a baseline condition for all coherent structures but is significantly accelerated by the intense, shared temporal pressure (V_Γ) generated during a Resonant Test. The degradation rate serves as the ultimate arbiter in a duel, causing the less efficient system to fracture.

          Induce a Resonant Test between a target system and a reference exciter within a controlled volume. Using a high-cadence observer, measure the spectral amplitude and line-width of the target's primary resonant frequency (`Ki`). The rate of exponential decay of the peak amplitude, corrected for baseline environmental dissipation, is a direct measure of δ_c.

      Every contest is audited by entropy. The Resonant Test is an information-rich but entropically expensive process. It accelerates Coherence Degradation by forcing both systems into a state of high stress, expending immense energy simply to maintain form. Victory, therefore, belongs not to the most powerful, but to the most *efficient*.

    excerpt: |
      The impartial arbiter is the principle of Coherence Degradation. The duel ends when one system can no longer afford the energetic cost of maintaining its `Ki` against the overwhelming pressure. Its pattern fractures, its information dissipates, and it dissolves back into the ambient noise of the Temporal Forge.

      justification: |
        Decoherence describes the loss of quantum information from a system to its environment due to interaction, causing the loss of quantum properties. Coherence Degradation is a generalization of this concept, where the "environment" is a specific, adversarial system, and the information loss leads to structural failure.

        δ_c ∝ σ = dS_internal/dt
      justification: |
        The source text emphasizes the process as "entropically expensive" and driven by "efficiency." This maps directly to irreversible thermodynamics, where entropy production (σ) measures the rate of dissipation and disordering within a system driven away from equilibrium. δ_c is the informational consequence of this physical process.

    - target: Thermodynamic Entropy Production (σ)
      rationale: The framework's emphasis on energetic cost, efficiency, and entropy as an "auditor" aligns more strongly with the language and mechanics of non-equilibrium thermodynamics than with the specifics of quantum state vector collapse.

    Distinguish from De-phasing, which is the loss of a specific phase relationship between components of a system without immediate loss of the system's total informational content. Coherence Degradation is the irreversible dissipation of the core information constituting the pattern itself, equivalent to an increase in its internal entropy.

# Coherence Degradation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The lawful, continuous process by which a system's `Ki` (resonant pattern) loses informational integrity and dissipates into ambient noise. This entropic decay is a baseline condition for all coherent structures but is significantly accelerated by the intense, shared temporal pressure (V_Γ) generated during a Resonant Test. The degradation rate serves as the ultimate arbiter in a duel, causing the less efficient system to fracture.

## EFT-First Summary
In an Effective Field Theory context, Coherence Degradation maps to the rate of internal entropy production (σ) within a system's volume, particularly when it is strongly coupled to an external, adversarial field (the dueling partner). The interaction term, represented by the potential `V_Γ`, acts as a driver that pushes the system far from equilibrium. This increases dissipation and accelerates the rate of information loss, leading to pattern instability and fracture when the degradation rate overwhelms the system's self-stabilizing mechanisms.
