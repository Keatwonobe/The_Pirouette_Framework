      snippet: |
        An idea, in its raw state, is a turbulent storm—a surge of resonance without form. The first and most sacred task of a Weaver is to give this knowledge a body: a single, whole form that can speak the language of human intuition and the language of machine logic with the same voice.

triad:
  art: |
    To be a Weaver is to be an alchemist of ideas, transforming the turbulent chaos of raw resonance into a stable, coherent form. The Weaver's art is to give knowledge a body that sings to humans and speaks to machines in a single voice.
  law: |
    A Weaver must produce a single `.pmd` source file that successfully compiles into both a human-readable Codex (PDF) and a machine-parseable Signal (JSON). Failure to produce both outputs from the single source indicates a failure in the Weaver's task of synthesis.
  philosophy: |
    The role of the Weaver embodies the framework's core principle of synthesis. It rejects the false dichotomy between poetic freedom and logical rigor, positing that true coherence is achieved only when form and narrative are unified in a single, disciplined act of creation.
pirouette_definition: |
  The authoring agent, human or otherwise, responsible for translating a raw, high-pressure concept into a stable, high-coherence Pirouette Module Definition (`.pmd`) file. The Weaver operates the 'loom' of the `.pmd` format to synthesize a structured Blueprint (YAML) and a flowing Narrative (Markdown), creating a single artifact that is simultaneously legible to human intuition and machine logic. This act is a practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, navigating temporal pressure to produce both a static Codex for contemplation and a dynamic Signal for systemic integration.

        outline: |
          Assess the output of a Weaver by submitting their authored `.pmd` module to the Forge. The primary test is a binary success/failure of compilation into valid Codex (PDF) and Signal (JSON) formats. Secondary metrics include evaluating the Signal's structural integrity against the framework schema and analyzing the Narrative's clarity and semantic density using standard NLP models.

        pitfalls: [YAML syntax errors breaking the Blueprint, Markdown ambiguity corrupting the Narrative, Mismatch between Blueprint claims and Narrative content]

    excerpt: |
      An idea, in its raw state, is a turbulent storm—a surge of resonance without form. The first and most sacred task of a Weaver is to give this knowledge a body: a single, whole form that can speak the language of human intuition and the language of machine logic with the same voice. To write a module is to perform this act of definition, transforming a chaotic, high-pressure state into a stable, high-coherence pattern that can propagate without loss.
  - module: DOMA-015
    excerpt: |
      By defining the module's `id`, `parents`, `dependencies`, and `keywords`, the Weaver performs a precise act of placement. They answer the questions: From where does this idea draw its strength? Where does it fit in the great tapestry? What other threads does it touch? This structured YAML is the riverbed, the stable geometry that grounds the module and gives it a place within the whole.

        The mapping is adopted due to its direct conceptual parallel. The term 'Weaver' is used to elevate the role beyond mere documentation or coding, highlighting the required synthesis of art and logic central to the framework's philosophy.

  claims:
    - statement: "A proficient Weaver can produce a module where the narrative (Markdown) and the blueprint (YAML) are so tightly integrated that changing one logically necessitates a change in the other."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "The existence of a large corpus of ratified modules where the blueprint and narrative can be altered independently without loss of coherence or function would falsify this claim."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a 'compiler' or 'forge,' which are automated processes that act upon the Weaver's output. The Weaver is the generative agent; the forge is the transformative process. The term also differs from a generic 'author' by implying a strict adherence to the `.pmd` loom and the goal of dual-output synthesis.

# Weaver

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The authoring agent, human or otherwise, responsible for translating a raw, high-pressure concept into a stable, high-coherence Pirouette Module Definition (`.pmd`) file. The Weaver operates the 'loom' of the `.pmd` format to synthesize a structured Blueprint (YAML) and a flowing Narrative (Markdown), creating a single artifact that is simultaneously legible to human intuition and machine logic. This act is a practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, navigating temporal pressure to produce both a static Codex for contemplation and a dynamic Signal for systemic integration.

## Operational Summary
In terms analogous to software development, the Weaver is the disciplined programmer-author who creates the source code (`.pmd`) for a system component. Their work is not considered complete until this source can be compiled into both its functional, machine-readable form (the Signal) and its human-readable design documentation (the Codex), with both targets generated from the identical source file. This dual-output requirement enforces a deep synthesis of logic and description.
