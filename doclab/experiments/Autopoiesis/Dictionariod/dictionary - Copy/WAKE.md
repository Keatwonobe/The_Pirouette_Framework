        As established in `CORE-011`, any resonant pattern leaves a persistent geometric scar in the coherence manifold—a "wake." A system in motion relative to its geodesic is therefore perpetually interacting with the ghost of its own immediate past.

    A traveler's shadow, etched into the fabric of time. It is the lingering scent of passage, a memory of presence that clings and pulls at the one who made it.
  law: |
    A system moving relative to its local geodesic generates a wake in the coherence manifold, resulting in a self-interaction (Inertial Drag) that is proportional to the deviation from the geodesic and which manifests as a measurable decrease in its Temporal Coherence (T₀).
  philosophy: |
    The wake makes history tangible and consequential at the most fundamental level. It ensures that motion is not free, that every action has a cost, and that a system's past is an active participant in its present, creating the friction against which coherence must be perpetually re-asserted.

  A persistent, localized distortion in the geometry of the coherence manifold, generated by the passage of a resonant system. The wake acts as a source of temporal friction, creating a potential field (`V_Γ`) through which the system must move. This self-interaction, termed Inertial Drag, forces the system to expend coherence to maintain its pattern, directly causing velocity-dependent time dilation.

        outline: |
          Measure the Temporal Coherence (T₀) of a test system (e.g., a high-stability atomic clock) as its velocity is varied relative to its local geodesic. The wake's effect (Inertial Drag) is inferred from the non-linear decrease in T₀ as velocity increases, after accounting for all other environmental contributions to Γ. The functional form of this decrease reveals the wake's field properties.

    excerpt: |
      Velocity (Inertial Drag): Moving off the geodesic increases the effective `V_Γ` through self-interaction with the wake. To maximize the action, the system's optimal strategy is to lower its internal frequency (`ω_k`), thereby preserving the highest possible T₀.

        The wake's Inertial Drag is conceptually analogous to radiation reaction forces in classical electrodynamics. In both cases, a moving entity interacts with the field it generates, creating a self-induced drag force that opposes changes in motion. The wake is the temporal-field equivalent of the electromagnetic field radiated by an accelerating charge.

    In Pirouette, 'wake' specifically refers to a geometric feature in the *coherence manifold*, not a disturbance in a physical medium. Its effects are temporal (Inertial Drag), not kinetic friction.

# wake

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A persistent, localized distortion in the geometry of the coherence manifold, generated by the passage of a resonant system. The wake acts as a source of temporal friction, creating a potential field (`V_Γ`) through which the system must move. This self-interaction, termed Inertial Drag, forces the system to expend coherence to maintain its pattern, directly causing velocity-dependent time dilation.

## EFT-First Summary
The wake can be modeled as a higher-derivative operator in the system's worldline effective action, representing self-interaction mediated by the background coherence field. This term is analogous to the radiation-reaction terms in electrodynamics (e.g., Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac force), introducing a dissipative effect that opposes changes in motion relative to the local geodesic. Its coefficient would depend on the system's internal degrees of freedom, leading to species-dependent corrections to the standard relativistic kinetic term.
