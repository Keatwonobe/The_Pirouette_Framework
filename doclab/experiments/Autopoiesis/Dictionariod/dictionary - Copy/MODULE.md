  art: |
    A module is a single, signed theorem on a scroll; a distinct packet of logic that can be held up to the light, debated, and replaced without tearing the whole library down. It atomizes truth into negotiable, testable units.
  law: |
    A module must have a versioned ID, a status (`draft`, `stable`, `deprecated`), and explicit parent/test dependencies. It can only be altered via a ratified debate process that yields exactly one of three moves: EXPAND, MERGE, or REVISION.
  philosophy: |
    To make knowledge atomic, governable, and falsifiable. Modules replace monolithic, unversioned doctrine with a versioned, directed graph of testable claims, enabling the structured and auditable evolution of the framework.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Module is a versioned, self-contained unit of technical knowledge within the Pirouette Framework, identified by a unique ID (e.g., `CORE-003`). Each module possesses a defined status (`draft`, `stable`, `deprecated`), explicit dependencies (`parents`), test bindings (`tests`), and provenance. It serves as the atomic subject for governable change via the Debate Instrument (`INST-DEB-001`), which enforces evolution through one of three discrete operations: EXPAND, MERGE, or REVISION.

          Execute repository CI gates on the module file.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'Module' refers to the versioned, human-readable knowledge artifacts (e.g., `CORE-003.md`), not to code modules. The concepts are analogous in their emphasis on encapsulation and explicit interfaces (via `parents` and `tests`), but the content is technical prose, equations, and schemas rather than executable code.

# Module

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Module is a versioned, self-contained unit of technical knowledge within the Pirouette Framework, identified by a unique ID (e.g., `CORE-003`). Each module possesses a defined status (`draft`, `stable`, `deprecated`), explicit dependencies (`parents`), test bindings (`tests`), and provenance. It serves as the atomic subject for governable change via the Debate Instrument (`INST-DEB-001`), which enforces evolution through one of three discrete operations: EXPAND, MERGE, or REVISION.

## Software Engineering Analogy
A Pirouette Module functions like a versioned software package. It has a unique ID (`CORE-003`), version (`1.1`), dependencies (`parents`), and is validated by automated integrity checks (`CI Gates`). The formal debate process is analogous to a structured, automated pull request system for safely evolving the knowledge base.
