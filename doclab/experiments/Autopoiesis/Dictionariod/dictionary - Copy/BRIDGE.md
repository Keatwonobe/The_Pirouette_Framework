  art: |
    The Bridge is the universal constitution written into the fabric of the temporal medium. It ensures the smallest threads of gauge physics and the cosmic tapestry of spacetime are woven from the same principles, creating a single, coherent reality.
  law: |
    The relationships between the UV properties of the temporal medium (coherence barrier ω_c, frame stiffnesses) and the emergent IR constants of nature (G_eff, Λ, α_i) are fixed and invariant. Any temporal drift in one constant mandates a specific, correlated drift in the others.
  philosophy: |
    The Bridge enforces autopoietic closure, preventing a schizophrenic universe where microphysics and macrophysics are decoupled. It is the reason the cosmos is self-consistent and knowable, ensuring the laws derived in a lab hold across galaxies.
pirouette_definition: |
  The set of axiomatic, cross-scale relations, principally defined in Substrate Rule 6 (SR-6), that bind the properties of the temporal medium to emergent physical constants. The Bridge functionally connects the coherence barrier (ω_c) and substrate stiffness ratios to the effective gravitational constant (G_eff), the cosmological constant (Λ_Pirouette), and the gauge couplings ({α, α₂, α₃}). It acts as the immutable "atlas" of physical constants, ensuring the mathematical and physical closure of the framework.

          Perform long-term, high-precision monitoring of fundamental constants using independent astrophysical and terrestrial methods. This includes lunar laser ranging (for G), analysis of quasar absorption spectra (for α), and atomic clock comparisons. The goal is to set parts-per-trillion-per-year bounds on any temporal variation.

        The Bridge provides explicit relations connecting a UV scale (ω_c) to IR observables (G, Λ). This is conceptually analogous to UV/IR mixing in some QFTs or swampland conjectures in string theory, where properties of the low-energy effective theory are constrained by the consistency of its UV completion.

# Bridge

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The set of axiomatic, cross-scale relations, principally defined in Substrate Rule 6 (SR-6), that bind the properties of the temporal medium to emergent physical constants. The Bridge functionally connects the coherence barrier (ω_c) and substrate stiffness ratios to the effective gravitational constant (G_eff), the cosmological constant (Λ_Pirouette), and the gauge couplings ({α, α₂, α₃}). It acts as the immutable "atlas" of physical constants, ensuring the mathematical and physical closure of the framework.

## EFT-First Summary
The Bridge provides a set of UV/IR mixing relations that fix the values of low-energy constants, such as the gravitational and gauge couplings, in terms of the properties of a high-energy substrate. It predicts that these "constants" are extremely stable over cosmological time, with any potential drift being small and correlated across different constants. This is conceptually similar to how swampland criteria in string theory constrain low-energy effective field theories.
