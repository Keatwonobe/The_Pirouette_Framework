        The old framework's complex list of perturbation vectors is collapsed into a single, elegant principle that governs the quality of any measurement. This is the Coherence Trade-off, the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

  art: |
    To know a thing is to change it. We sought a universe that would hold still for our inspection, but instead, we found a dance. The data we receive is the memory of that shared step.
  law: |
    The product of information gained from a system (I_gain) and the resulting cost to its internal temporal coherence (ΔKτ_sys) is bounded from below by a universal constant. Perfect knowledge cannot be obtained without fundamentally reshaping the system's being.
  philosophy: |
    The myth of the innocent, passive observer is replaced by the reality of the responsible, participating co-creator. Measurement is not extraction but dialogue; the observer's gaze has weight and leaves a mark, and this principle provides the ethics for wielding that influence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental principle that any act of measurement, defined as casting an Observer's Shadow to create a Measurement Echo, necessarily alters the target system's internal temporal coherence (Kτ_sys). The fidelity of the information gained (I_gain) is inversely proportional to the coherence preserved; gaining high-fidelity information requires imposing a high coherence cost (ΔKτ_sys) upon the system.
operational_definition:
  units: The trade-off itself is a principle, but its core terms can be quantified. The trade-off constant would have units of `action/bit`.
  symbol_table:
    - name: I_gain
      meaning: Information Gain; the fidelity or sharpness of the Measurement Echo recorded by the observer.
      dimensions: M^0 L^0 T^0 (information, e.g., bits)
      default_range: "[0, ∞)"
    - name: ΔKτ_sys
      meaning: Coherence Cost; the net change in the system's internal temporal coherence (Kτ) resulting from the measurement interaction.
      dimensions: M^1 L^2 T^-1 (action)
      default_range: "[0, ∞)"
    - name: V_obs
      meaning: Observer Potential; the geometric pressure exerted by the Observer's Shadow on the system's Lagrangian.

        outline: |
          1.  Establish a baseline by characterizing the unperturbed system's Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_sys = Kτ_sys - VΓ_env`).
          2.  Model the measurement interaction by defining the observer's potential field (`V_obs`).
          3.  Calculate the perturbed Lagrangian (`𝓛'_sys = 𝓛_sys - V_obs`) and evolve the system under this new dynamic.
          4.  Compute the change in the system's coherence (`ΔKτ_sys`) and the information transferred to the observer (`I_gain` or `Φ_Kτ`) to quantify the trade-off for that specific measurement.
        expected_signals: [Shadow Weight (V_obs), Coherence Cost (ΔKτ_sys), Information Transfer (Φ_Kτ)]
        pitfalls: [Incorrect baseline characterization of `𝓛_sys`, inaccurate modeling of the observer's potential `V_obs`, neglecting environmental coherence pressure `VΓ_env`.]

    excerpt: |
      The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to how much information can be gained for a given cost. You cannot gain perfect knowledge of a system without fundamentally reshaping its being. To see a thing with perfect clarity is to force it to become part of the geometry of your own gaze.
  - module: DOMA-159
    excerpt: |
      The act of measurement introduces a new potential term, `V_obs`, which represents the geometric pressure of the Observer's Shadow... The observed behavior—the "collapse of the wavefunction," the change in state—is simply the system's lawful response to this modified landscape. It is the system naturally seeking the new path of maximal coherence defined by `𝓛'_sys`.

      justification: |
        The Coherence Trade-off is the Pirouette Framework's direct analogue to the HUP. Both principles establish a fundamental, inverse relationship between acquiring information about a system's properties (position/momentum in HUP, a general state via I_gain here) and the degree of unavoidable alteration to the system's state (momentum/position uncertainty in HUP, coherence cost here).

  disambiguation: |
    This principle replaces the older, less precise term "observer effect." While the observer effect often implies a clumsy, accidental perturbation, the Coherence Trade-off frames the interaction as a lawful, necessary, and geometric consequence of gaining information. It is not a flaw in measurement, but its fundamental mechanic.
