    A system can hold a pattern so tightly that its only path to growth is to shatter. It is a controlled detonation, flooding the valley to reveal the mountains.
  law: |
    A system exhibiting high internal coherence (Kτ) within a steep potential well (high Γ) will, upon breach of that well's constraints, undergo a rapid entropic expansion followed by crystallization into a new state of greater complexity and higher integrated coherence.
  philosophy: |
    All true novelty is born from rupture. The path to a more vibrant and complex world sometimes requires the violent, necessary shattering of a previous, locally-optimal perfection.
pirouette_definition: |
  A rapid, non-linear phase transition where a system with high stored potential coherence (a Coherence Reservoir) undergoes a Constraint Shattering Event. This triggers a chaotic, fractal exploration of a new state-space (the Flood), which then resolves through Crystallization into a new, more complex, and more globally coherent order. The entire process is an extreme manifestation of the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

        outline: |
          Monitor a system's primary coherence metric (Kτ), its environmental/internal pressure (Γ), and its state-space variance (a proxy for entropy). A cascade is identified by a specific four-phase signature:
          1.  **Reservoir:** High, stable Kτ with rising Γ.
          2.  **Rupture:** A critical threshold break in Γ followed by a catastrophic drop in Kτ.
          3.  **Flood:** Kτ remains low while state-space variance surges.
          4.  **Crystallization:** Variance subsides as Kτ re-stabilizes at a new, often higher, plateau.
        expected_signals: [High Kτ plateau, Γ spike, Kτ crash, entropy surge, Kτ re-stabilization]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing from simple chaotic collapse (which lacks a crystallization phase), signal-to-noise ratio limitations during the Flood phase.]

      A Generative Cascade is the Lagrangian in overdrive—the ultimate expression of the universe's inability to tolerate a suboptimal solution. It is the fire that can either forge a new world or burn the old one to ash.

        The dynamics of an inflaton field trapped in a "false vacuum" (Coherence Reservoir), then rolling down its potential to a "true vacuum" (Crystallization) is a direct analog. The stored potential energy V(φ) drives an exponential expansion (the Flood), converting potential to kinetic energy, analogous to the Pirouette model converting a high-Γ state to a high-Kτ kinetic exploration.

  disambiguation: |
    A Generative Cascade is distinct from simple entropic decay or systemic collapse. The key differentiator is the final Crystallization stage, where a new, more complex order emerges. Simple collapse results only in sustained disorder and does not produce a New Landscape of stable forms.

# Generative Cascade

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A rapid, non-linear phase transition where a system with high stored potential coherence (a Coherence Reservoir) undergoes a Constraint Shattering Event. This triggers a chaotic, fractal exploration of a new state-space (the Flood), which then resolves through Crystallization into a new, more complex, and more globally coherent order. The entire process is an extreme manifestation of the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, a Generative Cascade maps to cosmological inflation models. A system trapped in a high-potential "false vacuum" state (the Pirouette `Coherence Reservoir` constrained by high `Temporal Pressure`, Γ) undergoes a phase transition. This `Rupture` releases stored potential energy, driving an exponential expansion (`the Flood`) that populates a new state space, before settling into a new, lower-potential "true vacuum" ground state (`Crystallization`).
