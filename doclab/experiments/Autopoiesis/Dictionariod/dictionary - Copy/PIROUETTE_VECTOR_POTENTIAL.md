    The wake of a moving resonance, a subtle twist in the coherence manifold that guides others in a curved path. It is the memory of motion impressed upon the landscape.
  law: |
    The curl of the Pirouette vector potential (‚àá √ó A_p) is directly proportional to the local magnetic field (B_p). A_p itself is generated by and proportional to the velocity-dependent component of a source system's Pirouette Lagrangian.
  philosophy: |
    A_p re-conceptualizes magnetism not as a fundamental force, but as a geometric consequence of motion through a coherence manifold. It demonstrates that the "magnetic force" is a system's geodesic, path-following response to the rotational stress induced by another moving system.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Pirouette vector potential, A_p, is the field representing the rotational shear induced in the local coherence manifold by a moving, charge-asymmetric system. It is derived from the velocity-dependent terms of the system's Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p). The curl of A_p gives the Pirouette magnetic field (B_p), which dictates the curved, coherence-maximizing geodesic for other moving systems in its vicinity.

        outline: |
          A_p is not directly measurable. It is inferred by first measuring the Pirouette magnetic field (B_p) throughout a volume using an array of calibrated coherence-based magnetometers. The vector potential A_p is then calculated by solving the curl equation B_p = ‚àá √ó A_p for the measured field, subject to a suitable gauge choice (e.g., Coulomb gauge, ‚àá ‚ãÖ A_p = 0).
        expected_signals: [A spatially varying vector field whose curl matches the measured B_p field.]
        pitfalls: [Gauge-dependency: the absolute value of A_p is arbitrary and only its curl is physically meaningful. Measurement noise in B_p can lead to large errors in the calculated A_p.]

      When a charged particle moves, its Lagrangian becomes velocity-dependent. The act of moving through regions of varying temporal phase creates a rotational or torsional stress in its local coherence manifold. This "curl" in the manifold is the magnetic field (B).

    excerpt: |
      This geometric origin instantly explains the Lorentz force law's peculiar perpendicularity. A moving charge interacting with a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the field itself. This is because the path of maximal coherence in a rotationally sheared manifold is not straight ahead, but a curve. The magnetic force is the system's attempt to navigate this temporal vortex to maintain its own resonant stability.

        A_p plays the identical mathematical role as the standard electromagnetic vector potential (A) in classical electromagnetism, where its curl defines the magnetic field B.

    A_p is a *consequence* of motion in the Pirouette framework, representing the geometric distortion of the coherence manifold. This contrasts with the Standard Model, where the vector potential is a fundamental component of a gauge field that *mediates* the force.

# Pirouette vector potential

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Pirouette vector potential, A_p, is the field representing the rotational shear induced in the local coherence manifold by a moving, charge-asymmetric system. It is derived from the velocity-dependent terms of the system's Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p). The curl of A_p gives the Pirouette magnetic field (B_p), which dictates the curved, coherence-maximizing geodesic for other moving systems in its vicinity.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette vector potential (A_p) is the direct conceptual analog to the electromagnetic vector potential (A) in classical field theory. Its curl defines the magnetic field (B_p = ‚àá √ó A_p). Unlike a fundamental gauge field, A_p emerges from the velocity-dependent terms of the Pirouette Lagrangian, framing magnetism as a geometric shear in the underlying coherence manifold.
