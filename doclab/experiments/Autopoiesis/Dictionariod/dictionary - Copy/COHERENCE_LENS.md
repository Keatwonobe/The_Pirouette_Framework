    A river can be muddied by a storm or poisoned by a single drop. This lens is a tuning fork that distinguishes the storm's chaotic roar from the clear, resonant note of the poison, revealing the hidden ventriloquist in the crowd.

    The anomalous efficiency of a narrative is a direct signature of manipulation. The Resonant Gain (G_R), the ratio of systemic impact to injection energy, will be orders of magnitude greater for an engineered narrative than for an organic one (G_R >> 1).
  philosophy: |
    Cognitive sovereignty requires the ability to distinguish an internal, authentic voice from a pervasive, external echo. The lens provides an instrument for this discernment, not to silence voices, but to ensure the song a civilization hears is truly its own.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence Lens is an instrumentation protocol for diagnosing the health of an information ecosystem. It distinguishes organic narratives from manipulation by measuring Resonant Gain (G_R)—the ratio of a narrative's emergent Coherence Flux (ΔKτ) to its estimated Injection Pressure (Γ_inj). An anomalously high G_R indicates a low-energy, high-coherence injection, the signature of a managed narrative exploiting a system's latent resonances or Wound Channels.

      The old paradigm of media analysis was a form of taxidermy, studying static artifacts after the fact. This module reframes the task as one of live, systemic diagnosis. The Coherence Lens is an instrument designed to detect a specific pathology: **injected coherence**. It operates on the core principle that manipulation reveals itself through *anomalous efficiency*.

    excerpt: |
      A managed narrative is a `Ki` pattern that has been deliberately shaped to align with a deep **Wound Channel (CORE-011)** in the collective psyche... Such a system exists in a state of high potential, poised on a "coherence cliff edge." The manipulative act—a **Daedalus Gambit (DYNA-003)**—is a minimal energy nudge (`δΓ_inj`) that pushes the system over this edge.

        The Q factor of an oscillator measures its resonance sharpness. A high-Q system (like a high-potential information ecosystem) exhibits a large amplitude response for a small driving force near its resonant frequency. G_R is conceptually analogous to Q, where Γ_inj is the driving force and ΔKτ is the amplitude response.

# Coherence Lens

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Coherence Lens is an instrumentation protocol for diagnosing the health of an information ecosystem. It distinguishes organic narratives from manipulation by measuring Resonant Gain (G_R)—the ratio of a narrative's emergent Coherence Flux (ΔKτ) to its estimated Injection Pressure (Γ_inj). An anomalously high G_R indicates a low-energy, high-coherence injection, the signature of a managed narrative exploiting a system's latent resonances or Wound Channels.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Lens is an instrument for measuring the equivalent of a Quality or 'Q' factor for a narrative within an information ecosystem. Just as a high-Q mechanical resonator amplifies a small, tuned input, a narrative space with latent instabilities (Wound Channels) can be driven into a high-coherence state by a minimal, targeted 'push'. The lens quantifies this gain, identifying narratives that achieve systemic resonance with an anomalously low energy cost, a key signature of external manipulation.
