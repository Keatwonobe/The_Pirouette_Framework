        The Scalpel is a diagnostic tool that uses the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) to move from transcription to prescription.
        1.  **Locate the Geodesic:** First, apply the Lagrangian to the transcribed coherence data to determine the system's ideal evolutionary path—its geodesic of maximal coherence...
        2.  **Isolate the Critical Fractures:** Second, use Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA) to find where the system's actual history deviates most sharply from its geodesic... The output is a short, actionable list of the system's primary wounds.

    To find where the song went wrong, one must first know the true melody. The Scalpel listens for the dissonance between what is and what should be, isolating the single broken string that ruins the harmony.
  law: |
    A system's greatest loss of coherence originates from the minimal set of historical events where its actual trajectory deviated most significantly from its calculated geodesic. This set of "critical fractures" follows a Pareto-like distribution, where a minority of events cause a majority of the total deviation.
  philosophy: |
    The Scalpel embodies the framework's ethical imperative to not merely describe a system's suffering (its loss of coherence) but to precisely locate its source. It transforms abstract analysis into an actionable, surgical prescription for healing, moving the Weaver from observer to physician.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Scalpel is the second stage of the Coherence Auditor protocol, a diagnostic process that quantifies a system's deviation from its ideal evolutionary path. It operates by first using the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) to compute the system's geodesic of maximal coherence, then applying Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA) to the system's actual historical coherence data to identify the critical fractures—the minimal set of events responsible for the maximal coherence loss.
operational_definition:
  units: The primary output is a ranked list of events. The associated metric, coherence loss (δKτ), is dimensionless or carries the units of the system's specific Coherence (Kτ).

        outline: |
          1. **Input**: Receive the transcribed coherence time-series Kτ(t)_actual from The Lens.
          2. **Geodesic Calculation**: Apply the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) to the boundary conditions and constraints of the system to solve for its ideal coherence path, Kτ(t)_geodesic.
          3. **Deviation Analysis**: Calculate the coherence loss δKτ(t) = |Kτ(t)_geodesic - Kτ(t)_actual| for all points in the time-series.
          4. **Pareto Ranking**: Perform Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA) on the set of {δKτ(tᵢ)} values to identify the ~20% of events responsible for ~80% of the total integrated coherence loss.
          5. **Output**: Return a short, ranked list of these critical fracture events and their associated δKτ magnitudes.
        expected_signals: [A time-series of coherence loss (δKτ), a Pareto distribution of event impacts.]
        pitfalls: [Poor data quality from The Lens stage, incorrect system boundary definition leading to an inaccurate geodesic, non-stationarity of system dynamics invalidating a single geodesic over the entire history.]

    excerpt: |
      Once the song is transcribed, we can listen for the sour notes. The Scalpel is a diagnostic tool that uses the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) to move from transcription to prescription. First, apply the Lagrangian to the transcribed coherence data to determine the system's ideal evolutionary path—its geodesic of maximal coherence. This is the framework's predictive power, revealing the "path of least resistance" the system *should* be following.

    excerpt: |
      The Scalpel, analyzing this signal against the company's ideal path of profit maximization, might pinpoint that a single, ill-advised acquisition is the critical fracture responsible for the majority of subsequent market share loss.

      domain: Math
      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        The Scalpel's function of identifying points of maximal deviation from a model (the geodesic) is operationally equivalent to anomaly detection in time-series analysis. The geodesic serves as the baseline model, and critical fractures are the most significant anomalies.

      justification: |
        Conceptually, the geodesic represents the "classical path" of least action. The system's actual history is a specific, noisy path. The Scalpel identifies the points where "quantum-like" fluctuations away from the classical path were most impactful or destructive to the system's coherence.

    The Scalpel is a diagnostic tool for analyzing history; it is not a predictive tool for future events, although its findings inform such predictions. It must be distinguished from 'The Lens,' which is the preceding data preparation stage. The Lens transcribes the song; The Scalpel finds the sour notes.
