        Mathematics is **invented syntax** exploring many possible grammars.
        **Pirouette** selects the fragments whose invariants *stabilize* the temporal medium: these fragments behave like a **stabilizer grammar** for SR-0…6.
        We call this selective adhesion **stickiness**. It is *not* a theological claim that “all math exists”; it’s a **diagnostic** for which invented formalisms become **physically load-bearing**.

    We invent nets. The loom keeps only what catches its threads with less and less mesh. The rest we hang on the wall—beautiful, instructive, and waiting for another ocean.
  law: |
    A mathematical formalism is physically relevant ('Pirouette') if and only if it passes the three gates of the Pirouette-Compliance Test (PCT) and demonstrates high Stickiness (Stk) and Reverse Pareto leverage (RPA).
  philosophy: |
    Mathematics is a creative human endeavor, not a discovery of pre-existing truths. Its physical effectiveness is a contingent, emergent property arising from an autopoietic feedback loop where formalisms that stabilize the substrate and compress its description are selectively amplified.
pirouette_definition: |
  The philosophical stance that all mathematics is a human invention, a collection of formal systems (grammars). The Pirouette Framework does not treat these systems as a priori truths. Instead, their physical relevance is an empirical question, diagnosed by whether they act as a **stabilizer grammar** for the substrate (SR-0…6). Physically 'sticky' or 'load-bearing' mathematics is the subset of invented syntax that passes the Pirouette-Compliance Test (PCT) by commuting with physical maps (like Σ), efficiently encoding conserved quantities, compressing physical derivations, and producing falsifiable predictions.

      dimensions: boolean
      default_range: "Pass/Fail"

        outline: |
          1. For a candidate mathematical domain `D`, author a "domain card" sketching its Σ-Compatibility, stabilizer yield, and a proposed falsifiable prediction.
          2. Re-derive benchmark results (e.g., GR hydrolimit, YM emergence) using `D`, recording the change in Minimum Description Length (MDL).
          3. Compute the `Stk` score from its four components (S,Y,C,P) and the `RPA` score from the axiom-to-consequence leverage.
          4. Evaluate `D` against the three PCT gates. A domain passing all gates with `Stk >= 0.6` and `RPA >= τ` (historical threshold) is promoted to 'pirouette' status.
        expected_signals: [Pass on all three PCT gates, significant MDL reduction on benchmark derivations, high Stk/RPA scores logged to `/analysis/math_adhesion/ledger.csv`]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking notational convenience for genuine compression (MDL), setting a weak falsifiability gate (PCT-3), failing to maintain constant-ledger discipline.]

      Your lens: *“math is invented; the sticky pieces feed back with the geometry that uses them.”* We model this with an **autopoietic learning dynamic**... Interpretation: **marketing of the mind**—attention hovers on structures with resonance; those structures, once in use, *reduce* future description length and therefore attract *more* attention. That’s stickiness formalized.

        Invented Syntax is the direct philosophical opponent of Platonism. It posits that mathematical structures are created, not discovered, and replaces the metaphysical question "Is it true?" with the operational question "Is it sticky/load-bearing for this substrate?".

        Aligns with formalism's view of math as symbol manipulation according to rules, but adds a physical selection principle (the Pirouette Test) to distinguish physically relevant formalisms from merely consistent ones. It provides a mechanism for why some formal games are "unreasonably effective."

    Distinguish 'Invented syntax' (the philosophical stance that all math is created) from a 'stabilizer grammar' (the functional role a 'sticky' syntax plays). The former is the set of all possible nets; the latter is the specific net the loom uses.

# Invented syntax

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The philosophical stance that all mathematics is a human invention, a collection of formal systems (grammars). The Pirouette Framework does not treat these systems as a priori truths. Instead, their physical relevance is an empirical question, diagnosed by whether they act as a **stabilizer grammar** for the substrate (SR-0…6). Physically 'sticky' or 'load-bearing' mathematics is the subset of invented syntax that passes the Pirouette-Compliance Test (PCT) by commuting with physical maps (like Σ), efficiently encoding conserved quantities, compressing physical derivations, and producing falsifiable predictions.

## EFT-First Summary
This is a meta-theoretical concept concerning the choice of mathematical formalism. It has no direct EFT analog. It functions as a selection principle, arguing that the mathematical structures underlying effective field theories (e.g., Lie groups, fiber bundles, differential geometry) are not divinely ordained but were selected—and are continually refined—based on their operational ability to compress physical law and generate falsifiable predictions within our universe's specific constraints.
