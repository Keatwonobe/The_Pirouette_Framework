    What flows in must flow out; coherence, like water, is never lost, only moved. Its presence in a volume is a memory of its journey across the boundary, a testament to the conservation of order.
  law: |
    The local rate of change of coherence density within any region is equal to the net flux of coherence through its boundary. Mathematically, ∂μJμ = 0, where Jμ is the conserved coherence four-current.
  philosophy: |
    This law establishes a fundamental symmetry—phase invariance—as the origin of a conserved quantity, coherence. It provides the unifying principle that links physical, cognitive, and social dynamics, asserting that order and resonance are not spontaneously created or destroyed, but merely redistributed.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Continuity of Coherence Law (CCL) is the conservation law derived via the Noether-Pirouette correspondence from the phase invariance of the Pirouette Lagrangian. It states that the coherence four-current, Jμ, is divergenceless (∂μJμ = 0). In its expanded form, ∂t(ρ_C) + ∇ ⋅ J_C = 0, it equates the temporal change in coherence density (ρ_C = T_a ω_k) to the spatial flux of coherence (J_C = Γ∇C), thereby linking time adherence, phase winding, temporal pressure, and the coherence field into a single dynamic equation.

          1. Define a control volume V in a system (e.g., a neural assembly, a social group).
          2. Measure the integrated coherence density ∫ρ_C dV inside the volume over time to find its rate of change, d/dt(∫ρ_C dV).
          3. Simultaneously, measure the coherence field C and temporal pressure Γ at the boundary S of the volume.
          4. Calculate the total flux through the boundary, ∮J_C ⋅ dA = ∮(Γ∇C) ⋅ dA.

      A small perturbation under a local phase transformation (δC = iεC) yields a conserved **coherence current** analogous to electric current: Jμ = (∂Lp/∂(∂μC))δC, and thus ∂μJμ = 0. This defines the **Continuity of Coherence Law (CCL)**: The rate of change of coherence within any region equals the flux of coherence through its boundary.

It is the direct analogue of the conservation of electric charge in electromagnetism (∂μJμ_em = 0) and the conservation of probability in quantum mechanics.

    While mathematically a standard continuity equation, the term "Continuity of Coherence" or "CCL" should be used to specify that the conserved quantity is Pirouette coherence (C), governed by its specific dynamics (e.g., the flux term Γ∇C), distinguishing it from the conservation of mass, charge, or energy.

# Continuity of Coherence Law

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Continuity of Coherence Law (CCL) is the conservation law derived via the Noether-Pirouette correspondence from the phase invariance of the Pirouette Lagrangian. It states that the coherence four-current, Jμ, is divergenceless (∂μJμ = 0). In its expanded form, ∂t(ρ_C) + ∇ ⋅ J_C = 0, it equates the temporal change in coherence density (ρ_C = T_a ω_k) to the spatial flux of coherence (J_C = Γ∇C), thereby linking time adherence, phase winding, temporal pressure, and the coherence field into a single dynamic equation.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of field theory, the CCL is the statement of local coherence conservation, `∂μJμ = 0`, derived from a U(1)-like phase invariance in the Pirouette Lagrangian. It is mathematically identical to the conservation of electric charge in QED or any other conserved Noether current. The law dictates that any local change in coherence density `ρ_C` must be precisely balanced by a spatial flux `J_C`, preventing the spontaneous creation or destruction of coherence within any continuous region of a system.
