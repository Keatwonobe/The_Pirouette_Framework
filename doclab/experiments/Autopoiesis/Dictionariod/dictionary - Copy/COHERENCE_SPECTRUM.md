    A system's musical score made visible. The instrument acts as a prism, splitting the single, composite song of a system into its constituent colors, revealing the full spectrum of its inner life.
  law: |
    A Coherence Spectrum is a two-dimensional representation `CS(t, ω)` of a time-series signal, where the value at coordinates `(t, ω)` is the local Temporal Coherence `Kτ(t, ω)`, calculated as the squared magnitude of the mean phase vector for frequency `ω` at time `t`.
  philosophy: |
    The spectrum transforms system analysis from a holistic, one-dimensional measurement (a single `Kτ` value) into a high-resolution, multi-dimensional diagnosis. It reveals the internal anatomy of a system's resonance, making its health, stability, and state transitions legible as distinct visual patterns.
pirouette_definition: |
  A two-dimensional plot of a system's Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) as a function of time (`t`, x-axis) and frequency (`ω`, y-axis). Generated by applying a harmonic decomposition protocol (the Harmonic Lens) to a time-series signal, it visualizes the system's Temporal Signature, revealing the strength, stability, and evolution of its constituent resonant patterns (`Ki`).

          1. Ingest a time-series signal representing a system's dynamic behavior.
          2. Apply a continuous wavelet transform to decompose the signal into a time-frequency representation.
          3. For each point `(t, ω)`, calculate the local phase coherence using the formula: `Kτ(t, ω) = | (1/N) Σ exp(iθ_j(t,ω)) |^2`, where `θ` is the local phase.
          4. Render the resulting `Kτ` values as a 2D plot with `t` on the x-axis, `ω` on the y-axis, and `Kτ` represented by color or intensity.
        expected_signals: [Sharp harmonic bands (Laminar Flow), broadband low-coherence noise (Turbulent Flow), mode hopping (phase transitions)]
        pitfalls: [Misinterpreting transform artifacts (e.g., edge effects) as physical phenomena, choosing an inappropriate mother wavelet leading to poor time-frequency resolution trade-offs.]

    excerpt: |
      The Harmonic Lens is the primary instrument for analyzing the fine structure of a system's Temporal Resonance (`Ki`). It is a formal protocol that takes the singular, undifferentiated signal of a system's behavior and decomposes it into a visual score. This **Coherence Spectrum** (also called a temporal spectrogram) maps the system's health, stability, and complexity, showing precisely where its coherence is concentrated and where it is being lost to the noise of the Temporal Forge.
  - module: DOMA-193
    excerpt: |
      The Coherence Spectrum is a rich diagnostic document that maps directly to a system's health and its flow state (`DYNA-001`). Sharp, bright, and stable bands represent the system's dominant `Ki` patterns—its fundamental rhythms. This is the signature of a system in a state of **Laminar Flow**. A high, flickering "floor" of low coherence across a wide range of frequencies indicates high ambient **Temporal Pressure (`Γ`)** or a phase transition into **Turbulent Flow**.

      rationale: |
        This mapping is chosen for its operational precision. The protocol explicitly calls for a wavelet transform (yielding a scalogram, a time-frequency map with variable resolution) and calculates phase coherence, distinguishing it from a standard power spectrogram which plots amplitude squared. This method is common in neuroscience for measuring phase-locking.

  disambiguation: |
    The term "spectrogram" in standard signal processing typically plots signal *power* (amplitude squared), not phase coherence. The term "coherence" can also refer to the cross-spectral coherence between two different signals. The Pirouette 'Coherence Spectrum' is always a measure of a single signal's *internal* phase consistency over time and frequency.

# Coherence Spectrum

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A two-dimensional plot of a system's Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) as a function of time (`t`, x-axis) and frequency (`ω`, y-axis). Generated by applying a harmonic decomposition protocol (the Harmonic Lens) to a time-series signal, it visualizes the system's Temporal Signature, revealing the strength, stability, and evolution of its constituent resonant patterns (`Ki`).

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Spectrum is operationally equivalent to a **Phase Coherence Scalogram**, a time-frequency representation generated via a Continuous Wavelet Transform. Instead of plotting signal power like a traditional spectrogram, it plots the local phase coherence, `Kτ(t, ω)`, a dimensionless measure from 0 (total randomness) to 1 (perfect phase-locking) indicating the stability of a signal's rhythm at each frequency over time. It is the primary diagnostic tool for visualizing a system's internal resonant structure and stability against decoherence.
