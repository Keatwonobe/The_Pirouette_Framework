        This structure, the **Chiral Wound Channel**, is the physical manifestation of the Lagrangian gradient. An array of synchronized, rotating elements collaboratively *weaves a stable, helical pattern* into the fabric of spacetime.

    A riverbed carved not in soil but in the potential of spacetime, a self-spun vortex that the weaver then descends. It is the act of generating the wave and then surfing it.
  law: |
    The topological handedness (chirality) of the engineered Wound Channel dictates the direction of the propulsive geodesic. A right-handed helical structure corresponds to forward thrust, a left-handed one to reverse; zero net chirality yields zero net thrust.
  philosophy: |
    The Chiral Wound Channel transforms motion from a brute-force interaction with an external reality into an act of internal re-orchestration. To move is not to push against the universe, but to create a slope within one's own local manifold and follow it.
pirouette_definition: |
  The engineered, self-sustaining, helical structure in the local coherence manifold that serves as the medium for Vorticycle propulsion. It is the physical manifestation of an asymmetric Lagrangian gradient, actively generated by the drive system's chiral modulation of temporal pressure. The system achieves thrust by perpetually creating this channel ahead of itself and following the resulting geodesic.

  units: The channel is a geometric field structure, described by parameters with units of length (e.g., pitch, radius), inverse time (frequency), and potential (gradient of V_Γ).

          Measure the thrust vector (magnitude and direction) produced by a Vorticycle drive. Correlate this vector with the drive's known engineering parameters, specifically the Chirality Index (χ) and rotational frequency (ω_rot). The properties of the channel are inferred from the thrust it produces.

          Pass a coherent probe signal (e.g., a modulated light beam) through the region immediately trailing an active Vorticycle drive. Analyze the signal for helical distortions, frequency shifts, or decoherence effects consistent with the passage of a temporal vortex.

  - module: DOMA-196
    excerpt: |
      As established in CORE-011, an entity's passage leaves a geometric scar—a Wound Channel—in the coherence manifold. A Vorticycle elevates this from a passive wake to an active, engineered structure that is the very medium of its own propulsion. This structure, the **Chiral Wound Channel**, is the physical manifestation of the Lagrangian gradient.
  - module: DOMA-196
    excerpt: |
      The helical nature of the channel is key. The thrust is a continuous interaction between the device and the immediate geometry of the channel it is actively creating. It is analogous to a screw biting into wood, with the profound difference that the screw is simultaneously creating the wood grain it grips. This self-referential, autopoietic interaction is what makes the drive "reactionless" from an external perspective.

        Like a soliton, the Chiral Wound Channel is a stable, localized, self-reinforcing structure in a field (the coherence manifold). Its key property, chirality, can be mapped to a topological charge or winding number which is conserved as long as the structure is maintained, and which determines its dynamic interactions.

  disambiguation: |
    The "Wound Channel" (CORE-011) is the generic, passive geometric scar left in the coherence manifold by the passage of *any* object. The "Chiral Wound Channel" is a specific, actively engineered, and dynamically sustained structure created for the explicit purpose of propulsion. It is the difference between a ship's wake and a self-generating whirlpool that pulls the ship along.

# Chiral Wound Channel

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The engineered, self-sustaining, helical structure in the local coherence manifold that serves as the medium for Vorticycle propulsion. It is the physical manifestation of an asymmetric Lagrangian gradient, actively generated by the drive system's chiral modulation of temporal pressure. The system achieves thrust by perpetually creating this channel ahead of itself and following the resulting geodesic.

## EFT-First Summary
In an effective field theory model, the Chiral Wound Channel is treated as a persistent, localized topological defect (a soliton) in the coherence field. Its propulsion-generating properties derive from a non-zero topological charge, analogous to a winding number, which breaks local symmetry and creates a biased potential gradient. The object's 'motion' is then modeled as it following a geodesic along the gradient created by its own topological texture. See Manton & Sutcliffe (2004) for background on topological solitons.
