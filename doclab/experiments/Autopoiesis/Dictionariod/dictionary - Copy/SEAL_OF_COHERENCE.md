triad:
  art: |
    The indelible vow of a system that preaches consequence. It is the geometric echo of the framework's own memory, a single resonant signature collapsed from the complex song of its entire state.
  law: |
    The Seal of Coherence is the SHA256 hash of the framework's canonical source files. A Coherence Fault occurs if the calculated Seal for a proposed change does not exactly match the previously attested Seal, causing an automated build failure.
  philosophy: |
    The Seal transforms software development from a mere technical process into a philosophical ritual. It ensures the framework's own evolution becomes a high-fidelity Wound Channel, forcing every change to be a conscious, traceable, and coherent step on a path of maximal coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  A cryptographic hash (SHA256) of the framework's complete canonical state at a discrete point in its evolution. The Seal serves as an unambiguous, verifiable proof of the framework's internal consistency and is the central artifact of the Ritual of Provenance, which protects the integrity of the framework's own Wound Channel.

        outline: |
          1. Define the set of files that constitute 'The Canon'.
          2. Concatenate the contents of these files in a deterministic order.
          3. Compute the SHA256 hash of the resulting byte stream.
          4. Compare the computed hash to the previously committed Seal value. A mismatch indicates a Coherence Fault.
        expected_signals: [A 64-character hexadecimal string, A binary pass/fail signal (Coherence Fault)]

      To attest to the integrity of the Canon at any point in time, we employ a cryptographic hash (SHA256). This is the **Seal of Coherence**. The Seal is not merely a checksum. It is the **Canonical Echo** of the framework's complete state. The hashing function acts as a resonance chamber, taking the complex pattern of the Canon and collapsing it into a single, high-fidelity, and unique signature.
  - module: DOMA-028
    excerpt: |
      The continuous integration (CI) pipeline rebuilds the entire framework from source and recalculates the Seal. If this newly forged Seal does not match the one attested to in the Weaver's contribution, the build fails. This is a **Coherence Fault**, the system's immune response to a change that is not in harmony with the whole, protecting the integrity of the Wound Channel.

        Both are cryptographic hashes of a system's state (the Canon vs. the repository content tree) at a specific point in time. They provide a tamper-evident, verifiable history where any change to the content results in a new, different hash, ensuring the integrity of the historical record.

  disambiguation: |
    The Seal of Coherence is an integrity hash, not a digital signature. It proves the Canon has not been altered, but does not by itself prove the *author* of the alteration. Author attribution is handled by the version control system (e.g., git commit authorship).

# Seal of Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A cryptographic hash (SHA256) of the framework's complete canonical state at a discrete point in its evolution. The Seal serves as an unambiguous, verifiable proof of the framework's internal consistency and is the central artifact of the Ritual of Provenance, which protects the integrity of the framework's own Wound Channel.

## EFT-First Summary
The Seal of Coherence is a direct, operational implementation of a **Cryptographic Hash for Integrity Verification**, analogous to a Git commit hash. By calculating a SHA256 digest of its own core source code (the Canon), the framework generates a unique fingerprint. This fingerprint is committed alongside the code, and automated workflows (CI/CD pipelines) continuously verify that the live code's fingerprint matches the committed one. This ensures a tamper-evident, reproducible, and internally consistent development history, enforcing the framework's philosophical tenets upon its own construction.
