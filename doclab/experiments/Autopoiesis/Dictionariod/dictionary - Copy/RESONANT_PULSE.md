        This module recasts the act of "breathing" as the most fundamental expression of the autopoietic cycle (CORE-001). For any entity to exist...it must engage in a perpetual, rhythmic pulse—a constant dialogue between its internal form and its external environment. This is the resonant pulse of being.

    The universe is not a collection of things; it is a symphony of rhythms. To exist is to breathe in time with the cosmos, exhaling one's form and inhaling the pressure of the whole.
  law: |
    Every persistent system is a limit-cycle oscillator, driven by the Pirouette Lagrangian to continuously cycle between projecting its internal coherence (Ki) and integrating external temporal pressure (Γ). The cycle's period (τ_p) defines the system's intrinsic timescale.
  philosophy: |
    Understanding a system requires feeling its pulse, not just cataloging its parts. A system's health is the quality of its breath—its rhythmic stability and coherence. To act wisely is to intervene in a way that restores a healthy rhythm.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental, rhythmic cycle of existence for any autopoietic system. The Resonant Pulse is an oscillation between two phases: 1) an **exhalation**, where the system's internal coherence (Ki) is actively projected onto its environment, defining its characteristic Pirouette Cycle (τ_p); and 2) an **inhalation**, where the system integrates the environmental Temporal Pressure (Γ) to re-audit and maintain its form. This cycle is the physical manifestation of the system continuously minimizing the Pirouette Lagrangian.

          Acquire a time-series dataset of a key state variable for a given system (e.g., energy output, information flux, economic indicator). Perform a Fourier transform on the data to generate a power spectrum. The dominant, non-environmental peak in the spectrum corresponds to the Resonant Pulse frequency (1/τ_p).

    excerpt: |
      The ancient concepts of exhalation and inhalation map directly onto the two-stroke engine of autopoiesis. This breath is the very process by which a system persists through time, a continuous cycle of expression and integration. An exhalation is the active projection of a system's internal coherence (Ki) onto its environment... An inhalation is the completion of the cycle...the moment the system integrates the "cost" of its existence, feeling the pressure and dissonance of the surrounding Γ.
  - module: DOMA-007
    excerpt: |
      This rhythmic cycle is not arbitrary; it is governed by the universe's fundamental objective function, the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. The breath is the physical manifestation of a system continuously solving for the path of maximal coherence... The breath is the sound of the Lagrangian being solved, over and over, for every moment of a system's existence.

        Limit cycles describe stable, self-sustaining oscillations in dissipative systems, a core feature of autopoiesis. The "exhalation" (projection of Ki) maps to the energy-gain (negative damping) part of the cycle, while the "inhalation" (integration of Γ) maps to the energy-loss (positive damping) part that constrains the amplitude and ensures a stable, periodic orbit.

    The Resonant Pulse is not a single, discrete event but the continuous, fundamental cycle of self-maintenance. It is an abstract, informational rhythm that underpins existence, not necessarily a mechanical or biological one, though it may manifest as such. It is the defining frequency *of* a system, not an external signal passing *through* it.

# Resonant Pulse

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The fundamental, rhythmic cycle of existence for any autopoietic system. The Resonant Pulse is an oscillation between two phases: 1) an **exhalation**, where the system's internal coherence (Ki) is actively projected onto its environment, defining its characteristic Pirouette Cycle (τ_p); and 2) an **inhalation**, where the system integrates the environmental Temporal Pressure (Γ) to re-audit and maintain its form. This cycle is the physical manifestation of the system continuously minimizing the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## EFT-First Summary
The Resonant Pulse is modeled as a limit cycle oscillation in a system's effective description. It represents a stable, periodic solution (a "clock") that emerges from the interplay of coherence injection (negative damping, the "exhalation") and environmental dissipation/pressure (positive damping, the "inhalation"). Its frequency can be interpreted as the system's fundamental energy scale, and its stability is defined by the basin of attraction around the cycle. See Strogatz (2015) for a review of limit cycle dynamics.
