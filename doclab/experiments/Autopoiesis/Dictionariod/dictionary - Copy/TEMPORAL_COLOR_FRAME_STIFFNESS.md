  art: |
    Stiffness sets the strings, coherence sets the drum skin, and out comes the fundamental tone of confinement. It is the silent rigidity of the vacuum's fabric, against which the vibrant music of the strong force is played.
  law: |
    The fundamental string tension (σ) is directly proportional to the frame stiffness (κ₃) and inversely proportional to the square of the Γ-coherence length (ξ_Γ), via the relation σ = c_σ (κ₃ / ξ_Γ²). The normalization constant c_σ is fixed once by a single benchmark observable, rendering all subsequent predictions deterministic.
  philosophy: |
    This term is the primary mechanical knob controlling the strength of nonperturbative confinement. It bridges the perturbative regime (via its link to g_s) to the entire hadronic spectrum (via σ), making it the central engine that converts a field-theoretic coupling into a physical force. It reifies the abstract coupling constant into a tangible property of the vacuum frame.
pirouette_definition: |
  An effective, dimensionless elastic modulus of the temporal-color frame, representing the frame's resistance to deformation by color-electric flux. It is proportional to the inverse squared running coupling (1/g_s²(μ)) at a characteristic matching scale μ*, after a one-time normalization. As the numerator in the core scaling relation for string tension (σ), κ₃ directly sets the overall strength of the linear confining potential and, by extension, the mass scale of hadrons.

          1. Measure the static heavy quark-antiquark potential V(R) using Wilson loops in a lattice QCD simulation.
          2. Extract the fundamental string tension (σ) from the slope of the potential in the linear, long-distance regime (V(R) ≈ σR).
          3. Independently determine the Γ-coherence length (ξ_Γ) from Bridge module calculations (e.g., from ω_c, χ).
          4. Invert the core scaling relation to find the stiffness: κ₃ = (σ_measured * ξ_Γ²) / c_σ. The normalization constant c_σ is fixed once for all calculations using a single, high-precision measurement of σ.

      Provide a deterministic pipeline that converts Pirouette’s mechanical parameters—temporal-color frame stiffness (κ₃) and Γ-coherence length (ξ_Γ)—into nonperturbative QCD outputs. This closes the loop between the coherence barrier and hadronic phenomenology.

      Baseline confinement scaling:
      [σ = c_σ (κ₃/ξ_Γ²) [1+δ_np]].
      The normalization convention is to choose a single empirical anchor (e.g., σ¹ᐟ² ≃ 440 MeV) once, thereby fixing c_σ for all subsequent predictions. After that, there is no tuning—only Pirouette inputs vary.

        Stress = E × Strain
      justification: |
        κ₃ functions as an effective elastic modulus for the chromoelectric flux tube (string). In solid mechanics, Young's modulus relates stress (force/area) to strain (deformation); here, κ₃ is the core parameter that determines the vacuum's ability to support the stress manifest as string tension.

  adopted:
    - target: Kinetic term prefactor `1/g²`
      rationale: |
        This is the direct mathematical origin of the term within the framework. κ₃ is explicitly defined as a normalized, effective version of the bare frame stiffness `K₃ ≡ 1/g_s²`, which is the prefactor of the Yang-Mills Lagrangian `(1/2g²) Tr[F²]`. This prefactor controls the 'stiffness' of the gauge field against fluctuations, and its running determines the emergence of nonperturbative scales.

# Temporal-color frame stiffness

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An effective, dimensionless elastic modulus of the temporal-color frame, representing the frame's resistance to deformation by color-electric flux. It is proportional to the inverse squared running coupling (1/g_s²(μ)) at a characteristic matching scale μ*, after a one-time normalization. As the numerator in the core scaling relation for string tension (σ), κ₃ directly sets the overall strength of the linear confining potential and, by extension, the mass scale of hadrons.

## EFT-First Summary
The temporal-color frame stiffness, κ₃, is the Pirouette Framework's effective, nonperturbative analogue of the prefactor `1/g_s²` in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian. This term controls the rigidity of the gauge field against fluctuations. Its magnitude, combined with the Γ-coherence length, deterministically sets the fundamental string tension σ, which is the primary low-energy observable of confinement in QCD. Thus, κ₃ provides the direct, mechanistic link from the perturbative running coupling to the entire nonperturbative hadronic spectrum.
