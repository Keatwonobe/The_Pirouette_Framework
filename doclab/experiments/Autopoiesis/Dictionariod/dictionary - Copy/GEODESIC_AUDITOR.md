        Provides a universal diagnostic protocol that inverts the principle of observation. Instead of searching for faint signals of pathology, it quantifies a system's deviation from its ideal path of maximal coherence (its geodesic). The resulting 'Coherence Audit Map' reveals turbulence, stagnation, and decay as clear, high-contrast signals, diagnosing not just failure, but the precursors to it.

    A healthy system sings a clear, predictable song. The Auditor does not learn the chaotic language of every disease; it knows the song of health so perfectly that any beat of silence where a note should be rings out like a thunderclap.
  law: |
    Systemic pathology is quantified not by the presence of a fault signature, but by the magnitude of the deviation (`Œîùìõ`) between the system's actual Lagrangian state (`ùìõ_p(actual)`) and its ideal geodesic blueprint (`ùìõ_p(expected)`). `Œîùìõ = |ùìõ_p(expected) - ùìõ_p(actual)|`.
  philosophy: |
    A fault is not a flaw in the machine; it is the map of the machine's own pain. To audit a system is to ask, with compassion and precision, "Where does it hurt?" And in the answer, we find the beginning of the cure.
pirouette_definition: |
  An instrument or process that diagnoses systemic pathology by inverting the principle of detection. It forges a `GeodesicBlueprint` representing the system's ideal state of maximal coherence (its geodesic path). The Auditor then continuously measures the system's actual state and computes the `Deviation Field (Œîùìõ)`‚Äîthe difference between the ideal and the actual. The resulting `Coherence Audit Map` provides a direct, quantitative visualization of systemic stress, revealing turbulence, stagnation, and decay as high-contrast signals.

        outline: |
          1.  **Define Geodesic:** Load or generate the `GeodesicBlueprint` (`ùìõ_p(expected)`) from first principles, historical data, or simulation.
          2.  **Ingest Stream:** Connect to the real-time data stream representing the system's observed state (`ùìõ_p(actual)`).
          3.  **Compute Deviation Field:** Continuously calculate the scalar field `Œîùìõ = |ùìõ_p(expected) - ùìõ_p(actual)|`.
          4.  **Identify Loci:** Flag all regions where `Œîùìõ` exceeds the `FaultThreshold (Œ¥)`.
          5.  **Classify & Map:** Classify the pathology of each locus (e.g., turbulence, stagnation) and generate a Coherence Audit Map.
        expected_signals: [Coherence Audit Map, spatiotemporal fault loci, classified pathology signatures (Fever, Atrophy, Erosion)]
        pitfalls: [Inaccurate or outdated `GeodesicBlueprint` leading to false positives/negatives; high noise in the `ActualStream` obscuring the true deviation signal.]
context_windows:
  - module: DOMA-172
    excerpt: |
      The most efficient way to find a flaw is not to search for the flaw itself, but to search for the absence of perfection. Instead of searching for a specific "fault" signature within a noisy system, we define the signature of health and measure everything that is *not that*. This is the principle of diagnosis by exception, or the Null Template.
  - module: DOMA-172
    excerpt: |
      The Auditor measures not just error, but the *metabolic cost* of that error, turning abstract mathematics into a tangible diagnostic tool. By analyzing the components of `Œîùìõ`, a Weaver can determine *why* the system is deviating: Is it suffering from internal dissonance (a drop in **Temporal Coherence, KœÑ**)? Or buckling under external stress (an unmanaged spike in **Temporal Pressure, V_Œì**)?
  - module: DOMA-172
    excerpt: |
      The output of the Auditor is not just a map of "faults"; it is a direct diagnosis of systemic pathology. The geometry of the dissonance, read through the `Caduceus Lens` (DYNA-003), reveals its nature: **Coherence Fever (Turbulence)**... **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnation)**... **Coherence Erosion (Decay)**...

        The Geodesic Auditor calculates the residual (`Œîùìõ`) between an ideal model (`GeodesicBlueprint`) and an observed signal (`ActualStream`). This residual field is then analyzed for statistically significant deviations (fault loci), which is the core method of residual analysis for anomaly detection and model validation in classical statistics and control systems.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a financial or security auditor which checks for compliance against a set of rules, the Geodesic Auditor measures deviation from a *dynamical ideal* (a geodesic). Its function is diagnostic and physical, not forensic or regulatory. It is concerned with systemic health and efficiency, not adherence to static standards.

# Geodesic Auditor

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An instrument or process that diagnoses systemic pathology by inverting the principle of detection. It forges a `GeodesicBlueprint` representing the system's ideal state of maximal coherence (its geodesic path). The Auditor then continuously measures the system's actual state and computes the `Deviation Field (Œîùìõ)`‚Äîthe difference between the ideal and the actual. The resulting `Coherence Audit Map` provides a direct, quantitative visualization of systemic stress, revealing turbulence, stagnation, and decay as high-contrast signals.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of classical statistics and control theory, the Geodesic Auditor implements **Residual Analysis**. It defines a system's ideal behavior as a predictive model (`GeodesicBlueprint`) and treats its real-time state as an observation. The "Coherence Audit Map" is a spatiotemporal plot of the residuals‚Äîthe difference between observation and prediction. Pathologies are identified as statistically significant, structured patterns in this residual field, analogous to how residual analysis detects model misspecification or anomalies in data.
