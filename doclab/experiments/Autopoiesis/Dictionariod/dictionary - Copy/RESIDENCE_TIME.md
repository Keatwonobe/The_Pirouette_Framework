  law: |
    To uniquely minimise Residue R via Algorithm B₁, the integration period T_{res} must be at least twice the dominant fluctuation period (τ_{dominant}) of the entropy flux ∇S.
  philosophy: |
    By deliberately blurring high-frequency events, one can discern the stable, underlying currents of a system. T_{res} operationalises the principle that meaningful structure is revealed not by instantaneous snapshots, but by patient observation over a characteristic timescale.
pirouette_definition: |
  Residence Time (T_{res}) is the temporal integration window over which entropy flux (∇S) is averaged when calculating Residue (R). It functions as a low-pass filter, ensuring that the selection of a minimal-Residue boundary (∂Ωₜ) is determined by persistent, low-frequency dynamics rather than transient, high-frequency fluctuations. The minimum effective T_{res} is constrained by the system's dominant fluctuation period (τ_{dominant}).

        In statistical mechanics, microscopic fluctuations are averaged over a time scale (a form of coarse-graining) to derive macroscopic thermodynamic properties. T_{res} plays an analogous role by averaging out high-frequency entropy fluctuations to reveal the persistent, "macroscopic" structure of the system's boundary.

        The constraint T_{res} ≥ 2τ_{dominant} is functionally equivalent to setting the time constant of a low-pass filter to be much larger than the period of high-frequency noise one wishes to attenuate. This is a direct, operational, and mathematically simple analogy for isolating a DC or slowly-varying signal from noise.

# Residence Time

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Residence Time (T_{res}) is the temporal integration window over which entropy flux (∇S) is averaged when calculating Residue (R). It functions as a low-pass filter, ensuring that the selection of a minimal-Residue boundary (∂Ωₜ) is determined by persistent, low-frequency dynamics rather than transient, high-frequency fluctuations. The minimum effective T_{res} is constrained by the system's dominant fluctuation period (τ_{dominant}).

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, Residence Time (T_{res}) acts as the time constant of a low-pass filter. To isolate a system's persistent dynamics (the 'zero-mode'), one integrates over a period T_{res} sufficient to average out high-frequency fluctuations, analogous to how a lock-in amplifier rejects noise to measure a weak DC or low-frequency signal. This filtering is a prerequisite for defining stable system boundaries and conserved charges.
