  art: |
    The eddy currents of dissent, where social energy spins in place. It neither builds nor breaks but merely circulates its own strife, a vortex of locked-in conflict.
  law: |
    The net circulation of social dissonance (∮ **D**⋅d**l**) around a closed loop quantifies the total antagonistic potential enclosed; this value must exceed a substrate-dependent threshold (Θ) to trigger systemic cascades.
  philosophy: |
    This term isolates the geometry of unproductive conflict, distinguishing it from potential-driven inequality (φ). Antagonistic Circulation reveals where a system's energy is trapped in self-reinforcing cycles, preventing coherent forward motion and signaling a precursor to turbulent collapse.
pirouette_definition: |
  Antagonistic Circulation, denoted **A**, is the curl component of the Social Dissonance Field (**D**), isolated via Hodge decomposition of the residual social flow (**r** = **J**<sub>obs</sub> - **J**<sub>opt</sub>). It represents non-conservative, circulatory social dynamics that dissipate energy without contributing to coherent system-wide potential. Operationally, it manifests as self-sustaining factionalism, protest-counterprotest loops, and informational echo chambers.

        outline: |
          1. Construct a weighted, directed graph representing the social system (nodes: agents/groups, edges: interactions).
          2. Compute the coherence-optimal flow (**J**<sub>opt</sub>) by maximizing the Pirouette Lagrangian for the system.
          3. Measure the observed flow (**J**<sub>obs</sub>) from empirical data.
          4. Calculate the residual flow field **r** = **J**<sub>obs</sub> - **J**<sub>opt</sub> on the graph edges.
          5. Apply Hodge decomposition to **r** to isolate the curl component, which is ∇ × **A**.
        expected_signals: [High curl magnitude in localized graph regions, sharp increase in loop integral (∮ **D**⋅d**l**) prior to cascade events]
        pitfalls: [Subjectivity in graph construction, computational cost of calculating **J**<sub>opt</sub>, noise in **J**<sub>obs</sub> data obscuring the signal]

    excerpt: |
      The Social Dissonance Field measures the difference between the real and idealized fluxes: **D** = ∇φ + ∇ × **A**, where φ captures unbalanced cooperative potential (gradient term), and **A** captures antagonistic or circulatory motion (curl term). The Hodge decomposition of the residual flow isolates these components, allowing for independent measurement.
  - module: SOCIO-FIELD-001
    excerpt: |
      The curl magnitude of the dissonance field is predicted to exceed a threshold (Θ) prior to systemic cascade events. The primary measurement is the loop integral, ∮ **D**⋅d**l**. Identifying cascade onset when this integral surpasses Θ is the basis of the Halo Test.

    - target: Magnetic Vector Potential (**A**)

      mapping_kind: mathematical
      equation_hint: |
        **B** = ∇ × **A**  (Magnetism)
        (∇ × **A**) ⊂ **D** (Pirouette)
      justification: |
        The mathematical relationship is identical: a vector potential (**A**) whose curl defines a circulatory field. In electromagnetism, the curl is the magnetic field **B**. In Pirouette, the curl of the social **A** is the circulatory component of dissonance, representing trapped social "momentum" analogous to how a magnetic field stores energy in its circulation.

  claims:
    - statement: "The magnitude of the curl component of dissonance (quantified by ∮ **D**⋅d**l**) rises above a stable baseline and exceeds a critical threshold (Θ) before the onset of systemic social cascades."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "No statistically significant correlation is found between the loop integral and the timing of documented cascade events (e.g., market crashes, civil unrest) across multiple independent social systems."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [**A** is a common symbol for area, amplitude, and the magnetic vector potential.]
  disambiguation: |
    Within Pirouette, **A** refers specifically to the curl-field potential of the Social Dissonance field, not a fundamental physical field. It is always derived from a residual flow on a social graph. Contrast with φ, the gradient-field potential representing cooperative deficits.
