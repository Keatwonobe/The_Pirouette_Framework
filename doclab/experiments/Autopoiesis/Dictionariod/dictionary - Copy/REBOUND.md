        Rebound is the universe's answer to collapse. In the high-pressure, chaotic aftermath of a Fracture or a long Drift, new possibilities for order emerge. Rebound is the process by which a new, stable `Ki` pattern‚Äîa "seed of coherence"‚Äînucleates.

  art: |
    From the ashes of collapse, a new river carves its course. The universe's answer to chaos is not silence, but a more resilient song.
  law: |
    Following decoherence via Fracture or Drift, a system undergoes Rebound if and only if a new coherent state (`Ki`) can nucleate, establishing a positive Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p > 0`) and carving a new geodesic of maximal coherence.
  philosophy: |
    Rebound reframes collapse not as an end-state, but as a necessary precondition for radical adaptation. It asserts that true resilience is not the ability to resist change (Lock), but the capacity to be reborn from it, stronger and better adapted to the new environment.
pirouette_definition: |
  The process of systemic renewal following a collapse (Fracture) or dissolution (Drift). In a high-pressure, chaotic environment, Rebound occurs when fragments of a prior system or new elements nucleate a "seed of coherence"‚Äîa stable `Ki` pattern‚Äîthrough processes like Alchemical Union. This new seed carves a new geodesic of maximal coherence, establishing a new, often more resilient, order.

      justification: |
        Rebound describes the formation of a stable "seed" of order in a chaotic, high-energy environment, analogous to how a crystal nucleus forms in a supersaturated solution. The "cost" of forming the new interface (`V_Œì`) is overcome by the "gain" in bulk stability (`K_œÑ`). The Pirouette Lagrangian `ùìõ_p` plays a role analogous to the negative Gibbs free energy change.

# Rebound

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The process of systemic renewal following a collapse (Fracture) or dissolution (Drift). In a high-pressure, chaotic environment, Rebound occurs when fragments of a prior system or new elements nucleate a "seed of coherence"‚Äîa stable `Ki` pattern‚Äîthrough processes like Alchemical Union. This new seed carves a new geodesic of maximal coherence, establishing a new, often more resilient, order.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Rebound maps to nucleation phenomena in statistical mechanics and condensed matter. It models the spontaneous formation of a new, stable phase (a coherent system) from a disordered, high-energy state (the post-collapse environment). This process is driven by a competition between the energetic cost of a new boundary (related to `V_Œì`) and the stability gain of the new bulk phase (related to `K_œÑ`), where the Pirouette Lagrangian `ùìõ_p` acts analogously to the driving potential for phase transition.
