    When quarks hum together, their shared rhythm cancels the loudest parts of the song; only a faint overtone—the Γ whisper—escapes the hadron's confinement.
  law: |
    The anomalous magnetic moment correction for a baryon B scales as Δa_B = η_B * (g_Γ² / 8π²) * (M_B / m_Γ)², where η_B is a small, baryon-specific factor (∼10⁻⁵ for protons) representing QCD screening effects.
  philosophy: |
    Represents the principle that fundamental interactions are modulated by the emergent structure of the systems they act upon. It bridges the elementary Γ-lepton coupling to the complex, coherent world of QCD, demonstrating how confinement silences some forces while allowing faint, structured whispers to persist.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dimensionless factor, η_B, that quantifies the net Γ-field coupling strength to a composite baryon (like a proton or neutron). It represents a strong suppression of the fundamental Γ-quark interaction due to gluon coherence and phase cancellation among the constituent quarks. This screening effect reduces the observable impact of the Γ-field on hadronic properties, such as the anomalous magnetic moment, by several orders of magnitude.

        outline: |
          Precisely measure the anomalous magnetic moment `a_B` of a baryon (e.g., proton). Subtract the predicted Standard Model (QED/QCD) value. If a residual `Δa_B` exists and scales with `M_B²` as predicted, `η_B` can be extracted using the relation `η_B = Δa_B * (8π² / g_Γ²) * (m_Γ / M_B)²`.
        expected_signals: [A residual anomaly Δa_p ~ 10⁻¹⁰ for the proton or Δa_n ~ 10⁻¹¹ for the neutron.]
        pitfalls: [Current experimental precision (~10⁻⁸) is insufficient to resolve the signal. Other beyond-Standard-Model physics could contribute to the anomaly, requiring cross-validation.]

    excerpt: |
      Inside a baryon, Γ excitation manifests as a **beat pattern** between quark temporal phases. The coherence gradient of these beats defines η_B. When baryons interact coherently (as in dense matter), Γ coupling enhances proportionally to local phase alignment, providing a natural link to nuclear binding corrections later explored in DYNA-Γ-NUC.

# Effective Baryonic Coupling Constant

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A dimensionless factor, η_B, that quantifies the net Γ-field coupling strength to a composite baryon (like a proton or neutron). It represents a strong suppression of the fundamental Γ-quark interaction due to gluon coherence and phase cancellation among the constituent quarks. This screening effect reduces the observable impact of the Γ-field on hadronic properties, such as the anomalous magnetic moment, by several orders of magnitude.

## EFT-First Summary
In an Effective Field Theory context, `η_B` acts as a non-perturbative form factor that suppresses the coupling of the Γ-field to baryons. It encapsulates the complex QCD dynamics within the hadron, effectively 'dressing' the fundamental Γ-quark vertex. This results in a predicted correction to the baryon magnetic moment anomaly (`Δa_B`) that is currently below experimental limits but falsifiable with next-generation measurements.
