    Local gauge freedom is the right to reset your clock’s zero—everywhere, everywhen. The photon is the universe’s courier ensuring those resets remain consistent: a shear wave that carries the memo from one tick of time to the next.
  law: |
    The requirement that physics be invariant under local, point-wise relabeling of the temporal clock phase `θ(x) → θ(x) + α(x)` mandates the existence of a massless vector field `Aμ` (the photon) with Maxwell dynamics. Any observed vacuum photon dispersion or non-universality of electric charge would falsify this principle.
  philosophy: |
    This principle reframes QED's U(1) gauge symmetry from a fundamental, axiomatic input to an emergent property of a time-first substrate. It provides a physical mechanism for the existence of light and charge, rooting them in the kinematic freedom of a "temporal ocean" rather than in abstract symmetry principles.
pirouette_definition: |
  The principle that the U(1) gauge symmetry of quantum electrodynamics is an emergent consequence of the freedom to locally and independently relabel the zero-point of the temporal clock phase, `θ(x)`. This local relabeling invariance necessitates the introduction of a compensating connection field, `Aμ`, which is identified with the electromagnetic four-potential. The dynamics of this connection (its "stiffness") give rise to the Maxwell Lagrangian, and its quanta are shear waves in the temporal medium, identified as photons.

        outline: |
          Measure the arrival times of photons with different energies originating from a single, distant, transient astrophysical event (e.g., a Gamma-Ray Burst or fast radio burst). A difference in arrival time correlated with energy, after correcting for known plasma effects in the interstellar medium, would indicate a frequency-dependent speed of light.
        expected_signals: [Coincident arrival times for all photons, implying the speed of light `c` is constant across all frequencies.]

        outline: |
          Perform high-precision measurements of the electric charges of different fundamental particles (e.g., electron, muon, proton). This principle requires their fundamental charges to be exact integer multiples of a single value `q` (which becomes `e/3`).

      When spatial/temporal gradients of the local clock calibration are costly, the effective action acquires a curvature penalty for the connection: [ L_EM = -1/4 F_μν F^μν ].

It recasts the abstract phase transformation of a charged field's wavefunction as a concrete relabeling of a background temporal clock phase.

# Time-Phase Gauge Principle

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The principle that the U(1) gauge symmetry of quantum electrodynamics is an emergent consequence of the freedom to locally and independently relabel the zero-point of the temporal clock phase, `θ(x)`. This local relabeling invariance necessitates the introduction of a compensating connection field, `Aμ`, which is identified with the electromagnetic four-potential. The dynamics of this connection (its "stiffness") give rise to the Maxwell Lagrangian, and its quanta are shear waves in the temporal medium, identified as photons.

## EFT-First Summary
The Time-Phase Gauge Principle is a proposed physical origin for the U(1) gauge symmetry of the Standard Model's electromagnetic sector. It models the universe as a substrate with a local clock phase `θ(x)`. The freedom to relabel this phase locally (`θ → θ + α(x)`) is a gauge freedom that requires a connection field `Aμ` to maintain derivative covariance. This field is identified as the photon, and its lowest-order dynamics are governed by the Maxwell term `-1/4 FμνFμν`, which emerges as a stiffness term penalizing gradients in the local phase calibration. This provides a constructive explanation for the existence of the photon and the principle of local gauge invariance in QED (see, e.g., Peskin & Schroeder, *An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*, 1995).
