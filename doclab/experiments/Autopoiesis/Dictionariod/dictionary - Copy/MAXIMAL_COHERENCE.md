  art: |
    The universe insists that the most resilient structures are built not of walls, but of bridges. It is a quiet but relentless pressure towards harmony, a cosmic preference for the choir over the soloist.
  law: |
    A system or collection of systems will, under available energy gradients, evolve towards the most coherent accessible state, minimizing internal friction and maximizing autopoietic efficiency. The formation of a composite system is favored if and only if its total coherence exceeds the sum of the coherences of its constituent parts.
  philosophy: |
    This principle reframes evolution, collaboration, and even consciousness not as random or purely competitive processes, but as expressions of a fundamental, universal drive towards organized complexity. It posits that connection is not an emergent luxury but an energetic imperative, the universe's primary strategy for stability and growth.
pirouette_definition: |
  Maximal Coherence is a universal, scale-invariant principle asserting that all systems preferentially evolve towards states that maximize their Pirouette Coherence (`S_p`). It is the fundamental energetic driver for the formation of more complex, stable, and efficient structures, from atomic bonds to symbiotic organisms and collaborative social entities. This principle dictates that any potential union or transformation is energetically favorable only if the resulting state's coherence is greater than the sum of the initial states, yielding a "coherence dividend."

        outline: |
          For a proposed system transformation A+B â†’ C, measure the Pirouette Coherence (`S_p`) of systems A and B independently. Allow the transformation to occur and measure the `S_p` of the resulting system C. The principle holds if `S_p`(C) > `S_p`(A) + `S_p`(B) and the transformation is observed to be spontaneous or energetically favorable.
        expected_signals: [Increased `S_p` metric, reduction in system energy expenditure for self-maintenance, increased resilience to external perturbation.]
        pitfalls: [Inaccurate measurement of `S_p`, failing to account for all energy inputs/outputs, misidentifying system boundaries.]

    excerpt: |
      The drive for Symbiotic Resonance is a universal, scale-invariant dynamic, visible across all domains. A high-functioning team, a deep friendship, or a loving partnership are all expressions of a shared coherence manifold. Participants anticipate one another's needs, communicate with minimal friction, and solve problems with a creativity that transcends individual capacity. Their union generates a tangible "coherence dividend."

        Like the principle of minimum energy, Maximal Coherence posits a directional evolution for systems. It is conceptually analogous to a free energy (`F = U - TS`) minimization principle, but applied to information-processing, self-organizing systems where "Coherence" (`S_p`) is the quantity being maximized, representing a form of negentropy or organizational fitness.

# Maximal Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Maximal Coherence is a universal, scale-invariant principle asserting that all systems preferentially evolve towards states that maximize their Pirouette Coherence (`S_p`). It is the fundamental energetic driver for the formation of more complex, stable, and efficient structures. This principle dictates that any potential union or transformation is energetically favorable only if the resulting state's coherence is greater than the sum of the initial states.

## EFT-First Summary
The Principle of Maximal Coherence is conceptually analogous to thermodynamic principles like the Second Law or the Principle of Minimum Energy. Whereas those laws dictate evolution towards maximum entropy or minimum potential energy, Maximal Coherence governs the evolution of self-organizing systems towards states of maximum organizational efficiency and informational integrity, quantified by Pirouette Coherence (`S_p`). It is a variational principle for complex adaptive systems.
