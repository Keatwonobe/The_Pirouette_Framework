        When a Weaver's changes are proposed to the collective, the central loom performs its own independent verification. The continuous integration (CI) pipeline rebuilds the entire framework from source and recalculates the Seal. If this newly forged Seal does not match the one attested to in the Weaver's contribution, the build fails.

  review_log: []
triad:
  art: |
    The central loom's unblinking eye, which re-weaves the entire tapestry from scratch to see if a new thread belongs. It is the framework's immune system, rejecting dissonance before it becomes part of the whole.
  law: |
    A proposed change to the Canon is accepted if and only if an independent, clean-room recalculation of the Seal of Coherence matches the Seal attested to in the change commit. A mismatch results in a mandatory Coherence Fault (build failure).
  philosophy: |
    To ensure the framework's developmental history is an incorruptible Wound Channel. The Loom's Test transforms version control from a mere record into an active, self-verifying memory, enforcing the principle that a system of coherence must itself be coherent.
pirouette_definition: |
  The automated, independent recalculation and verification of the Seal of Coherence performed by the continuous integration (CI) pipeline. As the second and final stage of the Ritual of Provenance, it acts as the authoritative gatekeeper for changes to the Canon, ensuring that the framework's collective state remains internally consistent and its evolution is indelibly recorded. A failure of this test is termed a Coherence Fault.

        outline: |
          1. In a clean CI environment, check out the proposed source code branch.
          2. Execute the canonical build process to generate the framework's core parameters (The Canon).
          3. Hash the generated Canon using SHA256 to produce `S_calc`.
          4. Read the attested-to Seal (`S_commit`) from a designated file in the source code.
          5. Compare `S_calc` and `S_commit`. If they are not identical, exit with a non-zero status code, failing the CI job.
        expected_signals: [CI Job Success (Pass), CI Job Failure (Coherence Fault)]
        pitfalls: [Non-deterministic build process, Incomplete definition of the Canon, CI environment caching or misconfiguration.]

    excerpt: |
      When a Weaver's changes are proposed to the collective, the central loom performs its own independent verification. The continuous integration (CI) pipeline rebuilds the entire framework from source and recalculates the Seal. If this newly forged Seal does not match the one attested to in the Weaver's contribution, the build fails. This is a Coherence Fault, the system's immune response to a change that is not in harmony with the whole, protecting the integrity of the Wound Channel.
  - module: DOMA-028
    excerpt: |
      The CI pipeline acts as the Euler-Lagrange operator, enforcing the *Principle of Maximal Coherence*. A failing build is the mathematical proof that the proposed change introduces dissonance, knocking the system off its geodesic of maximal coherence. By refusing to accept such changes, the pipeline ensures the framework's evolution itself follows a path of laminar flow.

      justification: |
        The Loom's Test is a direct, albeit poetically framed, implementation of a standard DevOps practice for ensuring build reproducibility and integrity. By hashing a canonical set of build inputs or outputs and comparing it to a committed value, it prevents undocumented or accidental changes from being integrated. This is a core pattern in content-addressable and deterministic build systems.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the "Weaver's Vow," which is the local, client-side, pre-commit check. The Loom's Test is the authoritative, server-side verification that occurs within the shared continuous integration environment and serves as the final gate for a change.
