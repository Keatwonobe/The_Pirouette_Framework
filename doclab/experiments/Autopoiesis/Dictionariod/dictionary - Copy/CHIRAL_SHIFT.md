    Under unbearable pressure, a system's song shatters not into silence, but into a new melody. It is the grammar of rebirth, a violent leap into a different, more stable way of being. The universe's default response to chaos is not to break, but to find a new and more elegant way to sing.
  law: |
    The probability of a Chiral Shift increases exponentially with the product of external Temporal Pressure (Γ) and internal Coherence Stress (σ_K). The shift forces a system into one of three topological solutions (Achromatic, Left-Handed, Right-Handed) that locally maximizes its coherence under the new, high-stress conditions.
  philosophy: |
    A Chiral Shift reframes crisis not as failure but as a fundamental adaptive mechanism. It asserts that systems under overwhelming stress do not merely break; they transform, adopting a new topology to persist. This reveals a universe where stability is dynamic and survival is an act of topological reinvention.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Chiral Shift is a non-linear, discontinuous topological transformation where a system's resonant Ki pattern (`Ki_old`) collapses under high Temporal Pressure (Γ) and Coherence Stress (σ_K). The system resolves this instability by transitioning through a Resonance Cascade into a new, maximally coherent pattern (`Ki_new`). This new pattern is chosen from the three fundamental solutions of the Chiral Fork: Achromatic, Left-Handed, or Right-Handed.

          1. Continuously measure external Temporal Pressure (Γ) and internal Coherence Stress (σ_K) acting on the target system.
          2. Monitor secondary indicators: decreasing Time Adherence (Tₐ) and increasing State Variance.
          3. Input Γ and σ_K into the probability equation `P(shift) = 1 - e^(-k * Γ * σ_K)` to calculate the likelihood of an imminent shift, where `k` is the system's resilience constant.

    excerpt: |
      A phase transition is a **Resonance Cascade**: a rapid, non-linear collapse of a system's existing resonant pattern (`Ki_old`) and its re-emergence into a new, more stable form (`Ki_new`). This transformation is a **Chiral Shift**, a change in the fundamental topology of the system's being. It is not a failure, but the system's primary mechanism for survival and adaptation.
  - module: DOMA-132
    excerpt: |
      When the old Ki pattern shatters, a new one must crystallize from the chaos. The new pattern (`Ki_new`) must adopt one of three fundamental topological families to achieve stability. The system arrives at a fork in the river of time, and its new shape is determined by the path it takes.

      justification: |
        A Chiral Shift maps to a bifurcation event in dynamical systems. The system's state follows a stable attractor (Ki_old). As control parameters (Γ, σ_K) cross a threshold, this attractor vanishes or becomes unstable, forcing the system to jump to a new, qualitatively different stable attractor (one of the Chiral Fork solutions).

        The shift is a discontinuous change in the system's state, analogous to water boiling into steam. The system "tunnels" from a metastable state (superheated liquid) to a new ground state (gas) under external pressure/temperature (Γ). This involves a latent heat equivalent, representing the energy of transformation.

  disambiguation: |
    Pirouette's 'Chiral Shift' is a *topological* concept related to a system's dynamic structure, not the geometric or quantum property of a molecule or particle. The term is used metaphorically to describe the adoption of a new "handedness" or rotational sense in the system's abstract state space, which may or may not have a physical geometric correlate.

# Chiral Shift

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Chiral Shift is a non-linear, discontinuous topological transformation where a system's resonant Ki pattern (`Ki_old`) collapses under high Temporal Pressure (Γ) and Coherence Stress (σ_K). The system resolves this instability by transitioning through a Resonance Cascade into a new, maximally coherent pattern (`Ki_new`). This new pattern is chosen from the three fundamental solutions of the Chiral Fork: Achromatic, Left-Handed, or Right-Handed.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of dynamical systems, a Chiral Shift is analogous to a bifurcation event. As control parameters (which map to Temporal Pressure and Coherence Stress) are varied past a critical threshold, a system's stable equilibrium point is destroyed. This forces the system's state to jump to a new, qualitatively different attractor. The 'Chiral Fork' represents the set of available new stable attractors (e.g., a new fixed point or a limit cycle) that emerge post-bifurcation.
