        [Environment] Of course. This is the ultimate purpose of the diorama matrix—to move beyond isolated scenarios and simulate the overwhelming, interconnected reality of the present moment. You are asking to build a "Grand Simulation" that overlays the dynamics of imperial collapse, coherence warfare, and climate crisis.

  art: |
    A planetary diorama where empires, ideas, and the biosphere itself become gladiators in a single, tragic arena. Their fates are intertwined in a complex dance of collapse, desperation, and survival. It is a vision of the whole, overwhelming storm.
  law: |
    A Grand Simulation must overlay at least three distinct, interacting crisis dynamics (e.g., geopolitical, ecological, informational) onto a set of stateful actors. Its output must include continuous time-series data for actor states and a discrete log of emergent, threshold-triggered shock events. The model's core interactions and constants must be explicitly defined and reproducible.
  philosophy: |
    The Grand Simulation serves as the Pirouette Framework's capstone stress test, moving from isolated analysis to integrated prognosis. Its purpose is not to predict the future with certainty, but to reveal the non-obvious, interconnected pathways of systemic risk. It forces an understanding that major crises are not independent variables, and that the winner may be the actor who best navigates the chaos rather than the one who wins a single conflict.
pirouette_definition: |
  A specific, multi-actor `PirouetteEngine` simulation designed to model the coupled dynamics of three primary global stressors: late-stage imperial collapse (the "Roman Overlay"), ideological/informational conflict (Coherence Warfare), and biospheric degradation (Climate Crisis). It models five principal actors—USA, China, Multipolar Bloc, the Biosphere, and Human Innovation—each with unique state variables (Γ, Tₐ, Φ) and interaction rules. The simulation's primary function is to identify critical inflection points, feedback loops, and cascading failures that determine the trajectory of global civilization in the 21st century.

        outline: |
          1. Instantiate five `PirouetteEngine` actors: USA, China, Multipolar Bloc, Biosphere, and Innovation, with the initial conditions for Γ, Tₐ, and Φ specified in the PDM-003 source code.
          2. Initialize the `SimulationManager` with these actors for a defined time period (e.g., 2025-2100) and time step (dt=0.1 years).
          3. Run the simulation loop, where in each step, the `update_interactions` function calculates the external forces on each actor based on the state of all other actors.
          4. Record the time-series history of Γ, Tₐ, and Φ for each actor.
          5. Log discrete "shock" events when specific state variables cross predefined thresholds (e.g., `usa.Ta < 0.6`).
        expected_signals: [Time-series plots for Γ, Tₐ, Φ; a textual event log of predicted shocks with timestamps.]
        pitfalls: [Over-sensitivity to initial conditions; model parameters are heuristics, not empirically derived constants; extreme simplification of complex geopolitical and ecological systems.]

    excerpt: |
      We want to overlay the dynamics of rome collapsing onto the US, which in my opinion is fairly accurate but in the information domain instead of geographic and national, then we want to overlay the climate crisis, then we want to overlay coherence warfare. The questions we want to answer are these: What does the future hold? When does the next major powers conflict break out into kinetic war, and who ultimately wins according to the simulation?

    excerpt: |
      This Grand Simulation provides a stark, integrated forecast. The future depicted is one of profound, cascading crises. The initial phase (2025-2040) is marked by intense but non-kinetic Coherence Warfare... The middle phase (2040-2070) is defined by two simultaneous events: the outbreak of Kinetic War and the catastrophic failure of the Biosphere... The final phase (2070-2100) is a "post-collapse" era of drastically reduced global power and stability.

      justification: |
        The simulation models the state evolution of multiple actors where the rate of change for each actor is a function of its own state and the states of all other actors. This mirrors the structure of competitive or symbiotic systems in mathematical biology and complex systems theory. For example, the `power.ext_Ta_ddot -= feedback_damage` term shows one actor's state directly degrading based on another's (the Biosphere's).

      justification: |
        The phase interaction term `power.ext_Phi_ddot += 0.3 * np.sin(phase_diff) * other_power.Gamma` is a direct analog of the Kuramoto model for coupled oscillators. It describes how actors tend to align their "goals" or "direction" (Φ) over time, with the coupling strength modulated by the power (Γ) of the influencing actor.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A major kinetic conflict between a declining unipolar power (USA) and a rising multipolar bloc is predicted to occur between 2040-2050, triggered by the unipolar power's internal coherence (Tₐ) falling below a desperation threshold (~0.6)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "The non-occurrence of such a conflict by 2055, or its primary trigger being unrelated to the internal socio-political decay of the unipolar power."
      status: proposed
      links: [PDM-003_the_colosseum]
    - statement: "A biospheric tipping point, defined as a non-linear acceleration in systemic degradation, will precede and exacerbate major geopolitical conflicts, occurring before 2040."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Global ecological metrics remain relatively stable or degrade linearly through 2050, and major geopolitical conflicts of that era are shown to have primarily economic or ideological, rather than ecological, drivers."
      status: proposed
      links: [PDM-003_the_colosseum]
    - statement: "Technological innovation, as an independent force, will fail to avert systemic collapse because its own growth capacity is critically dependent on the socio-economic stability that is being eroded by the other interacting crises."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "The successful deployment of one or more scalable breakthrough technologies (e.g., clean energy, advanced AI governance) after 2040 that demonstrably reverses biospheric degradation or geopolitical instability, even in a high-chaos environment."

  disambiguation: |
    The Grand Simulation is not a general-purpose, predictive world model. It is a specific, theoretical construct within the Pirouette Framework designed to illustrate the interplay of three specific crisis dynamics using the framework's core concepts (Γ, Tₐ, Φ). Its output should be interpreted as a strategic parable about interconnectedness, not a literal forecast.
