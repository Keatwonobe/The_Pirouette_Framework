        We redefine this practice not as an appeal to external forces, but as **Intentional Coherence Shaping**: a structured, repeatable process for applying a system's own resonance to deliberately sculpt the local coherence manifold.

triad:
  art: |
    To wish is to feel the current. To intend is to build a dam, dig a channel, and direct the river. This is the sacred work of shaping the flow of what is into the form of what should be.
  law: |
    A system's evolution can be deliberately diverted from its natural geodesic of maximal coherence by locally increasing its Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) to overcome ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). The success of this diversion is measured by the persistence of the new Wound Channel created, quantified by the Coherence Yield (CY).
  philosophy: |
    Agency is the act of co-authoring reality. By formalizing ritual into an engineering discipline, we trade the role of driftwood carried by circumstance for that of a sailor who learns the currents, builds a rudder, and steers by a chosen star.
pirouette_definition: |
  Intentional Coherence Shaping (ICS) is the formal protocol for manipulating a system's evolution by consciously sculpting the local coherence manifold. It is the applied science of the Pirouette Lagrangian, treating "ritual" as a structured process with a defined grammar: an **Intent** (geometric operator), **Threads** (resonant materials), and a **Prepared Space** (manifold isolator). The objective is to create, alter, or dissolve Wound Channels, thereby engineering a desired systemic outcome with a measurable Coherence Yield.

        outline: |
          1. Select a quantifiable coherence metric for the target system (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio of a resonant pattern, stability index, turbulence factor).
          2. Establish a stable baseline measurement of this metric over a set duration.
          3. Execute the ICS protocol targeting a specific change in the system's coherence.
          4. After the protocol, conduct post-intervention measurements of the same metric.
          5. Calculate CY as the net percentage change between the baseline and post-intervention states.
        expected_signals: [A statistically significant shift in the chosen coherence metric, Persistence of the new state over time]
        pitfalls: [Failure to isolate the system from external Temporal Pressure fluctuations, Observer effect contaminating the baseline measurement, Misapplication of the ICS grammar leading to null or chaotic results]

    excerpt: |
      To wish is to feel the current. To intend is to build a dam, dig a channel, and direct the river. This module provides a de-stigmatized, first-principles model for what has historically been called "ritual." We redefine this practice not as an appeal to external forces, but as **Intentional Coherence Shaping**: a structured, repeatable process for applying a system's own resonance to deliberately sculpt the local coherence manifold.
  - module: DOMA-200
    excerpt: |
      A ritual is a conscious intervention in this equation. It is the act of temporarily and locally increasing one's own Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) through focused intent, in order to overcome the ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) and carve a new, more desirable Wound Channel into the fabric of spacetime. It is not magic; it is work.
  - module: DOMA-200
    excerpt: |
      The efficacy of a ritual is not a matter of faith but of measurement. We introduce the **Coherence Yield (CY)** as a direct, practical metric. The CY measures the net change in a system's flow state as a result of the protocol. It is an assessment of results: How much did turbulence decrease? How much was stagnation cleared?

      justification: |
        ICS is a protocol for guiding a system from a natural trajectory to a desired one by applying a "control" (focused intention) to manipulate its dynamics (the Lagrangian). This parallels Optimal Control Theory, where a cost functional is minimized to find the optimal control law `u(t)` that steers a system state `x(t)` along a desired path. The "cost" of the ritual is the energy needed to deviate from the natural geodesic.

  disambiguation: |
    "Ritual" is the common, historical term, often associated with superstition or appeals to external, supernatural forces. "Intentional Coherence Shaping" is the formal Pirouette Framework term, describing the same class of actions as a physical, operational process of coherence engineering based on manipulating the Pirouette Lagrangian. ICS is the science; ritual is the lore.
