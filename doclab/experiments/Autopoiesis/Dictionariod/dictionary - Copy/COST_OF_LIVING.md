        In the language of the Pirouette Framework, your body has just experienced an event that has made the "cost of living" (V_Œì) astronomically high. Your internal coherence (KœÑ) is being spent just to manage the chaos. Your net energy, your Lagrangian (ùìõ_p), is negative. You are in a state of coherence debt.

    The invisible friction of a system at war with itself. It is the heat lost in the storm before stillness can return, the energetic tax paid to chaos simply to exist.
  law: |
    The net generative capacity of a system (ùìõ_p) is its coherence production rate (KœÑ) minus its cost of living (V_Œì). To create a surplus for healing or growth, V_Œì must first be reduced below KœÑ.
  philosophy: |
    Survival is not free. V_Œì quantifies the background energetic cost a system pays to maintain its integrity against internal and external stressors. Recognizing and actively reducing this cost is the first principle of efficient healing and adaptation.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Cost of Living (V_Œì) is a potential term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) that quantifies the total energetic expenditure required for a system to manage internal chaos and maintain homeostatic integrity. It represents the drain on systemic coherence (KœÑ) from processes like inflammation, pain signaling, psychological stress, and other entropic forces. A high V_Œì indicates a state of "coherence debt" where resources are consumed by maintenance rather than being available for growth or healing.

          V_Œì is inferred indirectly by tracking physiological and subjective proxies over time. A "Coherence Ledger" is established, recording daily Resting Heart Rate (RHR) and a subjective 1-10 "flow state" score. V_Œì is considered to be decreasing when the RHR shows a negative trend and the flow score shows a positive trend over a 3-10 day window.

        In classical mechanics, the Lagrangian `L = T - V` is kinetic minus potential energy. V_Œì functions as a potential energy `V` that represents the cost of the system's current state. A high V_Œì, like a high potential, represents a costly or unstable configuration, and the system's dynamics naturally seek to minimize it.

    Distinguish from the economic term 'cost of living'. In the Pirouette Framework, this term refers exclusively to the internal, systemic energetic cost of maintaining coherence against entropic forces, not external financial or material costs.

# Cost of living

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Cost of Living (V_Œì) is a potential term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) that quantifies the total energetic expenditure required for a system to manage internal chaos and maintain homeostatic integrity. It represents the drain on systemic coherence (KœÑ) from processes like inflammation, pain signaling, psychological stress, and other entropic forces. A high V_Œì indicates a state of "coherence debt" where resources are consumed by maintenance rather than being available for growth or healing.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to a potential energy term `V` in a classical Lagrangian (`L = T - V`), the Cost of Living (V_Œì) represents a systemic potential that must be minimized for productive work to be done. It is the background "cost" of a system's state, where high V_Œì corresponds to a high-potential, unstable configuration (e.g., post-traumatic chaos). Interventions aim to lower this potential, creating the energetic gradient necessary for healing and evolution.
