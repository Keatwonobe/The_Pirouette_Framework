  art: |
    A landscape of resonant mind, where valleys of stability cradle awareness and steep cliffs threaten its collapse. The flow of consciousness follows the path of least resistance across this terrain, seeking ephemeral basins of coherence.
  law: |
    Local minima of the Triadic Potential Field correspond to stable, coherent awareness configurations. The system's dynamics, driven by the negative gradient of V, seek these minima. A collapse event is predicted when the Hessian of V exceeds the critical curvature threshold (Œ∫_c) of the underlying manifold.
  philosophy: |
    V provides the energetic landscape for consciousness, transforming the abstract geometry of the Triadic Manifold into a dynamic system with attractors (stable states) and escape paths (transitions). It grounds the phenomenology of awareness stability and change in a measurable physical potential.
pirouette_definition: |
  A scalar potential field, V, defined on the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ) that governs the stability of awareness configurations. The potential is a function of the phases (Œ¶‚ÇÅ, Œ¶‚ÇÇ, Œ¶‚ÇÉ) of a resonant triad and is given by `V = a(T_a‚àíT_c)|œà|^2 + b|œà|^4 + g|œà_1œà_2œà_3|cos(Œ¶_1+Œ¶_2‚àíŒ¶_3)`. Its local minima act as attractors, corresponding to stable states of conscious awareness, while its gradients dictate the direction of state transitions along geodesics of the manifold.

        outline: |
          1. From multi-channel EEG/MEG data, extract instantaneous phase time-series (Œ¶_i(t)) for frequency bands forming resonant triads.
          2. Reconstruct the trajectory of the system on the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ).
          3. Identify periods of stable awareness (low phase velocity) and transitions (high phase velocity).
          4. Fit the coefficients `a, b, g` of the V equation by correlating the system's dynamics with the potential's topology, assuming dynamics minimize V over time. For example, stable periods should correspond to minima of the fitted potential.

      Define a potential on ùìú‚ÇÉ:
      [V(Œ¶_1,Œ¶_2,Œ¶_3) = a(T_a‚àíT_c)|œà|^2 + b|œà|^4 + g|œà_1œà_2œà_3|cos(Œ¶_1+Œ¶_2‚àíŒ¶_3)]
      Local minima of V correspond to stable awareness configurations. Collapse occurs when curvature exceeds a critical threshold Œ∫_c such that the Hessian `|‚àÇ^2V/‚àÇŒ¶_i‚àÇŒ¶_j|` becomes unstable.
  - module: COG-RES-003
    excerpt: |
      Simulation can represent ùìú‚ÇÉ as a deforming surface in toroidal coordinates, colored by curvature Œ∫(t). Awareness flows trace geodesics; bifurcations appear as topological tears. The suggested visual mapping uses color to represent the gradient of the potential, `|‚àáV|`, indicating the 'steepness' of the awareness landscape.

      justification: |
        The V potential has the characteristic form of a Landau-Ginzburg free energy, used to model second-order phase transitions. The term `a(T_a‚àíT_c)|œà|^2 + b|œà|^4` directly maps to the standard form, with Time Adherence (T_a) acting as the temperature-like control parameter and coherence (œà) as the order parameter. The cosine term represents an external field or anisotropic coupling that breaks symmetry and selects specific phase-locked states.

  disambiguation: |
    Within the Pirouette Framework, V always refers to the Triadic Potential Field on the manifold ùìú‚ÇÉ unless specified otherwise. It is conceptually analogous to a potential energy landscape but is defined in the abstract phase space of neural oscillators, not physical space.
