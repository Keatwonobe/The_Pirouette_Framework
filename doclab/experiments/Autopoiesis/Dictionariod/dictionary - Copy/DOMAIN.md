  art: |
    Each domain is a single instrument in reality's orchestra. To understand the music, the Weaver must listen not to one, but to the chord they form in unison.
  law: |
    The diagnostic power of a Resonant Concordance analysis is maximized by selecting a set of domains with the greatest conceptual and operational separation, as this stresses the falsifiability of any detected isomorphism.
  philosophy: |
    The act of defining a domain is a necessary fiction for analysis, but the ultimate goal is to dissolve these boundaries. By juxtaposing seemingly unrelated domains, the Weaver asserts the fundamental unity of systemic behavior and rejects the fragmented view of specialized knowledge.
pirouette_definition: |
  A distinct, bounded field of systemic activity (e.g., economics, public health, ecology) selected by a Weaver for cross-system analysis. A domain is defined by a set of native metrics that describe its state and dynamics. For the purposes of a Resonant Concordance analysis, these metrics are normalized into the universal variables of the Pirouette Framework, allowing the domain's behavior to be compared to others as a 'thread' in a Coherence Tapestry.

        outline: |
          1. Identify the high-level systemic behavior or Temporal Pressure under investigation (e.g., societal decline, rapid innovation).
          2. Hypothesize which distinct fields of reality would be affected by this pressure.
          3. Select 2-5 domains with maximal conceptual distance (e.g., combine epidemiology with political sentiment).
          4. For each domain, identify a primary time-series metric that can be normalized to Pirouette variables (e.g., Γ, Kτ).

        pitfalls:
          - "Domain Myopia: Selecting domains that are too closely related (e.g., S&P 500 and NASDAQ), which yields trivial correlations, not true resonance."
          - "Data Mismatch: Choosing domains where available data has different temporal resolutions (e.g., daily stock prices vs. annual GDP) that cannot be meaningfully aligned."

      A falling stock market, a spike in viral infections, and the rise of a new political narrative may appear as separate events. We analyze them in silos, mistaking the echoes for separate voices, blind to the symphony they compose together... It operationalizes the Principle of Correspondence by providing a formal protocol for detecting *isomorphism*... that manifests simultaneously across different domains of reality.

    excerpt: |
      Step I: Choosing the Threads (Domain Selection). The Weaver selects a set of two or more domains for analysis. The power of the analysis increases with the conceptual distance between the chosen threads. Example: A Weaver investigating systemic decline might choose threads from local economics (unemployment rates), public health (ER visits), infrastructure (power grid failures), and social media (sentiment analysis).

      justification: |
        The source module DOMA-154 explicitly states that a system follows a geodesic on its 'local manifold'. A Domain represents this manifold—the state space upon which the system's dynamics unfold. The Resonant Concordance protocol then seeks isomorphic structures between these distinct manifolds.

      rationale: |
        Provides a clear, operational mapping to complex systems theory. It captures the essence of a domain as a distinct yet interacting part of a larger whole, defined by its own internal state variables, which aligns with the Pirouette process of selecting domains and normalizing their native metrics.

      falsifier: "Repeated failure to detect a Resonant Concordance between hypothetically coupled, distant domains (e.g., solar flare activity and municipal bond default rates) during a known global-scale event (e.g., a solar superstorm). This would suggest that the Principle of Correspondence is not universally applicable."

  disambiguation: |
    Within Pirouette, a Domain is always a field of systemic activity chosen for analysis, such as 'the domain of public health' or 'the economic domain'. It is a macro-level categorical choice, not the input set of a mathematical function.

# Domain

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A distinct, bounded field of systemic activity (e.g., economics, public health, ecology) selected by a Weaver for cross-system analysis. A domain is defined by a set of native metrics that describe its state and dynamics. For the purposes of a Resonant Concordance analysis, these metrics are normalized into the universal variables of the Pirouette Framework, allowing the domain's behavior to be compared to others as a 'thread' in a Coherence Tapestry.

## EFT-First Summary
In a complex systems context, a Domain is analogous to a chosen **Subsystem** or a set of low-energy degrees of freedom. The Resonant Concordance protocol is then a method for finding unexpected couplings or a shared driving force between subsystems that would traditionally be treated in separate, decoupled theories. A detected concordance implies the existence of a higher-level interaction or shared environmental factor that couples the two subsystems, which was previously integrated out or ignored.
