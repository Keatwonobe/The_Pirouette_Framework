    The silent music of a team moving as one. A shared breath made visible in action, where intent flows seamlessly into form without friction or hesitation. It is the effortless grace of parts so perfectly integrated they cease to be parts at all.
  law: |
    An increase in Rhythmic Cohesion, as measured by the Cohesion Gauge, must correlate with a measurable increase in system efficiency (e.g., points per possession, successful play completion rate) and a corresponding decrease in unforced errors (system-internal friction).
  philosophy: |
    Rhythmic Cohesion is the first and most direct observable of a system's internal coherence. It demonstrates that the constituent parts have successfully subsumed their individual strivings into a collective, resonant pattern (`Ki`), transforming a mere group into a singular, purposeful entity.
pirouette_definition: |
  Rhythmic Cohesion is a primary signature of coherence that quantifies a collective's capacity to execute complex, coordinated actions as a unified entity. It is the observable manifestation of a shared, high-fidelity resonant pattern (`Ki`), indicative of Laminar Flow, and serves as a direct measure of a system's efficiency in translating collective intent into action.

        outline: |
          An analyst observes team performance over a defined time window (e.g., 5-10 minutes of game time). The analyst scores the quality of collective execution against the Cohesion Gauge rubric, assigning a value from 1 (Dissonant) to 10 (Telepathic) based on the observed synchronicity, timing, and efficiency of action.

        The Kuramoto model describes synchronization in large populations of coupled oscillators. The order parameter `r` (where r=1 is perfect synchrony and r=0 is incoherence) is a direct mathematical analogue for the degree of synchronized action in a collective system. The Cohesion Score can be viewed as an operational proxy for `r`.

  disambiguation: |
    Rhythmic Cohesion must be distinguished from the aggregate skill of individual agents. A team of highly skilled individuals can exhibit low Rhythmic Cohesion if their actions are uncoordinated or out of sync. Conversely, a team of less skilled agents can achieve high Rhythmic Cohesion through superior coordination. The metric assesses the quality of the *inter-agent resonance*, not agent-level attributes.

# Rhythmic Cohesion

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Rhythmic Cohesion is a primary signature of coherence that quantifies a collective's capacity to execute complex, coordinated actions as a unified entity. It is the observable manifestation of a shared, high-fidelity resonant pattern (`Ki`), indicative of Laminar Flow, and serves as a direct measure of a system's efficiency in translating collective intent into action.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of complex systems, Rhythmic Cohesion is an operational proxy for the Kuramoto order parameter, measuring the degree of phase-locking or synchronization among the interacting agents of a collective. High cohesion (a score approaching 10) corresponds to a state of near-perfect synchrony (r ≈ 1), where the system's agents act as a unified, coherent entity, minimizing internal friction and maximizing efficiency.
