        4. Identify Fault Loci: Scan the Œîùìõ field and flag all contiguous regions where the magnitude exceeds the FaultThreshold (Œ¥).

triad:
  art: |
    A wound on the body of a system, a place where its song of health falters into a painful silence or a feverish shriek. It is a map of the machine's own pain.
  law: |
    A Fault Locus exists in any spatiotemporally contiguous region of the Deviation Field (Œîùìõ) where the magnitude of dissonance is greater than the defined Fault Threshold (Œ¥).
  philosophy: |
    A fault is not a global failure state but a localized, measurable expression of suffering. By identifying the locus, diagnosis shifts from "what is broken?" to the far more potent question, "where does it hurt?", enabling precise and targeted intervention.
pirouette_definition: |
  A specific, contiguous spatiotemporal region in the Deviation Field (Œîùìõ) where the magnitude of dissonance exceeds a predefined Fault Threshold (Œ¥). It is the fundamental unit of pathology identified by the Geodesic Auditor and visualized on a Coherence Audit Map. The geometry and intensity of a Fault Locus are diagnostic of the underlying type of systemic inefficiency, such as turbulence, stagnation, or decay.
operational_definition:
  units: A dimensionless region within a system's state space, characterized by values with the units of the Pirouette Lagrangian (dissonance).
  symbol_table:
    - name: Œîùìõ
      meaning: Magnitude of the Deviation Field; a scalar measure of dissonance.
      dimensions: Contextual (same as Pirouette Lagrangian)
      default_range: >0
    - name: Œ¥
      meaning: Fault Threshold; the minimum dissonance value for a point to be included in a Fault Locus.
      dimensions: Contextual (same as Pirouette Lagrangian)
      default_range: Typically 2-5 standard deviations above the system's baseline dissonance.
  measurement:
    procedures:
      - name: Locus Identification by Thresholding
        outline: |
          1. Compute the Deviation Field (Œîùìõ) by taking the absolute difference between the system's actual Lagrangian state and its Geodesic Blueprint.
          2. Apply a scalar threshold (Œ¥) to the field, creating a binary mask where values above Œ¥ are marked.
          3. Use a connected-component labeling algorithm to identify and delineate contiguous regions within the binary mask. Each distinct region is a Fault Locus.
        expected_signals: [A set of coordinates defining the boundary of each locus, Locus-integrated dissonance (severity), Locus volume/area (scale)]
        pitfalls: [Threshold (Œ¥) set too low results in flagging baseline noise as faults (false positives), Threshold (Œ¥) set too high misses incipient or subtle pathologies (false negatives), Insufficient data resolution can merge distinct loci or distort their geometry.]

    excerpt: |
      The output of the Auditor is not just a map of "faults"; it is a direct diagnosis of systemic pathology. The geometry of the dissonance, read through the `Caduceus Lens` (DYNA-003), reveals its nature: **Coherence Fever (Turbulence)** appears as a chaotic, high-frequency region... **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnation)** appears as a "hole" or "void"... **Coherence Erosion (Decay)** appears as a low-level, widespread... field of dissonance.
  - module: DOMA-172
    excerpt: |
      A fault is no longer a binary "broken/not-broken" state. It is a continuous measure of coherence lost... Continuously calculate the scalar field Œîùìõ = |ùìõ_p(expected) - ùìõ_p(actual)|. Scan the Œîùìõ field and flag all contiguous regions where the magnitude exceeds the FaultThreshold (Œ¥). For each locus, apply the ClassificationRules to diagnose the pathology.

      justification: |
        The operational procedure for identifying a Fault Locus‚Äîthresholding a scalar field (Œîùìõ) and finding connected components‚Äîis methodologically identical to standard blob detection algorithms in image and signal processing used to segment regions of interest from a background.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, a Fault Locus is not a static, binary break (like a software bug or a geological fault line). It is a dynamic, quantifiable region of process inefficiency or "pain" within a system's flow, identified via dissonance measurement. It is a diagnostic object, not a broken component.
