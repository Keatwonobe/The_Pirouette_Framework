    The unseen riverbeds and channels that shape the flow of human intent. It is the social landscape—the roads, the wires, the laws—through which history moves and coherence is either sustained or broken.
  law: |
    The structure of the Societal Substrate (S_soc) dictates the geometry and magnitude of the emergent Social Dissonance Field (D). Higher structural impedance or asymmetry in S_soc correlates directly to increased antagonistic circulation (∇ × A) in the dissonance field.
  philosophy: |
    To understand social dynamics, one cannot only study the 'fluid' of interaction but must also map the 'vessel' that contains it. S_soc grounds abstract social forces in the material and political realities that constrain and enable them, making social physics actionable.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Societal Substrate (S_soc) is the multi-layered, weighted graph representing the physical, digital, and regulatory pathways available for social interaction. It encompasses all channels for communication (e.g., social networks, media), mobility (e.g., transport infrastructure), and policy implementation (e.g., legal frameworks, institutions). The topology and impedance of S_soc modulate the propagation of social tension (Γ) and determine the system's capacity for coherent flow.

          1. Identify relevant social agents (individuals, organizations, communities) as nodes.
          2. Map all known channels of interaction (communication links, trade routes, legal obligations, mobility paths) as edges between nodes, creating a multi-layer graph.
          3. Assign weights to edges representing channel capacity, frequency, regulatory friction, or cost of transit.
          4. Characterize the resulting graph using topological metrics (e.g., betweenness centrality, spectral gap, community structure) to define the substrate's properties.

        S_soc, like the metric tensor, defines the geometry and 'distance' for interactions within a social system. It is not the field itself, but the background structure that determines the 'straightest paths' (geodesics) for coherent flow and dictates how curvature (social tension) manifests as observable dynamics. Its topology defines the social manifold.

# Societal Substrate

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Societal Substrate (S_soc) is the multi-layered, weighted graph representing the physical, digital, and regulatory pathways available for social interaction. It encompasses all channels for communication (e.g., social networks, media), mobility (e.g., transport infrastructure), and policy implementation (e.g., legal frameworks, institutions). The topology and impedance of S_soc modulate the propagation of social tension (Γ) and determine the system's capacity for coherent flow.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, the Societal Substrate is analogous to the metric tensor (g_μν) in General Relativity. It defines the geometry of the social manifold, determining the shortest paths for interaction and how social forces manifest as observable motion. Just as spacetime tells matter how to move, S_soc dictates how social energy and information flow, with high-impedance regions acting as sources of effective curvature.
