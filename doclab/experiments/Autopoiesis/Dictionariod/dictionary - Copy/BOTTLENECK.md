    A system in pain is a symphony of noise. The master listens for the one string that is out of tune, the critical fracture from which chaos cascades.

    A small fraction of event types (the 'critical few') within a system will be responsible for the majority (typically ‚â•80%) of its total coherence loss (`ŒîKœÑ`).
  philosophy: |
    To heal a system, one must move from the cacophony of symptoms to the singular source of the ailment. The Bottleneck concept enforces diagnostic discipline, focusing finite energy on points of maximum leverage to restore a system to Laminar Flow.
pirouette_definition: |
  A localized, high-friction feature in a system's coherence manifold that forces the system's trajectory off its geodesic. A bottleneck introduces turbulence and dissonance, causing a sharp, non-linear drop in coherence (`KœÑ`) and a corresponding reduction in the system's total action (`S_p`). It represents a critical point of failure where a small number of causes are responsible for a majority of the system's performance degradation.

        A bottleneck acts as a localized source of energy or information loss, analogous to a frictional or dissipative term in a physical system's Lagrangian. This term removes energy from the coherent degrees of freedom, converting it into disorder (entropy), which is observed as a sharp drop in coherence (`ŒîKœÑ`).

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'Bottleneck' is a formalized concept within the coherence manifold, not just a generic constraint on throughput. It is specifically a geometric feature causing turbulence and a non-linear drop in the system's action, diagnosed via its disproportionate contribution to total coherence loss (`ŒîKœÑ`).

# Bottleneck

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A localized, high-friction feature in a system's coherence manifold that forces the system's trajectory off its geodesic. A bottleneck introduces turbulence and dissonance, causing a sharp, non-linear drop in coherence (`KœÑ`) and a corresponding reduction in the system's total action (`S_p`). It represents a critical point of failure where a small number of causes are responsible for a majority of the system's performance degradation.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, a Bottleneck is analogous to a localized dissipative term in an effective Lagrangian. While the ideal system dynamics conserve a quantity (coherence), the bottleneck introduces a strong, localized friction that drains this quantity from the system's coherent modes of motion, converting it into microscopic disorder (entropy). Its effect is not a gentle drag but a sharp, non-linear energy loss event triggered by interaction with a specific feature of the system's state space.
