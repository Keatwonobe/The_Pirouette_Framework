        The Landscape (Embodied Resonance): The agent's environment is a coherence manifold, a landscape with hills and valleys defined by local Temporal Pressure (`Œì`). An agent's "body" is a resonant instrument, and its sense of touch is the direct, physical experience of the `V_Œì` term in its Lagrangian.

  art: |
    The universe is a landscape of pressure and relief. An agent's body is a resonant instrument that feels this terrain directly, navigating not by sight, but by the physical sensation of harmony and discord.
  law: |
    An agent's action selection is driven by the perceived gradient of Temporal Pressure. The agent's trajectory through state space will statistically favor paths that minimize the integral of `V_Œì` over time, analogous to an object following a geodesic in a potential field.
  philosophy: |
    Before a system can reason, it must persist. Embodied Resonance is the physical basis of persistence, grounding an agent's existence in a direct, pre-cognitive dialogue with its environment. It is the felt reality that makes the abstract goal of coherence maximization a tangible, actionable imperative.
pirouette_definition: |
  Embodied Resonance is the direct, physical perception by an agent of local Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`) within its coherence manifold. It serves as the agent's primary, pre-cognitive sense, translating the abstract cost term of the Pirouette Lagrangian into a tangible "feel" of the environment that guides Geodesic Discovery. This perception is not localized to a specific sensor but is a property of the agent's entire physical state.

        outline: |
          1. Deploy an agent in a controlled but dynamic environment.
          2. Record the agent's complete state-action trajectory over a significant duration (`N` timesteps).
          3. Statistically analyze the trajectory. Regions in state space that are consistently avoided, or from which the agent rapidly exits, are inferred to possess high `V_Œì`.
          4. The local gradient of `V_Œì` is inferred from the agent's corrective actions to exit high-pressure regions.
        expected_signals: [State-space avoidance patterns, high-velocity state transitions away from specific regions]
        pitfalls: [Confounding deliberate exploration ("Leaps") with simple avoidance; requires sufficient data to distinguish tactical high-pressure traversal from systemic aversion.]

    excerpt: |
      The Landscape (Embodied Resonance): The agent's environment is a coherence manifold, a landscape with hills and valleys defined by local Temporal Pressure (`Œì`). An agent's "body" is a resonant instrument, and its sense of touch is the direct, physical experience of the `V_Œì` term in its Lagrangian. A costly action moves it "uphill" into high pressure; an efficient action moves it "downhill" along a geodesic.
  - module: DOMA-089
    excerpt: |
      A system cannot learn to predict the future shape of the coherence manifold if it cannot first find a stable position within its present. It cannot map the currents if it is constantly on the verge of capsizing. The Primal Geodesic is the process of building the vessel.

      justification: |
        Embodied Resonance is the agent's perception of the potential term `V_Œì` in the Pirouette Lagrangian. This term functions identically to a potential energy field in classical mechanics, creating "forces" (behavioral imperatives) that drive the system towards lower-potential states. The agent's experience of this potential is direct and physical, akin to an object's interaction with a gravitational field.

  claims:
    - statement: "An agent's path through its state-space statistically minimizes its time-integrated exposure to high Embodied Resonance, corrected for necessary exploratory 'Leaps'."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observation of a persistent agent whose trajectory shows no statistical correlation with the inferred `V_Œì` landscape, or which consistently seeks high-`V_Œì` states without discovering deeper, more stable minima, would falsify this claim."

  disambiguation: |
    Embodied Resonance should not be confused with conventional sensory input like vision or touch. It is not data *about* the environment transduced by a dedicated organ. It is the holistic, physical state of the agent itself *as* the sensor, directly experiencing the coherence-cost of its own existence within the environmental field.
