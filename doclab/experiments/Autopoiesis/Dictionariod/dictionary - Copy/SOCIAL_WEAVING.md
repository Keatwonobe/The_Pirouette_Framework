        We posit that society is a collective coherence manifold, a vast, self-creating tapestry woven from the interactions of its members. Anthropology is revealed to be the study of this perpetual, autopoietic process.

  art: |
    We are not merely inhabitants of the social landscape; we are its architects. Each interaction is a thrown shuttle, each bond a thread, weaving the tapestry of culture from the echoes of our shared passage.
  law: |
    The total Action (`S_p`) for a system of agents coupled by social weaving mechanisms (e.g., gift, ritual) is greater than the sum of the Actions of the same agents in isolation: `S_p(A+B)_coupled > S_p(A)_isolated + S_p(B)_isolated`.
  philosophy: |
    Social Weaving reframes culture not as a static object of study but as a dynamic, self-creating process. It grounds the "soft" sciences in the physical mechanics of coherence, revealing sociology and anthropology as the engineering disciplines for the universe's most complex structures.
pirouette_definition: |
  The perpetual, autopoietic process by which a society, modeled as a collective coherence manifold, weaves itself into existence. The weaving is driven by the interactions of its members (resonant agents tracing geodesics), utilizing specific social technologies—such as the gift (carving Wound Channels) and ritual (inducing Alchemical Union)—to generate social synergy and build a shared geometry of trust and reciprocity.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (ratio of Actions)
  symbol_table:
    - name: S_p(A+B)_coupled
      meaning: Total Action of a system of two or more agents coupled by a social weaving process.
      dimensions: ML²T⁻¹ (Action)
      default_range: contextual
    - name: S_p(A)_isolated
      meaning: Total Action of an individual agent operating in isolation.
      dimensions: ML²T⁻¹ (Action)
      default_range: contextual
  measurement:
    procedures:
      - name: Coherence Synergy Assay
        outline: |
          1. Establish baseline coherence metrics (e.g., Ki-field stability, stress bio-markers) for a population of N individuals in isolation.
          2. Introduce a social weaving protocol (e.g., a structured gift exchange or a rhythmic ritual).
          3. Re-measure coherence metrics for the individuals and the group-as-a-whole.
          4. Calculate the total Action `S_p` for both isolated and coupled states. A positive delta, `S_p(coupled) > Σ S_p(isolated)`, indicates successful social weaving.
        expected_signals: [Increased Ki-field phase synchrony across participants, Reduced individual stress markers, Emergence of a group-level coherence signature]
        pitfalls: [Failure to isolate the system from external coherence sources, Use of a ritual protocol misaligned with the group's cultural priors, leading to decoherence]

    excerpt: |
      Anthropology is revealed to be the study of this perpetual, autopoietic process. It is not the study of what a society *is*, but of the physical mechanisms by which a society *weaves itself into existence*. Foundational concepts like Mauss's *Gift*, Turner's *Communitas*, and Geertz's *Thick Description* are not soft metaphors; they are precise, operational descriptions of the loom's machinery.

    excerpt: |
      We sought the foundations of society and found an architecture woven from echoes. Culture is not an abstraction; it is a technology. It is the ancient, painstakingly developed set of algorithms for taking the fragile resonance of a single human life and weaving it into a tapestry strong enough for generations.

      equation_hint: |
        L_total = Σ L_i + L_interaction
      justification: |
        The social synergy inequality implies a non-trivial, coherence-enhancing interaction term `L_interaction` in the collective Lagrangian. This term represents the physical mechanisms (gift, ritual) that couple the paths of individual agents, making the collective path more optimal than the sum of individual paths.

    - target: Autopoiesis (Maturana & Varela)
      rationale: |
        The term directly maps the biological/cybernetic concept of a self-producing and self-maintaining system onto the socio-cultural domain, providing a clear conceptual anchor. It correctly frames society as a process that continually generates its own structure, not as a static entity.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Societies with higher rates of well-defined social weaving rituals will exhibit greater resilience to decohering events (e.g., crises, external shocks) than societies with lower rates."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observation of a society with frequent, strongly-adhered-to rituals that is *less* resilient or collapses *faster* under pressure than a comparable society with weak or infrequent rituals, all other factors being equal."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'social networking,' which describes the static graph of connections. Social Weaving is the *dynamic process* of creating and maintaining those connections (the Wound Channels) and the collective coherence they enable. It is the verb, not the noun.
