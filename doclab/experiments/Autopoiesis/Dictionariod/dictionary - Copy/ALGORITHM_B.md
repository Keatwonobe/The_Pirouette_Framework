  law: |
    Given a system with a defined entropy flux field ∇S, Algorithm B₁ identifies the unique stationary functional boundary ∂Ωₜ that minimizes the time-integrated Residue R over a period T_res ≥ 2τ_dominant, where τ_dominant is the longest characteristic timescale of the flux.
  philosophy: |
    By minimizing Residue, B₁ provides a non-arbitrary method for delineating a system from its environment. This boundary is not geometric but functional, defined by the stationarity of entropy flux, thereby isolating the coherent, persistent dynamics from transient environmental noise.
pirouette_definition: |
  Algorithm B₁ is an iterative computational method for identifying the unique functional boundary ∂Ωₜ of a transformation region Ω. It seeks a surface that minimizes the time-integrated Residue (R) by finding a stationary point for the area-weighted entropy flux functional J[Σ]=∫|∇S|dA. The procedure incorporates a residence-time filter (T_res ≥ 2τ_dominant) to ensure the solution is robust against high-frequency fluctuations, thus isolating the system's core, persistent dynamics.

        outline: |
          1. Define the transformation region Ω and its entropy flux field ∇S over time.
          2. Identify the dominant timescale τ_dominant from the flux's temporal power spectrum. Set residence time T_res ≥ 2τ_dominant.
          3. Initialize a candidate boundary surface Σ within Ω.
          4. Iteratively deform Σ to minimize the functional J[Σ]=∫|∇S|dA, effectively seeking the surface where the first variation δJ/δn = 0.
          5. Calculate the time-integrated Residue R across the final surface ∂Ωₜ over T_res. The result is the unique minimal-Residue boundary.

        δJ/δn=0  ↔  H_S = 0 (mean-curvature-like condition)
      justification: |
        B₁ identifies a boundary by minimizing a surface integral functional J[Σ]=∫|∇S|dA. The stationarity condition, derived from the first variation (Euler-Lagrange equation), is described as a 'mean-curvature-like condition' (H_S=0). This is mathematically analogous to finding minimal surfaces in geometry, which minimize an area functional.
