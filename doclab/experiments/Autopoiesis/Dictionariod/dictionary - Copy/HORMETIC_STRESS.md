triad:
  art: |
    Like a blacksmith's hammer, a small, controlled blow does not shatter the steel but strengthens it. This stress is an invitation for the body to become more resilient, more capable, and more alive.
  law: |
    A calibrated stress (σₕ) applied to a system is considered hormetic if and only if the system's post-recovery baseline performance (e.g., Temporal Coherence) is measurably higher than its pre-stress baseline. This is validated by a subjective Echo Score > 5 and stable or improved objective biometrics.
  philosophy: |
    Hormetic Stress is the engine of adaptation and growth, the mechanism by which a system escapes stasis. It is the active principle of forging, transforming mere stability into adaptive resilience by deliberately and safely probing the boundaries of capacity.
pirouette_definition: |
  A controlled, low-dose stressor intentionally applied to a biological or cognitive system, which triggers an adaptive response that increases the system's overall resilience, capacity, and Temporal Coherence (Kτ). The stress must be calibrated to fall within the hormetic zone, a range intense enough to stimulate adaptation but not so intense as to cause lasting damage.
operational_definition:
  units: Context-dependent (e.g., kg, m/s, cognitive load) or dimensionless ratio.

      meaning: A single application of a hormetic stressor.

      - name: Echo Score Assessment
        outline: |
          1. Establish a multi-day baseline of system metrics (e.g., Resting Heart Rate, Flow Score).
          2. Apply a calibrated stressor (e.g., 'Crucible Walk' intervals, 'Resilience Ritual' resistance).
          3. Approximately 24 hours post-stress, record the 'Echo Score,' a subjective 1-10 rating of energized recovery vs. depletion.
          4. Compare the Echo Score and post-stress baseline metrics to the pre-stress baseline.
        expected_signals: [Echo Score > 5, stable/improved subsequent Flow Score, stable/lowered subsequent Resting Heart Rate]
        pitfalls: [Applying stress that is too high (Echo Score < 5), insufficient recovery time between applications, mistaking pain for productive stress.]

      Goal 1: Introduce Hormetic Stress. Hormesis is the principle that a small, beneficial stress makes a system stronger. We will no longer just walk; we will sometimes walk a little faster. We will no longer just move; we will sometimes lift a little more. Goal 2: Listen to the Echo. After every challenge, we will listen. The body's response—its "echo"—tells us everything we need to know.

    excerpt: |
      In this phase, we are deliberately manipulating your Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p). The Crucible Walk and Resilience Ritual are controlled, temporary spikes in the "cost of living" (V_Γ). This intentional stress forces your system to find a more efficient solution. The "Echo Score" is your subjective measurement of the result. A high score signifies that your body has successfully adapted, increasing its internal Temporal Coherence (Kτ) to a new, higher baseline.

        Biphasic dose-response curve (U-shaped or J-shaped)
      justification: |
        The Pirouette concept of Hormetic Stress is a direct application of the biological principle of hormesis, which describes a biphasic dose-response relationship where low doses of a stressor elicit a beneficial, adaptive response, while high doses are toxic. Pirouette operationalizes this for systemic resilience training.

    - target: Hormesis (Biological Principle)
      rationale: The term is a direct import, and the operationalization within Pirouette aligns perfectly with the core biological concept of a beneficial adaptive response to low-dose stressors.

  claims:
    - statement: "Applying a calibrated stressor (σₕ) followed by adequate recovery will result in a net increase in systemic Temporal Coherence (Kτ), measurable via metrics like the Echo Score and Flow Score."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If repeated application of stressors as protocolized in DOMA-HLTH-004 consistently leads to a decrease in the Echo Score (<5), a sustained drop in the Flow Score, or other markers of chronic over-stress (e.g., elevated resting heart rate) across a population, the principle's application as a coherence-builder would be falsified."

  disambiguation: |
    Hormetic Stress must be distinguished from chronic stress or allostatic overload. Hormetic Stress is acute, calibrated, and followed by a necessary period of recovery that allows for adaptation. Chronic stress is sustained, depleting, and prevents positive adaptation.

# Hormetic Stress

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A controlled, low-dose stressor intentionally applied to a biological or cognitive system, which triggers an adaptive response that increases the system's overall resilience, capacity, and Temporal Coherence (Kτ). The stress must be calibrated to fall within the hormetic zone, a range intense enough to stimulate adaptation but not so intense as to cause lasting damage.

## EFT-First Summary
In biological terms, Hormetic Stress is the direct application of the hormesis principle, where a low-dose stressor stimulates a beneficial adaptive response. Pirouette models this as a controlled, temporary increase in a system's potential energy or "cost" term (V_Γ), which provokes a compensatory increase in its kinetic, or coherence, term (Kτ) post-recovery, leading to a more resilient and efficient baseline state. This U-shaped dose-response is a cornerstone of adaptive systems. (Ref: Calabrese & Baldwin, 2001).
