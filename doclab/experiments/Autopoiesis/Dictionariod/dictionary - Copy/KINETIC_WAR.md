  art: |
    The final, violent spasm of a dying empire. When the war of minds is lost, the system regresses, lashing out with steel and fire in a desperate, self-consuming tantrum.
  law: |
    A geopolitical actor transitions to Kinetic War when its internal Time-Adherence ($T_a$) falls below a desperation threshold (e.g., $T_a < 0.6$) while its Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) still exceeds that of a phase-opposed rival. The transition precipitates a catastrophic expenditure of $\Gamma$ and $T_a$.
  philosophy: |
    Kinetic War represents the ultimate failure of coherence. It is a regression from the complex, non-linear influence of Coherence Warfare to a brutish, negative-sum exchange of physical force. It signifies that an actor has lost the ability to shape the future and has chosen instead to destroy the present.
pirouette_definition: |
  A state transition of a system from Coherence Warfare to direct, physical conflict. This event is triggered by a critical loss of internal stability ($T_a$) in an actor that still possesses significant conventional power ($\Gamma$). The act of initiating Kinetic War is a costly, often pyrrhic, expenditure of system resources that accelerates the collapse of all participants.

  units: Event (dimensionless state flag).

    - name: $T_a$
      meaning: Time-Adherence (internal coherence/stability of an actor).

    - name: $\Gamma$
      meaning: Gladiator Force (total power/capacity of an actor).
      dimensions: contextual (e.g., "power units")
      default_range: [0, 3.0]

      - name: Desperation Threshold Monitoring
        outline: |
          1. Continuously monitor the state variables ($T_a$, $\Gamma$, $\phi$) for all major actors in a simulation.
          2. Identify pairs of actors in high phase opposition (e.g., $(1 - \cos(\Delta\phi)) / 2 > 0.8$).
          3. For each pair, check if one actor's $T_a$ has crossed a pre-defined desperation threshold (e.g., $T_a < 0.6$).
          4. If the threshold is crossed, verify that the low-$T_a$ actor still maintains a $\Gamma$ advantage over its rival.
          5. If all conditions are met, flag the occurrence of a Kinetic War event.
        expected_signals: [Event flag triggered in simulation log, discontinuous negative step function in the $\Gamma$ and $T_a$ time-series of belligerents.]
        pitfalls: [Setting the $T_a$ threshold too high or low, leading to premature or missed triggers. Failing to account for phase opposition, misattributing conflict triggers.]

  - module: PDM-003_the_colosseum
    excerpt: |
      The middle phase (2040-2070) is defined by two simultaneous events: the outbreak of **Kinetic War** and the catastrophic failure of the **Biosphere**, which cripples all nations. The final phase (2070-2100) is a "post-collapse" era of drastically reduced global power and stability, a struggle for survival in a broken world.
  - module: PDM-003_the_colosseum
    excerpt: |
      **Kinetic War Breaks Out around 2045:** The simulation triggers a war when the USA's internal coherence ($T\_a$) falls below a critical "desperation threshold," while its conventional power ($\Gamma$) is still high. It lashes out at the Multipolar Bloc, which it perceives as the primary source of its destabilization.

      justification: |
        The transition to Kinetic War can be modeled as a cusp catastrophe. The system's state (e.g., peaceful vs. warring) is the behavior variable, while slowly changing control parameters like internal coherence ($T_a$, acting as the 'splitting' factor) and external pressure ($\Delta\phi$, the 'normal' factor) push the system to a bifurcation point where it suddenly and discontinuously jumps to a new, lower-energy (but more destructive) state.

    - statement: "A system is most likely to initiate Kinetic War not at its peak power, but during its decline, specifically when internal coherence ($T_a$) collapses faster than its projectable power ($\Gamma$)."

      falsifier: "Consistent historical or simulated examples of highly coherent, stable powers initiating costly, existential wars without significant external provocation or internal decay."

  disambiguation: |
    Kinetic War must be distinguished from **Coherence Warfare**. The latter is a non-physical conflict over narrative, stability, and goal alignment ($T_a$ and $\phi$). Kinetic War is the regression to traditional, physical violence and destruction, targeting an opponent's Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$) directly.
