  art: |
    A ghost in the machine's static; the faint after-ring of a Higgs boson struck by the hammer of time. It is the subtle, off-beat echo in the collider's roar that proves the universe still has a pulse.
  law: |
    In high-energy hadron collisions, the Higgs-Pressuron coupling λ_HΓ induces a narrow resonance in the dilepton (e⁺e⁻, μ⁺μ⁻) invariant mass spectrum, located at M_ll ≈ 2m_Γ ≈ 34 MeV. The absence of this excess at predicted cross-sections falsifies the simplest coupling model.
  philosophy: |
    This tail is the most direct, low-energy window into the interaction between spatial coherence (Higgs) and temporal pressure (Pressuron). Its detection would confirm that the Higgs vacuum is not a static field but a dynamic medium, one whose "breathing" is tied to the cosmic expansion.
pirouette_definition: |
  A predicted, narrow-width excess in the soft dilepton invariant mass spectrum, centered at twice the Pressuron mass (2m_Γ ≈ 34 MeV), arising from the off-shell Higgs decay channel H* → ΓΓ in high-energy proton-proton collisions. This signature serves as a primary, low-mass collider probe of the direct Higgs-Pressuron coupling constant, λ_HΓ.

          1. Collect a high-statistics dataset of proton-proton collisions (e.g., >1 ab⁻¹ at LHC).
          2. Select events containing two oppositely charged, soft, isolated leptons (electrons or muons).
          3. Reconstruct the invariant mass (M_ll) of the lepton pair.
          4. Subtract estimated Standard Model and instrumental backgrounds.
          5. Search for a statistically significant excess of events in the mass window around 34 MeV.

      **Dynamic Interpretation:** The Higgs field represents the density of coherence, while Γ encodes temporal pressure. Their coupling is therefore the *pressure-density cross-term* in the equation of temporal state. At resonance, the two fields share energy, letting the Higgs “breathe” in time.

        Operationally, the search for the Resonant Production Tail is identical to a "bump hunt" for a new, light boson decaying to lepton pairs. The analysis techniques, background estimations, and statistical methods used in dark photon or Axion-Like Particle (ALP) searches are directly applicable. The key difference lies in the production mechanism via an off-shell Higgs.

    Distinguish from non-resonant tails of Standard Model processes (e.g., Drell-Yan) or other hypothetical low-mass resonances like the X17 particle. The Resonant Production Tail is specifically a *Higgs-mediated* phenomenon with a predicted mass locked to 2m_Γ.

# Resonant Production Tail

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A predicted, narrow-width excess in the soft dilepton invariant mass spectrum, centered at twice the Pressuron mass (2m_Γ ≈ 34 MeV), arising from the off-shell Higgs decay channel H* → ΓΓ in high-energy proton-proton collisions. This signature serves as a primary, low-mass collider probe of the direct Higgs-Pressuron coupling constant, λ_HΓ.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, this is a target for low-mass resonance searches ("bump hunts") in collider data, analogous to searches for dark photons or other light, exotic particles decaying to electron or muon pairs. Its unique feature within the Pirouette Framework is its specific production mechanism via a virtual Higgs boson (pp → H* → ΓΓ), which ties its production rate directly to the Higgs-Pressuron coupling. A confirmed detection would provide a measurement of λ_HΓ, while its absence at the sensitivities of the High-Luminosity LHC would strongly constrain the simplest form of this interaction.
