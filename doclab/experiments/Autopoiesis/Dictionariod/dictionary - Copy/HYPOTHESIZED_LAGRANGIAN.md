        Any predictive model of a system is, therefore, a formal hypothesis about that system's specific Lagrangian. We are proposing an 𝓛̂_model—a guess at the system's "objective function," the specific balance of coherence-seeking and pressure-avoidance that defines its nature.

    A map drawn in the language of physics, proposing the story a system intends to live out. It is the cartographer's first draft, an assertion waiting for the territory's reply.
  law: |
    A Hypothesized Lagrangian, when integrated over a path, yields a predicted action, Ŝ_pred. Any deviation of the observed action S_obs from Ŝ_pred provides a direct, quantifiable measure of the model's incompleteness via the Coherence Deficit.
  philosophy: |
    This reframes modeling not as a search for a final, "correct" description, but as a dialectical process. By positing an explicit 𝓛̂_model, we force our assumptions into a falsifiable form, turning every predictive failure into a precise vector for discovery.
pirouette_definition: |
  A formal, mathematical representation of a predictive model for a system's dynamics, structured as a specific instance of the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p). It serves as a testable hypothesis about the system's intrinsic 'objective function'—the specific balance of Temporal Coherence (K_τ) it seeks to maximize and Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) it seeks to minimize. Its primary function is to generate a predicted trajectory (q_pred(t)) and its associated coherence (K_τ_pred(t)), which can then be compared against observation to reveal unmodeled dynamics.

      To understand the Deficit, we must recall the core law of the framework. As established in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), a system evolves along a path that maximizes its action. Any predictive model of a system is, therefore, a formal hypothesis about that system's specific Lagrangian. We are proposing an `𝓛̂_model`—a guess at the system's "objective function"... The Coherence Deficit measures the degree to which the universe disagrees with our hypothesis.

        `𝓛̂_model` is analogous to a proposed Effective Lagrangian where a Weaver explicitly includes the assumed relevant degrees of freedom and interaction terms. The Coherence Deficit acts like experimental data that constrains or falsifies the model's coefficients, driving the inclusion of higher-order or previously ignored terms (the `𝓛_shadow`), akin to probing physics beyond a certain energy scale Λ.

# Hypothesized Lagrangian

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A formal, mathematical representation of a predictive model for a system's dynamics, structured as a specific instance of the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p). It serves as a testable hypothesis about the system's intrinsic 'objective function'—the specific balance of Temporal Coherence (K_τ) it seeks to maximize and Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) it seeks to minimize. Its primary function is to generate a predicted trajectory (q_pred(t)) and its associated coherence (K_τ_pred(t)), which can then be compared against observation to reveal unmodeled dynamics.

## EFT-First Summary
The Hypothesized Lagrangian (`𝓛̂_model`) is conceptually analogous to an **Effective Lagrangian (`L_eff`)** in Effective Field Theory. In this mapping, `𝓛̂_model` represents a specific, proposed theory for a system's dynamics up to a certain level of complexity or "energy scale." The terms included in the model are explicit hypotheses about the dominant forces and goals. Comparing the model's predictions to real-world data generates a **Coherence Deficit**, which functions like experimental results that reveal the influence of "higher-order" or unmodeled physics, compelling the refinement of `𝓛̂_model`.
