    The ceaseless current of the world, pushing, twisting, and eroding the patterns a system tries to hold. It is the grit in the gears, the noise that threatens the signal, the friction that both drains energy and provides the necessary traction for change.
  law: |
    Pressure (V_Γ) at a given scale (L) is quantified as the product of the amplitude of exogenous fluctuations and the system's coupling sensitivity to those fluctuations. Its change with scale (d V_Γ / d ln L) is governed by a canonical scaling exponent (d_Γ) and is attenuated by the system's internal Coherence (K_τ).
  philosophy: |
    Pressure represents the necessary and irreducible otherness of the environment. A system cannot exist in a vacuum; V_Γ is the measure of its non-solipsistic engagement with the world. Optimizing a system requires not just maximizing internal order (K_τ), but minimizing the costly friction (V_Γ) generated by its interaction with this external reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  Pressure (V_Γ) is a scale-dependent measure of the environmental drive or friction acting on a system. It is a component of the Pirouette Renormalization Group (PRG) state vector, representing the influence of exogenous forces that disrupt or drive the system's internal dynamics. Its flow (β_Γ) under a change of scale is governed by its own canonical dimension (d_Γ) and its interaction with the system's Coherence (K_τ), typically acting as a dissipative or decohering influence.

          1. At a given scale L, identify and isolate exogenous (external) driving signals relevant to the system.
          2. Measure the variance of these drivers over a representative time window.
          3. Measure the system's output variance that is correlated with or can be attributed to the drivers (this is the system's sensitivity or coupling).
          4. V_Γ is proxied by the product of the driver variance and system sensitivity. For example, in a language model, this could be the variance of embeddings for known topic-switch tokens multiplied by the model's perplexity increase following those tokens.

        In stochastic dynamics, the friction/drag term (`γ`) and the amplitude of the stochastic noise force (`D`) both represent the influence of an external environment (a heat bath). V_Γ combines the magnitude of this external influence (variance) with the system's susceptibility to it (coupling), playing a role analogous to a scale-dependent friction or noise power.

  disambiguation: |
    V_Γ is not a potential energy `V` in the Hamiltonian sense, but rather a kinetic-like measure of environmental friction or drive; a 'potential for decoherence'. The subscript `Γ` is chosen to evoke its connection to dissipative processes (width, decay rate) and distinguish it from conservative potentials.

# Pressure

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Pressure (V_Γ) is a scale-dependent measure of the environmental drive or friction acting on a system. It is a component of the Pirouette Renormalization Group (PRG) state vector, representing the influence of exogenous forces that disrupt or drive the system's internal dynamics. Its flow (β_Γ) under a change of scale is governed by its own canonical dimension (d_Γ) and its interaction with the system's Coherence (K_τ), typically acting as a dissipative or decohering influence.

## EFT-First Summary
In an effective field theory context, Pressure (`V_Γ`) acts as a scale-dependent measure of the integrated-out environmental degrees of freedom. It is analogous to a friction coefficient or the amplitude of a stochastic noise term in a Langevin equation, quantifying the dissipative influence of the environment on the system's coherent dynamics. This term captures how external fluctuations, not explicitly modeled in the core theory, impact the system's behavior across different scales.
