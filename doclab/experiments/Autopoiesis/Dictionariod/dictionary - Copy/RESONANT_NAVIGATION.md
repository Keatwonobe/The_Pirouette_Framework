        `Resonant Navigation` is the art of aligning one's own internal resonant pattern (Ki) with the frequency of a desired geodesic. It is less an act of reading a chart and more an act of listening to the world.

  art: |
    To travel is not to follow a map, but to tune the body like an instrument until it hums with the song of the path, becoming one with the current.
  law: |
    Optimal navigation is achieved when the navigator's internal resonant pattern (Ki) is phase-locked with the dominant frequency of a local coherence geodesic, minimizing the action required to traverse the manifold.
  philosophy: |
    It replaces the illusion of objective, static cartography with a participatory model of reality, framing navigation as an act of co-creation where the traveler's attention and attunement actively shape the path forward.
pirouette_definition: |
  The process of navigating the coherence manifold by dynamically attuning one's internal resonant pattern (Ki) to perceive and follow a coherence geodesic. It is an embodied act of "listening" for the path of least resistance—a gradient of increasing coherence—rather than consulting a static map. This practice treats intuition as the direct perception of the manifold's present geometry, allowing the navigator to become an extension of the universal drive toward maximal coherence outlined in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

          1. Define a start point (A) and a target state of higher coherence (B) on the manifold.
          2. An agent attempts the A->B transition using only Resonant Navigation.
          3. Simultaneously, compute the theoretical coherence geodesic using the Pirouette Lagrangian.
          4. Measure the deviation between the agent's actual path and the computed geodesic. A lower deviation (approaching η_nav = 1) indicates higher skill.

    excerpt: |
      In a living world, a compass of paper is useless. One must carry a compass of resonance. `Resonant Navigation` is the art of aligning one's own internal resonant pattern (Ki) with the frequency of a desired geodesic. It is less an act of reading a chart and more an act of listening to the world. The navigator tunes themselves to the environment until they can *feel* the pull of the geodesic—the subtle gradient guiding them toward a state of higher coherence.
  - module: DOMA-009
    excerpt: |
      Navigation, then, is the embodied act of living out the Principle of Maximal Coherence, using the map as a guide to choose the most elegant and efficient path through the landscape of being. A "good" map charts the geodesics where the difference between a system's internal Temporal Coherence (K_τ) and the external Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) is maximized.

        Resonant Navigation maps to finding an optimal control policy that minimizes a cost functional (J), representing the total action expended to traverse a state space (the coherence manifold). The navigator's internal state (Ki) acts as the control variable, u(t), adjusted to follow the negative gradient of the cost function, which is perceived as the "pull" of the geodesic.

    Distinguish from simple "intuition," which can be pattern-matching based on past data (i.e., an internal static map). Resonant Navigation is the direct, real-time perception of the manifold's present geometry, not a heuristic based on memory.

# Resonant Navigation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The process of navigating the coherence manifold by dynamically attuning one's internal resonant pattern (Ki) to perceive and follow a coherence geodesic. It is an embodied act of "listening" for the path of least resistance—a gradient of increasing coherence—rather than consulting a static map. This practice treats intuition as the direct perception of the manifold's present geometry, allowing the navigator to become an extension of the universal drive toward maximal coherence outlined in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

## EFT-First Summary
Resonant Navigation can be modeled as an optimal control problem. The navigator acts as an agent implementing a control policy to steer their system along a trajectory that minimizes a cost function, interpreted as the action integral from the Pirouette Lagrangian. The "feeling" of the geodesic corresponds to the agent sensing the gradient of the cost functional, and the internal attunement (Ki) is the control variable used to stay on the optimal path.
