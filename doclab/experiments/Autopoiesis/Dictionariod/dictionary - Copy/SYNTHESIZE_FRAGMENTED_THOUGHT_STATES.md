triad:
  art: |
    The art of mending a shattered thought with seams of gold, creating a new and more resilient pattern from the break. It is kintsugi for the mind.
  law: |
    The rate of successful insight synthesis from fragmented states is directly proportional to an agent's trained tolerance for cognitive dissonance and inversely proportional to the recovery time from induced interruptions.
  philosophy: |
    Cognitive integrity is not the absence of fracture, but the practiced capacity to reassemble fragments into a more complex and adaptive whole. This skill transforms external disruption from a threat into a resource for novel thought.
pirouette_definition: |
  The core trainable skill of deliberately integrating interrupted, contradictory, or partial cognitive states (ψᵢ) into a novel, coherent line of reasoning or "insight path." Developed within the Interruptive Cognition crucible (XCM-001), it is the primary mechanism for converting induced cognitive fragmentation into adaptive plasticity.

        outline: |
          Present a subject with a scrambled system description (e.g., disconnected technical specs, mixed-up narrative events). The subject must construct a coherent explanation under timed, interrupted conditions (e.g., using cognitive chirps). The score is based on the logical consistency and completeness of the resulting synthesis, normalized against baseline performance.
        expected_signals: [Decreased time-to-coherence across training trials, Increased complexity of synthesized outputs, EEG gamma-band activity spikes associated with insight]
        pitfalls: [Subject confabulates a plausible but incorrect synthesis, Scoring rubric is overly subjective, Interruption intensity prevents any synthesis (overload)]

        The process of rebuilding a coherent model (Hypothesis, H) from fragmented data (Evidence, E) mirrors the Bayesian process of updating a prior to form a posterior. Synthesis is the successful formation of a high-probability posterior from noisy or contradictory inputs.

# Fragmented State Synthesis

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The core trainable skill of deliberately integrating interrupted, contradictory, or partial cognitive states (ψᵢ) into a novel, coherent line of reasoning or "insight path." Developed within the Interruptive Cognition crucible (XCM-001), it is the primary mechanism for converting induced cognitive fragmentation into adaptive plasticity.

## EFT-First Summary
This process is conceptually mapped to the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis, where synthesis is the successful formation of a high-probability posterior belief model from fragmented or noisy evidence. It also aligns with Integrated Information Theory (Φ), where uniting disparate cognitive states into an irreducible whole represents an increase in the system's integrated information.
