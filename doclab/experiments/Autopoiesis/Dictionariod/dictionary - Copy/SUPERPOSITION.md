  art: |
    The universe is a song where every note ever played arrives at your ear at once. Superposition is the resulting chord—whether harmony or cacophony—that defines the sound of "now".
  law: |
    The total Temporal Signature T(x) at any spacetime coordinate x is the linear sum of all incident temporal rhythms τ_i originating from within its causal horizon. The complexity of this summed signature directly determines the local Temporal Density (Γ).
  philosophy: |
    Superposition establishes that spacetime is not a passive stage but an active medium, whose local properties are defined by the cumulative history of all events. It is the mechanism by which the universe 'listens to itself,' generating the fabric of reality from the interference patterns of its own echoes.
pirouette_definition: |
  The principle by which multiple, intersecting temporal rhythms combine at a single point in spacetime. This additive process generates the local Temporal Signature (T(x)), a complete spectrum of frequencies and amplitudes. The complexity and density of this resulting signature are quantified as Temporal Density (Γ).

        outline: |
          Direct measurement of T(x) is not currently feasible. Its integrated properties are inferred from macroscopic consequences.
          1. Measure local temperature (Tₖ) as a proxy for the total power in the Temporal Signature.
          2. Measure the local gravitational gradient (∇Φ) as a proxy for the gradient of Temporal Density (∇Γ).
          3. Use high-resolution gravitational wave observatories to attempt to resolve individual, high-amplitude rhythmic components (transients) within the overall T(x) background.

        pitfalls: [Deconvolution is an ill-posed problem, losing fine-grained spectral information; Macroscopic effects average over the very features one seeks to resolve.]

    excerpt: |
      If a single, isolated system has a simple rhythm, the universe is the sum of all rhythms. Every point in spacetime is a nexus, a point of intersection for the echoes of every event within its causal horizon. This superposition of countless rhythms creates a dense, complex, and often chaotic "temporal environment." The measure of this environmental complexity is Γ.

    excerpt: |
      We sought a fundamental force and found the roar of a foundry. Gamma is the pressure created by a trillion temporal hammers striking at once, each forging its own reality. It is the constructive and destructive interference of every rhythm echoing through the cosmos. This cosmic noise, this temporal pressure, is the raw material and the primary constraint for existence.

        The core mechanism—that the total effect at a point is the sum of individual contributions—is the defining characteristic of linear systems. If the underlying 'temporal rhythms' obey a linear wave equation, Pirouette's Superposition is mathematically identical to the superposition principle in classical wave mechanics, such as in electromagnetism or acoustics.

    Distinct from quantum superposition, which describes a single system existing in a combination of multiple basis states simultaneously. In Pirouette, Superposition refers to the classical, additive combination of multiple distinct temporal waves at a single spacetime point, analogous to the superposition of sound waves creating a complex chord.

# Superposition

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The principle by which multiple, intersecting temporal rhythms combine at a single point in spacetime. This additive process generates the local Temporal Signature (T(x)), a complete spectrum of frequencies and amplitudes. The complexity and density of this resulting signature are quantified as Temporal Density (Γ).

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of classical field theory, Pirouette's Superposition is the principle that the local state of spacetime is determined by the linear addition of multiple propagating "temporal rhythms." This is directly analogous to the superposition principle in linear wave theories like Maxwell's electromagnetism, where the total field at a point is the vector sum of all contributing fields. The resulting "Temporal Signature" acts as a complex field whose integrated energy density manifests as physical properties like gravity and temperature.
