        Negative Charge (Trough-Leading): Defined as a system whose coherence, K_œÑ, is maximized by interacting with environments of out-of-phase temporal rhythms. It seeks destructive interference to maintain its internal stability.

  art: |
    A quiet note holding its pitch against a dissonant choir. It finds its form not by blending in, but by perfectly opposing the surrounding song, carving a space of stability from the noise.
  law: |
    A system with negative charge, when free to move, will accelerate along a gradient of temporal phase (an electric field) towards regions that are maximally out-of-phase (œÄ radians) with its own internal rhythm, thereby maximizing its temporal coherence K_œÑ.
  philosophy: |
    Charge is not a substance a particle possesses, but a relational strategy for navigating its environment. Negative charge embodies the principle that stability can be achieved through opposition and dissonance, not just harmony and resonance.
pirouette_definition: |
  Negative charge is the intrinsic property of a system whose temporal coherence (K_œÑ) is maximized by interacting with out-of-phase environmental rhythms. Such a system actively seeks regions of destructive interference to preserve its internal stability, manifesting as an attraction to positively charged (in-phase seeking) systems. It is fundamentally an asymmetric bias in the system's Pirouette Lagrangian.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless asymmetry parameter, mapping to Coulombs (C) in the Standard Model.

        outline: |
          Introduce a test system into a known, static coherence gradient (an electric field generated by a source with established positive charge). The test system's initial acceleration vector indicates the direction of its coherence-seeking drive. If it accelerates towards the source, it is negatively charged.
        expected_signals: [Non-zero acceleration along the coherence gradient (E-field lines).]
        pitfalls: [Confounding forces (e.g., gravity), motional magnetic effects if the test particle has initial velocity.]

    excerpt: |
      Likewise, a positive and negative charge will move towards each other, as doing so allows each to satisfy its intrinsic coherence-seeking drive.

      justification: |
        The defined behavior‚Äîattraction to positive charges and repulsion from negative charges‚Äîis operationally identical to the electrostatic force on a negative charge in the Standard Model. The Pirouette framework re-interprets this "force" as a system following a coherence gradient.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A system identified as negatively charged will always move to minimize its interaction with in-phase environmental rhythms, effectively seeking regions of maximal temporal phase opposition."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "The discovery of a system that is attracted to positive charges but can be shown to maximize its temporal coherence (K_œÑ) in an in-phase resonant environment, contradicting its Trough-Leading definition."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol 'C' is overloaded (Capacitance, Coulombs); the `‚Åª` superscript is crucial for clarity.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the Standard Model concept of charge as a fundamental, quantized "substance." In Pirouette, it is a *bias* in how a system interacts with its environment to maintain coherence. The alias "Trough-Leading" emphasizes this dynamic, relational nature.
