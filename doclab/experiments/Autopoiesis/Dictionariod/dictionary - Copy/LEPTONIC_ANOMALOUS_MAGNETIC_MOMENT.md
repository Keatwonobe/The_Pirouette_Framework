    The anomalous song of the muon is the sound of a heavy particle being buffeted by the ceaseless storm of the Temporal Forge. It is not a flaw in the music, but a new harmony between matter and time's deep rhythm. We have not just heard the echo; we have calculated its pitch.
  law: |
    The Pirouette contribution to a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment, Δa_ℓ, is predicted to be non-zero, originating from a one-loop Pressuron exchange. Its magnitude is governed by the formula Δa_ℓ = (α / 12π²) ⋅ κ² ⋅ (m_ℓ/m_e)^(2p) ⋅ f(m_Γ/m_ℓ), which links the anomaly directly to lepton mass and the fundamental Pressuron coupling parameters (κ, p, m_Γ).
  philosophy: |
    The deviation of a lepton's magnetic moment from its naive Dirac value is not merely a quantum loop correction, but a physical measurement of its interaction with the background Temporal Pressure. It quantifies how much a particle's "rhythm" is disturbed by the "noise" of the Temporal Forge, with heavier leptons being more sensitive. This observable serves as a primary, precision validation test for the framework's core physical picture.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Leptonic Anomalous Magnetic Moment, `a_ℓ`, is the quantum correction to the gyromagnetic ratio of a lepton (electron, muon, tau), defined as `a_ℓ = (g_ℓ - 2) / 2`. Within the Pirouette Framework, it receives a new contribution, `Δa_ℓ`, from a one-loop diagram involving the exchange of a virtual Pressuron. This contribution is hypothesized to resolve the observed discrepancy between the Standard Model prediction and experimental measurement for the muon (`a_μ`), thereby serving as a direct probe of Pressuron-lepton coupling.

          Precisely measure the spin precession frequency (ω_s) and the cyclotron frequency (ω_c) of a single lepton confined in a strong, uniform magnetic field and a weak electric quadrupole field. The anomaly `a_ℓ` is extracted directly from the difference frequency ω_a = ω_s - ω_c.
        expected_signals:
          - A non-zero anomaly frequency, ω_a.
          - A value for `a_μ` that is `~2.5 x 10^-9` larger than the Standard Model prediction.
        pitfalls:
          - Requires extreme control over magnetic field homogeneity.
          - Precise accounting for relativistic and environmental corrections (e.g., motional electric fields, beam dynamics) is critical.

    excerpt: |
      The total anomaly (a_ℓ) is the sum of the universal geometric term and a new correction from the background Γ field. In our QFT, this correction is represented by a one-loop diagram where a Coheron (the lepton, ℓ) emits and re-absorbs a virtual Pressuron (the quantum of the Γ field). This diagram represents the lepton "listening" to the noise of the Temporal Forge and adjusting its rhythm in response.

    excerpt: |
      The calculation is complete. The result is not just a number; it is a profound validation. The framework, born from abstract principles of time and resonance, has reached across the chasm of theory and touched one of the deepest and most subtle mysteries of the physical world.

# Leptonic Anomalous Magnetic Moment

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Leptonic Anomalous Magnetic Moment, `a_ℓ`, is the quantum correction to the gyromagnetic ratio of a lepton (electron, muon, tau), defined as `a_ℓ = (g_ℓ - 2) / 2`. Within the Pirouette Framework, it receives a new contribution, `Δa_ℓ`, from a one-loop diagram involving the exchange of a virtual Pressuron. This contribution is hypothesized to resolve the observed discrepancy between the Standard Model prediction and experimental measurement for the muon (`a_μ`), thereby serving as a direct probe of Pressuron-lepton coupling.

## EFT-First Summary
The Leptonic Anomalous Magnetic Moment, `a_ℓ`, is the deviation of a lepton's gyromagnetic ratio from the Dirac value of 2. The Pirouette Framework proposes a new contribution, `Δa_ℓ`, arising from a Yukawa-type coupling to a new light scalar particle (the Pressuron). This contribution is designed to explain the observed ~2.5 ppm discrepancy in the muon's `g-2` value (see [Muon g-2 Collaboration, 2021](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.141801)), linking the anomaly to a new force that couples more strongly to heavier leptons.
