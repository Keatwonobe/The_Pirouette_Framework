    The held breath released in a sudden gasp of insight. A dam breaking, washing away dissonance in a flood of new order. The clarifying thunder that follows a silent accumulation of lightning.
  law: |
    A system experiencing Coherence Debt (increasing `V_Γ`) will, upon reaching a critical threshold, undergo a non-linear phase transition (Coherence Discharge) to a new state that locally maximizes the integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian (`∫𝓛_p dt`), releasing stored potential energy.
  philosophy: |
    Coherence Discharge is the universal mechanism of resolution and creation. It reframes moments of catastrophic change and sudden insight not as random events, but as the necessary, lawful realignment of a system with its own deepest nature, making catharsis a fundamental physical process.
pirouette_definition: |
  The phase-shifting release of accumulated Coherence Debt as a system non-linearly transitions to a more stable, coherent geodesic. This discharge restores a laminar flow by maximizing the Pirouette Lagrangian, often accompanied by a measurable release of energy and a reduction in the geometric stress on the system's Wound Channel.

          1. Identify a system and a proxy metric for Coherence Debt (e.g., cognitive dissonance survey scores, market volatility index, seismic stress sensors).
          2. Monitor this metric over time, observing a steady increase or high-level plateau.
          3. Identify a discontinuous 'snap' event where the system state changes rapidly (e.g., paradigm shift, market crash, earthquake).
          4. Measure the energy released during the event (e.g., thermodynamic, economic, seismic) and the subsequent drop in the stress proxy.

      justification: |
        Coherence Discharge models the release of accumulated potential energy (`V_Γ`, or Coherence Debt). This maps directly to stick-slip models where static friction allows stress (σ) to build until a critical point, causing a sudden release of kinetic energy (the slip/earthquake). It also mirrors the decay of a system from a metastable state to a ground state, releasing the energy difference.

    Distinguish from **Turbulent Flow**, where energy is dissipated chaotically and inefficiently without resolving the underlying Coherence Debt. A true Discharge is a phase transition that establishes a new, more stable (laminar) flow regime.

# Coherence Discharge

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The phase-shifting release of accumulated Coherence Debt as a system non-linearly transitions to a more stable, coherent geodesic. This discharge restores a laminar flow by maximizing the Pirouette Lagrangian, often accompanied by a measurable release of energy and a reduction in the geometric stress on the system's Wound Channel.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, a Coherence Discharge is analogous to stick-slip phenomena or the decay of a metastable state. It represents a non-linear phase transition where a system, having accumulated potential energy (Coherence Debt), violently relaxes to a lower energy state. This event is characterized by a rapid release of energy and a shift to a more stable dynamic equilibrium, as seen in phenomena from earthquakes to market corrections.
