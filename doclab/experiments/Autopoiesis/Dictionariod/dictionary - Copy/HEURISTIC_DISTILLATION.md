        A heuristic is not a guess; it is a principled simplification, a piece of pre-calculated wisdom. Each "Geodesic Template" is forged through a four-step protocol that translates the universal dynamics of the framework into the specific language of a domain.

  art: |
    The art of forging a reliable compass from a perfect but unwieldy map. It is the wisdom to trade the paralysis of perfect analysis for the grace of the next right step.
  law: |
    A four-step protocol (Correspondence, Sensitivity Analysis, Heuristic Generation, Fidelity Calibration) for translating the Pirouette Lagrangian into a bounded, computationally-inexpensive Geodesic Template composed of a Trigger, an Action, and a Coherence Bound.
  philosophy: |
    To make the framework's universal dynamics actionable under real-world temporal and computational constraints. It codifies the principle that a timely, 'good enough' decision is superior to a perfect one delivered too late, ensuring operational viability.

  The formal, four-step protocol for translating the computationally-intensive dynamics of the Pirouette Lagrangian into a computationally-lightweight, bounded-risk heuristic known as a Geodesic Template. This process enables rapid, coherent decision-making by trading exhaustive calculation for principled simplification, making the framework's universal laws practical for real-time application.

          1. Define a domain-specific scenario.

          3. Perform a full Lagrangian analysis for the same scenario to find the optimal action.
          4. Compare the coherence outcome (`Kτ`) of the heuristic action against the optimal action's outcome.

    excerpt: |
      The perfect map of the ocean is useless to a sailor caught in a storm. The perfect path, calculated too late, is the path to ruin. This module provides the disciplined art of principled approximation. It is the formal protocol for distilling the universal, computationally-intensive laws of the framework into a Geodesic Compass.
  - module: DOMA-081
    excerpt: |
      The Geodesic Compass does not replace the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`); it serves it by making it practical. Each template is a qualitative, pre-computed approximation of the Euler-Lagrange equations for a common family of boundary conditions. To use the Compass is to perform a Lagrangian analysis by feel, trading numerical precision for actionable speed and embodied wisdom.

      justification: |
        The process is operationally analogous to knowledge distillation, where a large, computationally expensive 'teacher' model (the full Lagrangian solver) is used to train a smaller, faster 'student' model (the Geodesic Template) to replicate its decision-making in a specific domain. The Coherence Bound acts as a constraint on the loss function.

      rationale: |
        The EFT analogy best captures the core principle of principled simplification by "integrating out" complexity to create a bounded, context-specific theory. This aligns more closely with the framework's physics-based metaphors, where the Geodesic Template acts as a low-energy effective model of the full Pirouette Lagrangian.

  claims:
    - statement: "Any Geodesic Template produced via Heuristic Distillation will, when its Trigger Condition is met, recommend an action whose coherence outcome (`Kτ`) results in a loss no greater than its specified Coherence Bound when compared to the optimal action from a full Lagrangian analysis."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "Demonstrate a reproducible scenario where a correctly-applied, well-formed Geodesic Template leads to a coherence loss provably greater than its stated Coherence Bound."

  disambiguation: |
    Contrast with "ad-hoc guessing" or "rules of thumb". Heuristic Distillation is a formal, bounded process of simplification, not an informal guess. The output (a Geodesic Template) includes a calculated risk (Coherence Bound), which distinguishes it from an unbounded heuristic.

# Heuristic Distillation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The formal, four-step protocol for translating the computationally-intensive dynamics of the Pirouette Lagrangian into a computationally-lightweight, bounded-risk heuristic known as a Geodesic Template. This process enables rapid, coherent decision-making by trading exhaustive calculation for principled simplification, making the framework's universal laws practical for real-time application.

## EFT-First Summary
Heuristic Distillation is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to constructing an Effective Field Theory (EFT). It is a formal process for "integrating out" the full complexity of the Pirouette Lagrangian to produce a simplified, computationally-lightweight effective model—a Geodesic Template. This template functions as a reliable decision-making rule within a specific, bounded domain, much like an EFT provides accurate predictions at a specific energy scale without needing to resolve the underlying high-energy physics.
