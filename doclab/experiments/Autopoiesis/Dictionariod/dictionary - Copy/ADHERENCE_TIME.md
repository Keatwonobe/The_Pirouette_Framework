        Prediction: Using the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem, we can calculate the system's T_a. The theory predicts that the system will undergo a phase transition (i.e., lose its stable rhythm) when the integrated environmental noise reaches a critical threshold determined by its T_a.

  art: |
    The duration a system can hold its song true against the universe's dissonant hum. It is the measure of a pattern's stubborn refusal to dissolve into noise.
  law: |
    A rhythmic system will undergo a phase transition when the time-integrated environmental noise exceeds a critical threshold directly proportional to its Adherence Time (T_a). Additionally, the product of information gained from observing a system and the resulting reduction in its Adherence Time is bounded from below by a universal constant (I * ΔT_a ≥ C).
  philosophy: |
    Adherence Time quantifies a system's will to exist as a coherent entity. It is not merely a measure of stability, but the fundamental currency exchanged for information, making the act of observation an explicit and costly interaction with a system's integrity.

  Adherence Time is a scalar quantity, derived from the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem, that represents the intrinsic resilience of a coherent, rhythmic system to decoherence from environmental noise or observational back-action. It serves as the primary parameter in predicting the stability thresholds and phase transitions of such systems and quantifies the loss of coherence incurred during measurement.

        outline: |
          Measure a system's intrinsic fluctuation spectrum using time-series analysis to calculate baseline T_a via the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem. Concurrently, measure the full spectrum of environmental noise impacting the system. Integrate the measured noise over time until the system's coherence breaks (e.g., a phase transition is observed) and compare the breakdown time to the prediction.

          For an ensemble of identical systems, measure the baseline T_a. Perform a measurement of known strength (κ) to extract a quantity of information I. Re-measure the post-interaction T_a' to find the reduction ΔT_a = T_a - T_a'. Plot the relationship between I and ΔT_a to map the trade-off curve and test against the Information-Coherence Inequality.

        For any resonant or rhythmic system, the Quality factor (Q) is proportional to the characteristic time (τ) over which its energy dissipates.

This mapping is broader than T₂ and applies to both classical and quantum domains.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish Adherence Time (T_a) from thermodynamic Temperature (T) or kinetic energy (T). T_a denotes the temporal *duration* of a system's phase coherence. It is dimensionally a time, conceptually closest to a relaxation or decoherence time (like T₂ in NMR), not a measure of thermal energy.

# Adherence Time

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Adherence Time is a scalar quantity, derived from the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem, that represents the intrinsic resilience of a coherent, rhythmic system to decoherence from environmental noise or observational back-action. It serves as the primary parameter in predicting the stability thresholds and phase transitions of such systems and quantifies the loss of coherence incurred during measurement.

## EFT-First Summary
In analogy with classical resonators, Adherence Time (T_a) is proportional to the system's Quality Factor (Q), representing the characteristic timescale over which coherent oscillations decay due to environmental coupling or dissipation (T_a ∝ Q/ω₀). It is operationally equivalent to decoherence times (e.g., T₂) in quantum systems, providing a unified measure of a system's resilience to phase noise across domains. The framework claims T_a is the fundamental currency exchanged for information during measurement.
