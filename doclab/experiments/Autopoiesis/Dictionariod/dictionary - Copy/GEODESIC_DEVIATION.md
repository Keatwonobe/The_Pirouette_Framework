        Geodesic Deviation (Œ¥G): The primary metric for influence. It is the quantitative difference between a system's observed trajectory and the calculated "null geodesic" it would have followed in an unperturbed coherence manifold.

  art: |
    A measure of a path bent by memory. It is the shadow cast by an alternate history‚Äîthe one that would have been, had the past not been a landscape with its own gravity.
  law: |
    Geodesic Deviation (Œ¥G) is the integrated path difference between an entity's observed worldline and its calculated null geodesic in an unperturbed coherence manifold; it is the definitive measure of the total influence exerted by one or more Wound Channels upon that entity.
  philosophy: |
    Œ¥G makes influence a measurable, geometric quantity, not a statistical abstraction. It quantifies the 'weight of history,' demonstrating that causality is not an external force but the shape of the terrain upon which the present must travel. It is the physical proof that no action is isolated.
pirouette_definition: |
  The primary metric of influence, defined as the quantitative difference between an entity's actual trajectory (worldline) and its theoretical unperturbed path (the null geodesic). This deviation is caused by the geometric curvature of the local coherence manifold, which is sculpted by the Temporal Pressure (V_Œì) of one or more Wound Channels. Œ¥G is the direct, integrated measure of the total causal influence a historical echo exerts over a given interval.

        outline: |
          1. Isolate the entity under study and the source(s) of influence (the Wound Channels).
          2. Record the entity's actual trajectory `x_actual(t)` over a defined interval `[t‚ÇÄ, t‚ÇÅ]`.
          3. Model the local coherence manifold *without* the influence of the source Wound Channel(s) to establish the ambient background.
          4. Calculate the theoretical null geodesic `x_null(t)` the entity would have followed on this unperturbed manifold, given identical initial conditions at `t‚ÇÄ`.
          5. Compute Œ¥G as the time-integrated magnitude of the difference vector: `Œ¥G = ‚à´[t‚ÇÄ, t‚ÇÅ] |x_actual(t) - x_null(t)| dt`.

    excerpt: |
      The "force" of influence is therefore revealed to be the gradient of this potential (`-‚àáV_Œì,channel`), which emerges when applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to `ùìõ_p`. The entity, in obeying the universal Principle of Maximal Coherence, will alter its trajectory‚Äîits geodesic‚Äîto navigate this new, composite landscape.

      justification: |
        The term is a direct analogue to the concept in General Relativity, which measures the relative acceleration of nearby test particles due to spacetime curvature (tidal forces). In Pirouette, it measures the 'acceleration' of a single particle away from its unperturbed path due to the 'curvature' of the coherence manifold induced by a Wound Channel's Temporal Pressure.

    - statement: "The measured Geodesic Deviation (Œ¥G) of an entity is directly proportional to the integrated Temporal Pressure (V_Œì) of the influencing Wound Channel(s) along its path."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "Observation of a non-zero Œ¥G in a region with a demonstrably flat coherence manifold (V_Œì,channel = 0), or a Œ¥G that does not scale with the measured strength of V_Œì."

  disambiguation: |
    While the name and mathematical spirit are borrowed from General Relativity, Œ¥G in Pirouette refers to the deviation of a *single* path from its hypothetical, unperturbed state, not the relative deviation between two nearby paths. The 'curvature' is in the coherence manifold (a landscape of memory), not spacetime itself.
