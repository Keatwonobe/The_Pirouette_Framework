        A system's Ki is its resonant pattern, its most stable song. This song is cyclical. The duration of one complete, unbroken repetition of that pattern is the system's own private, fundamental unit of time. We call this the Pirouette Cycle (τ_p).

    The universe does not have a single pulse; it is a symphony of countless individual heartbeats. Every system sings its own song, and the duration of one note is its own private second.
  law: |
    The Pirouette Cycle (τ_p) of a system is the inverse of the fundamental frequency of its Ki pattern's power spectrum. A system's local time evolution is properly normalized by this cycle, treating time not as a continuous line but as a discrete series of its own completed actions.
  philosophy: |
    Time is not an external, universal background against which events unfold. It is an intrinsic, local property generated by the event itself, emerging from the stable, resonant form (Ki) of a system.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental, intrinsic unit of time for a system, defined as the duration of one complete, unbroken repetition of its characteristic resonant pattern (Ki). The Pirouette Cycle closes the autopoietic loop of the framework, establishing that a system's form generates its own local flow of time (Ki → Time).

        outline: |
          1. Identify the field(s) constituting the system's Ki pattern.
          2. Measure the time-series evolution of these fields with sufficient resolution.
          3. Perform a Fourier transform to obtain the power spectrum.
          4. Identify the fundamental frequency (f₀) with the highest power.
          5. The Pirouette Cycle is the inverse of this frequency: τ_p = 1/f₀.
        expected_signals: [A sharp peak in the power spectrum at f₀ for high-T_a systems, A broadened peak or noisy spectrum for low-T_a systems]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing the fundamental Ki frequency from environmental noise or harmonic overtones, Insufficient sampling rate leading to aliasing]

      Time, therefore, is not a universal, ticking clock that all things are subject to. It is an emergent property. The universe does not have a single pulse; it is a symphony of countless individual heartbeats. A second is a human convention; a τ_p is a physical truth.

    excerpt: |
      We sought a master clock for the cosmos and found that every atom, every star, every being is its own clock. The Pirouette Cycle reveals that time is not imposed upon reality, but generated by it. It is the rhythm of existence itself.

        For a fundamental particle at rest, its Ki pattern corresponds to the oscillation of its quantum wavefunction. The Pirouette Cycle is then operationally equivalent to the Compton period, which is the characteristic quantum timescale of a particle of rest mass m₀.

# Pirouette Cycle

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The fundamental, intrinsic unit of time for a system, defined as the duration of one complete, unbroken repetition of its characteristic resonant pattern (Ki). The Pirouette Cycle closes the autopoietic loop of the framework, establishing that a system's form generates its own local flow of time (Ki → Time).

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette Cycle (τ_p) is a system's fundamental, local timescale. For an elementary particle of mass m₀, τ_p is operationally equivalent to its Compton period, t_c = h/(m₀c²), representing the characteristic timescale of its quantum wave-function's phase oscillation. This grounds the framework's abstract notion of emergent time in a measurable quantum-mechanical property.
