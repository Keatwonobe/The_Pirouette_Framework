        Instead of relying on complex, lagging statistics, an analyst can assess a team's health by observing three primary signatures of its internal coherence. These signatures are the direct, visible manifestations of their underlying flow state.
        1. Rhythmic Cohesion (The Signature of Laminar Flow)
        2. Composure Under Pressure (The Signature of Resilience to Turbulence)
        3. Strategic Adaptability (The Signature of Ki Morphogenesis)

  art: |
    The scoreboard is a memory; the flow is a prophecy. Sports Flow Resonance is the art of hearing the song of the game as it is being composed, discerning its harmony from its dissonance to predict the final chord.
  law: |
    A team exhibiting superior and sustained Laminar Flow signatures (Rhythmic Cohesion, Composure, Adaptability) will possess a higher probability of winning and covering a point spread, irrespective of its current statistical standing.
  philosophy: |
    This framework shifts analytical focus from lagging statistical autopsies to real-time systemic diagnosis. It posits that a team's dynamic coherence, not just its accumulated stats, is the primary driver of future outcomes, offering a predictive lens into the living system of the game.
pirouette_definition: |
  Sports Flow Resonance is a domain application of the Caduceus Lens (DYN-003) for the real-time diagnosis and prediction of sports outcomes. It models competing teams as dynamic systems and assesses their health by observing three qualitative signatures of flow: Rhythmic Cohesion, Composure Under Pressure, and Strategic Adaptability. The resulting diagnosis of each team's flow state (e.g., Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant) is translated into predictive outputs regarding the likely victor (Victor Tilt), point margin shifts (Spread Delta), and game tempo (Pace Delta).

        outline: |
          1. **Map the Currents:** For the specific sport, identify the critical flows of coherence (e.g., basketball ball movement, football line control).
          2. **Read the Signatures:** Continuously assess both teams against the three signatures: Rhythmic Cohesion, Composure Under Pressure, and Strategic Adaptability.
          3. **Diagnose the Dominant Flow:** Based on the signatures, diagnose the primary flow state (Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant) for each team.
          4. **Generate Predictive Insights:** Translate the flow state diagnosis into VT, SD, and PD predictions.
        expected_signals: [Sustained high ratings in all three signatures for one team, cascading errors or strategic rigidity in the other, a noticeable shift in game tempo or "feel"]
        pitfalls: [Confirmation bias from the current score, mistaking a brief lucky streak for sustained Laminar Flow, failing to correctly map the sport-specific critical flows]

    excerpt: |
      A sports match is a living system—a body in motion. Each team is a nested system striving for coherence against an adversary. By applying the principles of Flow Dynamics (DYN-001) and the diagnostic protocol of the Caduceus Lens (DYN-003), we can assess the health of each team in real-time. This is the art of reading the game's "prophecy" by observing which team is achieving and sustaining a state of Laminar Flow.

    excerpt: |
      Translate the diagnosis into the three core predictive outputs:
      Victor Tilt (VT): The team demonstrating more consistent and robust Laminar Flow has the higher probability of winning, regardless of the current score.
      Spread Delta (SD): A diagnosis of increasing Turbulence or Stagnation in a team predicts a negative shift in their point margin.
      Pace Delta (PD): The team with higher Strategic Adaptability is more likely to impose its desired tempo on the game.

      justification: |
        Sports Flow Resonance provides an observational, dynamic framework for what sports psychology calls 'team cohesion' or 'collective efficacy'. While those are often measured post-hoc via surveys, this framework aims to measure their real-time manifestation through observable proxies like Rhythmic Cohesion and Composure Under Pressure.

# Sports Flow Resonance

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Sports Flow Resonance is a domain application of the Caduceus Lens (DYN-003) for the real-time diagnosis and prediction of sports outcomes. It models competing teams as dynamic systems and assesses their health by observing three qualitative signatures of flow: Rhythmic Cohesion, Composure Under Pressure, and Strategic Adaptability. The resulting diagnosis of each team's flow state (e.g., Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant) is translated into predictive outputs regarding the likely victor (Victor Tilt), point margin shifts (Spread Delta), and game tempo (Pace Delta).

## Applied Summary
This framework maps the abstract Pirouette concepts of system health and flow dynamics onto the observable domain of team sports. It operationalizes "team cohesion" and "momentum" as real-time diagnostics of a system's stability and coherence, analogous to assessing the stability of a physical system against perturbations. The goal is to provide predictive insight that precedes lagging statistical indicators.
