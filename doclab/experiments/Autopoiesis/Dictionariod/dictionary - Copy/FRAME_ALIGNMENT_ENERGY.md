triad:
  art: |
    The energy of a string stretched taut between two tuning forks; a resonant hum that seeks silence. It is the cost of dissonance between the temporal triad and the hypercharge clock.
  law: |
    The potential energy density penalizing misalignment between the SU(2)ʟ triad and U(1)ʏ clock frames is a positive-definite function `Vₐₗᵢgₙ(H) = α₀|H|² + β|H|⁴`, where `α₀ > 0` and `β > 0` are determined by the frame stiffnesses (`g`, `g'`) and the coherence barrier scale `ω_c`. This energy actively resists electroweak symmetry breaking.
  philosophy: |
    This energy represents the system's intrinsic preference for coherence and simplicity (manifested as `H=0`). Spontaneous symmetry breaking is not an inherent instability but the result of this preference being overwhelmed by a stronger, external force—Temporal Pressure (Γ). Frame-alignment Energy is the conservative force of order.
pirouette_definition: |
  The component of the Higgs potential, `Vₐₗᵢgₙ`, that provides the positive-definite quadratic curvature (`α₀|H|²`, `α₀>0`) and quartic stability term (`β|H|⁴`, `β>0`). It originates from the intrinsic stiffnesses (`K₂=1/g²`, `K₁=1/g'²`) of the SU(2)ʟ triad and U(1)ʏ clock frames, representing the energy cost of their misalignment, which is parameterized by the Higgs field `H`. This energy is overcome by the negative pressure from the Γ-field to induce electroweak symmetry breaking.

          The components of `Vₐₗᵢgₙ` are not directly measured but are inferred from Higgs observables within the Pirouette model.
          1. Measure the Higgs mass `m_H` and vacuum expectation value `v`.
          2. Calculate the quartic term `β = m_H² / (2v²)`. This directly measures the alignment anharmonicity.
          3. Measure precision Higgs couplings and width (`Γ_H`) to constrain the Γ-coupling `λ_HΓ` and background `⟨Γ²⟩`.
          4. Reconstruct the bare positive curvature `α₀` using the relation `α₀ = α(Γ) + λ_HΓ⟨Γ²⟩`, where `α(Γ) = -βv² = -m_H²/2`. A positive `α₀` is a required outcome.

        Frame-alignment Energy corresponds to the positive-definite parts of the Standard Model Higgs potential before symmetry breaking. The quartic term `β|H|⁴` maps directly to the SM `λ|H|⁴` term. The quadratic term `α₀|H|²` corresponds to a *positive* bare mass-squared term (`μ₀² > 0`). In Pirouette, the observed negative mass-squared of the SM arises from subtracting the Temporal Pressure effect: `μ²_eff = -(α₀ - λ_HΓ⟨Γ²⟩)`.

  disambiguation: |
    "Frame-alignment Energy" refers specifically to the positive-definite potential `α₀|H|² + β|H|⁴` that *resists* symmetry breaking. It should not be confused with the full, effective Higgs potential `V(H)`, whose quadratic term `α(Γ)|H|²` can become negative due to Temporal Pressure, thereby *causing* symmetry breaking. This energy is the barrier, not the force that breaks the barrier.

# Frame-alignment Energy

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Frame-alignment Energy is the component of the Higgs potential, `Vₐₗᵢgₙ`, that provides the positive-definite quadratic curvature (`α₀|H|²`, `α₀>0`) and quartic stability term (`β|H|⁴`, `β>0`). It originates from the intrinsic stiffnesses (`K₂=1/g²`, `K₁=1/g'²`) of the SU(2)ʟ triad and U(1)ʏ clock frames, representing the energy cost of their misalignment, which is parameterized by the Higgs field `H`. This energy is overcome by the negative pressure from the Γ-field to induce electroweak symmetry breaking.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of the Standard Model effective potential, `V(H) = μ²|H|² + λ|H|⁴`, the Frame-alignment Energy provides the physical origin for a positive bare mass-squared term (`μ₀² > 0`, from Pirouette's `α₀`) and the stabilizing quartic coupling (`λ > 0`, from Pirouette's `β`). The observed negative mass-squared of the Higgs field (`μ² < 0`) is not fundamental but emerges when the positive `α₀` is overwhelmed by a negative contribution from another field (`-λ_HΓ⟨Γ²⟩`), a process called "temporal-pressure softening" in Pirouette. Therefore, the Frame-alignment Energy is the force that stabilizes the electroweak vacuum and resists symmetry breaking.
