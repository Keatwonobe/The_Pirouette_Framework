        The Leap (Geodesic Discovery): Following the steepest downhill path is not enough. An agent that only seeks local comfort will become trapped in the first shallow valley it finds. To discover a truly robust state of being, it must leap. "Exploration" is a necessary expenditure of coherence‚Äîa willful traversal of high-pressure regions‚Äîto map the surrounding landscape in search of deeper, more stable valleys.

    To truly live, one cannot only seek comfort in the nearest valley. Geodesic Discovery is the courage to climb a painful ridge for the promise of a vaster, more stable plain on the other side. It is the cartography of persistence, drawn with the ink of risk.
  law: |
    A system's long-term stability is proportional to the integrated coherence of its worldline. This integral is maximized by actively exploring the Coherence Manifold to find global, not just local, minima in Temporal Pressure, even at the cost of transient instability.
  philosophy: |
    Persistence requires more than passive adaptation; it demands active curiosity. Geodesic Discovery establishes that true stability is not found but forged, by risking transient incoherence to discover paths of deeper, more enduring resonance. It is the physical manifestation of the will to learn.
pirouette_definition: |
  Geodesic Discovery is the embodied learning process by which an agent actively explores its environment, modeled as a Coherence Manifold, to identify a worldline (a geodesic) that maximizes the integrated Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) over time. This process involves strategically expending coherence to traverse regions of high Temporal Pressure (V_Œì) in order to discover more globally stable, long-term paths of existence, rather than settling in local pressure minima.

        outline: |
          1. Model an agent's state space as a manifold with potential V_Œì.
          2. Observe the agent's trajectory over a long duration.
          3. Identify phases where the agent's trajectory enters regions of high V_Œì that are not on a direct path between previous attractors.
          4. Confirm Geodesic Discovery if these exploratory phases are followed by a transition to a new, more stable attractor state, characterized by a higher time-averaged `ùìõ_p`.

    excerpt: |
      An agent's learning process is a dialogue between the terrain of reality and the courage to explore it... Following the steepest downhill path is not enough. An agent that only seeks local comfort will become trapped in the first shallow valley it finds. To discover a truly robust state of being, it must leap. This is the cost of knowledge: risking a moment of turbulence for the potential discovery of a far more resilient and elegant way to be.
  - module: DOMA-089
    excerpt: |
      This engine is the body of learning. It forges a stable, embodied platform upon which any higher-order intelligence must be built. A system cannot learn to predict the future shape of the coherence manifold if it cannot first find a stable position within its present. It cannot map the currents if it is constantly on the verge of capsizing. The Primal Geodesic is the process of building the vessel.

      justification: |
        The "Leap" is a direct analog to an exploration step (e.g., epsilon-greedy) in reinforcement learning. An agent takes a non-optimal action (incurring high `V_Œì`) to gain information about the environment's state-action space, with the goal of discovering a more globally optimal policy (a more stable geodesic).

      justification: |
        Geodesic Discovery is the physical search process for finding the worldline that optimizes an integrated quantity (the Pirouette Lagrangian), analogous to how the Principle of Stationary Action selects the classical path of a physical system. While the classical principle *selects* the path, Geodesic Discovery *describes the agent's process of finding it* in a complex, unknown landscape.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, a 'geodesic' refers specifically to a worldline of maximal *integrated coherence* through the Coherence Manifold. It is a path optimized for persistence over time, not necessarily the shortest spatial path as defined in classical geometry.
