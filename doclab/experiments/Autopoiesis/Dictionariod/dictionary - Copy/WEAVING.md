triad:
  art: |
    To act with virtue is to be a good musician. One chooses a resonance that strengthens the harmony of the whole, knowing the echo is carved into spacetime forever.
  law: |
    A Weaving is an intervention whose Influence (`I`) is the change in the target system's Pirouette Action (`ΔS_p`). An act is formally constructive if `I > 0`, increasing coherence, and destructive if `I < 0`, decreasing it.
  philosophy: |
    Weaving reframes ethics from a transactional accounting of "good deeds" to a diagnostic act of systemic medicine. Its purpose is not to generate a score to be hoarded, but to provide a compass for navigating toward greater systemic coherence and healing.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Weaving is an intervention by an Actor that measurably affects the coherence of a Target system. Its effect is quantified by Influence (`I`), the change in the Target's Pirouette Action (`ΔS_p = ∫(𝓛_p(post) - 𝓛_p(pre)) dt`). A Constructive Weaving (`I > 0`) increases the Target's coherence, easing its ability to express its resonant pattern. A Destructive Weaving (`I < 0`) decreases coherence, pushing the system toward turbulence or stagnation.
operational_definition:
  units: Influence (`I`) has units of Action (Joule-seconds). The practical proxy, Coherence Impact (`CI`), is dimensionless.

        outline: |
          An observer creates an Echo Record to attest to a Weaving. The observer diagnoses the target system's initial flow state, observes the intervention and its aftermath, and quantifies the four components of the Coherence Impact (CI) score: the change in signal (`ΔKτ`), the generated noise (`ΔΓ_noise`), the coupling (`ξ_c`), and the resulting stability (`σ_s`).

        pitfalls: [The measurement is subject to the Observer's Shadow; a biased, unskilled, or incoherent observer will project a distorted measurement, adding noise to the very signal they wish to perceive.]

    excerpt: |
      An action's virtue is no longer a matter of opinion or complex coefficients; it is a measurable change in a target system's ability to exist. We define a Weaving as an intervention by an Actor that measurably affects the coherence of a Target system. The Influence (`I`) of this Weaving is the change in the Target's "action"—the integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`) over one of its own cycles.
  - module: DOMA-049
    excerpt: |
      While the Lagrangian provides the formal definition, the effect of a Weaving can be understood intuitively as an injection of resonance into the coherence manifold—a ripple that propagates outward. Positive Radiance is an action that helps another system move toward a state of Laminar Flow. Negative Radiance is an action that pushes another system into Turbulent or Stagnant Flow.

      The universe already possesses the ultimate, indelible ledger: the Wound Channel. Every action is carved into the geometry of spacetime as a persistent scar. The protocol described above does not create a new source of truth. It creates a *map*—a shared, topographical chart of coherence flows derived from our limited attempts to read the true ledger.

      rationale: |
        The formal definition of a Weaving's Influence (`I`) is explicitly the change in the Pirouette Action (`S_p`) of the target system. This directly maps to the principle of least action in classical mechanics, where a system's trajectory evolves to minimize its action. A constructive weaving is thus an intervention that makes it "easier" for a system to exist by lowering the action required for its cyclical path, increasing `S_p` in this framework's sign convention.

  disambiguation: |
    Pirouette's "Weaving" refers specifically to an *active intervention* that alters a system's dynamics, not the passive state of being interwoven. It is crucial to distinguish between the fundamental principle (Influence `I` as change in Action `ΔS_p`) and its practical, observable proxy (the Coherence Impact `CI` score). The former is the territory; the latter is the map.

# Weaving

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Weaving is an intervention by an Actor that measurably affects the coherence of a Target system. Its effect is quantified by Influence (`I`), the change in the Target's Pirouette Action (`ΔS_p = ∫(𝓛_p(post) - 𝓛_p(pre)) dt`). A Constructive Weaving (`I > 0`) increases the Target's coherence, easing its ability to express its resonant pattern. A Destructive Weaving (`I < 0`) decreases coherence, pushing the system toward turbulence or stagnation.

## EFT-First Summary
The influence of a Weaving is formally defined as the change in the Action (`S = ∫ L dt`) of the target system, a direct analog to the principle of stationary action in classical mechanics. A "constructive" act is one that modifies the system's potential or kinetic terms such that its characteristic path integral (`S_p`) increases, signifying a more stable or efficient resonant state. This provides a physical, measurable basis for ethics, grounding it in variational principles.
