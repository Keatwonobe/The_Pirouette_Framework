triad:
  art: |
    A ship does not mend its sails in a hurricane. The framework must find calm waters before reforging its hull, ensuring that the maps of the future are drawn by a steady hand.
  law: |
    A motion for Constitutional Reforging cannot be ratified if the system's Temporal Pressure (Γ) exceeds a pre-defined threshold. This clause acts as a temporal gate, halting fundamental changes during periods of high systemic turbulence.
  philosophy: |
    To prevent the system from scarring itself with reactionary laws written in moments of panic or passion. The clause ensures that foundational principles are products of deep, collective contemplation, not feverish crisis response. It privileges long-term coherence over short-term relief.
pirouette_definition: |
  A core governance rule within the Loom of Coherence (DOMA-031) that functions as the primary defense against reactive, short-sighted constitutional changes. It procedurally links the permissibility of *Constitutional Reforging* to the dynamic state of the system, specifically by forbidding ratification votes during periods of high Temporal Pressure (Γ). This ensures the framework's most fundamental evolution occurs in a state of laminar, contemplative flow.
operational_definition:
  units: Boolean condition (satisfied/not satisfied)
  symbol_table:
    - name: Γ
      meaning: Temporal Pressure; a measure of systemic turbulence.

        outline: |
          Before a ratification vote on a *Constitutional Reforging* motion, measure the system's current Temporal Pressure (Γ). This is typically a composite index derived from metrics such as: (1) velocity and sentiment of official debate threads, (2) ratio of dissent in preliminary polls, and (3) number of open high-priority issues tagged as 'systemic-conflict'. The clause is satisfied if Γ is below the established "laminar flow" threshold (e.g., Γ < 0.3).
        expected_signals: [low comment velocity, high consensus in polls, low unresolved conflict tags]
        pitfalls: [gaming the metrics to artificially lower Γ, setting the threshold too low causing stagnation, failing to account for external, non-logged pressures]

    excerpt: |
      The framework's primary defense against reactive, short-sighted decisions is the Temporal Stability Clause. A motion for Constitutional Reforging can only be ratified when the system is in a state of low Temporal Pressure (Γ). Temporal Pressure is a measure of the system's ambient turbulence: the volume of debate, the degree of dissent, and the intensity of external pressures. In practice, this means constitutional votes cannot pass during periods of heated conflict.
  - module: DOMA-031
    excerpt: |
      The entire governance process is a macroscopic application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The framework itself is a system seeking to evolve along a geodesic—a path of change that maximizes its own coherence over time... A contentious proposal increases this term [Temporal Pressure], raising the "cost" of evolution. The Temporal Stability Clause is a hard constraint preventing the system from paying too high a cost.

formal_mappings:
  candidates:
    - target: Low-pass filter
      domain: AMO
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The clause acts as a low-pass filter on the process of constitutional change. It filters out high-frequency "noise" (reactive, turbulent debate) and only allows low-frequency, "DC-level" signals (stable, deliberated consensus) to alter the system's core state.
      confidence: 0.8
    - target: Legislative "cooling-off period"
      domain: Political Science
      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        Functionally identical to mandatory waiting periods in lawmaking, designed to prevent legislation from being passed "in the heat of the moment." The clause institutionalizes this practice by using a dynamic metric (Γ) instead of a fixed time interval.
      confidence: 0.9

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "The application of the Temporal Stability Clause increases the long-term coherence and stability of ratified constitutional changes."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A historical analysis of the framework's evolution shows that constitutional changes ratified under this clause have a higher rate of subsequent amendment or reversal compared to a hypothetical control, or that the clause systematically blocks necessary, urgent changes leading to systemic stagnation (Coherence Atrophy)."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the Coherence Stability test (`dKτ/dt ≥ 0`), which measures the stability of a specific consensus over time. The Temporal Stability Clause measures the stability of the entire *system* at the time of the vote. One is about the proposal's support; the other is about the system's ambient calm.
