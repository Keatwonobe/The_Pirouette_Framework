    The unchanging rules of motion on a stage woven from the rhythm of time's own unfolding. A τ-isometry is a pirouette within the substrate that leaves the fabric of causality, the emergent spacetime, perfectly undisturbed.
  law: |
    A transformation of the substrate fields is a τ-isometry if and only if it preserves the cycle-averaged Hessian metric, \(g_{\mu\nu}=\langle\partial_\mu\Gamma\,\partial_\nu\Gamma-\partial_\mu Ki\,\partial_\nu Ki^{*}\rangle_\tau\). The group of all such transformations is the Lorentz group, SO(1,3).
  philosophy: |
    The τ-isometry establishes Lorentz invariance as a derived symmetry of the substrate action, not a fundamental postulate. This grounds the principles of special relativity in the deeper, time-first ontology of the Pirouette Framework, explaining *why* the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers.
pirouette_definition: |
  A τ-isometry is a symmetry transformation of the fundamental substrate fields (Ki, Γ) that preserves the emergent spacetime metric, \(g_{\mu\nu}\). This metric is defined as the second variation of the cycle-averaged substrate action \(S_p\) with respect to spacetime coordinates. The set of all τ-isometries forms the group SO(1,3), which is mathematically identical to the Lorentz group, thereby ensuring the Euler-Lagrange equations of the framework are Lorentz-covariant.

          1. Prepare a system of particles (e.g., muons) in a high-coherence vacuum state.
          2. Accelerate the particles to a range of relativistic velocities \(v\) relative to the laboratory frame.
          3. Measure a Lorentz-dependent observable, such as the mean particle lifetime or scattering cross-section, as a function of \(v\).
          4. Verify that the measurements conform to the predictions of Special Relativity, transformed by the τ-isometry group (i.e., Lorentz transformations).
        expected_signals:
          - Particle lifetimes scale with the Lorentz factor γ, \(t' = γt\).
          - Energy-momentum relations follow \(E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2\).
          - The invariant speed \(c\) matches the value derived from the Γ-potential stiffness.
        pitfalls:
          - Misinterpreting environmental decoherence effects as fundamental Lorentz violation.
          - Failure to account for background Γ-field gradients, which could induce apparent variations in \(c\).

    The 'τ' in τ-Isometry refers to the internal, periodic substrate parameter over which the action is averaged to obtain the emergent metric. It is the 'clock' of the substrate, not the proper time of a worldline. The isometry itself is a transformation on the emergent spacetime coordinates (t, x, y, z), not on τ.

# τ-Isometry

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A τ-isometry is a symmetry transformation of the fundamental substrate fields (Ki, Γ) that preserves the emergent spacetime metric, \(g_{\mu\nu}\). This metric is defined as the second variation of the cycle-averaged substrate action \(S_p\) with respect to spacetime coordinates. The set of all τ-isometries forms the group SO(1,3), which is mathematically identical to the Lorentz group, thereby ensuring the Euler-Lagrange equations of the framework are Lorentz-covariant.

## EFT-First Summary
The τ-Isometry is the Pirouette Framework's name for a Lorentz transformation. Instead of being postulated, Lorentz symmetry is derived from the dynamics of a more fundamental substrate. The group of these transformations is proven to be SO(1,3), meaning that all standard results of Special Relativity, such as time dilation and the invariance of the speed of light, are recovered as emergent properties. (Ref: A. Einstein, *Ann. Phys.*, 1905).
