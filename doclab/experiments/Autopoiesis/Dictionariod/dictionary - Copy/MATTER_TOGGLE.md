        Γ-matter toggle (production geometry correction).
        We model small matter/production effects by a bounded adjustment to column adherence:
        $$ T'_{a,i} = T_{a,i}\,[1 + \epsilon\,\Gamma\,(T_{a,i} - \overline{T_a})], \quad \epsilon=0.1,\; \Gamma\in\{0,0.5,1\}. $$

  art: |
    A neutrino's identity is not forged in a vacuum, but subtly colored by the forge itself. Γ is the tint of its birthplace, a whisper of matter's influence on its geometric form.
  law: |
    The Γ-matter toggle is a dimensionless parameter (Γ ∈ {0, 0.5, 1}) that models environmental effects on neutrino production by applying a bounded, contrast-enhancing adjustment to the geometric properties that determine mass. Γ=0 corresponds to vacuum, Γ=0.5 to terrestrial reactors, and Γ=1 to dense stellar cores.
  philosophy: |
    Γ operationalizes the Knot Hypothesis, asserting that fundamental properties are not immutable but can be conditioned by their environment. It serves as a bridge between the abstract geometry of the Prime Resonance Manifold and concrete, measurable variations in neutrino observables from different sources.
pirouette_definition: |
  A discrete, dimensionless parameter representing the strength of environmental coupling on neutrino production geometry. It modifies a neutrino's internal structural parameters (column adherence, Tₐ) via a contrast-enhancing transform, `T' = T[1 + εΓ(T - T̄)]`. This models the hypothesis that neutrinos produced in different environments (e.g., vacuum Γ=0, reactors Γ=0.5, stellar cores Γ=1) exist as distinct "knots" on the Prime Resonance Manifold, leading to small, predictable shifts in their absolute masses and derived observables.

        outline: |
          1. Use a direct measurement experiment (e.g., KATRIN-style) to determine the absolute neutrino mass scale (e.g., m_β) for terrestrial sources like tritium decay (effective Γ≈0.5).
          2. Independently determine the absolute mass scale from cosmological observations or future high-precision solar neutrino experiments (effective Γ≈1).
          3. A statistically significant difference between these measurements, consistent in magnitude and sign with the predictions from the Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law, would constitute a measurement of the Γ effect.
        expected_signals: [A shift in the summed neutrino mass Σm of ~0.14 mg/eV from Γ=0 to Γ=1, or a shift in m_β of ~0.0001 eV.]
        pitfalls: [Systematic errors in absolute mass measurements that exceed the predicted effect size, unaccounted-for matter effects during propagation (MSW) that could mimic a production effect.]

    excerpt: |
      Environmental Knot Variation: It is predicted that neutrinos produced in different physical environments (e.g., the core of the Sun, a terrestrial reactor, a supernova) may exist as different knots on the manifold. While their oscillation behavior would be identical, their absolute masses could be subtly different. This could potentially be detected by future experiments capable of measuring the absolute neutrino mass with extreme precision.

      Γ-matter toggle (production geometry correction). We model small matter/production effects by a bounded adjustment to column adherence:

      This increases/decreases adherence contrast around the column mean without changing ordering-agnostic structure.

        Γ models an environmental modification to a particle's properties at its point of creation. This is conceptually similar to how fields in an Effective Field Theory acquire an "in-medium" effective mass due to interactions with a background. However, Γ acts on the geometric precursors to mass rather than the mass term directly, representing a novel production-locus effect.

  disambiguation: |
    This Γ is a discrete, dimensionless parameter representing environmental conditions at the point of particle production, not a continuous variable representing decay rate (width). It modifies the inputs to the mass law, not the particle's lifetime. It should also be distinguished from the gamma matrices (γ^μ) of the Dirac equation.

# Γ-matter toggle

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A discrete, dimensionless parameter representing the strength of environmental coupling on neutrino production geometry. It modifies a neutrino's internal structural parameters (column adherence, Tₐ) via a contrast-enhancing transform, `T' = T[1 + εΓ(T - T̄)]`. This models the hypothesis that neutrinos produced in different environments (e.g., vacuum Γ=0, reactors Γ=0.5, stellar cores Γ=1) exist as distinct "knots" on the Prime Resonance Manifold, leading to small, predictable shifts in their absolute masses and derived observables.

## EFT-First Summary
The Γ-matter toggle is a novel parameter within the Pirouette Framework with no direct analogue in the Standard Model. It functions conceptually like an "in-medium" correction within an Effective Field Theory, where the background environment (e.g., a stellar core) modifies a particle's fundamental properties at the point of production. However, unlike standard EFT corrections that adjust mass or coupling terms, Γ adjusts the underlying geometric parameters that are hypothesized to generate mass.
