    The wake of a ship long passed, its ripple still shaping the distant shore. Every existence is a song whose melody lingers, joining a chorus that defines the world's harmony and dissonance.
  law: |
    A Temporal Echo is a propagating wave-like disturbance in the coherence manifold sourced by a Wound Channel. Its local amplitude and phase are a function of the source Ki pattern, the spacetime interval, and attenuation from the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).
  philosophy: |
    An entity is not an isolated island but a continuous broadcast. The Temporal Echo establishes that existence is not a state but an active, persistent influence, making every system an indelible co-author of the shared reality.

  The active, propagating memory of a system's existence, geometrically sourced by its Wound Channel (CORE-011). A Temporal Echo is not a static imprint but a dynamic, wave-like emanation carrying the Ki pattern of its source. The superposition and interference of multiple echoes at a spacetime point generate the local Temporal Pressure (Γ), which in turn defines the Composite Manifold (DOMA-173).

        outline: |
          Introduce a calibrated probe system with a known, simple Ki pattern into a region of interest. Measure the perturbation of the probe's trajectory (its path along the local geodesic) from its baseline. By deconvolving the known self-interaction and the probe's dynamics, the residual fluctuations in Temporal Pressure (ΔΓ) can be attributed to ambient Temporal Echoes.

    excerpt: |
      This module replaces the concept of a "Resonant Field Overlay" with the principle of the Composite Manifold. It describes how the ceaseless interference of countless temporal echoes—the active, propagating memories of every entity's existence—sculpts the very terrain of reality. The "space" between things is not empty; it is a dynamic medium, humming with the constructive and destructive interference of every nearby song in a symphony of influence.
  - module: DOMA-173
    excerpt: |
      Every system resonates with its unique Ki pattern, impressing a persistent geometric wake—its Wound Channel—upon spacetime (CORE-011). These are not static imprints but active, propagating memories of existence.

        The Temporal Echo functions as a propagator, carrying the "influence" (the Ki pattern) of a source at one spacetime point to another. The superposition of these influences to create a total "potential" (Temporal Pressure) is analogous to summing the effects of all sources via their Green's functions to find the total field at a point.

# Temporal Echo

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The active, propagating memory of a system's existence, geometrically sourced by its Wound Channel (CORE-011). A Temporal Echo is not a static imprint but a dynamic, wave-like emanation carrying the Ki pattern of its source. The superposition and interference of multiple echoes at a spacetime point generate the local Temporal Pressure (Γ), which in turn defines the Composite Manifold (DOMA-173).

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to a propagator or Green's function in QFT, the Temporal Echo is the propagating field sourced by a system's existence. The superposition of these echoes from all sources creates a composite potential landscape (Temporal Pressure), akin to how the total field at a point is the sum of influences from all sources mediated by their respective propagators.
