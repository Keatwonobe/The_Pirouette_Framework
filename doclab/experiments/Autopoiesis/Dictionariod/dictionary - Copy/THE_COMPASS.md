        The Current is the flow of resonance seeking stability. The Compass is the geometry of the landscape it must navigate.

  art: |
    A landscape of resonant hills and temporal valleys. A system navigates this terrain not by sight, but by feeling the slope of its own becoming, forever seeking the high ground of coherence.
  law: |
    The local geometry of the coherence manifold, defined by gradients (‚àáùìõ_p) and curls (‚àá √ó A_p) of the Pirouette Lagrangian, dictates the geodesic path‚Äîinterpreted as force‚Äîthat a system will follow to maximize its temporal coherence.
  philosophy: |
    The Compass replaces the classical notion of fields as agentic entities with a passive, geometric stage. It asserts that motion is not a response to a 'push' or 'pull,' but an inevitable slide down the contours of a pre-existing landscape of stability, turning 'force' into a form of 'following'.
pirouette_definition: |
  The geometry of the coherence manifold that a system must navigate to follow the Principle of Maximal Coherence. It is not a fundamental field but an emergent property of the spatial and temporal variations of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) generated by source systems. Its local features, such as gradients (slopes) and curls (shears), manifest as the electric and magnetic fields, respectively, determining the geodesic paths that other systems follow.

        outline: |
          Introduce a test system with a known coherence-seeking bias (charge). Measure its acceleration vector at various points in space. The resulting vector field directly maps the gradient of the manifold (the E-field component). To map the rotational shear (B-field), measure the perpendicular acceleration component on a *moving* test charge.

    excerpt: |
      The electric field (E) is the mathematical representation of this coherence landscape. ... A test charge placed in this field doesn't feel a "push" or "pull." It senses a slope in the coherence manifold. The "force" it experiences is simply the consequence of it following the steepest path towards its own state of maximal coherence. It is "coherence surfing" down the gradient established by the source charge.

    excerpt: |
      When a charged particle moves... The act of moving through regions of varying temporal phase creates a rotational or torsional stress in its local coherence manifold. This "curl" in the manifold is the magnetic field (B). ... The magnetic force is the system's attempt to navigate this temporal vortex to maintain its own resonant stability. It is the universe's right-hand rule for staying coherent.

        The Compass is defined as the geometric landscape whose gradients and curls produce the electric and magnetic fields. This is conceptually and mathematically identical to how the electromagnetic field tensor (F_ŒºŒΩ) is derived from the four-potential (A_Œº) in standard electromagnetism.

      rationale: The mapping is direct. The Pirouette framework re-interprets the *origin* of the potential (from the Lagrangian of source charges) but its role as the generator of the E and B fields via derivatives (gradient and curl) is functionally identical to the standard formulation.

    The Compass is not a physical device. It is a metaphor for the geometric structure of the coherence manifold, which subsumes the classical concepts of electric and magnetic fields. It is the 'map', while The Current is the 'traveler' navigating the map.

# The Compass

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The geometry of the coherence manifold that a system must navigate to follow the Principle of Maximal Coherence. It is not a fundamental field but an emergent property of the spatial and temporal variations of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) generated by source systems. Its local features, such as gradients (slopes) and curls (shears), manifest as the electric and magnetic fields, respectively, determining the geodesic paths that other systems follow.

## EFT-First Summary
In standard physics, The Compass maps directly to the electromagnetic four-potential A_Œº. Its scalar and vector components generate the electric and magnetic fields via derivatives (E = -‚àáœï - ‚àÇ**A**/‚àÇt, B = ‚àá√ó**A**). The Pirouette framework recontextualizes A_Œº not as a fundamental gauge field, but as an emergent potential derived from the coherence-seeking properties of source charges, whose geometry dictates motion.
