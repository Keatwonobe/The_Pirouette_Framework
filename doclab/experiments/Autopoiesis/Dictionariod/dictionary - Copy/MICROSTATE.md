        The Pirouette Framework redefines the microstate. A microstate is not a configuration in physical space, but a resonant mode in the coherence manifold.

  art: |
    A single, fleeting note in the universe's song. An individual mode of resonance that, when combined with others, creates fleeting islands of order in a vast ocean of probabilistic states.
  law: |
    Any single, accessible resonant mode within a system's coherence manifold is a discrete microstate. In an isolated system at equilibrium, every accessible microstate is equally probable. The total number of such states is Ω.
  philosophy: |
    By redefining the fundamental 'state' from a spatial arrangement of particles to a resonant mode, the framework grounds thermodynamics and the arrow of time in the more primary dynamics of coherence and its dissipation.
pirouette_definition: |
  In the Pirouette Framework, a microstate is a single, specific, and discrete resonant mode accessible to a system within its coherence manifold. This redefines the term from its classical statistical mechanics meaning of a specific configuration of particle positions and momenta. The total number of accessible microstates (Ω) for a system directly determines its entropy (S = k_B * ln(Ω)) and its capacity to interact with ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).

      meaning: The total number of accessible microstates (resonant modes) for a given macrostate.

        outline: |
          A single microstate is not directly observed. The total number of microstates (Ω) is inferred from macroscopic thermodynamic quantities. Measure the system's entropy (S) via standard calorimetry and then calculate Ω using the Boltzmann relation, Ω = exp(S/k_B).
        expected_signals: [A stable entropy value (S) for a system in equilibrium.]
        pitfalls: [Inaccurate entropy measurements, especially in non-equilibrium systems where the set of accessible microstates is not well-defined.]

    excerpt: |
      The Pirouette Framework redefines the microstate. A microstate is not a configuration in physical space, but a resonant mode in the coherence manifold. Omega is therefore the total number of resonant modes available to a system and its environment. A Low-Entropy System (e.g., a crystal): Has a high degree of internal coherence (K_tau). Its resonance is confined to a very small number of specific, ordered modes.
  - module: MATH-003
    excerpt: |
      The fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics is that all accessible microstates are equally probable. The combined system will therefore tend to evolve towards the macroscopic state that has the largest number of possible microscopic arrangements.

      justification: |
        The Pirouette microstate is a direct conceptual replacement for the classical microstate (a point in phase space). While the physical referent changes from particle configurations to resonant modes, its formal role in the Boltzmann entropy equation and the postulate of equal a priori probability is identical.

      rationale: The framework explicitly redefines this foundational concept from statistical mechanics to ground it in coherence dynamics rather than particle kinetics. The mapping is definitional.

  claims:
    - statement: "The number of accessible resonant modes in a system's coherence manifold (Ω_Pirouette) is rigorously equal to the number of microstates calculated from its measured thermodynamic entropy (Ω_thermo = exp(S/k_B))."
      domain: theory|experiment
      falsifier: "An experiment where the spectrum of coherence resonances is directly measured and the count of modes does not match the value of Ω calculated from the system's measured entropy. This would sever the proposed link between coherence dynamics and thermodynamics."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol Ω (Omega) for the count of microstates is standard, but can be confused with the ohm, the unit of electrical resistance.]
  disambiguation: |
    A Pirouette microstate is a mode of *resonance*, not a spatial arrangement of particles. For a hot gas, the classical microstates are the positions/momenta of all atoms; the Pirouette microstates are the collective, chaotic resonant modes available to the gas as a whole.
