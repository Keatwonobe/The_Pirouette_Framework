    The hum of a system singing its own song. It is the internal harmony that, when loud enough, tells the universe it is here and bends the local rules of spacetime to its will.
  law: |
    A system's local Temporal Pressure (Γ) is the sum of the ambient pressure and a term functionally dependent on its Resonant Intensity. All else being equal, an increase in a system's K_τ results in a measurable, non-linear increase in the local confinement potential.
  philosophy: |
    Resonant Intensity establishes that 'to be' is not merely to occupy space, but to actively participate in defining the laws of that space. It is the source of a system's agency and the mathematical basis for its integrity and coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  Resonant Intensity (K_τ) is a scalar quantity representing the degree of a system's internal coherence or self-resonance. Mathematically, it is a functional of the system's state variables (φ) and their derivatives (φ_dot), `K_τ(φ, φ_dot)`. It serves as the primary input to the scale-dependent feedback law that dynamically modifies local Temporal Pressure (Γ), thereby giving rise to confinement forces.

      We will formalize the feedback mechanism where a system's own resonant intensity (K_tau) alters its local Temporal Pressure (Gamma). By expanding this relationship, we will prove that the effective potential V(r) naturally takes the form a/r + b*r, and from this, the Gladiator's core behaviors emerge as mathematical theorems.

      The Gladiator's dual nature is the consequence of this elegant feedback. At close range, where the system's components are in a state of high mutual coherence, the leash is slack... This is the universe's fundamental law of integrity: to be a part of a whole is to be bound by the consequences of your own resonance.

        In QCD, the non-perturbative gluon condensate `<G²>` sets the fundamental scale Λ_QCD and is responsible for the string tension (linear term) in the quark-antiquark potential. K_τ plays an analogous role as the internal system property that sources this linear confinement potential via the feedback law. It represents the system's net contribution to the local field energy density.

# Resonant Intensity

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Resonant Intensity (K_τ) is a scalar quantity representing the degree of a system's internal coherence or self-resonance. Mathematically, it is a functional of the system's state variables (φ) and their derivatives (φ_dot), `K_τ(φ, φ_dot)`. It serves as the primary input to the scale-dependent feedback law that dynamically modifies local Temporal Pressure (Γ), thereby giving rise to confinement forces.

## EFT-First Summary
In an analogy to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Resonant Intensity (K_τ) is conceptually mapped to the gluon condensate (`<G²>`). It functions as a measure of the internal, non-perturbative field energy of a composite particle (like a hadron) that sources the linear confinement potential responsible for holding its constituents together. A higher K_τ corresponds to a stronger confining 'string tension'.
