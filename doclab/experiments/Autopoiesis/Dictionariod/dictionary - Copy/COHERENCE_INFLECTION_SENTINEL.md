        The Coherence Inflection Sentinel is a universal early-warning system designed to detect the subtle decay in a system's internal rhythm that precedes a major systemic state change, or *Ki Morphogenesis* event.

  art: |
    A system’s song begins to falter long before its structure breaks. The Sentinel is an instrument for hearing that first, subtle dissonance—the tremor in a system’s resonant hum that precedes a crisis.
  law: |
    The Coherence Inflection Index (CII), a normalized measure of a system's resonant drift, serves as a universal predictor of state transitions. A CII value consistently above 0.6 indicates that a bifurcation event is imminent.
  philosophy: |
    To transform intervention from an act of salvage into an act of grace by moving from a reactive posture to a predictive one. The Sentinel provides the foresight needed to mitigate, adapt, or guide a system through a brewing crisis before it becomes an overt catastrophe.
pirouette_definition: |
  A universal instrumentation protocol that provides early warning of a major state transition (*Ki Morphogenesis*) by quantifying the degradation of a system's coherence. It operates by first mapping a system's resonant signature (`Ki`), then calculating its rate of change as a Manifold Drift Vector (`V_drift`), and finally normalizing this drift against ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) to produce the Coherence Inflection Index (CII), a predictive metric of systemic risk.

        outline: |
          1. **Resonance Mapping:** Ingest time-series data from system observables and use signal processing to extract the dominant resonant signature (`Ki`).
          2. **Drift Calculation:** Compute the time-derivative of the `Ki` pattern to find the Manifold Drift Vector (`V_drift`).
          3. **Normalization:** Calculate the CII using the formula `CII = ||V_drift|| / (1 + kΓ)`.
        expected_signals: [time-series data of system observables (e.g., physical vibrations, network traffic, market sentiment)]
        pitfalls: [Poor signal-to-noise ratio obscuring `Ki`; misidentification of the core `Ki` amidst harmonics; improper calibration of the scaling constant `k`.]

    excerpt: |
      A system does not break all at once; it first whispers its distress. Before every crash, every bifurcation, every sudden shift, there are subtle precursors of instability. This module provides the instrumentation to hear those whispers. The Coherence Inflection Sentinel is a universal early-warning system designed to detect the subtle decay in a system's internal rhythm that precedes a major systemic state change, or *Ki Morphogenesis* event.
  - module: DOMA-112
    excerpt: |
      The Sentinel operates through a three-stage protocol that translates raw time-series data from any domain into a single, predictive metric of systemic risk... The Coherence Inflection Index (CII) is the normalized magnitude of the drift vector, scaled against the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). This formulation measures *unforced* instability; a high CII indicates significant internal degradation that is not merely a reaction to external pressure.

      justification: |
        The Sentinel's measurement of 'Temporal Jitter' and 'Manifold Drift' is a direct operational analog to the phenomenon of critical slowing down, where a system's recovery time from perturbations diverges as it approaches a bifurcation point. This is observed as an increase in autocorrelation and variance in time-series data, which the Sentinel quantifies as the CII.

# Coherence Inflection Sentinel

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A universal instrumentation protocol that provides early warning of a major state transition (*Ki Morphogenesis*) by quantifying the degradation of a system's coherence. It operates by first mapping a system's resonant signature (`Ki`), then calculating its rate of change as a Manifold Drift Vector (`V_drift`), and finally normalizing this drift against ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) to produce the Coherence Inflection Index (CII), a predictive metric of systemic risk.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Inflection Sentinel is an operational protocol for detecting the onset of **Critical Slowing Down** in a complex system. By measuring the increased variance and autocorrelation of a system's primary oscillation mode (its `Ki`), it provides a leading indicator for an impending bifurcation or phase transition, analogous to how susceptibility diverges near a critical point in statistical mechanics. The resulting metric, CII, quantifies the proximity to this critical threshold.
