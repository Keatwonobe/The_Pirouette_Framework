    When quarks hum together, their shared rhythm cancels the loudest parts of the song; only a faint over-tone—the Γ whisper—escapes. The hadron is thus a silenced drum, proof that even the quietest beats belong to the same cosmic percussion.
  law: |
    The Γ-field's contribution to a baryon's magnetic anomaly (Δa_B) is suppressed by a dimensionless factor η_B, which scales with constituent complexity and internal dynamics. For protons, η_p ≈ 10⁻⁵; for neutrons, η_n ≈ 10⁻⁶, rendering the effect currently undetectable but falsifiable with improved precision.
  philosophy: |
    Screening demonstrates how emergent complexity in a bound system can suppress interactions that are fundamental at the constituent level. It reconciles the Γ-field's existence with precision QCD measurements by showing that coherence within composite particles naturally dampens the field's influence, preventing large, easily detectable deviations.
pirouette_definition: |
  The significant reduction of the Γ-field's effective coupling strength inside a composite hadron. This suppression arises from the coherent cancellation of temporal phase contributions from the constituent quarks, mediated by the strong force (gluon field). The screening effect is quantified by a dimensionless factor, η_B, which encapsulates all non-perturbative QCD effects and is specific to each baryon type.

        outline: |
          1. Measure the magnetic moment anomaly (a_B) of a baryon (e.g., proton, neutron) to a precision of 1 part in 10¹⁰ or better.
          2. Calculate the expected Standard Model + QCD prediction for a_B to the same or greater precision.
          3. Attribute any statistically significant residual difference (Δa_B) to the Γ-mediated correction.
          4. Invert the equation Δa_B = η_B * (g_Γ² / 8π²) * (M_B / m_Γ)² to solve for the screening factor η_B.
        expected_signals: [A non-zero residual anomaly Δa_p ~ 10⁻¹⁰ for protons or Δa_n ~ 10⁻¹¹ for neutrons.]
        pitfalls: [Theoretical uncertainty in the SM/QCD calculation for a_B may obscure the signal. Experimental precision may be insufficient to resolve the effect from noise.]

      Within a confined hadron, this coupling is **screened** by gluon coherence, giving an effective reduction factor ( η_B ≪ 1 ). Integrating out quark loops inside a baryon of mass ( M_B ) yields a small additive term to its magnetic anomaly, where ( η_B ) encapsulates QCD shielding and coherence damping (( η_B!∼!10⁻⁵ ) for protons, ( ∼!10⁻⁶ ) for neutrons).

    excerpt: |
      Inside a baryon, Γ excitation manifests as a **beat pattern** between quark temporal phases. The coherence gradient of these beats defines ( η_B ). When baryons interact coherently (as in dense matter), Γ coupling enhances proportionally to local **phase alignment**, providing a natural link to nuclear binding corrections later explored in DYNA-Γ-NUC.

        Similar to how electromagnetic form factors describe the deviation of a composite hadron's charge distribution from that of a point particle, the Screening factor η_B parameterizes the deviation of the composite Γ-coupling from the sum of its constituent quark couplings. It's an effective, non-perturbative parameter encapsulating the integrated effects of QCD dynamics.

      justification: |
        Conceptually analogous to Debye screening, where mobile charge carriers in a plasma screen out electric fields, the gluon field's dynamics within the hadron effectively "screen" the quarks' temporal density from the external Γ-field. In both cases, collective behavior of the medium suppresses a fundamental interaction.

      rationale: The mapping to QCD form factors is most appropriate as both concepts describe how a composite particle's internal structure, governed by QCD, modifies its interaction with an external field compared to its point-like constituents.

    Pirouette's Screening is distinct from color screening in QCD, which relates to the confinement of color charge. It specifically refers to the coherent cancellation of the Γ-field's coupling to *temporal density* within a gluon-mediated bound state, not the screening of a charge.

# Screening

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The significant reduction of the Γ-field's effective coupling strength inside a composite hadron. This suppression arises from the coherent cancellation of temporal phase contributions from the constituent quarks, mediated by the strong force (gluon field). The screening effect is quantified by a dimensionless factor, η_B, which encapsulates all non-perturbative QCD effects and is specific to each baryon type.

## EFT-First Summary
In an effective field theory description, Screening is parameterized by the non-perturbative factor η_B, which modifies the vertex coupling the Γ-field to a composite baryon. It functions as a low-energy constant analogous to a QCD form factor at Q²=0, capturing the integrated effect of gluon dynamics on the otherwise point-like quark couplings. This ensures the theory's predictions remain consistent with high-precision measurements of nucleon properties.
