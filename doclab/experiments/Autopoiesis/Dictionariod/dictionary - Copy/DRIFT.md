        The peril of a pure Sail strategy is Drift. A system with only a sail and no rudder is at the mercy of every current. In a state of pure permeability, its internal coherence bleeds out into the ambient noise of the environment.

  art: |
    A leaf on the current, carried without will or destination. It is the forgetting of one's own song, as the melody dissolves into the universal hum of static. The system becomes a perfect echo of its surroundings, having lost the voice with which to speak its own name.
  law: |
    A system undergoes Drift when the mutual information between its internal state S(t) and its past state S(t-Δt) decays toward zero, while the mutual information between S(t) and the environmental state E(t-Δt) approaches a maximum. The system's dynamics become fully predictable from the environment alone.
  philosophy: |
    Drift is the existential hazard of pure adaptation. It reveals that identity is not a given but a maintained tension against environmental pressure. Without the anchor of Will, the freedom of the Sail becomes a surrender to non-existence, a dissolution back into the undifferentiated whole.
pirouette_definition: |
  Drift is a terminal failure mode of an autonomous system, defined as the progressive and irreversible loss of Temporal Coherence (Kτ) resulting from a strategy that exclusively minimizes Temporal Pressure (V_Γ). Characterized by high boundary permeability, the system's internal resonant pattern (Ki) becomes statistically indistinguishable from environmental noise, its Wound Channel diffuses, and its distinct identity dissolves. It is the peril associated with a pure Freedom strategy.

          4. Drift is measured as a rapid decay in C(τ) concurrent with a high, stable cross-correlation, indicating environmental dynamics are dictating the system's state.

      justification: |
        Drift is analogous to a low-entropy, far-from-equilibrium system losing its distinguishing gradients and reaching thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment (a "heat death"). The loss of internal coherence maps to the dissipation of free energy and the maximization of entropy for the combined system-environment volume.

      rationale: |
        The mapping to decoherence is stronger as it centers on information. In QM, a system's quantum nature is lost as its state becomes entangled with the environment, making it indistinguishable from a classical mixture. Drift is precisely this process: the system's unique informational state ("song") becomes so entangled with environmental noise that its identity is lost from an external or internal perspective.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, Drift is not random motion but a specific failure mode resulting from the *loss of identity* due to excessive environmental adaptation. It is an information-theoretic concept, not a spatial one. It is the direct antonym of Stagnation, the peril of insufficient adaptation.

# Drift

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Drift is a terminal failure mode of an autonomous system, defined as the progressive and irreversible loss of Temporal Coherence (Kτ) resulting from a strategy that exclusively minimizes Temporal Pressure (V_Γ). Characterized by high boundary permeability, the system's internal resonant pattern (Ki) becomes statistically indistinguishable from environmental noise, its Wound Channel diffuses, and its distinct identity dissolves. It is the peril associated with a pure Freedom strategy.

## EFT-First Summary
Drift is operationally analogous to the process of **decoherence** in quantum mechanics. Just as a quantum system loses its unique superposition of states through entanglement with its environment, a system undergoing Drift loses its distinct informational identity by becoming statistically indistinguishable from environmental noise. This loss of coherence is driven by an over-optimization for adaptation, where the system's boundaries become too permeable, leading to a state where its future dynamics are entirely determined by its surroundings rather than its own internal history.
