        In cognitive systems, this manifests as frequency triads obeying the **Ki-Addition Constraint**:

triad:
  art: |
    Three tones, nearly one, a fragile chord sustained against the noise. The moment's hum, a sum of parts held in fleeting resonance. Consciousness is the harmony that endures.
  law: |
    Two neural frequency components, (f‚ÇÅ) and (f‚ÇÇ), resonantly combine to produce a third, (f‚ÇÉ), such that (f‚ÇÉ ‚âà f‚ÇÅ + f‚ÇÇ) within a detuning margin (Œ¥f) that narrows as cognitive load (Œì) increases. The triad must also be phase-locked: (Œ¶‚ÇÉ ‚âà Œ¶‚ÇÅ + Œ¶‚ÇÇ).
  philosophy: |
    This constraint grounds the abstract principle of Coherence Conservation in measurable neurophysiology. It is the bridge from the mathematical syntax of consciousness (the Coherence Conservation Triple) to the physical semantics of brain activity, making awareness a falsifiable, resonant phenomenon.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Ki-Addition Constraint is the rule governing the formation of frequency triads required to sustain a conscious state under the Pirouette model. It specifies that for a triad of frequencies (f‚ÇÅ, f‚ÇÇ, f‚ÇÉ) to support consciousness, the third frequency must be the sum of the first two within a small, load-dependent detuning margin (Œ¥f), and their phases must be locked (Œ¶‚ÇÉ ‚âà Œ¶‚ÇÅ + Œ¶‚ÇÇ). This constraint ensures the conservation of Coherence Area (ùíú_Ki), the invariant energy-phase volume of conscious access.
operational_definition:
  units: Frequency (f) and detuning (Œ¥f) are measured in Hertz (Hz).

        outline: |
          1. Record high-density EEG/MEG from a subject performing a task with varying cognitive load (Œì), such as a bi-stable perception task.
          2. Apply time-frequency decomposition (e.g., Morlet wavelets) to identify candidate frequency components.
          3. For all possible frequency triplets (f‚ÇÅ, f‚ÇÇ, f‚ÇÉ), extract instantaneous phases (Œ¶‚ÇÅ, Œ¶‚ÇÇ, Œ¶‚ÇÉ).
          4. Calculate the Triadic Phase Coupling Index (TPCI) over sliding time windows.
          5. Identify significant TPCI peaks in the (f‚ÇÅ, f‚ÇÇ) plane, indicating phase-locked triads satisfying f‚ÇÉ ‚âà f‚ÇÅ + f‚ÇÇ.

    excerpt: |
      Following [MATH-024], consciousness is modeled as the maintenance of a **Coherence Conservation Triple** ({E_C, J_Œº, Œ¶_Œì}) within biological substrate limits. In cognitive systems, this manifests as frequency triads obeying the **Ki-Addition Constraint**: [f_3 = f_1 + f_2 \pm \delta f]
  - module: COG-RES-001
    excerpt: |
      **Triadic Resonance Hypothesis:** Conscious perception coincides with phase-locked triads satisfying the Ki-addition rule.
      **Detuning Constraint Hypothesis:** The allowed detuning (Œîf) narrows as (Œì) (task complexity / entropy load) increases.

      justification: |
        The Ki-Addition Constraint is mathematically isomorphic to the frequency conservation condition in three-wave mixing, a fundamental nonlinear optical process. The phase-locking requirement (Œ¶‚ÇÉ ‚âà Œ¶‚ÇÅ + Œ¶‚ÇÇ) is analogous to the phase-matching condition required for efficient energy transfer between waves. Neural tissue acts as the nonlinear medium.

      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "If conscious report occurs in the absence of a significant Triadic Phase Coupling Index (TPCI) ridge, or if the TPCI ridge does not correspond to f‚ÇÉ ‚âà f‚ÇÅ + f‚ÇÇ, the claim is falsified."

    - statement: "The allowed detuning margin (Œ¥f) is inversely related to cognitive load (Œì), specifically Œîf_allowed ‚àù Œì‚Åª¬π/¬≤."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If the bandwidth of resonant triads does not narrow, or narrows with a different functional form (e.g., linearly), as task complexity increases, the claim is falsified."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [None within Pirouette. In physics, 'k' often denotes a wavenumber, but 'Ki' here is a distinct identifier tied to Coherence Area (ùíú_Ki).]
  disambiguation: |
    This is not a generic rule for all neural frequency interactions, but is specifically hypothesized to constrain those triads that support conscious access. It is distinct from harmonic relationships (f_n = n * f‚ÇÅ) or broadband coupling. The "Ki" prefix links it directly to the conservation of Coherence Area (ùíú_Ki).
