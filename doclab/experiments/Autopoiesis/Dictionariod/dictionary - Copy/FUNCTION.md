  art: |
    As one zooms out, the laws of the system shift, their parameters flowing like rivers towards the sea of simplicity or the mountains of complexity. The β-function is the current, guiding this journey from the smallest scales to the largest.
  law: |
    The β-function, β_i(g), is the vector field defining the evolution of the coupling constants g_i with respect to the logarithm of the energy scale μ: β_i ≡ d g_i/d ln μ. Zeros of this vector field, β(g*)=0, correspond to scale-invariant fixed points of the theory.
  philosophy: |
    The β-function operationalizes the concept of scale dependence, revealing a theory's deep structure. It unifies disparate behaviors at different energies, exposing UV origins and IR fates, and mapping the fundamental phases of the system (e.g., free, confined-like) as emergent properties of the flow.
pirouette_definition: |
  The β-function, denoted β_i, quantifies the rate of change of a coupling constant g_i with respect to the logarithm of the energy scale μ. In the Pirouette Framework, it is computed non-perturbatively by a numerical coarse-graining procedure on the (Γ,K) system, implemented via block-spin transformations on a lattice. The flow generated by integrating β(g) is used to identify UV/IR fixed points, map the system's phase diagram, and compute scale-dependent observables like running couplings and operator relevance.

# β-function

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The β-function, denoted β_i, quantifies the rate of change of a coupling constant g_i with respect to the logarithm of the energy scale μ. In the Pirouette Framework, it is computed non-perturbatively by a numerical coarse-graining procedure on the (Γ,K) system, implemented via block-spin transformations on a lattice. The flow generated by integrating β(g) is used to identify UV/IR fixed points, map the system's phase diagram, and compute scale-dependent observables like running couplings and operator relevance.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette β-function is the standard Renormalization Group (RG) β-function from Quantum Field Theory, defined as the derivative of a coupling constant with respect to the logarithm of the energy scale (β_i = d g_i / d ln μ). It is computed non-perturbatively via lattice methods to determine how the theory's interactions change from high energies (UV) to low energies (IR). Its behavior governs the emergence of different physical phases and the scale-dependence of observables. (See: Peskin & Schroeder, *An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*, Ch. 12).
