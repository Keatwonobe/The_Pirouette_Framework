        - **Attention debt**: cumulative increases in \(V_{\text{obs}}\) imposed on users (probe burden).
        - **Autonomy loss**: mutual-information between CAP levers and private state *without* consent (must be ≤0).

  art: |
    The cost of a perfect song sung by a choir whose throats are being tightened. It is the hoarseness, the trust broken, the singers who don't return for the encore—the un-booked harm generated by narrow optimization.
  law: |
    Any system optimizing for a primary objective (e.g., Coherent Adherence, Ta) must also compute and publish a Dark Residue functional (D). If a pre-declared, non-zero Residue Budget is breached (λD > Budget), the system must automatically roll back the causal intervention.
  philosophy: |
    To make legible the negative, often unmetered, externalities of optimization. It operationalizes a 'do no harm' principle by ensuring that gains in system coherence are not paid for by un-consented losses in user autonomy, attention, or welfare.
pirouette_definition: |
  A functional, D, that quantifies the net negative externalities generated by a system intervention, framed as a penalty term in an optimization objective. It is defined as a weighted sum of welfare divergence, risk externalities, attention debt, and autonomy loss. D serves as the basis for auditable harm budgets and automated safety rollbacks in consent-based protocols.

        outline: |
          1. Define the set of system control levers (A) and the participant's private state manifold (S_private), which is not explicitly shared for the intervention.
          2. Over a defined time window, log the time series of applied levers a(t) and, via a trusted auditor or privacy-preserving method, the corresponding s(t).
          3. Compute the mutual information I(A; S_private). A non-zero value indicates autonomy loss.

        pitfalls: [Difficulty in defining/accessing S_private, statistical noise in MI estimation]
      - name: Attention Debt Metering
        outline: |
          1. Instrument all system-initiated interfaces that demand user cognitive load (e.g., notifications, prompts, required readings).
          2. Assign a cost to each interaction, measured in estimated processing time or bits of information to parse.
          3. Sum these costs over a defined period to calculate the total debt. This is equivalent to integrating the user-facing component of the Shadow Gauge (V_obs).
        expected_signals: [Interaction event logs with associated costs]
        pitfalls: [Inaccurate cost modeling for cognitive load, failing to log all relevant interactions]

      **Protocol goal (non-manipulative form):**
      \[
      \max_{\mathcal A}\;\;\underbrace{\mathbf E[\,K_\tau(T_a)\,]}_{\text{usable coherence}}
      -\underbrace{V_\Gamma}_{\text{pressure}}
      -\underbrace{V_{\text{obs}}}_{\text{observer cost}}
      -\lambda\,\underbrace{\mathcal D}_{\text{Dark Residue}}
      \quad \text{s.t.}\;\;\mathcal C_{\mathrm{consent}},\;\mathcal C_{\mathrm{transparency}}.
      \]
      Here ... D is the *Dark Residue* functional (negative externalities), and the constraints enforce **consent + transparency**.
  - module: DYNA-005_coherent_adherence_protocol
    excerpt: |
      Every deployment sets λ and publishes a **Residue Budget**; breaching it triggers auto-rollback (“kill-switch”). The Residue Ledger logs externalities into D with corrective obligations.

        // D maps to R(θ), the regularizer
      justification: |
        In machine learning and optimal control, a regularization term is added to the loss function to penalize complexity or undesirable solutions (e.g., L2 norm on weights). Dark Residue acts precisely as a regularizer, penalizing solutions that achieve the primary objective at the cost of ethical or functional externalities.

      justification: |
        In welfare economics, a negative externality is a cost imposed on a third party who did not agree to incur that cost. Dark Residue is a framework for operationalizing and accounting for such externalities (e.g., attention debt, autonomy loss) within a closed system's optimization loop.

  claims:
    - statement: "A system operating under a strict, non-zero Dark Residue budget will produce fewer negative externalities than an unconstrained system optimizing for the same primary goal."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "An experiment demonstrates that a system with a Residue Budget still produces un-metered harm (e.g., high user churn, frustration) not captured by the D functional, or that the auto-rollback mechanism consistently fails to prevent the harm it is designed to."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from diffusion coefficients in physics (L²/T) or the dimensionality of a space (dimensionless integer). In Pirouette, D is a functional representing a *cost* or *penalty* related to system-induced negative externalities, with contextual or dimensionless units.
