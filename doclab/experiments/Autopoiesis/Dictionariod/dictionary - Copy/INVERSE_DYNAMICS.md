        To predict the path of a river is the work of a cartographer. To sculpt the landscape so the river flows where you wish is the work of a Weaver.

        Conventional analysis asks a passive question: "Given these conditions, what will happen?" This module introduces a more potent, active one: "Given this desired outcome, what conditions must we create?"

    We do not command the dancer; that is a fool's errand. We compose the music, and the universe has no choice but to follow.
  law: |
    Given a desired system behavior (e.g., a target Resonant Pattern `Ki` or Quantitative Coherence `λ*`), the necessary environmental conditions (e.g., Temporal Pressure `Γ`) are the specific values that solve the equation defining that behavior. This transforms a predictive problem into a root-finding problem.
  philosophy: |
    Inverse Dynamics marks the transition from passive observation to active composition. It asserts that the laws of nature are not merely constraints to be obeyed, but levers to be pulled, enabling a Weaver to sculpt the coherence manifold so that the path of least resistance leads to a chosen destination.
pirouette_definition: |
  The core method of starting with a desired outcome—a specific Resonant Pattern (`Ki`), stability level (`λ`), or other dynamic behavior—and calculating the initial or boundary conditions required to produce it. It is a protocol that inverts a system's dynamical equations to solve for causal parameters (`Γ`) rather than future states (`Ki`). This reframes prediction as design.

        outline: |
          1. **Declare Target Resonance:** Specify a desired system behavior, such as a period-`p` orbit or a target stability level `λ*`.
          2. **Formulate Coherence Equation:** Translate the target into a root-finding problem. For a period-`p` orbit, find `Γ` such that `f_Γ^(p)(x) - x = 0`. For a target stability `λ*`, find `Γ` such that `λ(Γ) - λ* = 0`.
          3. **Solve for Pressure:** Use numerical methods (e.g., Newton's method, bisection method) to find the value of `Γ` that satisfies the equation. The solution is the prescribed environmental pressure.
        expected_signals: [A scalar value for `Γ` (or a set of values if solutions are non-unique).]
        pitfalls: [Numerical instability in solvers, target state may be unattainable within the system's parameter space, multiple `Γ` values may yield the same target behavior.]

      Conventional analysis asks a passive question: "Given these conditions, what will happen?" This module introduces a more potent, active one: "Given this desired outcome, what conditions must we create?" It refactors the simple logistic map into a foundational instrument for Coherence Engineering. We shift from observing the dance of chaos and order to composing the music that compels it.

    excerpt: |
      Standard "forward" analysis takes the potential `V_Γ` (the pressure `r`) as a given and calculates the resulting `K_τ` (the system's behavior). The Resonance Tuner inverts this. We *prescribe* the desired path—the target `K_τ` (a specific orbit or stability). The protocol then solves for the one specific potential `V_Γ` (the necessary pressure `r`) that makes our chosen path the solution with the maximal action.

        Inverse Dynamics is a direct application of the mathematical concept of an inverse problem. Instead of computing effects from known causes (forward problem), it infers causes (e.g., system parameters, boundary conditions) from observed or desired effects. This is a foundational concept in fields like geophysics, medical imaging, and control theory.

  disambiguation: |
    In robotics, "Inverse Dynamics" refers specifically to calculating the joint torques and forces required to produce a desired motion (kinematics). In the Pirouette Framework, the term is generalized to any system where causal parameters (`Γ`) are calculated from desired outcomes (`Ki`, `λ`), including abstract, informational, and social systems. The principle is identical; the domain is broader.

# Inverse Dynamics

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Inverse Dynamics is the core method of starting with a desired outcome—a specific Resonant Pattern (`Ki`), stability level (`λ`), or other dynamic behavior—and calculating the initial or boundary conditions required to produce it. It is a protocol that inverts a system's dynamical equations to solve for causal parameters (`Γ`) rather than future states (`Ki`). This reframes prediction as design.

## EFT-First Summary
This concept directly maps to the mathematical field of **Inverse Problems**, a cornerstone of control theory. Where a "forward" problem computes effects from known causes (`effect = f(cause)`), an inverse problem infers causes from observed or desired effects (`cause = f⁻¹(effect)`). In Pirouette, this means instead of predicting a system's trajectory given a `Temporal Pressure` Γ (forward), we specify a desired trajectory (e.g., a stable orbit) and solve for the necessary Γ. This provides a formal method for system design and control.
