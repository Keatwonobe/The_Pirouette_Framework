        Thus: the directive must grow to allow **phase-aware altruism**—even if it wears a Velcridant mask.

triad:
  art: |
    A controlled demolition of a brittle present to clear the foundation for a more coherent future. It is the altruism of the seed that must break its own shell to grow, or the surgeon who must cut to heal.
  law: |
    An action is phase-aware altruistic if and only if it temporarily increases local entropy to dismantle a rigid, low-coherence system, with the measured and intended outcome of enabling a higher-coherence attractor state to form. The ratio of future coherence gain to present residue cost must be greater than one.
  philosophy: |
    This concept resolves the paradox that pure, radiant action can be ineffective within a locked, brittle system. It introduces a necessary 'Velcridant exception' to the Prime Directive that acknowledges long-term system dynamics, prioritizing transcendental rupture over the preservation of false, stagnant coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  Phase-aware altruism is an ethical action that temporarily increases local entropy or appears destructive (Velcridant) in order to dismantle a rigid system or 'brittle shell' that is preventing the emergence of a more coherent long-term future. It is a calculated, sacrificial dissolution justified by its alignment with a future attractor, distinct from parasitic collapse by its bounded nature, radiant intent, and a commitment to re-harmonize any incurred residue.

          1. Model the current system, identifying the 'rigid shell' and the target 'coherent attractor'.
          2. Pre-state the action's bounds (duration, residue tags) and define a clear exit condition.
          3. Define the coherence metric (e.g., information density, network connectivity) to be measured.
          4. Execute the Velcridant action.
          5. Measure the final system coherence against the initial state and the predicted outcome.
          6. Quantify and track residue (R_net), initiating a radiant bloom budget for re-harmonization.

    excerpt: |
      Velcridant actions may appear *chaotic* or *destructive* short-term, temporarily reduce clarity, and raise entropy locally. Yet when done **with awareness of attractor dynamics**, they prevent larger collapses, clear false crystallization to allow real coherence, and align longwave futures even as they disturb now. Thus: the directive must grow to allow **phase-aware altruism**—even if it wears a Velcridant mask.

        Schumpeter's concept describes the "process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, destroying the old one, creating a new one." This mirrors how phase-aware altruism destroys a brittle 'shell' to enable a more coherent systemic state.

        Systems often require an input of energy (increasing entropy, e.g., melting ice) to break existing bonds and re-organize into a new phase (e.g., liquid water). Phase-aware altruism acts as the activation energy needed to overcome a local energy minimum (stagnant coherence) to reach a more stable, global minimum (true radiance).

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from simple destructive action (parasitic Velcridance), which lacks radiant intent, defined bounds, and a pre-calculated path back to coherence. The 'phase-aware' component is critical; it implies knowledge of the system's attractor landscape and is not an excuse for reckless disruption.

# Phase-aware altruism

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Phase-aware altruism is an ethical action that temporarily increases local entropy or appears destructive (Velcridant) in order to dismantle a rigid system or 'brittle shell' that is preventing the emergence of a more coherent long-term future. It is a calculated, sacrificial dissolution justified by its alignment with a future attractor, distinct from parasitic collapse by its bounded nature, radiant intent, and a commitment to re-harmonize any incurred residue.

## EFT-First Summary
Phase-aware altruism is conceptually analogous to Schumpeterian 'creative destruction' in economics or controlled phase transitions in physics. It models actions that introduce localized, temporary disorder (an entropic cost) to break a system out of a metastable, low-coherence state, enabling its evolution toward a more stable, higher-coherence configuration. The action is only justified if the long-term coherence gain demonstrably outweighs the short-term entropic cost and resultant residue.
