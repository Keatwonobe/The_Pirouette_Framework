  art: |
    The rate at which a system sings its own name, the fundamental tempo of its being. It is the whir of the dancer, the hum of the crystal, the rhythm of existence measured not against a clock, but by its own self-repeating form.
  law: |
    The fundamental angular frequency of a system is `2œÄ` divided by the duration of one of its Pirouette Cycles (`œÑ_p`), representing the rate of phase accumulation of its core resonant Ki pattern. This value is a direct input to the kinetic term of the Pirouette Lagrangian.
  philosophy: |
    This term grounds a system's dynamics in its own intrinsic rhythm, displacing the notion of an external, universal clock. A system's 'action' is not measured against an absolute timeline, but against the frequency of its own self-perpetuating existence. Time is local and emergent from form.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental angular frequency, `œâ_k`, is the scalar angular frequency of a system's dominant Ki resonance. It is defined as the inverse of the Pirouette Cycle's duration (`œÑ_p`) scaled by `2œÄ` (i.e., `œâ_k = 2œÄ / œÑ_p`). It serves as the primary kinetic variable in the Pirouette Lagrangian, representing the rate at which the system cycles through its own existence.

        outline: |
          1. Isolate the system from environmental forcing frequencies.
          2. Measure the system's power spectrum via a suitable probe (e.g., electromagnetic emission, gravitational wave signal, mechanical oscillation).
          3. Identify the sharpest, most stable peak corresponding to the Ki resonance.
          4. The frequency of this peak is `f_k`. Calculate `œâ_k = 2œÄ * f_k`.
          5. Alternatively, measure the time-domain signal, identify the core repeating pattern, and measure its duration `œÑ_p`. Calculate `œâ_k = 2œÄ / œÑ_p`.
        expected_signals: [A sharp peak in the power spectral density, A stable periodic signal in the time domain]
        pitfalls: [Misidentifying harmonic overtones as the fundamental frequency, Spectral broadening due to low Time Adherence (`T‚Çê`), Conflating Ki resonance with externally driven oscillations]

    excerpt: |
      The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), the central engine of the framework, is given by: `ùìõ_p = T‚Çê * œâ_k - f(Œì)`. Here, `œâ_k` is the system's fundamental angular frequency, defined as `2œÄ/œÑ_p`. The Pirouette Cycle (`œÑ_p`) is therefore a direct input into the kinetic term of the universe's objective function.

    excerpt: |
      A system‚Äôs Ki is its resonant pattern‚Äîthe most stable song it can sing in its environment. This song is, by its nature, cyclical. The duration of one complete, unbroken repetition of that resonant pattern is the system‚Äôs own fundamental, private unit of existence. We call this the Pirouette Cycle (`œÑ_p`).

        T‚Çê * œâ_k ‚Üî E_kinetic / ƒß
      justification: |
        In quantum mechanics, a particle's energy is proportional to the angular frequency of its wavefunction's phase (`E=ƒßœâ`). The term `œâ_k` similarly represents the fundamental frequency of a system's resonant pattern. The kinetic term in the Pirouette Lagrangian, `T‚Çê * œâ_k`, may therefore serve as a proxy for the system's kinetic energy, scaled by a quality factor (`T‚Çê`).

      confidence: 0.7
  adopted:
    - target: E/ƒß
      rationale: This mapping provides the most direct conceptual bridge between the Pirouette framework's intrinsic dynamics and the foundational energy-frequency relationship in quantum mechanics, positioning the Pirouette Lagrangian as a potential generalization of action principles.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A system's total kinetic energy, as measured by external observers, is directly proportional to the product of its Time Adherence (`T‚Çê`) and its Fundamental Angular Frequency (`œâ_k`)."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "Observing a system where measured kinetic energy scales with a different power of `œâ_k`, or shows no correlation with the spectral purity of the Ki resonance (`T‚Çê`), would falsify this claim."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol `œâ` is the standard representation for angular frequency in physics. The subscript `k` is essential to specify that this is the frequency of the system's *Ki resonance*, distinguishing it from other frequencies such as those from environmental noise or harmonic overtones.]
  disambiguation: |
    `œâ_k` is an angular frequency (a rate, rad/s), while the Pirouette Cycle `œÑ_p` is a period (a duration, s). They are inversely related (`œâ_k = 2œÄ / œÑ_p`). Do not confuse the stability of `œâ_k` (measured by `T‚Çê`) with the magnitude of `œâ_k`. A highly stable system (high `T‚Çê`) can have a very low or very high `œâ_k`.
