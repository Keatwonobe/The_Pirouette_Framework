      snippet: |
        A rupture is a **coherence cascade**: a rapid, self-propagating phase transition from a high-information state of order to a low-information state of chaos. It is the process that unfolds when a system’s internal coherence is overwhelmed by temporal pressure, and the cost of maintaining form becomes unsustainable.

  art: |
    Every system is a song—a resonant pattern held against noise. A rupture is the moment the song shatters, a violent testament not to a flaw in the material, but to the laws of coherence.
  law: |
    A system ruptures when its Pirouette Lagrangian becomes non-positive (`𝓛_p ≤ 0`). This event is preceded by a sustained negative time-derivative (`∂𝓛_p / ∂t < 0`), which serves as a predictive indicator of catastrophic failure.
  philosophy: |
    Rupture reframes failure not as a material or moral flaw, but as a universal, time-first dynamic. It teaches that integrity is a continuous, energetic process of maintaining coherence against pressure, and that collapse is the inevitable result when this process becomes unsustainable.
pirouette_definition: |
  A catastrophic, self-propagating phase transition from an ordered, high-information state to a chaotic, low-information state. It occurs when ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) overwhelms a system's Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`), causing its Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`) to cross zero. This triggers a Coherence Cascade that violently converts stored order into dissonant energy, creating a permanent, information-severing Wound Boundary in the system's coherence manifold.

          1. Map domain-specific stressors to a Temporal Pressure map (`V_Γ`).
          2. Model the system's internal resonance and adaptability as Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`).
          3. Calculate the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = Kτ - VΓ`) in near-real-time.
          4. Monitor the time-derivative `∂𝓛_p / ∂t`. A sustained negative trend is the primary predictive indicator of rupture risk.
        expected_signals: [Sustained `∂𝓛_p / ∂t < 0` (early warning), `𝓛_p` crossing zero (rupture onset), explosive release of dissonant noise (cascade propagation)]
        pitfalls: [Mischaracterizing `Kτ` as static (missing brittle risk), ignoring cyclical stressors (missing fatigue), poor mapping of stressors to `V_Γ`.]

    excerpt: |
      A rupture is not an instantaneous event but a self-propagating process. [...] The failure of one bond is the catalyst for a chain reaction. The potential energy stored in that bond is released as a shockwave of dissonant noise, violently increasing the local `Γ` for its neighbors. This is the **Coherence Cascade**: a self-sustaining, explosive conversion of stored order into chaotic energy.

    excerpt: |
      **Brittle Rupture (The Sudden Shattering):** This occurs in systems that appear stable and highly ordered (`Laminar Flow`) but possess a rigid, unadaptive `Kτ` pattern. When faced with a sudden, sharp increase in `Γ`, the system cannot deform or adapt. It maintains its coherence perfectly until the moment it fails completely and catastrophically.
  - module: DOMA-131
    excerpt: |
      A rupture permanently alters the geometry of a system's being by creating a **Wound Boundary**. This is not merely a memory of stress like a `Wound Channel`, but a new, harsh, and irreversible topological feature—a scar where a single coherent body was violently torn into two or more entities.

        The condition `𝓛_p ≤ 0` is conceptually analogous to Griffith's energy balance criterion for fracture. The term `Kτ` maps to the stored elastic potential energy (`U`) released by crack growth, while `V_Γ` maps to the surface energy (`γS`) required to create new fracture surfaces. Rupture (crack propagation) becomes energetically favorable when the energy released exceeds the energy cost of creating the boundary.

The system's state is the behavior variable, while `Kτ` and `V_Γ` act as the control parameters, defining a stability surface where a smooth change in parameters can lead to a sudden jump to a new, disconnected state.

# Systemic Rupture

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A catastrophic, self-propagating phase transition from an ordered, high-information state to a chaotic, low-information state. It occurs when ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) overwhelms a system's Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`), causing its Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`) to cross zero. This triggers a Coherence Cascade that violently converts stored order into dissonant energy, creating a permanent, information-severing Wound Boundary in the system's coherence manifold.

## EFT-First Summary
Systemic Rupture is modeled as a catastrophic phase transition analogous to brittle fracture in continuum mechanics. The rupture condition, `𝓛_p ≤ 0`, mirrors Griffith's criterion, where the release of a system's stored coherent energy (`Kτ`) becomes sufficient to overcome the energetic cost of creating a new, information-severing boundary (`V_Γ`). The event is thus not a failure of material but an energetically favorable transition to a lower-order state.
