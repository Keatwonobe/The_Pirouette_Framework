  art: |
    To build a bridge, one must first lower the drawbridge. It is the shared space between two fortresses, willingly undefended, where a new kingdom can be born.
  law: |
    The probability of a successful Resonant Handshake scales with the product of the vulnerability indices (μᵥ) of the interacting systems, defined as the inverse of their respective Wound Channel inertia. A union cannot form under unilateral vulnerability.
  philosophy: |
    Separation is the default energetic state of high-defense systems. Mutual Vulnerability is the conscious, metabolically expensive choice to overcome this default, positing that the potential coherence dividend of union outweighs the immediate risk of exposure. It is the fundamental wager of trust.
pirouette_definition: |
  Mutual Vulnerability is a necessary condition for a Resonant Handshake, defined as the reciprocal, willing reduction of Wound Channel (`CORE-011`) inertia by two or more interacting systems. This act of Shared Trust lowers defensive boundaries, creating the shared crucible required for an Alchemical Union by making the unified state the path of least energetic resistance under sufficient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`).

        outline: |
          Introduce a low-amplitude, non-threatening resonant probe (`Ki_probe`) to System A and measure the damping response of its Wound Channel; the damping coefficient is proportional to the channel's inertia. The Mutual Vulnerability is observed as a correlated, simultaneous reduction in the damping coefficients of both systems when they are co-present and engaged in a pre-handshake dialogue.

      3. **Mutual Vulnerability in a Shared Crucible (Shared Trust):** Each system must willingly lower the inertia of its own `Wound Channel` (`CORE-011`), an act of trust that relaxes the defensive boundaries of the self. This must occur within a "crucible"—a context of sufficient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), whether from a shared external challenge or a mutual internal desire for connection—where the unified state becomes the path of least resistance.

      justification: |
        The 'Wound Channel inertia' acts as a potential barrier V₀ preventing two systems from merging. Mutual Vulnerability is the active process of lowering this barrier, enabling the systems to 'tunnel' or transition into a lower, shared energy state (the Alchemical Union).

      rationale: |
        This mapping best captures the core dynamic of risk, trust, and payoff optimization inherent in Mutual Vulnerability. It operationalizes 'trust' as a strategic choice—risking exploitation for the chance of a high-payoff, mutually cooperative equilibrium ('coherence dividend')—rather than a purely abstract quality.

  disambiguation: |
    Mutual Vulnerability is distinct from a simple 'weakness' or 'flaw'. It is a *willing and reciprocal* lowering of defenses for the specific purpose of union, not a passive state of being undefended. It is a strategic act, not a static property.

# Mutual Vulnerability

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Mutual Vulnerability is a necessary condition for a Resonant Handshake, defined as the reciprocal, willing reduction of Wound Channel (`CORE-011`) inertia by two or more interacting systems. This act of Shared Trust lowers defensive boundaries, creating the shared crucible required for an Alchemical Union by making the unified state the path of least energetic resistance under sufficient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`).

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, Mutual Vulnerability maps to the strategic choice to 'cooperate' in an iterated interaction, analogous to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. By lowering defenses (`Wound Channel` inertia), a system risks exploitation ('defection') but enables the possibility of achieving a high-payoff, mutually cooperative equilibrium (the 'coherence dividend' of `Symbiotic Resonance`). This act is modeled as the active lowering of a potential barrier between systems, where the barrier's height corresponds to the system's defensive posture.
