    As a tree's branching pattern repeats from twig to trunk, a system's core dynamics—its coherence, pressure, and pulse—unfold predictably across the octaves of scale. Scale Dynamics is the mathematical description of this self-similar echo.
  law: |
    The rate of change of a system's core properties (Coherence Kτ, Pressure VΓ, Pulse τp) with respect to the logarithm of its characteristic length scale (s = ln L) is a deterministic function (β) of those properties at that scale. The system's behavior at one scale thus predicts its behavior at another.
  philosophy: |
    By treating scale not as a static parameter but as a dynamic dimension, we unlock a universal grammar for system evolution. This allows for principled generalization, transforming the "art" of cross-scale prediction into a measurable, optimizable science.
pirouette_definition: |
  Scale Dynamics is the principle that key system observables—primarily Coherence (Kτ), Pressure (VΓ), and Pulse (τp)—evolve according to a set of coupled, first-order ordinary differential equations with respect to the logarithm of the length scale, `s = ln L`. The functions governing this evolution, the β-operators, describe the system's phase (e.g., laminar, turbulent) and enable the prediction of its properties at unobserved scales by integrating the flow equations.

        outline: |
          1. Sample a system or signal across multiple, logarithmically-spaced windows or scales (L_i).
          2. For each scale, compute the observables: Coherence (Kτ) via compression gain, Pressure (VΓ) via fluctuation analysis, and Pulse (τp) via spectral analysis.
          3. Approximate the derivative `dX/ds` using finite differences: `[X(L_{i+1}) - X(L_i)] / [ln L_{i+1} - ln L_i]`.
          4. Fit the resulting data points `(X, dX/ds)` to the polynomial form of the β-operators to estimate universal exponents (e.g., d_K, d_Γ) and coefficients.
        expected_signals: [Time-series data, token sequences, spatial data (images, volumes)]

    excerpt: |
      The predictive content of Pirouette is a *scale dynamics*. The rate of change of Coherence (Kτ), Pressure (VΓ), and Pulse (τp) with respect to log-scale `s` is governed by a set of β-operators. These operators define the phase of the system (Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant) through their fixed points and associated exponents.
  - module: CORE-015
    excerpt: |
      The Coherence AI objective function directly implements Scale Dynamics as a regularizer. The loss function encourages maximizing coherence gain (ΔKτ) while penalizing environmental pressure (VΓ) and, crucially, enforcing consistency with the predicted beat scaling from the PRG equations. This bakes a fundamental physical prior for stable, hierarchical structure formation into the learning process.

        The Pirouette Renormalization Group (PRG) is a direct application of the Wilsonian RG concept to a specific set of observables {Kτ, VΓ, τp}. The log-scale `s` is the flow parameter, the observables act as the "couplings" of an effective theory, and the β-functions describe how these couplings change upon coarse-graining (increasing L). The fixed points of this flow (`β(X*) = 0`) correspond to scale-invariant phases.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, β or a "β-operator" exclusively refers to the rate of change of a quantity with respect to log-scale, `d/d(ln L)`, in direct analogy to its use in the Renormalization Group formalism. Context should always involve a discussion of scale or renormalization.

# Scale Dynamics

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Scale Dynamics is the principle that key system observables—primarily Coherence (Kτ), Pressure (VΓ), and Pulse (τp)—evolve according to a set of coupled, first-order ordinary differential equations with respect to the logarithm of the length scale, `s = ln L`. The functions governing this evolution, the β-operators, describe the system's phase (e.g., laminar, turbulent) and enable the prediction of its properties at unobserved scales by integrating the flow equations.

## EFT-First Summary
Scale Dynamics is the Pirouette Framework's implementation of the Renormalization Group (RG) flow. System parameters, modeled as "couplings" like Coherence (Kτ) and Pressure (VΓ), are not static but "flow" as a function of the logarithm of the observation scale (`s = ln L`). This flow is governed by β-functions, `dX/ds = β(X)`, whose fixed points correspond to the observable, scale-invariant phases of the system (e.g., laminar, turbulent). The framework uses this principle to make predictions across scales and as a regularization objective for AI models to improve generalization. This is analogous to how coupling constants run with energy scale in QFT (see Peskin & Schroeder, Ch. 12).
