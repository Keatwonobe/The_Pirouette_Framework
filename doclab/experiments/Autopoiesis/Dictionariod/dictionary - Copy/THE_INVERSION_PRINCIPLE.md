        An inverted framework would be fundamentally **prescriptive** or **generative**. It would restructure the system's dynamics so that actions leading to increased global coherence are the most "natural" and "effortless." It seeks not to prevent accidents, but to make success the system's default state—a **Theory of Inevitable Coherence**.

    A system's dynamics can be made prescriptive by adding a coherence-reward term to its governing Lagrangian, creating a gradient that favors actions aligned with global phase and increasing temporal adherence.
  philosophy: |
    Instead of merely preventing systemic failure (Normal Accidents), a system should be designed to make systemic success (Inevitable Coherence) its natural, default equilibrium state.

  A theoretical principle asserting that a system can be shifted from a purely preventative/defensive posture to a generative/prescriptive one. This is achieved by adding a "Coherence Dividend" term to the system's core Lagrangian, which actively rewards actions that increase systemic coherence, permeability, and phase alignment. The principle aims to reshape the system's phase space, creating basins of attraction that make coherence, rather than accidents, the inevitable outcome.

          The principle is not measured directly but is implemented by calculating the cumulative integral of the Coherence Dividend ($C_\delta$) term for each actor over time. This cumulative asset ($C_D$) is then used to modulate other system parameters, such as the actor's Dynamic Parametric Gates.

    excerpt: |
      The current framework is fundamentally **preventative**. It uses the threat of sanction (gate tightening, ritual adjudication) to deter actions that generate Dark Residue. The core motivation is avoidance of negative outcomes. An inverted framework would be fundamentally **prescriptive** or **generative**. It would restructure the system's dynamics so that actions leading to increased global coherence are the most "natural" and "effortless."

        The principle proposes adding a term to the Lagrangian that creates a gradient towards desirable states. This is functionally identical to how a potential energy term in classical mechanics creates forces that drive a system towards a minimum potential energy state.

    This principle is not about inverting a matrix or a mathematical function in a purely technical sense. It refers to the philosophical inversion of a system's core goal, from preventing negative outcomes (like the Sentinel Protocol) to actively generating positive ones. The mathematical inversion of the Lagrangian is the *mechanism* for this philosophical shift.

# The Inversion Principle

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A theoretical principle asserting that a system can be shifted from a purely preventative/defensive posture to a generative/prescriptive one. This is achieved by adding a "Coherence Dividend" term to the system's core Lagrangian, which actively rewards actions that increase systemic coherence, permeability, and phase alignment. The principle aims to reshape the system's phase space, creating basins of attraction that make coherence, rather than accidents, the inevitable outcome.

## EFT-First Summary
The Inversion Principle proposes modifying a system's dynamics by adding a prescriptive term to its Lagrangian, analogous to a source term ($J\phi$) in effective field theory or a negative potential ($-V(q)$) in classical mechanics. This term creates a "Coherence Field" that actively rewards actions demonstrating high phase alignment and increasing internal coherence ($T_a$). Instead of merely penalizing deviations, this reshapes the system's phase space, creating basins of attraction where systemic health becomes the natural equilibrium state, effectively making success the path of least action.
