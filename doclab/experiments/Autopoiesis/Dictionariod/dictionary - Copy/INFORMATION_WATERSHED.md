    A vast landscape of thought and meaning, sculpted by the rivers of coherent ideas and eroded by the constant rain of noise. Its geography dictates the flow of knowledge, creating deserts of dogma and fertile deltas of innovation.
  law: |
    The topology of an Information Watershed dictates the flow of Coherence (`Kτ`), where "truth" manifests as a geodesic—the most efficient path minimizing systemic friction under ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). System health is measured by the prevalence of laminar over turbulent or stagnant flow.
  philosophy: |
    To treat information not as a resource to be managed but as a living ecosystem to be tended. It reframes the struggle for truth as an ecological imperative: cultivating the conditions for clarity and connection to arise naturally from the landscape of shared understanding.
pirouette_definition: |
  An Information Watershed is the dynamic, n-dimensional manifold representing an information ecosystem. Its topography is defined by the distribution of Coherence (`Kτ`) and is constantly reshaped by the currents of communication, resonant synthesis, and the erosive force of Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). The paths of least resistance within this landscape are Wound Channels, which guide the propagation of ideas and constitute the system's memory.

          1. Define the system boundary (e.g., a research team, a social media network).
          2. Identify primary coherence carriers (e.g., key documents, communication channels, influential nodes).
          3. Sample signal fidelity and semantic drift at various points along flow paths using differential analysis of versioned documents or communication logs.
          4. Classify flow regimes as Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant based on signal degradation rates and cross-current interference.
          5. Reconstruct the manifold topology by identifying "dams" (stagnation points), "rapids" (turbulence), and "channels" (laminar flow).

    excerpt: |
      We exist within an information watershed, a landscape carved by currents of knowledge, meaning, and noise. We are drowning in data—a condition of high, chaotic Temporal Pressure (Γ)—yet starving for wisdom, which is a state of high coherence. This module provides the Weaver with the lens to see this landscape for what it is: a living ecosystem, governed by the universal laws of coherence and flow.
  - module: DOMA-143
    excerpt: |
      The health of any information ecosystem—a mind, a team, a society—can be diagnosed by the character of its flow... A Weaver’s task is not to shout louder into this storm, but to see the landscape of thought as a living watershed—to dredge the channels clogged with dogma, to calm the turbulent eddies of conflict, and to cultivate the conditions for clear, life-giving streams of coherence to merge, flow, and nourish the world.

        The Information Watershed maps to the concept of a potential landscape. System states (ideas, beliefs) are like marbles that roll along paths of least resistance (Wound Channels) towards local minima (stable paradigms). The landscape's shape is determined by the distribution of Coherence, analogous to a potential field.

        The claim that a 'true' idea is a geodesic on the coherence manifold suggests a direct analogy with General Relativity, where particles follow the straightest possible path through a curved manifold. A maximally coherent idea represents the most efficient and stable trajectory for a pattern to propagate through the system with minimal friction.

# Information Watershed

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An Information Watershed is the dynamic, n-dimensional manifold representing an information ecosystem. Its topography is defined by the distribution of Coherence (`Kτ`) and is constantly reshaped by the currents of communication, resonant synthesis, and the erosive force of Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). The paths of least resistance within this landscape are Wound Channels, which guide the propagation of ideas and constitute the system's memory.

## EFT-First Summary
No formal mapping has been adopted. The primary conceptual mapping is to potential landscapes in dynamical systems theory (e.g., Waddington's Epigenetic Landscape), where the flow of ideas follows paths of least resistance toward stable basins of attraction.
