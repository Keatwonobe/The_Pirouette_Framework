        This art, which replaces "Skating Resonance," addresses the minimization of loss. It is the practice of aligning a system's action so perfectly with the existing currents of the coherence manifold that it moves with near-perfect efficiency. This is the mastery of Laminar Flow (DYNA-001).

    To play a single, perfect note in effortless sync with the orchestra of the cosmos. It is the art of borrowing momentum from the river of time, becoming one with its current.
  law: |
    The net temporal pressure (V_Γ) exerted on a system approaches zero as the phase and frequency of its internal Ki pattern become isochronous with a dominant external flow channel. Efficiency (η_G) is maximized as the phase-lock error (Δφ) minimizes.
  philosophy: |
    Mastery is not the application of overwhelming force, but the achievement of perfect alignment. Geodesic Navigation replaces the paradigm of 'overcoming resistance' with 'eliminating it,' suggesting that the most effective action is often the one that feels effortless.

          Drive a system (the 'navigator') with a known Ki. Introduce an external, stable coherence flow (the 'current'). Sweep the navigator's Ki frequency and phase while measuring its net energy expenditure. A sharp, deep trough in energy expenditure indicates the point of isochronous resonance, where η_G peaks.

        Both describe a path of 'least effort' or 'straightest line' through a curved manifold (spacetime for GR, the coherence manifold for Pirouette). A system in Geodesic Navigation follows a path where no 'force' (Temporal Pressure) is felt, analogous to an object in free-fall.

# Geodesic Navigation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The practice of minimizing temporal pressure (V_Γ) and achieving near-perfect efficiency by phase-locking a system's intrinsic dynamics (its Ki) with a stable, external channel in the coherence manifold. This state of isochronous resonance allows the system to follow a geodesic path, effectively borrowing momentum from its temporal environment and reducing the cost of action to its absolute minimum.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory terms, Geodesic Navigation can be modeled as a system coupling its internal degrees of freedom (its 'clock') to a background field's gradient. By matching its own phase evolution to the background, it minimizes the interaction term in the Lagrangian, analogous to a particle following a geodesic in a curved spacetime to experience no net force. Operationally, this resembles a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) achieving a zero-error state, resulting in maximum power transfer efficiency.
