        3. Strategic Adaptability (The Signature of Ki Morphogenesis):
        This measures a team's ability to impose its preferred resonant pattern (`Ki`) on the game and to adapt that pattern when necessary.

  art: |
    The fencer who changes stance mid-lunge, the river that carves a new path around a boulder. It is the intelligence of a system not just executing a plan, but rewriting it in response to the world's changing rhythm.
  law: |
    A system's long-term coherence is proportional to its capacity to find and switch to new, more effective resonant patterns (`Ki`) faster than its environment or opponent can render its current pattern obsolete. A positive Pace Delta (`PD > 0`) is a leading indicator of victory.
  philosophy: |
    Survival is not about static perfection, but dynamic relevance. A coherent system that cannot adapt is a crystal, beautiful but brittle; one that can adapt is a living organism, capable of finding new forms of success in a perpetually novel world.
pirouette_definition: |
  Strategic Adaptability is a primary signature of system coherence, quantifying a system's capacity to both impose its preferred resonant pattern (`Ki`) on its environment and dynamically alter that pattern (`Ki Morphogenesis`) to maintain a geodesic of maximal coherence in response to environmental pressures or adversarial disruption (`Γ`). It is the measure of a system's intelligence in navigating the state space of possible coherent behaviors.

        outline: |
          An analyst observes a team's strategic execution over a defined time window (e.g., 5-10 minutes of game time). They assess the team's ability to control tempo, make effective in-game adjustments, neutralize opponent strategies, and introduce novel solutions, assigning a score from 1 (Rigid) to 10 (Visionary) based on the rubric in DOMA-099.
        expected_signals: [Proactive substitutions, successful tactical shifts, exploitation of newly identified opponent weaknesses, sustained control of game tempo.]
        pitfalls: [Confusing frantic, reactive changes with proactive adaptation; mistaking a single failed but novel strategy for low adaptability; overweighting a single brilliant play instead of the overall strategic posture.]

    excerpt: |
      Strategic Adaptability (The Signature of Ki Morphogenesis): This measures a team's ability to impose its preferred resonant pattern (`Ki`) on the game and to adapt that pattern when necessary. Observables: Successfully dictating the tempo; making effective in-game adjustments that neutralize the opponent's strategy; demonstrating a variety of ways to succeed. Diagnostic Insight: High adaptability shows a system that is not just stable, but intelligent—capable of finding new paths to coherence in a complex, changing landscape.

    excerpt: |
      The Morphogenesis Index (Measures Strategic Adaptability). 1-3 (Rigid): Sticks to a single game plan even when it is failing... 4-6 (Reactive): Makes adjustments, but often a step behind the opponent... 7-8 (Proactive): Successfully imposes its will and tempo on the game... 9-10 (Visionary): Appears to be "playing chess" while the opponent plays checkers; introduces novel strategies that the opponent cannot solve in time.

      justification: |
        Strategic Adaptability mirrors an adaptive control system, which modifies its own control parameters (the 'game plan' or `Ki`, analogous to θ) in real-time to optimize a performance metric (maintaining `Coherence`) in a dynamic environment with unknown or varying properties (the opponent's strategy). A high M_idx corresponds to an effective adaptation law `g(x,t)`.

  claims:
    - statement: "Over a large sample of games, a team with a consistently higher Morphogenesis Index score than its opponent will outperform the market-implied point spread."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A large-scale study shows no statistically significant correlation between the Pace Delta (`PD`) and beating the spread, or shows that a lower M_idx is positively correlated with winning."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The term 'Morphogenesis' is used in developmental biology to describe the process that causes an organism to develop its shape. The Pirouette usage is metaphorical, referring to the 'shaping' of a team's strategic pattern (`Ki`).]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from Resilience (Composure Under Pressure). Resilience is the ability to *withstand* pressure and maintain the current game plan. Adaptability is the ability to *change* the game plan in response to pressure or to proactively create a more advantageous one. A resilient but rigid team will lose to an adaptive one.
