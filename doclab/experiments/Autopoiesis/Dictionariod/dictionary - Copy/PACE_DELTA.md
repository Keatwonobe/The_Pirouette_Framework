        Step D: Calculate Pace Delta (PD):
        PD = (Morphogenesis_A) - (Morphogenesis_B)
        The Pace Delta is the difference in the Morphogenesis Index scores. A significant positive value for Team A suggests they will control the game's tempo.

  art: |
    The silent music of a game, revealing which conductor holds the baton. It is the palpable shift when one team's will begins to bend the rhythm of the contest to its own design, forcing the opponent to dance to an unfamiliar beat.
  law: |
    The difference between two opposing teams' Morphogenesis Index scores directly quantifies control of the game's strategic tempo. A sustained, non-zero value predicts which team is successfully imposing its pattern of play upon the other.
  philosophy: |
    Pace Delta measures not just action, but strategic *agency*. It isolates the capacity to adapt and impose form (morphogenesis) as the primary driver of tempo, distinguishing reactive adjustment from proactive, pattern-setting dominance.
pirouette_definition: |
  Pace Delta (PD) is a predictive output from the Sports Flow Resonance analysis that quantifies the differential in strategic adaptability between two competing teams. Calculated as the simple difference between their respective Morphogenesis Index scores, it provides a real-time measure of which team is controlling the game's tempo and imposing its strategic will.

        outline: |
          1. During a scheduled observation window (e.g., every 5 minutes of game time), an analyst assigns a Morphogenesis Index score (1-10) to Team A and Team B based on observed strategic adaptability.
          2. The Morphogenesis score for Team B is subtracted from the score for Team A.
          3. The resulting integer is the Pace Delta.
        expected_signals: [Positive PD: Team A is controlling tempo, forcing opponent to react., Negative PD: Team B is controlling tempo., PD near zero: Neither team has established tempo control.]
        pitfalls: [Analyst subjectivity in scoring Morphogenesis., Mistaking a short-term tactical success for long-term strategic control.]

      The Morphogenesis Index (Measures Strategic Adaptability):
      Purpose: To quantify a team's ability to control the game's resonant pattern (Ki) and adapt its strategy...
      7-8 (Proactive): Successfully imposes its will and tempo on the game; makes effective adjustments that neutralize the opponent's strengths.
      9-10 (Visionary): Appears to be "playing chess" while the opponent is playing checkers; introduces novel strategies that the opponent cannot solve in time.

      justification: |
        PD can be viewed as the difference in driving frequencies or intrinsic control parameters (Δω = ω₁ - ω₂) between two coupled nonlinear systems (teams). The team with the higher Morphogenesis score (and thus positive PD) is the 'driver,' forcing the other system to adapt to its frequency, fall into a dissonant state, or be overwhelmed. A PD of zero represents a symmetric or stalemated coupling.

  claims:
    - statement: "A team maintaining a positive Pace Delta (> +2) for a sustained period (e.g., 10+ minutes of game time) is statistically more likely to outperform the point spread over the remainder of the game."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A large-scale statistical analysis of games scored using the SFA-1.0 protocol shows no significant correlation between sustained PD and future point spread performance."

  disambiguation: |
    Pace Delta refers to strategic tempo, not the physical speed of play. A slow, deliberate team can have a high positive PD if they are successfully imposing that deliberate pace on a faster opponent, thereby disrupting the opponent's rhythm. The term measures control over the game's *pattern*, not its velocity.
