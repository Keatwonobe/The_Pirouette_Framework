  art: |
    The universe breathes, its expansion driven by the faint, residual springiness of time itself‚Äîthe echo of the elasticity that forges mass in the crucible of the present.
  law: |
    In the large-scale, low-coherence limit, Temporal Curvature is directly proportional to the effective cosmological constant (R_œÑ = 4Œõ_eff), manifesting as cosmic acceleration. This value evolves logarithmically with the scale factor `a`.
  philosophy: |
    Temporal Curvature completes the unification of mass and cosmic dynamics. It posits that the structure of matter and the expansion of spacetime are not separate phenomena but two regimes of a single underlying substrate elasticity, resolving Œõ's "unnaturalness" by framing it as a necessary residual effect.
pirouette_definition: |
  A scalar curvature term `R_œÑ` associated with the time substrate, defined via the unified invariant `mathfrak{M}^2 = Œì_stiff^2 + R_œÑ / (8œÄ G_eff)`. In the cosmic limit where local Œì-stiffness vanishes, `R_œÑ` becomes the dominant term, sourcing an effective cosmological constant `Œõ_eff = R_œÑ / 4`. It represents the macroscopic manifestation of the time substrate's residual elastic energy density.

        outline: |
          Measure the cosmic expansion history `H(z)` using Type-Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and CMB data. Fit the Friedmann equation `H¬≤ = (8œÄG/3)œÅ_m + Œõ_eff/3`. Infer `Œõ_eff` from the fit, then calculate `R_œÑ = 4Œõ_eff`. Search for logarithmic deviations in `Œõ_eff` with redshift `z` as a signature of its dynamic nature.

    excerpt: |
      The unified invariant ùîê¬≤ ensures that the energy budget is conserved between local stiffness and background curvature. A massive particle represents a localized peak in Œì-stiffness, which in turn induces a local deficit in the Temporal Curvature R_œÑ relative to the vacuum baseline.

        R_œÑ = 4Œõ_eff
      justification: |
        R_œÑ provides the energy density term in the Friedmann equations that drives cosmic acceleration, playing the same operational role as the standard cosmological constant Œõ. However, unlike a fundamental Œõ, R_œÑ is a dynamic quantity derived from substrate physics, predicting a slowly evolving equation of state.

    - target: Ricci Scalar (R)
      domain: GR
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        R_œÑ is dimensionally and conceptually analogous to the Ricci scalar of spacetime, but it specifically represents the intrinsic curvature of the temporal substrate. It is a scalar invariant of the substrate's geometry, which in turn acts as a source for spacetime curvature.
      references: []
      confidence: 0.6
  adopted:
    - target: 4Œõ (Cosmological Constant, scaled)
      rationale: The mapping R_œÑ = 4Œõ_eff is a direct, falsifiable claim made in XAP-006E (¬ß9) that connects R_œÑ to the observable cosmic acceleration. This provides the most concrete external anchor for the term.

  disambiguation: |
    R_œÑ (Temporal Curvature) is the intrinsic scalar curvature of the time substrate, a distinct entity from the spacetime curvature (R) described by GR. While R_œÑ acts as a source for R via the Friedmann equations, they are not the same quantity. R_œÑ is a property *of* the substrate, whereas R is a property *of* spacetime geometry.
