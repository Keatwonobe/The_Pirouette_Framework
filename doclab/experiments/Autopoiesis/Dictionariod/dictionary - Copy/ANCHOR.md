    A ship in a storm needs an anchor not to pull it, but to provide a single point of profound stability. The Anchor is a quiet harbor where the turbulent waters of a patient's system can calm, a tuning fork inviting a calmer note.
  law: |
    An Anchor's presence measurably reduces a patient's Coherence Fever by synchronizing breath and lowering resting heart rate. The Anchor's primary functions are: 1) to be a calm presence, 2) to listen with focused attention, and 3) to guard the recovery space from external stressors.
  philosophy: |
    The Anchor's role is not to 'do' or 'fix,' but to 'be.' By providing a stable, non-judgmental point of reference, the Anchor creates the conditions for an energetic surplus (positive Lagrangian ùìõ_p), enabling the patient's own healing wisdom to emerge and act.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Anchor is the functional role of a caregiver during a patient's high-turbulence recovery phase (e.g., Phase I post-op). The Anchor acts as an external source of coherence, providing a point of profound stability that allows the patient's system to transition from a state of chaos (high V_Œì) to calm. This is achieved not through direct intervention, but through three core functions: maintaining a calm presence, active listening, and protecting the recovery environment from stressors.

        outline: |
          The Anchor and patient collaboratively record two daily metrics: 1) The patient's resting heart rate (RHR), measured manually or with a device. 2) A subjective "in the flow" score (1-10). The Anchor acts as the Scribe, recording the values without judgment in a ledger.

      To the family member or friend assisting in this recovery: your role is one of the most powerful in this process. You are not a nurse or a doctor. You are an Anchor. A ship in a storm needs an anchor not to pull it, but to provide a single point of profound stability. That is your purpose. Your three primary functions are: To Be a Calm Presence, To Listen, and To Guard the Harbor.

    excerpt: |
      Helper's Role (The Resonant Partner): Do not just instruct; participate. Sit with the patient and do the breathing exercise with them. By synchronizing your breath, you are creating a shared rhythm, a resonant field of calm that they can latch onto. Your quiet, steady presence is a powerful medicine.

        The Anchor acts as a source of external damping on the 'oscillations' of the patient's psycho-physiological state (e.g., anxiety, pain spikes). Their calm presence reduces the amplitude and frequency of these turbulent fluctuations, allowing the system to settle to a lower energy state.

    In Pirouette, an Anchor is not a physical restraint or a primary financial partner. It is a functional role defined by providing psycho-physiological stability to another system, acting as a coherent reference point rather than an active interventionist.

# Anchor

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Anchor is the functional role of a caregiver during a patient's high-turbulence recovery phase (e.g., Phase I post-op). The Anchor acts as an external source of coherence, providing a point of profound stability that allows the patient's system to transition from a state of chaos (high V_Œì) to calm. This is achieved not through direct intervention, but through three core functions: maintaining a calm presence, active listening, and protecting the recovery environment from stressors.

## EFT-First Summary
No formal mapping to a field theory concept has been adopted. Conceptually, the Anchor can be analogized to an external damping force (like a damping coefficient Œ≥ in classical mechanics) that reduces the chaotic oscillations of a system, allowing it to settle into a stable, low-energy ground state conducive to healing.
