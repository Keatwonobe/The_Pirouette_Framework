  art: |
    A knot in time. A stable loop of coherence whose shadow, when turned once, is inverted, and must be turned twice to appear the same.
  law: |
    A closed path in configuration space corresponding to a 360° (2π) physical rotation imparts a geometric phase of π to the loop's state vector (Ψ → -Ψ). A 720° (4π) rotation is required for identity.
  philosophy: |
    The Ki loop grounds the existence of spin-½ matter not as a fundamental postulate, but as a stable topological consequence of a dynamic, coherent substrate. Matter is a persistent, tangled pattern, not a primordial point-particle.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable, localized topological defect in the time-first substrate, characterized by a non-trivial first homotopy group (π₁) in its configuration space. This topology results in a double-valued holonomy, where a 360° (2π) rotation of its local frame induces a sign change (Ψ → -Ψ) in its associated spinor field, and a 720° (4π) rotation is required to return it to the identity state. Its effective dynamics are described by the Dirac equation, and its mass arises from the energetic balance between its internal cohesion and the ambient temporal pressure (Γ).

        outline: |
          Infer the loop's spinor nature by observing interference patterns of its corresponding particles (e.g., electrons) after traversing paths that induce a relative 360° rotation. The characteristic phase shift of π (destructive interference) versus a 720° rotation (constructive interference) directly measures the double-valued holonomy. This is the principle behind neutron/electron interferometry experiments testing spin.

        The Ki loop's defining 720° rotational symmetry, its description by an anticommuting field (fermionic statistics), and its satisfaction of the Dirac equation make it a direct topological analogue of the standard model's spin-½ leptons.

# Ki loop

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A stable, localized topological defect in the time-first substrate, characterized by a non-trivial first homotopy group (π₁) in its configuration space. This topology results in a double-valued holonomy, where a 360° (2π) rotation of its local frame induces a sign change (Ψ → -Ψ) in its associated spinor field, and a 720° (4π) rotation is required to return it to the identity state. Its effective dynamics are described by the Dirac equation, and its mass arises from the energetic balance between its internal cohesion and the ambient temporal pressure (Γ).

## EFT-First Summary
The Ki loop is the Pirouette Framework's topological model for the Dirac spinor field (Ψ), representing fundamental fermions like the electron. Its defining 720° rotational symmetry is not postulated but emerges from a stable 'knot' in the substrate. Its dynamics follow the Dirac equation, and its mass is a derived quantity, providing a geometric origin for spin-½ matter fields. This maps directly to the description of electrons and other leptons in Quantum Field Theory.
