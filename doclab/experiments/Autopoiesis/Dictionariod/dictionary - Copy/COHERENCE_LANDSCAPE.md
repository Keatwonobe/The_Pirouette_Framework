        This instrument provides the primary method for analyzing the stability and evolution of any system within the Pirouette Framework. It fundamentally reframes the legacy approach... by replacing the classical concept of a potential energy landscape with the **Coherence Landscape**.

    A map of a system's potential for grace. Its peaks are not mountains of matter, but summits of elegant resonance where a system's song rings truest against the noise of the world.
  law: |
    A system's state evolves along the path of steepest ascent on its Coherence Landscape, seeking local maxima of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`∇𝓛_p(S) = 0`) which represent stable or metastable attractors.
  philosophy: |
    This reframes system evolution from a passive descent into minimal-energy states to an active, creative ascent towards states of maximal internal harmony, resonance, and expressive efficiency. It replaces a cartography of endings with a geography of becoming.
pirouette_definition: |
  A scalar field, `𝓛_p(S)`, defined over a system's state space `S`, where the elevation at any point is the value of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`). The landscape's topography governs the system's dynamics: peaks are stable attractors, gradients (`∇𝓛_p`) define the most probable paths of evolution, and saddles represent transition states between attractors.

          1. **Define State Space:** Identify and parameterize the system's relevant degrees of freedom (`S`).
          2. **Translate to Pirouette Fields:** Use the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014) to define functions for Temporal Coherence `K_τ(S)` and Temporal Pressure `V_Γ(S)` for all points in the state space.
          3. **Construct Landscape:** Calculate `𝓛_p(S) = K_τ(S) - V_Γ(S)` for all `S` to generate the scalar field.
          4. **Analyze Geometry:** Use computational methods to find maxima (attractors), saddle points (transition states), and the gradient field `∇𝓛_p(S)` (paths of evolution).
        expected_signals: [Identification of local maxima corresponding to observed stable states, characterization of energy barriers for state transitions.]
        pitfalls: [Incorrectly defined state space (missing degrees of freedom), inaccurate Fractal Bridge translation for `K_τ` or `V_Γ` terms, insufficient computational resolution to find all relevant features.]

    excerpt: |
      In the old view, systems were seen as marbles rolling downhill to find points of minimum energy—stable, but lifeless, valleys. This instrument recasts that picture entirely. Systems are not seeking rest; they are striving for expression. They evolve by climbing a landscape of coherence, seeking peaks of elegant, stable, and efficient resonance.
  - module: DOMA-139
    excerpt: |
      The Coherence Landscape is a scalar field defined over a system's state space, where the "elevation" at any point is the value of the Lagrangian itself: `Elevation = 𝓛_p(S) = K_τ(S) - V_Γ(S)`. Identify Attractors (Peaks): Locate the local maxima of `𝓛_p(S)`. These peaks are the system's stable or metastable states—its points of highest efficiency and most elegant resonance.

        Classical: `F = -∇V`, stable states at `min(V)`.
        Pirouette: `F_p ∝ +∇𝓛_p`, stable states at `max(𝓛_p)`.
      justification: |
        The Coherence Landscape is a direct inversion of the classical potential energy landscape concept. Stable states are maxima (peaks) of `𝓛_p` rather than minima (valleys) of potential energy `V`. This reframes dynamics from energy minimization to coherence maximization, where the driving "force" is an ascent toward resonance, not a descent from potential.

        Evolutionary dynamics seek local maxima of fitness.
      justification: |
        The Coherence Landscape is analogous to the fitness landscape in evolutionary theory, where elevation represents the fitness of a genotype. Both models predict that the system (a population or a Pirouette system) will evolve "uphill" towards peaks, which represent stable strategies or states. Coherence plays the role of fitness.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a potential *energy* landscape, stability in a *coherence* landscape is found at peaks (maxima), not valleys (minima). A system "climbs" toward coherence; it does not "fall" to rest. The elevation represents resonance and efficiency, not stored potential energy.

# Coherence Landscape

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A scalar field, `𝓛_p(S)`, defined over a system's state space `S`, where the elevation at any point is the value of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`). The landscape's topography governs the system's dynamics: peaks are stable attractors, gradients (`∇𝓛_p`) define the most probable paths of evolution, and saddles represent transition states between attractors.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Landscape is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the classical potential energy landscape, but with inverted stability criteria. Instead of seeking minimal energy in potential wells, systems evolve towards maximal coherence at landscape peaks where the coherence gradient is zero (`∇𝓛_p=0`). This recasts dynamics as a gradient *ascent* driven by resonance and efficiency, rather than a descent driven by potential forces. The model is conceptually similar to fitness landscapes in evolutionary biology.
