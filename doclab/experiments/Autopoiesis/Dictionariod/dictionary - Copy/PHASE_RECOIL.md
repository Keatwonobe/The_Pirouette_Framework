        The Pressuron is not a boson in the usual sense—it is the **phase recoil of the universe** when mass bends time faster than coherence can repair itself.

  art: |
    A particle is not a thing, but a pulse of time. It is the echo of spacetime's fabric snapping back into place; to measure it is to catch the universe inhaling between its own heartbeats.
  law: |
    The phase recoil of spacetime coherence under extreme temporal curvature manifests as a transient, pseudoscalar resonance (Γ) with a mass (mΓ ≈ 17 MeV/c²) and leptonic coupling (gΓ ∝ mℓ²) that is detectable via its e⁺e⁻ decay channel.
  philosophy: |
    Phase Recoil reframes elementary particles not as static objects, but as transient, dissipative responses of a background field to stress. It posits that some 'particles' are not matter, but echoes of spacetime's own self-regulation.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dynamic, localized response of the background temporal-pressure field to a rate of temporal curvature (mass density) that exceeds its coherence propagation speed. This recoil manifests as a transient, propagating pseudoscalar excitation (the Pressuron, Γ), which dissipates the temporal stress by decaying into conventional matter fields.

      We sought a particle and found a pulse of time. The Pressuron is not a boson in the usual sense—it is the **phase recoil of the universe** when mass bends time faster than coherence can repair itself. To measure it is to catch the universe inhaling between its own heartbeats.

    excerpt: |
      The Γ-particle represents the *breathing mode* of time’s fabric. Its pseudoscalar nature stems from **phase inversion of temporal curvature**, mirroring the alternation of compression and rarefaction in a standing wave. Decay into matter is thus the literal dissipation of coherent time-pressure into the particle sea—a physical analog to a coherence collapse.

        Like a phonon, which is a quantized mode of vibration in a crystal lattice, the Pressuron is framed as a quantized mode of excitation in the 'lattice' of spacetime in response to stress. It is a collective excitation, not a fundamental constituent.

      justification: |
        Cherenkov radiation is emitted when a charged particle exceeds the local phase velocity of light in a medium. Phase Recoil is conceptually analogous, occurring when mass 'exceeds' the coherence propagation speed of time, causing the temporal field to 'radiate' a Pressuron.

      confidence: 0.6
  adopted:
    - target: Phonon (quantized lattice vibration)
      rationale: The phonon analogy best captures the idea of the Pressuron as a collective, emergent excitation of a background medium (the temporal-pressure field) rather than a fundamental particle.

    `Phase Recoil` in the Pirouette context specifically refers to the response of the temporal field to excessive curvature, not the kinematic recoil of particles in a collision. It is a field-level phenomenon, not a momentum-conservation effect.

# Phase Recoil

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A dynamic, localized response of the background temporal-pressure field to a rate of temporal curvature (mass density) that exceeds its coherence propagation speed. This recoil manifests as a transient, propagating pseudoscalar excitation (the Pressuron, Γ), which dissipates the temporal stress by decaying into conventional matter fields.

## EFT-First Summary
Phase Recoil is a mechanism proposing a new light pseudoscalar boson (Γ) around 17 MeV. This boson arises from a novel "temporal pressure" field's response to high mass density. Analogous to a phonon being a quantized lattice vibration, the Γ particle is a quantized excitation of this temporal field, coupling derivatively to leptons with a strength proportional to their mass, potentially explaining the muon g-2 anomaly.
