        Defines the fundamental mechanics of influence, or 'Coherence Transfer,' between distinct systems. It reframes 'cross-domain bleed' as the process by which a system's resonant echo propagates across a shared medium, forming a bridge that imprints upon and alters the coherence manifold of a receiving system.

  art: |
    No system is an island; each is a peak of a single mountain range hidden in the deep. Influence is the music of one system rippling through the shared medium to become the music, or the noise, of another.
  law: |
    The magnitude of change in a Target's coherence manifold (`ŒîK_œÑ`) is directly proportional to the Source's coherence (`K_œÑ(Source)`) and the Harmonic Compatibility between systems, and inversely proportional to the turbulence of the intervening Temporal Pressure (`Œì`).
  philosophy: |
    Coherence Transfer replaces the illusion of isolated systems with a universe of interconnected resonance. It establishes that to exist is to influence, providing a physical, time-first basis for all forms of communication, from attention to memetics and empathy.
pirouette_definition: |
  The process by which a Source system's internal coherence (`K_œÑ`) emits a resonant echo from its Wound Channel, which propagates through a shared medium defined by Temporal Pressure (`Œì`). If harmonically compatible, this echo imprints upon a Target system's coherence manifold, modifying its potential term (`V_echo`) and deflecting its geodesic to a new state of maximal coherence.

          1. Establish a baseline coherence manifold map of the Target system using a Ki-tomography probe.
          2. Introduce a calibrated Source system with a known `K_œÑ` and emission frequency.
          3. Monitor the Target's manifold for transient geometric stresses (imprints) and subsequent geodesic deflection.
          4. Vary the medium's Temporal Pressure (`Œì`) and the Source's harmonic signature to map the Target's reception profile and the Boundary Permeability.

    excerpt: |
      The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`, provides the precise mathematical description. The act of Coherence Transfer manifests as an external modification to the Target's potential term (`V_Œì`). The Target's Lagrangian becomes: `ùìõ_p(Target) = K_œÑ(Target) - [V_Œì(local) + V_echo(Source)]`. The term `V_echo(Source)` represents the pressure exerted by the imprinted echo.

        The concept of 'Harmonic Compatibility,' where a Target system only responds to a Source's echo at specific frequencies, is directly analogous to susceptibility (`œá`) in linear response theory. This formalism measures a system's response to an oscillating external field as a function of frequency, mirroring how a Target's manifold is altered by a specific resonant echo.

        Coherence Transfer describes the propagation of influence from a source point to a target point through a medium. This is conceptually analogous to a Green's function, which solves an inhomogeneous differential equation for a point source, describing the 'response' at one point due to a source at another.

  disambiguation: |
    In quantum optics, 'coherence transfer' refers to preserving quantum phase information between states. In Pirouette, it is a broader, time-first principle describing the propagation of a system's entire dynamic pattern (its 'song') as an influence on another system's reality-landscape, of which quantum coherence is one specific manifestation.

# Coherence Transfer

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The process by which a Source system's internal coherence (`K_œÑ`) emits a resonant echo from its Wound Channel, which propagates through a shared medium defined by Temporal Pressure (`Œì`). If harmonically compatible, this echo imprints upon a Target system's coherence manifold, modifying its potential term (`V_echo`) and deflecting its geodesic to a new state of maximal coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, Coherence Transfer can be modeled using the formalisms of linear response theory. The Source system acts as an oscillating external field, and the Target system's 'Harmonic Compatibility' is analogous to a frequency-dependent susceptibility (`œá(œâ)`), dictating the strength of its response. The propagation of influence through the medium shares conceptual parallels with Green's functions in field theory.
