        A system's Geodesic Blueprint is its path of maximal coherence. It is the "null template" against which all real-world performance is measured, and it can be derived in three primary ways...

    A healthy system sings a clear and predictable song. The Geodesic Blueprint is the sheet music for this song of health, a perfect score against which any dissonant note or missed beat is instantly revealed.
  law: |
    A system's deviation from its Geodesic Blueprint is directly proportional to its loss of coherence. The blueprint itself is the unique trajectory that maximizes the action integral of the system's Pirouette Lagrangian.
  philosophy: |
    To find a flaw, do not search for the flaw; search for the absence of perfection. The Geodesic Blueprint establishes the standard of perfection, reframing diagnostics as a measurement of deviation from an ideal rather than a search for infinite failure modes.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Geodesic Blueprint is the spatiotemporal trajectory, Œ≥‚ÇÄ(t), of a system that maximizes the action of its Pirouette Lagrangian, S[Œ≥] = ‚à´ ùìõ_p dt. It serves as the canonical reference model of systemic health, representing a state of maximal coherence and Laminar Flow. All observed system states are compared against this blueprint to quantify deviation (Œîùìõ) and diagnose pathology.

  disambiguation: |
    While sharing the mathematical root of an extremal path from variational principles, the Pirouette 'geodesic' refers to a trajectory through the system's abstract state space that maximizes coherence, not necessarily a physical path through spacetime. It is a geodesic on the manifold of system states, where the metric is induced by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

# Geodesic Blueprint

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Geodesic Blueprint is the spatiotemporal trajectory, Œ≥‚ÇÄ(t), of a system that maximizes the action of its Pirouette Lagrangian, S[Œ≥] = ‚à´ ùìõ_p dt. It serves as the canonical reference model of systemic health, representing a state of maximal coherence and Laminar Flow. All observed system states are compared against this blueprint to quantify deviation (Œîùìõ) and diagnose pathology.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Geodesic Blueprint is analogous to a **reference trajectory** in Optimal Control Theory. It defines the ideal, desired path for a system's state variables over time. System health is then measured as the inverse of the "tracking error" or deviation from this reference path. The blueprint is the solution to a variational problem that maximizes system coherence, just as an optimal trajectory minimizes a cost function.
