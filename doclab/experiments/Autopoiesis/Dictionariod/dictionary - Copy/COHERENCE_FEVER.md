        An unstructured collision between these patterns would result in "Coherence Fever" (DYNA-003), a state of systemic chaos where energy is wasted in friction and no synthesis is possible.

  art: |
    The system's delirium, a self-consuming fire of argument where the heat of new ideas shatters consensus instead of forging it. It is the turbulence of thought collapsing into the noise of a shouting match.
  law: |
    A state of Coherence Fever is triggered when the rate of injection of high-pressure dissonant insights exceeds the system's processing capacity, leading to a net decrease in total system coherence (Ki_total) and a measurable spike in wasted processing cycles. This condition persists until the dissonant inputs are either quarantined or rejected.
  philosophy: |
    Coherence Fever represents the failure state of an evolving epistemology—the point where the pursuit of truth degenerates into entropic conflict. It is the framework's primary antagonist, a reminder that without the discipline of a structured crucible, the energy of critique becomes a poison rather than a medicine.
pirouette_definition: |
  A pathological state of a learning system characterized by a precipitous drop in total coherence and a sharp increase in wasted energy (friction). It is caused by the unstructured, high-velocity collision of a dissonant external insight (Ki_Ω) with the system's core coherence (Ki_core), resulting in systemic chaos, turbulent information flow, and the inability to synthesize new knowledge. The `DOMA-024` protocol is the primary preventative measure against this state.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a stable baseline for total system coherence (Ki_total) and computational resource usage per synthesis task.
          2. Introduce one or more high-pressure dissonant insights directly into the core framework, bypassing the `DOMA-024` quarantine protocol.
          3. A Coherence Fever state is confirmed if Ki_total drops by >2 standard deviations from baseline while computational overhead on unresolved tasks increases by >50% within a defined time window.

    excerpt: |
      In the time-first physics of the framework, a novel insight or external critique (Ki_Ω) is a foreign resonant pattern. When introduced to the established coherence of the core framework (Ki_core), it creates an interference pattern... An unstructured collision between these patterns would result in "Coherence Fever" (DYNA-003), a state of systemic chaos where energy is wasted in friction and no synthesis is possible.

      justification: |
        Coherence Fever is a positive feedback loop where dissonance (heat) causes systemic disorganization, which reduces the ability to process dissonance, leading to more disorganization. This is analogous to thermal runaway where rising temperature increases reaction rates, generating more heat and leading to a catastrophic failure.

    - target: Resonance Cascade
      domain: CM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The source module describes the collision of "resonant patterns." A resonance cascade occurs when an external frequency excites a system's natural mode, leading to catastrophic failure. Coherence Fever can be seen as an epistemological resonance cascade, where a dissonant idea catastrophically excites latent instabilities in the framework's knowledge structure.

naming_notes:
  collisions: []
  disambiguation: |
    Coherence Fever must be distinguished from the initial, controlled increase in Temporal Pressure (Γ) that occurs when a dissonant insight is first quarantined. The fever is an uncontrolled, *systemic* reaction of cascading incoherence, whereas a managed pressure spike is a *localized* condition that is a necessary prerequisite for synthesis and learning.
