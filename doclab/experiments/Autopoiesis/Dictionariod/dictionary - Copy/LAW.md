        Law (The Thread of Stability): Law is the mechanism that creates and maintains the collective Wound Channel (CORE-011). It codifies the successful resonances of the past into stable, predictable structures—constitutions, traditions, ethics, and social contracts. It is the culture's memory, its ability to say "This works."

  art: |
    The riverbank that gives the torrent its form and power. The rigid score that makes the music possible. The cage whose bars I must bend or break to sing a new song.
  law: |
    A system's structural inertia is proportional to the fidelity and density with which it codifies past successful states into its governing constraints (constitutions, traditions, ethics).
  philosophy: |
    Law provides the stable, predictable foundation necessary for a culture to endure and build upon itself. Its telos is the preservation of coherence against temporal pressure, but its pathological excess is the brittle stagnation that precedes collapse.
pirouette_definition: |
  The cultural thread of coherence that codifies past successful resonances into stable, predictable structures. As one of the three threads woven on the Triaxial Loom, Law functions as a culture's structural memory, creating and maintaining the collective Wound Channel through constitutions, traditions, ethics, and social contracts. It provides the inertia necessary to withstand temporal pressure, but risks becoming a source of stagnation if it chokes the other threads of Art and Philosophy.

        outline: |
          1. Identify a culture's core governing structures (e.g., constitution, primary legal code, key religious texts, documented social contracts).
          2. Calculate the rate of amendment or high-level revision over a significant time period (e.g., per century).
          3. Quantify the legal system's reliance on precedent (e.g., ratio of case law to statutory law).
          4. Survey public adherence and trust in these institutions.
          5. Normalize these values to produce a composite index, where higher scores indicate a stronger Law thread.
        expected_signals: [Low legislative amendment rates, high judicial precedent stability, high public compliance with social norms, low variance in institutional forms over time.]
        pitfalls: [Confusing brittleness with stability; a stagnant system may score high before shattering. Overlooking the power of unwritten or informal laws and traditions.]

    excerpt: |
      Law (The Thread of Stability): Law is the mechanism that creates and maintains the collective Wound Channel. It codifies the successful resonances of the past into stable, predictable structures—constitutions, traditions, ethics, and social contracts. It is the culture's memory, its ability to say "This works." A culture with a strong legal thread possesses the inertia to endure.
  - module: DOMA-192
    excerpt: |
      A society of only Law is a brittle tyranny. A society of only Art is an unsustainable chaos. A society of only Philosophy is a sterile abstraction. Progress halts, and the culture becomes vulnerable to collapse.

      justification: |
        Law establishes a potential landscape for social action, where traditions and statutes represent deep potential wells (stable states). Deviating from these norms requires an input of social energy (activation energy) to overcome the "force" of the law. The structure of Law defines the basin of attraction for the system's dynamics.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, "Law" is a much broader concept than legislative statutes. It encompasses the entire set of a culture's stabilizing structures, including unwritten traditions, ethical norms, religious dogma, and social contracts. It is the system's complete structural memory, not just its legal code.
