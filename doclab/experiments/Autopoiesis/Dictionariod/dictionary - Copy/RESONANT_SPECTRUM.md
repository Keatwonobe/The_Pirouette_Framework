    To truly know a cello, you must learn to distinguish the deep, resonant voice of the wood itself from the clear, soaring notes that fly from its strings. One is the sound of its being; the other is the sound of its song. They are not two different things, but two expressions of a single, vibrant whole.
  law: |
    A system's temporal signature is a composition of its constituent resonances. The total temporal coherence (KœÑ) is the sum of its structural and propagating components, measurable against the potential of ambient Temporal Pressure (VŒì), directly quantifying the terms of the Pirouette Lagrangian.
  philosophy: |
    To understand a system, one must move beyond observing what it *is* to analyzing what it *does*. The Resonant Spectrum provides the foundational tool for this shift, deconstructing a system's composite 'song' into its fundamental notes to reveal the interplay of its internal identity and its external interactions.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Resonant Spectrum is an analytical framework and protocol for decomposing a system's temporal signature into its constituent geometric resonances. It transforms time-series data via time-frequency analysis (e.g., CWT) into a spectrum whose horizontal axis is a library of fundamental `Ki` geometries and whose vertical axis is the resonant amplitude of each geometry. The protocol distinguishes between low-frequency, persistent Structural Coherence (self-identity) and higher-frequency, transient Propagating Coherence (interaction), allowing for the direct measurement of the terms in the Pirouette Lagrangian (KœÑ and VŒì).
operational_definition:
  units: The horizontal axis is a categorical index of `Ki` geometries (dimensionless). The vertical axis (Resonant Amplitude) is typically normalized to be dimensionless, representing the degree of contribution, or may inherit the units of the power spectral density of the input signal (e.g., V¬≤/Hz).

        outline: |
          1. Ingest a system's time-series data (temporal signature).
          2. Apply a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) or similar time-frequency analysis to generate a spectrogram.
          3. Identify persistent, high-energy ridges in the spectrogram as coherent `Ki` patterns, and the low-energy floor as ambient Œì.
          4. Classify each `Ki` ridge as Structural (low-œâ, narrow-Œîœâ, high-Œît) or Propagating (higher-œâ, broader-Œîœâ, lower-Œît).
          5. Quantify diagnostic metrics (œâ_k, Œîœâ, Œît) for each resonance to populate the spectrum and inform the Lagrangian.
        expected_signals: [Bright, continuous "ridges" on a spectrogram indicating coherent Ki, A low-intensity, broadband "floor" indicating Œì]
        pitfalls: [Choosing an inappropriate mother wavelet for the CWT, which can distort or hide geometric forms, Misclassifying noise artifacts as transient propagating coherences, Over-fitting the "Library of Forms" to the data.]

    excerpt: |
      No complex system is monolithic. Its identity and behavior are emergent properties arising from a nested hierarchy of simpler, more fundamental resonances. The Resonant Spectrum is the primary tool for understanding this composition. It provides a method for taking the observed temporal signature of a complex system and identifying the fundamental `Ki` geometries that contribute to its overall song.

    excerpt: |
      Structural Coherence is the audible expression of the Gladiator Force. These are the deep, self-reinforcing harmonics that hold the system together, defining its identity and inertia. Propagating Coherence is the signature of The Current and the Compass. These are the rhythms of communication, motion, and response‚Äîthe means by which the system projects itself and perceives others.

      This protocol is the critical bridge between observation and prediction, allowing for the direct measurement of the terms in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`. This analysis transforms the abstract Lagrangian into a measurable diagnostic chart, allowing a Weaver to model a system's past and chart the geodesics of its most likely future.

        The protocol explicitly names CWT as the method for transforming the time-series signal into a time-frequency representation (spectrogram) from which resonances are identified. This transformation is the core operational step of the analysis, making CWT a direct mathematical counterpart.

# Resonant Spectrum

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Resonant Spectrum is an analytical framework and protocol for decomposing a system's temporal signature into its constituent geometric resonances. It transforms time-series data via time-frequency analysis (e.g., CWT) into a spectrum whose horizontal axis is a library of fundamental `Ki` geometries and whose vertical axis is the resonant amplitude of each geometry. The protocol distinguishes between low-frequency, persistent Structural Coherence (self-identity) and higher-frequency, transient Propagating Coherence (interaction), allowing for the direct measurement of the terms in the Pirouette Lagrangian (KœÑ and VŒì).

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Resonant Spectrum is analogous to a sophisticated signal processing technique like a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) applied to time-series data. It separates a signal into a set of basis functions, but instead of simple sinusoids, the bases are archetypal "geometric forms." Conceptually, this mirrors a Normal Mode Decomposition in classical mechanics, identifying the fundamental modes of a system's dynamic behavior. It provides a direct method to quantify the kinetic-like (`K_œÑ`) and potential-like (`V_Œì`) terms of the Pirouette Lagrangian, making it a bridge from phenomenological data to the framework's core theoretical model.
