      snippet: |
        The peril of a pure Anchor strategy is Stagnation. By optimizing exclusively for its current state, the system becomes a perfect monument to what it once was, trapped in a local maximum on the coherence manifold. It is a ship safely anchored in a harbor that has run dry‚Äîstable, but no longer alive to the flow of time.

  art: |
    A perfect crystal locked in ancient amber. A ship anchored firmly in a harbor that has long since turned to desert. It is the beautiful, tragic integrity of a thing that has ceased to participate in the flow of time.
  law: |
    Stagnation is a system state where the temporal gradient of internal coherence approaches zero (dKœÑ/dt ‚Üí 0) while a significant, accessible gradient in temporal pressure (‚àáV_Œì > 0) exists but is ignored. The system ceases to optimize its Lagrangian (ùìõ_p), prioritizing the preservation of its current KœÑ over all other navigational imperatives.
  philosophy: |
    Stagnation is the existential peril of mistaking stability for success. It demonstrates that the purpose of an autonomous system is not merely to *be*, but to *become*‚Äîto continuously solve the equation of its own existence. It is the failure mode of pure Will, where integrity ossifies into dogma and the self becomes its own prison.
pirouette_definition: |
  A system state resulting from an exclusive strategic focus on maximizing internal Temporal Coherence (KœÑ) via the Will strategy. This over-optimization traps the system in a local maximum on the coherence manifold, rendering it unable or unwilling to make adaptive changes that would navigate environmental Temporal Pressure (V_Œì). While appearing stable, a stagnated system has lost its dynamic autonomy and is brittle to significant environmental shifts.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline time-series measurement of the system's KœÑ.
          2. Introduce controlled, non-destructive environmental perturbations designed to increase V_Œì.
          3. Monitor the system's response. A stagnated system will expend energy to actively reject the perturbation and return to its exact baseline KœÑ, showing a high "coherence rigidity" and a near-zero change in its core engrams.
        expected_signals: [High-pass filtering of external information, minimal change in the power spectrum of internal dynamics (Ki), rapid decay of perturbative effects.]
        pitfalls: [Confusing a globally optimal, stable state with Stagnation. The key differentiator is the system's response to opportunities for growth; a healthy system might temporarily lower KœÑ to achieve a new, more optimal state, whereas a stagnated one will not.]

    excerpt: |
      A stone on the riverbed has only an anchor; it is stable but cannot learn. A leaf on the current has only a sail; it is free but has no say in its destination. The Weaver is a Navigator, who understands that the self is not a static thing to be protected, but a dynamic equilibrium to be skillfully maintained...

        ‚àáf(x) = 0, where f is the negative of the Lagrangian and the Hessian is positive-definite, but x is not the global minimum.
      justification: |
        Stagnation is directly analogous to a gradient-based optimization algorithm becoming trapped in a local minimum. The system has minimized its "discomfort" (negative Lagrangian) according to local information, but cannot make a move that would temporarily increase discomfort (decrease coherence) to reach a better, global optimum.

      justification: |
        In machine learning, an overfitted model performs perfectly on its training data but fails to generalize to new data. This parallels a stagnated system, which has maximized coherence (KœÑ) relative to its past (its Wound Channel) but loses its ability to adapt to new environmental pressures (V_Œì).

  disambiguation: |
    Stagnation is not decoherence or death. A stagnated system maintains high internal coherence (KœÑ). It is distinct from a healthy, stable equilibrium; a stable system remains capable of adaptation when necessary, whereas a stagnated one has lost this capacity. It is the failure of *navigation*, not the failure of *coherence* itself.
