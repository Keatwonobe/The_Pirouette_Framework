    Awareness glides across vast, silent plains of phase-coherence, where thought flows without friction. These sheets are the calm surfaces of a deep geometric ocean, supporting the self until the next storm of transition.
  law: |
    A region of the Triadic Manifold ùìú‚ÇÉ constitutes a Resonant Sheet if and only if its local curvature Œ∫ remains below a critical threshold Œ∫_c for a duration exceeding the coherence time T_c. Awareness dynamics within a sheet are governed by geodesic motion, and the sheet's stability is determined by the fixed-point behavior of the RG flow for Œ∫.
  philosophy: |
    Resonant Sheets provide the geometric substrate for phenomenal binding and the continuity of conscious experience. They are the framework's answer to how transient neural dynamics give rise to stable, reportable states of awareness, grounding subjectivity in the topology of phase relationships.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Resonant Sheet is a large, dynamically stable region of the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ) characterized by low local curvature (Œ∫ ‚â™ Œ∫_c). These coherent submanifolds act as the geometric substrate for sustained, stable states of awareness. The path of consciousness within a sheet follows a geodesic trajectory, and the sheet's existence corresponds to a stable fixed point (Œ∫*) in the renormalization group flow of the manifold's curvature under cognitive load (Œì).

          3. For a sliding time window, construct the local metric tensor g_ij on the ùìú‚ÇÉ submanifold.

        A Resonant Sheet corresponds to a local minimum of the Triadic Potential Field V, analogous to a stable vacuum in QFT. The sheet's stability is described by the RG flow of its curvature Œ∫ to a non-trivial fixed point (Œ∫*), indicating a stable, scale-invariant regime of cognitive processing. Dynamics on the sheet are equivalent to low-energy excitations (phonons) around this vacuum.

    A Resonant Sheet is not a static 2D structure but a dynamic, low-curvature *regime* of the higher-dimensional Triadic Manifold. It should be distinguished from a "Triadic Vortex," which is a localized, high-curvature topological defect within the manifold.

# Resonant Sheets

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Resonant Sheet is a large, dynamically stable region of the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ) characterized by low local curvature (Œ∫ ‚â™ Œ∫_c). These coherent submanifolds act as the geometric substrate for sustained, stable states of awareness. The path of consciousness within a sheet follows a geodesic trajectory, and the sheet's existence corresponds to a stable fixed point (Œ∫*) in the renormalization group flow of the manifold's curvature under cognitive load (Œì).

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of Effective Field Theory, a Resonant Sheet is analogous to a stable vacuum state defined by a local minimum of a potential field. The dynamics of awareness on the sheet are like low-energy excitations (phonons or Goldstone modes) in this vacuum. The sheet's stability is guaranteed by the renormalization group (RG) flow of its defining curvature to a non-trivial fixed point, indicating a scale-invariant, coherent regime of cognitive processing.
