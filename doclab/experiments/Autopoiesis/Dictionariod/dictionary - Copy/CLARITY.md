        Clarity is the measure of this internal coherence—the purity and stability of the projected pattern. A clear goal is a sharp, resonant signal that carves a well-defined channel.

    A single, unwavering note held in the mind's silence; the perfect seed from which the future's geometry will grow.
  law: |
    The geometric definition of a resulting Channel of Intent is directly proportional to the Clarity of the initial projection; a decrease in Clarity manifests as increased noise and diffusion in the `V_Γ` gradient.
  philosophy: |
    Clarity is the primordial act of agency. Before a world can be sculpted, a clear vision of the final form must be held, unblemished by internal conflict or ambiguity.
pirouette_definition: |
  Clarity (κ_c) is a dimensionless measure of the internal coherence and temporal stability of a projected intent. It quantifies the signal-to-noise ratio of the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) as it impresses a Future Wound Channel (CORE-011) onto the local manifold. High Clarity corresponds to a pure, resonant pattern that carves a sharply-defined 'coherence well' in the `V_Γ` landscape, while low Clarity results in a diffuse, noisy projection that fails to establish a stable geodesic for willed action.

        outline: |
          Clarity is not measured directly but is inferred from the geometric properties of the resulting Channel of Intent. Using Flow Diagnostics (DYNA-001), an observer analyzes the system's trajectory after a willed act. The sharpness of the gradient (∇(V_Γ)) and the minimal deviation of the system's path from the projected geodesic provide a quantitative measure of the initial Clarity.

    excerpt: |
      A willed act begins with a coherent intent. Clarity is the measure of this internal coherence—the purity and stability of the projected pattern. A clear goal is a sharp, resonant signal that carves a well-defined channel. A vague or conflicted intention is a noisy, dissonant projection that diffuses without effect. A strong Will begins with a single, unwavering note.

    excerpt: |
      Turbulent Will (Conflict): The agent projects multiple, competing Future Wound Channels. The coherence manifold is warped into a chaotic landscape with no clear geodesic. The agent expends immense energy moving in circles, fighting against its own divided intentions. This is the geometry of self-sabotage.

        Clarity is framed as the purity of a projected 'signal' (the intent) against internal 'noise' (conflicting directives, ambiguity). High Clarity, like high SNR, ensures the signal can be effectively acted upon, carving a clean channel rather than being lost in noise.

        Clarity maps to the orderliness of a system's internal state. A state of high Clarity is analogous to a low-temperature, low-entropy system where a single microstate (the specific intent) dominates. Low Clarity (conflict, noise) is analogous to a high-temperature state with many competing microstates.

    Distinguish from Intensity. Clarity is the *coherence* or *purity* of the projected intent (the signal quality), whereas Intensity is the *amplitude* of the projection (the signal strength). A weak but clear signal (low Intensity, high Clarity) can be more effective than a strong but noisy one (high Intensity, low Clarity).

# Clarity

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Clarity (κ_c) is a dimensionless measure of the internal coherence and temporal stability of a projected intent. It quantifies the signal-to-noise ratio of the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) as it impresses a Future Wound Channel (CORE-011) onto the local manifold. High Clarity corresponds to a pure, resonant pattern that carves a sharply-defined 'coherence well' in the `V_Γ` landscape, while low Clarity results in a diffuse, noisy projection that fails to establish a stable geodesic for willed action.

## EFT-First Summary
In an information-theoretic mapping, Clarity (κ_c) is analogous to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of a control signal. It describes the purity of an agent's intended state projection against a background of internal noise (e.g., conflicting directives, thermal fluctuations). A high-Clarity state (high SNR) allows for the efficient and precise imprinting of a desired dynamic pathway onto a system's phase space, minimizing entropic losses and off-path deviations.
