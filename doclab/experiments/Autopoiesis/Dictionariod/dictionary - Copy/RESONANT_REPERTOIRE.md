  art: |
    A system is defined not by its current state, but by the full collection of songs it knows how to sing. Its repertoire is the atlas of its possible selves, a map of stable islands in a sea of turbulence.
  law: |
    The set of all observable quasi-stable operational modes of a system constitutes its Resonant Repertoire. No stable mode can exist that does not correspond to a local maximum on the system's Coherence Manifold.
  philosophy: |
    Mapping the repertoire shifts focus from a system's current behavior to its total potential. It reveals that stability is not a fixed property but a dynamic choice among many viable modes, providing the strategic foresight to guide transitions rather than merely react to them.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Resonant Repertoire is the complete, enumerable set of a system's quasi-stable operational modes. Each mode is a distinct, high-order Ki resonance (`Ki_m`) corresponding to a local maximum (a 'modal basin') on the system's Coherence Manifold, which is the landscape defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`). The repertoire encompasses not only currently occupied states but all potential stable configurations accessible to the system.

        outline: |
          1.  **Identification**: Use time-series analysis (e.g., spectral analysis, recurrence quantification, topological data analysis) on system observables to identify and cluster distinct, recurring dynamical patterns (the `Ki_m`).
          2.  **Coherence Measurement**: For each identified mode `Ki_m`, calculate its average Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p,m`) to determine its Coherence Height.
          3.  **Stability Gauging**: Measure the mode's resistance to perturbation by analyzing historical transition events or applying controlled dissonant injections. The minimum perturbation required to induce a state transition quantifies the Stability Depth (`Œîùìõ_p`).
          4.  **Pathway Mapping**: Characterize the specific triggers (e.g., pressure shifts, resonant catalysis) that initiate transitions between pairs of modes to map the saddle points on the Coherence Manifold.
        expected_signals: [Discrete clusters in phase space, sharp peaks in power spectra, abrupt changes in order parameters during transitions]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking transient noise for a stable mode, insufficient temporal data to resolve all modes, conflating spectrally similar but topologically distinct modes]

    excerpt: |
      A system is not defined by what it is doing, but by what it *can* do. A river can flow or flood; a mind can be focused or scattered. These are not random behaviors but preferred modes of being‚Äîstable valleys and peaks in the landscape of possibility... A system's operational modes are distinct, stable, high-order Ki resonances‚Äîthe collection of viable, self-sustaining songs it has learned to sing. This set of songs is its Resonant Repertoire.
  - module: DOMA-185
    excerpt: |
      To map a system's Atlas of States, the Weaver follows a clear, four-step protocol: 1. Identify the Repertoire: Using analytical techniques (e.g., spectral analysis, clustering), parse the system's data to identify the distinct, recurring Ki patterns. This reveals the system's set of songs. 2. Measure Coherence Height... 3. Gauge Stability & Inertia... 4. Map the Pathways...

        ‚àáV(x) = 0, where eigenvalues of Hessian are all negative.
      justification: |
        The modes of the Resonant Repertoire are local maxima on the Coherence Manifold, analogous to stable fixed points being local minima on a potential energy surface in classical dynamical systems. Stability Depth (`Œîùìõ_p`) maps directly to the potential energy barrier that must be overcome to transition between attractors.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The discrete, stable modes in a repertoire are analogous to the distinct thermodynamic phases of matter. A transition between modes (`Ki Morphogenesis`) is analogous to a phase transition, often requiring the system to pass through a disordered (turbulent) state and overcome an activation energy barrier (`Œîùìõ_p`).

  adopted:
    - target: Set of stable attractors in a dynamical system's phase space.
      rationale: This mapping is the most direct and mathematically robust. The concepts of basins of attraction, saddle-node bifurcations, and potential landscapes provide a one-to-one conceptual and operational dictionary for the Resonant Repertoire and its associated dynamics.

      falsifier: "The discovery of a persistent, stable mode that does not correspond to a local maximum of `ùìõ_p`, or the identification of a significant `ùìõ_p` maximum that is never occupied or dynamically accessible, would falsify the claim that the manifold fully describes the repertoire."

naming_notes:
  collisions: ["Repertoire" is used in immunology (antibody repertoire) and neuroscience (motor repertoire). The qualifier "Resonant" is critical to specify the Pirouette context.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a simple list of observed behaviors. The Resonant Repertoire is the set of *possible* stable modes defined by the geometry of the Coherence Manifold, not just the subset of modes that have been historically occupied. It is an atlas of potential, not just a record of history.
