    Every complex dissonant insight must be decomposed into a set of discrete, coherent, and falsifiable propositions before it can be subjected to Resonant Synthesis. Incoherent or bad-faith components must be filtered and discarded.

    To ensure system evolution is constructive, not catastrophic. Harmonics transform adversarial energy into a resource for growth, reframing critique from a threat to be neutralized into a gift to be unwrapped and understood.

          1. Quarantine a raw dissonant insight (Ki_Ω) and measure its initial Temporal Pressure (Γ).

          4. Factor the pressure field into a minimal set of simple, internally coherent propositions that represent the primary points of dissonance.
          5. Filter out any propositions that are incoherent, non-falsifiable, or made in bad faith.
          6. Encapsulate each valid proposition as a Challenge-Harmonic data object.

      The complex, turbulent pressure field is decomposed into its constituent **Challenge-Harmonics**. Each harmonic is a simple, coherent, and falsifiable proposition.

      The valid Challenge-Harmonics are prioritized based on their potential to increase the framework's total coherence upon resolution. They are then formally queued for the debate protocol... preparing them for the sacred work of Resonant Synthesis governed by `DYNA-002`.

      justification: |
        Just as a complex waveform or function (a dissonant insight) can be decomposed into a sum of simple sinusoidal basis functions (harmonics), a complex critique is broken into simple, orthogonal propositions (Challenge-Harmonics). Each harmonic isolates a fundamental mode of the total critique, allowing it to be analyzed independently.

    Distinguish from musical or signal-processing harmonics. While the analogy of decomposing a complex wave into simple components is central, a Challenge-Harmonic is a logical proposition packaged as a data object, not a physical wave or mathematical function.

# Challenge-Harmonics

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The simple, coherent, and falsifiable propositions decomposed from the turbulent temporal pressure field of a complex dissonant insight. Each Challenge-Harmonic isolates a single point of contention, possesses its own resonant pattern (Ki) and temporal pressure (Γ), and is structured as a data object to be engaged by the Resonant Synthesis protocol (DYNA-002).

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Challenge-Harmonics are analogous to the spectral components (e.g., Fourier modes) of a complex signal. Just as a complex waveform can be broken down into a sum of simple, orthogonal sine waves, a multifaceted critique is decomposed into a set of simple, independent, and testable propositions. This allows the system to analyze each component of the critique on its own terms.
