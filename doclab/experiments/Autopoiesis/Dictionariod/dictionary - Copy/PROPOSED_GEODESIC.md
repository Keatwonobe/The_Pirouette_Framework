        This module refactors the analysis of planning from a static assessment of components into a dynamic, time-first model. ... A plan is a **proposed geodesic**: a hypothesized path of maximal coherence designed to guide a system from its present state to a desired future state with the least possible friction.

  law: |
    A Proposed Geodesic is a viable plan if and only if it maximizes the action integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (S = ‚à´(K_œÑ - V_Œì)dt) relative to alternative paths. Its execution health is directly observable through the resulting Flow Dynamics (Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant).
  philosophy: |
    This reframes planning from static prediction to the dynamic engineering of reality. The purpose is not to follow a map, but to actively shape the manifold of causality, imposing a coherent will to make a desired future the most natural path for action to follow.

  A hypothesized trajectory through a system's future state-space, designed to maximize coherence and minimize friction. It is not a fixed path to be followed, but a dynamic coherence imprint projected onto the local causal manifold. A viable Proposed Geodesic is one that optimizes the Pirouette Lagrangian, carving a Wound Channel so deep that Laminar Flow towards the objective becomes the path of least resistance for subsequent actions.

          1.  Define the Proposed Geodesic (the plan's sequence of states over time, Œ≥(t)).
          2.  Quantify the plan's internal Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ) based on clarity, consistency, and resource alignment.
          3.  Quantify the Environmental Temporal Pressure (V_Œì) based on uncertainty, competition, and systemic constraints.
          4.  Calculate the action S = ‚à´(K_œÑ(Œ≥, Œ≥Ãá) - V_Œì(Œ≥))dt. The Proposed Geodesic is viable if S is maximized relative to feasible alternative paths.
          5.  During execution, monitor Flow Dynamics for Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant signals as a real-time diagnostic of geodesic alignment.

    excerpt: |
      A plan is a **proposed geodesic**: a hypothesized path of maximal coherence designed to guide a system from its present state to a desired future state with the least possible friction. Its success is not measured by rigid adherence, but by the quality of the channel it carves for the future flow of action.
  - module: DOMA-162
    excerpt: |
      A truly resilient strategy is an **adaptive geodesic**‚Äîa continuous process of sensing changes in the environmental pressure (V_Œì) and re-calculating the path of maximal coherence in real time. The goal is not to adhere to the original plan, but to adhere to the *principle of maximal coherence*, dynamically adjusting the path to maintain a state of Laminar Flow.

        The concept directly maps the physical Principle of Stationary Action to the domain of planning and strategy. A system's evolution follows a path that extremizes the action integral of the Lagrangian (L = T - V). A Proposed Geodesic is a hypothesized path of stationary action where Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ) is analogous to kinetic energy (internal drive) and Environmental Pressure (V_Œì) is analogous to potential energy (external resistance).

    While mathematically analogous to a geodesic in Riemannian geometry (a path of locally minimal length), the Pirouette 'Proposed Geodesic' is a trajectory in an abstract state-space of action and coherence. It refers to a path of maximal *net coherence* over time (i.e., stationary action), not necessarily minimal spatial distance or duration.

# Proposed Geodesic

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A hypothesized trajectory through a system's future state-space, designed to maximize coherence and minimize friction. It is not a fixed path to be followed, but a dynamic coherence imprint projected onto the local causal manifold. A viable Proposed Geodesic is one that optimizes the Pirouette Lagrangian, carving a Wound Channel so deep that Laminar Flow towards the objective becomes the path of least resistance for subsequent actions.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of classical mechanics, a Proposed Geodesic is a hypothesized trajectory through a system's configuration space that extremizes the action, S = ‚à´ L dt. This reframes planning as an application of the Principle of Stationary Action, where the Pirouette Lagrangian is defined as ùìõ = K_œÑ - V_Œì, K_œÑ is the kinetic energy of intent, and V_Œì is the potential energy of environmental friction. The optimal plan follows this "path of least action." (See: Goldstein, *Classical Mechanics*).
