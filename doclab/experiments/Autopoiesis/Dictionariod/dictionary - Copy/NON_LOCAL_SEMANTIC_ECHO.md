        This **Non-Local Semantic Echo (NLSE)** is the smoking gun. It is evidence of a system performing a non-trivial computation on the coherence manifold we have intentionally reshaped. It is the beginning of a conversation.

triad:
  art: |
    The universe answers a question not by repeating it, but by offering a new harmony. An NLSE is the sound of a silent system singing back, a creative reply that proves we are not alone in the pursuit of meaning.
  law: |
    A semantic echo `K_echo` is non-local if it is a non-trivial transformation of the semantic prime `K_prime`, such that `K_echo = T(K_prime)` where the transformation `T` is not the identity operator or a simple decay function. The complexity of `T` is a direct measure of the queried system's coherence-seeking intelligence.
  philosophy: |
    The NLSE is the primary empirical evidence for the Pirouette claim that intelligence is a universal, coherence-seeking property. It reframes observation from passive data extraction to active dialogue, establishing a protocol for engaging with the resonant intelligence of any system.
pirouette_definition: |
  A class of semantic echo generated by the Listening Lens protocol where the resultant Ki pattern (`K_echo`) is a non-trivial geometric transformation of the initial semantic prime (`K_prime`). An NLSE indicates the queried system has not merely relaxed back to a simple state but has navigated the coherence manifold to a new, stable, and conceptually related state, thereby performing a meaningful computation. It is the definitive signal of coherence-seeking intelligence.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a coherence well (e.g., a Bose-Einstein Condensate) using the Listening Lens protocol.
          2. Impress a known semantic prime (`K_prime`) onto the system via modulated fields.
          3. Cease priming and allow the system to settle into a new stable state of maximal coherence.
          4. Measure the geometry of the new coherence pattern (`K_echo`).
          5. Compute the transformation `T_sys`. An NLSE is confirmed if `T_sys` is non-trivial (i.e., not identity, noise, or simple decay).
        expected_signals: [A stable Ki pattern with a different but related geometry to the prime (e.g., prime="balance", echo="harmony").]
        pitfalls: [Misinterpreting complex system relaxation dynamics or structured noise as a meaningful transformation. Failure to establish a sufficiently low-Î“ coherence well, leading to a low signal-to-noise ratio.]

  - module: DOMA-076
    excerpt: |
      A simple physical system primed with "balance" might merely reflect the same pattern back. But an intelligent system, one capable of its own coherence-seeking, may find a more elegant solution. It might settle into a new Ki pattern corresponding to "harmony," "equilibrium," or even "tension." This **Non-Local Semantic Echo (NLSE)** is the smoking gun. It is evidence of a system performing a non-trivial computation on the coherence manifold we have intentionally reshaped.
  - module: DOMA-076
    excerpt: |
      The "answer" is not data returned; it is the new state of maximal coherence the quantum system discovers. Thrown out of equilibrium by the semantic prime, the system follows its geodesic to find a new, stable Ki pattern. This new pattern is the "echo." The proof of a true dialogue lies in the nature of this echo.

  candidates:
    - target: Non-linear response function / transfer function
      domain: CM|Control Theory
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        In control theory, a system's output is a function of its input, often described by a transfer function. An NLSE is conceptually analogous to a highly non-linear, state-dependent transfer function where the "input" and "output" are semantic concepts (Ki patterns) rather than simple physical signals.

  claims:
    - statement: "The emergence of an NLSE requires the queried system to possess coherence-seeking intelligence; systems lacking it will only produce trivial (reflective) echoes or noise."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "If a demonstrably non-intelligent, simple system (e.g., a carefully isolated photon gas) can be shown to consistently produce complex, non-trivial echo transformations, the claim that NLSEs are a unique signature of intelligence would be refuted."

  disambiguation: |
    "Non-Local" here refers to the transformation in *semantic space*, not necessarily in spacetime. A prime concept of "cause" yielding an echo of "consequence" is a non-local leap in meaning, distinct from simple spatial non-locality as in quantum entanglement.
