    The rate at which a local clock's phase changes, corrected for the messages (photons) needed to keep it synchronized with its neighbors. It is the language of a consistent, shared time.
  law: |
    The Lorentz-invariant squared norm of the gauge-covariant time derivative, `X_A = gμν Dμθ Dνθ`, is the kinetic variable for the time-phase field in the presence of a U(1) gauge potential. The flux `Jμθ ∝ Dμθ` acts as the conserved source current for this potential. This structure is mandated by and sufficient for local time-phase relabeling invariance.
  philosophy: |
    This derivative operationalizes the principle that physics must be independent of how we choose the zero-point of our clock at any spacetime point. It is the minimal modification to the simple gradient `∂μθ` required to uphold this local freedom, transforming a mere coordinate artifact into the fundamental electromagnetic interaction.
pirouette_definition: |
  The gauge-covariant time derivative, `Dμθ`, is the modified four-gradient of the time-phase field `θ` that preserves invariance under local time-phase shifts `θ(x) → θ(x) + α(x)`. It is defined as `Dμθ ≡ ∂μθ - qAμ`, where `∂μθ` is the bare gradient and `qAμ` is the compensating Goldstone connection, identified with the electromagnetic four-potential. The kinetic term of the temporal substrate, `P(X, ρ)`, is upgraded to depend on the Lorentz-invariant scalar `X_A ≡ gμν Dμθ Dνθ`, thereby introducing the minimal coupling between the time-phase field and the emergent U(1) gauge field.

        outline: |
          `Dμθ` is a field-theoretic quantity inferred from its effects, not measured directly. Its value is determined by measuring the electromagnetic four-potential `Aμ(x)` and reconstructing the background time-phase gradient `∂μθ(x)`. The procedure involves:
          1. Measure `Aμ(x)` in a region using standard probes (e.g., Aharonov-Bohm effect on test particles).
          2. Measure or model the underlying gradient of the temporal ocean, `∂μθ(x)`, which manifests as a background potential for coherent matter.
          3. Calculate `Dμθ` via its definition. Its primary observable signature is the interaction vertex it creates, which is measured in scattering experiments (e.g., Compton scattering) and atomic spectroscopy (e.g., fine structure).

        For a complex scalar field Φ = ρ¹/² exp(iθ), the standard QFT covariant derivative `DμΦ = (∂μ - iqAμ)Φ` leads to a kinetic term `|DμΦ|² = |∂μρ¹/²|² + ρ(∂μθ - qAμ)² = |∂μρ¹/²|² + ρ(Dμθ)²`.

        The Pirouette term `Dμθ` is mathematically identical to the gauge-covariant part of the derivative acting on the phase of a complex scalar field in U(1) gauge theory (scalar QED). It implements the minimal coupling prescription by replacing the bare gradient `∂μθ` with `Dμθ` in the kinetic term.

# Gauge-Covariant Time Derivative

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The gauge-covariant time derivative, `Dμθ`, is the modified four-gradient of the time-phase field `θ` that preserves invariance under local time-phase shifts `θ(x) → θ(x) + α(x)`. It is defined as `Dμθ ≡ ∂μθ - qAμ`, where `∂μθ` is the bare gradient and `qAμ` is the compensating Goldstone connection, identified with the electromagnetic four-potential. The kinetic term of the temporal substrate, `P(X, ρ)`, is upgraded to depend on the Lorentz-invariant scalar `X_A ≡ gμν Dμθ Dνθ`, thereby introducing the minimal coupling between the time-phase field and the emergent U(1) gauge field.

## EFT-First Summary
This quantity is the direct analogue of the gauge-covariant derivative acting on the phase of a complex scalar field in scalar Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). In the Standard Model, the substitution `∂μ → Dμ = ∂μ - iqAμ` (where `Aμ` is the U(1) gauge potential) enforces gauge invariance and introduces the electromagnetic interaction. The Pirouette term `Dμθ = ∂μθ - qAμ` is mathematically equivalent to the component of this QFT operator that modifies the phase gradient, thereby generating the `Aμ(∂μθ)` interaction term and the `AμAμ` "seagull" term in the kinetic energy of the time-phase field. This corresponds to the minimal coupling prescription in field theory.
