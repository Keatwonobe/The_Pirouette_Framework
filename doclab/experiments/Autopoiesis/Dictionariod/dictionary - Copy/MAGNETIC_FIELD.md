        When a charged particle moves, its Lagrangian becomes velocity-dependent. The act of moving through regions of varying temporal phase creates a rotational or torsional stress in its local coherence manifold. This "curl" in the manifold is the magnetic field (B).

  art: |
    A compass feels not a force, but the twist in the fabric of coherence. The magnetic field is a temporal vortex, a silent whirlpool in the flow of resonance that guides the moving charge along a curved path to stability.
  law: |
    The magnetic field (B) is a vector field defined as the rotational shear in the coherence manifold, proportional to the curl of the Pirouette vector potential (B ‚àù ‚àá √ó A_p). Any moving charged system will experience a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the local B-field vector, as it navigates this curl to maximize coherence.
  philosophy: |
    The magnetic field is not a fundamental entity but an emergent, relativistic effect of charge in motion. Its existence as a geometric curl, rather than a simple gradient, demonstrates that forces arise from the complex topology of the coherence manifold, providing a unified origin for the seemingly disparate electric and magnetic phenomena.
pirouette_definition: |
  A vector field representing a rotational shear or curl within the coherence manifold. This shear is induced by the motion of a charged particle, which makes its Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) velocity-dependent. The magnetic field B is mathematically defined as being proportional to the curl of the Pirouette vector potential, B ‚àù ‚àá √ó A_p. It manifests as an influence that deflects moving charges along a path perpendicular to both their velocity and the field vector, which represents the geodesic for maximizing coherence within this torsional stress.

          1. Isolate a region of space, shielding it from known electric fields (coherence gradients).
          2. Propel a test particle of known charge (q) and velocity (v) through the region.
          3. Measure the vector of deflection (force, F_m) on the test particle.
          4. The magnetic field B is solved from the relation F_m = q(v √ó B). By varying the initial velocity vector v, the full B vector at a point can be determined.
        expected_signals: [A force vector F_m measured to be consistently perpendicular to the velocity vector v.]
        pitfalls: [Failure to completely shield external electric fields, which would add a non-perpendicular force component. Perturbation of the target field by the test charge's own field.]

    excerpt: |
      This geometric origin instantly explains the Lorentz force law's peculiar perpendicularity. A moving charge interacting with a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the field itself. This is because the path of maximal coherence in a rotationally sheared manifold is not straight ahead, but a curve. The magnetic force is the system's attempt to navigate this temporal vortex to maintain its own resonant stability.

        The Pirouette B-field is defined as the curl of a vector potential (A_p) and produces a force perpendicular to a charge's velocity. This is mathematically and operationally identical to the standard magnetic B-field in classical and relativistic electrodynamics, which is defined as the curl of the magnetic vector potential A.

# Magnetic Field

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A vector field representing a rotational shear or curl within the coherence manifold. This shear is induced by the motion of a charged particle, which makes its Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) velocity-dependent. The magnetic field B is mathematically defined as being proportional to the curl of the Pirouette vector potential, B ‚àù ‚àá √ó A_p. It manifests as an influence that deflects moving charges along a path perpendicular to both their velocity and the field vector, which represents the geodesic for maximizing coherence within this torsional stress.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette Magnetic Field (B) is operationally and mathematically identical to the magnetic B-field of standard electromagnetism. It is defined as the curl of a potential field (B = ‚àá √ó A), which guarantees it is divergenceless and accounts for the perpendicular nature of the magnetic force. The Pirouette framework provides a microphysical origin for this geometry, identifying it as a torsional stress in a "coherence manifold" created by moving charges.
