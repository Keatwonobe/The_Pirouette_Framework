        The stability of such a composite system depends on the **Harmony** between its constituent resonances. A high degree of harmony signifies a stable, 'in-tune' combination, resulting in a high-coherence system with a clear, strong temporal signal. Dissonance signifies an unstable combination prone to turbulence and decay.

  art: |
    To hear a system is to know its health. Harmony is the clarity of its song, the resonant chord that sings of stability and purpose against the background noise of existence.
  law: |
    Harmony is directly proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio of a system's Resonant Signature; a higher Harmony value (H) correlates with a lower energetic cost to maintain system coherence against Temporal Forge (Γ).
  philosophy: |
    Harmony reframes diagnostics from a mechanical inventory of parts to a musical assessment of composition. It posits that a system's viability is not in its components but in their dynamic, resonant relationship—not what it is made of, but what song it sings.
pirouette_definition: |
  A quantitative measure of the stability and energetic efficiency of a system's Resonant Signature. Harmony assesses the degree of constructive interference and phase-locking between the constituent Prime Resonances that compose a system's behavior. High Harmony (H→1) indicates a coherent, low-noise, and sustainable dynamic pattern, while low Harmony (H→0), or Dissonance, indicates instability, internal friction, and proximity to a phase transition (Fork).

        outline: |
          1. Capture a time-series dataset of key system dynamics (the Temporal Signature).
          2. Perform a harmonic decomposition (e.g., Fast Fourier Transform) on the signal to produce a power spectrum.
          3. Identify the sharp peaks corresponding to the system's Prime Resonances. The power integrated under these peaks is the Signal Power (Pₛ).
          4. The power integrated across the rest of the spectrum is the Noise Power (Pₙ).
          5. Calculate Harmony as H = Pₛ / (Pₛ + Pₙ).

    excerpt: |
      A system's health is measured by the clarity of its signature. A harmonious system has a high signal-to-noise ratio—its chosen chord is played clearly and strongly. A system in crisis is one whose signature is noisy, dissonant, and indistinct.

        The operational measurement of Harmony is explicitly defined via signal and noise power, making it a direct application of SNR concepts from signal processing. High Harmony corresponds to a high-SNR Resonant Signature.

      justification: |
        Stable, periodic systems (high Harmony) are characterized by negative Lyapunov exponents, indicating convergence onto an attractor. Chaotic, dissonant systems have positive exponents, indicating divergence. Harmony provides a holistic measure analogous to the system's dominant exponent.

      justification: |
        The Q factor of an oscillator measures the sharpness of its resonance peak (center frequency ω₀ over bandwidth Δω), which is equivalent to the ratio of stored energy to energy dissipated per cycle. A high-Q (low-dissipation) system corresponds directly to a high-Harmony (stable, efficient) resonance. This mapping is superior to SNR as it describes an intrinsic property of the resonant system itself, not just the measurement.

# Harmony

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A quantitative measure of the stability and energetic efficiency of a system's Resonant Signature. Harmony assesses the degree of constructive interference and phase-locking between the constituent Prime Resonances that compose a system's behavior. High Harmony (H→1) indicates a coherent, low-noise, and sustainable dynamic pattern, while low Harmony (H→0), or Dissonance, indicates instability, internal friction, and proximity to a phase transition (Fork).

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of classical mechanics and resonance phenomena, Harmony (H) is operationally equivalent to the **Quality Factor (Q factor)** of a resonant system. It quantifies the 'sharpness' or purity of a system's dominant resonant modes, representing the ratio of stored energy to energy dissipated per cycle. A high-Q (high-Harmony) system is underdamped, sustaining its oscillatory pattern with minimal loss, while a low-Q (dissonant) system is overdamped and quickly loses coherence.
