  art: |
    A silent, rhythmic pattern on the substrate whose breath and shimmer become the particles we see. Its phase is the invisible thread guiding forces, its amplitude the very presence of being. The universe is the song played upon this single, vibrant string.
  law: |
    The dynamics of all manifest phenomena arise from extremizing the substrate action, S_time, which balances the local coherence tendency of Ki against the pressure of temporal density (Γ). All particle and field content is derived from fluctuations around the resulting Ki configuration.
  philosophy: |
    Ki serves as the framework's primary dynamical object, unifying matter and gauge fields as fluctuations of a single, pre-spatial entity. It grounds physics in phase coherence and rhythmic patterns, replacing the classical concept of point-like objects with structured field expressions.
pirouette_definition: |
  A complex-valued field defined on the pre-spatial substrate, possessing a local phase and modulus. Its fluctuations, when spatialized via a Σ-gauge, correspond to Standard Model matter fields. The gradient of its phase (`arg(Ki)`) sources the effective gauge field `A_μ`, and its local expression `J(Ki)` couples to the temporal pressure `Γ` to produce confinement and interaction.

        outline: |
          Ki is not directly observable. Its properties are inferred by measuring the spectrum of its fluctuations, which manifest as elementary particles in the SM-CG limit. A complete particle census, including all masses and couplings, constrains the effective potential `V_eff(|Ki|)`.

          Construct an optical, acoustic, or mechanical system (e.g., a waveguide array) whose dynamics mimic the phase topology of Ki. Drive the system through a closed loop in its parameter space and measure the accumulated phase (holonomy) of a test excitation.

        pitfalls: [Analogue system may not perfectly capture the `W_int(Ki, Γ)` interaction term, leading to deviations; environmental decoherence in the analogue system obscuring the signal.]
context_windows:
  - module: DYNA-004
    excerpt: |
      Ki(·) is the coherence motif field on the substrate, possessing both phase and modulus. The minimal substrate action, S_time, is an integral over a Lagrangian balancing a kinetic/coherence term `K_τ(Ki, T_a)` against potential and interaction terms. The interaction `W_int = λ · J(Ki) · Γ` couples the local expression of Ki to the temporal pressure, producing confinement.
  - module: DYNA-004
    excerpt: |
      To recover familiar physics, we pick a spatialization gauge Σ. This pushes the substrate action S_time forward into an effective spacetime action S_eff. In this limit, Ki becomes a complex section, its fluctuations around a high-coherence background yield kinetic terms like `|D_μ Ki|^2`, and the gauge covariant derivative `D_μ` is sourced by the phase of Ki itself via `A_μ = ∂_μ arg(Ki)`.

        In the SM-CG limit, fluctuations of Ki around its vacuum expectation value are described by the Lagrangian of a complex scalar field. The Ki phase's spacetime gradient `∂_μ arg(Ki)` becomes the U(1) gauge field `A_μ`, making the mapping analogous to the scalar sector of the Standard Model before electroweak symmetry breaking.

# Coherence Motif Field

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A complex-valued field defined on the pre-spatial substrate, possessing a local phase and modulus. Its fluctuations, when spatialized via a Σ-gauge, correspond to Standard Model matter fields. The gradient of its phase (`arg(Ki)`) sources the effective gauge field `A_μ`, and its local expression `J(Ki)` couples to the temporal pressure `Γ` to produce confinement and interaction.

## EFT-First Summary
In the low-energy, spatialized limit, the Coherence Motif Field (Ki) behaves as a fundamental complex scalar field. Its dynamics, described by `S_eff ≈ ∫ d⁴x [ |D_μ Ki|² − V(|Ki|) + … ]`, give rise to the matter content of the Standard Model. The phase of Ki sources a U(1) gauge potential, `A_μ = ∂_μ arg(Ki)`, making its structure analogous to the Higgs field in its role of generating mass and mediating interactions.
