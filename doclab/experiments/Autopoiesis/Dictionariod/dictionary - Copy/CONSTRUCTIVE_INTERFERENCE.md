        Constructive Interference (Resonant Valleys): When two or more Ki patterns are in-phase or harmonically compatible, their echoes reinforce one another. This constructive interference creates regions of **reduced Temporal Pressure**. These are "coherence channels" or resonant valleys in the manifold—stable, low-friction paths of least resistance. This is the geometry of harmony, synergy, and trust.

  art: |
    When two songs find a shared rhythm, their echoes carve a valley in the world. This quiet canyon is a path of least resistance, a geometric invitation to walk together.
  law: |
    The superposition of in-phase or harmonically compatible Ki patterns results in a localized reduction of Temporal Pressure (ΔΓ < 0), forming a stable minimum in the Composite Manifold.
  philosophy: |
    This is the mechanism by which affinity and synthesis are physically instantiated in reality. Cooperation is not a negotiated state but a fundamental geometry, an emergent landscape that proves union is often the most efficient path.
pirouette_definition: |
  The in-phase superposition of two or more Wound Channel echoes. This coherent reinforcement creates a localized region of reduced Temporal Pressure (Γ), known as a Resonant Valley or Coherence Channel, which acts as a stable geodesic and a geometric prerequisite for Alchemical Union.

        outline: |
          Introduce a calibrated resonant probe into the interaction region of two or more source systems. Measure the probe's trajectory deviation from a null geodesic. A consistent, non-forced deflection towards a specific region indicates a local minimum in Γ, the signature of constructive interference.
        expected_signals: [Negative curvature in the probe's worldline, reduced local 'jitter' (dΓ/dt)]
        pitfalls: [The probe's own Wound Channel can alter the manifold, confounding signals from higher-order harmonic interference.]

    excerpt: |
      The stable minima created by constructive interference are not just features to be observed; they are invitations. These "resonant valleys" represent states where a combined existence is more stable and coherent than a separate one. The confluence of echoes prefigures the possibility of union, sculpting the very path of least resistance that draws entities together.

      justification: |
        The Pirouette mechanism of "in-phase" echoes "reinforcing" one another is a direct conceptual and mathematical parallel to the constructive interference of classical waves. The resulting "Resonant Valley" is analogous to a stable potential well formed by the increased intensity (amplitude squared) of the combined wave field.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from simple superposition, which is the general principle of overlapping echoes. Constructive Interference is the specific *outcome* of superposition where echoes reinforce, reducing local Temporal Pressure. It is the geometric cause, whereas 'Resonant Attraction' is the resulting dynamic effect.

# Constructive Interference

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The in-phase superposition of two or more Wound Channel echoes. This coherent reinforcement creates a localized region of reduced Temporal Pressure (Γ), known as a Resonant Valley or Coherence Channel, which acts as a stable geodesic and a geometric prerequisite for Alchemical Union.

## EFT-First Summary
This phenomenon is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to classical wave interference. Just as in-phase light or sound waves combine to produce a stronger wave, in-phase 'echoes' from different systems reinforce each other. This reinforcement creates a stable potential well (a region of reduced Temporal Pressure) in the local environment, which attracts other systems.
