    The universe, seeking to balance its budget of coherence, writes its accounts in the curved ledger of spacetime. The Einstein-Hilbert action is the law of this grand, geometric accounting.
  law: |
    The variation of the geometric action `S_geom` with respect to the metric tensor `gμν` yields the Einstein tensor `Gμν`, which describes the curvature of spacetime. Mathematically, `δS_geom / δgμν ∝ Gμν`.
  philosophy: |
    General Relativity is not a fundamental postulate but an emergent, macroscopic description of the Pirouette Framework's core dynamics. `S_geom` represents the effective degrees of freedom of the spacetime manifold that arise to enforce the conservation of coherence at large scales.
pirouette_definition: |
  A functional of the spacetime metric `gμν` that constitutes the leading-order geometric term in the macroscopic effective action. It is generated by integrating out microscopic fluctuations of the Coherence (C) and Temporal Pressure (Γ) fields. Its structure is fixed by diffeomorphism invariance in four dimensions, and its variation with respect to the metric dictates how spacetime geometry responds to the averaged stress-energy of the C and Γ fields.

        outline: |
          The action itself is not directly measured. Its validity and the values of its parameters (`G`, `Λ`) are determined by testing the predictions of the field equations derived from it. This involves:
          1. Observing the orbital dynamics of celestial bodies (e.g., planetary precession, binary pulsars).
          2. Measuring the deflection of light by massive objects (gravitational lensing).
          3. Analyzing the expansion history of the universe using standard candles (Type Ia supernovae) and standard rulers (CMB, BAO).
          4. Detecting gravitational waves from compact object mergers.

        pitfalls: [Assuming `S_geom` is the full story (ignoring higher-curvature corrections in strong-field regimes), misinterpreting modified gravity signatures as dark matter/energy.]

        The Pirouette framework derives this exact functional form as the leading-order geometric term in the effective action after coarse-graining the fundamental `C` and `Γ` fields. Whereas General Relativity postulates this action, Pirouette presents it as an emergent consequence of coherence dynamics. The mapping is exact in the macroscopic limit.

# Einstein-Hilbert Action

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Einstein-Hilbert Action is a functional of the spacetime metric `gμν` that constitutes the leading-order geometric term in the macroscopic effective action. It is generated by integrating out microscopic fluctuations of the Coherence (C) and Temporal Pressure (Γ) fields. Its structure is fixed by diffeomorphism invariance in four dimensions, and its variation with respect to the metric dictates how spacetime geometry responds to the averaged stress-energy of the C and Γ fields.

## EFT-First Summary
In the effective field theory (EFT) limit, `S_geom` is identical to the standard Einstein-Hilbert action of General Relativity (`S_EH`). It describes the dynamics of the metric tensor as a massless spin-2 field (the graviton). Within Pirouette, this action is not fundamental but emerges from integrating out the underlying scalar fields C and Γ, with its coupling `1/16πG` determined by matching to the Newtonian limit. The action provides the basis for deriving Einstein's Field Equations, which govern all macroscopic gravitational phenomena.
