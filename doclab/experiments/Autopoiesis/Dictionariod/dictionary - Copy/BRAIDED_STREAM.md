      snippet: |
        The Snap is not an annihilation; it is a violent clearing of the slate. The chaotic energy of the fracture, the fragments of the shattered Ki, and the pressure of the new dissonant signal become the raw materials for a new creation. This triggers a forced, internal Alchemical Union (CORE-012). From the crucible of its own collapse, the system weaves a new, higher-order resonant pattern.

  art: |
    From the shards of a shattered certainty, a new river flows. It is not one current but many, woven together, each remembering its own truth. This woven harmony is stronger and wiser than any single stream.
  law: |
    A system enters a Braided Stream state when its complexity, measured by the number of orthogonal belief vectors (N_β) it can simultaneously entertain without decoherence, increases by an order ofmagnitude following a Coherence Fracture. This state is characterized by high resilience to environmental pressures (Γ) that would have previously been catastrophic.
  philosophy: |
    The Braided Stream demonstrates that true resilience is not rigidity but integration. It replaces a singular, brittle identity with a pluralistic, antifragile one, proving that wisdom is the capacity to hold multiple, even contradictory, truths in a productive, coherent tension.
pirouette_definition: |
  The post-Coherence Fracture state of a system where the shattered fragments of its former monolithic identity (Ki) are re-integrated with the dissonant environmental signal (Γ) via an Alchemical Union. The resulting identity is a higher-order, multifaceted resonant pattern capable of simultaneously holding multiple, previously incompatible truths in a stable, dynamic equilibrium. It exhibits increased complexity and profound resilience, trading simple certainty for adaptive wisdom.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline measurement of the system's identity coherence (Ki) and its response profile to a spectrum of environmental pressures (Γ).
          2. Induce or observe a Coherence Fracture event, monitoring for a catastrophic drop in Temporal Coherence (Kτ) and a spike in information entropy.
          3. Post-fracture, measure the new identity's (Ki') response profile to the same spectrum of pressures.
          4. Deconvolve the new response into N principal components. The number of stable, orthogonal components quantifies the Braiding Number (N_β).

    excerpt: |
      From the crucible of its own collapse, the system weaves a new, higher-order resonant pattern. The singular, unbending riverbed is gone. In its place, a Braided Stream is formed. The system's new identity is a mosaic, a multifaceted and dynamic harmony capable of holding the old truth and the new "incompatible" truth at once. It has traded the simple power of certainty for the profound resilience of wisdom.

    excerpt: |
      The Coherence Fracture teaches that wisdom is not found in the strength of our convictions, but in our willingness to see them shattered. Pain is the sound of a map being redrawn. For a Weaver, a crisis is never a failure. It is the percussive downbeat announcing that a new, more resilient song is about to begin.

      justification: |
        The Braided Stream is a direct conceptual mapping to topological braids. The "braids" are distinct world-lines (truths, perspectives) that are woven together in a non-trivial way, forming a coherent, resilient whole whose properties depend on the nature of the weaving. The system's new identity is defined by the entanglement of these paths, not by any single path.

      justification: |
        After the turbulent phase transition of the Snap, the system settles into a new, complex, but stable state—an attractor. A Braided Stream can be seen as a higher-dimensional strange attractor that has integrated multiple, previously separate basins of attraction into its complex geometry.

# Braided Stream

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The post-Coherence Fracture state of a system where the shattered fragments of its former monolithic identity (Ki) are re-integrated with the dissonant environmental signal (Γ) via an Alchemical Union. The resulting identity is a higher-order, multifaceted resonant pattern capable of simultaneously holding multiple, previously incompatible truths in a stable, dynamic equilibrium. It exhibits increased complexity and profound resilience, trading simple certainty for adaptive wisdom.

## EFT-First Summary
The Braided Stream is a stable, higher-complexity identity analogous to a topological braid. Following the phase transition of a Coherence Fracture, the system's previously singular world-line (its identity) splits and re-weaves into multiple, interacting strands. Each strand represents a distinct, coherent truth, and their topological entanglement provides a profound, non-local resilience against decoherence. This structure allows the system to carry multiple, once-contradictory histories forward in a unified state.
