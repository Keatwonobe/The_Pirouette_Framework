        Yield is the economic crisis point of this equation. It is the moment when the cost (`V_Γ`) required to maintain the current form (`Ki`) exceeds the system's available budget (`Kτ`).

    To place a system under strain is to ask it a question, not "How strong are you?" but "Who are you?" Its response—bending, yielding, or breaking—is the most honest answer it can give.
  law: |
    A system is forced into a state transition when the environmental Coherence Cost (`V_Γ`) exceeds its internal Coherence Budget (`Kτ`). The continuation of the prior state is no longer the path of maximal coherence.
  philosophy: |
    The Breaking Point reframes system failure not as a material property but as a universal dynamic of choice under pressure. It reveals a system's fundamental strategies for existence—adapt, transform, or dissolve—when its identity is tested by its environment.
pirouette_definition: |
  The critical moment in a system's dynamics when the environmental Coherence Cost (`V_Γ`) exceeds the system's internal Coherence Budget (`Kτ`). At this point, maintaining the current resonant identity (`Ki`) is no longer the path of maximal coherence, forcing a state transition into a new flow regime: elastic yield (adaptive flow), plastic yield (transformative flow), or fracture (coherence collapse).

        outline: |
          Systematically increase external stress (Temporal Pressure, `Γ`) on a system while monitoring its state variables and resonant patterns (`Ki`). The Breaking Point is identified as the critical `Γ` value at which a non-linear state transition is observed. This transition manifests as a divergence from linear response, a permanent deformation, or a catastrophic failure signal.
        expected_signals: [Hysteresis in stress-strain curve, acoustic emission (fracture), permanent change in state variable after stress removal (plasticity), sudden change in resonant frequency]
        pitfalls: [Failing to increase stress quasi-statically, masking the plastic deformation regime; Mistaking measurement noise for micro-transitions]

    excerpt: |
      Yield is the economic crisis point of this equation. It is the moment when the cost (`V_Γ`) required to maintain the current form (`Ki`) exceeds the system's available budget (`Kτ`). At this point, continuing in the same state is no longer the path of maximal coherence. The system is forced into a phase transition.

    excerpt: |
      A Weaver's task is not to measure the exact point of failure, but to understand a system's strategy for dealing with strain and its proximity to the breaking point. Is the system robust? Is it adaptable? Or is it brittle, so rigid in its identity that it cannot bend, and therefore is destined to break?

  evocative_lines:
    - "A scar is not a mark of damage, but the memory of a choice made under pressure."
    - "Yield is not a property; it is a universal dynamic—a story that unfolds whenever a system's form is tested by the pressure of its environment."

      justification: |
        The Pirouette Breaking Point is the conceptual analog to the yield point in classical materials science. Both mark the transition from elastic (reversible) to plastic (irreversible) deformation or fracture. The Pirouette framework re-interprets this mechanical threshold as a universal information-theoretic crisis where coherence cost exceeds budget.

      falsifier: "Discovering a system that undergoes catastrophic failure while its measured Coherence Budget (`Kτ`) is still significantly larger than the applied Coherence Cost (`V_Γ`). This would indicate a failure mechanism not governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian's economic principle."

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'Breaking Point' is a precise technical term for the dynamic event where `V_Γ > Kτ`. It is the onset of any non-elastic response and should not be confused with the ultimate tensile strength, which is a specific instance of the 'Fracture' outcome that occurs at a higher stress level than the initial yield.
