  art: |
    A landscape of resonance whose hills and valleys guide motion. Particles do not feel a push, but surf the slopes and currents of this terrain toward their own stability.
  law: |
    Forces experienced by a particle are manifestations of the local geometry of the Coherence Manifold. The electric field is proportional to the gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian (E ‚àù ‚àáùìõ_p), and the magnetic field is proportional to its curl (B ‚àù ‚àá √ó A_p). Motion follows geodesics on this manifold.
  philosophy: |
    Replaces the concept of independent, fundamental forces with a single, universal geometry. The drive to maximize coherence is the sole engine of dynamics, and the manifold is the landscape upon which this drive plays out, rendering force an emergent illusion of perspective.
pirouette_definition: |
  A conceptual manifold whose local geometry is defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p). The gradient of ùìõ_p defines a 'slope' that gives rise to electric-like forces, while the curl of the associated Pirouette vector potential (A_p) defines a 'twist' or 'shear' that gives rise to magnetic-like forces. Particles move along geodesics on this manifold, a path that maximizes their temporal coherence and is observed as motion under the influence of force.

        outline: |
          Introduce a test particle with known coherence properties (charge) into the region of interest. Measure its acceleration vector at various points and velocities. The resulting vector field directly maps the gradients (from static tests) and curls (from dynamic tests) of the Coherence Manifold.
        expected_signals: [A conservative vector field from static sources, A rotational vector field from moving sources]
        pitfalls: [The test particle must not significantly alter the manifold it is measuring. Disentangling the gradient and curl components requires careful control over the test particle's velocity.]

    excerpt: |
      CORE-006 concluded with a bold claim: that all forces are simply geodesics on a manifold of coherence. This module provides the first proof. We will now apply the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) to derive the properties of the electromagnetic force, demonstrating that it is not a fundamental "thing" in itself, but an emergent consequence of systems following the Principle of Maximal Coherence.
  - module: CORE-007_the_current_and_the_compass
    excerpt: |
      A test charge placed in this field doesn't feel a "push" or "pull." It senses a slope in the coherence manifold... When a charged particle moves... The act of moving through regions of varying temporal phase creates a rotational or torsional stress in its local coherence manifold. This "curl" in the manifold is the magnetic field (B).

      justification: |
        In General Relativity, particles follow geodesics on a spacetime manifold whose curvature is defined by the mass-energy distribution. In Pirouette, particles follow geodesics on the Coherence Manifold whose geometry is defined by the coherence-based Lagrangian. Both formalisms replace "force" with "geometry."

  claims:
    - statement: "The geometry of the Coherence Manifold, as derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian, must fully reproduce all known electromagnetic phenomena, including Maxwell's equations and relativistic effects."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "An observed electromagnetic effect (e.g., Aharonov‚ÄìBohm effect, quantum Hall effect) that cannot be derived as a geodesic path on the manifold would falsify or constrain the concept."

  disambiguation: |
    Crucially distinguish from the spacetime manifold of General Relativity. The Coherence Manifold is a configuration or state space whose geometry dictates dynamics *within* spacetime. Its gradients and curls are projected into spacetime as observable forces.
