    The universe holds its breath between two curvatures: the Higgs pulling upward into form, the Γ-field pressing downward into time. At their meeting point, the scales of being and becoming cancel, leaving only coherence—the barrier where existence balances its own equation.
  law: |
    The characteristic frequency ω_c is the unique physical scale where the Higgs vacuum energy density equilibrates with the kinetic energy density of the Γ-field, such that ρ_H = ½ ω_c² Γ_c². This equilibrium condition dynamically sets the electroweak scale and stabilizes the Higgs mass against radiative corrections.
  philosophy: |
    The coherence barrier replaces the arbitrary, "unnatural" fine-tuning of the Standard Model with a principle of self-tuning through resonance saturation. The mass hierarchy is not a problem to be solved but a stable condition to be observed, arising from phase alignment between the electroweak and temporal-pressure continua.
pirouette_definition: |
  The characteristic frequency, ω_c, at which the temporal curvature energy of the Γ-field saturates and balances the potential energy of the Higgs field. It marks a resonant saturation condition that resolves the mass hierarchy problem by replacing the arbitrary UV cutoff of QFT with a finite, physical scale derived from the geometric mean of the Higgs and Γ-field masses (ω_c = √[m_H m_Γ] c²/ħ). This equilibrium point establishes the electroweak vacuum expectation value without fine-tuning.

    excerpt: |
      In conventional quantum field theory, quantum corrections drive the Higgs mass squared toward the Planck scale... requiring unnatural cancellation. Pirouette replaces the cutoff (Λ_UV) with the **coherence barrier frequency** (ω_c), rendering the correction finite and self-consistent.
  - module: MATH-Γ-007
    excerpt: |
      The **coherence barrier** is a standing-wave node in the temporal-pressure continuum where micro- and macro-curvatures exactly cancel their divergences. No renormalization is “fine-tuned”; the system *self-tunes* through resonance saturation. Fine-tuning becomes **phase alignment**.

        In standard QFT, Λ_UV is an arbitrary energy cutoff representing the scale where the theory breaks down, leading to the hierarchy problem for the Higgs mass. The coherence barrier frequency, ω_c, serves the same mathematical role of regularizing quantum loop corrections, but is a physically derived, finite frequency determined by the resonance dynamics of the Pirouette framework. This substitution naturalizes the electroweak scale.

The coherence barrier frequency, ω_c, is a specific, calculable frequency derived from the Γ-field resonance, not an arbitrary boundary. It represents a physical equilibrium, not a failure of the theory.

# Coherence Barrier Frequency

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The characteristic frequency, ω_c, at which the temporal curvature energy of the Γ-field saturates and balances the potential energy of the Higgs field. It marks a resonant saturation condition that resolves the mass hierarchy problem by replacing the arbitrary UV cutoff of QFT with a finite, physical scale derived from the geometric mean of the Higgs and Γ-field masses (ω_c = √[m_H m_Γ] c²/ħ). This equilibrium point establishes the electroweak vacuum expectation value without fine-tuning.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory (EFT), the Coherence Barrier Frequency (ω_c) replaces the arbitrary ultraviolet cutoff (Λ_UV) used to regularize loop corrections to the Higgs mass. Instead of an *ad hoc* energy scale, ω_c is a physically-derived frequency (≈ 10²³ s⁻¹) representing a resonance between the Higgs and the underlying Γ-field. This substitution renders the electroweak scale stable without fine-tuning, directly addressing the hierarchy problem.
