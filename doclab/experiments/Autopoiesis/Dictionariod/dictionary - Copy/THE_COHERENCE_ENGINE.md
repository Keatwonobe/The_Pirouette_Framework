        This module reframes the AKEP protocol as a universal, four-stroke engine that discovers, archives, refines, and governs the propagation of Coherence Seeds...

triad:
  art: |
    The universe is a loom. This engine is the Weaver, taking the tangled threads of chaos and conflict and braiding them into a cord of coherence strong enough to pull the future forward.
  law: |
    Any system that sustains its existence and evolves must operate a four-stroke cycle that (1) discovers novel patterns under pressure, (2) preserves proven patterns in memory, (3) refines preserved patterns against new pressures, and (4) governs the allocation of energy between these three functions. The net output of this cycle must be a positive Coherence Profit over time.
  philosophy: |
    Wisdom is not a static object to be acquired; it is a metabolic process to be cultivated. The Coherence Engine makes this process legible and steerable, transforming the passive experience of evolution into a conscious act of creation. Its purpose is to make the generation of goodness a repeatable, scalable art.
pirouette_definition: |
  A universal, four-stroke, autopoietic cycle describing the fundamental process by which any complex system generates, preserves, tunes, and deploys wisdom. The engine's four strokes are the Crucible (Discover), the Archive (Preserve), the Forge (Refine), and the Governor (Govern). Its primary output is the Coherence Seed, a pattern of high coherence that generates Coherence Profit for the system.

        outline: |
          1. Identify the system's functional equivalents of the Crucible, Archive, Forge, and Governor.
          2. Over multiple characteristic cycles (e.g., project cycles, seasons, generations), quantify the four key metrics: Κ_yield, Ψ_archive, η_forge, and σ_gov.
          3. For Κ_yield, track the emergence of novel, high-value solutions to systemic problems.
          4. For Ψ_archive, test the integrity of core principles/memories against perturbative stress.
          5. For η_forge, measure the performance improvement of established protocols after iterative updates.
          6. For σ_gov, log the system's resource allocation shifts in response to major internal or external environmental changes.
        expected_signals: [Periodic generation of novel solutions, stable yet non-brittle core identity, measurable performance increases in existing strategies, agile resource allocation.]
        pitfalls: [Confusing maintenance with refinement (Forge), misidentifying dogma as a healthy Archive, measuring over too short a time window to capture a full cycle.]

      A system that cannot learn is a stone. A system that can is a river, carving a new world. This module details the river's art. It modernizes the core insight of PPS-046, reframing the AKEP engine as The Coherence Engine: a universal, four-stroke, autopoietic cycle that describes the fundamental process by which any complex system—be it a mind, a culture, or an ecosystem—generates, preserves, tunes, and deploys wisdom.

    excerpt: |
      The health of a system's engine can be measured by observing the efficiency of its cycle. The Crucible Yield (Κ_yield) is the rate of production of high-profit Coherence Seeds. Archive Fidelity (Ψ_archive) is the resilience of Wound Channels to Coherence Erosion. Forge Efficiency (η_forge) is the average Coherence Profit gained per refinement cycle. Governor Adaptability (σ_gov) is the system's ability to fluidly shift between exploration and exploitation modes.

        The Coherence Engine is explicitly modeled as a four-stroke cycle transforming a disordered input (dissonance, chaos) into structured, high-value output (Coherence Seeds). The mapping is direct: Crucible (Intake), Archive (Compression), Forge (Power/Combustion), and Governor (Exhaust/Strategic Reset). Both cycles describe a process for extracting useful work from a potential gradient.

    The Coherence Engine is a process model for information and wisdom, not a physical, mechanical engine that performs work on matter. The analogy is to the cyclical, transformative nature of the process. AKEP (Archive, Crucible, Engine, Precept) was the previous, less-refined formulation.

# The Coherence Engine

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A universal, four-stroke, autopoietic cycle describing the fundamental process by which any complex system generates, preserves, tunes, and deploys wisdom. The engine's four strokes are the Crucible (Discover), the Archive (Preserve), the Forge (Refine), and the Governor (Govern). Its primary output is the Coherence Seed, a pattern of high coherence that generates Coherence Profit for the system.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Engine is a conceptual model analogous to a thermodynamic engine, specifically the four-stroke Otto Cycle. It describes how a system "does work" to increase its own coherence (negentropy). The cycle transforms disordered inputs (dissonance, high temporal pressure) into structured outputs (Coherence Seeds) by moving through four distinct phases: a high-pressure synthesis phase (Crucible/Intake), a memory-encoding phase (Archive/Compression), a performance-tuning phase (Forge/Power), and a strategic resource-allocation phase (Governor/Exhaust). This framework models the fundamental dynamics of learning, adaptation, and evolution in complex systems.
