    The universal tide of dissonance; the constant, gentle abrasion of entropy's sandpaper that wears away all form and memory.
  law: |
    The rate of Coherence Erosion in a system is directly proportional to its susceptibility to Ambient Temporal Noise (Œì), manifested as a continuous decrease in the system's action integral (`S_p`) over time.
  philosophy: |
    Ambient Temporal Noise is the manifestation of universal entropy within the Pirouette Framework, representing the ever-present environmental pressure that makes coherence a costly, non-default state. It is the 'why' behind the need for maintenance and remembrance; without Œì, systems would be static and history would have no friction.
pirouette_definition: |
  Ambient Temporal Noise (Œì) is the constant, low-grade, dissonant environmental pressure that acts as the primary driver of Coherence Erosion. It functions as a source of microscopic errors that, when uncorrected, degrade a system's resonant pattern (Ki) and its historical memory (Wound Channel). In the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`), Œì is the potential (`V_Œì`) against which a system must work to maintain its coherence.

          3. Expose the system to the ambient environment under test.
          4. Continuously measure the decay rate of KœÑ. The rate of decay, when normalized for the system's intrinsic stability, provides an indirect measure of Œì.

      Every system is perpetually bombarded by the dissonant echoes of ambient temporal noise (Œì). This noise acts as a constant, gentle abrasion on the system's resonant pattern (Ki)...This loop‚Äîfrom noise, to Ki degradation, to a rutted Wound Channel, to greater susceptibility to noise‚Äîis the engine of drift. It is the slow, inexorable victory of entropy over information.

    excerpt: |
      Drift is the process by which a system, under the constant, abrasive pressure of ambient temporal noise (Œì), loses the precision of its resonant pattern (Ki) and the integrity of its memory (Wound Channel). It is the story of a system slowly forgetting how to be itself.

        Œì acts as a constant, random, external pressure causing dissipation and decay (erosion), analogous to how a particle in a thermal bath experiences random collisions and viscous drag. Both drive a system towards a state of maximum entropy or equilibrium (dissolution/cascade failure).

# Ambient Temporal Noise

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Ambient Temporal Noise (Œì) is the constant, low-grade, dissonant environmental pressure that acts as the primary driver of Coherence Erosion. It functions as a source of microscopic errors that, when uncorrected, degrade a system's resonant pattern (Ki) and its historical memory (Wound Channel). In the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`), Œì is the potential (`V_Œì`) against which a system must work to maintain its coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Ambient Temporal Noise (Œì) maps to a stochastic noise background or thermal bath in classical/statistical mechanics. It represents the incessant, random environmental interactions that drive a system towards entropic equilibrium, causing dissipation of its ordered energy (coherence) and decay of its form. The Pirouette term `V_Œì` acts analogously to a potential energy cost for existing in this noisy environment.
