        It details how to apply calibrated Temporal Pressure (Γ) to compel a system to evolve its resonant pattern (Ki), thereby establishing a new, more resilient baseline of coherence (Kτ).

  art: |
    A new, stronger song composed under pressure. It is the lasting resonance left after the fire of a challenge has cooled, tempering the instrument of the self into something more capable.
  law: |
    A system's Kτ is the stable, maximal level of coherence it can maintain post-forging, quantified by a sustained increase (ΔKτ > 0) in task-specific performance or resilience under a given Temporal Pressure (Γ).
  philosophy: |
    Kτ represents the physical embodiment of growth. It is the proof that a system is not a static entity but a dynamic process that integrates stress, transforming past challenges into present capacity.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Baseline of Coherence (Kτ) is the new, higher-order steady-state resonant pattern achieved by a system following a successful Coherence Forging. It represents the system's total internal capacity and resilience, acting as the kinetic term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = Kτ - VΓ). A successful forging increases Kτ by an amount greater than the applied challenge (VΓ), resulting in a permanent increase in the system's ability to perform work and maintain integrity against environmental pressure.
operational_definition:
  units: Context-dependent. Often measured via task-specific metrics like information processing rate (bits/sec), recovery time from stress (seconds), or as a dimensionless resilience factor.
  symbol_table:
    - name: Kτ
      meaning: Baseline of Coherence; a system's total internal capacity and stable resilience post-forging.
      dimensions: Contextual (e.g., [Information]/[Time] or dimensionless)
      default_range: Contextual, but must satisfy Kτ > Ki (initial coherence).
    - name: ΔKτ
      meaning: Change in Baseline of Coherence; the measured increase in capacity.
      dimensions: Same as Kτ.
      default_range: ΔKτ > 0 for a successful forging.
  measurement:
    procedures:
      - name: Baseline Shift Analysis
        outline: |
          1. Establish an initial performance baseline (Ki) on a specific, targeted capability (e.g., problem-solving speed, emotional regulation under load).
          2. Administer a calibrated Crucible protocol (DOMA-100).
          3. After the designated integration phase, re-measure performance on the same task under similar or increased pressure.
          4. Kτ is the new, stable performance level; ΔKτ is the measured difference (Kτ - Ki).
        expected_signals: [Sustained increase in task performance metrics, Reduced decoherence time under subsequent stressors, Increased complexity handling]
        pitfalls: [Conflating temporary post-trial euphoria with a stable Kτ, Insufficient integration time leading to reversion to Ki, Measurement task is not representative of the forged adaptation]

    excerpt: |
      A successful forging doesn't just return the system to its previous state; it elevates it, creating a new, higher baseline of coherence (Kτ) that becomes a permanent feature of its being. This is the art of using pressure to compose a stronger soul.
  - module: DOMA-100
    excerpt: |
      To restore and maximize 𝓛_p under this new pressure, the system cannot simply endure; it must innovate. It must discover a new, more efficient Ki that raises its internal coherence Kτ by an amount greater than the increase in VΓ. This act of forced innovation is the engine of all meaningful growth.

      justification: |
        Like evolutionary fitness, Kτ represents a system's adapted state relative to its environment (VΓ). An increase in Kτ (ΔKτ > 0) is analogous to an increase in fitness, conferring a greater capacity for survival and action within a given selective pressure.

      equation_hint: |
        𝓛_p = Kτ - VΓ ≈ -F
      rationale: |
        The Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p = Kτ - VΓ` is structurally analogous to the negative Free Energy `F = <ln p(y|θ)>_q - KL(q||p)`. Maximizing `𝓛_p` by increasing `Kτ` is analogous to maximizing model evidence by improving predictive accuracy, which is the core dynamic of the Free Energy Principle. Kτ maps to the accuracy/evidence term.

  claims:
    - statement: "A successful coherence forging always results in a new baseline Kτ that is measurably greater than the initial coherence Ki (ΔKτ > 0)."

      falsifier: "Repeated observation of systems undergoing calibrated crucibles (per DOMA-100) that consistently revert to their initial baseline Ki, or a lower one, after the integration phase."

    Distinguish from Ki (initial coherence), which is the state *before* a forging, and K_inst (instantaneous coherence), which may fluctuate wildly during a trial. Kτ is the new, stable *baseline* achieved after the trial and integration are complete.

# Baseline of Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Baseline of Coherence (Kτ) is the new, higher-order steady-state resonant pattern achieved by a system following a successful Coherence Forging. It represents the system's total internal capacity and resilience, acting as the kinetic term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = Kτ - VΓ). A successful forging increases Kτ by an amount greater than the applied challenge (VΓ), resulting in a permanent increase in the system's ability to perform work and maintain integrity against environmental pressure.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of the Free Energy Principle (FEP), the Baseline of Coherence (Kτ) is analogous to the evidence for a system's generative model of its environment. A successful forging process is equivalent to active inference, where the system updates its model (finds a new Ki) to better predict and act upon its world, thereby minimizing surprise (or Variational Free Energy, F). The establishment of a new Kτ represents a successful model update, leading to a permanent increase in predictive accuracy and a corresponding reduction in future surprise.
