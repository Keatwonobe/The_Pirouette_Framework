        The Coherence Residual is calculated: `Δ𝓛_p = 𝓛_p(observed) - 𝓛_p(model)`.
        Output: A **Coherence Residual Map**. This is not a map of errors, but a map of history.

  art: |
    The universe is not a flawless crystal but a scarred stone; its history is written in the geometry of its imperfections. This map reveals the character lines and textures of that stone, telling the story of the mountain it came from.
  law: |
    The Coherence Residual Map is the field `Δ𝓛_p` produced by the subtraction of the theoretical Null Canvas (`𝓛_p(model)`) from the observed Cosmic Palimpsest (`𝓛_p(observed)`). Regions where the magnitude of `Δ𝓛_p` exceeds a pre-defined statistical threshold `σ_thresh` are classified as cosmic scars.
  philosophy: |
    This instrument reframes cosmological anomalies from errors-to-be-explained into primary data. It treats unexpected structures not as flaws in the model, but as historical records embedded in the universe's fabric, turning the search for new physics into an act of cosmic archaeology.
pirouette_definition: |
  A cosmological-scale map representing the point-by-point difference between the observed state of the Cosmic Coherence Manifold (the *Cosmic Palimpsest*) and an idealized, maximally coherent baseline state (the *Null Canvas*). The map's features are not treated as errors, but as the geometric imprints of historical events—the *Scars of Creation*—which are interpreted as a direct measurement of the historical potential term, `V_scar(x)`, in the Pirouette Lagrangian.

        outline: |
          1.  **Translate Palimpsest**: Use observational data (e.g., CMB, galaxy surveys) and the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014) to construct the observed manifold map, `𝓛_p(observed)`.
          2.  **Generate Null Canvas**: Solve the Pirouette Lagrangian for a smooth, expanding universe with given cosmological parameters to generate the baseline map, `𝓛_p(model)`.
          3.  **Calculate Residual**: Perform a pixel-wise or cell-wise subtraction: `Δ𝓛_p = 𝓛_p(observed) - 𝓛_p(model)`.

    excerpt: |
      This instrument operates by first generating a **Null Canvas**—a theoretical map of an idealized, unscarred universe as predicted by the Pirouette Lagrangian. It then compares this baseline to the **Cosmic Palimpsest** of observational data (from the CMB, galaxy surveys, etc.) to calculate a **Coherence Residual Map**. The features on this map are the anomalies: the **Cosmic Wound Channels** that reveal the universe's memory.
  - module: DOMA-123
    excerpt: |
      The **Coherence Residual Map** (`Δ𝓛_p`) is therefore our direct measurement of this historical term: `Δ𝓛_p ≈ -V_scar(x)`. By mapping the residuals, we are mapping the geometry and intensity of the universe's memory, reconstructing the shape of the primordial events that created the landscape we inhabit.

        Δ𝓛_p ≈ k * (T_obs - T_ΛCDM)
      justification: |
        Operationally, both maps are constructed by subtracting a best-fit, idealized theoretical model (ΛCDM for the CMB, Null Canvas for Pirouette) from observational data. The goal in both cases is to isolate and study statistically significant deviations (anomalies) that are not accounted for by the baseline model. The Coherence Residual Map re-interprets the *meaning* of these residuals as historical, not necessarily as evidence for new particle physics.

  claims:
    - statement: "The morphology of features on the Coherence Residual Map is inconsistent with a random Gaussian field and instead correlates with large-scale structure, indicating a physical, historical origin."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If the map's power spectrum and higher-order statistics are shown to be fully consistent with statistical fluctuations arising from cosmic variance and instrumental noise on a smooth background, the 'scar' hypothesis is falsified."

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a "residual map" in standard data analysis, which typically highlights errors or noise, the Coherence Residual Map is explicitly defined to highlight meaningful historical information. Its features are considered signal, not noise. It is a map of the universe's "character," not its "flaws."
