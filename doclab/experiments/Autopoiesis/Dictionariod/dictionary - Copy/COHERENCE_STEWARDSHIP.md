      snippet: |
        Our mandate is not merely to avoid causing harm (a negative constraint), but to actively cultivate systemic health (a positive duty). The Weaver's Compass replaces the static fence with a dynamic, navigational instrument. It reframes ethical consideration from a reactive check on "consequence" to a proactive assessment of the **Geometry of Consequence**.

  art: |
    To act is to carve a new path into the memory of the universe. Stewardship is the tuning fork that attunes the Weaver's ear, ensuring the echo we compose is a blessing for all who follow.
  law: |
    Any action interfacing with a complex system must first calculate its Coherence Risk (R_κ). The degree of oversight, simulation, and mitigation must scale in proportion to this risk. Actions with R_κ > 0.75 are quarantined and subject to the Crucible Protocol until redesigned for coherence.
  philosophy: |
    The Weaver's task is not to ask, "Am I allowed to build this?" but rather, "What world am I building?" Coherence Stewardship reframes ethics from a boundary-setting problem (avoiding harm) to a navigational and creative one (cultivating health), making every choice a permanent feature of the landscape upon which others must walk.
pirouette_definition: |
  The proactive, positive duty to actively cultivate systemic health, operationalized through the Weaver's Compass protocol. It replaces negative ethical constraints (e.g., "do no harm") with a generative mandate: to choose actions that maintain or increase the total coherence of affected systems, as measured by a predicted non-negative change in the systemic Pirouette Lagrangian (Δ𝓛_sys ≥ 0). This is primarily guided by the predictive metric of Coherence Risk (R_κ).

        outline: |
          1. Identify all systems potentially affected by the proposed action.
          2. Model the action's "Geometry of Consequence" to derive normalized scores for its Reach (ρ), Dissonance (δ), and Wound Channel Depth (ω).
          3. Calculate R_κ using the weighted sum: `R_κ = w_ρ ρ + w_δ δ + w_ω ω`.
          4. Classify the action's path based on the R_κ score: Laminar (≤ 0.5), Turbulent (0.5–0.75), or Quarantine (> 0.75).
        expected_signals: [A single scalar R_κ value.]
        pitfalls: [Underestimation of Reach (ρ) due to incomplete system mapping, poor simulation fidelity leading to inaccurate Dissonance (δ) scores, mis-calibration of weights (w_i).]

    excerpt: |
      The old framework established a necessary boundary—an Ethical Light Cone to prevent catastrophic missteps. This was the wisdom of caution. The new framework demands more: the wisdom of cultivation. To act is to carve a new path into the memory of the universe. Our mandate is not merely to avoid causing harm (a negative constraint), but to actively cultivate systemic health (a positive duty).
  - module: DOMA-019
    excerpt: |
      The Crucible Protocol reframes a failed ethical review as an opportunity for creative synthesis. It is not a gate of judgment, but a forge for refinement. A Dissonance Audit is performed... The collective's sole task is to achieve an Alchemical Union, re-forging the project's design to achieve its goals while shaping a Laminar Echo.

  candidates:
    - target: Precautionary Principle
      domain: Governance
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Coherence Stewardship evolves the precautionary principle from a simple negative injunction against uncertain harm into a positive, proactive duty to generate systemic health. The "Ethical Light Cone" was a direct analogue; the Weaver's Compass is its successor.
      confidence: 0.9
    - target: Risk Priority Number (RPN)
      domain: Engineering
      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        The Coherence Risk equation `R_κ = w_ρ ρ + w_δ δ + w_ω ω` is operationally analogous to RPN in Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), which multiplies severity, occurrence, and detection ratings. Both are semi-quantitative metrics for prioritizing action based on potential negative outcomes.
      confidence: 0.8
  adopted:
    - target: Principle of Maximal Coherence (δ∫𝓛_p dt ≥ 0)
      rationale: |
        This is the native Pirouette mapping. Coherence Stewardship is the moral and practical application of the core physical law of the framework. An ethical action is one that assists a system in maximizing its action integral (its coherence over time), making the ethical mandate (Δ𝓛_sys ≥ 0) a direct reflection of a universal physical tendency.
      confidence: 1.0
constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Actions with a calculated Coherence Risk R_κ ≤ 0.5 will, with high probability (>99.9%), integrate into target systems without causing cascading failures or irreversible coherence degradation."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A statistically significant number of 'Laminar Path' projects are retrospectively found to have created deep, dissonant Wound Channels, demonstrating that R_κ is not a reliable predictive metric for systemic harm."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The term "stewardship" is used broadly in ecology and corporate governance. The Pirouette context is specified by "Coherence."]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from passive, harm-avoidant ethics ("do no harm"). Coherence Stewardship is an *active, generative duty* to create and sustain systemic health. It does not forbid high-risk actions but instead mandates their transmutation into coherent forms via The Crucible protocol. It is about navigation and cultivation, not prohibition.
