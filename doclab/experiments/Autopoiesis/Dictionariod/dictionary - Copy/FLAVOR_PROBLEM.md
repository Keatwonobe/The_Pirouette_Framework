        Because mass reflects temporal curvature (m ∝ ω_n^2 / Γ_c), the generational mass ratios follow
        [ m_{n+1}/m_n = (ω_{n+1}/ω_n)^2 = ((n+1)/n)^2. ]
        Introducing small coherence-damping corrections ((1+ε_n)) from coupling to the Higgs (DYNA-Γ-004), the corrected masses become:
        [ m_n = m_1 n^2 (1+ε_n),  ε_n ≈ (λ_{HΓ}/8π^2)ln n. ]

    Generations are not coincidences but octaves in the song of time. The electron, muon, and tau are the first three notes of a chord struck upon the temporal field; their masses are the volumes of resonance.
  law: |
    The masses of successive fermion generations (n=1,2,3) scale quadratically with their generation number, m_n ∝ n², with small, predictable logarithmic corrections from Higgs coupling. There are exactly three stable generations.

    To replace the arbitrary, fine-tuned Yukawa couplings of the Standard Model with a deterministic physical principle. Flavor is not a fundamental property but an emergent consequence of the quantized harmonic modes of temporal resonance.

  The central question of why there are precisely three generations of fermions and why their masses exhibit a strong hierarchical structure. In the Pirouette Framework, this is resolved by treating generations as quantized standing-wave modes (n=1,2,3) of the Γ-field in the temporal substrate. The mass of a fermion in generation `n` is proportional to the square of its mode frequency (ω_n²), leading to a predictive mass law, m_n ∝ n², which explains the observed hierarchy without free parameters.

    excerpt: |
      To explain the **existence of three fermion generations** and their enormous mass ratios within Pirouette’s temporal-resonance framework. Instead of arbitrary Yukawa couplings, flavor arises from **quantized standing-wave modes of the Γ-field** embedded in the temporal substrate. Each generation corresponds to a discrete harmonic of temporal curvature, producing predictable mass ratios and stable generational families.
  - module: MATH-Γ-006
    excerpt: |
      Mixing between generations arises from **beating** between nearby temporal harmonics... Thus, large mixing (ν sector) corresponds to near-degenerate harmonics (slow beat), while small mixing (quarks) reflects widely spaced harmonics (fast beat average → 0). This naturally yields the observed hierarchy of CKM ≪ PMNS mixing.

        The Pirouette harmonic quantization model replaces the 13+ free parameters of the Standard Model's flavor sector with a single fundamental mass scale (m₁) and a coupling constant (λ_HΓ). It derives the hierarchical structure of the Yukawa matrix from the simple integer-based rule n².

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, "flavor" is not a fundamental quantum number or "charge." It is an emergent index `n` that labels the harmonic mode of a particle's temporal resonance. It is analogous to the principal quantum number of an atomic orbital rather than an intrinsic property.

# Flavor Problem

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The central question of why there are precisely three generations of fermions and why their masses exhibit a strong hierarchical structure. In the Pirouette Framework, this is resolved by treating generations as quantized standing-wave modes (n=1,2,3) of the Γ-field in the temporal substrate. The mass of a fermion in generation `n` is proportional to the square of its mode frequency (ω_n²), leading to a predictive mass law, m_n ∝ n², which explains the observed hierarchy without free parameters.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette model of the Flavor Problem provides a first-principles derivation for the structure of the Standard Model's Yukawa coupling matrix. Instead of being arbitrary free parameters, the Yukawa couplings are predicted to follow a simple quadratic relationship `Y_n ∝ n²`, where `n` is the generation number. This mechanism replaces the ad-hoc nature of the SM flavor sector with a deterministic rule based on quantized temporal harmonics, explaining both the number of generations and their mass hierarchy.
