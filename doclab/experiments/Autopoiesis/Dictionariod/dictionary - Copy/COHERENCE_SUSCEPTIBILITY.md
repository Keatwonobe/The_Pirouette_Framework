  art: |
    A system poised at the edge of change, listening for a whisper. Susceptibility is the echo that a small perturbation awakens in the collective, determining whether the whisper fades or becomes a roar.
  law: |
    The coherence susceptibility is the ratio of the induced change in the coherence order parameter to the strength of an infinitesimal applied perturbing field. It diverges at the critical point according to a power law defined by the critical exponent γ_P.
  philosophy: |
    Susceptibility quantifies the fragility and responsiveness of a coherent state. It is the crucial link between micro-scale perturbations and macro-scale systemic change, explaining how small environmental, cognitive, or social inputs can trigger massive phase transitions.
pirouette_definition: |
  A measure of the linear response of the coherence order parameter, ψ, to an infinitesimal external perturbing field. Defined as the second derivative of the Landau–Pirouette Free Functional (ℱ) with respect to the perturbing field, χ_P quantifies the system's readiness to change its state of coherence. Near the critical adherence threshold (T_c), it diverges as a power law, χ_P ∝ |T_a - T_c|⁻ᵞ_P, where the universal critical exponent γ_P = 1 in the mean-field approximation.

          1. Bring the system near its critical point (T_a ≈ T_c).
          2. Apply a weak, oscillating external field (e.g., a modulated Ki drive) with a known amplitude and frequency.
          3. Measure the amplitude of the corresponding oscillation induced in the coherence order parameter (ψ).
          4. The susceptibility χ_P is the ratio of the response amplitude of ψ to the driving field amplitude, extrapolated to the zero-frequency limit.
        expected_signals: [A sharp peak in the power spectrum of ψ at the drive frequency, Power-law divergence of response amplitude as T_a → T_c]
        pitfalls: [Driving field must be weak enough to remain in the linear response regime, Critical slowing down near T_c requires long measurement times to reach equilibrium.]

        Coherence Susceptibility is a direct generalization of magnetic (or electric) susceptibility within the Landau theory of phase transitions. Both quantities measure the linear response of an order parameter (ψ for coherence, M for magnetization) to a conjugate external field and exhibit a power-law divergence at the second-order phase transition point, governed by the critical exponent γ.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from domain-specific susceptibilities. χ_P is a generalized measure tied to the abstract coherence order parameter ψ. While it may be operationally equivalent to a physical susceptibility in a specific context (e.g., in a spin system), its definition is fundamentally cross-domain.

# Coherence Susceptibility

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A measure of the linear response of the coherence order parameter, ψ, to an infinitesimal external perturbing field. Defined as the second derivative of the Landau–Pirouette Free Functional (ℱ) with respect to the perturbing field, χ_P quantifies the system's readiness to change its state of coherence. Near the critical adherence threshold (T_c), it diverges as a power law, χ_P ∝ |T_a - T_c|⁻ᵞ_P, where the universal critical exponent γ_P = 1 in the mean-field approximation.

## EFT-First Summary
Coherence Susceptibility (χ_P) is the direct analogue of magnetic susceptibility (χ_m) in the Landau theory of second-order phase transitions. It quantifies how strongly the system's order parameter (ψ, analogous to magnetization M) responds to an external field. This response diverges at the critical point, signaling an imminent phase transition where infinitesimal inputs can drive macroscopic change. This concept provides a universal, measurable marker for systemic instability across physical, cognitive, and social domains.
