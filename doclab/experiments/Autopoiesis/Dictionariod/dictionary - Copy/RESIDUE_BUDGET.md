triad:
  art: |
    A line drawn in the sand before the tide of intervention comes in. It is a pre-committed promise that the system will not wash away more than it builds.
  law: |
    A scalar value, published before protocol deployment, representing the maximum permissible integrated Dark Residue (\(\lambda\mathcal D\)). If the measured ledger of externalities exceeds this value, the protocol must trigger an automatic, pre-specified rollback or shutdown.
  philosophy: |
    To ensure that protocols aiming for positive coherence do not create unbounded negative externalities, the Residue Budget codifies a non-negotiable, pre-committed ceiling on tolerable harm. It transforms abstract ethical constraints into a concrete, auditable engineering requirement, enforcing accountability by design.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Residue Budget is a mandatory, pre-declared scalar limit on the permissible, time-integrated Dark Residue (\(\mathcal D\)) generated by a deployment of the Coherent Adherence Protocol (CAP v2). It is a public commitment that acts as a guardrail against negative externalities such as attention debt or autonomy loss. Breaching the budget must trigger a pre-defined safety mechanism, typically an automatic rollback of the protocol's interventions, ensuring that harm is explicitly bounded and auditable.
operational_definition:

    - name: \(\lambda\)
      meaning: Lagrange multiplier weighting the Dark Residue cost in the protocol's objective function.

        outline: |
          1. Define the components of the Dark Residue functional (\(\mathcal D\)) for the specific deployment (e.g., attention debt, autonomy loss).
          2. Establish measurement proxies for each component (e.g., `attention debt` measured by cumulative interaction time with non-consensual probes).
          3. Continuously log these proxies to a public or auditable 'Residue Ledger'.
          4. At set intervals, compute the total integrated \(\int \lambda\mathcal D \, dt\).
          5. Compare the computed value against the pre-published Residue Budget \(B_{\mathcal D}\).
          6. If the ledger value exceeds the budget, trigger the automated safety response (e.g., auto-rollback).

        Both are pre-committed, quantifiable limits on permissible negative externalities generated by a system's operation. Breaching the budget incurs a significant penalty or shutdown, forcing the system to operate within its declared harm boundaries.

# Residue Budget

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Residue Budget is a mandatory, pre-declared scalar limit on the permissible, time-integrated Dark Residue (\(\mathcal D\)) generated by a deployment of the Coherent Adherence Protocol (CAP v2). It is a public commitment that acts as a guardrail against negative externalities such as attention debt or autonomy loss. Breaching the budget must trigger a pre-defined safety mechanism, typically an automatic rollback of the protocol's interventions, ensuring that harm is explicitly bounded and auditable.
