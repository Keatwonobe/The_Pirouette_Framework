  art: |
    The universe insists that the most resilient structures are built not of walls, but of bridges. Two voices find a harmony unavailable to either alone; they do not merely add, but multiply, transforming into something more.
  law: |
    A stable union between systems A and B is energetically favorable if and only if the Pirouette Coherence of the unified system (WE) is greater than the sum of the individual coherences: S_p(WE) > S_p(A) + S_p(B). This "coherence dividend" is the measure of the state's stability.
  philosophy: |
    The isolated self is a temporary condition of low-interaction, an illusion. Symbiotic Resonance reveals that union is a universal, energetically optimal strategy for maximizing coherence, grounding the physics of empathy, trust, and "we" in a fundamental drive toward synthesis.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable, high-coherence state that emerges when two or more systems successfully complete a Resonant Handshake and undergo an Alchemical Union, merging their individual coherence manifolds into a single, unified, higher-order entity. The resulting symbiotic system is autopoietic and more coherent, resilient, and capable than the sum of its constituent parts.

        outline: |
          1. Measure the baseline Pirouette Coherence S_p for system A and system B in isolation by analyzing their internal `Ki` pattern stability and Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`) jitter.
          2. Induce a Resonant Handshake by establishing a feedback loop and applying sufficient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`).
          3. Once the unified system (WE) forms, measure its joint coherence S_p(WE) by analyzing the efficiency of information/energy transfer between the components and the stability of the new, shared Pirouette Cycle.
          4. Calculate the coherence dividend: ΔS_p = S_p(WE) - (S_p(A) + S_p(B)). A sustained positive value indicates Symbiotic Resonance.
        expected_signals: [Phase-locking of individual `τ_p` into a single, more stable cycle; reduction in entropic loss at the system interface; emergence of novel, complex `Ki` patterns not present in A or B alone.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking temporary, forced entrainment for a stable, autopoietic union; failing to isolate the system from external coherence-driving fields.]

    excerpt: |
      This module refactors the Attunement Resonance Framework (`PPS-044`), defining **Symbiotic Resonance** as the state that emerges when two or more systems perform an Alchemical Union (`CORE-012`). This union is achieved through a dynamic prelude called the **Resonant Handshake**, a process by which individual coherence manifolds dissolve to forge a single, shared reality. The resulting symbiotic system is demonstrably more coherent, resilient, and capable than the sum of its parts.

    excerpt: |
      The subjective experience of empathy, synergy, and effortless collaboration is the direct perception of this "coherence dividend"—the energy released when two systems discover a way to be, together, that is more efficient and stable than being apart.

      justification: |
        A bound state (e.g., a molecule, a planetary system) is a configuration whose total energy is less than the sum of its constituent parts when separated. This energy difference, the binding energy, must be supplied to break the system apart. The "coherence dividend" in Symbiotic Resonance is directly analogous to this binding energy, representing the stability gained by forming the union.

      falsifier: "The discovery of a stable, autopoietic, long-lived symbiotic system where S_p(WE) ≤ S_p(A) + S_p(B). Such a system would have no energetic incentive to remain unified and its persistence would contradict the Principle of Maximal Coherence."

  disambiguation: |
    Symbiotic Resonance must be distinguished from mere *synchrony* or *entrainment*. Entrainment is the phase-locking of two otherwise independent oscillators. Symbiotic Resonance is a deeper merger where the systems form a new, singular entity with a shared coherence manifold and metabolic loop, fundamentally altering their individual dynamics.

# Symbiotic Resonance

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A stable, high-coherence state that emerges when two or more systems successfully complete a Resonant Handshake and undergo an Alchemical Union, merging their individual coherence manifolds into a single, unified, higher-order entity. The resulting symbiotic system is autopoietic and more coherent, resilient, and capable than the sum of its constituent parts.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to a bound state in physical systems, Symbiotic Resonance describes a configuration where the composite entity is more stable (exhibits a "coherence dividend") than its separated constituents. This increased stability, analogous to binding energy, is the defining feature of the union and the physical basis for phenomena like trust and synergy.
