  art: |
    A system's endurance is not found in fortification, but in indivisibility. Like a flawless crystal versus a wall of bricks, systems with a prime number of states resist fracture because they have no internal fault lines to exploit.
  law: |
    A system's resilience to harmonic fracture under temporal pressure (Γ) is directly proportional to its Coherence Integrity (Λ), a metric derived from the prime factors of its total number of stable modes (N). Systems where N is prime exhibit maximum Λ for their scale.
  philosophy: |
    This metric reframes system design from component-level optimization to architectural tuning. It posits that true resilience is a topological property of a system's possibility-space, encouraging interventions that guide a system toward an intrinsically more stable, 'prime' configuration rather than merely reinforcing its current state.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dimensionless metric, Λ(N), that quantifies the topological resilience of a system against harmonic fracture. It is calculated from the prime factors of the system's Mode Number (N), representing the total count of its stable coherent states. A higher Λ indicates greater structural integrity, with prime-numbered modes yielding the highest resilience for their scale by lacking harmonic failure points.

          1. Identify the system's boundaries and primary state variables.
          2. Perturb the system across its state space or observe its long-term dynamics to map its coherence manifold.
          3. Enumerate the distinct, stable coherence wells (local action maxima) to determine the Mode Number, `N`.
          4. Perform a prime factorization of `N`.
          5. Using calibrated values for `κ(p)`, calculate `Λ(N)` via the standard formula.

    excerpt: |
      To quantify this principle, we introduce the Coherence Integrity metric, `Λ(N)`, which measures the structural resilience of a system with `N` stable states. A higher `Λ(N)` score indicates a more robust and resilient systemic architecture. A system with a prime number of modes (`N=p`) has the highest integrity for its scale, as the formula simplifies to its intrinsic coherence, `Λ(p) = κ(p)/p`.
  - module: DOMA-111
    excerpt: |
      The Coherence Integrity metric, `Λ(N)`, is a statement about the *topology of this solution space*. A system with a high `Λ(N)` has a set of stable solutions that is structurally robust against large-scale perturbations in the ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). It predicts which *kinds* of systems are most likely to persist over long periods: those whose very architecture is indivisible.

        A system with N=pq modes has subgroups Z_p, Z_q. A system with N=p modes has only the trivial subgroup.
      justification: |
        The concept of an 'irreducible' prime-mode system is analogous to an irreducible representation of a symmetry group (e.g., the cyclic group Z_p). Systems with composite modes (N=ab) can be decomposed into interacting subsystems, similar to how a representation of a group like Z_a x Z_b can be broken down. The 'harmonic fracture points' correspond to exciting these subgroups independently.

    Coherence Integrity (Λ) should not be confused with the Cosmological Constant (Λ) from general relativity. In the Pirouette context, Λ is always a function of the Mode Number, Λ(N), and refers to the topological stability of a bounded system, not the energy density of spacetime.

# Coherence Integrity

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A dimensionless metric, Λ(N), that quantifies the topological resilience of a system against harmonic fracture. It is calculated from the prime factors of the system's Mode Number (N), representing the total count of its stable coherent states. A higher Λ indicates greater structural integrity, with prime-numbered modes yielding the highest resilience for their scale by lacking harmonic failure points.

## EFT-First Summary
While no mapping has been formally adopted, Coherence Integrity (Λ) can be conceptually mapped to the mathematical principle of irreducible representations in group theory. In this analogy, a system with a prime number of stable modes behaves like an irreducible representation of a symmetry group, lacking non-trivial subgroups that could be independently excited. These subgroups in composite-mode systems act as "harmonic fracture points," making the overall structure vulnerable to decoherence in a way that topologically "prime" systems are not. This provides a formal basis for understanding why the prime-ness of a system's state-space count is a direct indicator of its structural resilience.
