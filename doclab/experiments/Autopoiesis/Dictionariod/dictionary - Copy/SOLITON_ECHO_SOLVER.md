  art: |
    A particle's quantum state, disturbed by a flaw in spacetime's weave, echoes back its true nature. The solver listens to this resonance, discerning the particle's intrinsic magnetic moment from the complex, non-linear reverberations of the vacuum.
  law: |
    The Soliton Echo Solver provides a deterministic, non-perturbative procedure to compute a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment `a_‚Ñì` by numerically solving the coupled Dirac and Œì-sector equations in the presence of a topological defect `T` and extracting the Pauli term coefficient `Œ∫_‚Ñì` via linear response to a probe field.
  philosophy: |
    To move beyond approximation, we must confront the full complexity of field interactions. The Solver embodies the principle that fundamental properties like `a_‚Ñì` are not merely perturbative corrections but are emergent results of a dynamic equilibrium between a particle and its structured vacuum, revealing deep structure where simpler methods see only a void.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Soliton Echo Solver is a numerical procedure defined in MATH-020 for calculating the non-perturbative contribution to a lepton's (`‚Ñì`) anomalous magnetic moment (`a_‚Ñì`). It solves the coupled, non-linear weak form of the Dirac equation and the Œì-sector field equations on a discretized domain (Œ©) containing a topological defect of index `T`. By applying a probe magnetic field (`Œ¥B`) and measuring the system's linear response, it extracts the Pauli term coefficient `Œ∫_‚Ñì`, from which `a_‚Ñì = Œ∫_‚Ñì/2` is determined. The procedure includes mandatory convergence checks (h-refinement), error budgeting, and artifact generation according to specified schemas.

          2. Establish a discretized finite element domain (Œ©) with symmetries and boundary conditions appropriate for the defect.
          3. Solve the non-linear system for (Œ®, Œì) using a Newton-Krylov or Picard method on a high-order FEM basis.
          4. Apply a small, static probe magnetic field `Œ¥B` to the converged solution.
          5. Compute the induced spin density or Pauli form factor F‚ÇÇ(q¬≤‚Üí0).
          6. Extract the coefficient `Œ∫_‚Ñì = F‚ÇÇ(0)` as the linear response, yielding `a_‚Ñì = Œ∫_‚Ñì/2`.

        Like Lattice QCD, the Solver is a first-principles numerical method for computing a non-perturbative contribution to a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment (`a_‚Ñì`). Whereas LQCD calculates the hadronic vacuum polarization on a discretized spacetime lattice, the Solver calculates contributions from the Pirouette-specific Œì-sector and topological defects on a finite element mesh.

  disambiguation: |
    The 'Soliton Echo Solver' (MATH-020 Section A) computes static properties like `a_‚Ñì`. It is distinct from the 'RG Coarse-Graining' procedure (Section B), which computes the scale-dependence (running) of couplings. It is a non-perturbative method and its results should not be directly compared to individual Feynman diagrams from perturbative QFT.

# Soliton Echo Solver

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Soliton Echo Solver is a numerical procedure defined in MATH-020 for calculating the non-perturbative contribution to a lepton's (`‚Ñì`) anomalous magnetic moment (`a_‚Ñì`). It solves the coupled, non-linear weak form of the Dirac equation and the Œì-sector field equations on a discretized domain (Œ©) containing a topological defect of index `T`. By applying a probe magnetic field (`Œ¥B`) and measuring the system's linear response, it extracts the Pauli term coefficient `Œ∫_‚Ñì`, from which `a_‚Ñì = Œ∫_‚Ñì/2` is determined. The procedure includes mandatory convergence checks (h-refinement), error budgeting, and artifact generation according to specified schemas.

## EFT-First Summary
The Soliton Echo Solver is an operational procedure analogous to first-principles calculations in other fields, such as Lattice QCD for hadronic physics. It provides a non-perturbative calculation of lepton `g-2` arising from couplings to the Pirouette-specific Œì-sector and topological defects. Its methodology‚Äîsolving a self-consistent field problem and extracting observables via linear response‚Äîis conceptually similar to Density Functional Theory in condensed matter.
