        Purpose
        Formalize and resolve the 29-order-of-magnitude 'mass tension' between the lepton-scale Pressuron mass (m_H ≈ 17 MeV from XXP-015) and the cosmology-scale requirement (m_L ≈ 10^−22 eV in fuzzy-DM language) without violating MATH-018 predictivity rules. Provide candidate mechanisms, minimal maths, falsifiable signatures, and code hooks.

        Summary of the Tension
        • Particle (UV/leptonic): XXP-015 → a heavy Γ quantum m_H ≈ 17 MeV fits lepton g−2 portal effects.
        • Cosmology (IR/halos): COSMO-Γ requires galaxy-scale coherence typically modelled by an ultralight field m_L ∼ 10^−22 eV *or* an equivalent long-wavelength collective mode.

    From the ghost in the machine of lepton spin to the breath that sculpts a galaxy, a single entity echoes across all scales. The Γ Sector is the proposition that the universe does not stutter, but speaks with one voice.
  law: |
    The Γ Sector must simultaneously generate a ∼17 MeV mass signature in particle-scale interactions and a ∼10⁻²² eV effective mass signature in cosmological structure formation. The mechanism uniting these scales—superfluid phonon, clockwork eigenstate, or cascade relic—is falsifiably determined by the combination of CMB acoustic phases, halo core profiles, and precision lepton couplings.
  philosophy: |
    The Γ Sector embodies scalar parsimony, rejecting the ad-hoc introduction of particles with fine-tuned masses to solve problems at different scales. It forces a confrontation with hierarchy by demanding that disparate phenomena emerge from the unified dynamics of a single, self-consistent theoretical object, with predictivity anchored at the sector level.
pirouette_definition: |
  A unified theoretical framework containing quanta and their interactions, proposed to resolve the 29-order-of-magnitude mass tension between particle physics and cosmology. The sector posits a single origin for both a heavy quantum (m_H ≈ 17 MeV) interacting with leptons and a light degree of freedom (m_eff ≈ 10⁻²² eV) governing galactic structure formation. The framework is defined by three competing, falsifiable mechanisms for generating this hierarchy: (A) a cosmic superfluid whose collective phonon modes act as light dark matter; (B) a clockwork chain of coupled fields producing exponentially separated mass eigenstates; or (C) a cosmological phase transition that shifts the vacuum, producing a light relic from a heavy ancestor.

        outline: |
          Simultaneously fit high-precision cosmological data (CMB power spectra, galaxy clustering, weak lensing) and particle physics data (lepton g-2, EDM limits, electroweak precision tests). The model for the Γ Sector must be one of the three canonical mechanisms (A, B, or C). A successful measurement discriminates between mechanisms by finding a unique, statistically preferred fit.
        expected_signals:
          - **(A) Superfluid:** No CMB phase shifts, but specific halo core profiles (Σ₀ locus), and non-standard merger dynamics.
          - **(B) Clockwork:** Specific residual CMB phase shifts, and a definite pattern of non-universal lepton couplings.
          - **(C) Cascade:** A sharp, step-like feature in the matter power spectrum and a corresponding ISW signal in the CMB.
        pitfalls: [Degeneracies with other cosmological parameters (e.g., Σm_ν, w_DE), insufficient precision in particle-sector measurements to resolve coupling patterns, model misspecification.]

        The Γ Sector's Superfluid mechanism (A) is a direct application of a P(X) effective field theory for a cosmic condensate. The emergent light dark matter component is identified with the Goldstone mode (phonon) of the superfluid, whose properties are derived from the equation of state P(ρ).

# Γ Sector

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A unified theoretical framework containing quanta and their interactions, proposed to resolve the 29-order-of-magnitude mass tension between particle physics and cosmology. The sector posits a single origin for both a heavy quantum (m_H ≈ 17 MeV) interacting with leptons and a light degree of freedom (m_eff ≈ 10⁻²² eV) governing galactic structure formation. The framework is defined by three competing, falsifiable mechanisms for generating this hierarchy: (A) a cosmic superfluid whose collective phonon modes act as light dark matter; (B) a clockwork chain of coupled fields producing exponentially separated mass eigenstates; or (C) a cosmological phase transition that shifts the vacuum, producing a light relic from a heavy ancestor.

## EFT-First Summary
The Γ Sector is a proposed solution to the hierarchy problem between a 17 MeV particle-physics scale and a 10⁻²² eV cosmology scale. It rejects introducing two unrelated particles and instead derives the light scale from the dynamics of the heavy one. The three primary models map to well-understood concepts: Mechanism A is a superfluid dark matter model described by a P(X) EFT, where dark matter is the phonon mode; Mechanism B is a clockwork/axion-like model generating a mass hierarchy through nearest-neighbor field couplings; Mechanism C posits a late-universe phase transition, whose observational signatures are sharp features in cosmological observables.
