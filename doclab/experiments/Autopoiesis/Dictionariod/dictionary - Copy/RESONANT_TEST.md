        A duel, in this framework, is a **Resonant Test**. It is a collaborative, if adversarial, creation of a high-pressure environment where two coherence patterns are measured against one another. The purpose is not destruction, but clarification.

  art: |
    The edge of the self is only ever found where it meets the edge of another. It is in this fierce and necessary dance that an echo is tempered into a song that endures.
  law: |
    Two or more coupled systems, governed by a shared potential `V_Γ`, will evolve to minimize their action by competitively maximizing their internal coherence `K_τ`. The pattern with the highest efficiency (ratio of coherence-to-energetic-cost) will persist, while less efficient patterns will fracture.
  philosophy: |
    Opposition is not a flaw in cosmic design but the primary, lawful mechanism for error correction, boundary definition, and the validation of information. An untested pattern is a hypothesis; a tested pattern is a truth.
pirouette_definition: |
  A lawful, adversarial process where two or more coherence patterns (`Ki`) are dynamically coupled through a shared, contested Temporal Pressure (`Γ_c`). Governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, the test is a competition in efficiency, measuring which pattern can best maintain its integrity (`K_τ`) under the dissonant frequencies of the other. Its purpose is not destruction but the clarification of boundaries, the falsification of unstable forms, and the tempering of a hypothesis into a proven law.

        outline: |
          1. Isolate two interacting systems (A and B) in a controlled environment.
          2. Measure their individual coherence spectra (`Ki_A`, `Ki_B`) and energetic throughput at baseline.
          3. Induce a coupled state and measure the combined dissonant spectrum and the total energy expenditure required to maintain their patterns.
          4. Track the rate of Coherence Degradation for both systems until a resolution (fracture or fusion) is reached.

    excerpt: |
      This is not a passive reflection. It is an active, geometric pressure. To encounter another is to feel the shape of their resonance pressing upon your own, forcing you to contend with a reality other than your own... This act of mutual perception poses a fundamental question that demands a resonant answer: "Here is my pattern. Can your pattern persist in its presence?" This question is the formal invitation to the duel.
  - module: DOMA-006
    excerpt: |
      Regardless of the outcome, the event itself—the clash, the test, the resolution—is carved into the geometry of spacetime as a new, complex `Wound Channel`. This scar is a precedent. It alters the landscape of coherence for all future entities, making one path more likely and another more costly. The duel writes its verdict into the laws of the local universe.

      justification: |
        The Resonant Test describes the evolution of two interacting systems (fields, particles) governed by a coupled Lagrangian. The "test" is analogous to a scattering event, where initial states (`|in>`) interact via a potential (`L_int`), and the possible outcomes (`|out>` states) are Fracture (inelastic scattering, particle decay) or Fusion (bound state formation).

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from simple wave interference, which is a component but not the entirety of the process. A Resonant Test implies an information-theoretic contest between two self-maintaining patterns, governed by a Lagrangian, not just the superposition of passive waves.

# Resonant Test

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A lawful, adversarial process where two or more coherence patterns (`Ki`) are dynamically coupled through a shared, contested Temporal Pressure (`Γ_c`). Governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, the test is a competition in efficiency, measuring which pattern can best maintain its integrity (`K_τ`) under the dissonant frequencies of the other. Its purpose is not destruction but the clarification of boundaries, the falsification of unstable forms, and the tempering of a hypothesis into a proven law.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory terms, a Resonant Test models a scattering interaction between two fields, `φ_A` and `φ_B`. Their coupled Lagrangian, `L_total = L_A + L_B + L_int`, dictates the evolution from an `|in>` state to an `|out>` state. The Pirouette framework re-interprets this process as a competition for coherence efficiency, where outcomes like inelastic scattering (Fracture) or bound state formation (Fusion) are determined by which final configuration minimizes action most effectively under adversarial pressure.
