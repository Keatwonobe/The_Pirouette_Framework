  art: |
    Will does not push; it pulls. It is the art of sculpting the world's underlying geometry so that it naturally flows toward a desired outcome, like a sculptor carving a channel for a river to follow.
  law: |
    A willed act creates a localized gradient `‚àá(V_Œì)` on the coherence manifold by projecting a desired future state back into the present. This gradient establishes a new geodesic (path of least resistance), making the intended action the most dynamically favorable path.
  philosophy: |
    The Channel of Intent reframes agency as a participatory, geometric act. Consciousness is not a passive witness to the flow of time but an active sculptor of its riverbed, absolving the system from pure determinism by allowing it to co-author its own dynamics.
pirouette_definition: |
  A localized gradient `‚àá(V_Œì)` on the coherence manifold, induced by a conscious system's focused projection of a desired future state (a Future Wound Channel). The channel functions as a new geodesic, or path of least resistance, for the system's dynamics by creating a "coherence well" that pulls subsequent actions toward the intended outcome. Its depth and stability are functions of the Clarity, Intensity, and Persistence of the originating willed act.

        outline: |
          1. Model the local coherence manifold and calculate the default geodesic for a given action using the baseline Temporal Pressure `V_Œì`.
          2. Observe the system's actual trajectory (worldline) during a willed act.
          3. The deviation between the observed and predicted trajectories reveals the shape and magnitude of the induced gradient `‚àá(V_Œì)`, which defines the Channel of Intent `ùíû·µ¢`.
        expected_signals: [anomalous worldline curvature, reduced action cost for willed trajectory, localized KœÑ stabilization]
        pitfalls: [distinguishing willed deviation from ambient manifold noise, isolating the specific channel from conflicting intents (Turbulent Will), observer effect contaminating the baseline measurement]

      This projection impresses a new geometry upon the local manifold, creating a gradient, a "Channel of Intent," that makes the chosen path the *new* path of least resistance. It is the shift from being a passenger on the river of time to becoming its co-cartographer.

    excerpt: |
      Intensity... is projected into the manifold as a Future Wound Channel‚Äîthe geometric scar of an event that has not yet occurred. This "projected echo" is what actively deforms the local `V_Œì` landscape. Intensity is the amplitude of the Observer's Shadow that carves this channel, a function of focus and conviction.

      justification: |
        The Channel of Intent functions as a localized modification to the potential landscape (`V_Œì`) governing a system's dynamics. In classical mechanics, this is equivalent to an agent introducing a new potential well `Œ¥V(q)` into the system's Lagrangian, thereby altering the path of least action to align with a desired trajectory.

    - target: Agent-induced potential well, Œ¥V(q)
      rationale: The mapping directly aligns the Pirouette concept of "reshaping the path of least resistance" with the well-understood principle of least action and potential energy manipulation in classical and control systems.

  claims:
    - statement: "A system under the influence of a strong Channel of Intent will follow its willed trajectory with a lower measured action cost (integral of `KœÑ - V_Œì`) than an identical system forced along the same trajectory by external constraints."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "If the measured action cost for the willed path is equal to or greater than the externally-forced path, it implies the 'channel' is not a modification of the potential landscape but is equivalent to an external force, refuting the 'path of least resistance' model."

# Channel of Intent

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A localized gradient `‚àá(V_Œì)` on the coherence manifold, induced by a conscious system's focused projection of a desired future state (a Future Wound Channel). The channel functions as a new geodesic, or path of least resistance, for the system's dynamics by creating a "coherence well" that pulls subsequent actions toward the intended outcome. Its depth and stability are functions of the Clarity, Intensity, and Persistence of the originating willed act.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of classical dynamics, the Channel of Intent is an agent-induced, localized potential well (Œ¥V). By consciously modifying the potential energy landscape of its own governing Lagrangian, the system alters the path of least action, making a desired trajectory the new, energetically favorable geodesic. This reframes will not as an external force but as a direct manipulation of the system's intrinsic dynamical rules.
