        A Tier 1 audit MUST be initiated when the **Pressure (P)** channel shows a sustained, anomalous increase *without* a corresponding, functional expression in the **Resonance (R)** channel. This signature—the whisper of rising stress without release—is the canonical indicator of a system approaching a state of coherence collapse or a painful phase transition.

triad:
  art: |
    The held breath before the scream; the tightening bowstring before the snap. It is the art of hearing a system's silent plea for intervention.
  law: |
    A Tier 1 audit is mandated when the rate of change of Pressure (`dP/dt`) is positive and sustained over a characteristic time `τ`, while the corresponding rate of change of Resonance (`dR/dt`) is negligible or negative.
  philosophy: |
    To watch everything is to see nothing. The Sentinel Trigger operationalizes strategic attention, focusing the Weaver's finite resources on nascent instabilities *before* they cascade into catastrophic failure, transforming diagnostics from a forensic to a preventative art.
pirouette_definition: |
  A specific diagnostic condition within the Tiered Audit Protocol where system Pressure (a measure of potential energy `V_Γ`) exhibits a sustained, anomalous increase without a corresponding release into coherent Resonance (a measure of kinetic energy `K_τ`). This P/R divergence signals imminent coherence collapse or a destabilizing phase transition, and serves as the mandatory trigger for a Tier 1 Guard Band audit.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (it is a condition based on rates of change)
  symbol_table:
    - name: P
      meaning: System Pressure, a proxy for the Lagrangian potential term `V_Γ`.
      dimensions: Contextual (e.g., bits, joules)
      default_range: Contextual
    - name: R
      meaning: System Resonance, a proxy for the Lagrangian kinetic term `K_τ`.
      dimensions: Contextual (e.g., bits/s, watts)
      default_range: Contextual
    - name: τ
      meaning: Characteristic time window for the system.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline correlation model and variance for P and R channels for the target system in a stable state.
          2. Continuously monitor both channels using low-cost proxies (Tier 0).
          3. Calculate rolling derivatives (`dP/dt`, `dR/dt`) over the system-specific time window `τ`.
          4. The trigger fires if `dP/dt > ε_P` while `|dR/dt| < ε_R` for a duration exceeding a persistence threshold `τ_sustain`, where `ε` are significance thresholds derived from the baseline.
        expected_signals: [Time-series data for Pressure, Time-series data for Resonance]
        pitfalls: [Proxy model drift (P/R proxies no longer reflect true Lagrangian terms), Incorrect time window `τ` (too short causes false positives; too long misses the event), Miscalibrated significance thresholds (`ε`).]

      A Tier 1 audit MUST be initiated when the **Pressure (P)** channel shows a sustained, anomalous increase *without* a corresponding, functional expression in the **Resonance (R)** channel. This signature—the whisper of rising stress without release—is the canonical indicator of a system approaching a state of coherence collapse or a painful phase transition. It is the system's silent scream, its cry for help before the crisis.
  - module: DOMA-094
    excerpt: |
      **Coherence Collapse**: **P** trends toward infinity while **R** stagnates or drops to zero. The Sentinel Trigger has been tripped. A terminal state or catastrophic phase transition is imminent.

        σ = Eε (Hooke's Law) fails as dσ/dt > 0 while dε/dt → 0.
      justification: |
        Pressure (P) acts as applied stress (σ), while Resonance (R) represents the system's coherent response or elastic strain (ε). A Sentinel Trigger is analogous to the region beyond the elastic limit, where applied stress continues to increase but the system no longer responds with proportional, elastic strain, indicating imminent material failure (brittle fracture) or a permanent change in state (plastic deformation).

  claims:
    - statement: "All systems exhibiting coherence collapse are preceded by a detectable Sentinel Trigger event, assuming a correctly calibrated Auditor's Lens."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observation of a spontaneous coherence collapse in a well-monitored system where the P and R channels remained tightly correlated until the moment of failure. This would imply either the trigger is not a universal precursor or that some collapses are driven by dynamics not captured by the Lagrangian's P and R terms."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from "sentinel values" in computer science, which are in-band terminators for data structures. The Pirouette "Sentinel Trigger" is not a data value but a dynamic, out-of-band condition monitoring a system's state, akin to a watchdog timer or a geological precursor signal for an earthquake.
