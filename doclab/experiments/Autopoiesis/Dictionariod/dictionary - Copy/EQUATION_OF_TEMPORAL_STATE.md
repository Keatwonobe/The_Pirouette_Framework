    Where the Higgs curves the energy of space, the Pressuron bends the rhythm of time—two halves of a single cosmic heartbeat. The Equation of Temporal State is the law governing their resonance.
  law: |
    The coupling between the Higgs (coherence density) and the Pressuron Γ (temporal pressure) is described by the interaction Lagrangian `L_int = λ_HΓ H†H Γ²`. This interaction induces a positive correction to the total Higgs width of ~0.1%–0.3% and enhances the H→e⁺e⁻ branching ratio to ~10⁻⁷, both of which are experimentally falsifiable.
  philosophy: |
    This equation elevates the Higgs field from a static source of mass to a dynamic participant in cosmic evolution. It proposes that electroweak vacuum stability is not an isolated accident but is actively linked to the damping of temporal pressure, thus giving mass a form of memory.

  A dynamical framework describing the interaction between the Higgs field (H) and the Pressuron field (Γ). In this framework, the Higgs represents the *density of coherence* and the Pressuron represents *temporal pressure*. Their coupling, mediated by the interaction term `L_int = λ_HΓ H†H Γ²`, acts as a pressure-density cross-term that governs the energy exchange between the electroweak vacuum and temporal dynamics, modulating the Higgs VEV and linking its stability to cosmic coherence.

          1. At a high-luminosity particle collider (e.g., HL-LHC, FCC), precisely measure the total decay width of the Higgs boson (Γ_H) using off-shell production or direct lineshape scans.
          2. Simultaneously, search for rare dilepton decays of the Higgs, particularly H→e⁺e⁻ and H→μ⁺μ⁻, and measure their branching ratios (BR).
          3. Compare the measured Γ_H and BR values against the Standard Model predictions.

      The Higgs field represents the **density of coherence**, while Γ encodes **temporal pressure**.
      Their coupling is therefore the *pressure-density cross-term* in the equation of temporal state.
      At resonance, the two fields share energy, letting the Higgs “breathe” in time: a periodic modulation of its vacuum expectation value... This oscillation damps as the universe expands, linking electroweak vacuum stability to cosmic coherence.

      A null result at sensitivities below (10⁻⁷) on (H→e⁺e⁻) or better than 0.1 % on total width would **exclude** this baseline coupling and require a tensor or derivative re-formulation (→ DYNA-Γ-HIGGS-TAIL).

        The core Lagrangian term `λ_HΓ H†H Γ²` is a canonical example of a renormalizable "Higgs portal" interaction. In this common BSM framework, a new scalar field (Γ, denoted generically as S) couples to the Standard Model solely through the Higgs field operator H†H. This provides a minimal and predictive link between the visible and a hidden/new sector.

    Unlike a standard thermodynamic or cosmological Equation of State (e.g., P = wρ) which relates properties of a *single* fluid, the Pirouette Equation of Temporal State describes the *interaction dynamics* between two distinct fields: the Higgs (coherence density) and the Pressuron (temporal pressure). It is a law of coupling, not a property of a substance.

# Equation of temporal state

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A dynamical framework describing the interaction between the Higgs field (H) and the Pressuron field (Γ). In this framework, the Higgs represents the *density of coherence* and the Pressuron represents *temporal pressure*. Their coupling, mediated by the interaction term `L_int = λ_HΓ H†H Γ²`, acts as a pressure-density cross-term that governs the energy exchange between the electroweak vacuum and temporal dynamics, modulating the Higgs VEV and linking its stability to cosmic coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of effective field theory, the Equation of Temporal State is implemented via a **Higgs portal interaction**, `L ⊃ λ_HΓ H†H Γ²`, coupling the Standard Model Higgs (H) to a new scalar field, the Pressuron (Γ). This interaction is a well-studied portal to physics beyond the Standard Model. It naturally introduces new decay channels for the Higgs and modifies its total width, providing concrete, falsifiable signatures for particle colliders like the LHC and future lepton colliders. It serves as the primary mechanism linking electroweak vacuum stability to the dynamics of the proposed temporal pressure field.
