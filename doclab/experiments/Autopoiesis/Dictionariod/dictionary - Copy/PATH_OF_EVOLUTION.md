  art: |
    A system's journey is not a fall into darkness but a climb toward the light. It follows the contours of grace up the mountain of its own potential, seeking the peak where its song rings truest.
  law: |
    A system's state vector S evolves over time by following the integral curve of the Coherence Landscape's gradient. The trajectory Œ≥_p satisfies the condition dŒ≥_p/dt ‚àù ‚àáùìõ_p(Œ≥_p(t)), terminating at a local maximum of ùìõ_p.
  philosophy: |
    This reframes evolution not as a passive wandering through a landscape of constraints, but as an active, directed striving toward states of greater elegance, efficiency, and resonant expression. It posits an intrinsic teleology toward coherence in all systems.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Path of Evolution is the trajectory within a system's state space that follows the path of steepest ascent on its Coherence Landscape. Mathematically, it is the integral curve of the gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian (‚àáùìõ_p), originating from a given initial state. This path represents the system's most probable, deterministic evolutionary trajectory toward a stable attractor (a peak of ùìõ_p).

          1.  Define the system's state space S and map its Coherence Landscape, ùìõ_p(S), per the protocol in DOMA-139.

          3.  Given an initial state S(0), numerically integrate the differential equation dS/dt = k‚àáùìõ_p(S), where k is a system-specific kinetic constant, to trace the path Œ≥_p(t).
          4.  Verify that the path terminates at a point S_f where ‚àáùìõ_p(S_f) ‚âà 0 and S_f is a local maximum.

      justification: |
        The Path of Evolution is defined as the continuous trajectory that follows the gradient of a scalar field (ùìõ_p). This is the direct continuous analogue of the gradient ascent optimization algorithm, which iteratively steps in the direction of the gradient to find a local maximum.

      justification: |
        In computational chemistry, the IRC is the minimum energy path connecting states on a potential energy surface. The Path of Evolution is the conceptual dual: the maximum *coherence* path connecting states on a coherence landscape. Both define the most probable, lowest-action path between system configurations.

  disambiguation: |
    This term refers to the deterministic dynamics of a system on a static Coherence Landscape, analogous to an object rolling on a surface. It does not describe the mechanisms (e.g., mutation) that might change the landscape itself over longer timescales. It is a path of *becoming*, not a path of *origin*.

# Path of Evolution

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Path of Evolution is the trajectory within a system's state space that follows the path of steepest ascent on its Coherence Landscape. Mathematically, it is the integral curve of the gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian (‚àáùìõ_p), originating from a given initial state. This path represents the system's most probable, deterministic evolutionary trajectory toward a stable attractor (a peak of ùìõ_p).

## EFT-First Summary
The Path of Evolution is the trajectory a system follows in its state space, mathematically equivalent to a gradient ascent path on a scalar field. This field, the Coherence Landscape (`ùìõ_p`), acts as the objective function the system seeks to maximize. The path represents the most probable, deterministic evolution towards a stable state (an attractor) and is the direct physical realization of the gradient ascent optimization algorithm.
