    The universe levies a tax on all ordered patterns. This is the price of coherence, the rent a system pays to the chaotic environment for the temporary privilege of existence.
  law: |
    The Entropy Tax (V_Œì) is the quantity of a system's gross internal coherence (K_œÑ) that is rendered unavailable for work due to thermal coupling with an environment at temperature T. It is precisely quantified as V_Œì = TS, where S = -(‚àÇF/‚àÇT)_V.
  philosophy: |
    The tax is not a flaw or a sign of decay, but a fundamental accounting principle. It reveals that existence is a negotiated state, a constant transaction between internal order and external chaos, ensuring no system can be an island.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Entropy Tax is the Pirouette Environmental Potential, V_Œì, when the dominant environmental interaction is thermal noise. It represents the component of a system's Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ) that must be continuously expended to counteract decoherence from an environment at a non-zero temporal temperature (T). The Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì) is thus the net coherence remaining after this tax has been paid.

        DOMA-144 establishes a direct identity between the Pirouette Environmental Potential (V_Œì) and the classical thermodynamic entropic cost (TS). V_Œì represents the cost of maintaining coherence against environmental noise, which is macroscopically manifested as the energy made unavailable for work by thermal disorder, quantified by TS. This is the central claim of the Thermodynamic Correspondence Principle.

    Distinguish from the "cost of work" (the PV term in Enthalpy/Gibbs), which can be seen as a tax on *space*, not on *coherence*. Entropy Tax is paid to the thermal environment for existing at all; PV work is paid to the mechanical environment for occupying a volume.

# Entropy Tax

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Entropy Tax is the Pirouette Environmental Potential, V_Œì, when the dominant environmental interaction is thermal noise. It represents the component of a system's Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ) that must be continuously expended to counteract decoherence from an environment at a non-zero temporal temperature (T). The Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì) is thus the net coherence remaining after this tax has been paid.

## EFT-First Summary
In standard thermodynamics, the Entropy Tax is the quantity `TS` (Temperature times Entropy) which appears in the definitions of Helmholtz and Gibbs free energy (`F = U - TS`, `G = H - TS`). It represents the amount of a system's internal energy (`U`) that is unavailable to perform isothermal work due to thermal disorder. The Pirouette Framework identifies this term as the direct macroscopic manifestation of the Environmental Potential (`V_Œì`) in the fundamental Pirouette Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`, making thermodynamics an emergent consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. (Ref: H.B. Callen, *Thermodynamics*).
