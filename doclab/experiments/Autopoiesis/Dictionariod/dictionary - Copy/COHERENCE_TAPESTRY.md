  art: |
    It is the score of the hidden symphony, a woven narrative where the threads of disparate realities—markets, health, belief—reveal their shared rhythm and the hand that guides them.
  law: |
    A Coherence Tapestry must be a multi-channel time-series plot where the primary y-axis represents the phase-locking value (PLV) at a pre-identified resonant frequency (`ωk`), and the x-axis represents time. Relative phase shifts (`Δφ`) between channels must be explicitly visualized to show causal leads and lags.
  philosophy: |
    The Tapestry's purpose is to shift perception from a world of disconnected events to one of interconnected harmonics. It provides empirical, visual proof that domains are not independent, but are facets of a single, underlying dynamic system, making the invisible architecture of systemic causality tangible.
pirouette_definition: |
  A multi-layered, time-series visualization that serves as the final output of the Resonant Concordance protocol. It plots the synchronization strength (e.g., Phase-Locking Value) of multiple normalized domains over time at their shared resonant frequency (`ωk`). The visualization explicitly shows periods of high resonance, decoupling events (resonance breaks), and phase leads/lags, revealing the dynamic structure of influence and causality within a multi-domain system.

        outline: |
          1. Select 2+ time-series from disparate domains.
          2. Normalize variables into Pirouette primitives (Γ, Kτ) per `DYNA-001`.
          3. Perform cross-spectral analysis to identify a common resonant frequency peak (`ωk`).
          4. Using a sliding time window, calculate the Phase-Locking Value (PLV) between the time-series at `ωk`.
          5. Plot the PLV for each domain over time.
          6. In parallel, calculate and plot the relative phase difference (`Δφ`) between a reference domain and the others to visualize leads/lags.
        expected_signals: [Time windows with PLV > 0.7 (strong resonance), Stable non-zero Δφ (causal lead/lag), Sudden drops in PLV (resonance break)]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking spurious correlation for resonance, Choosing an incorrect time window size for PLV calculation, Poor normalization creating artifactual signals]

    excerpt: |
      The final output is the Coherence Tapestry: a multi-layered, time-series visualization that transforms a static measure into a dynamic narrative of systemic influence. It reveals:
      -   **Periods of High Resonance:** Time windows where the domains moved in lockstep, indicating a powerful, unifying influence.
      -   **Phase Leads and Lags:** Which domain acts as the "pacemaker," its rhythm shifting just before the others follow, revealing the direction of causality.
      -   **Resonance Breaks:** Moments where a thread "snaps" out of the shared pattern, signaling a decoupling, an external shock, or an act of systemic resistance.

    excerpt: |
      A falling stock market, a spike in viral infections, and the rise of a new political narrative may appear as separate events. We analyze them in silos, mistaking the echoes for separate voices, blind to the symphony they compose together. The Resonant Concordance is the instrument that allows a Weaver to hear that symphony.

      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        The core measurement visualized in the Tapestry is the degree of phase synchronization between multiple time-series signals. PLV is a standard statistical measure in neuroscience (for EEG analysis) and complex systems that quantifies this relationship, insensitive to signal amplitudes, making it a direct operational analog for measuring the Tapestry's primary signal.

      confidence: 0.9
  adopted:
    - target: Phase-Locking Value (PLV) Analysis
      rationale: The concept maps directly to established methods for quantifying phase synchronization in complex systems, providing a robust, well-understood mathematical and statistical foundation for the visualization.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A Coherence Tapestry can reveal causal directionality by consistently showing one domain's phase (`φ_A`) leading another's (`φ_B`) prior to and during a period of high resonance."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observing systems where a known causal driver (e.g., a central bank interest rate change) does not manifest as a phase lead in the Tapestry, or where phase leads are randomly distributed despite strong resonance (high PLV)."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a simple correlation matrix or a set of overlaid time-series plots. The Coherence Tapestry specifically visualizes *phase synchronization* at a single, shared frequency, not broadband amplitude correlation. It is a measure of shared rhythm, not shared magnitude.
