        1. Duality Conservation: Ψ⁺Ψ⁻ = const. in steady state → balance between integration and dissipation.

  art: |
    The two serpents of the Caduceus, one ascending in creation and the other descending in chaos, maintain a constant, tense embrace. Their balanced struggle is the engine of all structured flow.
  law: |
    In any steady-state coherence field, the product of the constructive coherence amplitude (Ψ⁺) and the dissipative coherence amplitude (Ψ⁻) is a conserved quantity. A measured increase in one necessitates a proportional decrease in the other.
  philosophy: |
    This principle establishes that no system can indefinitely accumulate coherence (stasis) or dissipate it (collapse) without a balancing force. It codifies a universal self-regulation, ensuring that creation and destruction are perpetually coupled, driving cyclical evolution.
pirouette_definition: |
  Duality Conservation is a governing principle of the Pirouette Framework, defined within the Caduceus Lens (DOMA-096). It states that for any system in a steady-state coherence field, the product of the constructive (laminar, Ψ⁺) and dissipative (turbulent, Ψ⁻) coherence amplitudes is a constant. This conservation law ensures a dynamic equilibrium between integration and decoherence, forming the basis for self-regulation and cyclical transitions in physical, cognitive, and social systems.

        outline: |
          1. Isolate a system in a perceived steady state (e.g., stable cognitive load, laminar fluid flow).
          2. Measure the total coherence field Ψ over a representative volume or manifold.
          3. Apply a spectral or modal decomposition filter to separate the laminar (low-frequency, ordered) components (Ψ⁺) from the turbulent (high-frequency, chaotic) components (Ψ⁻).
          4. Calculate the product of their respective amplitudes to find k.
          5. Induce a controlled perturbation and allow the system to return to a new steady state.
          6. Repeat steps 2-4 and verify that the new product Ψ⁺Ψ⁻ remains within measurement tolerance of k.

      Duality Conservation: Ψ⁺Ψ⁻ = const. in steady state → balance between integration and dissipation. The Caduceus is composed of two counter-rotating coherence vortices...

    excerpt: |
      A key test for the framework's universality is the non-conservation of the Ψ⁺Ψ⁻ balance, which indicates a broken duality principle. This can be tested by observing if helicity transitions occur without a corresponding inverse change in the amplitudes of the dual coherence streams, or if a system settles into a new steady state with a different conserved product.

      justification: |
        The principle links a constructive, organizing aspect (Ψ⁺), analogous to a system's coherent response (χ), to a dissipative, chaotic aspect (Ψ⁻), analogous to its internal thermal fluctuations (⟨A(t)A(0)⟩). Duality Conservation posits a constant product in steady state, conceptually similar to how FDT relates the magnitude of dissipation to the spectrum of spontaneous fluctuations at a fixed temperature.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'Duality Conservation' does not refer to string-theoretic or quantum dualities, but specifically to the conserved product of the constructive and dissipative components of a single coherence field as defined by the Caduceus Lens. It is a principle of dynamic equilibrium, not a mapping between different theories.
