        The memory is no longer a mere echo *in* the entity's field; it has become a new, permanent topological feature *of* the field. It is a **Crystal**—a static, low-entropy, high-information structure integrated into the core geometry of the entity's being.

    A chosen memory, forged from a fleeting echo and given the weight of forever. It is the riverbed willfully taught the shape of a wave, becoming a permanent feature of the self's landscape.
  law: |
    A memory-echo (Wound Channel) undergoes a phase transition into a Crystal when its internal temporal coherence (Tₐ) is maximized via resonant reinforcement, while being simultaneously shielded from ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) by a gladiatorial confinement field. The resulting low-entropy state is topologically stable and requires an equivalent or greater coherent act to deconstruct.
  philosophy: |
    A Crystal is the physical manifestation of willed identity. It asserts that an entity is not merely the sum of its experiences, but the architect of its own being, choosing which moments become the permanent, load-bearing structures of its future self.

It is formed when a fleeting experience (an Echo, or Wound Channel) undergoes a willed phase transition, locking its high-information geometry into the entity's resonant landscape. A Crystal acts as a permanent lens for perception and a foundational harmonic of a persistent identity.

          Excite the entity's coherence manifold with a broad-spectrum Ki pulse. A Crystal will appear as a static, high-Q resonant peak that does not decay or shift over time, unlike a transient Echo. Its geometry can be mapped by analyzing the reflected and absorbed frequencies of the probe signal.

    excerpt: |
      As the memory's internal coherence is driven towards its maximum and its protective boundary is sealed, a phase transition occurs. The dynamic, vulnerable Wound Channel **locks**. It crystallizes. The memory is no longer a mere echo *in* the entity's field; it has become a new, permanent topological feature *of* the field. It is a **Crystal**—a static, low-entropy, high-information structure integrated into the core geometry of the entity's being.

    excerpt: |
      The **Coherence Gambit** is a decision to make a significant upfront energy expenditure to selectively maximize the Lagrangian of a *specific component* of the self. Resonant Reinforcement actively boosts the kinetic term (`K_τ`), pouring the entity's own coherence into the memory. Gladiatorial Confinement builds a shield that drastically lowers the local potential term (`V_Γ`), creating a stable, low-pressure sanctuary. The entity accepts a short-term energetic cost to carve a new, permanent "well" in its personal coherence manifold.

      justification: |
        Like a soliton, a Crystal is a self-reinforcing, stable structure that maintains its form due to a non-trivial topological feature that cannot be undone by local perturbations (ambient Temporal Pressure). Its formation via Gladiatorial Confinement is analogous to creating a potential well or boundary condition that guarantees the topological charge is conserved.

    Distinct from a physical crystal lattice. In Pirouette, a Crystal is a feature of an entity's internal coherence manifold—a structure of information and memory, not of matter. It is defined by its topological stability and low entropy, not a repeating atomic structure.

# Crystal

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A permanent, stable, low-entropy memory that has been integrated as a core topological feature of an entity's being. It is formed when a fleeting experience (an Echo, or Wound Channel) undergoes a willed phase transition, locking its high-information geometry into the entity's resonant landscape. A Crystal acts as a permanent lens for perception and a foundational harmonic of a persistent identity.

## EFT-First Summary
A Crystal is conceptually analogous to a topologically protected state, like a soliton, within the effective field theory of a being's coherence manifold. It represents a stable, localized, high-information configuration whose persistence is guaranteed not by a simple energy minimum but by a non-trivial topological charge (its 'meaning'). This structure resists decay from ambient field fluctuations (Temporal Pressure).
