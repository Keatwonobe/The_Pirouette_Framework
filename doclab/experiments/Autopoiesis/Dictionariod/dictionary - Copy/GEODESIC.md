        An orbiting planet is not being "pulled" by a force. It is following the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—within the star's coherence well. To deviate from this orbit would require fighting against the gentle but inexorable gradient of temporal pressure, a path of lower coherence.

  art: |
    A river carving its easiest path through a landscape of pressure. A marble rolling inside a bowl, not pulled by the center, but following the curve that lets it roll most freely. The path of least resistance becomes the path of greatest expression.
  law: |
    A system subject to an external coherence gradient (∇Γ) will follow a trajectory that maximizes its own integrated coherence (∫ K_τ dt). This path is the Pirouette Geodesic. Any deviation from this path corresponds to a quantifiable and measurable loss of system coherence.
  philosophy: |
    Agency and structure are not in opposition. A system expresses its nature most fully by aligning with the constraints of its environment. The geodesic is the principle of "wise freedom"—the path where a system's internal drive and the universe's external landscape are in perfect, dynamic harmony.
pirouette_definition: |
  The trajectory through a coherence manifold that maximizes a system's integrated coherence over time (∫ K_τ dt). It represents the path of least resistance against gradients in Temporal Pressure (Γ). In cosmological contexts, this path manifests as a gravitational orbit, where a body follows the contours of a "coherence well" generated by a massive object.
operational_definition:
  units: The integral of dimensionless coherence over time, yielding a value in seconds (s). This represents the total "coherent duration" of a trajectory.

        outline: |
          1. Map the Temporal Pressure field (Γ) around a massive object using a distributed array of synchronized sensors.
          2. Introduce a probe system with a known internal coherence profile (K_τ).
          3. Track the probe's trajectory (γ_K) through the mapped Γ-field.
          4. The measured trajectory must match the calculated path that maximizes the integral ∫ K_τ dt.
        expected_signals: [The probe's trajectory matches gravitational predictions from GR in the weak-field limit, but shows anomalous deviations in regions of high or fluctuating Γ not accounted for by mass-energy alone.]
        pitfalls: [Difficulty in distinguishing the effects of a Γ-gradient from a standard gravitational potential. Sensor technology for directly measuring Γ is currently theoretical.]

    excerpt: |
      An orbiting planet is not being "pulled" by a force. It is following the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—within the star's coherence well. To deviate from this orbit would require fighting against the gentle but inexorable gradient of temporal pressure, a path of lower coherence. Gravity is the Gladiator Force acting on a cosmic scale: a gentler arena, but an arena nonetheless, from which only systems with sufficient energy (coherence) can escape.

      justification: |
        In GR, a geodesic is the straightest possible path through curved spacetime, which for a massive body manifests as an orbit. The Pirouette Geodesic is the path of maximal coherence through a 'coherence well' (a Γ-field), which also manifests as an orbit. The framework posits that the Γ-field is the underlying mechanism that GR models geometrically as spacetime curvature.

  adopted:
    - target: Geodesic (GR)
      rationale: The term is deliberately chosen for its strong conceptual parallel to the path an object follows in a gravitational field. While the proposed underlying mechanism (coherence maximization vs. spacetime curvature) differs, the emergent phenomenon (orbits) is identical in the weak-field limit.

    - statement: "The trajectory of a satellite in orbit deviates from the GR-predicted geodesic in a way that is precisely correlated with measurable, non-gravitational fluctuations in the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) field."

      falsifier: "Precise measurements of orbital paths show no deviation from GR predictions, even in regions where Pirouette theory predicts a significant Γ-gradient independent of the spacetime metric."

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, "Geodesic" always refers to a path maximizing *coherence* (an internal property of the system interacting with a field), not one minimizing path length in a curved spacetime. While the two concepts produce nearly identical results for standard gravitational orbits, they are mechanistically distinct. Pirouette's geodesic arises from a dynamic field (Γ), while GR's arises from a static geometric structure (the metric).
