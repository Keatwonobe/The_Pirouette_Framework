        *   **The Orbit (Replaces: Pi)**
            *   **Geometry:** A stable, closed loop. A cycle.
            *   **Description:** The resonance of rhythm, repetition, and equilibrium. It is the archetype of a system that maintains a stable identity by returning to its origin. The geometric invariant π is a natural property of this form.
            *   **Manifestations:** A planetary orbit, a circadian rhythm, a recurring habit, a stable economic cycle.

    The eternal return, a path that finds its own beginning. It is the stillness at the heart of motion, the cosmic rhythm that holds a system in a state of grace against the endless flow of time.
  law: |
    A system manifests The Orbit if and only if its state vector S(t) is periodic (S(t) = S(t + T) for some period T > 0) and corresponds to a local minimum on the coherence manifold, such that small perturbations decay and return the system to the cycle.
  philosophy: |
    The Orbit represents the fundamental principle of identity-preservation through repetition. It is the pattern by which systems achieve stability and predictability, forming the bedrock upon which more complex evolutionary patterns, like The Helix, can be built.
pirouette_definition: |
  One of the four Prime Resonances, representing the archetype of stable, cyclical behavior. An Orbit is a closed-loop Ki pattern characterized by rhythm, repetition, and dynamic equilibrium. Systems manifesting this resonance maintain their identity and coherence by periodically returning to a previous state, expending minimal energy to counteract temporal decay (Γ). It is the fundamental mode of persistence.
operational_definition:
  units: The period (T) is measured in seconds (s). The frequency (f) is measured in Hertz (Hz).

        outline: |
          1. Capture a time-series dataset of a key system state variable or observable over a duration of many expected cycles.
          2. Perform a Fourier Transform (or wavelet/similar analysis) on the time-series data to convert it to the frequency domain.
          3. Identify dominant, stable, and narrow peaks in the frequency spectrum. The presence of a strong, sharp peak at a fundamental frequency `f` is the primary signature of an Orbit.
        expected_signals: [A high-amplitude, narrow-band peak in the power spectrum at a fundamental frequency `f`, with potential integer harmonics (2f, 3f, ...).]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing a true, stable Orbit from a slowly drifting Helix (which manifests as a slowly shifting or broadening spectral peak). Mistaking quasi-periodic or chaotic behavior for a true stable cycle.]

    excerpt: |
      A healthy organization, for example, might have a signature of {Braid, Helix, Orbit}. Its behavior is a composite: a Braid of teams, each composed of individuals on a Helix of personal growth, all performing recurring Orbits of quarterly work cycles.

    - target: Limit Cycle Attractor
      domain: Math
      mapping_kind: mathematical
      justification: |
        A limit cycle is an isolated, periodic trajectory in the phase space of a dynamical system. State trajectories that begin near the limit cycle are attracted to it over time. This maps directly to The Orbit's nature as a stable, self-correcting, repeating pattern.

    - target: Stable Circular Orbit (Kepler Problem)
      domain: CM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        In classical mechanics, a stable circular orbit represents a minimum in the effective potential for a central force. This is a direct physical manifestation of a system trapped in a repeating, energy-minimizing path, analogous to The Orbit being a "valley" on the coherence manifold.

    - statement: "All systems exhibiting long-term stability without net growth or decay must possess a dominant Orbit component in their Resonant Signature."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "The discovery of a system that is stable indefinitely (d(Coherence)/dt ≈ 0) but whose temporal signature is purely aperiodic (e.g., chaotic, linear, or random) with no detectable periodic components after decomposition."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol Π (Pi) is also the mathematical constant ~3.14159. The context of Prime Resonances must distinguish the archetype from the geometric constant, although they are conceptually linked.]
  disambiguation: |
    The Orbit is a *dynamic process*, not a static geometric shape. It must be distinguished from a mere "circle" or "loop" by its nature as a stable attractor in a system's phase space, which is actively maintained against perturbations over time. It describes *behavior*, not just form.
