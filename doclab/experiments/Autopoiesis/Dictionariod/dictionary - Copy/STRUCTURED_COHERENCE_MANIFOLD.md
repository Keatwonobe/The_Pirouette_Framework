  art: |
    A labyrinth for a quantum particle, a question forged from crystal and silence. It is a sculpted landscape in time, whose very geometry dictates the most elegant way for a particle to exist.
  law: |
    A spatially and/or temporally varying field of Temporal Pressure (Γ) that imposes a coherence cost, `f(Γ)`, on any resonant system navigating it. The geometry of the manifold directly determines the difference in the Pirouette action integral (`ΔS_p`) for systems traversing different paths, manifesting as a measurable phase shift (`Δφ`).
  philosophy: |
    This concept reifies the abstract landscape of the Pirouette Lagrangian into a physical, laboratory-scale artifact. By building the manifold, we transform a foundational principle from a mathematical assertion into a tangible, falsifiable experimental component, proving that coherence is shaped by geometry at all scales.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Structured Coherence Manifold is a localized, engineered region of spacetime where the Temporal Pressure (Γ) is sculpted into a non-uniform, stable geometry. This geometry imposes a predictable coherence cost, `f(Γ)`, on the Pirouette Lagrangian of any traversing Ki resonance (e.g., a particle's wavefunction). The manifold acts as a topological filter, forcing the resonance to adopt quantized modes of Temporal Coherence (T_a) that represent the most efficient geodesics through its landscape.

  units: The manifold's effect is quantified by its coherence cost function, `f(Γ)`, which has units of energy (Joules).

      - name: Neutron Interferometry with Chiral Gratings
        outline: |
          A coherent neutron beam is split and passed through two arms of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Each arm contains a Γ-sculptor (e.g., a helical silicon grating) of opposite chirality, creating two distinct manifolds. The paths are recombined, and the resulting interference pattern's phase shift (`Δφ`) is measured. `Δφ` is proportional to the difference in action integrals (`ΔS_p`) along the two paths, directly quantifying the manifold's effect.

    excerpt: |
      In each arm of the interferometer, we place a micro-fabricated helical silicon grating. In the old language, this created a "spiral potential." In the new, time-first framework, this grating is a **Γ-sculptor** or **Topological Modulator**. It impresses a stable, chiral (screw-like) stress upon the local Temporal Pressure (Γ), forging a predictable, structured coherence manifold.
  - module: DOMA-074
    excerpt: |
      The most profound test is a dynamic one. The helical gratings are mechanically rotated at a known frequency (ωₙ). This action creates a rhythmic, oscillating pulse in the structure of the local Temporal Pressure—a "breathing" of the manifold. This modulation introduces a time-dependent term into the `f(Γ)` component of the Lagrangian.

      justification: |
        In conventional quantum mechanics, the effect of the helical grating is modeled as a potential energy term `V(x)` in the Hamiltonian. The phase shift `Δφ` is calculated from the integral of this potential. The Structured Coherence Manifold's cost `f(Γ)` plays an analogous role to `V(x)` in determining the action and resulting phase, mapping the time-first dynamics onto a familiar space-first potential model.

        The mapping to an external potential `V(x)` provides a direct operational bridge to standard matter-wave optics.

# Structured Coherence Manifold

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Structured Coherence Manifold is a localized, engineered region of spacetime where the Temporal Pressure (Γ) is sculpted into a non-uniform, stable geometry. This geometry imposes a predictable coherence cost, `f(Γ)`, on the Pirouette Lagrangian of any traversing Ki resonance (e.g., a particle's wavefunction). The manifold acts as a topological filter, forcing the resonance to adopt quantized modes of Temporal Coherence (T_a) that represent the most efficient geodesics through its landscape.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, a Structured Coherence Manifold is equivalent to a classical external potential field, `V(x)`, in the Hamiltonian of a quantum system. For instance, in neutron interferometry, the coherence cost `f(Γ)` imposed by a helical grating maps directly to the helical potential used in standard QM to calculate the accumulation of phase. This allows the Pirouette Framework's predictions to be tested using the established formalisms and experimental techniques of matter-wave optics (see Clark et al., Nature 525, 504–506, 2015).
