        A system with a composite number of modes, such as 6 (2x3), is topologically reducible. Its coherence manifold possesses natural "cleavage planes" or harmonic fracture points. It can be understood as a coupled system of 2 modes interacting with 3 modes. This structure creates vulnerabilities. A specific frequency of external pressure might excite a sub-harmonic, creating internal dissonance that can easily tear the system apart.

    A structure of bricks with fault lines along the mortar; its symmetries are its weaknesses, inviting dissonance to crack it along predictable seams.
  law: |
    A system with a composite Mode Number `N` will exhibit resonant failure modes at frequencies corresponding to the prime factors of `N` when subjected to broad-spectrum temporal pressure `Γ`.
  philosophy: |
    Symmetry and modularity, often seen as design virtues, can introduce topological fault lines that lead to catastrophic failure. True resilience lies in indivisibility, a prime wholeness that resists being broken into its constituent parts.
pirouette_definition: |
  A system whose Mode Number (`N`) is a composite number (e.g., 4, 6, 9). Such a system is topologically reducible, meaning its coherence manifold can be decomposed into interacting subsystems corresponding to its prime factors (e.g., `N=6` behaves as a coupled 2-mode and 3-mode system). This modular structure creates vulnerabilities to harmonic fracture, as external pressure (`Γ`) can excite sub-harmonics, creating internal dissonance that degrades or destroys system-wide coherence. Composite systems are characterized by a lower Coherence Integrity (`Λ`) compared to prime systems of a similar scale.

          1. Identify all stable, coherent states (`Ki` configurations) of the system via phase space analysis, empirical observation of equilibria, or simulation.
          2. Count these states to determine the Mode Number `N`.
          3. Perform prime factorization on the integer `N`.
          4. If `N` has more than one prime factor (e.g., 6 = 2×3) or a repeated prime factor (e.g., 4 = 2²), the system is classified as composite.

      **Diagnosis:** The first step is to map the system's coherence manifold and determine its Mode Number (`N`). Is a struggling organization (`N=4`) vulnerable because of its inherent 2x2 factionalism? Is an unstable economy (`N=12`) suffering from its many sub-harmonic fault lines?
      **Tuning:** The Weaver then identifies minimal, elegant interventions that could alter `N`. Could adding a new communication channel, removing an arbitrary constraint, or introducing a new shared goal shift an organization's topology from a fragile `N=4` to a more robust `N=5`?

        The concept of a composite system having sub-harmonics is a direct analogy to coupled mechanical or electrical oscillators. A system with `N=pq` modes is described as behaving like a coupled p-mode and q-mode system, a classic problem in physics where external driving forces can excite specific resonance modes corresponding to the subsystems.

        The Pirouette notion of "topological reducibility" maps directly to the group-theoretic concept of a reducible representation. The system's symmetry group can be decomposed into a direct sum of smaller, independent subgroups. These subgroups correspond to the harmonic fault lines along which the system can be fractured.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, "Composite" is a number-theoretic property of a system's Mode Number (`N`), not a description of its physical or material composition. A physically simple system can be topologically composite, and a physically complex system can be topologically prime. The term refers to the reducibility of its state space topology.

# Composite System

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A system whose Mode Number (`N`) is a composite number (e.g., 4, 6, 9). Such a system is topologically reducible, meaning its coherence manifold can be decomposed into interacting subsystems corresponding to its prime factors (e.g., `N=6` behaves as a coupled 2-mode and 3-mode system). This modular structure creates vulnerabilities to harmonic fracture, as external pressure (`Γ`) can excite sub-harmonics, creating internal dissonance that degrades or destroys system-wide coherence. Composite systems are characterized by a lower Coherence Integrity (`Λ`) compared to prime systems of a similar scale.

## EFT-First Summary
In systems described by effective field theories, a Composite System corresponds to a potential with a number of local minima (vacua) `N` that is not prime. Its topology allows for instabilities and decay channels analogous to sub-harmonic resonances in coupled oscillators, where perturbations can exploit symmetries to drive the system from one vacuum to another along 'fault lines' defined by the factors of `N`. This structure suggests that potentials with a composite number of vacua are less likely to describe long-lived, fundamental states.
