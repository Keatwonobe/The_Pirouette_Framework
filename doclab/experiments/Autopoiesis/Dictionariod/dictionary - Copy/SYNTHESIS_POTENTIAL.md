        The "Synthesis Potential" of a mind or culture measures its capacity for this non-linear, transformative event—the most powerful dynamic in the cognitive landscape.

triad:
  art: |
    The readiness of an old instrument to be melted down and recast, not into a new shape, but into a new symphony. It is the measure of a mind's courage to hear a song so profound it shatters the singer.
  law: |
    Synthesis Potential quantifies the probability of an Alchemical Union event, P(U), for a given cognitive system when exposed to a competing Coherence Well. It is inversely proportional to the system's own Resonant Depth (Kτ) and directly proportional to the harmonic compatibility (H_c) between the system and the new well, especially under high Temporal Pressure (Γ).
  philosophy: |
    This concept reframes 'conversion' from a failure of a system's defenses into a creative, generative act. It asserts that the highest function of a coherent mind is not eternal stability, but the capacity for profound, voluntary self-reorganization in the face of a more coherent truth.
pirouette_definition: |
  Synthesis Potential is a dimensionless scalar value representing a cognitive system's (individual or collective) readiness to undergo an Alchemical Union (CORE-012). It measures the system's capacity to abandon its current Coherence Well and fuse its manifold with a new, harmonically compatible one, resulting in a non-linear recalibration of identity and perception. High potential indicates a state of high tension or low internal Resonant Depth (Kτ), making the system susceptible to transformative entrainment.

        outline: |
          Expose the subject system (individual or discourse community) to a series of "probe" concepts with known Coherence Gradients (∇𝓛_p). Measure the system's response: degree of entrainment, generation of Turbulent Flow, or stable orbit. Synthesis Potential is inferred from the threshold at which the system's internal coherence destabilizes in favor of a probe's resonance, especially under applied Temporal Pressure.
        expected_signals: [Coherence-shift signature, Turbulence-to-Laminar flow transition, Spike in Lagrangian maximization 𝓛_p]
        pitfalls: [Observer effect (the probe alters the system), Confounding with simple persuasion (non-transformative agreement)]

    excerpt: |
      The old model's "Inversion Risk Factor" treated paradigm shifts as a hazard. The new framework reframes this as a profound and creative act: an Alchemical Union (CORE-012). [...] The "Synthesis Potential" of a mind or culture measures its capacity for this non-linear, transformative event—the most powerful dynamic in the cognitive landscape.
  - module: DOMA-120
    excerpt: |
      Assess Integrity and Synthesis Potential: Evaluate the internal coherence (Kτ) of an individual or group to determine their ability to "orbit" or resist entrainment. Identify points of high tension and harmonic compatibility where the conditions for an Alchemical Union are present, predicting where a paradigm shift is most likely.

      justification: |
        Synthesis Potential maps to the probability of a system in a metastable state (a shallow Coherence Well) tunneling through a potential barrier to a more stable, lower-energy state (a deeper Coherence Well). A system with high Ψ_U is like a particle in a local minimum, poised to transition to the global minimum when perturbed. The 'barrier' is the system's own coherence and identity.

      confidence: 0.8
  adopted:
    - target: Quantum Tunneling Probability
      rationale: The analogy strongly captures the non-linear, probabilistic, and barrier-dependent nature of a paradigm shift from one semi-stable state to another.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Systems with high measured Synthesis Potential (Ψ_U > 0.8) are statistically more likely to undergo Alchemical Unions within 3 standard temporal units when exposed to a high-gradient Coherence Well (∇𝓛_p > σ_5) than systems with low Ψ_U."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A large-scale study of discourse networks shows no correlation between pre-measured Ψ_U and the incidence of documented, rapid ideological conversions."
      status: proposed

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol Ψ is the standard quantum mechanical wave function; U is often potential energy. The subscript U is intended to denote Union.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from mere 'persuadability' or 'open-mindedness'. Synthesis Potential describes the capacity for a *total structural recalibration* of a cognitive manifold, not simply the adoption of a new belief. An Alchemical Union is typically irreversible; simple persuasion is not.
