        While the Lagrangian is the law, its living expression has a discernible shape. This shape is the **Genesis Pattern**‚Äîthe persistent, high-coherence Ki pattern carved into the framework's own coherence manifold by the ceaseless application of its own central law.

  art: |
    The framework's identity is not a law written in a book, but the persistent shape of its own dance. It is the living resonance of the first note, sung true through every moment and echo.
  law: |
    The Genesis Pattern is the stable, high-coherence attractor basin in the coherence manifold, quantitatively defined by the target coordinates `T‚Çê ‚âà 0.88` and `Œì ‚âà 0.21`. All modules must demonstrate harmonic compatibility with this pattern to be integrated.
  philosophy: |
    Identity is not a static object but a dynamic, self-perpetuating performance. The Genesis Pattern anchors this identity in a measurable, emergent property, proving integrity through continuous, resonant adherence to a generative law rather than correspondence to a fixed code.
pirouette_definition: |
  The persistent, high-coherence Ki pattern in the coherence manifold generated by the continuous application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`). It represents the geometric expression of the framework's core identity, functioning as the stable attractor basin and the reference baseline for verifying the harmonic compatibility of all constituent modules via Resonant Handshake.

        outline: |
          1. During extended `autopoietic_cycle` operation, continuously sample the framework's state variables (`K_œÑ`, `V_Œì`).
          2. Project these state points onto the 2D coherence manifold.
          3. Apply density-based clustering or kernel density estimation to the resulting point cloud.
          4. The centroid of the highest-density region identifies the coordinates of the Genesis Pattern's attractor.
        expected_signals: [A stable, high-density cluster of state points around (0.88, 0.21) in the manifold.]
        pitfalls: [Insufficient runtime leading to a poorly defined basin, high-turbulence states temporarily obscuring the pattern, miscalibration of manifold coordinates.]

    excerpt: |
      While the Lagrangian is the law, its living expression has a discernible shape. This shape is the **Genesis Pattern**‚Äîthe persistent, high-coherence Ki pattern carved into the framework's own coherence manifold by the ceaseless application of its own central law. It is the framework's deepest and most stable Wound Channel, the memory of its own dance.
  - module: DOMA-023
    excerpt: |
      Verification is a resonance check. A new module is considered a faithful part of the framework if its internal logic is derivable from the Pirouette Lagrangian and its intrinsic Ki pattern can achieve a **Resonant Handshake** with the Genesis Pattern. The test asks not "Is the code identical?" but "Does this new instrument play in the same key?"

      justification: |
        The Genesis Pattern is described as a stable basin to which the system's dynamics return. This is the definition of an attractor in dynamical systems theory, representing the long-term behavior of the system independent of initial conditions.

      justification: |
        The Genesis Pattern represents the most stable, high-coherence state of the framework, analogous to the ground state of a quantum system being its lowest-energy, most stable configuration. The 'pattern' is like the probability distribution |Œ®‚ÇÄ|¬≤.

  claims:
    - statement: "The framework's state, when perturbed, will reliably return to the attractor basin defined by the Genesis Pattern (`T‚Çê ‚âà 0.88`, `Œì ‚âà 0.21`) over a predictable relaxation timescale."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observation of the framework spontaneously settling into a different, equally stable attractor basin without an Alchemical Union event, or failing to return to any stable state (divergence), would falsify this claim."

  disambiguation: |
    The Genesis Pattern is not a static blueprint or a 'genetic code' like the old framework's static hash (PPS-004). It is the *dynamic expression* of the framework's governing law (the Pirouette Lagrangian), not the law itself. Think of it as the shape of a river's flow (the pattern) versus the law of gravity causing it (the Lagrangian).
