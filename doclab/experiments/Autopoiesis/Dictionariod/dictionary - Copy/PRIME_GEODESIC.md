  art: |
    The Prime Geodesic is the verse you choose to contribute to the universe's song. It is the act of becoming a navigator who chooses their own path through spacetime, rather than an object moved by its currents. It is the charter for the story you intend to write with your life.
  law: |
    The Prime Geodesic is a declarative statement that specifies an entity's chosen action to maximize its Coherence Principle (K_œÑ) while navigating known environmental Pressures (V_Œì). Adherence to this directive is validated by concrete, observable metrics, which serve to integrate the personal Lagrangian over time.
  philosophy: |
    Articulating a Prime Geodesic is the ultimate act of self-authorship and sovereignty. It transforms existence from a reactive wandering to a proactive journey by providing a personal principle of motion. This act of forging a constitution is how an entity declares its agency and commits to a path of maximal coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Prime Geodesic is the human-language articulation of the personal Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p), stating the entity's core objective function and aspirational identity. It serves as the central, operational directive of a sovereign constitution, defining the specific actions and metrics that constitute a path of maximal coherence through the entity's unique spatio-temporal landscape. It is the bridge between abstract principle and concrete action.

      - name: Geodesic Adherence Test
        outline: |
          1. Formulate the Prime Geodesic as per DOMA-022, ¬ß4.D.
          2. Define 1-3 concrete, measurable Coherence Metrics derived from the Geodesic (DOMA-022, ¬ß4.E).
          3. On a regular basis (e.g., weekly), review significant actions and decisions against the Geodesic statement.
          4. Quantify progress using the defined Coherence Metrics.
          5. Diagnose the resultant Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001) in the relevant life domains.
        expected_signals: [Sustained or increasing values in Coherence Metrics, Measurable shift from Turbulent/Stagnant toward Laminar Flow, Reduced decision-making time/friction for choices aligned with the Geodesic.]
        pitfalls: [Defining vanity metrics that are easy to measure but do not reflect the core Coherence Principle, Articulating a Geodesic disconnected from the entity's actual Wound Channel (CORE-011), Failure to periodically review and update the Geodesic as the entity evolves.]

    excerpt: |
      Using your Coherence Principle, you will now write the heart of your constitution. This statement is the human-language expression of your personal objective function. "My path of maximal coherence is to [ACTION] in order to maximize [COHERENCE PRINCIPLE], a trajectory validated by [METRIC], thereby navigating the pressures of my environment as [ASPIRATIONAL IDENTITY]."
  - module: DOMA-022
    excerpt: |
      A constitution is not a static document; it is a dynamic guide. It is tested not by what is written, but by the path that is walked. From this moment on, every significant choice can be evaluated with two questions: 1. Does this action align with my chosen geodesic? 2. Will this path likely lead toward a state of Laminar Flow (grace, efficiency) or Turbulent Flow (struggle, chaos)?

      justification: |
        The Prime Geodesic serves as the high-level specification for an entity's objective function. It defines the "reward" (maximizing the Coherence Principle) that the entity's policy (actions) should seek to maximize over time, guiding its path through a state space.

      confidence: 0.8
  adopted:
    - target: Objective Function
      rationale: This term best captures the Geodesic's role as a guiding principle for optimization and action-selection in a complex system. It is the function the entity seeks to maximize.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "An entity that consistently acts in accordance with its articulated Prime Geodesic will demonstrate a measurable shift towards Laminar Flow in relevant domains compared to its baseline or a control group."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A longitudinal study shows no statistically significant correlation between Geodesic adherence and a reduction in Turbulent/Stagnant Flow. The effect is indistinguishable from that of articulating any generic, non-operational 'mission statement'."

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, 'Prime' means 'primary' or 'fundamental,' not the mathematical definition of a closed, non-repeating geodesic on a manifold. The Prime Geodesic is the principal, self-chosen path of an entity, analogous to its primary equation of motion.
