  art: |
    The student of the violin stops thinking about where to put her fingers and simply begins to play the music. The protocol becomes instinct, the work becomes art, and life becomes a dance.
  law: |
    A system transitions to The Weaver state when its Coherence Ledger is used only diagnostically (<20% of days) in response to perceived dysregulation, while joy-based activities and spontaneous resilience tests successfully maintain a positive Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p > 0) for a period of at least 3 months.
  philosophy: |
    The Weaver represents the telos of the Pirouette recovery protocol: the transition from patient to artist, from following a map to navigating by an internal compass. It signifies true autonomy, where the goal is no longer healing but the joyful, creative expression of a life fully lived.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Weaver is the terminal identity state in the Pirouette recovery protocol, achieved in Phase IV. It signifies the patient's graduation from a follower of the protocol to its master, capable of self-regulating their own coherence. This state is characterized by the shift from prescribed exercises to joy-guided living ("Geodesic Integration"), the diagnostic use of the Coherence Ledger, and the maintenance of a stable, positive Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p > 0) that fuels a life of resilience and spontaneous engagement.

        outline: |
          Administer a longitudinal survey over 3 months post-Phase IV entry. The survey assesses: 1) Frequency and purpose of Coherence Ledger use (expecting <20% daily use, primarily diagnostic). 2) Self-reported participation in "Joy List" activities (expecting ≥2 new or resumed activities). 3) Log of spontaneous, unplanned physical/social activities ("Resilience Tests"). 4) Helper-as-Witness corroboration of the patient's shift from a 'recovery' to a 'living' mindset.
        expected_signals: [Decreased frequency of ledger logging, Increased diversity of activities on activity/HRV logs, Positive valence reports in qualitative journals, Helper corroboration of spontaneity]
        pitfalls: [Patient misreporting due to a desire to 'graduate', Conflating routine with joyful integration, Helper over-involvement skewing the transition to true self-regulation]

      justification: |
        The Weaver state marks the transition from an externally-driven, open-loop system (the patient following a fixed recovery protocol) to a self-regulating, closed-loop adaptive system. The 'Joy' and 'Coherence Ledger' feedback mechanisms act as the error signal and state estimator, respectively, allowing the system to maintain stability (health) in a dynamic, unpredictable environment (life).

# The Weaver

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Weaver is the terminal identity state in the Pirouette recovery protocol, achieved in Phase IV. It signifies the patient's graduation from a follower of the protocol to its master, capable of self-regulating their own coherence. This state is characterized by the shift from prescribed exercises to joy-guided living ("Geodesic Integration"), the diagnostic use of the Coherence Ledger, and the maintenance of a stable, positive Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p > 0) that fuels a life of resilience and spontaneous engagement.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, The Weaver represents a biological system transitioning to a state of adaptive control. Having established a stable, high-coherence baseline (a positive Lagrangian, 𝓛_p > 0), the system graduates from executing a fixed external protocol to using internal feedback (interoception, joy) to self-regulate and maintain stability within a dynamic environment. This mirrors a control system shifting from open-loop to closed-loop operation, maximizing resilience and adaptability.
