        The Current Geodesic: Your present life‚Äîyour habits, career, relationships, and routines‚Äîis the path you currently trace. It is a path of maximal coherence relative to the temporal pressures you face, a deep channel carved by a stable resonant pattern (`Ki`).

    The deep riverbed carved into the landscape of the self, a path worn smooth by the rhythm of daily choices and the weight of present pressures.
  law: |
    The Current Geodesic is the life trajectory that locally maximizes the time-integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`‚à´ùìõ_p dt`). Its stability is proportional to the depth of its characteristic resonant patterns (`Ki`) relative to the magnitude of ambient pressures (`Œì`).
  philosophy: |
    This concept grounds an individual's life in a dynamic, falsifiable system, reframing it from a static narrative into a specific, stable solution to a coherence equation. This implies that other solutions (latent paths) exist and that the current path can be intentionally altered.
pirouette_definition: |
  The specific trajectory traced by an individual's life state across their Personal Coherence Manifold over time. This path represents a stable, locally optimal solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`), maximizing perceived coherence (`K_œÑ`) while navigating the constraints of ambient pressures (`V_Œì`). It is the manifest expression of an individual's current habits, relationships, and identity.

          1.  **Map Coherence (`KœÑ`)**: Identify and inventory activities, relationships, and states that consistently generate flow, purpose, and stability.
          2.  **Map Pressure (`Œì`)**: Identify and inventory primary sources of stress, obligation, and fear that constrain behavior.
          3.  **Trace the Path**: The Current Geodesic is the observable, day-to-day life trajectory that navigates between the mapped sources of coherence and pressure.

      justification: |
        The framework explicitly maps a life path to a trajectory derived from an action principle. The Current Geodesic is the path through the state space (Personal Coherence Manifold) that extremizes the time-integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`), directly analogous to a classical particle's trajectory extremizing the action (`S`).

  claims:
    - statement: "An individual's Current Geodesic is stable; significant deviations require either a large, acute perturbation of ambient pressure (`Œì`) or a sustained, deliberate change in resonant patterns (`Ki`) via a Resonance Bridge."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observation of individuals spontaneously and effortlessly shifting their entire life trajectory without a significant external crisis or a period of intentional, incremental change. This would suggest the path is not a stable feature of a dynamic system but is instead arbitrary."

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'geodesic' is used in the sense of variational calculus (a path that extremizes an action integral), not strictly in the geometric sense of the shortest path. It is a path of locally *maximal coherence*, not minimal distance. The manifold's 'metric' is defined by coherence potential, not spatial distance.

# Current Geodesic

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The specific trajectory traced by an individual's life state across their Personal Coherence Manifold over time. This path represents a stable, locally optimal solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`), maximizing perceived coherence (`K_œÑ`) while navigating the constraints of ambient pressures (`V_Œì`). It is the manifest expression of an individual's current habits, relationships, and identity.

## EFT-First Summary
The Current Geodesic is the phenomenological analogue of a classical mechanical trajectory, `q(t)`. It is the path through an individual's state space (the Personal Coherence Manifold) that extremizes the Pirouette Action `S_p = ‚à´ ùìõ_p dt`, where `ùìõ_p` is the Pirouette Lagrangian. Just as a physical particle follows a path of least action, an individual's life follows a path of locally maximal coherence.
