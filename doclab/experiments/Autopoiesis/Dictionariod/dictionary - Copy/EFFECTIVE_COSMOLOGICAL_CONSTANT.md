    The faint, lingering hum of the time substrate's elasticity, stretched across cosmic scales. A vacuum echo of primordial stiffness, now pushing galaxies apart.
  law: |
    The dark energy equation of state is not constant but evolves with the cosmic scale factor `a` as `w(a) = -1 + (ε/3) ln a`, where `ε ~ 10⁻²` is the renormalization flow coefficient of Γ-stiffness.
  philosophy: |
    The force accelerating the cosmos and the principle giving mass to particles are not separate phenomena but two expressions of a single underlying reality: the elasticity of time itself. This completes the Pirouette framework's unification of microphysics and cosmology.
pirouette_definition: |
  The large-scale manifestation of residual Γ-stiffness energy density, `ρ_{Γ,res}`. In the low-coherence limit of cosmic evolution, fluctuations in the time substrate freeze out, leaving a uniform background potential energy. This residual energy acts as a positive vacuum pressure, driving cosmic acceleration. `Λ_eff` is not a fundamental constant but an emergent, dynamical quantity whose value is determined by the Γ-stiffness parameter and the mean-squared amplitude of residual fluctuations.

      When Γ-stiffness decays below its coherence threshold, its residual energy density manifests macroscopically as the cosmological constant... Thus Λ is not an arbitrary constant but the *vacuum echo* of the time substrate’s residual elasticity.

    excerpt: |
      At present epoch, `Γ_stiff ≈ 250 GeV` and `⟨(δΓ)²⟩¹ᐟ² ~ 10⁻²⁸ GeV`, yielding `Λ_eff¹ᐟ⁴ ~ 2 meV`, in excellent agreement with observed dark-energy density. The slow renormalization of `Γ_stiff` implies a mild time variation in H₀, providing a natural mitigation of the H₀ tension without exotic new fields.

      The Universe’s accelerated expansion is the macroscopic expression of the same invariant governing particle mass. In the cosmic limit, the mass-curvature invariant `M² = Γ_stiff² + R_τ/(8πG_eff)` implies `Λ_eff = R_τ/4`.

        Because `Λ_eff` is not strictly constant but undergoes slow, adiabatic decay due to the renormalization flow of `Γ_stiff`, it behaves like a dynamical dark energy model. This time-dependence (`w(a) ≠ -1`) is a key feature distinguishing it from a true cosmological constant and is invoked to mitigate the H₀ tension.

  disambiguation: |
    `Λ_eff` must be distinguished from the bare cosmological constant `Λ_bare` of quantum field theory, which is subject to the cosmological constant problem. In Pirouette, `Λ_eff` is a protected, low-energy emergent quantity whose small value is a direct consequence of the physics of Γ-stiffness, not a fine-tuned cancellation of vacuum energies.

# Effective Cosmological Constant

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The large-scale manifestation of residual Γ-stiffness energy density, `ρ_{Γ,res}`. In the low-coherence limit of cosmic evolution, fluctuations in the time substrate freeze out, leaving a uniform background potential energy. This residual energy acts as a positive vacuum pressure, driving cosmic acceleration. `Λ_eff` is not a fundamental constant but an emergent, dynamical quantity whose value is determined by the Γ-stiffness parameter and the mean-squared amplitude of residual fluctuations.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory and general relativity, the Effective Cosmological Constant (`Λ_eff`) corresponds to a form of dynamical dark energy, or quintessence. It is sourced by the residual potential energy of the Pirouette framework's time substrate (Γ-field), driving cosmic acceleration as observed. Unlike a true cosmological constant, `Λ_eff` evolves slowly with cosmic scale factor `a`, leading to a predictable drift in the equation of state parameter, `w(a) ≠ -1`, which offers a potential resolution to the Hubble tension.
