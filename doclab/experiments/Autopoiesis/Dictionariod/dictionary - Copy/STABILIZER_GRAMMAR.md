        Mathematics is **invented syntax** exploring many possible grammars.
        **Pirouette** selects the fragments whose invariants *stabilize* the temporal medium: these fragments behave like a **stabilizer grammar** for SR-0…6.
        We call this selective adhesion **stickiness**. It is *not* a theological claim that “all math exists”; it’s a **diagnostic** for which invented formalisms become **physically load-bearing**.

    Most math is a net. The sticky math is the mesh that the loom itself uses. We invent the nets; the loom keeps only what catches its threads with the least amount of mesh.
  law: |
    A mathematical domain is physically load-bearing (i.e., part of the stabilizer grammar) if and only if it passes the three-gate Pirouette-Compliance Test (PCT) and exhibits high Stickiness (Stk), a measurable score reflecting its compatibility with the spatialization map (Σ), its yield of conserved quantities, its descriptive compression power, and its predictive leverage.
  philosophy: |
    Mathematics is invented, not discovered in a Platonic realm. The universe, through an autopoietic feedback loop, selects for and stabilizes around those invented formalisms that are most efficient at describing and maintaining its own dynamics. This makes the stabilizer grammar a co-evolving feature of physical reality, not a pre-ordained truth.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Stabilizer grammar is the set of Pirouette-compliant mathematical domains whose invariants are selected for their ability to stabilize the temporal medium. A domain's inclusion is not axiomatic but is determined operationally by passing the Pirouette-Compliance Test (PCT) and earning a high Stickiness (`Stk`) score, which quantifies its utility in describing SR-0...6 dynamics with high compression and predictive leverage.

      default_range: "[0, 1]"
    - name: PCT
      meaning: Pirouette-Compliance Test. A three-gate (SR, Σ, Falsifiability) binary filter that a domain must pass to be considered load-bearing.
      dimensions: dimensionless (boolean pass/fail)
      default_range: "{Pass, Fail}"
    - name: RPA(D)

        outline: |
          1. For a candidate mathematical domain `D`, author a "domain card" detailing its Σ-compatibility, stabilizer yield, compression potential, and a falsifiable prediction.
          2. Benchmark `D` by re-deriving core results (e.g., GR hydrolimit, YM emergence) and measuring the change in minimum description length (MDL).
          3. Compute the `Stk` and `RPA` scores based on these benchmarks.
          4. A domain with `Stk >= 0.6` and `RPA` above the historical threshold `τ` is promoted to "pirouette" status and integrated into the grammar.
        expected_signals: [Reduced MDL for core derivations, generation of new falsifiable bounds for XXP tests, preservation of U(1)/SU(2)/SU(3) gauge structures without new constants.]
        pitfalls: [Overfitting to a narrow set of test derivations, "vibes-based" scoring of `Stk` components, failing to define a clear kill-switch for falsifiability tests.]

        The Stabilizer grammar is conceptually analogous to the Swampland program, which seeks to identify principles that distinguish effective field theories derivable from a consistent UV theory of quantum gravity from those that are not ("in the Swampland"). Both are selection criteria on the space of mathematical possibilities, though the Pirouette approach is operational and bottom-up (based on observed dynamics) rather than top-down (based on UV consistency).

        The emphasis on low description length (Compression Power) and avoiding ad-hoc constants ("knobs") in the Stabilizer grammar echoes the principle of technical naturalness, where parameters are protected from large quantum corrections by symmetries. Both serve as criteria for selecting "non-fine-tuned" or structurally robust theories.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, "stabilizer" refers to the function of stabilizing the physical medium (SR-0...6), not the mathematical object of a stabilizer subgroup (elements fixing a point) or a stabilizer code (operators defining a quantum code space). The term is chosen for its dynamic, functional implication over a static, structural one.

# Stabilizer grammar

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Stabilizer grammar is the set of Pirouette-compliant mathematical domains whose invariants are selected for their ability to stabilize the temporal medium. A domain's inclusion is not axiomatic but is determined operationally by passing the Pirouette-Compliance Test (PCT) and earning a high Stickiness (`Stk`) score, which quantifies its utility in describing SR-0...6 dynamics with high compression and predictive leverage.

## EFT-First Summary
From an effective field theorist's perspective, the Stabilizer grammar acts as a set of selection principles, analogous to the Swampland program, for identifying physically relevant mathematical structures (symmetries, geometries, algebras) from an infinite landscape of possibilities. Instead of UV-consistency arguments, it uses a bottom-up, measurable score (`Stk`) based on how well a mathematical structure compresses known dynamics and generates new, falsifiable predictions. This framework selects for theories that are not just consistent but "load-bearing" and structurally essential to the observed universe.
