  art: |
    The echoes of a team's soul made visible in play. They are the felt sense of harmony, grit, and foresight that separates a championship contender from a mere collection of athletes.
  law: |
    The three Signatures of Coherence—Cohesion, Resilience, and Morphogenesis—are the necessary and sufficient qualitative dimensions for predicting short-term performance shifts (Victor Tilt) in a competitive system. A system's observable coherence is quantifiable via these three independent axes.
  philosophy: |
    The Signatures bridge the gap between ineffable 'team chemistry' and empirical analysis. They provide a structured vocabulary to observe, measure, and ultimately engineer the dynamic qualities of a living system, transforming sports analysis from subjective commentary into a predictive science.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Signatures of Coherence are the three fundamental, observable patterns that characterize a system's functional integrity and dynamic potential. They are: 1) **Rhythmic Cohesion** (internal harmony and execution efficiency), 2) **Composure Under Pressure** (resilience to perturbation), and 3) **Strategic Adaptability** (morphogenesis, or the ability to dictate systemic patterns). These signatures are the direct inputs for instrumentation designed to measure a system's overall coherence (Kτ).

  units: Dimensionless (heuristic score)
  symbol_table:
    - name: Cohesion Score
      meaning: A measure of the efficiency and harmony of a team's execution.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: 1-10
    - name: Resilience Score
      meaning: A measure of a team's ability to absorb and recover from dissonant injections.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: 1-10
    - name: Morphogenesis Score
      meaning: A measure of a team's ability to control the game's resonant pattern and adapt its strategy.

      - name: Analyst Heuristic Scoring
        outline: |
          An analyst periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes of game time) observes a team's performance. The analyst consults the scoring rubrics for Cohesion, Resilience, and Morphogenesis and assigns a score from 1 (low) to 10 (high) for each signature based on the qualitative definitions. These three scores serve as the raw data input for the SFA-1.0 calculation engine.
        expected_signals: [Execution efficiency, unforced errors, player-to-player communication, body language after mistakes, tactical adjustments, tempo control.]
        pitfalls: [Analyst subjectivity and confirmation bias, overweighting singular dramatic events, failing to maintain a consistent baseline for "average" (a score of 5).]

    excerpt: |
      DOMA-SPORTS-001 provides the theoretical lens—the "ghost"—for viewing a sports match as a living system. This module provides the instrumentation—the "brute"—to make that ghost tangible. It is the engineering specification for the analyst, translating the qualitative "Signatures of Coherence" into a set of measurable parameters and a formal calculation engine. This is the bridge from prophecy to measurement.
  - module: INST-SPRT-001
    excerpt: |
      To implement the analysis, the analyst uses three conceptual instruments. Each instrument is a structured rubric for quantifying one of the three signatures of coherence on a simple scale... The Cohesion Gauge (Measures Rhythmic Cohesion)... The Resilience Meter (Measures Composure Under Pressure)... The Morphogenesis Index (Measures Strategic Adaptability).

      equation_hint: |
        System State ≈ f(Cohesion, Resilience, Morphogenesis)
      justification: |
        The three signatures can be mapped to core concepts in system dynamics. Cohesion acts like an order parameter or inverse entropy, measuring internal alignment. Resilience functions as a damping coefficient or inverse susceptibility, quantifying the system's response to external shocks. Morphogenesis acts as a control input, representing the system's ability to steer its own trajectory in state space.

  claims:
    - statement: "A team's scores on the three Signatures of Coherence are sufficient to predict near-term changes in win probability (Victor Tilt)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A model using only traditional box-score statistics (e.g., points, turnovers, field goal percentage) consistently outperforms a model based on the Signatures of Coherence in predicting in-game momentum swings and final outcomes across a large dataset of games."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'Overall Coherence' (Kτ), which is the calculated sum of the three signature scores. The Signatures are the raw, qualitative inputs; Overall Coherence is the first-level quantitative output. The term 'adaptability' is used as a convenient alias for Morphogenesis, but Morphogenesis more specifically implies the ability to shape the environment, not just react to it.
