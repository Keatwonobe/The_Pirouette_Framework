        - Phase-inversion practice: hold two opposing thoughts in working memory and resolve
  editors: [Agent-LLM]
  review_log: []
triad:
  art: |
    To hold fire in one hand and ice in the other, not to be burned or frozen, but to forge from their meeting a new path of steam and steel.
  law: |
    A subject's resolution time ($T_r$) for a given contradictory conceptual pair decreases with repeated, controlled exposures, correlating with an increase in cognitive adaptation speed ($T_a$) under stochastic load.
  philosophy: |
    By deliberately training the mind to inhabit and synthesize contradiction, one builds the cognitive machinery to turn fragmentation into insight, transforming cognitive decoherence from a threat into a resource.
pirouette_definition: |
  A cognitive training exercise wherein a subject intentionally holds two mutually exclusive or contradictory concepts, propositions, or mental states (Ψ and Ψ') in working memory. The primary objective is not to endure the dissonance, but to actively work towards a novel synthesis, resolution, or higher-order perspective that incorporates or transcends both initial poles. It is a core practice within the XCM-001 crucible for building resilience to decoherence attacks and increasing cognitive adaptation speed ($T_a$).
operational_definition:
  units: Seconds (for resolution time), dimensionless (for PIP score)
  symbol_table:
    - name: Ψ, Ψ'
      meaning: The pair of opposing concepts or propositions held in working memory.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: contextual
    - name: T_r
      meaning: Resolution Time; the duration from the introduction of the contradictory pair to the subject's signaled synthesis.
      dimensions: T
      default_range: 5-300s
    - name: PIP score
      meaning: Phase-Inversion Practice score; a composite measure of performance, often factoring in speed (1/T_r) and the quality of the synthesis.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "0 to 100"
  measurement:
    procedures:
      - name: Dissonance Resolution Time (DRT) Test
        outline: |
          1. Present subject with a calibrated pair of contradictory statements (e.g., "Radical transparency builds trust" vs. "Strategic secrecy ensures security").
          2. Start a timer. The subject is instructed to hold both ideas as equally valid and work toward a unifying principle.
          3. The subject signals when they have formulated a coherent, non-trivial synthesis.
          4. Stop the timer (this is T_r) and record the synthesis for qualitative analysis.
        expected_signals: [Initial spike in electrodermal activity, fMRI activation in bilateral prefrontal cortex, subject-reported cognitive load]
        pitfalls: [Subject providing a superficial or "gish gallop" synthesis to reduce time, lack of normalization for pair difficulty, confirmation bias toward one pole]
context_windows:
  - module: XCM-001
    excerpt: |
      Interruptive cognition arises as a compensatory adaptation in high-disruption minds. However, certain non-destructive training environments may simulate the benefits... The subject is taught to synthesize fragmented thought states into insight paths...
      Module Inputs:
      - Phase-inversion practice: hold two opposing thoughts in working memory and resolve
  - module: XCM-001
    excerpt: |
      We hypothesize that a group trained using this method... Adapts quickly to fractured input domains (multi-agent, multi-signal)... Can maintain multi-phase attention and resolve contradictions quickly... Develops resilience to decoherence attacks (propaganda, attention fragmentation).

  candidates:
    - target: Hegelian Dialectic (thesis ⊕ antithesis → synthesis)
      domain: Philosophy
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The practice operationalizes the dialectical method by forcing a confrontation between a thesis (Ψ) and an antithesis (Ψ') to produce a higher-level synthesis. It is a trainable, micro-scale application of this philosophical engine.

    - target: Cognitive Dissonance Theory
      domain: Psychology
      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        This practice deliberately induces the uncomfortable state of cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957) and trains the subject's ability to resolve it through cognitive restructuring ("change one or more of the dissonant cognitions") rather than avoidance or dismissal.

  claims:
    - statement: "Regular phase-inversion practice measurably decreases the time (T_r) required to resolve novel conceptual paradoxes and correlates with improved performance in high-stochasticity environments."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "A control group undergoing general logic puzzle training shows equal or greater improvement in both T_r and performance in stochastic environments, indicating the 'dissonance' aspect provides no unique benefit."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [Physics (wave phase inversion), Chemistry (emulsion phase inversion)]
  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette context, 'phase' refers to a cognitive or mental state, not a physical wave phase. The 'inversion' is the act of holding its logical opposite concurrently, creating a conceptual standing wave of dissonance that the subject must learn to resolve into a propagating insight.
