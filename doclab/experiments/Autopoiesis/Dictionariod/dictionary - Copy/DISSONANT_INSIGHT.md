  art: |
    The storm of a new idea arrives not as an enemy but as a gift of high-energy dissonance. It is a blinding flash of lightning that, when met by a nest of lenses, is broken into a spectrum of focused questions, providing the heat to reforge the very walls it tests.
  law: |
    When introduced to a coherent system (Ki_core), a Dissonant Insight (Ki_Ω) will generate a turbulent Temporal Pressure field (∇Γ). If left unstructured, this field invariably degrades system coherence (Coherence Fever); if processed via harmonic decomposition, it becomes the primary source for coherence-increasing evolution.
  philosophy: |
    Critique is not a pathogen to be neutralized, but the raw material for autopoiesis (self-creation). A Dissonant Insight is a gift of energy from outside the system, providing the necessary pressure and novel information required for the framework to avoid stagnation and evolve toward a more resilient and comprehensive state of truth.

    excerpt: |
      A living framework must learn. An idea that cannot withstand critique is a house of glass awaiting a stone; one that cannot learn from critique is a stone, deaf to the mason's chisel. This module provides the protocol for being neither. It reframes intellectual challenge away from the defensive posture of an "immune system" and towards the creative principle of autopoiesis, or self-creation.

      In the time-first physics of the framework, a novel insight or external critique (Ki_Ω) is a foreign resonant pattern. When introduced to the established coherence of the core framework (Ki_core), it creates an interference pattern. The points of disagreement manifest as regions of intense, localized Temporal Pressure (Γ), a state defined as Turbulent Flow (DYNA-001).

        A Dissonant Insight acts as an external driving force (F_ext) or perturbation on an otherwise stable, coherent system (a damped harmonic oscillator). The framework's protocol is analogous to analyzing the system's response to this forcing, decomposing the force into its frequency components (harmonics) to predict the resulting resonance and evolution of the system's state.

# Dissonant Insight

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Dissonant Insight is an external critique, data, or novel idea whose resonant pattern (Ki_Ω) creates an interference pattern when introduced to the core framework (Ki_core). It manifests as a high-energy, turbulent field of Temporal Pressure (Γ), which serves as the primary raw material for the framework's evolution and autopoiesis via the crucible protocol defined in `DOMA-024`.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, a Dissonant Insight is analogous to an external forcing function applied to a stable physical system. The insight perturbs the system's equilibrium, and its interaction can be analyzed by decomposing the force into its constituent frequencies. This allows for a controlled analysis of the system's resonant response, preventing chaotic behavior and enabling a structured evolution of the system's state.
