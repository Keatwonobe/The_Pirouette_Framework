  art: |
    The act of bearing witness, transforming the chaotic dance of a living system into the first, clear note of a song. It is the focused gaze that stills the world long enough to write down its name.
  law: |
    A Ritual is a defined, human-executed procedure that produces a time-ordered sequence of Chronoscript records with `source_type` set to `observation`, where each record's `lagrangian_state` is a direct measurement of a real-world system at the specified `timestamp`.
  philosophy: |
    To ground the entire framework in embodied reality. A Ritual asserts that human intuition and direct perception are not liabilities to be eliminated, but are primary, irreplaceable instruments for gathering data, ensuring that every simulation and analysis remains tethered to the world it claims to describe.
pirouette_definition: |
  A structured, human-led process of direct engagement with and measurement of a real-world system. Its sole, required output is a time-stream of `Chronoscript` records, where each record's `source_type` is marked as `observation`. The Ritual provides the empirical ground truth used to calibrate and validate corresponding `simulations`, forming the first step in the framework's autopoietic loop of inquiry.

        outline: |
          1. Define the system boundary and target `entity_id`.
          2. Establish a measurement protocol, instrumentation, and observation cadence.
          3. Execute the protocol, using human observers and/or instruments to capture the system's `lagrangian_state` at discrete intervals.
          4. Encode each measurement as a valid Chronoscript record with `source_type: observation`.
          5. Ensure the resulting time-stream is monotonic by `timestamp`.

  - module: DOMA-029
    excerpt: |
      The old framework created a schism between the language of the living world, captured through *rituals*, and the language of the machine, captured through *simulations*. This created an unnecessary and lossy translation step. The Weaver's Chronoscript protocol establishes a single, unified, and time-first data contract. Its purpose is to guarantee **Observational Parity**: the principle that human intuition and machine calculation are two equally valid instruments for exploring reality.
  - module: DOMA-029
    excerpt: |
      This protocol is not merely a static format; it is designed to fuel an autopoietic, self-improving cycle of inquiry. The unification of `observation` and `simulation` data streams enables a powerful feedback loop: 1. **Observation:** A human-led ritual is performed, generating a stream of `observation` records that capture the system's real-world behavior. 2. **Calibration:** This real-world data is used to seed, tune, and validate a computational model of the system.

      justification: |
        A Ritual is the Pirouette Framework's formalization of the act of scientific observation. It is a structured process for gathering empirical data from a real-world system, analogous to designing and running an experiment in classical physics to measure a system's state variables over time.

      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If a time-stream from a Ritual consistently fails to converge a corresponding simulation, or leads to simulations with no predictive power, the Ritual's design or the underlying model is flawed. The claim is falsified if no Ritual can be designed to ground a valid model."

  collisions: [The term 'ritual' has strong ceremonial and religious connotations in common usage.]
  disambiguation: |
    Within the Pirouette Framework, 'Ritual' does not imply religious or non-empirical ceremony. It refers specifically to a repeatable, rigorous, human-led data collection procedure. The name was chosen to emphasize the focused attention, discipline, and importance of the human observer in the loop, contrasting with purely automated data logging.

# Ritual

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A structured, human-led process of direct engagement with and measurement of a real-world system. Its sole, required output is a time-stream of `Chronoscript` records, where each record's `source_type` is marked as `observation`. The Ritual provides the empirical ground truth used to calibrate and validate corresponding `simulations`, forming the first step in the framework's autopoietic loop of inquiry.

## EFT-First Summary
In operational terms, a Ritual is the Pirouette equivalent of a classical physics experiment. It is the structured process by which an observer gathers empirical data (a time-series of state vectors) from a real-world system. This process provides the "ground truth" data essential for initializing and validating any theoretical model or computational simulation, directly linking the framework's abstractions to measurable reality.
