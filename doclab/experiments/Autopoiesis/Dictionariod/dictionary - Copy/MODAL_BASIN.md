        Modal Basins: Each stable mode is a peak or a high plateau on this manifold‚Äîa region where a specific `Ki` pattern represents a highly successful, coherent solution to the local Temporal Pressure (Œì). These are the system's preferred states of being, its regions of natural `Laminar Flow`.

  art: |
    A well-worn resting place in the landscape of possibility, a familiar song the system knows how to sing. It is a harbor of stability, a peak from which the world makes sense.
  law: |
    A Modal Basin is a local maximum on the Coherence Manifold. A system residing within a basin will resist perturbations up to a magnitude equivalent to the basin's Stability Depth (Œîùìõ_p) before initiating a state transition.
  philosophy: |
    Stability is not a prison, but a choice among many. Mapping a system's Modal Basins reveals the repertoire of its possible futures, turning passive observation into active co-creation by understanding the paths of least resistance to more coherent states.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Modal Basin is a local maximum (a peak or high plateau) on a system's Coherence Manifold, representing a specific, quasi-stable Ki resonance (Ki_m) that maximizes the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p). It is a preferred, self-sustaining operational mode characterized by high coherence and laminar flow. The geometry of the basin, specifically its Coherence Height (ùìõ_p,m) and Stability Depth (Œîùìõ_p), determines the state's quality and its resistance to perturbation.
operational_definition:
  units: A dimensionless region on the state space, defined by coordinates on the Coherence Manifold. The manifold's vertical axis has the units of the Pirouette Lagrangian.
  symbol_table:
    - name: Ki_m

      default_range: contextual
    - name: ùìõ_p,m
      meaning: Coherence Height. The value of the Pirouette Lagrangian at the basin's peak.

      default_range: contextual
    - name: Œîùìõ_p
      meaning: Stability Depth. The difference in ùìõ_p between the basin's peak and the lowest adjacent Transition Saddle.

        outline: |
          1.  **Identify Repertoire**: Use spectral analysis or clustering on system time-series data to identify distinct, recurring Ki resonance patterns (Ki_m).
          2.  **Measure Coherence**: For each identified mode, calculate its average Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) to determine its Coherence Height (ùìõ_p,m).
          3.  **Gauge Stability**: Analyze historical transition events or apply controlled perturbations. The minimum perturbation required to induce a state transition quantifies the Stability Depth (Œîùìõ_p).
          4.  **Map Pathways**: Correlate historical transitions with specific triggers (e.g., pressure shifts, dissonant injections) to map the Transition Saddles between basins.

        pitfalls: [Mistaking measurement noise for shallow/transient basins, insufficient data to resolve manifold geometry, confounding variables during perturbation tests.]

      Each stable mode is a peak or a high plateau on this manifold‚Äîa region where a specific `Ki` pattern represents a highly successful, coherent solution to the local Temporal Pressure (Œì). These are the system's preferred states of being, its regions of natural `Laminar Flow`.

    excerpt: |
      Persistence in a mode carves a **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) into the manifold, geometrically deepening its basin over time. This increases the `Stability Depth`, making the state a "habit" that is gravitationally harder to leave. It is the memory of the state.

      equation_hint: |
        Let x be a system state, f(x) be its dynamics (dx/dt). Let x* be a stable fixed point (f(x*)=0). The basin of attraction is the set B = {x‚ÇÄ | lim_{t‚Üí‚àû} œÜ(t, x‚ÇÄ) = x*}, where œÜ is the flow. A Modal Basin is the basin of attraction around a maximum of ùìõ_p.
      justification: |
        In dynamical systems theory, a basin of attraction is the set of initial conditions leading to a long-term behavior at a specific attractor (e.g., a stable fixed point). A Modal Basin is conceptually identical, defining the region of state space where the system's dynamics naturally converge to and remain at a specific coherent resonance (the attractor).

      domain: CM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        A Modal Basin is the direct analogue of a potential energy well, but on an "inverted" landscape. Whereas physical systems seek minima of potential energy, Pirouette systems seek maxima of coherence (ùìõ_p). Therefore, a stable state (a basin) is a peak in coherence, analogous to a valley in potential energy.

      confidence: 0.7
  adopted:
    - target: Basin of Attraction
      rationale: This is the most direct and mathematically consistent mapping from the field of dynamical systems, avoiding the inverted landscape analogy required for potential energy wells.

    - statement: "A system will remain in a given Modal Basin unless subjected to a single perturbation or cumulative stress exceeding its Stability Depth (Œîùìõ_p)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observation of a system spontaneously transitioning between deep, well-separated basins (high Œîùìõ_p) without any measurable external perturbation or internal fluctuation that accounts for the energy/coherence cost of the transition."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The term "basin" in physics and mathematics typically refers to a minimum or valley (e.g., river basin, potential well, basin of attraction around a minimum).]
  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a potential energy landscape where systems seek *minima* (valleys), the Coherence Manifold is an "inverted" landscape where systems seek to maximize coherence. Therefore, a Modal Basin is a stable *peak* or high plateau. It is a basin of attraction surrounding a local maximum of the Pirouette Lagrangian.
