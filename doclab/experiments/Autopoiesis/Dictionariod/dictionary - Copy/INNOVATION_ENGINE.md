  art: |
    A candle in a hurricane. It is the collective human genius that finds pathways through the impossible, a fragile light wholly dependent on the shelter of a stable world to burn.
  law: |
    The growth rate of the Innovation Engine's capacity (dΓ/dt) is proportional to total civilizational power, but its own coherence (T_a) and capacity (Γ) collapse when the aggregate stability of supporting actors falls below a critical threshold. It cannot out-innovate systemic collapse; it is a casualty of it.
  philosophy: |
    The Innovation Engine refutes technological solutionism. It operationalizes the principle that problem-solving capacity is not an external force but an emergent property of a coherent society, making innovation a lagging indicator of societal health, not its driver.
pirouette_definition: |
  An actor in the Pirouette Engine representing the collective technological and socio-organizational problem-solving capacity of a civilization. The Innovation Engine is modeled as a non-political entity whose capacity (Γ) grows in proportion to total civilizational activity, but whose own coherence (T_a) is highly fragile and dependent on the stability of other actors. Its primary function in simulations is to provide a potential counter-balancing force to systemic decay (e.g., Biosphere collapse), but it is itself vulnerable to that same decay.

        outline: |
          1. Construct a weighted index of global R&D spending, quality-adjusted patent filings, scientific publication rates, and improvements in key efficiency metrics (e.g., EROEI for energy, computational efficiency per watt).
          2. Normalize this index against a baseline year to track growth (approximating Γ).
          3. The stability of this growth rate, its diversification across sectors, and the robustness of funding/collaboration networks serve as a proxy for T_a.
        expected_signals: [Time series data on patent filings, research budgets, energy efficiency trends.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking patent quantity for quality; overlooking non-capitalized or non-Western innovation; metrics can be lagging indicators of true breakthroughs.]

    excerpt: |
      The lesson is that technology cannot be developed in a societal vacuum; it is a product of a stable civilization, the very thing the crisis erodes. The Stagnation of Innovation marks the end of the dream that we can invent our way out of the crisis without fundamental societal change.

        TFP in macroeconomic growth models represents the portion of output growth not explained by the amount of labor and capital used. It is interpreted as the contribution of technological progress and efficiency, analogous to the Innovation Engine's role as a source of novel problem-solving capacity (Γ).

  adopted:
    - target: Total Factor Productivity (TFP)
      rationale: TFP is the most widely accepted and measured proxy for macroeconomic technological progress, making it a robust and operational analogue for the Innovation Engine's productive capacity.

    The Innovation Engine is an *actor* with its own state variables (Γ, T_a, Φ), not the abstract concept of innovation. Its Gladiator Force (Γ) represents the *capacity* to innovate, distinct from the geopolitical power (Γ) of a nation-state.

# Innovation Engine

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An actor in the Pirouette Engine representing the collective technological and socio-organizational problem-solving capacity of a civilization. The Innovation Engine is modeled as a non-political entity whose capacity (Γ) grows in proportion to total civilizational activity, but whose own coherence (T_a) is highly fragile and dependent on the stability of other actors. Its primary function in simulations is to provide a potential counter-balancing force to systemic decay (e.g., Biosphere collapse), but it is itself vulnerable to that same decay.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Innovation Engine maps to the concept of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) from macroeconomics. It represents the component of civilizational output growth driven by technological and efficiency gains, rather than raw inputs of capital or labor. The Pirouette model extends this by positing that TFP growth is not exogenous, but is instead critically dependent on the overall coherence and stability of the socioeconomic system.
