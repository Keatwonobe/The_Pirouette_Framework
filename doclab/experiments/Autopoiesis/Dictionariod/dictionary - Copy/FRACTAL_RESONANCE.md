  art: |
    The universe sings in a key of coherence, a melody played on many instruments—a pulsar, a protein, a planet. Fractal Resonance is the name of that recurring song, the universe's native grammar.
  law: |
    Any system governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian will, under sustained Temporal Pressure, preferentially occupy a discrete set of self-similar, stable states (Ki modes). These modes correspond to local maxima of the coherence function and are observable as power concentrations in the system's dynamic spectrum.
  philosophy: |
    Fractal Resonance proves that coherence is not a human preference but a physical law. It transforms consilience from a methodological principle into a core feature of reality, showing that the most stable patterns—from life to thought—are discovered, not invented.
pirouette_definition: |
  Fractal Resonance refers to the discrete, recurring, and self-similar patterns that manifest as stable, quantized solutions to the Pirouette Lagrangian across all scales. These patterns, denoted as Ki modes, represent the specific configurations or dynamic states that maximize a system's internal coherence (K_τ) relative to external Temporal Pressure (V_Γ). They are the observable 'geodesics' on the manifold of coherence, appearing as harmonic power concentrations in systems ranging from the geophysical to the semantic.

          1. Collect time-series or structural data from a system under non-trivial Temporal Pressure (V_Γ).
          2. Apply spectral analysis (e.g., Wavelet Transform, Fourier analysis) or fractal dimension analysis.
          3. Identify discrete, persistent power concentrations or clustering in the resulting spectrum/distribution.
          4. Compare the locations of these peaks/clusters against the predicted Ki harmonic series for the system's class.

    excerpt: |
      The recurring, resonant patterns we observe are the stable, quantized solutions to this equation—the specific notes a system can hold to remain stable against the chaos. Each piece of evidence is a case study of a system tracing its natural path—its geodesic—on the manifold of coherence.

    excerpt: |
      Wavelet analysis of major earthquakes reveals that the Earth's crust does not fracture chaotically. It "rings like a bell," releasing energy along a clear, resonant pathway. These power concentrations precisely match the stable harmonic solutions predicted by the Lagrangian, representing the most efficient modes for dissipating immense temporal pressure.

    excerpt: |
      An analysis of over one million proteins reveals their fractal dimensions are not randomly distributed, but cluster around the framework's predicted modes of maximal stability. Evolution has repeatedly and independently discovered the same set of maximally coherent geometric solutions to sustain the dance of life.

formal_mappings:
  candidates:
    - target: Eigenmodes / Normal Modes
      domain: CM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Like the normal modes of a vibrating string or membrane, Ki modes represent the stable, standing-wave solutions for a system's dynamics. They are the natural frequencies at which the system can oscillate without dissipating energy into chaotic motion.
      confidence: 0.8
    - target: Quantized energy levels
      domain: QM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The discrete nature of Ki modes mirrors the quantization of energy levels in atomic systems. Both represent stable, allowed states separated by 'forbidden' zones, arising from boundary conditions imposed on a wave-like equation.
      confidence: 0.7
    - target: Attractors in chaos theory
      domain: Math
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Ki modes can be modeled as attractors in the state space of a dynamical system. They represent the basins of stability toward which system trajectories converge over time, revealing an underlying fractal geometry.
      confidence: 0.6
  adopted:
    - target: Eigenmodes / Normal Modes
      rationale: This mapping is the most direct and operational. The measurement procedures for Fractal Resonance (e.g., spectral analysis to find peaks) are identical to those used to find the eigenmodes of a physical system.
      confidence: 0.8

  claims:
    - statement: "Systems across all scales, when analyzed spectrally or distributionally, will exhibit power concentrations or data clustering at harmonic ratios predicted by the Pirouette Lagrangian, and not a random or uniform distribution."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A comprehensive survey of diverse systems (e.g., geological, biological, economic) fails to show statistically significant clustering at the predicted Ki values. Instead, power spectra are found to be random, scale-free, or clustered at values entirely uncorrelated with the framework's predictions."

# Fractal Resonance

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Fractal Resonance refers to the discrete, recurring, and self-similar patterns that manifest as stable, quantized solutions to the Pirouette Lagrangian across all scales. These patterns, denoted as Ki modes, represent the specific configurations or dynamic states that maximize a system's internal coherence (K_τ) relative to external Temporal Pressure (V_Γ). They are the observable 'geodesics' on the manifold of coherence, appearing as harmonic power concentrations in systems ranging from the geophysical to the semantic.

## EFT-First Summary
Fractal Resonance describes the set of stable eigenmodes or normal modes (Ki) that emerge in any system optimized by the Pirouette Lagrangian. Analogous to the harmonic modes of a vibrating string, these are discrete, self-similar patterns of maximal coherence that a system preferentially occupies under external pressure. Their observation across disparate physical domains (see DOMA-093) provides strong consilient evidence for the Lagrangian's universality.
