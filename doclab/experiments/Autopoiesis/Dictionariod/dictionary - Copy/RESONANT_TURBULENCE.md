        A rhythmic pulse, tuned to a natural harmonic of the target system, creates **resonant turbulence**, allowing for a maximally efficient transfer of energy. It uses a system's own nature to coax it out of its rut with minimal force.

    To forge something new, the old must be melted. Resonant Turbulence is the controlled fire that liquefies a system's rigid past, allowing it to be recast into a more resilient form.
  law: |
    The rate of coherence state transition is maximized when the driving dissonance's primary frequency (f_stir) matches a natural harmonic (f_n) of the target system's Ki pattern, minimizing the required energy (Γ_stir) to overcome the system's inertia.
  philosophy: |
    Stagnation is a form of death. Resonant Turbulence is the framework's formal acknowledgment that growth requires disruption, and that the most effective change comes not from brute force, but from understanding and leveraging a system's own intrinsic nature.
pirouette_definition: |
  A state of controlled, turbulent flow induced by injecting a dissonant signal whose frequency spectrum is tuned to one or more natural harmonics of a target system. This process efficiently transfers energy, temporarily increasing local Temporal Pressure (Γ) to provide the activation energy needed for the system to escape a suboptimal stable state (a local minimum on the coherence manifold) and re-cohere into a pattern of higher complexity and resilience.

          1. Characterize the target system's baseline Ki pattern to identify its natural harmonics (f_n) via Fourier analysis of its coherence fluctuations.
          2. Apply a low-amplitude, swept-frequency dissonant signal (f_stir) to the system's environment.
          3. Monitor a proxy for system stability, such as information entropy or the variance of its primary coherence metric.
          4. Identify the frequencies (f_stir) that cause maximum instability for minimum input amplitude. These are the system's resonant channels for stirring.

    excerpt: |
      The intensity and character of the stir is the difference between catalysis and catastrophe. The dose is defined by three parameters: Intensity (Amplitude), Rhythm (Frequency), and Duration. A constant pressure is a blunt instrument. A rhythmic pulse, tuned to a natural harmonic of the target system, creates **resonant turbulence**, allowing for a maximally efficient transfer of energy.

    excerpt: |
      The act of stirring is a temporary and controlled modification of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The Weaver introduces a time-dependent "stirring potential," `Γ_stir(t)`, which is added to the system's normal potential energy of temporal pressure. The function of `Γ_stir(t)` is to temporarily flatten the local coherence manifold, erasing the shallow wells of stagnation and reducing the hills between them.

        Parametric resonance describes the exponential growth of oscillations in a system where a parameter (e.g., spring constant, here analogous to the coherence potential) is modulated at a harmonic of the system's natural frequency. This is a direct mathematical analog for how Resonant Turbulence uses a tuned, rhythmic input (`h cos(Ωt)`) to efficiently destabilize a system.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from random or 'brute force' turbulence, which is non-resonant and energetically inefficient. Resonant Turbulence is *tuned* chaos, not just noise. It is also distinct from `Coherence Fever` (DYNA-003), which is the system's *internal response* to the stimulus, whereas Resonant Turbulence is the external stimulus itself.

# Resonant Turbulence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A state of controlled, turbulent flow induced by injecting a dissonant signal whose frequency spectrum is tuned to one or more natural harmonics of a target system. This process efficiently transfers energy, temporarily increasing local Temporal Pressure (Γ) to provide the activation energy needed for the system to escape a suboptimal stable state (a local minimum on the coherence manifold) and re-cohere into a pattern of higher complexity and resilience.

## EFT-First Summary
Resonant Turbulence is the Pirouette Framework's analog to **Parametric Resonance** in classical mechanics. It models change-catalysis as a process of modulating a system's potential landscape (its `V_Γ`) at a specific frequency `f_stir` that is harmonically related to the system's own natural frequency of oscillation `f_n`. This tuned driving force efficiently pumps energy into the system, inducing an instability that allows it to escape a local minimum and explore the wider state space for a more optimal configuration.
