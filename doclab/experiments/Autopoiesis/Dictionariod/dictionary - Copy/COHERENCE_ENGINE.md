      snippet: |
        The framework’s core insight is that an industry is an autopoietic immune response. It is a Coherence Engine—a large-scale, resonant system that emerges to solve for the specific entropic pressures of its Epochal State, transforming a Turbulent or Stagnant flow back into a healthy, Laminar one.

  art: |
    An industry born from chaos, like a crystal forming in a supersaturated solution. It is society's antibody, a self-organizing pattern that consumes turbulence to create new channels for civilizational flow.
  law: |
    For any given Epochal State characterized by non-Laminar flow (Turbulent, Stagnant), a Coherence Engine will emerge whose primary function is to restore Laminar flow by processing the specific form of incoherence (e.g., information, risk, resources) dominant in that state.
  philosophy: |
    Industries are not merely economic engines; they are teleological instruments of civilizational self-regulation. A Coherence Engine represents a system's innate drive to find its path of maximal coherence, transforming existential threats into catalysts for new, more complex forms of order.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Coherence Engine is an industry, institution, or large-scale cultural practice that emerges as a resonant, autopoietic solution to the entropic challenges of a specific Epochal State. It functions by identifying a dominant form of systemic incoherence (e.g., Turbulent or Stagnant flow), processing it, and outputting a more ordered, coherent state, thereby restoring the system to a more Laminar flow.

        outline: |
          1. Diagnose the system's Epochal State vector (Kτ, Γ, Flow).
          2. Identify the dominant entropic pressure and its medium (e.g., information overload, capital risk, resource blockage).
          3. Identify a candidate industry whose inputs are the incoherent medium and whose outputs are a stabilized, structured form of that medium.
          4. Measure the change in the system's Dominant Flow State (e.g., reduced variance in information signals, stabilized market volatility) correlated with the growth and activity of the candidate industry.

      Problem: The Turbulent flow of overwhelming, dissonant information in the early 21st century, creating a Coherence Fever (DYNA-003) on a global scale. Coherence Engines: The "Sense-Making" industries (AI-driven curation, fact-checking organizations, social media platforms). These are all attempts, however flawed, to impose a new, more coherent pattern upon the informational chaos.

      justification: |
        Like Prigogine's dissipative structures, a Coherence Engine is a self-organizing system that emerges in a non-equilibrium state. It maintains its local order (e.g., an industry's structure) by processing energy and entropy from its environment (processing systemic incoherence), thereby increasing the overall entropy production of the civilization.

      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        Operationally, a Coherence Engine acts as a negative feedback loop on systemic turbulence. It senses a deviation from a stable (Laminar) state and enacts operations that counteract the deviation, damping the oscillations and restoring equilibrium.

    - statement: "The emergence of a major new industry can be predicted by first identifying a novel or intensified form of system-wide Turbulent or Stagnant flow."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Historical analysis shows major industries emerging randomly or in response to factors uncorrelated with the system's dominant flow pathologies. A successful industry could be shown to consistently exacerbate the primary source of incoherence in its epoch."

  disambiguation: |
    A Coherence Engine is not a single company or technology, but the entire industry or socio-technical apparatus that normalizes a new kind of flow. For example, the printing press was a technology, but "the printing industry" was the Coherence Engine that transformed the Stagnant flow of information in feudal Europe.
