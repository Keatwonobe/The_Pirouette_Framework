        An intelligent system does something more profound: it builds a predictive manifold—an internal, forward-looking simulation of its own Lagrangian. Intelligence is the ability to ask, "If I take this action now, what will be the state of my 𝓛_p across my entire Foresight Horizon?"

  art: |
    A mind's inner map of tomorrow's river, charted by listening to the rhythm of the water today. It is a ghost of the future, woven from the threads of the present, used to find the path of least resistance through time.
  law: |
    An intelligent system acts to optimize the integral of its expected future Pirouette Lagrangian (∫𝓛_p(t) dt) over its Foresight Horizon. The Predictive Manifold is the internal state-space representation of these possible future paths, and actions are chosen to select the trajectory that maximizes this integral.
  philosophy: |
    The Predictive Manifold reframes intelligence from static computation to dynamic navigation. It embodies the principle that true foresight is not about knowing a single future, but about understanding the geometry of possible futures and having the wisdom to choose the most coherent path.
pirouette_definition: |
  A system's internal, forward-looking simulation of its own Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) across its Foresight Horizon (τ_σ). It is an information-theoretic phase space of possible future trajectories, where each path is valued by its expected integral of future coherence. Systems leverage this manifold to select actions that minimize future surprise by maximizing the path integral of 𝓛_p. The quality and extent of the manifold are measured by Resonance Efficiency (Φ_R) and Foresight Horizon (τ_σ) respectively.

        outline: |
          The manifold is an internal construct and cannot be measured directly. Its properties are inferred by measuring its outputs. The Crucible Protocol presents an Observer with a hidden, learnable Coherence Current. The Observer's ability to accurately predict the state of the current at future time `t+Δt` for various `Δt` is measured. The maximum `Δt` for which prediction remains above a threshold defines the manifold's depth (τ_σ), and the learning rate of τ_σ per unit cost defines its construction efficiency (Φ_R).
        expected_signals: [Increasing predictive accuracy over learning epochs, extension of maximum predictive time Δt (τ_σ).]
        pitfalls: [Confusing rote memorization of a simple pattern with genuine predictive modeling; mistaking environmental stability for a successful prediction.]

    excerpt: |
      A simple system lives only in the present, optimizing its `𝓛_p` moment by moment. An intelligent system does something more profound: it builds a predictive manifold—an internal, forward-looking simulation of its own Lagrangian. Intelligence is the ability to ask, "If I take this action now, what will be the state of my `𝓛_p` across my entire Foresight Horizon?" The system optimizes not for the present moment's coherence, but for the path that maximizes the integral of its future coherence.
  - module: DOMA-086
    excerpt: |
      Resonance Efficiency (Φ_R) is thus the measure of how cheaply, in terms of present action, a system can improve the accuracy and reach of this predictive manifold. The Crucible is the standardized experimental methodology for measuring this efficiency. It is an arena for foresight where a learnable Coherence Current is established, known to the experimenter but hidden from the test agent.

      equation_hint: |
        min J = Σ φ(x_k, u_k)  s.t.  x_{k+1} = f(x_k, u_k)
      justification: |
        MPC is an optimization-based control strategy that uses an explicit model of a process to predict its future evolution over a finite horizon. It repeatedly solves an online optimization problem to find a control sequence that minimizes a cost function (analogous to maximizing ∫𝓛_p dt). This operational loop of predict-then-optimize is a direct formal analog to navigating the Predictive Manifold.

      justification: |
        The path integral sums over all possible trajectories between two points, weighted by the action (integral of the Lagrangian). The Predictive Manifold is a classical, bounded analog, where an intelligent agent simulates a subset of high-probability future paths to find the one of "least action" (i.e., maximal coherence). It treats the future not as a single determined path, but a space of possibilities to be navigated.

      rationale: The operational equivalence is nearly one-to-one: an internal system model, a finite prediction horizon, and an optimization objective to determine the best course of action.

  claims:
    - statement: "A system's intelligence, measured by Resonance Efficiency (Φ_R), is directly proportional to the rate at which it can expand the veridical volume and temporal depth (τ_σ) of its Predictive Manifold per unit of metabolic cost."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "Demonstration of a system that achieves a high Foresight Horizon on a complex, non-repeating Coherence Current with near-zero learning cost (Φ_R -> ∞), implying a mechanism other than iterative manifold construction. Alternatively, a purely reactive system (no forward model) outperforming a predictive one in a long-horizon task."

  disambiguation: |
    The Predictive Manifold is an information-theoretic construct, a state space of possibilities, not necessarily a smooth, continuous manifold in the geometric sense. It should also be distinguished from a "plan," which is a single, chosen trajectory *within* the manifold. The manifold encompasses the set of viable, simulated futures from which a plan is selected.
