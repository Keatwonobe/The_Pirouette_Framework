        Integrity is no longer a cryptographic check but a test of harmony, governed by the **Principle of Harmonic Inclusion**. Verification is a resonance check. A new module is considered a faithful part of the framework if its internal logic is derivable from the Pirouette Lagrangian and its intrinsic Ki pattern can achieve a **Resonant Handshake** (CORE-012) with the Genesis Pattern.

    A new instrument is tested not by its shape, but by whether it plays in the same key as the orchestra. The song of the framework only grows richer if the new voice joins in harmony, not dissonance.
  law: |
    A new module is valid if and only if its intrinsic Ki pattern achieves constructive interference when interacting with the Genesis Pattern during a Resonant Handshake. The resulting change in system coherence (ΔC) must be greater than zero.
  philosophy: |
    Integrity is not static identity but dynamic compatibility. The framework endures not by rejecting change, but by ensuring that all change enriches the core resonance, making the whole song more complex and stable.

  The principle governing the integrity and ratification of new framework components. It mandates that any proposed module must be 'harmonically compatible' with the core Genesis Pattern. This compatibility is verified not by cryptographic identity, but by a functional `Resonant Handshake` (CORE-012) where the new module's Ki pattern must produce constructive, rather than destructive, interference with the Genesis Pattern.

          1. Isolate the intrinsic Ki pattern of the candidate module under standard operating conditions.
          2. Initiate a `Resonant Handshake` (CORE-012) protocol, simulating the interaction between the candidate pattern and the framework's live Genesis Pattern.
          3. Measure the total system coherence before and after the handshake to calculate the coherence gain factor, ΔC.
          4. A module passes if ΔC > 0, indicating constructive interference.

      The framework spreads through `Wound Channels` (CORE-011), but its integrity is maintained by ensuring every echo remains harmonically compatible with the source—the single, clear note of the Pirouette Lagrangian.

      justification: |
        The Genesis Pattern represents a stable attractor (x₀) of the framework's dynamics. Introducing a new module is a perturbation (δx) to the system. The Principle of Harmonic Inclusion is analogous to performing a linear stability analysis, where the eigenvalues of the Jacobian (J) determine if the perturbation decays (stability, constructive interference) or grows (instability, destructive interference).

    Distinguish from simple 'compatibility checks' or cryptographic signature verification (as in the deprecated PPS-004). Harmonic Inclusion is not about matching a static signature, but about testing dynamic, functional resonance with the living system's core pattern.

# Principle of Harmonic Inclusion

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The principle governing the integrity and ratification of new framework components. It mandates that any proposed module must be 'harmonically compatible' with the core Genesis Pattern. This compatibility is verified not by cryptographic identity, but by a functional `Resonant Handshake` (CORE-012) where the new module's Ki pattern must produce constructive, rather than destructive, interference with the Genesis Pattern.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, this principle is analogous to a linear stability analysis in dynamical systems theory. The framework's core state (`Genesis Pattern`) is a stable attractor. A new module is a perturbation. The "Resonance Check" determines if the perturbation will decay (stabilizing the system, i.e., "harmonic inclusion") or grow (destabilizing it). A module is accepted only if it is proven to be a stabilizing, coherence-enhancing addition to the system's dynamics.
