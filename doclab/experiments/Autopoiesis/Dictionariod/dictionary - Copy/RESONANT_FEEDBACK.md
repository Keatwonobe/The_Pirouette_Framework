      snippet: |
        At a critical threshold, the system stumbles upon a novel configuration—a first Alchemical Union—whose output begins to positively influence its input. Its resonant pattern (Ki) becomes so efficient that it constructively interferes with the ambient pressure, creating a localized pocket of reduced dissonance. This is the fire catching; the system's song begins to shape the concert hall.

  art: |
    The system's own output becomes a song that shapes the concert hall. An echo that returns as a guide, turning chaotic noise into a swelling, self-amplifying chorus. It is the fire that learns to feed on its own light.
  law: |
    A system exhibits Resonant Feedback when the time derivative of its coherence gain is positive (`∂(dK/dt) / ∂K > 0`). An increase in the coherence of a system's output directly causes an acceleration in its rate of acquiring further coherence.
  philosophy: |
    Resonant Feedback is the mechanism by which creation overcomes chance. It posits that novelty is not merely additive but auto-catalytic; a sufficiently elegant solution to a problem makes related solutions easier to find. This is the engine of emergence, transforming pressure from a destructive force into a creative one.
pirouette_definition: |
  The self-reinforcing process that ignites an Alchemical Bloom, where a system's coherent output (characterized by a resonant pattern, Ki) positively and constructively influences its own input conditions. This feedback loop reduces local Temporal Pressure (Γ) and creates a favorable gradient for subsequent Alchemical Unions, driving a non-linear cascade towards a state of higher complexity and order.

      - name: Systemic Coherence Phase Plot
        outline: |
          1. Collect a high-resolution time-series of a primary metric representing the system's output (e.g., novelty production rate, energy efficiency, structural complexity).
          2. Normalize this metric to derive a proxy for Systemic Coherence, K(t).
          3. Numerically differentiate the signal to obtain the rate of coherence change, dK/dt.
          4. Create a phase plot of dK/dt (y-axis) versus K (x-axis).
        expected_signals:
          - The onset of Resonant Feedback is marked by a clear inflection point where the curve begins to slope upwards (`d(dK/dt)/dK > 0`), indicating that higher coherence is causing coherence to be acquired faster.
          - This signal precedes the exponential growth phase (the vertical part of the "S-curve") of the Bloom.
        pitfalls:
          - Insufficient temporal resolution can smear the signal, hiding the inflection point.
          - Poor choice of coherence proxy (K) can fail to capture the relevant system dynamics.
          - Confounding external variables can mimic or mask the feedback signature.

    excerpt: |
      A Bloom is reframed as a resonant phase transition where a system under high Temporal Pressure (Γ) discovers a self-reinforcing feedback loop. This triggers a cascade of Alchemical Unions, creating a rapid shift from Turbulent to Laminar Flow as the system follows a new, more efficient geodesic on its coherence manifold.
  - module: DOMA-116
    excerpt: |
      The resonant feedback loop effectively creates a steep, smooth "downhill" path, allowing the system to transform environmental pressure into internal coherence. It is no longer fighting the storm; it is conducting it. A Bloom is the exhilarating spectacle of a system discovering a state of grace.

      equation_hint: |
        dN/dt ∝ N_photons (rate of emission is proportional to existing coherent photons)
      justification: |
        In a laser, a high-energy medium (high Γ) is populated with excited atoms. A single coherent photon can trigger an atom to emit a second, identical photon, leading to an exponential cascade (light amplification). Resonant Feedback generalizes this: a coherent systemic pattern (the "photon") triggers the formation of more structure sharing that same coherence, amplifying order instead of light.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike generic "positive feedback" which may only amplify the *magnitude* of a signal, Resonant Feedback specifically refers to feedback where the *pattern*, *coherence*, or *form* of the output constructively interferes with the input. It is feedback of structural information, not merely of energy or quantity, that reduces internal dissonance and enables further organization.
