    The target, captured, begins to carve their own cage, mistaking the familiar grooves of their subjugation for the comfort of home.
  law: |
    A cognitive or behavioral pathway, repeatedly traversed under manipulative pressure, will lower its activation energy, becoming a preferred geodesic of thought and action even in the absence of the original pressure.
  philosophy: |
    This process represents the endpoint of Coherence Capture, where external control is internalized as a stable, self-perpetuating pathology. It demonstrates that the most profound manipulation is not a single act, but the teaching of a new, harmful habit of being.
pirouette_definition: |
  The process by which a target, repeatedly guided along a manipulator's false geodesic, actively carves a new Wound Channel into their own coherence manifold. This channel, a pathological habit of thought or behavior, becomes a path of least resistance, making the manipulator's desired outcome a self-sustaining, default response for the target, even after the initial manipulative pressure is removed.

          1. Establish a baseline (t=0) decision time and choice preference for a subject across a set of controlled stimuli.
          2. Expose the subject to a manipulative dynamic featuring a false geodesic related to one of the choices.
          3. At intervals (t=1, t=2...), re-measure decision time and choice.
          4. Parasitic Channeling is indicated by a statistically significant decrease in latency for the manipulated choice and an increase in its selection frequency, which persists after the manipulator is removed.

        Both Hebbian learning and Parasitic Channeling describe a mechanism where repeated, correlated activation strengthens a pathway, making it more likely to fire in the future. Parasitic Channeling is the specific application of this principle to a cognitive pathway that is artificially strengthened by a manipulator to serve an external purpose at the target's expense.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a standard `WOUND_CHANNEL`, which typically forms from direct trauma and represents a geometric weakness, a Parasitic Channel is actively carved by the target under manipulative influence. It is "parasitic" because its existence and function primarily benefit an external agent, often at a metabolic or coherence cost to the host.

# Parasitic Channeling

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The process by which a target, repeatedly guided along a manipulator's false geodesic, actively carves a new Wound Channel into their own coherence manifold. This channel, a pathological habit of thought or behavior, becomes a path of least resistance, making the manipulator's desired outcome a self-sustaining, default response for the target, even after the initial manipulative pressure is removed.

## EFT-First Summary
Parasitic Channeling is the conceptual analog to Hebbian plasticity in neuroscience ("cells that fire together, wire together"). A manipulator induces the target to repeatedly activate a specific cognitive pathway (the "false geodesic"). This repetition strengthens the underlying connections, functionally lowering the activation energy for that line of thought or behavior. The result is a self-sustaining habit that serves the manipulator's goals, effectively programming a vulnerability into the target's cognitive architecture.
