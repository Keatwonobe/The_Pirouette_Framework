    The silent, pre-spatial loom on which the threads of force are first woven. It is the unobserved geometry of "when" from which the observed physics of "where" is projected.
  law: |
    All gauge structures and their associated Noether currents are fundamentally defined on the Time-Substrate Manifold \(\mathcal{M}_\tau\) as properties of the Ki field. Observable spacetime physics is the Σ-pushforward of this underlying geometry; the Σ-map must preserve gauge covariance for this correspondence to hold.
  philosophy: |
    This manifold embodies the principle that spacetime is not fundamental, but an emergent projection of a deeper, non-spatial reality. It provides a common origin for both Lorentz and gauge symmetries, deriving them as consequences of a single substrate's geometry.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Time-Substrate Manifold, \(\mathcal{M}_\tau\), is the base manifold upon which the Ki field is defined, \(Ki:\mathcal{M}_\tau\to\mathcal{F}\). It constitutes a pre-spatial geometric arena whose coordinate, τ, represents a fundamental temporal degree of freedom. The internal geometry of Ki over \(\mathcal{M}_\tau\), including its connections (\(A_\mu\)) and curvatures (\(F_{\mu\nu}\)), gives rise to observable Yang-Mills gauge fields and their associated dynamics upon projection into observer spacetime (\(\mathcal{M}_{x,t}\)) via the Σ-map.

          The geometry of \(\mathcal{M}_\tau\) is not directly probed. Its properties, such as curvature densities, are inferred by measuring the values of physical gauge couplings (\(g_N\)) in observer spacetime. The relation \(g_N^{-2} = \langle \mathrm{Tr}(T^A T^A) \rangle_\tau^{-1}\) from XAP-006 allows the calculation of geometric averages over \(\mathcal{M}_\tau\).

      Let \(Ki : \mathcal{M}_\tau \rightarrow \mathcal{F}\), where \(\mathcal{M}_\tau\) is the time-substrate manifold. The fiber’s isometry group \(G=\mathrm{U}(N)\) acts by \(Ki\mapsto U Ki\).

    excerpt: |
      The spatialization map \(\Sigma:\mathcal{M}_\tau\!\to\!\mathcal{M}_{x,t}\) transports internal parallel transport into the observer’s spacetime chart. Because Σ preserves the Noether currents of MATH-024, gauge covariance survives the pushforward. Thus Yang–Mills structure emerges as the Σ-shadow of internal τ-space holonomy.

        Both are lower-dimensional base manifolds from which higher-dimensional physics (spacetime and particles) emerges. \(\mathcal{M}_\tau\) is a 1D base for fields, while the string world-sheet is 2D.

Its coordinate τ should not be confused with the proper time of a particle moving in \(\mathcal{M}_{x,t}\), although the two may be related under specific Σ maps.

# Time-Substrate Manifold

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Time-Substrate Manifold, \(\mathcal{M}_\tau\), is the base manifold upon which the Ki field is defined, \(Ki:\mathcal{M}_\tau\to\mathcal{F}\). It constitutes a pre-spatial geometric arena whose coordinate, τ, represents a fundamental temporal degree of freedom. The internal geometry of Ki over \(\mathcal{M}_\tau\), including its connections (\(A_\mu\)) and curvatures (\(F_{\mu\nu}\)), gives rise to observable Yang-Mills gauge fields and their associated dynamics upon projection into observer spacetime (\(\mathcal{M}_{x,t}\)) via the Σ-map.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory terms, the Time-Substrate Manifold acts as a source dimension for the coefficients and structure of the Standard Model Lagrangian. Its geometric properties, when pushed forward into spacetime, determine the gauge group (\(\mathrm{SU}(3)\!\times\!\mathrm{SU}(2)\!\times\!\mathrm{U}(1)\)), the values of the coupling constants (\(g_N\)), and the dynamics of the Higgs mechanism, effectively encoding the content of the Standard Model in a pre-spatial geometric object.
