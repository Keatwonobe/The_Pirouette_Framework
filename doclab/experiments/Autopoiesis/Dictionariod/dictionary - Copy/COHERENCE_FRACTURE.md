        This module describes the physics of that breaking. It presents the universal dynamic of catastrophic reconfiguration known as the **Coherence Fracture**, or the "Snap." This is not a slow evolution, but a violent, instantaneous phase transition that occurs when a system's established identity‚Äîits deeply carved **Wound Channel** (CORE-011)‚Äîcan no longer contain the pressure of an incompatible truth from its environment.

    Pain is the sound of a map being redrawn. A crisis is not a failure but the percussive downbeat announcing that a new, more resilient song is about to begin.
  law: |
    A system with a rigid identity (Ki) subjected to overwhelming, incompatible environmental pressure (Œì) will undergo a catastrophic phase transition that shatters its Ki, rather than bend or adapt, releasing its stored coherence energy as dissonant information.
  philosophy: |
    Wisdom is not found in the strength of convictions but in the willingness to see them shattered. The Fracture is the universe‚Äôs non-linear, geometric solution to an unsolvable problem, proving that even the most painful crisis is governed by the drive toward a more elegant and stable state of being.

  A violent, instantaneous phase transition where a system's rigid identity (Ki), embodied by its Wound Channel, shatters under overwhelming environmental pressure (Œì). The collapse of temporal coherence (KœÑ) releases stored energy and forces an Alchemical Union, reconfiguring the system from a simple, stable state to one of higher complexity and adaptive wisdom.

        outline: |
          Monitor a system's temporal coherence (`KœÑ`) and internal energy expenditure (`ƒñ_sys`) while introducing a controlled dissonant environmental signal (`Œì`). A pre-fracture state is indicated by `KœÑ` holding steady while `ƒñ_sys` increases non-linearly (Turbulent Flow). The Fracture event is a singularity marked by a near-instantaneous drop in `KœÑ` to near zero, a sharp spike in informational entropy output, and a collapse in `ƒñ_sys`.
        expected_signals: [Pre-event: rising `ƒñ_sys` at constant `KœÑ`. Event: `dKœÑ/dt ‚Üí -‚àû`, spike in Shannon entropy, drop in `ƒñ_sys`. Post-event: emergence of new stable `Ki'` with resilience to `Œì`.]
        pitfalls: [System fails to re-cohere post-fracture (annihilation). Mistaking a simple logic-gate flip for a full Fracture. Environmental noise masking the entropic burst.]

    excerpt: |
      The accumulated stress does not just disrupt the flow; it fractures the channel itself. The geometric integrity of the Wound Channel fails. In a single, catastrophic phase transition, the system's foundational Ki pattern shatters, and its Temporal Coherence (KœÑ) collapses. The immense energy that maintained the rigid identity is released in a violent burst of dissonant information. This is the silent scream of a universe being unwritten; the moment pain becomes data.
  - module: DOMA-012
    excerpt: |
      The Coherence Fracture is the ultimate expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`. The Dissonant Current causes the environmental pressure term (`V_Œì`) to spike to a degree that overwhelms the system's internal coherence (`K_œÑ`). The Snap is the Lagrangian's escape valve... a phase transition that violently seeks a new Ki, a new geodesic, that can once again maximize coherence.

      justification: |
        Catastrophe theory models how continuous changes in control parameters (rising environmental pressure `Œì`) can cause discontinuous jumps in a system's state (the identity `Ki`). The Coherence Fracture is a canonical example of a system moving along a stable manifold until it folds, forcing a violent transition to a new stable state.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'Decoherence,' a gradual loss of phase information to an environment. A Coherence Fracture is a violent, internal reconfiguration *caused* by environmental pressure, not a passive bleed of information. It is a system-level event, not a quantum-to-classical transition.

# Coherence Fracture

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A violent, instantaneous phase transition where a system's rigid identity (Ki), embodied by its Wound Channel, shatters under overwhelming environmental pressure (Œì). The collapse of temporal coherence (KœÑ) releases stored energy and forces an Alchemical Union, reconfiguring the system from a simple, stable state to one of higher complexity and adaptive wisdom.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Fracture is operationally equivalent to a cusp catastrophe in the potential landscape governing a system's identity. As external stress (control parameter `b`, or `Œì`) increases against a rigid internal structure (control parameter `a`), the system's state variable is forced into a discontinuous jump to a new potential minimum. This catastrophic event releases stored potential energy, corresponding to the violent reconfiguration of the system. This model provides a mathematical basis for sudden paradigm shifts and transformative crises.
