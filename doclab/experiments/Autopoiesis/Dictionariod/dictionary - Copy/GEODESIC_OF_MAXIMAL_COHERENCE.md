        As established in CORE-006, any system will naturally evolve along a path that maximizes its coherence (`K_œÑ`) while minimizing the environmental cost of its existence (`V_Œì`). This path of least resistance is its geodesic.

  art: |
    The invisible riverbed of a system's health, a path of least resistance carved through the landscape of possibility. To follow it is to flow; to deviate is to freeze, shatter, or fade away.
  law: |
    A system's trajectory through its state space is a Geodesic of Maximal Coherence if and only if it locally maximizes the time-integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`S_p = ‚à´(K_œÑ - V_Œì) dt`), representing the path of greatest stability for the least cost.
  philosophy: |
    This concept transforms failure from a random event into a predictable geometric deviation. It posits that health is not a static state to be achieved but a dynamic trajectory to be navigated, making diagnosis and intervention a matter of course correction rather than brute-force repair.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Geodesic of Maximal Coherence is the optimal trajectory a system follows through its coherence manifold over time. This path is defined by the principle of least action applied to the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`), maximizing integrated coherence (`‚à´K_œÑ dt`) while minimizing the integrated cost of existence (`‚à´V_Œì dt`). Deviations from this geodesic manifest as the four fundamental pathways of decoherence: Lock, Fracture, Drift, and Rebound.

          1. Collect time-series data of a system's key state variables.
          2. Establish a model for system coherence (`K_œÑ`) and environmental cost (`V_Œì`) based on the data.
          3. Use variational methods to compute the ideal path (`Œ≥_K`) that maximizes the action `S_p = ‚à´(K_œÑ - V_Œì) dt`.
          4. Compare the system's observed historical path to the computed geodesic (`Œ≥_K`). The magnitude and character of the deviation diagnose the system's dynamic state (e.g., Laminar Flow, Drift, Lock).

      This module replaces the static "Reality Funnel" of PPS-026 with a more dynamic, time-first concept: the **geodesic of maximal coherence**. This geodesic is the optimal path a system traces as it follows the Pirouette Lagrangian‚Äîthe invisible riverbed of its own health. The four pathways‚ÄîLock, Fracture, Drift, and Rebound‚Äîare not arbitrary events, but specific, predictable deviations from this path.

      As established in CORE-006, any system will naturally evolve along a path that maximizes its coherence (`K_œÑ`) while minimizing the environmental cost of its existence (`V_Œì`). This path of least resistance is its geodesic. In the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), a system in a state of **Laminar Flow** is one that is successfully navigating this geodesic channel.

        The mathematical and conceptual structure are explicitly borrowed from Lagrangian mechanics, providing a robust formal basis for system dynamics. The geodesic is the path that extremizes the 'action' integral (`S_p`), where system Coherence (`K_œÑ`) acts as the kinetic term and Environmental Cost (`V_Œì`) acts as the potential term. The path of a healthy system is treated as a trajectory that optimizes this trade-off.

    In Pirouette, 'geodesic' always refers to a trajectory in the abstract coherence manifold, not physical spacetime, unless specified. It is an optimal path defined by a system's internal dynamics (`K_œÑ`) and environmental pressures (`V_Œì`), not by gravitational curvature.

# Geodesic of Maximal Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Geodesic of Maximal Coherence is the optimal trajectory a system follows through its coherence manifold over time. This path is defined by the principle of least action applied to the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`), maximizing integrated coherence (`‚à´K_œÑ dt`) while minimizing the integrated cost of existence (`‚à´V_Œì dt`). Deviations from this geodesic manifest as the four fundamental pathways of decoherence: Lock, Fracture, Drift, and Rebound.

## EFT-First Summary
The Geodesic of Maximal Coherence is a direct application of the **Principle of Least Action** from classical mechanics to general system dynamics. It models a system's evolution as a trajectory (`Œ≥_K`) that minimizes an action integral `S_p = ‚à´ùìõ_p dt`. The Pirouette Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`, treats system coherence (`K_œÑ`) as a kinetic energy term and environmental cost (`V_Œì`) as a potential energy term. The geodesic is therefore the most efficient, stable, and "natural" path the system can follow.
