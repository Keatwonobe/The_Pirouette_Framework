  art: |
    The silent hum of a forgotten cosmic string, whose lingering tension now stretches the void. A vacuum not empty, but braced against its own collapse by the memory of structure.
  law: |
    The energy density of the vacuum is equal to the residual stiffness of the Γ-field, yielding an effective cosmological constant Λ_eff ∝ Γ_stiff². Its value must be consistent with the observed cosmic acceleration, and its rate of change must be less than 0.1% of the Hubble rate per Hubble time, a condition met if the RG-flow parameter ε < 10⁻².
  philosophy: |
    Residual Γ-Stiffness transforms the cosmological constant from a fine-tuned fundamental parameter into a calculable, dynamic property of the vacuum. It provides a physical origin for dark energy, grounding it in the measurable properties of the pressuron sector and making it subject to falsification by laboratory and cosmological tests.
pirouette_definition: |
  Residual Γ-Stiffness is the non-zero ground state stiffness of the superfluid pressuron condensate (Γ-field) that persists in the cosmological vacuum. This remnant stiffness manifests as a potential energy density, ρ_{Γ,res}, which is identified with the effective cosmological constant, Λ_eff. Its magnitude is determined by the fundamental parameters of the pressuron sector, primarily the background coherence density (Γ₀) and self-coupling (λ_Γ), while its slow evolution is governed by the renormalization group (RG) flow of these couplings.

        outline: |
          Infer the value of the effective cosmological constant, Λ_eff, from its effect on the cosmic expansion history. This involves a joint likelihood analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum (angular scale of the sound horizon), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) as a standard ruler, and Type Ia Supernovae luminosity distances.

        outline: |
          Constrain the time-evolution of Λ_eff (and thus the stiffness) by measuring the dark energy equation of state w(a) as a function of scale factor. This is pursued by combining galaxy clustering data (from Euclid, DESI) with CMB lensing and Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) cross-correlations.
        expected_signals: [A measurement of w deviating from -1, or dw/da being non-zero, consistent with RG flow predictions.]

      XAP-007 anchors the Pirouette cosmological sector in measurable reality. All known laboratory, astrophysical, and cosmological data are consistent with a 10–30 MeV composite pressuron with couplings $\kappa\!\sim\!10^{-3}$ and healing length \(10^{-5}\!-\!10^{-3}\) m. The remaining parameter window defines a decisive target for forthcoming experiments.

        Because the stiffness is determined by parameters subject to renormalization group flow, it can evolve slowly over cosmic time. This maps the concept onto models of dynamic dark energy (quintessence), where the equation of state parameter `w` can deviate from -1, providing a direct observational test.

        The primary claim of XAP-006E and XAP-007 is that the residual stiffness *is* the physical source of the effective cosmological constant observed in cosmology. This provides a direct, operational mapping where Λ in the Friedmann equations is sourced by the Γ-field's vacuum energy density.

    `Residual Γ-Stiffness` refers specifically to the potential energy density of the Pirouette Γ-field in its vacuum state. It should not be confused with the kinetic stiffness associated with propagating pressuron waves or with unrelated uses of the symbol Γ.

# Residual Γ-Stiffness

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Residual Γ-Stiffness is the non-zero ground state stiffness of the superfluid pressuron condensate (Γ-field) that persists in the cosmological vacuum. This remnant stiffness manifests as a potential energy density, ρ_{Γ,res}, which is identified with the effective cosmological constant, Λ_eff. Its magnitude is determined by the fundamental parameters of the pressuron sector, primarily the background coherence density (Γ₀) and self-coupling (λ_Γ), while its slow evolution is governed by the renormalization group (RG) flow of these couplings.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory, Residual Γ-Stiffness provides a dynamical origin for the cosmological constant, Λ. It is the vacuum expectation value of a potential energy term, `V(Γ)`, in the Lagrangian for the scalar Γ-field. Unlike the standard Λ, which is a constant of nature, this term can evolve logarithmically with the energy scale according to its renormalization group flow, leading to testable predictions for the dark energy equation of state, `w(a)`. This links the largest scales (cosmology) to the microphysics of a new light scalar sector.
