    The interaction vertex is just two clocks agreeing on what “now” means while moving through a living medium of time.
  law: |
    A spinor's kinetic term must be constructed using the covariant derivative `D_μ = ∇_μ - iqA_μ`, which subtracts the local time-phase connection `A_μ` from the spinor's phase change. This enforces local phase-locking, and the interaction vertex `q\bar\Psi\gamma^\mu A_\mu\Psi` is the work required to maintain this lock.
  philosophy: |
    Reframes the QED interaction not as a fundamental force exchange, but as the energetic consequence of a charged particle (a time-defect) maintaining a coherent phase relationship with the time-phase of the background medium. This grounds gauge theory in the dynamics of information and coherence.

  Clock Synchronization is the dynamical process by which a Ki-defect spinor's internal U(1) phase (its "clock") is locally locked to the U(1) time-phase of the substrate. This lock is enforced by replacing the partial derivative `∇_μ` with the covariant derivative `D_μ = ∇_μ - iqA_μ` in the spinor's kinetic term. The resulting term, `q\bar\Psi\gamma^\mu A_\mu\Psi`, is the QED interaction vertex, interpreted as the energetic cost (or "work") of maintaining this synchronization against spacetime variations.

          Measure the scattering cross-section of charged leptons (e.g., e⁻-e⁻ scattering or Compton scattering). The observed cross-section is directly proportional to the square of the interaction vertex strength, which is governed by the coupling `q`. The consistency of `q` across different processes and energy scales validates the minimal coupling form derived from clock synchronization.

        The Clock Synchronization postulate derives the minimal coupling prescription of QED. The mathematical form is identical, but Pirouette provides a physical interpretation: the gauge field `A_μ` is a connection on a U(1) bundle of local time-phases, and the coupling is the work done to keep the spinor's internal phase locked to it.

# Clock Synchronization

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Clock Synchronization is the dynamical process by which a Ki-defect spinor's internal U(1) phase (its "clock") is locally locked to the U(1) time-phase of the substrate. This lock is enforced by replacing the partial derivative `∇_μ` with the covariant derivative `D_μ = ∇_μ - iqA_μ` in the spinor's kinetic term. The resulting term, `q\bar\Psi\gamma^\mu A_\mu\Psi`, is the QED interaction vertex, interpreted as the energetic cost (or "work") of maintaining this synchronization against spacetime variations.

## EFT-First Summary
In standard QFT, Clock Synchronization corresponds to the principle of **minimal coupling**, where the interaction between a charged fermion (`\Psi`) and the electromagnetic field (`A_μ`) is introduced by promoting the partial derivative to a gauge-covariant derivative: `∂_μ → D_μ = ∂_μ - iqA_μ`. This procedure generates the QED interaction vertex `q\bar\Psi\gamma^μ A_μ\Psi` axiomatically. The Pirouette Framework provides a physical interpretation for this rule, deriving it from the requirement that the fermion's internal phase remains coherent with the local time-phase of the background.
