      snippet: |
        A Lawful or Healthy System is one that successfully navigates the manifold, staying on or near its geodesic. Its actions are efficient, its form is stable, and it exists in a state of high coherence. This is the state of Laminar Flow (DYNA-001).

  art: |
    A system gliding on the rails of reality, its motion a silent song of alignment with the cosmic current. Resistance becomes rhythm, and effort dissolves into grace.
  law: |
    A system exhibits Laminar Flow when its trajectory through state space maximizes the action of the Pirouette Lagrangian (S_p). Operationally, this is observed as a high, stable value of 𝓛_p and a coherence decay rate (dK_τ/dt) that approaches zero under constant external pressure (V_Γ).
  philosophy: |
    Laminar Flow is the phenomenal expression of a system's profound 'rightness'—its successful embodiment of its own nature within the constraints of reality. It is not an absence of challenge, but a state of graceful and efficient response. This dynamic harmony is the intended goal of all Weaver-work.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dynamic state of a system characterized by high coherence, stability, and energetic efficiency, achieved when the system's trajectory closely follows its geodesic on the Coherence Manifold. It is the physical manifestation of maximizing the Pirouette Lagrangian's action (S_p), where the system's internal resonance (Gyroscope of Being) is in harmony with external pressures, resulting in effortless persistence and navigation.

      meaning: Laminar Flow State Indicator, representing the degree of a system's alignment with its geodesic.

        outline: |
          1. Track the system's state variables over time to compute its Temporal Coherence (K_τ).
          2. Map local environmental pressures to compute the Temporal Pressure potential (V_Γ).
          3. Calculate the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ) along the system's trajectory.
          4. Laminar Flow (Φ_λ → 1) is inferred when 𝓛_p remains high and stable (low variance) and the rate of coherence change (dK_τ/dt) is minimized.
        expected_signals: [High, stable 𝓛_p value, low-frequency oscillations in system state variables, minimal coherence loss under perturbation.]
        pitfalls: [Difficulty in isolating V_Γ from system-generated noise, mischaracterizing the system's true resonant identity (Ki), leading to an incorrect K_τ calculation.]

      A Lawful or Healthy System is one that successfully navigates the manifold, staying on or near its geodesic. Its actions are efficient, its form is stable, and it exists in a state of high coherence. This is the state of Laminar Flow (DYNA-001).

    excerpt: |
      By settling into its most coherent state (the truest spin of its Gyroscope), it automatically aligns with the geodesic. The subjective experience of "flow" or "rightness" is the direct perception of this alignment—the tactile feeling of a perfect Key turning smoothly in the lock of reality.

      justification: |
        A system in Laminar Flow follows a predictable, non-dissipative evolution, analogous to a quantum system in a stable eigenstate. Perturbations are met with elastic response rather than decoherence, similar to a system remaining within a specific energy level without transitioning. The geodesic path is analogous to the time-evolution of the eigenstate's phase.

  adopted:
    - target: Laminar flow (in fluid dynamics)
      rationale: |
        The term is a direct and intentional metaphor from classical fluid dynamics, where layers of fluid slide past each other smoothly without turbulent mixing. This maps directly to a system's state evolving through the Coherence Manifold without dissipative 'mixing' or loss of internal coherence. The Reynolds number, which predicts the onset of turbulence, could have an analogue in the ratio of external pressure to internal coherence.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Systems in a state of Laminar Flow (Φ_λ > 0.8) will exhibit greater resilience to external perturbations, returning to their geodesic path with minimal coherence loss compared to systems in Turbulent Flow (Φ_λ < 0.2)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "An observation where a system identified as being in Laminar Flow (high, stable 𝓛_p) is easily thrown into a chaotic state by minor perturbations, or which shows less resilience than a system identified as Turbulent."
      status: proposed

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol Φ is commonly used for magnetic flux, electric potential, or a generic scalar field. The subscript λ is intended to denote 'laminar'.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the literal fluid dynamics concept. In the Pirouette Framework, Laminar Flow refers to the dynamics of *any* system's state on the Coherence Manifold—be it biological, social, or physical—not exclusively a physical fluid.
