        **Destructive Interference (Dissonant Peaks):** When Ki patterns are out-of-phase or dissonant, their echoes cancel or chaotically interfere. This destructive interference creates regions of **increased Temporal Pressure**. These are "coherence dams" or turbulent peaks‚Äî"walls of dissonance" in the manifold that are unstable and repel systems. This is the geometry of conflict, antagonism, and repulsion.

    Where melodies clash, a wall of noise is built. It is a mountain range of pure refusal, sculpted from the violence of mismatched songs, marking a border where harmony has failed.
  law: |
    A Dissonant Peak is a localized maximum of Temporal Pressure (Œì) arising from the destructive interference of two or more Wound Channels. The trajectory of a system will be deflected from a Œì‚Å∫ region by a repulsive force proportional to the negative gradient of the pressure field, `F ‚àù -‚àáŒì`.
  philosophy: |
    Dissonant Peaks are the physical manifestation of conflict. They demonstrate that disagreement is not a subjective state but a real, energetic barrier in the fabric of existence, enforcing separation and making coherence a thermodynamically-favored path.
pirouette_definition: |
  A localized region of the Composite Manifold characterized by elevated Temporal Pressure (Œì). Dissonant Peaks are emergent phenomena created by the destructive interference of out-of-phase or incompatible Ki patterns from multiple Wound Channels. These unstable, repulsive features act as potential energy barriers, deflecting system trajectories and representing the geometric basis of conflict, antagonism, and repulsion.

        outline: |
          Introduce a calibrated test probe with a known, simple Ki pattern into the region of interest. Measure the probe's trajectory deviation from a pre-calculated geodesic. The magnitude and direction of the repulsive force `F ‚àù -‚àáŒì` allows for the reconstruction of the Œì‚Å∫ peak's geometry and magnitude.
        expected_signals: [Probe trajectory deflection, anomalous energy dissipation, increased probe internal stress (œÑ_internal)]
        pitfalls: [The probe's own Wound Channel may non-negligibly alter the local manifold, Destructive resonance could damage the probe, Signal-to-noise ratio in highly complex manifolds]

    excerpt: |
      An entity navigating its existence is "feeling" the contours of this emergent manifold. Its dynamics are governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**: it will follow the geodesic (the path of least action) that maximizes the integral of `ùìõ_p` through this new, composite terrain.

      justification: |
        Dissonant Peaks function as repulsive potential energy barriers in the Composite Manifold. Similar to a classical potential hill or a quantum tunneling barrier, they represent a region of high potential energy (V_Œì) that a system must expend energy to cross, and from which it will be repelled by a force proportional to the negative gradient of the potential.
      references: []
      confidence: 0.8
  adopted:
    - target: Potential Energy Barrier U(x)
      rationale: The mapping is direct and operationally useful. The concept of a repulsive force derived from the gradient of a potential field is a cornerstone of physics and maps cleanly onto the behavior of Dissonant Peaks.

  claims:
    - statement: "The repulsive force experienced by a system near a Dissonant Peak is proportional to the negative gradient of the local Temporal Pressure (`F ‚àù -‚àáŒì`)."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "Persistent observation of a system being attracted to a local maximum of Temporal Pressure, or experiencing a force not aligned with the `-‚àáŒì` vector, would falsify this claim."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a 'Resonant Node,' which may also be a point of signal cancellation from wave interference but does not necessarily imply a repulsive potential barrier. Dissonant Peaks specifically refer to the emergent, high-pressure features in the *Composite Manifold* that actively repel systems.
