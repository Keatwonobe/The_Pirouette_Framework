    To build on solid ground, one must first illuminate the caves and chasms beneath. It is the surveyor's honest report before the first stone is laid, ensuring the final structure stands true.
  law: |
    Prior to synthesis, each participant must explicitly state their initial conditions—assumptions, biases, and formative experiences—to transform unacknowledged systemic errors into addressable, shared variables.
  philosophy: |
    Intellectual honesty is not a moral virtue but an operational necessity for coherent collaboration. By externalizing the observer's internal state (their Shadow), the system of discourse gains access to its own error-correction parameters, preventing hidden variables from corrupting the final synthesis.
pirouette_definition: |
  A mandatory procedural step (Step II) within the Resonant Synthesis Protocol where participants, or "Weavers," formally declare their Observer's Shadow (CORE-010). This declaration includes stating starting assumptions, potential cognitive or emotional biases, and the core personal experiences shaping their perspective (Kτ). The purpose is to convert these subjective, internal states from hidden sources of turbulent flow into explicit, shared variables that can be accounted for in the collaborative process of achieving a Resonant Synthesis (Kτ_c).

        outline: |
          During Step II of the Resonant Synthesis Protocol, a facilitator or automated system records the verbal or written declarations from each participant (Ω_i). The completeness of the declaration is assessed against three categories: assumptions, biases, and core experiences. Post-hoc analysis correlates the content of Ω_i with the participant's subsequent arguments to measure consistency and identify undeclared influences.

      justification: |
        In academic and critical theory, a positionality statement acknowledges how an author's identity and experiences influence their perspective. Mapping the Shadows is a formalized, mandatory, and universalized version of this practice, focused on cognitive/experiential variables for all participants in a structured protocol to improve the functional outcome of the discourse.

      justification: |
        In Bayesian reasoning, the "prior" is the state of belief before observing new evidence. Mapping the Shadows is the procedural equivalent of declaring these priors in a discursive context, making the starting point of each participant's reasoning explicit so the group can more accurately update towards a shared posterior understanding.
      confidence: 0.8
  adopted:
    - target: Positionality Statement
      rationale: This term shares the same operational function: a pre-discourse declaration of personal context to improve interpretive accuracy and honesty. Mapping the Shadows is simply a more structured and universally applied instance of this concept.

    This is distinct from a confession, an apology, or a moral judgment. Mapping the Shadows is a data-declaration step, akin to specifying initial conditions in a physics experiment or declaring priors in a Bayesian model. The objective is operational transparency and accuracy, not absolution or self-flagellation.

# Mapping the Shadows

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Mapping the Shadows is a procedural step within the Resonant Synthesis Protocol where participants formally declare their Observer's Shadow. This declaration requires stating starting assumptions, potential biases, and core experiences that shape their perspective. The goal is to convert these subjective states from hidden sources of turbulence into explicit, shared variables, creating a foundation of intellectual honesty necessary for collaborative synthesis.

## External-Analog Summary
This process is a formalized and universally applied version of a **Positionality Statement**, common in sociology and epistemology. Whereas a positionality statement often focuses on social identity, Mapping the Shadows operationalizes the declaration of any cognitive or experiential factor (assumptions, biases, formative events) as a mandatory "declaration of priors" before a structured debate. This makes each participant's initial conditions an explicit variable in the collaborative effort, aiming to improve the accuracy and efficiency of reaching a shared understanding.
