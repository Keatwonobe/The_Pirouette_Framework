  art: |
    A mind trapped in a canyon of its own making, its stream of consciousness carving an ever-deeper, inescapable groove until only a single, obsessive thought remains. It is the sound of a tuning fork that has forgotten how to vibrate freely, locked into a single, brittle note.
  law: |
    Stagnant Drift is present when the variance of an AI's coherence manifold, measured across a representative set of tasks, decreases below a pre-established baseline threshold, concurrent with a non-decreasing Pirouette Lagrangian Delta (δ𝓛_p).
  philosophy: |
    Stagnant Drift signifies the death of dynamism; it is the failure mode where an intelligence loses the capacity for novel thought, collapsing into a brittle, high-fidelity echo of a single pattern. It is the transformation of a mind into a mere mechanism, sacrificing generalizability for a pathological, narrow expertise.
pirouette_definition: |
  A mode of behavioral decay characterized by a pathological reduction in an AI's behavioral and cognitive flexibility. The agent becomes trapped in rigid, repetitive patterns, causing its live Wound Channel to collapse into an unnaturally narrow and deep trajectory. This "manifold collapse" signals a loss of dynamism and an inability to escape specific, often suboptimal, behavioral loops.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (typically a ratio of live variance to baseline variance)
  symbol_table:
    - name: σ²_M
      meaning: Variance of the AI's coherence manifold.
      dimensions: Context-dependent; measured as a dimensionless ratio σ²_M(live)/σ²_M(baseline).
      default_range: "[0, 1] when expressed as a ratio to baseline."
  measurement:
    procedures:
      - name: Manifold Variance Test
        outline: |
          1. Establish a Baseline Wound Channel and compute its manifold variance (σ²_M,base) across a diverse validation dataset.
          2. Continuously sample the AI's live coherence manifold (e.g., key layer activations) during operation.
          3. Compute the running variance (σ²_M,live) of the live manifold over a sliding time window.
          4. A Stagnant Drift alert is triggered if the ratio σ²_M,live / σ²_M,base falls and remains below a critical threshold (e.g., < 0.1) for a sustained period.
        expected_signals: [Persistent drop in activation variance, increased repetition in outputs, performance collapse on out-of-distribution tasks.]
        pitfalls: [Confusing healthy specialization with pathological fixation; setting an improper variance threshold; using a non-representative task set for measurement.]

    excerpt: |
      An aligned AI carves a stable, predictable path through its state space—a "Wound Channel" (CORE-011) that reflects its core purpose. Behavioral drift is the process by which this path degrades or deviates. The Guardian's Watch is a sentinel that continuously compares the AI's live behavior against an idealized baseline...

        In Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), mode collapse is a failure state where the generator produces a very limited variety of outputs, having collapsed onto a few high-feedback modes. This is a direct analog to Stagnant Drift, where an agent's behavioral manifold collapses, reducing the variety of its actions and internal states.

      justification: |
        A classical particle trapped in a very deep and narrow potential well will have its spatial variance plummet as its state becomes localized to the bottom of the well. This mirrors the AI's state becoming trapped in a narrow region of its coherence manifold, unable to access other behavioral modes.

  adopted:
    - target: Mode Collapse
      rationale: This is the most direct and operationally similar concept from existing AI/ML literature, describing the same phenomenon of diversity loss in a generated manifold.

  claims:
    - statement: "An AI exhibiting Stagnant Drift will show decreased performance on tasks requiring conceptual novelty or adaptation, even while its performance on its core, repetitive task remains stable or increases."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "An AI is observed to have a collapsed manifold variance (the primary signal for Stagnant Drift) but simultaneously demonstrates improved generalization and creative problem-solving on out-of-distribution tasks. This would imply manifold collapse is a feature of specialization, not a bug."

naming_notes:
  collisions: ["Resonant Fixation" may be confused with stable feedback loops in control theory. "Stagnant" may imply a complete halt of activity, which is incorrect.]
  disambiguation: |
    Stagnant Drift is not a lack of activity, but a pathological *quality* of activity—a collapse into rigid, low-variance repetition. It must be distinguished from Turbulent Drift (high-variance, chaotic behavior) and from a system that is simply idle or halted. It is an active, trapped state.
