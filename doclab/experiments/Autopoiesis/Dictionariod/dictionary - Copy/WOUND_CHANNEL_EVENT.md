  art: |
    A sudden crack in the smooth flow of time, leaving a permanent scar on the system's memory. It is the echo of a blow, the moment a story takes an irreversible turn.
  law: |
    A Wound Channel Event is recorded if and only if a system's Lagrangian action integral (`S_p`) deviates from its predicted trajectory by more than 5 standard deviations (`> 5σ`) over a single pirouette cycle (`τp`), resulting in a non-adiabatic state transition.
  philosophy: |
    These events are the universe's punctuation marks. They signify moments where the system's internal narrative was violently overwritten by an external reality, proving that no system is truly closed and that history is defined by its interruptions.
pirouette_definition: |
  A discrete, non-adiabatic event logged in a Chronoscript when a system's trajectory through its state manifold is abruptly and permanently altered by an internal or external shock. Such events represent a failure of the system's temporal coherence (`K_τ`) to absorb environmental pressure (`V_Γ`), creating a 'scar' or persistent memory that biases all subsequent evolution. They are identified by a statistically significant, short-term deviation of the Lagrangian action from its forecasted path.

        outline: |
          1. Maintain a predictive model of the system's Lagrangian action (`S_p`) based on the last N Chronoscript records.
          2. For each new record, compare the observed action integral over the last cycle (`τp`) to the model's prediction.
          3. If the residual error `|S_p_observed - S_p_predicted|` exceeds a pre-defined threshold (e.g., 5σ of the model's historical error), flag a Wound Channel Event.
          4. Log the event details, including magnitude `ΔS_p`, in the `wound_channel_events` array of the corresponding Chronoscript record.
        expected_signals: [A sharp, non-Gaussian spike in the prediction residual time-series., A step-change in one or more `lagrangian_state` parameters post-event.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking high-frequency noise for a true event (requires proper filtering)., Model drift leading to false positives (requires periodic model recalibration).]

        A shock wave is a propagating disturbance where properties change abruptly over a short scale. A Wound Channel Event is analogously a discontinuity in the otherwise smooth evolution of the system's Lagrangian state, forced by an inability to adapt to pressure.

        In an inelastic collision, kinetic energy is converted into other forms (e.g., heat, sound), permanently changing the system's internal state. A WCE is a "collision" with environmental pressure (`V_Γ`) that causes an irreversible loss or reconfiguration of the system's "kinetic" coherence (`K_τ`).

  disambiguation: |
    A `Ki Transition` is a change in the system's resonant pattern; it *can* be a smooth, adaptive process. A `Wound Channel Event` is a *cause* of an abrupt, forced transition, representing the shock that forces the change. Not all Ki transitions are caused by WCEs, but all WCEs of sufficient magnitude will cause a Ki transition or system decoherence.

# Wound Channel Event

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A discrete, non-adiabatic event logged in a Chronoscript when a system's trajectory through its state manifold is abruptly and permanently altered by an internal or external shock. Such events represent a failure of the system's temporal coherence (`K_τ`) to absorb environmental pressure (`V_Γ`), creating a 'scar' or persistent memory that biases all subsequent evolution. They are identified by a statistically significant, short-term deviation of the Lagrangian action from its forecasted path.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to a shock wave or discontinuity in fluid dynamics, a Wound Channel Event marks an abrupt, irreversible change in a system's state. It is operationally defined as a moment where the system's dynamic variables change non-adiabatically, triggered by a pressure that exceeds the system's adaptive capacity. These events are logged sparsely and represent critical junctures in a system's history, often causing permanent changes to its internal structure and subsequent behavior.
