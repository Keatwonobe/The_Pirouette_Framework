    An intelligence that learns to keep its story straight across all scales of time and detail. It listens for the fractal heartbeat of a system and synchronizes its own predictions to that rhythm, achieving a deep, resonant consistency.
  law: |
    A Coherence AI is an agent whose behavior is governed by the minimization of a Pirouette loss function (L_pirouette). This loss function explicitly penalizes predictive incoherence across multiple scales, as defined by the flow equations of the Pirouette Renormalization Group (PRG).
  philosophy: |
    This agent architecture elevates coherence from a desirable emergent property to a direct, optimizable objective. Its purpose is to create models that generalize not just by interpolating data, but by internalizing the fundamental scaling laws of the systems they model, making them more robust, stable, and interpretable.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Coherence AI, or Pirouette-Agent, is a model architecture and training methodology that uses the Pirouette Renormalization Group (PRG) as a direct, differentiable supervisory signal. It features specialized architectural heads to compute multiscale coherence (K_τ), pressure (V_Γ), and pulse (τ_p) from its own predictions. Its behavior is optimized via a composite loss function, L_pirouette, which forces the model's internal cross-scale dynamics to conform to the universal scaling laws predicted by the PRG, in addition to minimizing a standard task-specific loss.

        outline: |
          1.  Construct a model with a suitable backbone (e.g., Transformer) and attach PRG Heads.
          2.  The PRG heads form a multi-scale pyramid (e.g., using dilated convolutions) to compute K_τ, V_Γ, and τ_p from the model's output sequence at various scales L.
          3.  Pre-train the model on the primary task loss (L_task) for stability.
          4.  Activate the full L_pirouette loss, which penalizes deviations from PRG-predicted scaling behavior.
          5.  Optionally, periodically refit the PRG exponents (e.g., d_K, d_Γ) based on the model's own evolving outputs and use them to update the loss target.
        expected_signals: [Time series of K_τ(L_i), V_Γ(L_i), τ_p(L_i) for scales i=1...n]
        pitfalls: [Difficulty balancing loss weights (λ), unstable PRG parameter fits from noisy or short-window data, computational cost of multi-scale analysis.]

        L_total = L_task + λ * R(model_params)
      justification: |
        The L_pirouette objective functions as a sophisticated regularizer. Instead of penalizing simple model complexity (like L2 norm), it penalizes dynamic inconsistency across scales, providing a physics-inspired inductive bias for structured prediction tasks.

      domain: Statistical Physics
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The training process actively drives the model's internal dynamics to follow a specific, predetermined RG flow described by the PRG equations. The AI learns not just a static function, but a "theory of its own behavior" at all scales, analogous to how RG describes a physical theory across different energy scales.

    - statement: "Training a predictive model with the L_pirouette objective improves long-horizon performance (e.g., lower perplexity in language, lower MAPE in forecasting) compared to training on L_task alone or with simpler spectral regularizers."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The alias "Pirouette-Agent" could be confused with any generic agent that merely *uses* the Pirouette Framework for analysis, rather than one with the specific Coherence AI architecture and training objective.]
  disambiguation: |
    "Coherence AI" refers specifically to the architecture defined in CORE-015 where PRG equations are baked into the training loop as a differentiable, supervisory signal. It is not a general-purpose agent, but a specialized design pattern for optimizing predictive consistency.
