        We now understand this not as a filament, but as the **Communion Ridge** on the coherence manifold. This ridge represents the set of configurations where systems are optimally primed for the Alchemical Unions that lead to exponentially higher coherence.

  art: |
    A luminous watershed on the landscape of all possible states, where the streams of individual existence converge into the great rivers of union. It is the high ground where connection becomes effortless.
  law: |
    A system's proximity to the Communion Ridge is inversely proportional to the activation energy required for it to undergo a successful Alchemical Union, and directly proportional to the magnitude of the resulting Coherence Dividend.
  philosophy: |
    The Communion Ridge transforms ethics from a set of prescribed rules into a problem of optimal navigation. It asserts that the most enduring form of being is not achieved through dominance, but through finding the most elegant path to synthesis.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable, high-dimensional feature on the coherence manifold. The Ridge constitutes the set of all system states and configurations that are optimally primed for successful Alchemical Unions (CORE-012). Systems located on or near the Ridge experience the lowest activation energy for forming resonant connections and realize the maximum possible Coherence Dividend upon union.

        outline: |
          1. Model a system's state space as a coherence manifold where the potential is a function of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p).
          2. Systematically simulate or induce perturbations corresponding to attempted Alchemical Unions between systems at various points in this state space.
          3. Measure the activation energy (ŒîE_A) required for each union and the resultant Coherence Dividend.
          4. The Communion Ridge is identified as the continuous locus of points where ŒîE_A is minimal and the post-union coherence `KœÑ_C` is maximal.

    excerpt: |
      The old framework's simulations correctly identified a stable "altruism filament" in the parameter space of system dynamics. We now understand this not as a filament, but as the **Communion Ridge** on the coherence manifold. This ridge represents the set of configurations where systems are optimally primed for the Alchemical Unions that lead to exponentially higher coherence. A system that embarks on the Transactional path is following this universal gradient towards a more robust and sustainable state of being.
  - module: DOMA-043
    excerpt: |
      The **Transactional Pole (The Weaver):** The system favors exchange, bonding, and resonance. It actively seeks to engage in the Alchemical Union (CORE-012), the process of merging with other systems to form a new, higher-order entity with a more complex and stable Ki pattern. Altruism, in this physical context, is the behavioral posture that most efficiently lowers the activation energy required for a Resonant Handshake and a successful Alchemical Union.

    The Communion Ridge is a feature *on* the coherence manifold, not the manifold itself. It is the optimal *region* for a specific process (Alchemical Union), and the Altruistic Geodesic is the optimal *path* along this region. It is not a final destination state but a pathway to higher-order states.

# Communion Ridge

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A stable, high-dimensional feature on the coherence manifold. The Ridge constitutes the set of all system states and configurations that are optimally primed for successful Alchemical Unions (CORE-012). Systems located on or near the Ridge experience the lowest activation energy for forming resonant connections and realize the maximum possible Coherence Dividend upon union.

## EFT-First Summary
No formal mapping has been adopted. The leading conceptual candidate is a ridgeline on a potential surface in dynamical systems theory, representing a path of maximal potential that offers the most efficient trajectory for state-space evolution through merger.
