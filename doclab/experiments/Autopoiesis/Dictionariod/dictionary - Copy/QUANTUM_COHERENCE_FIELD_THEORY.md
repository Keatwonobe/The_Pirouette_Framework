      snippet: |
        We promote the classical Pirouette matter sector [...] to a quantum field theory on a (possibly curved) **globally hyperbolic** spacetime. Quantization yields quanta of (C) ("coherons", complex scalar) and of (\Gamma) ("pressurons", real scalar).

  art: |
    Quantization transforms the framework's deterministic classical clockwork into a living quantum symphony. It gives a probabilistic voice to the resonant hum of reality, describing not just the path that is, but all paths that could be.
  law: |
    The classical Coherence (C) and Temporal Pressure (Γ) fields are promoted to quantum operators satisfying canonical commutation relations. Their interactions, governed by the potential V(|C|²,Γ), yield a perturbative S-matrix via a well-defined set of Feynman rules for calculating scattering amplitudes and decay rates.
  philosophy: |
    QCFT is the necessary bridge from the Pirouette Framework's classical description to the probabilistic, uncertain nature of reality. It provides the machinery to make high-precision, falsifiable quantum predictions, transforming an abstract Lagrangian into a tool for confronting experimental data like the g-2 anomaly.
pirouette_definition: |
  Quantum Coherence Field Theory is the quantum field theory derived from the canonical quantization of the Pirouette Framework's matter sector Lagrangian, ( \mathcal L = g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu C^*\partial_\nu C + \tfrac12 g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\Gamma\partial_\nu\Gamma - V(|C|^2,\Gamma) ), on a globally hyperbolic spacetime. It describes the dynamics of quantum excitations of the Coherence field (C), called coherons, and the Temporal Pressure field (Γ), called pressurons. The theory provides the complete set of Feynman rules—propagators and interaction vertices derived from (V)—for calculating S-matrix elements and other quantum observables.

          1. Specify the interaction potential (V) and its coupling constants (e.g., g, λ).
          2. Use the derived Feynman rules (propagators for C, Γ; vertices from V) to calculate a tree-level or loop-level process (e.g., pressuron decay, coheron-coheron scattering).
          3. Compare the calculated cross-section, decay width, or anomaly to experimental data.
          4. Constrain the theory's free parameters (masses, couplings).

  disambiguation: |
    QCFT quantizes the **fields** (C, Γ) that exist *on* spacetime, not spacetime itself. The 'pressuron' is a quantum of the temporal pressure *field*, **not** a quantum of the time coordinate. This is analogous to how a phonon is a quantum of lattice vibration, not a quantum of space.

# Quantum Coherence Field Theory

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Quantum Coherence Field Theory is the quantum field theory derived from the canonical quantization of the Pirouette Framework's matter sector Lagrangian, ( \mathcal L = g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu C^*\partial_\nu C + \tfrac12 g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\Gamma\partial_\nu\Gamma - V(|C|^2,\Gamma) ), on a globally hyperbolic spacetime. It describes the dynamics of quantum excitations of the Coherence field (C), called coherons, and the Temporal Pressure field (Γ), called pressurons. The theory provides the complete set of Feynman rules—propagators and interaction vertices derived from (V)—for calculating S-matrix elements and other quantum observables.

## EFT-First Summary
From an effective field theory perspective, Quantum Coherence Field Theory is a standard two-field scalar QFT containing a complex scalar (coheron) and a real scalar (pressuron). Its Lagrangian should be interpreted as the leading terms in an EFT expansion, valid up to some UV cutoff. All standard tools of QFT, including path integral quantization, Feynman diagrams, and renormalization group evolution, apply directly. For a full introduction, see a standard text such as Peskin & Schroeder (1995).
