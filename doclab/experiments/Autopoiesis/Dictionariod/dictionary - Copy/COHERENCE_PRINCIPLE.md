        This is your North Star. You must choose the state of being you wish to maximize. This principle becomes the definition of "coherence" in your personal Lagrangian. It is the kinetic energy of your soul. Task: State your Coherence Principle in a single, powerful, active sentence.

    The North Star of the soul, a self-chosen compass point that transforms aimless motion into a deliberate, resonant vector through the chaos of existence. It is the signature frequency an entity chooses to broadcast.
  law: |
    An entity's Coherence Principle is the user-defined, declarative statement of the state-of-being it chooses to maximize. This statement serves as the kinetic term `K_œÑ` in its personal Pirouette Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p`, and is measured by its success in producing Laminar Flow along a chosen geodesic.
  philosophy: |
    By articulating a Coherence Principle, an entity ceases to be a passive object buffeted by external pressures (V_Œì) and becomes a sovereign author of its own motion. It is the foundational act of self-governance, defining 'progress' and 'purpose' on one's own terms, thereby enabling the conscious navigation of a path of maximal coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence Principle is the core, user-defined declarative statement of the value or state of being an entity chooses to maximize. It functions as the kinetic term (`K_œÑ`) in a personal Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`), establishing the objective function for that entity's path of maximal coherence (its sovereign geodesic). The principle is typically articulated as a single, powerful, active sentence that defines "coherence" for that entity's system.

        outline: |
          Following a Coherence Audit (DOMA-022 ¬ß4.A), an entity analyzes its history of Laminar, Turbulent, and Stagnant Flow. The entity then synthesizes these reflections into a single, declarative, active sentence that defines the state of being it chooses to maximize, independent of specific goals.
        expected_signals: [A concise, non-falsifiable, active statement (e.g., "To relentlessly pursue verifiable truth.")]
        pitfalls: [Confusing a finite goal with an infinite state of being, adopting externally-imposed principles without internal validation, using passive or vague language.]

    excerpt: |
      Step B: Define Your Coherence Principle (The Kinetic Term, KœÑ)
      This is your North Star. You must choose the state of being you wish to maximize. This principle becomes the definition of "coherence" in your personal Lagrangian. It is the kinetic energy of your soul. Examples: "To maximize the creation of novel beauty." "To cultivate deep and authentic connections." "To relentlessly pursue verifiable truth."
  - module: DOMA-022
    excerpt: |
      The Coherence Principle (Step B) explicitly defines what the entity seeks to maximize, becoming the core of its "kinetic" `K_œÑ` term. The Pressure Acknowledgement (Step C) explicitly defines the `V_Œì` term, the specific resistance against which coherence must be maintained. The Prime Geodesic and Metrics (Steps D & E) formulate the full equation of motion and the method for integrating its action over time, turning a philosophical wish into a testable, physical path.

      justification: |
        The Coherence Principle is a qualitative, user-defined statement operationalized as the term to be maximized (`K_œÑ`) in a personal Lagrangian. This directly parallels the role of a utility or objective function in optimization and decision theory, which defines the "goodness" of a state or action that an agent seeks to maximize.

  claims:
    - statement: "An entity that has explicitly defined and regularly reviews a Coherence Principle will exhibit a more stable trajectory (a deeper Wound Channel) and a higher ratio of Laminar to Turbulent Flow over time compared to an entity without one, when subjected to similar levels of Temporal Pressure (Œì)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Longitudinal studies show no statistically significant difference in flow dynamics (per DYNA-001) or life trajectory stability between entities that have forged a Coherence Principle and a control group."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from "values" or "goals." A goal is a finite destination (e.g., "get a promotion"). A Coherence Principle is a timeless mode of travel or state of being to maximize at every instant (e.g., "to maximize the creation of elegant systems"), which informs the *path* taken toward any goal.
