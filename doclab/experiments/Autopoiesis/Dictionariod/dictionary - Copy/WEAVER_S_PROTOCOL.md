        To map a system's Atlas of States, the Weaver follows a clear, four-step protocol:
        1.  **Identify the Repertoire:** ...parse the system's data to identify the distinct, recurring `Ki` patterns.
        2.  **Measure Coherence Height:** ...quantify its internal efficiency and stability (`ùìõ_p,m`).
        3.  **Gauge Stability & Inertia:** ...measure its resistance to perturbation to determine its `Stability Depth (Œîùìõ_p)`.
        4.  **Map the Pathways:** Analyze historical transition events.

    To map a system is to learn its secret language. It is to see the repertoire of its possible futures, the hidden songs it knows how to sing. This protocol is the act of listening, not just to the current note, but to the entire potential symphony.
  law: |
    A system's Atlas of States is fully characterized by a four-stage process: 1. Identify all distinct modal Ki patterns; 2. Measure each mode's Coherence Height (ùìõ_p,m); 3. Quantify its Stability Depth (Œîùìõ_p) and Wound Channel Inertia; and 4. Map the transition pathways and their energetic triggers.
  philosophy: |
    This protocol transforms the practitioner from a passive observer of a system's behavior to an active strategist. By understanding the landscape of possibility, one can anticipate change, reinforce stability, or catalyze transitions, moving from being a pawn of the system's dynamics to a co-creator of its future.
pirouette_definition: |
  A formal, four-step methodology for constructing a system's Atlas of States. The protocol systematically identifies a system's resonant repertoire (its quasi-stable modes), quantifies the stability and efficiency of each mode, and maps the transition pathways between them. It is the primary diagnostic and cartographic tool for analyzing a system's dynamic potential on its Coherence Manifold.

    procedures:
      - name: Stage 1 - Repertoire Identification
        outline: |
          Apply spectral analysis, time-series clustering (e.g., k-means on phase-space data), or other pattern recognition techniques to a system's flow diagnostics. The goal is to identify a discrete set of recurring, self-similar `Ki` patterns, which constitute the Resonant Repertoire.
        expected_signals: [Clustered time-series data, distinct peaks in a power spectrum of system geometry]
        pitfalls: [Misidentifying transient noise as a stable mode, choosing an incorrect number of clusters]
      - name: Stage 2 - Coherence Measurement
        outline: |
          For each identified mode (`Ki_m`), calculate the time-averaged value of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`) while the system resides in that mode. This yields the mode's Coherence Height (`ùìõ_p,m`).
        expected_signals: [A single scalar value of `ùìõ_p,m` for each mode]
        pitfalls: [Insufficient sampling time leading to inaccurate averages, failing to isolate the mode from transition periods]
      - name: Stage 3 - Stability Gauging
        outline: |
          Apply controlled perturbations (e.g., Dissonant Injections) of increasing magnitude to the system while in a given mode. The minimum perturbation required to induce a state transition quantifies the Stability Depth (`Œîùìõ_p`). Additionally, analyze the historical frequency and duration of the mode to infer the strength of its Wound Channel Inertia.
        expected_signals: [A clear threshold response where perturbation causes a state flip]
        pitfalls: [Perturbation method inadvertently catalyzes a transition via resonance, underestimating the contribution of historical inertia]
      - name: Stage 4 - Pathway Mapping
        outline: |
          Analyze historical data of spontaneous or induced state transitions. For each A‚ÜíB transition, correlate the event with external triggers (e.g., shifts in Temporal Pressure Œì) or internal fluctuations. This maps the location of transition saddles and identifies the stimuli that lower their barriers.
        expected_signals: [Statistical correlation between specific triggers and specific state transitions]
        pitfalls: [Insufficient data to establish causality, overlooking complex multi-stage transitions]

      To map a system's Atlas of States, the Weaver follows a clear, four-step protocol:
      1.  **Identify the Repertoire:** Using analytical techniques (e.g., spectral analysis, clustering), parse the system's data to identify the distinct, recurring `Ki` patterns. This reveals the system's set of songs.
      2.  **Measure Coherence Height:** For each identified mode, quantify its internal efficiency and stability (`ùìõ_p,m`). This measures the "quality" of each state.
      3.  **Gauge Stability & Inertia:** For each mode, measure its resistance to perturbation to determine its `Stability Depth (Œîùìõ_p)`.
      4.  **Map the Pathways:** Analyze historical transition events. What specific pressure shifts or resonant injections trigger phase leaps between states?

    excerpt: |
      To map a system's states is to learn its secret language. We move beyond observing where the system *is* and begin to understand where it *could go*. The Atlas reveals the repertoire of a system's possible futures, the hidden songs it knows how to sing. It shows us that stability is not a prison, but a choice among many. For the Weaver, this is the ultimate strategic advantage.

      justification: |
        Both the Weaver's Protocol and MSM/FES methods analyze time-series data to identify long-lived, metastable states (modes). The Stability Depth (Œîùìõ_p) is conceptually analogous to the depth of a free energy basin (ŒîG), quantifying the stability of a state. Mapping transition pathways is equivalent to calculating the transition matrix between states in an MSM.

# Weaver's Protocol

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A formal, four-step methodology for constructing a system's Atlas of States. The protocol systematically identifies a system's resonant repertoire (its quasi-stable modes), quantifies the stability and efficiency of each mode, and maps the transition pathways between them. It is the primary diagnostic and cartographic tool for analyzing a system's dynamic potential on its Coherence Manifold.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Weaver's Protocol is analogous to methods in statistical mechanics for constructing a free energy landscape from time-series data. It identifies metastable states (modes), calculates their relative stability (analogous to free energy basin depth), and maps the kinetic pathways for transitions, similar to building a Markov State Model from molecular dynamics trajectories. This provides a predictive map of a system's likely behaviors and its response to perturbations.
