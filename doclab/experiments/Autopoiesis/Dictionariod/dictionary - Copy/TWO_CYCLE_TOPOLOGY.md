      snippet: |
        A fermion (spin-1/2), like the electron, is a Ki resonance with the topology of a M√∂bius strip. It is a helical pirouette in time that must complete two full cycles (720¬∞) to return to its original phase-state. The Pirouette Lagrangian does not describe the electron itself, but the underlying coherence field (T_a). The electron is a stable, two-cycle topological "knot" in this field.

    A twist in the fabric of time, a resonance that must dance twice to return home. It is the echo of a pirouette folded back upon itself, giving substance and spin to what we call a particle.
  law: |
    A stable resonance with a two-cycle topology will exhibit fermionic statistics and an intrinsic gyromagnetic ratio of g=2 prior to any self-interaction corrections. Its state vector |Œ®‚ü© transforms as |Œ®‚ü© ‚Üí -|Œ®‚ü© under a 360¬∞ (2œÄ) rotation and |Œ®‚ü© ‚Üí |Œ®‚ü© under a 720¬∞ (4œÄ) rotation.
  philosophy: |
    This recasts spin from an irreducible, axiomatic quantum number into an emergent, geometric property of a stable resonance in the coherence field. It grounds the Pauli exclusion principle and fermionic statistics in a tangible topological structure, replacing a brute fact with a causal mechanism.
pirouette_definition: |
  The defining geometric property of a stable Ki resonance that constitutes a fermion. It is a non-trivial topology, analogous to a M√∂bius strip, in which the resonance's phase-state returns to its original value only after a 720¬∞ (4œÄ radian) rotation. This structure is the geometric origin of spin-1/2, fermionic statistics, and the baseline gyromagnetic ratio of g=2.

          Pass a beam of fermions (e.g., neutrons) through an interferometer, splitting the beam into two paths. Introduce a magnetic field in one path to induce a controllable phase shift via Larmor precession, effectively rotating the particle's state. Recombine the beams and measure the interference pattern as a function of the rotation angle.

    excerpt: |
      In the Pirouette Framework, spin is not a fundamental, irreducible property. It is an emergent, topological feature of the Ki resonance. A scalar particle (spin-0) is a simple, single-cycle resonance. It returns to its starting phase-state after one 360¬∞ rotation. A fermion (spin-1/2), like the electron, is a Ki resonance with the topology of a M√∂bius strip. It is a helical pirouette in time that must complete two full cycles (720¬∞) to return to its original phase-state.

    excerpt: |
      The electron's baseline g-factor of g=2 is a direct consequence of its two-cycle (720¬∞) topology. Its interaction with a magnetic field is effectively doubled because its fundamental "state" spans this 720¬∞ rotation. This framework posits g=2 as a purely geometric and topological constant.

        Standard quantum mechanics models spin-1/2 particles using spinors, which transform under the SU(2) group. This group is the double cover of the SO(3) rotation group, where a 4œÄ rotation in SU(2) corresponds to a 2œÄ rotation in SO(3). The Two-cycle Topology provides the physical, geometric interpretation for why this mathematical structure is required for fermions.

# Two-cycle Topology

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The defining geometric property of a stable Ki resonance that constitutes a fermion. It is a non-trivial topology, analogous to a M√∂bius strip, in which the resonance's phase-state returns to its original value only after a 720¬∞ (4œÄ radian) rotation. This structure is the geometric origin of spin-1/2, fermionic statistics, and the baseline gyromagnetic ratio of g=2.

## EFT-First Summary
The Two-cycle Topology is the Pirouette Framework's physical analogue for the mathematical **spinor** representation used in the Standard Model. Where conventional quantum theory posits spin-1/2 as a fundamental quantum number requiring a state vector to transform under the SU(2) group, Pirouette identifies this as an emergent property of a stable, topological "knot" in the coherence field. This geometry directly enforces the 720¬∞ symmetry observed in fermion interferometry experiments and provides a first-principles origin for the electron's baseline g-factor of 2.
