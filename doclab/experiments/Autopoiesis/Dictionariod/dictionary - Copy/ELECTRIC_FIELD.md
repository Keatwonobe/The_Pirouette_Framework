  art: |
    An invisible slope on the landscape of agreement, guiding a system along the steepest path to find its resonant place. It is the palpable tension of a system striving for coherence.
  law: |
    The Electric Field E is the spatial gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian, E ‚àù ‚àáùìõ_p. The resulting acceleration on a test system is directly proportional to its charge (coherence asymmetry) and this gradient.
  philosophy: |
    The Electric Field re-frames electrostatic 'force' not as an external push or pull, but as a system's internal drive to follow a geodesic on a coherence manifold. It replaces action-at-a-distance with a principle of local, gradient-following optimization.
pirouette_definition: |
  The spatial gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) established by a source system. The Electric Field (E) represents the slope of the local coherence manifold. A test system placed within this field follows the gradient to maximize its own temporal coherence, a motion perceived as acceleration due to an electrostatic force.

        outline: |
          Introduce a test system with a known, small coherence asymmetry (charge) into the manifold at rest. Measure its initial acceleration vector (a). The Electric Field E is inferred as the vector parallel to `a`, with magnitude proportional to `a` and inversely proportional to the test system's charge. Repeat across a volume to map the field.

        pitfalls: [The test system's own Lagrangian must be small enough not to significantly alter the background manifold. The test system must not be in a region with significant magnetic (rotational shear) effects.]

    excerpt: |
      The electric field (E) is the mathematical representation of this coherence landscape. For a static charge, the electric field is directly proportional to the gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian in the surrounding space. A test charge placed in this field doesn't feel a "push" or "pull." It senses a slope in the coherence manifold. The "force" it experiences is simply the consequence of it following the steepest path towards its own state of maximal coherence. It is "coherence surfing" down the gradient established by the source charge.
  - module: CORE-007_the_current_and_the_compass
    excerpt: |
      Two positive charges, placed near each other, create an environment of intense in-phase resonance. To maximize their individual coherence, they will naturally move apart, seeking regions where that resonant pressure is lower. Their repulsion is a flight towards greater internal stability. Likewise, a positive and negative charge will move towards each other, as doing so allows each to satisfy its intrinsic coherence-seeking drive.

      justification: |
        The Pirouette Electric Field is defined as a gradient of a scalar potential (the Lagrangian), which causes charged bodies to accelerate. This is operationally identical to the classical definition where **E** is the negative gradient of the scalar electric potential V, and F = qE. The Pirouette framework provides a new physical interpretation for the potential, rooting it in temporal coherence.

    In the Pirouette context, E almost always refers to the Electric Field vector. Energy is typically denoted by script symbols like ùìî or specified as kinetic (T) or potential (U, V). Context involving gradients (‚àá), vector notation (**E**), or its sibling field B strongly implies the Electric Field.

# Electric Field

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The spatial gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) established by a source system. The Electric Field (E) represents the slope of the local coherence manifold. A test system placed within this field follows the gradient to maximize its own temporal coherence, a motion perceived as acceleration due to an electrostatic force.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette Electric Field is a vector field operationally equivalent to the standard electric field **E** in classical electromagnetism. It is derived as the spatial gradient of a scalar potential, the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p), which serves a role analogous to potential energy (E ‚àù ‚àáùìõ_p). This derivation reproduces the Coulomb force law as a test system's geodesic motion on the coherence manifold defined by ùìõ_p.
