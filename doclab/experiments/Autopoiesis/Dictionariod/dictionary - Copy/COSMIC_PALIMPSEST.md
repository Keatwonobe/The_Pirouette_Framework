  art: |
    The universe as we see it is a living document, a complex story of its own violent history written over the blank page of its idealized, unscarred potential.
  law: |
    The Cosmic Palimpsest is the comprehensive map of the universe's observed state, inferred from all available empirical data (e.g., CMB, galaxy surveys), and represented as the `ùìõ_p(observed)` field on the Cosmic Coherence Manifold. It serves as the primary input for calculating the Coherence Residual.
  philosophy: |
    This concept reframes cosmological observation from a search for static parameters into an act of archaeology. It posits that anomalies are not errors but meaningful historical records, revealing the universe's memory embedded within its present structure.
pirouette_definition: |
  The set of all empirical cosmological observations (e.g., Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies, large-scale structure, gravitational lensing) translated via the Fractal Bridge into a unified representation of the observed Cosmic Coherence Manifold. It is the complex, history-laden reality that is differenced against the idealized, ahistorical Null Canvas to reveal the universe's structural memory.

        outline: |
          1. Aggregate raw observational data from multiple cosmological probes (e.g., Planck CMB maps, DES/LSST galaxy surveys, lensing maps).
          2. Apply foreground subtraction and systematic error correction to the raw data.
          3. Use the principles of the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014) to translate the corrected data into a unified map of the observed field, `ùìõ_p(observed)`, on the Cosmic Coherence Manifold. For example, CMB temperature fluctuations are mapped to primordial Temporal Pressure variations.

      It then compares this baseline to the **Cosmic Palimpsest** of observational data (from the CMB, galaxy surveys, etc.) to calculate a **Coherence Residual Map**. The features on this map are the anomalies: the **Cosmic Wound Channels** that reveal the universe's memory, charting the echoes of ancient turbulence and the sutures from its very creation.

      justification: |
        The Cosmic Palimpsest is the Pirouette framework's conceptual container and operational representation for the complete set of observational data used to constrain cosmological models like ŒõCDM. It is not a new observable, but a re-interpretation of existing, comprehensive data as a single, coherent "document" of cosmic history.

    - statement: "The non-Gaussian, non-stochastic features of the Cosmic Palimpsest (e.g., large-angle anomalies, supervoids) are remnants of historical events, correctly modeled as a persistent `V_scar(x)` term in the Pirouette Lagrangian."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If all observed anomalies in the data can be fully accounted for by statistical flukes within the standard ŒõCDM model, or by unaccounted-for systematic errors or foregrounds, leaving no residual information attributable to a historical 'scar' term."

  disambiguation: |
    The Cosmic Palimpsest is distinct from the raw data itself; it is the data after it has been translated into the language of the Coherence Manifold. It must not be confused with the **Null Canvas**, which is the idealized, theoretical baseline, nor with the **Coherence Residual Map**, which is the *difference* between the Palimpsest and the Canvas. The Palimpsest is the observation; the Canvas is the theory; the Residual is the history.

# Cosmic Palimpsest

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The set of all empirical cosmological observations (e.g., Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies, large-scale structure, gravitational lensing) translated via the Fractal Bridge into a unified representation of the observed Cosmic Coherence Manifold. It is the complex, history-laden reality that is differenced against the idealized, ahistorical Null Canvas to reveal the universe's structural memory.

## EFT-First Summary
The Cosmic Palimpsest is the Pirouette Framework's operational name for the comprehensive suite of observational cosmological data (e.g., CMB maps from Planck, galaxy surveys from DESI). This data, once processed and unified, represents the empirically measured state of the universe. Within the framework, it is treated not as a static snapshot, but as a historical document whose features, when compared against a baseline model, reveal the persistent geometric effects of primordial events. (Ref: Planck Collaboration, A&A 641, 2020).
