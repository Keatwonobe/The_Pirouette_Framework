        Applying the diagnostic framework of the Caduceus Lens, any organizational ailment can be identified as one of three fundamental disruptions to Laminar Flow.

  art: |
    To see a system not as a machine to be fixed, but as a living body whose fevers and chills reveal a deeper story. It is the art of reading the currents of health and sickness.
  law: |
    Any systemic pathology can be classified as one of three fundamental flow disruptions: Atrophy (blockage), Fever (turbulence), or Erosion (decay), each pointing to a distinct class of intervention.
  philosophy: |
    The Lens reframes diagnosis from static measurement to dynamic pattern recognition, shifting the goal from 'fixing problems' to 'restoring coherence.' It asserts that sustainable health is an emergent property of unimpeded flow, not a designed state.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Caduceus Lens is a universal diagnostic protocol that models a system's health by analyzing the state of its critical flows. It identifies all systemic pathologies as one of three archetypal disruptions—Coherence Atrophy (stagnation), Coherence Fever (turbulence), or Coherence Erosion (decay)—to prescribe precise, minimal interventions (Strategic Levers) that restore the system to a state of Laminar Flow.

        outline: |
          1.  **Map Currents:** Identify and map the system's critical flows (e.g., Capital, Information, Talent, Trust in a business context).
          2.  **Diagnose Flow State:** For each current, assess its state as Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant (Atrophy).
          3.  **Pinpoint Coherence Loss:** Trace the disruptions back to primary blockages (dams) or sources of friction (dissonant injectors).
          4.  **Prescribe Strategic Lever:** Select the appropriate intervention class: 'dam removal' for Atrophy, 'harmonizing signal' for Fever, or 'channel reinforcement' for Erosion.
        expected_signals: [Stalled projects, bureaucratic gridlock (Atrophy), constant crisis management, high employee turnover (Fever), brand decay, loss of institutional knowledge (Erosion)]
        pitfalls: [Confusing the symptoms of one pathology for another (e.g., treating stagnation with a cultural initiative), focusing on surface-level symptoms instead of the underlying flow disruption.]

    excerpt: |
      A business is not a static entity to be measured; it is a living system defined by the quality of its flows. Here, we apply the universal diagnostic protocol of The Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) to the domain of commerce. A healthy, profitable organization is one that achieves a state of Laminar Flow, where value, information, talent, and trust move with effortless efficiency. Pathologies—from bureaucratic gridlock to market panic—are diagnosed as disruptions in this flow.
  - module: DOMA-040
    excerpt: |
      A strategic lever, or "Daedalus Gambit," is a minimal, precise intervention designed to restore the system's own ability to find health. It is not a brute-force reorganization. To resolve Atrophy (Stagnation), the lever is an act of "dam removal." To resolve Fever (Turbulence), the lever is a "harmonizing signal." To resolve Erosion (Decay), the lever is an act of "channel reinforcement."

      justification: |
        The three pathologies map conceptually to common system archetypes. Atrophy (Stagnation) mirrors "Limits to Growth." Fever (Turbulence) resembles "Escalation." Erosion (Decay) aligns with "Drifting Goals." The Lens provides a unifying classification for these dynamic behaviors.

  collisions: [Rod of Asclepius (medical symbol)]
  disambiguation: |
    The Caduceus is the staff of Hermes, the god of commerce, travel, and flow. It was chosen deliberately over the Rod of Asclepius (healing) to emphasize that the Lens diagnoses the health of *flows* (commerce, information, etc.), not just a static state of sickness or health.
