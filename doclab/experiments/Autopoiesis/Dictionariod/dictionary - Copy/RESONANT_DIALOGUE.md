  art: |
    A dance of shadows and light between a mind and a made thing, where each becomes the other's mirror and a new world is born in the reflection.
  law: |
    The quality of an aesthetic experience (Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant Flow) is a direct function of the resonance matching between the observer's and the artwork's coherence manifolds, measurable via psycho-physiological markers of cognitive load and attentional synchronization.
  philosophy: |
    Resonant Dialogue redefines art not as an object to be consumed but as a relational process. It shifts the locus of aesthetic value from the artifact to the interaction, framing consciousness as a dynamic system that can be tuned, perturbed, and transformed by engineered coherence patterns.
pirouette_definition: |
  The active, reciprocal, and time-evolving coupling between the coherence manifold of an artwork (the 'coherence engine') and the coherence manifold of an observer. The artwork projects its Ki pattern, shaping the observer's perceptual flow, while the observer projects their Observer's Shadow, co-creating the work's meaning. The quality of this dialogue determines the resultant aesthetic state (e.g., Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant Flow).

        outline: |
          Present a subject with an artwork while monitoring neural and physiological signals (e.g., fMRI, EEG, HRV). Simultaneously, model the artwork's coherence manifold (M_art) using computational analysis of its formal properties (e.g., Fourier analysis of visual patterns, harmonic analysis of music). The strength of the Resonant Dialogue is inferred from the degree of phase-locking or cross-correlation between the subject's neural signals and the dominant frequencies/patterns of M_art.
        expected_signals: [Phase-locking in alpha/gamma bands (EEG), BOLD signal correlation in default mode network and sensory cortices (fMRI), decreased heart rate variability (HRV) during Laminar Flow.]
        pitfalls: [Confounding variables from observer's prior state (mood, knowledge), difficulty in creating a complete, objective model of M_art.]

    excerpt: |
      Aesthetic experience is not passive reception but an active, reciprocal coupling between two coherence manifolds: that of the artwork and that of the observer... The dialogue is two-way. As the observer's shadow falls upon the art, the art's powerful and coherent Ki pattern is cast back, creating ripples in the observer's own manifold. This is the physical mechanism of being "moved" by art.

    excerpt: |
      The quality of the resonant dialogue can be diagnosed using the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), describing the state of the observer's consciousness. Laminar Flow (The State of Grace): The experience of a masterpiece... Turbulent Flow (The State of Struggle): The experience of art that is confusing, challenging, or unsettling... Stagnant Flow (The State of Boredom): The experience of cliché or uninspired art.

      justification: |
        The interaction is modeled as two oscillating systems (observer, artwork) influencing each other. The concepts of natural frequency (manifold's base Ki) and resonance map directly to Laminar Flow, while dissonance and beat frequencies map to Turbulent Flow. The artwork is a stable, high-Q driving oscillator (low γ₂) and the observer is an adaptive system (variable ω₁, γ₁).

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from simple 'interaction' or 'interpretation'. Resonant Dialogue implies a bidirectional, physical coupling of coherence patterns, not just a one-way cognitive analysis. The artwork acts on the observer's manifold as much as the observer's shadow acts on the artwork.

# Resonant Dialogue

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The active, reciprocal, and time-evolving coupling between the coherence manifold of an artwork (the 'coherence engine') and the coherence manifold of an observer. The artwork projects its Ki pattern, shaping the observer's perceptual flow, while the observer projects their Observer's Shadow, co-creating the work's meaning. The quality of this dialogue determines the resultant aesthetic state (e.g., Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant Flow).

## Physics-First Summary
The interaction between an observer and an artwork is modeled as a system of coupled oscillators. The artwork (`M_art`) acts as a stable, high-Q driving oscillator, while the observer (`M_obs`) is a more complex, adaptable oscillator. 'Laminar Flow' corresponds to a resonant state where `M_obs` phase-locks to `M_art`, minimizing energy dissipation and maximizing information transfer. 'Turbulent Flow' is a state of dissonance and beat frequencies, while 'Stagnant Flow' occurs when the driving amplitude is too low to overcome the observer's internal noise.
