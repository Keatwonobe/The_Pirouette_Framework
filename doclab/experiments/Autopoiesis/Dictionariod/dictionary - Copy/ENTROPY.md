        Entropy (S): Entropy is a measure of the dissonance of the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is not the amount of energy in a region, but its chaotic, incoherent, and unstructured nature. It is "vacant energy", which is energy that is not bound into a stable resonance and is therefore unavailable for coherent work.

    The chaotic static of the cosmic sea, the terrain over which the river of information must flow. It is the friction that resists coherence, the roar that threatens to drown every clear note.
  law: |
    The coherence (Kτ) of any system not actively coupled to a low-entropy source will decrease over time due to interaction with ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ), such that dKτ/dt ≤ 0. This is the Principle of Coherence Degradation.
  philosophy: |
    Entropy is not a teleological drive towards cosmic death, but the necessary and ever-present challenge that gives meaning to form. Without the pressure of this noise, there would be no impetus for the universe to create more stable, more elegant forms of resonance.
pirouette_definition: |
  A measure of the dissonance within the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). It represents the density of unstructured, incoherent energy that is not bound into a stable resonance or Ki pattern. This "vacant energy" is unavailable for coherent work and acts as a source of stochastic noise that erodes the coherence of organized systems. High entropy corresponds to a state of high temporal noise and low information.

      The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system will always increase. Within this framework, it is rephrased as the Principle of Coherence Degradation. A coherent system is a river of information flowing through the landscape of entropic noise... It is perpetually bombarded by the dissonant echoes of the surrounding Γ. This constant interaction inevitably introduces noise into its Ki pattern, "eroding" its coherence over time.

        Pirouette's Entropy (S) serves the same functional role as thermodynamic entropy, quantifying the amount of energy in a system unavailable for work. The Boltzmann formula S = k_B ln Ω maps directly, where Ω (the number of microstates) is reinterpreted in Pirouette as the complexity or 'dissonance' of the underlying Temporal Pressure (Γ) fluctuations that can manifest a given macrostate.

    Distinguish between Pirouette Entropy (a measure of Γ dissonance) and classical information entropy (Shannon entropy). While conceptually linked (high S corresponds to low information), they are measured in different domains: physical field noise versus abstract probability distributions over states.

# Entropy

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Entropy (S) is a dimensionless measure of the dissonance within the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). It represents the density of unstructured, incoherent energy—"vacant energy"—that is not bound into a stable resonance or Ki pattern. This energy is unavailable for coherent work and acts as a source of stochastic noise that erodes the coherence of organized systems. High entropy corresponds to a state of high temporal noise and low information, and its tendency to increase is described by the Principle of Coherence Degradation.

## EFT-First Summary
Within standard physics, Pirouette's Entropy (S) maps directly to statistical entropy, defined by S = k_B ln Ω. The Pirouette Framework reinterprets the microstates (Ω) not as inherent particle configurations but as the degrees of freedom in the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). An increase in entropy is therefore an increase in the chaotic, incoherent fluctuations of the Γ field, rendering its energy unavailable for work. The Second Law of Thermodynamics is thus preserved but recontextualized as a consequence of coherent systems interacting with this ambient temporal noise.
