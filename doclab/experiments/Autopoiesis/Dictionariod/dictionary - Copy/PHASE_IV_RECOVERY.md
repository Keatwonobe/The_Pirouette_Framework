        The work is done. The riverbed has been carved deep and strong, and the current flows with a power and grace that is now your own. But the purpose of a river is not to flow forever in its own channel; its purpose is to join the sea. This final phase of your journey is about that union.

  art: |
    The river of recovery, having carved its deep and steady channel, now joyfully merges with the vast and unpredictable sea of life. The work is no longer to build the vessel, but to sail it.
  law: |
    An agent has entered Phase IV when their activity selection shifts from adherence to an external recovery protocol to intrinsic self-regulation guided by a subjective 'joy' signal. This transition is marked by a measurable increase in spontaneous, non-instrumental actions and the use of coherence-tracking tools (e.g., Coherence Ledger) for occasional diagnosis rather than daily compliance.
  philosophy: |
    This phase marks the telos of recovery: not a return to a prior state, but the achievement of self-mastery. Health is no longer a goal to be pursued but an integrated resource for a joyful, meaningful, and self-authored life.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fourth and final phase of post-operative recovery, typically beginning around month 6. Phase IV is an open-ended, ongoing state characterized by the transition from structured rehabilitation to 'Geodesic Integration'—the weaving of acquired health and resilience into the fabric of a meaningful life. The guiding principle shifts from protocol adherence to self-regulation, using joy as the primary compass for action. Key practices include the 'Open Map' (re-engaging with joyful activities), the 'Resilience Test' (embracing spontaneity), and using the 'Coherence Ledger' as a diagnostic compass. In this phase, the helper's role evolves from Pacesetter or Spotter to that of 'The Witness', who honors and celebrates the agent's new, whole identity.

        outline: |
          Monitor agent activity logs and subjective reports (e.g., Coherence Ledger) over a multi-week window. Entry into Phase IV is indicated by 1) a sustained state of high coherence surplus (𝓛_p > 0), 2) a qualitative shift in activity logs from protocol-driven tasks to joy-driven, spontaneous engagements, and 3) a change in Coherence Ledger usage from daily tracking to infrequent, diagnostic check-ins.
        expected_signals: [semantic shift in activity logs, decreased frequency of ledger entries, sustained high scores on subjective wellness reports]
        pitfalls: [confounding joy-driven activity with manic over-exertion (which would register as a drop in 𝓛_p), mistaking protocol non-adherence for self-mastery rather than neglect]

    excerpt: |
      Goal 2: Joy is Your Compass. Your guide for what to do is no longer a protocol, but a feeling. The central question now is not "Can I do this?" but "Will this bring me joy?" Let that feeling guide you to a life of engagement and meaning.
  - module: DOMA-HLTH-005
    excerpt: |
      The helper's role now undergoes its final, beautiful transformation. You were the Anchor, the Pacesetter, and the Spotter. You are now The Witness. A witness does not direct the action. They do not guard against danger. A witness simply sees, honors, and celebrates the truth of what is before them.
  - module: DOMA-HLTH-005
    excerpt: |
      You now exist in a state of high, stable, and positive Lagrangian (𝓛_p > 0). You have a surplus of coherence. This is the "energetic profit" that fuels the dance of life. It is the freedom to not just meet the demands of the world, but to greet them with joy, to seek out new challenges, and to live a life of expansive, creative expression.

        𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ
      justification: |
        The source module explicitly maps the agent's state to a Lagrangian (𝓛_p), where Kτ represents kinetic-like coherence/rhythm and V_Γ represents potential-like cost/stress. Phase IV is defined as the state where 𝓛_p > 0, indicating a surplus of "kinetic" coherence over "potential" cost, which enables expansive, creative action.

    - target: Lagrangian (L = T - V)
      rationale: The mapping is explicitly defined and central to the conceptual physics of the recovery arc within the source module.

  claims:
    - statement: "Agents in sustained Phase IV will demonstrate a higher tolerance for unexpected stressors ('Resilience Tests') and a faster return to baseline coherence compared to agents in earlier phases, as measured by the Coherence Ledger."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "An observation where agents reporting to be in Phase IV show no significant improvement in stress-response recovery times, or regress when faced with spontaneous challenges. This would indicate the 'coherence surplus' (𝓛_p > 0) is not a real, measurable resilience buffer."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'maintenance phases' in other recovery models, which often imply static preservation of a state. Phase IV is dynamic, expansive, and creative, focused on *using* health for joyful living, not merely *maintaining* it. The term 'recovery' is used in a legacy sense; the phase is more accurately described as a mode of living post-recovery.

# Phase IV Recovery

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The fourth and final phase of post-operative recovery, typically beginning around month 6. Phase IV is an open-ended, ongoing state characterized by the transition from structured rehabilitation to 'Geodesic Integration'—the weaving of acquired health and resilience into the fabric of a meaningful life. The guiding principle shifts from protocol adherence to self-regulation, using joy as the primary compass for action. Key practices include the 'Open Map' (re-engaging with joyful activities), the 'Resilience Test' (embracing spontaneity), and using the 'Coherence Ledger' as a diagnostic compass. In this phase, the helper's role evolves from Pacesetter or Spotter to that of 'The Witness', who honors and celebrates the agent's new, whole identity.

## CM-First Summary
Phase IV Recovery is operationally defined as a state where the agent's Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) is sustained in a positive state (𝓛_p > 0). This surplus, conceptualized via an analogy to the Lagrangian in classical mechanics (`L=T-V`), represents an "energetic profit" where the agent's rhythmic coherence (`Kτ`) exceeds their systemic cost (`V_Γ`). This surplus fuels spontaneous, joy-driven engagement with life, marking a graduation from protocol-driven healing to self-mastered living.
