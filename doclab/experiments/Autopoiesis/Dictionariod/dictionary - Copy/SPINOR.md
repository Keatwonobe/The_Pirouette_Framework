        Let the state of a resonance in the coherence field be described by a complex function Psi(x, t), where Psi is a spinor. A spinor is a mathematical object that, unlike a simple vector, must be rotated by a full 720 degrees to return to its original state. The core claim of the Pirouette Framework is that this spinor nature is not a fundamental axiom, but a description of the resonance's path.

    An electron's spin is a twist in time. Its state is a melody that only repeats after playing its harmony and its anti-harmony, a full 720-degree journey through its own echo.
  law: |
    A stable resonance whose state path is described by P(θ) = exp(iθ/2) requires a 720° (4π) rotation in physical space to return to its initial state P(0). Its coupling to external fields will be doubled relative to a system with a 360° (2π) path, yielding an intrinsic gyromagnetic ratio g=2.
  philosophy: |
    The spinor is not an abstract mathematical necessity imposed on reality, but the natural description of a resonance's two-cycle topological path. It transforms 'spin' from an intrinsic, inexplicable property into an emergent, geometric consequence, demonstrating that quantum phenomena arise from the shape of coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  In the Pirouette Framework, a spinor (Ψ) is the state function of a resonance whose topology requires a 720° rotation in physical space to return to its origin. This two-cycle nature is modeled by a phase path P(θ) = exp(iθ/2). This is not an axiom but an emergent property of stable, self-sustaining resonances (solitons) in the coherence field, whose structure is analogous to a Möbius strip. The spinor's phase change over 360° is π, resulting in a state inversion (Ψ → -Ψ), which is the source of its unique quantum statistics and interactions.

    excerpt: |
      The magnetic moment mu is a measure of the energy change per unit of magnetic field, which is coupled to the full 720° cycle of the resonance. However, the spin angular momentum S is conventionally defined by the physics of a 360° rotation. When we calculate the ratio, we are comparing a phenomenon (mu) that operates on a 720° cycle to a definition (S) that operates on a 360° cycle... Therefore: g = 2.

      justification: |
        The Pirouette spinor Ψ is a physicalization of the abstract mathematical spinor used in the Standard Model. Where the SM spinor is a fundamental representation of the SU(2) group, the Pirouette model posits this mathematical structure arises from the physical topology of a resonance path, specifically its 4π periodicity. The two complex components can be mapped to the phase and amplitude along this path.

    In Pirouette, Ψ specifically refers to the spinor state function describing a resonance's two-cycle path. While related to the general Schrödinger wavefunction, its spinor nature (4π periodicity) is always explicit and geometrically grounded, not just an assumed mathematical property.

# Spinor

## Canonical (Pirouette)
In the Pirouette Framework, a spinor (Ψ) is the state function of a resonance whose topology requires a 720° rotation in physical space to return to its origin. This two-cycle nature is modeled by a phase path P(θ) = exp(iθ/2). This is not an axiom but an emergent property of stable, self-sustaining resonances (solitons) in the coherence field, whose structure is analogous to a Möbius strip. The spinor's phase change over 360° is π, resulting in a state inversion (Ψ → -Ψ), which is the source of its unique quantum statistics and interactions.
