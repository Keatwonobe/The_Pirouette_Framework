        SR-4 — Constitutive Elasticity
        Quadratic response of phase/pressure gradients defines an effective metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\).

  art: |
    Spacetime is not a pre-existing stage but the elastic fabric of the temporal medium itself. Its curvature is the strain, its geodesics the lines of least resistance, and its vibrations are gravitational waves rippling through the weave of cosmic coherence.
  law: |
    The effective spacetime metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\) is the inverse of the temporal medium's stiffness tensor \(\mathcal{K}^{\mu\nu}\), which quantifies the quadratic energy cost of phase (\(\theta\)) and pressure (\(\Gamma\)) gradients. All matter couples universally to this metric, enforcing the Equivalence Principle as an axiom-derived theorem.
  philosophy: |
    This principle re-frames gravity from a fundamental force to an emergent, thermodynamic property of the underlying substrate. It grounds the geometry of spacetime in the material properties of the temporal medium, making General Relativity an inevitable low-energy effective theory of its hydrodynamics.
pirouette_definition: |
  Constitutive Elasticity (SR-4) is the Pirouette axiom stating that the Lorentzian metric of spacetime, \(g_{\mu\nu}\), is not fundamental but emerges as the constitutive relation of the temporal medium. Specifically, \(g_{\mu\nu}\) is defined as being proportional to the inverse of the medium's stiffness tensor, \(\mathcal{K}^{\mu\nu}\), which describes the quadratic energy response to gradients in the substrate's phase \(\theta\) and temporal pressure \(\Gamma\). This emergence ensures that all matter and energy, being excitations of the medium, couple universally to the same geometry, thus deriving the Equivalence Principle from first principles.

          Measure the speed and polarization content of gravitational waves from high-frequency astrophysical sources (e.g., binary mergers) using a network of interferometers. The theory predicts exactly two tensor polarizations propagating at the luminal speed \(c\), with negligible dispersion below \(\omega_c\).

      Metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\) is the inverse response tensor of the temporal medium: \( g_{\mu\nu}\propto (\mathcal{K}^{-1})_{\mu\nu} \). Coarse-graining yields the effective action
      \[
      S_{\rm eff}=\!\int\! d^4x\sqrt{-g}
      \left[\frac{c^4}{16\pi G_{\rm eff}}R-\Lambda_{\rm Pirouette}
      +\mathcal{L}_{\rm matter}(g,\text{fields})\right]
      +\mathcal{O}(R^2,\nabla R).
      \]
      Varying gives Einstein’s equations. The single metric enforces the equivalence principle, with Post-Newtonian parameters β = γ = 1 on any Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM).

      If particles are knots in time and forces are how those knots keep clocks in step, then spacetime is the loom—the elastic weave of coherence they all move through.

        In analogue gravity, the effective metric experienced by phonons (sound waves) is determined by the properties (density, flow velocity) of the underlying fluid medium. This is a direct conceptual parallel to Pirouette's temporal medium defining the metric for all fields. It provides a concrete, experimentally realized example of geometry emerging from substrate dynamics.

    In Pirouette, this term is specific to the *origin* of the spacetime metric itself, not the response of fields *within* that spacetime. It is the constitution of spacetime from the substrate, analogous to how Hooke's Law is the constitutive relation for a spring's elasticity.

# Constitutive Elasticity

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Constitutive Elasticity (SR-4) is the Pirouette axiom stating that the Lorentzian metric of spacetime, \(g_{\mu\nu}\), is not fundamental but emerges as the constitutive relation of the temporal medium. Specifically, \(g_{\mu\nu}\) is defined as being proportional to the inverse of the medium's stiffness tensor, \(\mathcal{K}^{\mu\nu}\), which describes the quadratic energy response to gradients in the substrate's phase \(\theta\) and temporal pressure \(\Gamma\). This emergence ensures that all matter and energy, being excitations of the medium, couple universally to the same geometry, thus deriving the Equivalence Principle from first principles.

## EFT-First Summary
Constitutive Elasticity provides the microscopic origin for the Einstein-Hilbert action. The metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\) is not a fundamental field but the inverse stiffness tensor of the underlying temporal medium. This naturally yields General Relativity as the low-energy hydrodynamic theory of the substrate, with the Equivalence Principle as a built-in consequence of universal coupling. This formalism is conceptually parallel to analogue gravity models in condensed matter physics.
