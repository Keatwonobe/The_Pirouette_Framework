        The Internal Dividend (Maximizing K_œÑ): This is the reward for self-cultivation. It is the dividend paid for clarifying a thought, healing an internal dissonance, or mastering a skill.

  art: |
    The quiet wealth earned by tuning one's own instrument. The music of existence becomes clearer and more effortless, played from a place of inner harmony.
  law: |
    An increase in a system's internal order, measured as its Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ), directly contributes a positive term to its total Coherence Dividend (C_D), independent of direct environmental interaction. This gain is quantifiable and represents an increase in the system's dynamic efficiency and resilience.
  philosophy: |
    Internal order is not a moral virtue but a physical asset. By grounding self-interest in the measurable optimization of internal dynamics, it establishes the necessary precondition for any effective engagement with the external world and the foundation for Resonant Altruism.
pirouette_definition: |
  The component of the Coherence Dividend (C_D) derived from the maximization of a system's own Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ). This dividend is earned through actions that increase internal clarity, integrity, and efficiency, such as healing dissonance, mastering a skill, or refining an internal model. It represents the system's gain in resilience and operational grace from its own self-cultivation, forming the "selfish" but necessary basis for higher-order strategies.

        outline: |
          1. Define key performance indicators (KPIs) for the system's core function.
          2. Measure the variance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of these KPIs over time under stable conditions.
          3. Introduce controlled perturbations and measure the system's recovery time to baseline (resilience metric).
          4. An increase in SNR and a decrease in recovery time signify a positive accrual of the Internal Dividend.
        expected_signals: [Decreased output variance, faster damping of oscillations post-perturbation, increased information-theoretic efficiency of outputs.]
        pitfalls: [Conflating rigidity with stability; mistaking a reduction in functional complexity for an increase in clarity.]

    excerpt: |
      **The Internal Dividend (Maximizing K_œÑ):** This is the reward for self-cultivation. It is the dividend paid for clarifying a thought, healing an internal dissonance, or mastering a skill. By increasing its own internal order, a system makes its own existence more efficient and resilient. This is the physics of integrity, focus, and self-interest.
  - module: DOMA-042
    excerpt: |
      A "selfish" act, defined as one that seeks to maximize its own K_œÑ by externalizing cost and thus increasing the ambient V_Œì for others, is a fool's bargain. It is like shouting in a library to better hear the sound of one's own voice; a momentary, local victory is achieved by making the entire environment hostile to the desired activity.

      justification: |
        The Internal Dividend is earned by increasing K_œÑ, representing the system's internal order, clarity, and stability. This is conceptually analogous to a decrease in the system's internal Shannon entropy (S_internal), representing a move towards a more organized, predictable, and informationally efficient microstate configuration.

    - statement: "A system can sustainably increase its Internal Dividend in perfect isolation, without any energy or information exchange with its environment."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "This would violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Increasing internal order (decreasing entropy) requires either expending internal energy reserves or drawing negentropy from an external source. Therefore, earning an Internal Dividend must have an associated cost, which is accounted for within the full Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì)."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the *External Dividend*, which is gained by reducing environmental friction (V_Œì). The Internal Dividend is exclusively about improving the system's *own* state. While a necessary component of systemic health, focusing on it to the exclusion of the External Dividend leads to the "fool's bargain" of myopic selfishness.
