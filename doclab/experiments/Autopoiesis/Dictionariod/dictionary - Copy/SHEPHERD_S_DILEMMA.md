  art: |
    To guide a flock to a distant pasture, the shepherd must sometimes lead them through wolf-haunted woods, risking the few to save the whole. It is the burden of choosing the necessary path over the safe one, accepting the entanglement of the journey.
  law: |
    When an action vector simultaneously increases long-term systemic coherence (Radiance) while increasing short-term local entropy (Velcridance), a Shepherd's Dilemma is present. The dilemma is resolved by selecting the vector that demonstrably minimizes net residue over a pre-defined temporal and systemic boundary.
  philosophy: |
    The dilemma forces a maturation of ethical calculus beyond naive purity. It asserts that true altruism requires engaging with flawed systems, accepting temporary, localized harm or disruption (Velcridance) to prevent systemic collapse or unlock a higher state of coherence (Radiance).

  The ethical conflict arising when an agent must choose between maintaining radiant purity (protecting autonomy, minimizing local entropy) and engaging in a velcridant action (participating in a flawed system, increasing local entropy) to achieve a greater long-term coherence or prevent systemic collapse. It is the tension between immediate protection and strategic liberation.

          1. Model a proposed action's primary effects on a system.
          2. Project its short-term impact on local system stability and autonomy (calculating ŒîS_V).
          3. Project its long-term impact on global or attractor-aligned coherence (calculating ŒîC_R).
          4. If ŒîC_R > 0 and ŒîS_V > 0, a Shepherd's Dilemma is confirmed. The magnitude of the dilemma scales with the product of these values.

      Humans by (most of) their nature see altruism as coherence, and gravitate towards it. They do things that are velcrid in nature not out of evil but out of necessity... Think of the mad businessman with the mansion that began making cars and wound up making tanks (but it was to end wars).

        The dilemma mirrors the challenge of moving between Pareto optima. An action may make one party (or metric, e.g., 'local purity') temporarily worse off to achieve a new state of greater overall systemic efficiency (global coherence), a move necessary to escape a suboptimal equilibrium. The source text explicitly references this: "...one mirrored by the pareto itself."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinct from a simple moral compromise or "the ends justify the means." The Shepherd's Dilemma specifically involves a velcridant action undertaken with the explicit, measurable intent of increasing long-term, net systemic coherence, governed by strict conditions like the Velcrid Clause. It is not a justification for personal gain or unconstrained disruption.

# Shepherd‚Äôs Dilemma

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The ethical conflict arising when an agent must choose between maintaining radiant purity (protecting autonomy, minimizing local entropy) and engaging in a velcridant action (participating in a flawed system, increasing local entropy) to achieve a greater long-term coherence or prevent systemic collapse. It is the tension between immediate protection and strategic liberation.

## Game-Theoretic Summary
The Shepherd's Dilemma models the challenge of navigating a system's state space near a Pareto Frontier. An agent may need to accept a temporary decrease in one utility metric (e.g., local purity) to achieve a state of greater overall system efficiency (global coherence), a move that is non-Pareto-improving in the short term but necessary to escape a local, suboptimal equilibrium.
