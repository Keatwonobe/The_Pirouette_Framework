        **Stabilization (The Settling Echoes):** The new Laminar Flow is established. The system settles into its new equilibrium, but the echoes of the transition remain. It may oscillate or "ring" around its new stable state, like a struck bell finding its fundamental note.

    A struck bell does not instantly find silence, but sings its own note, the sound fading as the memory of the strike is absorbed into its being. This is the integration of the scar into a new, stable song.
  law: |
    Following the Acceleration phase, a system's residual kinetic energy is dissipated as exponentially decaying oscillations (δKₛ) around its new equilibrium resonant pattern (Ki'). The rate of change of the system's Temporal Coherence (Kτ) approaches zero as the amplitude of these oscillations falls below the intrinsic noise floor of the new state.
  philosophy: |
    Stability is not a static endpoint but a dynamic equilibrium earned through the integration of disruption. Stabilization demonstrates that recovery is incomplete until the trauma's echoes are woven into the system's new identity, turning a wound from a source of chaos into a feature of the new coherent landscape.
pirouette_definition: |
  The third and final temporal phase of systemic recovery, following Acceleration. In this phase, the system has established a new state of Laminar Flow and settles into its new stable resonant pattern (Ki'). Stabilization is characterized by damped oscillations (δKₛ), or "ringdown," around this new equilibrium as the system dissipates residual energy from its rapid recoherence and the geometric memory of the Wound Channel solidifies into a permanent feature of its coherence manifold. The phase concludes when these oscillations decay below the system's noise threshold.

        outline: |
          1.  Establish a time-series measurement of the system's primary coherence metric or key state variables.
          2.  Identify the end of the Acceleration phase, typically marked by the peak of the recovery rate (max `dKτ/dt`).
          3.  In the subsequent time window, apply a band-pass filter to isolate oscillations from long-term drift and high-frequency noise.
          4.  Fit the filtered signal to a damped sinusoid model (`A * e^(-γₛ*t) * sin(ωt + φ)`).
          5.  The Stabilization phase is defined by the interval where this model provides a good fit, and ends when the amplitude `A * e^(-γₛ*t)` is statistically indistinguishable from the system's baseline noise.

        pitfalls: [Conflating ringdown with new, small-scale environmental perturbations, misidentifying the transition point from Acceleration, under-sampling the signal leading to aliasing.]

It may oscillate or "ring" around its new stable state, like a struck bell finding its fundamental note.

    excerpt: |
      The "overshoot" dynamics observed during the Stabilization phase are the physical manifestation of the system oscillating as it settles into the basin of attraction for its new, stable resonance. Resilience, therefore, is not a measure of a system's ability to resist change, but a measure of its efficiency in finding its new path of maximal coherence after a disruption.

        When a perturbed black hole settles, it emits gravitational waves in a "ringdown" phase characterized by quasinormal modes. These modes depend only on the final black hole's mass and spin, not the nature of the perturbation. Similarly, the Stabilization oscillations (δKₛ) are posited to be characteristic of the system's new basin of attraction (Ki'), not the specific trigger of the collapse.

        The damped harmonic oscillator provides a direct, universal, and mathematically tractable model for the core dynamic of Stabilization: a system overshooting a new potential minimum and dissipating energy through oscillations. The damping ratio (ζ) and natural frequency (ω₀) are direct analogues for the parameters governing the decay and frequency of δKₛ, making this a powerful operational mapping.

# Stabilization

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The third and final temporal phase of systemic recovery, following Acceleration. In this phase, the system has established a new state of Laminar Flow and settles into its new stable resonant pattern (Ki'). Stabilization is characterized by damped oscillations (δKₛ), or "ringdown," around this new equilibrium as the system dissipates residual energy from its rapid recoherence and the geometric memory of the Wound Channel solidifies into a permanent feature of its coherence manifold. The phase concludes when these oscillations decay below the system's noise threshold.

## Physics-First Summary
Stabilization is modeled as the ringdown phase of a perturbed system settling into a new potential minimum. The dynamics are directly analogous to a damped harmonic oscillator in classical mechanics, where the system's overshoot from the Acceleration phase is dissipated as quasi-periodic oscillations. The frequency and decay rate of these oscillations are measurable characteristics of the system's new equilibrium state and the geometry of its basin of attraction.
