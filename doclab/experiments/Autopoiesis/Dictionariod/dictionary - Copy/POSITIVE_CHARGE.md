        Positive Charge (Crest-Leading): Defined as a system whose coherence, K_œÑ, is maximized by interacting with environments of in-phase temporal rhythms. It seeks constructive interference.

  art: |
    A dance that seeks the crest of the wave, a resonator tuned to the universe's chorus. It thrives in light, finding its stability by amplifying the song of its surroundings.
  law: |
    A system with Positive Charge will move along a geodesic in the coherence manifold to maximize its temporal coherence (K_œÑ) through constructive interference with its environment. In the presence of another Positive Charge, this geodesic corresponds to a trajectory of increasing spatial separation.
  philosophy: |
    Positive Charge is not an arbitrary property but a fundamental strategy for maintaining coherence. It represents the 'extroverted' approach to stability: engaging with and amplifying the rhythms of the environment, thereby asserting its existence through resonance rather than isolation.
pirouette_definition: |
  An intrinsic asymmetry in a system's Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) that biases it toward maximizing its Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ) by seeking regions of constructive interference with in-phase environmental rhythms. This coherence-seeking behavior manifests as repulsion from like charges and attraction to opposite charges, as the system follows geodesics on the coherence manifold.

        outline: |
          Introduce a test system with known Positive Charge into a region of spacetime. Map its trajectory, which represents a geodesic on the coherence manifold. The gradient of this manifold, inferred from the system's acceleration, is proportional to the electric field (E), from which the source charge distribution can be calculated.

    excerpt: |
      Positive Charge (Crest-Leading): Defined as a system whose coherence, K_œÑ, is maximized by interacting with environments of in-phase temporal rhythms. It seeks constructive interference. This immediately explains electrostatic attraction and repulsion without invoking a force. Two positive charges, placed near each other, create an environment of intense in-phase resonance. To maximize their individual coherence, they will naturally move apart, seeking regions where that resonant pressure is lower.

    excerpt: |
      A test charge placed in this field doesn't feel a "push" or "pull." It senses a slope in the coherence manifold. The "force" it experiences is simply the consequence of it following the steepest path towards its own state of maximal coherence. It is "coherence surfing" down the gradient established by the source charge.

      justification: |
        The term describes the property of matter that gives rise to electrostatic repulsion from like charges and attraction to opposite charges, and sources an electric field. This directly corresponds to the phenomenological definition of positive electric charge in the Standard Model.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the concept of positive valence in chemistry, which is a consequence of charge, not the property itself. The alias 'Crest-Leading' is preferred in contexts where the underlying coherence dynamic is being emphasized over the emergent electrostatic effect.

# Positive Charge

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An intrinsic asymmetry in a system's Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) that biases it toward maximizing its Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ) by seeking regions of constructive interference with in-phase environmental rhythms. This coherence-seeking behavior manifests as repulsion from like charges and attraction to opposite charges, as the system follows geodesics on the coherence manifold.

## EFT-First Summary
In the Standard Model, Positive Charge is the fundamental property of matter that experiences an electrostatic force in the presence of an electromagnetic field, quantified in Coulombs. The Pirouette Framework re-derives this property not as fundamental, but as an intrinsic bias in a system's Lagrangian that compels it to maximize its temporal coherence by seeking constructive interference with its environment. This coherence-seeking drive manifests as the familiar laws of electrostatics.
