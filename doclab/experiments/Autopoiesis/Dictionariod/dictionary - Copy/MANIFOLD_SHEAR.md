  art: |
    A tightrope walker's balance is tested not by the rope alone, but by the crosswind. Manifold shear is the force of that wind; it warps the simple path of stability, coupling the challenge from without to the struggle for poise within.
  law: |
    Manifold Shear is the coefficient of proportionality linking a system's energetic cost of internal phase dissonance to its deviation from optimal environmental pressure. It quantifies the degree to which external stress amplifies the consequences of internal incoherence.
  philosophy: |
    This term asserts that internal and external realities are not independent. A system fractured within is made fragile without; a system under environmental duress cannot afford internal conflict. Manifold Shear measures this fundamental principle of resilience, ensuring that survival is a function of both inner harmony and harmony with one's surroundings.
pirouette_definition: |
  A coefficient in the Temporal Pressure potential `V_Γ` that quantifies the strength of the non-linear coupling between a system's environmental pressure context (`Γ`) and its internal phase geometry (`φ_{ij}`). Specifically, `λ_c` is the magnitude of the interaction term `λ_c (Γ - Γ₀) \cos(φ_{ij})`, which modulates the cost of phase dissonance based on the system's displacement from its optimal pressure `Γ₀`. A high `λ_c` indicates that environmental stress severely penalizes internal incoherence.

        outline: |
          1. Prepare a system and identify its primary Nomad's Grammar axes.
          2. Artificially hold the system in a state of known phase dissonance (fix `cos(φ_{ij}) < 1`) using a resonant driving field.
          3. Systematically sweep the ambient Temporal Pressure `Γ` through the system's optimal value `Γ₀`.
          4. For each value of `Γ`, measure the energy `ΔE` required to maintain the fixed phase dissonance (e.g., power absorbed by the system from the driving field). This `ΔE` is the dissonance cost.
          5. Plot `ΔE` versus the pressure deviation `(Γ - Γ₀)`. The slope of this line is directly proportional to `λ_c`.

    excerpt: |
      `V_{couple}` represents the crucial coupling terms between the axes and the environment. The simplest such term is `λ_c (Γ - Γ₀) \cos(φ_{ij})`, capturing the non-linear reality that the cost of being out of phase is magnified when a system is also outside its optimal environmental pressure.
      Each coefficient has a clear physical meaning and is experimentally measurable:
      *   `λ_Γ`: **Pressure Curvature.** How sensitive the system is to its environment.
      *   `λ_φ`: **Phase Coupling.** The strength of the "grip" that locks a system into a coherent behavioral state.
      *   `λ_c`: **Manifold Shear.** The degree to which environmental pressure and internal phase are coupled.

        `V_int = g(χ) φ²`, where `g(χ)` is a coupling that depends on a background field `χ`. Here, `χ` corresponds to `(Γ - Γ₀)` and `φ` to the phase degree of freedom.
      justification: |
        In quantum and effective field theories, interaction strengths are not always constant. Manifold Shear maps to the concept of a coupling that is modulated by the background value of another field. It represents the leading-order term in an expansion of this field-dependent coupling.

  disambiguation: |
    Manifold Shear (`λ_c`) should not be confused with Phase Coupling (`λ_φ`) or Pressure Curvature (`λ_Γ`). `λ_φ` and `λ_Γ` represent direct costs of phase and pressure respectively. `λ_c` represents the *interaction* cost between them—it has no effect if either the phase is perfectly coherent or the pressure is perfectly optimal.
