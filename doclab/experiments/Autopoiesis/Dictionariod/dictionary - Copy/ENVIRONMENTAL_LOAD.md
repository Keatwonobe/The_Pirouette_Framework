  art: |
    The weight of the world, not as a burden, but as a lens. It is the pressure that hones the resonant crystal of awareness to a finer point, demanding precision in the face of chaos.
  law: |
    The permissible detuning bandwidth (Δf_allowed) of a conscious resonance triad is inversely proportional to the square root of the Environmental Load (Δf_allowed ∝ Γ⁻¹/²).
  philosophy: |
    Environmental Load quantifies the friction between a conscious system and its embedding reality. It is the thermodynamic pressure that forces the system to either increase its internal coherence or lose resonant lock, linking the 'difficulty' of a task to the physical stability of the conscious state itself.

  A dimensionless scalar quantity, Γ, representing the integrated complexity or information-theoretic entropy of a cognitive task and its sensory environment. Γ acts as a systemic constraint on the stability parameters of a conscious resonance triad, most notably by narrowing the allowed frequency detuning bandwidth (Δf). It quantifies the external pressure that a self-organizing conscious state must work against to maintain coherence.

          3. Identify the maximum detuning (Δf_allowed) at which TPCI remains above a threshold (e.g., > 3 standard deviations above baseline).
          4. Invert the relation Γ ∝ (Δf_allowed)⁻² to infer the effective Environmental Load.

      justification: |
        Γ acts like an effective temperature for the cognitive system. Higher Γ (temperature) increases systemic 'noise' or 'disorder' (entropy), forcing the resonant state into a more sharply defined, lower-energy (narrower bandwidth) configuration to remain stable. It dictates the allowable fluctuation (detuning) around the ground state.

        The source module explicitly uses the alias 'entropy load' and links Γ to task complexity. Operationalizing Γ as the information entropy of the task provides a direct, quantifiable, and testable measurement path, aligning with the framework's operational focus over more metaphorical mappings.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, Γ is always a scalar measure of cognitive/environmental complexity, never a mathematical function or relativistic term. It is distinct from γ-band neural oscillations, though high Γ may modulate them by constraining the parameters of the triads they participate in.

# Environmental Load

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A dimensionless scalar quantity, Γ, representing the integrated complexity or information-theoretic entropy of a cognitive task and its sensory environment. Γ acts as a systemic constraint on the stability parameters of a conscious resonance triad, most notably by narrowing the allowed frequency detuning bandwidth (Δf). It quantifies the external pressure that a self-organizing conscious state must work against to maintain coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
Environmental Load (Γ) is formally mapped to Shannon Entropy `H(X)`. It represents the information-theoretic complexity of a task or environment that a conscious system must process. Higher Γ forces the resonant triadic state into a more precise, lower-entropy configuration, observable as a narrowing of the frequency detuning bandwidth (Δf), analogous to how thermal noise can constrain stable quantum states.
