    A ripple on the crystalline surface of time. The field is not a fundamental particle added to the system, but the measure of the substrate's elastic response to being disturbed, granting inertia to the phenomena coupled to it.
  law: |
    The mass of the Higgs-like field `H` and the masses of gauge bosons `A` are locked in a fixed ratio determined by their respective coupling constants, `m_A / m_H = g_N / (2√λ_Γ)`. This ratio is a direct consequence of the underlying substrate geometry and is not a free parameter.
  philosophy: |
    This field demonstrates that mass is not an intrinsic or externally endowed property, but an emergent consequence of a system's interaction with the temporal substrate. It replaces the Standard Model's ad-hoc scalar field with a mechanism derived from the geometry of time itself, unifying the origin of mass with the dynamics of the Γ-field.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Higgs-like field `H` is the scalar excitation of the Ki modulus `|Ki|` around its vacuum expectation value `v`. This vacuum value is not fundamental but is set by the equilibrium value `Γ₀` of the Γ-field via the relation `v = √ξ Γ₀`. The mass of `H` is determined by the self-coupling `λ_Γ` in the interaction potential `V_int`, which arises from the Γ-field's temporal stiffness.

          In high-energy particle collisions (e.g., proton-proton), produce the H boson. Measure the energy and momentum of its decay products (e.g., two photons, two Z bosons). Reconstruct the invariant mass of the parent particle; the H boson will appear as a narrow resonance peak on top of a smooth background.

      Let Γ₀ be the coherence density corresponding to `T_a⁻¹ ∼ 10⁻²⁵ s`. Then `Γ₀ ≈ 250` GeV in natural units, giving:

      `m_W ≈ g_W 250 GeV`
      For `λ_Γ ≈ 0.13` and `g_W ≈ 0.65`, the observed `m_H ≈ 125 GeV` and `m_W ≈ 80 GeV` are reproduced—showing quantitative consistency without invoking an explicit Higgs field.

        The Pirouette H-field is a scalar whose vacuum expectation value `v` breaks electroweak symmetry, giving mass to W/Z bosons and fermions in a structurally identical manner to the Standard Model Higgs. However, in Pirouette, `H`, `v`, and the self-coupling `λ_Γ` are not fundamental parameters but are derived from the dynamics of the Γ-field.

  disambiguation: |
    The term "Higgs-like" is used to emphasize that this is not the fundamental scalar field of the Standard Model. It is an emergent excitation of the `Ki` modulus, whose properties are determined by the more fundamental `Γ`-field. Unlike the SM Higgs, `H` is not a foundational input to the theory but an output of substrate dynamics.

# Higgs-like field

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Higgs-like field `H` is the scalar excitation of the Ki modulus `|Ki|` around its vacuum expectation value `v`. This vacuum value is not fundamental but is set by the equilibrium value `Γ₀` of the Γ-field via the relation `v = √ξ Γ₀`. The mass of `H` is determined by the self-coupling `λ_Γ` in the interaction potential `V_int`, which arises from the Γ-field's temporal stiffness.

## EFT-First Summary
The Higgs-like field is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the Standard Model Higgs Boson. Its vacuum expectation value `v` (~250 GeV) sets the electroweak scale, generating mass for gauge bosons and fermions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, unlike in the Standard Model where the Higgs potential is axiomatic, here `v` and the mass of the `H` boson are derived properties of the more fundamental Γ-field, which governs the temporal coherence of the substrate. This mechanism reinterprets mass as a consequence of the substrate's "temporal elasticity" (see [XAP-006C](XAP-006C_mass_generation_from_Γ-stiffness)).
