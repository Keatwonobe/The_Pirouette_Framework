        1) Background-Field Method (BFM) Derivation (Sketched)
        1. Setup: Introduce a classical background (A_μ) and quantum photon (a_μ) with (A_μ = A_μ + a_μ). Background gauge fixing preserves Ward identities.
        2. 1PI vertex: The Pauli term coefficient (F_2(0)) is extracted from the background 1PI two-point function with one insertion of (F_μν).

    To see the dance, one must first steady the stage. The background field provides a fixed, classical backdrop against which the quantum fluctuations perform, their coordinated movements preserving the symphony of symmetry.
  law: |
    By splitting a gauge field `A_μ` into a classical background `A_μ` and a quantum fluctuation `a_μ`, and choosing a gauge fixing that is covariant with respect to `A_μ`, all one-particle-irreducible (1PI) Green's functions will satisfy the simple, linear Ward-Takahashi identities of the background field.
  philosophy: |
    The BFM is a philosophical choice to privilege symmetry. It asserts that the essential structure of a theory (its gauge invariance) should not be an accidental casualty of calculation, but the very scaffolding upon which the calculation is built, simplifying complexity and revealing geometric analogues.
pirouette_definition: |
  A computational technique for quantum field theory that splits a gauge field into a classical, non-dynamical background part (`A_μ`) and a quantum fluctuation (`a_μ`). Gauge fixing is performed only on the quantum field in a way that remains covariant under gauge transformations of the background field. This procedure ensures that effective actions and Green's functions manifestly satisfy the gauge symmetries (Ward identities) of the classical background, simplifying renormalization and revealing direct mappings to geometric concepts like the curvature of a particle's 'wound-channel'.

        outline: |
          1. Decompose the photon field: `A_μ = A_μ + a_μ`.
          2. Add a background-covariant gauge-fixing term to the Lagrangian (e.g., `(D_μ[A]a^μ)^2`).
          3. Calculate the one-particle-irreducible (1PI) electron-electron-background-photon vertex function `Γ^μ(p,q; A)`.
          4. Extract the coefficient of the Pauli term `σ^{μν}F_{μν}` at zero momentum transfer (`q→0`) to find the form factor `F_2(0)`.
          5. Apply on-shell renormalization conditions to cancel divergences and fix counterterms. The result is a finite, gauge-invariant physical quantity.

          - A finite, gauge-invariant value for the two-loop coefficient `C₂ ≈ +0.328478965...`, matching results from independent methods like the worldline formalism.
        pitfalls:
          - Failure to maintain background covariance in all terms, including ghosts and counterterms.
          - Incorrect implementation of on-shell renormalization scheme, leading to residual gauge dependence or incorrect finite parts.
          - Sign errors arising from inconsistent metric or gamma-matrix conventions.

        The Pirouette BFM is identical to the standard textbook method used in quantum field theory for gauge theories. It separates fields to maintain manifest gauge invariance for the effective action, simplifying proofs of renormalizability and high-order calculations. Its use in Pirouette is to provide a concrete computational link from Feynman diagrams to geometric interpretations.

  disambiguation: |
    The BFM should not be confused with Effective Field Theory (EFT). In EFT, high-energy fields are integrated out, leaving a low-energy theory of different fields. In BFM, the background field is a classical component of the *same* field being quantized, used as a computational device to preserve symmetry.

# Background-Field Method

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A computational technique for quantum field theory that splits a gauge field into a classical, non-dynamical background part (`A_μ`) and a quantum fluctuation (`a_μ`). Gauge fixing is performed only on the quantum field in a way that remains covariant under gauge transformations of the background field. This procedure ensures that effective actions and Green's functions manifestly satisfy the gauge symmetries (Ward identities) of the classical background, simplifying renormalization and revealing direct mappings to geometric concepts like the curvature of a particle's 'wound-channel'.

## EFT-First Summary
The Background-Field Method is a standard QFT technique for calculating quantum corrections while preserving manifest gauge invariance, established by DeWitt, 't Hooft, and Veltman. By splitting a field like the photon into a classical background and a quantum part, it simplifies Ward identities and renormalization, making it the preferred tool for high-order calculations in QED and QCD. Its application in Pirouette serves as the primary computational bridge between Feynman diagrams and the geometric picture of particle worldtubes.
