  art: |
    An idea's strength is not in its volume but its elegant shape. A truth resonates with itself, a harmonious braid holding its form through time; a falsehood is a tangled knot, perpetually at war with its own structure.
  law: |
    A *Ki* pattern's Resonant Stability (K_τ) is proportional to the mean temporal half-life of its defining geometric invariants under ambient Temporal Pressure. Patterns with K_τ approaching 1 are self-sustaining; those with K_τ approaching 0 are dissipative and require continuous external coherence to maintain.
  philosophy: |
    This metric operationalizes the intuition that truth possesses an intrinsic harmony. By quantifying a concept's self-consistency as a geometric property, Resonant Stability shifts the locus of validation from external authority to the internal, measurable integrity of the idea itself. It posits that a 'good' idea is one that is structurally sound enough to survive.
pirouette_definition: |
  Resonant Stability (K_τ) is a dimensionless metric that quantifies the internal structural integrity and self-consistency of a concept, modeled as a resonant *Ki* pattern. It measures the pattern's ability to sustain its own geometry over time without collapsing into dissonance. Qualitatively, it is described by the concept's *Ki* Topology, where high K_τ corresponds to simple, harmonious braids and low K_τ corresponds to chaotic, tangled knots.

      A "true," "elegant," or "useful" idea is a high-coherence *Ki* pattern. It is stable, internally consistent, and harmonizes with the established **Wound Channels** of memory and recorded events. It is a pattern the universe finds "easy" to sustain... A "false," "confusing," or contradictory idea is a low-coherence, turbulent *Ki* pattern. It is inherently unstable, requiring immense and continuous effort to prevent its collapse.

      justification: |
        Resonant Stability measures the intrinsic lifetime of a conceptual pattern. In quantum field theory, a resonance is an unstable particle with a finite lifetime, characterized by a decay width (Γ) in its energy spectrum. A lower decay width implies a longer lifetime and greater stability. K_τ is analogous to a normalized lifetime, where a stable concept is a long-lived particle and an unstable one is a broad, short-lived resonance.

    K_τ should not be confused with kinetic energy. Here, 'K' is a stability constant, and the subscript τ denotes its temporal nature, relating it to the concept's characteristic lifetime. It is a measure of potential stability, not motional energy.

# Resonant Stability

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Resonant Stability (K_τ) is a dimensionless metric that quantifies the internal structural integrity and self-consistency of a concept, modeled as a resonant *Ki* pattern. It measures the pattern's ability to sustain its own geometry over time without collapsing into dissonance. Qualitatively, it is described by the concept's *Ki* Topology, where high K_τ corresponds to simple, harmonious braids and low K_τ corresponds to chaotic, tangled knots.

## EFT-First Summary
No formal mapping has been adopted. A promising candidate analogizes Resonant Stability to the lifetime of a resonance or quasi-particle in quantum field theory. In this view, K_τ is proportional to the inverse of the concept's "decay width," where a stable, long-lived idea is like a particle with a narrow energy distribution, and an unstable idea is like a broad, short-lived resonance that quickly dissipates.
