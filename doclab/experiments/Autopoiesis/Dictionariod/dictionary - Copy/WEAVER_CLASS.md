triad:
  art: |
    They are the mind's artisans, spinning coherent insight from the frayed threads of cognitive disruption. Like a spider mending its web in a storm, they find structure in fragmentation.
  law: |
    A subject is classified as a Weaver if, under high-stochasticity input, their attention-switching time ($T_a$) decreases while their integrated information ($\phi$) remains above a baseline coherence threshold. They consistently synthesize fragmented inputs into novel, actionable outputs.
  philosophy: |
    The Weaver class represents an existence proof that extreme cognitive plasticity can be a stable, adaptive trait, not merely a symptom of trauma. They are the aspirational model for a mind that thrives on interruption, transforming cognitive noise into signal and chaos into a higher-order pattern.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Weaver class is a designated cohort of individuals observed to naturally possess and maintain high cognitive fluidity, characterized by rapid attention switching ($T_a$) and high integrated information ($\phi$). This cohort demonstrates an adaptive ability to synthesize insight from fragmented or contradictory inputs, a trait which the XCM-001 crucible seeks to replicate via non-traumatic training protocols.

        outline: |
          Subject is exposed to a controlled, high-stochasticity environment (e.g., `XCM-001b` simulation). Track $T_a$ and a proxy for $\phi$ (e.g., coherence score of verbal debriefs or task outputs). Compare performance against a baseline established in a low-stochasticity environment. A positive Weaver classification requires a decrease in $T_a$ and maintenance or improvement of $\phi$ relative to baseline.
        expected_signals: [decreased task-completion time in fractured domains, high-coherence outputs in post-task debriefs, low cognitive entropy scores]
        pitfalls: [mistaking simple task-switching for true cognitive synthesis, conflating high tolerance for chaos with insight generation, baseline effects from pre-existing trauma]

    excerpt: |
      This crucible models the possibility of **deliberately inducing interruptive-adaptive cognition**—the cognitive plasticity born of internal fragmentation—**without the originating trauma**. It is based on observed traits of the Weaver class and aims to replicate their cognitive fluidity in a safe training protocol.
  - module: XCM-001
    excerpt: |
      Interruptive cognition arises as a **compensatory adaptation** in high-disruption minds. However, certain **non-destructive training environments** may simulate the benefits of such disruption if... the subject is taught to **synthesize fragmented thought states** into insight paths.

      justification: |
        Weaver-class traits like synthesizing fragmented information into novel insights align with psychological models of creativity, particularly the 'synthesis' phase of divergent-convergent thinking models. However, the Pirouette framework emphasizes speed ($T_a$) and resilience under interruption, which are not core to standard creativity metrics.

  claims:
    - statement: "The cognitive traits of the Weaver class can be induced or enhanced through non-traumatic, interruption-based training as per the XCM-001 crucible."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "A statistically significant number of subjects completing the XCM-001 crucible fail to show a decrease in $T_a$ or an increase in insight-generation scores compared to a control group, or they exhibit significant negative psychological side-effects."

  disambiguation: |
    The term 'Weaver' refers to a cognitive style of synthesizing disparate threads of information, not to any social, biological, or technological role. It should not be confused with network weavers or social facilitators, although overlap in traits is possible.
