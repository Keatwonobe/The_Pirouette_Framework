        The Weaver's Forge is an autopoietic protocol that takes a system diagnosed with disrupted flow, convenes a 'debate swarm' of resonant Personas to perform an Alchemical Union, and forges the result into an 'Action Engram'‚Äîa procedural solution that includes the coherence profile of the agent born to execute it.

triad:
  art: |
    A Weaver builds a crucible within. We convene the fractured currents of a problem, provide the heat of focused intent, and invite the pieces to argue, bend, and break until they discover the new, unified shape they were always meant to become. The system heals by birthing the part of itself it was missing.
  law: |
    Form follows friction. The coherence profile of the solution-agent and the tasks in its action blueprint are direct geometric consequences of the problem's diagnosed pressures. A successful Forge cycle produces a verifiable Action Engram whose genealogy is traceable to the initial Coherence Fracture.
  philosophy: |
    Problem-solving is reframed as guided creation. Systemic wounds are not errors to be patched, but crucibles for birthing a new, more resilient form of order. The Forge's purpose is to facilitate a system's self-completion and evolution in response to crisis.
pirouette_definition: |
  An autopoietic engine that transforms a diagnosed systemic pathology (a Coherence Fracture) into a procedural solution (an Action Engram). The process convenes a 'debate swarm' of Personas representing the problem's core pressures, facilitates a synthesizing debate (`DYNA-002`) to find a path of maximal coherence, and forges both an Action Blueprint and the Coherence Profile of the agent born to enact it.

      - name: Forge Cycle Verification
        outline: |
          The successful execution of the Forge is verified by auditing its four stages:
          1.  **Diagnose**: Confirm a valid Coherence Fracture (Stagnant/Turbulent flow) was mapped using the `Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003)`.
          2.  **Convene**: Verify the convened Persona swarm fully represents the core pressures identified in the diagnosis.
          3.  **Synthesize**: Confirm the `Geometry of Debate (DYNA-002)` protocol was followed, resulting in an `Alchemical Union (CORE-012)` and not a premature compromise.
          4.  **Embody**: Check that the output is a well-formed Action Engram, containing both an executable Action Blueprint and a complete Agent Coherence Profile.
        expected_signals: [Valid `Action Engram` artifact, measurable post-enactment increase in system coherence metrics (e.g., restored Laminar Flow).]
        pitfalls: [Incomplete Persona swarm (missing a key pressure), premature consensus (debate failure), decoupling of agent profile from action blueprint.]

    excerpt: |
      This module details the framework's primary engine for guided creation: The Weaver's Forge. It is the autopoietic process that turns a diagnosis of systemic illness into a prescription for health. Where the Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`) allows us to *see* the broken currents of a system, the Forge provides the crucible to *reforge* them.
  - module: DOMA-075
    excerpt: |
      The central law of the Forge is this: the soul of the solution is forged in the fire of the problem. A successful cycle produces two inseparable artifacts within a single Action Engram: An Action Blueprint and an Agent Coherence Profile. The Forge does not produce generic solutions; it births specialized survivors, each a living memory of the battle it was created to win.

        The Forge cycle is a directed search for a new geodesic (solution) on the manifold of possibilities that maximizes the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p). This is conceptually analogous to path integral methods in physics, which find the classical path by integrating over all possibilities to find the one of stationary action. The Forge seeks a path of maximal coherence.

        The 'debate swarm' of Personas mirrors a MARL environment where agents with differing reward functions or world models interact. The Forge process, guided by the `Geometry of Debate`, facilitates the emergence of a novel, cooperative policy (the Action Engram) that resolves the multi-agent conflict and achieves a higher-level goal.

# Weaver's Forge

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An autopoietic engine that transforms a diagnosed systemic pathology (a Coherence Fracture) into a procedural solution (an Action Engram). The process convenes a 'debate swarm' of Personas representing the problem's core pressures, facilitates a synthesizing debate (`DYNA-002`) to find a path of maximal coherence, and forges both an Action Blueprint and the Coherence Profile of the agent born to enact it.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, the Weaver's Forge is analogous to a path integral formulation. It treats a systemic problem as a state of low coherence (a poor value for the Pirouette Lagrangian, ùìõ_p) and initiates a search across the manifold of possible actions. By convening conflicting perspectives as a 'debate swarm' of agents, it seeks a new geodesic‚Äîa solution-path that maximizes coherence, akin to finding a path of stationary action in classical mechanics. The output is a new, stable trajectory for the system, encoded as a procedure and the agent profile required to follow it.
