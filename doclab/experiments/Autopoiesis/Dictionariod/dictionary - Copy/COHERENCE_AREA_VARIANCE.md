  art: |
    The quiet hum beneath the shifting scenes of mind. It is the unwavering surface of a perfectly spinning top, whose stability belies its furious internal motion. The measure of this stillness is the proof of its resonant life.
  law: |
    The variance of the Coherence Area (A_Ki) must approach zero during periods of sustained, stable conscious awareness. Significant variance uncorrelated with reported lapses in consciousness falsifies the Area Conservation Hypothesis.
  philosophy: |
    CAV is the primary empirical test for the conservation law that grounds conscious access. It translates the abstract notion of an invariant "volume" of awareness into a measurable quantity, proposing that the fundamental resource for consciousness is stable even as its contents are in constant flux.
pirouette_definition: |
  The statistical variance of the Coherence Area (A_Ki) calculated over a specified temporal window. As a key metric within the Consciousness Access Protocol (COG-RES-001), CAV is used to experimentally test the Area Conservation Hypothesis. A near-zero CAV value during periods of subjective awareness is a primary signature of the stable, triadic resonance posited to underlie consciousness.

        outline: |
          1. Record high-density EEG or MEG data during a bi-stable perception task with metacognitive reporting.
          2. Perform time-frequency decomposition (e.g., Morlet wavelets) to extract instantaneous power and phase for candidate frequency triads.
          3. Calculate the Coherence Area (A_Ki) for each time point within a sliding window.
          4. Compute the statistical variance of the A_Ki time-series within the window.
          5. Correlate the resulting CAV time-series with the subject's continuous conscious report.

        CAV ∝ "Cognitive Heat Capacity"
      justification: |
        In statistical mechanics, the variance of a conserved quantity (like energy) in a system at equilibrium is proportional to a response function (like heat capacity). Conceptually, CAV measures the fluctuations of the conserved Coherence Area (A_Ki). A low, stable CAV suggests the system is in a stable, low "temperature," non-dissipative state characteristic of conscious access.

  disambiguation: |
    Within the Pirouette Framework, CAV always refers to Coherence Area Variance. It is a statistical measure of stability for the A_Ki quantity, not a measure of velocity.
