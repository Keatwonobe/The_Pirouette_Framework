        A full coherence cycle satisfies \(\oint_\tau d\theta=2\pi\).
        Coupling \(A_\mu=\partial_\mu\arg Ki\) to charge \(e\) gives
        \(\oint eA_\mu dx^\mu=e(2\pi)\).
        Thus the fundamental loop integral naturally introduces the factor \(2\pi\) and the lowest-order correction scales as \(\alpha/2\pi\).

    An internal clock whose single tick defines the fundamental unit of charge and phase. It is the rhythmic breath of a particle, turning chaos into a quantized waltz.
  law: |
    The integral of the Ki-field's phase differential, \(d\theta = d(\arg Ki)\), over one full evolution of the internal parameter τ must equal 2π. This normalization topologically constrains all U(1) couplings sourced by the Ki field.
  philosophy: |
    The Coherence Cycle replaces postulated U(1) gauge symmetry with a dynamical, geometric principle. It asserts that the quantization of charge is not an arbitrary rule but a topological necessity arising from the periodic nature of the time-substrate.

  A Coherence Cycle is the complete, 2π evolution of the Ki-field's complex phase, \(\theta = \arg Ki\), parametrized by the internal time-substrate coordinate τ. This closed loop, \(\oint_\tau d\theta = 2\pi\), serves as a fundamental topological invariant that geometrically normalizes U(1) interactions. It sources the electromagnetic potential \(A_\mu = \partial_\mu \theta\) and provides a first-principles origin for the 2π factor in quantum phase and related low-order corrections, such as the Schwinger term.

        outline: |
          Measure the electron's anomalous magnetic moment \(a_e\). The leading-order Schwinger correction term is predicted to be precisely \(\alpha/2\pi\). The \(2\pi\) factor is a direct, non-perturbative consequence of the cycle normalization. Any confirmed deviation from this specific scaling factor at the one-loop level would challenge the geometric origin proposed by the Coherence Cycle.
        expected_signals: [Measured \(a_e\) value consistent with the QED calculation containing the \(\alpha/2\pi\) term, which Pirouette derives geometrically.]
        pitfalls: [Higher-order loop corrections obscure the direct contribution; experimental and theoretical precision must be sufficient to isolate the one-loop term's coefficient.]

      For the spherical coherence manifold the eigen-energies scale as \(E_n\!\propto\!n^2-n+\tfrac14\). Minimization yields \(n=½\), corresponding to \(P(\theta)=e^{i\theta/2}\). Higher or fractional windings increase coherence strain; hence spin-½ is the dynamically selected ground state, not an imposed postulate.

        The Coherence Cycle provides a dynamical and geometric origin for the U(1) phase. Instead of being an abstract symmetry, the phase angle θ is identified with the argument of the physical Ki field, and its 2π periodicity is a topological feature of the cycle.

        The integral of the sourced potential \(A_\mu\) around a closed loop is directly tied to the topological winding of the underlying Coherence Cycle. This provides a physical interpretation for the quantized flux observed in Aharonov-Bohm phenomena.

    Distinguish from 'loop' in the context of Feynman diagrams. A Coherence Cycle is a fundamental, single traversal of an internal phase space parametrized by τ, whereas a Feynman 'loop' represents a virtual particle integration over all possible momenta. The two-loop contribution in MATH-015A is a calculation that *depends* on the Coherence Cycle's normalization; it is not the cycle itself.

# Coherence Cycle

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Coherence Cycle is the complete, 2π evolution of the Ki-field's complex phase, \(\theta = \arg Ki\), parametrized by the internal time-substrate coordinate τ. This closed loop, \(\oint_\tau d\theta = 2\pi\), serves as a fundamental topological invariant that geometrically normalizes U(1) interactions. It sources the electromagnetic potential \(A_\mu = \partial_\mu \theta\) and provides a first-principles origin for the 2π factor in quantum phase and related low-order corrections, such as the Schwinger term.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Cycle provides a geometric origin for U(1) gauge symmetry. The phase factor \(e^{i\theta}\) in quantum mechanics is identified with the phase of a physical complex field, Ki, evolving through a mandatory 2π cycle. This framing recasts charge quantization as a topological winding number and predicts that the ubiquitous 2π factor in results like the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the Schwinger term (\(a_e = \alpha/2\pi\)) is a direct consequence of this underlying periodic structure.
