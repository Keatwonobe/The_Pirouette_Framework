  art: |
    Maxwell's force came from one clock. Yang-Mills forces come from many clocks that must agree at once—a moving scaffold of temporal frames. The stiffness is the energy it costs to twist this scaffold, a resistance whose curvature is the force itself.
  law: |
    The energy density required to curve the local temporal-resonance frame is proportional to the square of the connection curvature, `F_μν F^μν`. The temporal-frame stiffness is the constant of proportionality, `1/g^2`, where `g` is the gauge coupling constant. A higher stiffness (smaller `g`) implies a stronger resistance to frame variation and a weaker long-range force.
  philosophy: |
    Temporal-frame stiffness grounds the abstract concept of a gauge coupling constant in a physical property of the Pirouette medium. It asserts that gauge forces are not fundamental axioms but emergent consequences of the medium's energetic preference for coherent, parallel temporal frames. The non-Abelian self-interaction arises directly from the geometric nature of twisting these multi-dimensional frames.
pirouette_definition: |
  The energetic cost associated with spacetime variations of the local temporal-resonance frame (e.g., the temporal triad for SU(2) or temporal-color basis for SU(3)). It is parameterized by the gauge coupling constant `g`, which acts as an inverse stiffness scale. This cost is captured by the Yang-Mills Lagrangian, `L_YM = -(1/4) F^a_μν F^{a,μν}`, which penalizes curvature `F` of the internal frame's connection. A stiffer medium (smaller `g`) more strongly resists frame deformation, leading to weaker interactions.

          1. Conduct a particle scattering experiment involving the relevant non-Abelian interaction (e.g., proton-proton collision for SU(3), electron-positron to W+W- for SU(2)).
          2. Measure the differential or total cross-section `σ` for a specific final state.
          3. Compare the measured `σ` with the theoretical prediction calculated from perturbative QCD or Electroweak theory, which is a function of the fine-structure constant `α = g^2 / 4π`.
          4. Extract the value of `α`, and therefore `g`, that makes the theoretical prediction match the experimental data at a given energy scale `μ`.

        `L_YM = -(1/4) F^a_μν F^{a,μν}` where `D_μ = ∂_μ - igA^a_μ T^a`. The Pirouette stiffness `κ` is `1/g^2`.
      justification: |
        The term is a physical re-interpretation of the gauge coupling constant `g`. In Pirouette, `1/g^2` is not just a free parameter but the physical stiffness of the medium against deforming its internal temporal frames. This provides a causal origin for the `F^2` term and its normalization, directly linking the interaction strength to a material property of the temporal medium.

  disambiguation: |
    Temporal-frame stiffness should not be confused with mechanical stiffness of a physical material. It is an effective parameter describing the energy cost for variations of an *internal* field configuration (the temporal-resonance frame) across spacetime, analogous to the gradient energy term `(∇φ)^2` for a scalar field. The "stiffness" metaphor highlights the medium's resistance to local changes in its internal basis orientation.

# Temporal-frame stiffness

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The energetic cost associated with spacetime variations of the local temporal-resonance frame (e.g., the temporal triad for SU(2) or temporal-color basis for SU(3)). It is parameterized by the gauge coupling constant `g`, which acts as an inverse stiffness scale. This cost is captured by the Yang-Mills Lagrangian, `L_YM = -(1/4) F^a_μν F^{a,μν}`, which penalizes curvature `F` of the internal frame's connection. A stiffer medium (smaller `g`) more strongly resists frame deformation, leading to weaker interactions.

## EFT-First Summary
In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), Temporal-frame stiffness maps directly to the inverse squared gauge coupling, `1/g^2`, which appears as the normalization factor for the Yang-Mills kinetic term, `-(1/4g^2) Tr[W_μν W^μν]`. This parameter determines the fundamental strength of the non-Abelian gauge interactions, such as the weak and strong nuclear forces. Its value is measured experimentally and is known to "run" with the energy scale, a behavior described by the renormalization group (cf. Peskin & Schroeder, Ch. 15-16).
