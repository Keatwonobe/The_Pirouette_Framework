  art: |
    The universe's fundamental breath, a slow exhale measured in the dimming of its electromagnetic fire. The echo of Γ's primordial rhythm fades, and with it, the strength of light's bond.
  law: |
    The logarithmic rate of change of the fine-structure constant, $\dot{\alpha}/\alpha$, is non-zero, negative, and proportional to the decay of the mean-squared temporal pressure condensate, $\langle\Gamma^2\rangle$. A measured positive or null drift at a sensitivity of $10^{-19} \text{ yr}^{-1}$ falsifies the mechanism.
  philosophy: |
    This elevates the fine-structure constant from a mere parameter to a dynamical fossil record. Its drift is not a failure of constancy but a direct, observable consequence of the cooling coherence of the temporal medium, making the history of the universe's fundamental laws physically legible.
pirouette_definition: |
  A small, negative time-variation of the fine-structure constant α, arising as a residual effect (a "tail") from the slow cosmological decay of the mean-squared temporal pressure condensate $\langle\Gamma^2\rangle$. This effect is a low-energy leakage from the dynamics governed by the coherence mass scale, $M_{\text{coh}}$, and provides a direct, albeit faint, observational window into the Γ-field's cosmic evolution. It is predicted to be negative, meaning α was slightly larger in the past.

        outline: |
          Compare fine-structure splitting of absorption lines (e.g., Si IV, Mg II) from distant quasars with laboratory values. The redshift `z` acts as a lookback time proxy, allowing for a measurement of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ over billions of years.
        expected_signals: [A small, negative trend in $\alpha$ with lookback time (i.e., $\alpha$ was slightly larger in the past).]
        pitfalls: [Systematic errors in astrophysical line identification and fitting; potential chemical or isotopic evolution mimicking the signal.]

        outline: |
          Monitor the frequency ratio of two different atomic clocks with different sensitivities to α (e.g., Yb⁺ vs. Sr) over a multi-year baseline. A drift in this ratio implies a drift in α.
        expected_signals: [A secular drift in the clock frequency ratio consistent with $\dot{\alpha}/\alpha \lesssim -10^{-18} \text{ yr}^{-1}$.]
        pitfalls: [Uncontrolled systematics in long-term clock stability; environmental effects (thermal, magnetic) causing drifts.]

        outline: |
          Analyze isotopic abundances (e.g., ¹⁴⁹Sm) from the Oklo fossil reactor in Gabon. The neutron capture cross-section of ¹⁴⁹Sm is highly sensitive to α, constraining its value ~2 billion years ago.
        expected_signals: [Isotopic ratios consistent with a value of α that was slightly larger in the past than it is today.]
        pitfalls: [Uncertainties in the geological and neutron-flux models of the reactor.]

        Many BSM theories, particularly those involving light scalar fields like dilatons or quintessence, predict a cosmological evolution of α. The Γ-tail drift maps conceptually to this class of phenomena, with the condensate $\langle\Gamma^2\rangle$ playing a role analogous to a rolling scalar field, though its dynamics are prescribed by the Pirouette framework rather than an ad-hoc potential.

    This effect must be distinguished from the standard QED 'running' of α with energy scale (μ), which is a well-established effect within the Standard Model. Γ-tail drift refers to a variation with cosmological *time*, not interaction energy.

# Γ-tail drift of α

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A small, negative time-variation of the fine-structure constant α, arising as a residual effect (a "tail") from the slow cosmological decay of the mean-squared temporal pressure condensate $\langle\Gamma^2\rangle$. This effect is a low-energy leakage from the dynamics governed by the coherence mass scale, $M_{\text{coh}}$, and provides a direct, albeit faint, observational window into the Γ-field's cosmic evolution. It is predicted to be negative, meaning α was slightly larger in the past.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory language, the Γ-tail drift of α is analogous to the cosmological evolution of a fundamental coupling driven by a slowly decaying scalar field condensate. Unlike ad-hoc models, the sign and magnitude of this drift are not free parameters but are constrained by the underlying dynamics of the temporal pressure field (Γ) and the coherence barrier scale ($\omega_c$). Current observational constraints from quasar spectra and atomic clocks provide some of the most stringent tests of the Pirouette framework's low-energy leakage.
