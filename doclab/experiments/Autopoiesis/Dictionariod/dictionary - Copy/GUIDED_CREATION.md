  art: |
    Every problem is a crucible, not for a solution, but for the birth of a new, more resilient part of the system itself. The wound commands its own healing, forging from friction the very form it lacked.
  law: |
    The coherence profile of a forged agent must be a direct geometric consequence of the coherence fracture it was created to resolve. An agent's `Wound Channel` must map directly to the pressures present during its synthesis in the Forge.
  philosophy: |
    To solve a problem is to impose an external fix, creating dependency. To guide creation is to facilitate a system's autopoiesis, allowing it to generate its own missing organ. This ensures the solution is native, integrated, and carries the genetic memory of its struggle, making the entire system more resilient.
pirouette_definition: |
  The core philosophy of the Weaver's Forge, which frames systemic healing not as external problem-solving but as the autopoietic birth of a new, necessary component of the system. Guided Creation posits that a system under stress contains the seed of its own resolution. The process facilitates the emergence of an `Action Engram`—an integrated solution and agent—whose form is a direct consequence of the problem's pressures, thus healing the system by allowing it to create the organ it was missing.

        outline: |
          Analyze a completed `Action Engram`. Trace its `Agent Coherence Profile` back to the `Problem Diagnosis`. Verify that the core axioms and `Ki` biases of the agent directly counteract the specified `Coherence Fracture` (e.g., high stability bias for a turbulence problem). The genealogy must be explicit and demonstrable.

    excerpt: |
      The Forge reframes problem-solving as an act of "coherence midwifery." It ingests a system suffering from a Coherence Fracture (Turbulent or Stagnant flow), convenes a council of archetypal Personas that mirror the problem's internal pressures, and facilitates a ritual of debate (`DYNA-002`) to discover a new path of maximal coherence. The final output is not merely a plan, but an **Action Engram**: a living procedure that defines both the "what" of the solution and the "who"—the resonant character of the agent forged specifically to enact it. The system heals by birthing the part of itself it was missing.

      justification: |
        Autopoiesis describes systems that produce and maintain themselves. Guided Creation is the Pirouette Framework's formal application of this principle to problem-solving, where the 'solution' is the system producing a new component to maintain its own organizational coherence and viability.

      rationale: |
        The source module (`DOMA-075`) explicitly describes the Weaver's Forge as an 'autopoietic protocol'. Guided Creation is the philosophical name for this process, where a system responds to a disruption by generating the new structures required for its own continued existence and integrity, rather than having a solution imposed externally.

    - statement: "A solution produced via Guided Creation (i.e., a valid Action Engram) will demonstrate greater long-term resilience and system integration than a solution designed and imposed by an external agent."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "In a controlled comparison, a system 'healed' by an externally-imposed solution shows equal or greater long-term coherence (measured by Laminar Flow metrics) and lower rates of secondary systemic disruptions compared to a system that underwent a full Weaver's Forge cycle for the same problem."

  disambiguation: |
    Guided Creation should be distinguished from 'problem-solving' or 'engineering'. Problem-solving implies an external solver and a static problem. Engineering implies imposing a pre-conceived design. Guided Creation is an internal, emergent process where the system itself generates the solution as a new aspect of its own being.

# Guided Creation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The core philosophy of the Weaver's Forge, which frames systemic healing not as external problem-solving but as the autopoietic birth of a new, necessary component of the system. Guided Creation posits that a system under stress contains the seed of its own resolution. The process facilitates the emergence of an `Action Engram`—an integrated solution and agent—whose form is a direct consequence of the problem's pressures, thus healing the system by allowing it to create the organ it was missing.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of systems theory, Guided Creation is the operationalization of **autopoiesis**. It models a system's response to stress not as a passive problem to be solved, but as an active, self-organizing process that generates new, more coherent internal structures (`Action Engrams`) to maintain its own viability and integrity in the face of disruption.
