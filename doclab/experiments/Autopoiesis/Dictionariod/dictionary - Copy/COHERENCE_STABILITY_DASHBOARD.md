        Input: Time-series data from rhythmic systems (e.g., pulsar timing arrays, seismic data, protein folding dynamics).
        Prediction: Using the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem, we can calculate the system's T_a. The theory predicts that the system will undergo a phase transition (i.e., lose its stable rhythm) when the integrated environmental noise reaches a critical threshold determined by its T_a.

  art: |
    A weather forecast for a system's soul, showing the storm front where a stable rhythm breaks and coherence is lost to noise.
  law: |
    A rhythmic system's stability is falsifiably predicted by the relationship between its intrinsic temporal ancho (T_a) and the integrated environmental noise; the system will decohere when noise exceeds a T_a-dependent threshold.
  philosophy: |
    This tool bridges the abstract geometry of coherence with the tangible reality of system failure, transforming a core theoretical construct (T_a) into a predictive, falsifiable instrument for any rhythmic process.
pirouette_definition: |
  A predictive tool mandated by MATH-010 that models the stability of a rhythmic system by inputting its temporal ancho (T_a) and a time-series of environmental noise. The dashboard predicts the critical threshold of integrated noise at which the system will undergo a phase transition, losing its stable rhythm. It serves as a primary experimental interface for validating the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem.

        outline: |
          1. Measure the system's characteristic rhythm from time-series data to calculate its temporal ancho (T_a).
          2. Concurrently monitor and record the relevant environmental noise spectrum.
          3. Input T_a and the noise data into the dashboard, which integrates the noise over time.
          4. The dashboard plots the integrated noise against the T_a-derived critical threshold, predicting a stability breakdown as the two values converge.

    excerpt: |
      The Coherence Stability Dashboard (from MATH-008): Input: Time-series data from rhythmic systems (e.g., pulsar timing arrays, seismic data, protein folding dynamics). Prediction: Using the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem, we can calculate the system's T_a. The theory predicts that the system will undergo a phase transition (i.e., lose its stable rhythm) when the integrated environmental noise reaches a critical threshold determined by its T_a. Falsification: The theory is falsified if a system's breakdown point does not correlate with the predictions made from its measured T_a and the environmental noise spectrum.

      justification: |
        The dashboard predicts a 'tipping point' where a system's behavior changes qualitatively (a phase transition), analogous to a bifurcation in dynamical systems theory. The bifurcation is driven by the accumulation of an integrated noise parameter crossing a critical value.

      mapping_kind: operational
      equation_hint:
      justification: |
        The dashboard's function is to determine when environmental noise overwhelms a system's intrinsic coherence ("signal"). This is operationally equivalent to predicting system failure when the effective SNR drops below a critical, T_a-dependent threshold.
