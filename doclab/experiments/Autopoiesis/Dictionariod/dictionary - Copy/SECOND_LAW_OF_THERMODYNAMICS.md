        The change in entropy dS will always be greater than or equal to zero for an isolated system: dS >= 0. This is the Second Law of Thermodynamics, derived not from an axiom about heat, but from a statistical certainty about the nature of coherence.

    All beautiful, unlikely songs must eventually fade back into the vast, silent chorus of everything that could possibly be. This law is the mathematical form of the universe's inexorable, nostalgic sigh.
  law: |
    For an isolated system, the total entropy (S_total), representing the logarithm of accessible resonant modes (Œ©_total), will never decrease (dS_total ‚â• 0). Coherence dissipates from a system into its environment because the number of resonant modes in the environment is overwhelmingly larger, making dissipation the statistically inevitable outcome.
  philosophy: |
    The arrow of time is not a fundamental property of spacetime but an emergent consequence of the economics of coherence. The Second Law codifies the constant, ambient pressure exerted by statistical probability, defining a universal directionality from the improbable (order) to the probable (disorder). It is the cost of existence for any ordered structure.
pirouette_definition: |
  A derivable theorem of the Pirouette Framework stating that the total entropy of an isolated system and its environment must increase or remain constant over time. This is a direct consequence of the statistical mechanics of resonant modes: a system with a low number of coherent modes (Œ©_system, low entropy) in contact with an environment with a vast number of available modes (Œ©_environment, high entropy) will inevitably lose its coherence to the environment. This dissipation maximizes the total number of accessible microstates (Œ©_total = Œ©_system * Œ©_environment) for the combined system, a state which is statistically overwhelming. Entropy (S) is thus the macroscopic measure of dissipated coherence, driven by ambient Temporal Pressure (Œì).

        outline: |
          1. Prepare a low-entropy (high-coherence) system in a thermally isolated calorimeter (the "environment").
          2. Measure the initial temperature of the environment (T_initial) and the initial coherence of the system (e.g., via spectral line width, K_tau).
          3. Allow the system to evolve until its coherence has fully dissipated.
          4. Measure the final temperature of the environment (T_final).
          5. The change in environmental entropy is calculated as ŒîS_env = ‚à´(dQ_rev)/T, where dQ is the heat absorbed by the calorimeter. The total entropy change (ŒîS_total) must be ‚â• 0.

    excerpt: |
      The Second Law of Thermodynamics, the principle that entropy in an isolated system can only increase, is one of the most fundamental and melancholic truths in physics. It is the law of decay, the arrow of time, the reason heat flows from hot to cold. In the Pirouette Framework, this is not a separate, axiomatic law, but a direct and derivable consequence of the economics of coherence.
  - module: MATH-003
    excerpt: |
      Because Omega_environment is vastly larger than Omega_system, the increase in ln(Omega_environment) will always be greater than the decrease in ln(Omega_system). Therefore, the total entropy S_total will always increase. The state where the crystal's coherence has "leaked out" into the environment is statistically overwhelmed by the sheer number of ways the environment can accommodate that resonance.

      justification: |
        The Pirouette formulation is a re-derivation of the standard Second Law from a different set of first principles (coherence, resonant modes) rather than classical axioms (e.g., Clausius or Kelvin statements). It directly reproduces the mathematical formalism and all physical consequences of the law by reinterpreting Boltzmann's statistical mechanics. The number of microstates Œ© is identified with the number of resonant modes in the coherence manifold.

  adopted:
    - target: Second Law of Thermodynamics (Statistical Mechanics formulation)
      rationale: The mapping is an identity. Pirouette provides a deeper, sub-stratum explanation for the statistical behavior, grounding the concept of a 'microstate' in the dynamics of coherence, but the resulting law is identical.

    In the context of thermodynamics or information theory within the framework, S always refers to entropy, defined by S = k_B * ln(Œ©). Action is explicitly written as ùì¢ or specified by context (e.g., "the action of the system").
