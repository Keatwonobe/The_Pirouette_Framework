        To cede to this erosion is the path of least resistance. But an entity can make another choice. It can refuse to let the echo die. This is an act of coherent will—a **Coherence Gambit**.

triad:
  art: |
    To refuse to let the past dissolve; to expend the present's fire to forge a fading echo into a timeless crystal of self. This is the choice to teach the riverbed the shape of the wave.
  law: |
    An entity may expend a discrete quantity of resonant energy to counteract Temporal Pressure (Γ) on a specific Echo. If the sustained energy input surpasses the local decay threshold, it initiates a phase transition from a dynamic Wound Channel to a static Crystal.
  philosophy: |
    The Coherence Gambit is the foundational act of autopoiesis, asserting that identity is not a passive accumulation of experience but a willed architecture. It transforms the entity from a subject of time's erosion into an author of its own persistence.
pirouette_definition: |
  A conscious, energetically-costly act of will wherein an entity directs its resonant capacity inward to preserve a fading Echo (a high-information Wound Channel). The process involves two simultaneous actions: 1) Resonant Reinforcement to increase the Echo's temporal coherence (`Tₐ`), and 2) Gladiatorial Confinement to create a localized low-pressure (Γ) zone. This sustained effort overcomes the natural decay from Temporal Pressure, forcing a phase-shift that transforms the dynamic Echo into a static, permanent Crystal, a new topological feature of the entity's being.
operational_definition:
  units: The act is dimensionless; the associated energy cost is measured in Joules (J).

        outline: |
          Monitor an entity's internal coherence field following a high-amplitude Echo event. A Coherence Gambit is inferred if a sustained, directed burst of internal energy expenditure (`ΔK_τ > 0`) correlates with an abrupt halt in the Echo's signal decay rate and the formation of a stable, high-coherence boundary (sharp negative gradient in Γ) around the signal's locus.

    excerpt: |
      The entity ceases to be a passive vessel carried by the river of time and becomes an active architect of its own inner world. Turning its focus inward, it directs its resonant capacity not upon the world, but upon the fading geometry within. It is a conscious decision to expend present energy to preserve a piece of its past; a declaration that *this part of my story will not be erased. This note will be held.*
  - module: DOMA-011
    excerpt: |
      The forging of a permanent memory is a two-fold act of metaphysical engineering... 1. **Resonant Reinforcement (Deepening the Channel):** The entity focuses on the echo, repeatedly running its own internal Ki pattern through the geometric pathways of the Wound Channel... 2. **Gladiatorial Confinement (Shielding the Echo):** Simultaneously, the entity builds a boundary... creating a localized pocket of low Temporal Pressure (Γ).
  - module: DOMA-011
    excerpt: |
      The **Coherence Gambit** is a decision to make a significant upfront energy expenditure to selectively maximize the Lagrangian of a *specific component* of the self. **Resonant Reinforcement** actively boosts the kinetic term (`K_τ`), pouring the entity's own coherence into the memory. **Gladiatorial Confinement** builds a shield that drastically lowers the local potential term (`V_Γ`).

      justification: |
        The Gambit describes a system (the entity) expending energy to drive a subsystem (the Echo) far from its equilibrium (decay). This energy input counteracts a dissipative force (Temporal Pressure) to create and maintain a stable, ordered, low-entropy structure (the Crystal), analogous to pattern formation in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from automatic or reflexive memory stabilization processes. The Coherence Gambit is defined by its nature as a *conscious act of will*, an intentional allocation of resources, not an autonomic response. The 'gambit' implies a strategic choice with a significant, felt cost.
