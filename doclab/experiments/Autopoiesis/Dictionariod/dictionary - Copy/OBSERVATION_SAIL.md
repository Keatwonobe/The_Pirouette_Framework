  law: |
    A spatially asymmetric weak measurement applied to a coherent system induces an asymmetric interference pattern. This asymmetry corresponds to a net momentum transfer, producing a directional force on a coupled mechanical element, whose sign and magnitude are controlled by the measurement geometry and information rate.
  philosophy: |
    Directed work can be extracted from a system by modulating local coherence, without applying a net conservative force. The act of observation, by shaping what can be known, becomes a tool for steering. Maps move things.
pirouette_definition: |
  An actuator that generates a net directional force by asymmetrically modulating local coherence via weak measurement. The device converts the back-action from which-way information gathering into a momentum imbalance in a coherent system (e.g., an electron beam), causing a recoil that propels a physical sail. The effect's magnitude scales with the information rate, and its direction is controlled by the geometry of the observation.

        outline: |
          A coherent electron beam is passed through a triadic aperture. Weak which-way sensors on two of the three paths are activated with variable gain `g`, while the third is unobserved. A nanocantilever placed in the far-field diffraction pattern measures the resulting momentum transfer as a deflection `Œîx`. The gain `g` is swept up and down, and the process is repeated with different pairs of arms observed.

      justification: |
        The force on the sail is a manifestation of the drift term that arises in the Wigner function dynamics for a system under continuous, spatially-varying weak measurement. An asymmetric measurement strength `k(x)` creates a non-zero gradient in the induced diffusion `D(x)`, which generates a net drift velocity `Œº(x)` or force.

  disambiguation: |
    An Observation Sail is not a radiation pressure sail. It is propelled by the back-action of information acquisition, not by direct momentum transfer from a particle beam. Its thrust can be steered by changing the measurement geometry while holding beam power constant.

# Observation Sail

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An actuator that generates a net directional force by asymmetrically modulating local coherence via weak measurement. The device converts the back-action from which-way information gathering into a momentum imbalance in a coherent system (e.g., an electron beam), causing a recoil that propels a physical sail. The effect's magnitude scales with the information rate, and its direction is controlled by the geometry of the observation.

## EFT-First Summary
The Observation Sail is an experimental realization of a measurement-induced drift force, formally described by the Lindblad master equation for a system under continuous, spatially-dependent weak measurement. The applied force `F` is proportional to the spatial gradient of the measurement-induced diffusion `D(x)`, which is in turn set by the asymmetric geometry of the weak which-way detectors. This provides a direct link between information acquisition and mechanical work.
