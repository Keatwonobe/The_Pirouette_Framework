    A tiny, persistent wobble in the dance of matter, hinting that the stage itself breathes. It is the universe's stutter, a fleeting imbalance that betrays a deeper, resonant structure.
  law: |
    The deviation of a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment ((g-2)_\ell) from Standard Model predictions is directly proportional to the square of the lepton's mass (m_\ell^2) via coupling to the 17 MeV pseudoscalar Pressuron (Γ).
  philosophy: |
    The anomaly is not a failure of theory but a primary empirical anchor for temporal pressure. It serves as the keyhole through which the subatomic effects of coherence stress become measurable, validating that time has a dynamic, responsive fabric.
pirouette_definition: |
  The experimentally observed, mass-dependent deviation in the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons (specifically the muon) from Standard Model predictions. Within the Pirouette Framework, this deviation is not an anomaly but the primary phenomenological signature of the pseudoscalar Pressuron (Γ), a ~17 MeV excitation of the temporal-pressure field that couples to fermions with a strength proportional to the lepton mass. This scaling naturally explains why the effect is pronounced for muons but negligible for electrons.

          Store polarized leptons (e.g., muons) in a uniform magnetic storage ring. Measure the precession frequency of the lepton's spin relative to its momentum vector (cyclotron frequency). The difference between these two frequencies is directly proportional to the anomalous magnetic moment (a = (g-2)/2).

    excerpt: |
      The lowest-order gauge-invariant coupling to a fermion ( \psi_\ell ) is derivative in form... where ( g_\Gamma \propto m_\ell ) enforces the quadratic mass scaling that reproduces the lepton ( (g−2) ) anomalies. This interaction is anomaly-free and naturally suppressed for light fermions, explaining why the electron g-2 remains consistent with the Standard Model.

        The Pirouette "Leptonic Anomaly" is the framework's name for the specific, well-documented discrepancy between the experimental value of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment and the Standard Model's theoretical prediction. The Pressuron is posited as the source of this discrepancy.

  disambiguation: |
    This term specifically refers to the anomalous *magnetic moment* of leptons, a discrepancy between a specific experimental measurement and its theoretical prediction. It should not be confused with gauge or chiral anomalies in quantum field theory, which describe the failure of a classical symmetry to be preserved at the quantum level.

# Leptonic Anomaly

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The experimentally observed, mass-dependent deviation in the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons (specifically the muon) from Standard Model predictions. Within the Pirouette Framework, this deviation is not an anomaly but the primary phenomenological signature of the pseudoscalar Pressuron (Γ), a ~17 MeV excitation of the temporal-pressure field that couples to fermions with a strength proportional to the lepton mass. This scaling naturally explains why the effect is pronounced for muons but negligible for electrons.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory (EFT), the Leptonic Anomaly corresponds to the well-established "Muon g-2 Anomaly," a >4σ discrepancy between the measured anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the Standard Model prediction. The Pirouette framework explains this by introducing a new ~17 MeV pseudoscalar boson, the Pressuron (Γ), which contributes to the moment via a loop diagram. This model is constrained by and predicts observable signals for various beam-dump and missing-momentum experiments like FASER 2 and DarkQuest.
