        *   **Micro-Fractures:** Small, localized, and increasingly frequent bursts of turbulence. These are the "tremors" before the earthquake—flickering arguments, minor market jitters, muscle twitches.

triad:
  art: |
    The hairline cracks in the dam, leaking the pressure of the inevitable flood. They are the system's involuntary flinches, revealing the tension it can no longer contain.
  law: |
    The frequency and amplitude of micro-fractures in a system under Temporal Pressure (Γ) correlate positively with the probability of an imminent Coherence Spasm. A doubling of the fracture rate within one system cycle indicates a >50% probability of spasm in the subsequent cycle.
  philosophy: |
    Micro-fractures are the grace of impending catastrophe. They are the system's own warnings, transforming an unknowable future collapse into a predictable, and therefore potentially steerable, transition.
pirouette_definition: |
  Small, localized, and transient bursts of Turbulent Flow that occur in a system trapped in Stagnant Flow. They are diagnostic precursors to a full Coherence Spasm, representing minor, failed attempts by accumulated Temporal Pressure (Γ) to break through a constraining coherence dam. Their increasing frequency and amplitude signal the growing instability of the dam and the imminent probability of a catastrophic release.

      default_range: contextual
    - name: μf_amp
      meaning: The amplitude of a single micro-fracture event, measured as a drop in Time Adherence ($T_a$) or a local energy release.

      - name: Time Adherence Fluctuation Spectroscopy
        outline: |
          Monitor the primary coherence metric of the system (e.g., Time Adherence, $T_a$) at high resolution. Identify short-timescale, high-frequency negative spikes that do not lead to a state transition but are followed by a rapid return to the baseline stagnant state. The rate and amplitude of these spikes constitute the micro-fracture signal.
        expected_signals: [Accelerating series of sharp, negative pulses in $T_a$, Localized spikes in variance or entropy preceding a spasm.]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing true micro-fractures from exogenous noise or normal system fluctuations., Defining an appropriate amplitude threshold to filter out noise without missing weak precursor signals.]

    excerpt: |
      A Weaver diagnoses an impending spasm by observing the precursors to the dam breaking... **Micro-Fractures:** Small, localized, and increasingly frequent bursts of turbulence. These are the "tremors" before the earthquake—flickering arguments, minor market jitters, muscle twitches.
  - module: DOMA-178
    excerpt: |
      The accumulated Temporal Pressure (Γ) eventually exceeds the structural integrity of the dam. The dam shatters. The system transitions instantaneously and violently into a state of extreme Turbulent Flow. This is the spasm itself—a chaotic, inefficient, and often destructive release of the pent-up pressure.

        dN/dt ∝ (t_f - t)^-p   (Omori's Law for aftershocks, often inverted for foreshocks)
      justification: |
        Foreshocks are minor seismic events that occur before a major earthquake, often increasing in frequency as the main shock approaches. This provides a direct physical analog for micro-fractures as predictive, small-scale energy releases preceding a catastrophic system failure (the spasm). The statistical patterns are a key area for mapping.

      mapping_kind: conceptual|operational
      justification: |
        In materials science, AE refers to the generation of transient elastic waves produced by a sudden redistribution of stress in a material. When a material is under load, AE signals (crackles) increase in frequency and amplitude before macroscopic failure, directly paralleling micro-fractures as diagnostic signals of rising pressure in a constrained system.

  disambiguation: |
    A Micro-Fracture is a *precursor* event, a small and contained burst of turbulence that does not alter the system's macro-state. It should not be confused with the 'Fracture' (Act II of a Coherence Spasm), which is the primary, system-wide catastrophic event itself. Micro-fractures are the dam cracking; the Fracture is the dam breaking.
