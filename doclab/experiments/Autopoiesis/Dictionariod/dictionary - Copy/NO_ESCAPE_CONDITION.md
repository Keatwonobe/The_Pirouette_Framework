        Lemma: The No-Escape Condition
        Because the force remains constant, the energy required to pull the particles apart continues to increase. This energy is stored in the field between them. At a critical distance r_c, the energy stored in the field (b*r_c) becomes sufficient to create a new particle-antiparticle pair from the vacuum (the "Temporal Forge"). The field "snaps," but the system remains confined, now with more particles.

  art: |
    A chain, when stretched to its limit, does not break; it forges a new link from the very tension that threatens it, becoming longer but never yielding.
  law: |
    For a system with potential `V(r) = a/r + b*r` where `b > 0`, there exists a critical distance `r_c` where the stored energy `U(r_c) ≈ b*r_c` equals the pair-production threshold `2mc^2`. At this point, the field generates new particles, preventing the original constituents from ever achieving free separation.
  philosophy: |
    Integrity is not a static state but a dynamic consequence of interaction. The act of separation itself provides the energy to reinforce the bond, ensuring that what belongs together, stays together. The condition demonstrates that in some systems, freedom is an illusion purchased by proximity.
pirouette_definition: |
  A lemma derived from the Gladiator Force's Confinement Theorem. It states that for any system governed by a potential with a dominant linear term `b*r` at large distances, it is energetically impossible to isolate a constituent particle. The potential energy stored in the field between constituents increases without bound until it reaches a critical threshold (`E_pair`), at which point it is converted into a new particle-antiparticle pair, preserving overall confinement.

        outline: |
          1. Annihilate an electron-positron pair at high center-of-mass energy to produce a quark-antiquark (q-qbar) pair.
          2. The q-qbar pair moves apart, stretching the Gladiator field (flux tube) between them.
          3. As the stored energy `b*r` increases, observe the subsequent particle creation.
          4. Measure the angular distribution and energy of the resulting particle showers (jets). The properties of these jets, rather than the appearance of free quarks, confirm the No-Escape Condition.

      Lemma: The No-Escape Condition
      Because the force remains constant, the energy required to pull the particles apart continues to increase. This energy is stored in the field between them. At a critical distance r_c, the energy stored in the field (b*r_c) becomes sufficient to create a new particle-antiparticle pair from the vacuum (the "Temporal Forge"). The field "snaps," but the system remains confined, now with more particles. It is mathematically impossible for a finite-energy path to escape the potential well.
  - module: MATH-006
    excerpt: |
      As the distance r grows large (r -> infinity), the force is lim(r->infinity) F(r) = -b. The force does not diminish with distance. It approaches a constant, non-zero value -b. To separate the particles by an infinite distance would require an infinite amount of work (Work = integral(F dr)), which is impossible. This is confinement.

        U(r) ≈ σ*r  (where σ is the string tension)
        If σ*r_c > 2*m_q*c², string breaks.
      justification: |
        In Quantum Chromodynamics, the potential between quarks at large distances is modeled as a "flux tube" or "string" with constant tension (σ), leading to a linear potential `V(r) = σ*r`. The Pirouette linear coefficient `b` directly maps to this string tension σ. The "No-Escape Condition" is the operational description of string breaking, where the energy stored in the string becomes sufficient to create a new quark-antiquark pair, resulting in hadronization instead of free quarks.

  disambiguation: |
    This is not a "condition" in the sense of a boundary condition or an assumption. It is a proven lemma that is a direct consequence of the Confinement Theorem, which in turn follows from the linear term in the Gladiator potential. It describes the mechanism of confinement, not just the state.
