        Resource Crucibles: Create buffers against scarcity. Examples: Universal Basic Income (UBI), arts grants, patronage, or any system that provides a stable resource floor, absorbing ambient economic Γ and freeing coherence for higher-order work.
  editors: [system]
  review_log: []
triad:
  art: |
    A stable floor from which to build; a quiet harbor that absorbs the chaotic tides of scarcity, allowing the work of creation to proceed unburdened by the fight for survival.
  law: |
    A system's maximum sustainable coherence output is limited by its ability to buffer contributors from ambient resource pressure. A Resource Crucible decouples a contributor's generative capacity from survival-driven volatility, enabling higher, more stable output.
  philosophy: |
    To unlock the highest potential of its members, a system must first solve their material foundation. By treating basic resources not as a reward for work but as the necessary precondition for it, a Resource Crucible reframes altruism and innovation from a luxury to a baseline capability.
pirouette_definition: |
  A subtype of Coherence Crucible designed to absorb Turbulent Blowback arising from economic or material scarcity. It functions by creating a stable, low-pressure resource floor (e.g., UBI, grants, patronage), which decouples a contributor's generative capacity (K_τ) from ambient economic Temporal Pressure (Γ_econ), thereby preventing Coherence Erosion due to survival-driven volatility.
operational_definition:
  units: Resource-units per cycle time (e.g., currency/month, joules/day)
  symbol_table:
    - name: Γ_econ
      meaning: Temporal Pressure arising from economic scarcity and volatility.
      dimensions: M·L²·T⁻³ (Power/Energy per time) or contextual currency/time.
      default_range: contextual
    - name: C_R
      meaning: Buffering Capacity of the Resource Crucible.
      dimensions: M·L²·T⁻² (Energy) or contextual currency.
      default_range: > survival threshold
  measurement:
    procedures:
      - name: Crucible Efficacy Test
        outline: |
          1. Select a cohort of high-coherence contributors subject to high ambient Γ_econ.
          2. Measure their baseline coherence output (K_τ) and internal stability (via Caduceus Lens, diagnosing Coherence Erosion).
          3. Implement a Resource Crucible (e.g., unconditional cash transfer) for the test group, maintaining a control group.
          4. Re-measure K_τ and internal stability for both groups over several cycles.
        expected_signals: [Arrested or reversed rate of Coherence Erosion in the test group, Stable or increased K_τ in the test group relative to the control group]
        pitfalls: [Insufficient buffer capacity (C_R) to absorb Γ_econ, Confounding pressures from social or procedural domains, Hawthorne effect]

    excerpt: |
      Resource Crucibles: Create buffers against *scarcity*. Examples: Universal Basic Income (UBI), arts grants, patronage, or any system that provides a stable resource floor, absorbing ambient economic Γ and freeing coherence for higher-order work.
  - module: DOMA-182
    excerpt: |
      A Coherence Crucible is an engineered region of the coherence manifold, a bubble of sanctuary defined by one primary characteristic: low ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). It functions as a buffer, a laminar enclave from which a contributor can safely act... The chaotic, dissonant energy dissipates against the buffer, preventing it from striking the contributor directly.

  candidates:
    - target: Buffer solution
      domain: Chemistry
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        A buffer solution resists changes in pH when an acid or base is added. A Resource Crucible resists changes in a contributor's systemic health (coherence) when economic shocks (scarcity or volatility) are introduced. Both provide stability to a core property against external turbulence.
      confidence: 0.7
  adopted:
    - target: Universal Basic Income (UBI) / Social Safety Net
      domain: Economics/Sociology
      mapping_kind: operational
      rationale: |
        The source module explicitly lists UBI as a prime example. This provides a direct, measurable, and widely-understood real-world implementation of a Resource Crucible, acting as a financial floor to absorb economic pressure.
      confidence: 0.95
constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Implementing a Resource Crucible for a cohort of generative contributors will decrease their rate of burnout (Coherence Erosion) and/or increase their net coherence output (K_τ) compared to a control group."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A statistically significant cohort receiving the Crucible shows no change, or a negative change, in sustainable coherence output and burnout metrics compared to the control group over a defined period, after accounting for confounding variables."

naming_notes:
  collisions: []
  disambiguation: |
    A Resource Crucible specifically buffers against *scarcity* and economic pressure (Γ_econ). This distinguishes it from **Procedural Crucibles**, which buffer against temporal and process-based pressure (e.g., deadlines, chaotic workflows), and **Social Crucibles**, which buffer against interpersonal pressure (e.g., conflict, reputational risk).
