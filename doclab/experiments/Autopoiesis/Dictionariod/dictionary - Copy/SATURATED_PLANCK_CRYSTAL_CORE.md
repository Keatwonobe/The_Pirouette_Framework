        (A) Γ-Saturated “Planck Crystal” Core (stiff phase)
        - Equation of state: near a potential minimum Γ≈Γ?, large V''(Γ?) ⇒ large Λ_P ⇒ small compressibility.
        - Profile ansatz: Γ(r)=Γ? - Δ_Γ e^(-r/ξ) for 0≤r<r? (core radius).
        - Effect: Effective index-of-stiffness raises the local GW phase velocity only at (ω/ω_c)^2 order (no extra modes).

  art: |
    A black hole's singular heart replaced by a crystalline kernel of spacetime, phase-locked and rigid against collapse. It is a yolk of time under ultimate pressure, humming with a barely-perceptible temporal stiffness.
  law: |
    The core's stiffness, parameterized by the potential curvature \(V''(\Gamma)\), induces a frequency-dependent phase shift in gravitational waves, \(\Delta\phi_{\rm GW} \propto (\omega/\omega_c)^2\), and sub-percent outward shifts in photon-ring radii, without introducing new GW polarizations or non-zero static tidal Love numbers at leading order.
  philosophy: |
    Provides a singularity-free black hole interior consistent with the Substrate Charter by positing a new, stable phase of the temporal medium. It demonstrates that extreme gravity need not break physical laws but can instead induce a state transition, preserving information and providing falsifiable, high-precision observational signatures.
pirouette_definition: |
  A proposed phase of the temporal medium forming the interior of a black hole, replacing the classical singularity. It is characterized by a high-stiffness equation of state where the Γ-field is locked near a potential minimum (\(\Gamma \approx \Gamma_\star\), large \(V''(\Gamma_\star)\)). This 'crystal' structure has low compressibility, supports only tensor (TT) GW modes which propagate with a phase velocity corrected at \(O((\omega/\omega_c)^2)\), and matches smoothly to an exterior GR metric at a finite core radius \(r_\ast\).

        outline: |
          Measure the phase evolution of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) from a black hole merger ringdown across multiple modes (\(n, l, m\)). A Γ-Saturated Core predicts a phase deviation from the GR prediction that grows quadratically with mode frequency, \(\Delta\phi \propto (\omega_{nlm}/\omega_c)^2\). Coherently stack signals from multiple events to measure the integral \(\int (\partial_r\Gamma)^2 dr\).
        expected_signals: ["A consistent \(\omega^2\) dephasing across all QNMs.", "A train of low-amplitude, sharply-defined echoes with spacing determined by \(r_\ast\)."]
        pitfalls: ["Low signal-to-noise ratio masking the \((\omega/\omega_c)^2\) suppression.", "Confusion with environmental effects or instrument noise.", "Mismodeling of the exterior (non-Kerr) geometry."]

    excerpt: |
      Model black-hole interiors as **new phases of the temporal medium** consistent with the substrate charter, replacing GR singularities with **finite** Γ-structured states. We provide two minimal phases... ( A ) **Γ-Saturated “Planck Crystal” core** (stiff, phase-locked) and ( B ) **Vortex-Foam decoherent core** (turbulent, coherence-fragmented). Both leave the exterior metric GR-like while imprinting **tiny, falsifiable** signatures in ringdown, photon rings, and late-time GW tails.
  - module: DYNA-BH-INT-001
    excerpt: |
      Phase shift through Γ-core (your lighthouse):
      \[ \Delta\phi_{\rm GW} \simeq \kappa \left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_c}\right)^2 \int_0^{r_\ast}\!dr\, \big(\partial_r \Gamma(r)\big)^2, \]
      ... Partial reflectivity at \(r_\ast\) (stiff core): tiny GW **echo train** with spacing \(\Delta t \approx 2\int_{r_\ast}^{r_{\rm ph}} dr/\sqrt{f(r)g(r)}\), but **no extra polarizations**.

  candidates:
    - target: Exotic Compact Object (ECO) / Regular Black Hole
      domain: GR
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      equation_hint: |
        \(ds^2=-e^{2\Phi(r)}dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1-2G m(r)/r}+r^2 d\Omega^2\), where \(m(r) \to 0\) as \(r\to 0\).
      justification: |
        Like other ECO models (e.g., gravastars), the Planck Crystal Core replaces the central singularity with a regular, finite-density structure. It is a specific realization of this concept within the Pirouette framework, with a definite equation of state derived from the Γ-field.

      justification: |
        The frequency-dependent phase shift \(\Delta\phi_{\rm GW} \propto \omega^2\) is mathematically equivalent to GWs propagating through a medium with a non-trivial refractive index. This provides a direct link between the core's microphysics (\(V''(\Gamma)\)) and a macroscopically observable wave propagation effect.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the 'Vortex-Foam Decoherent Core', the alternative turbulent interior phase which predicts phase noise rather than a coherent phase shift. 'Planck Crystal' refers to the high order and stiffness at the Planck energy scale (\(\sim \omega_c\)) where GR's singularity would form; it does not imply a lattice of discrete particles.
