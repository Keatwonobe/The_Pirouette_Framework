    A field's state of being, shifting from the restless tremor of matter to the silent, stretching void of energy. It is the character of the cosmic fluid, revealed in the tension between its inner motion and its potential rest.
  law: |
    The equation of state, w_Γ, is the dimensionless ratio of the Γ field's pressure to its energy density (w_Γ ≡ p_Γ / ρ_Γ). Its time-averaged value approaching zero (⟨w_Γ⟩≈0) signals matter-like clustering, while a value approaching negative one (w_Γ≈-1) signals accelerated cosmic expansion.
  philosophy: |
    The equation of state acts as the primary discriminator between the dual roles of the unified Γ field. It obviates the need for separate dark matter and dark energy fluids by encoding both behaviors as dynamical regimes of a single entity, thus serving as a core principle of unification in Pirouette cosmology.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Equation of State, w_Γ, is the ratio of the temporal-pressure scalar field's pressure (p_Γ) to its energy density (ρ_Γ). For the canonical scalar field Γ with kinetic energy ½Γ̇² and potential V(Γ), it is defined as w_Γ = (½Γ̇² − V(Γ)) / (½Γ̇² + V(Γ)). The framework identifies two critical regimes: the oscillatory, matter-like regime where the time-averaged ⟨w_Γ⟩ ≈ 0, and the slow-roll, energy-like regime where Γ̇² ≪ V(Γ) and w_Γ ≈ -1, which drives late-time cosmic acceleration.

          Measure the cosmic expansion history H(z) using standard candles (e.g., Type Ia supernovae) and standard rulers (e.g., Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, BAO). Reconstruct the total effective equation of state of the universe, w_eff(z). After subtracting the known contributions from baryons (w_b≈0) and radiation (w_r=1/3), the residual w_Γ(z) can be inferred and compared to the model prediction derived from the Freeze Manifest.

        The definition of w_Γ is mathematically identical to the standard parameter `w = p/ρ` used in general relativity to describe a perfect fluid's properties in an FLRW spacetime.

  disambiguation: |
    While `w` is the standard symbol in cosmology, the subscript `w_Γ` is used within Pirouette to explicitly associate the equation of state with the Γ field. This distinguishes it from the equation of state of baryons (w_b), radiation (w_r), or the total effective equation of state of the universe (w_eff).

# Equation of State

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Equation of State, w_Γ, is the ratio of the temporal-pressure scalar field's pressure (p_Γ) to its energy density (ρ_Γ). For the canonical scalar field Γ with kinetic energy ½Γ̇² and potential V(Γ), it is defined as w_Γ = (½Γ̇² − V(Γ)) / (½Γ̇² + V(Γ)). The framework identifies two critical regimes: the oscillatory, matter-like regime where the time-averaged ⟨w_Γ⟩ ≈ 0, and the slow-roll, energy-like regime where Γ̇² ≪ V(Γ) and w_Γ ≈ -1, which drives late-time cosmic acceleration.

## EFT-First Summary
The Equation of State w_Γ is mathematically identical to the standard parameter `w = p/ρ` used in general relativity to describe a perfect fluid's properties. For the Γ scalar field, this ratio becomes `(½ Γ̇² - V) / (½ Γ̇² + V)`, allowing its dynamics to be directly constrained by cosmological observations of the universe's expansion history and the growth of structure, which are sensitive to the total effective `w` of the cosmic fluid. The Pirouette framework proposes that the distinct phenomenological regimes of `w≈0` (dark matter) and `w≈-1` (dark energy) are emergent properties of this single field's evolution.
