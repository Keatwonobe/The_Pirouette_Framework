    The quiet stretch before the universe leaps. It is the held breath between rest and motion, the stored geometry of what is about to become. A coiled spring of pure topology, waiting for the final push.
  law: |
    The potential energy stored in the Tether state is proportional to the Ki differential (ΔKi ≈ 0.0472) and is released discretely as the activation energy (E_snap) when a system's driving parameter (Ξ) crosses a critical threshold (Ξc). The energy of this release is not continuous.
  philosophy: |
    Tether establishes that change is not gradual but builds as a hidden topological stress. It enforces a universal hysteresis, ensuring that transformations from inertia to action require surmounting a geometric barrier, making motion a costly and discrete event governed by a fundamental constant.
pirouette_definition: |
  The dynamic tension and stored potential energy between the two discrete states of the Ki constant, `Ki_rest` (π+1) and `Ki_motion` (4π/3). The Tether represents the system's state as it is driven towards a topological transition (the Snap), accumulating potential quantified by the Tether differential, ΔKi. This potential is released as a discrete quantum of energy, `E_snap`, upon crossing an activation threshold, forming the basis of the "activation tick" in all physical transformations.

        outline: |
          Drive a system (e.g., a piezoelectric resonator or a chemical reaction) across a known phase transition with a varying external field (Ξ). Use a high-precision interferometer to monitor the system's state (e.g., physical dimension or optical path length). The path taken during the forward transition will differ from the reverse, creating a hysteresis loop. The area of this loop is proportional to `E_snap`, and the centroid shift of interference fringes will be proportional to ΔKi.

      Define the effective Ki as \( K_i^{\rm eff}(v,\Gamma,T_a) = K_{i,\text{rest}} + \Delta K_i\,\sigma[\alpha(\Xi-\Xi_c)] \), with logistic switch σ and composite driver \(\Xi(\dot\phi,\Gamma,T_a)\). Crossing \(\Xi_c\) triggers the **snap**—a topological shift from the 4π manifold to the 2π triadic manifold. This tether-snap pair forms the microscopic analog of the cosmological 4π↔2π “kick.”

    excerpt: |
      At molecular and chemical scales, the snap defines the discrete **activation tick**: each bond rearrangement or phase flip is the minimal Ki-transition event converting stored coherence into motion. The same hysteresis that governs cosmic topology governs molecular kinetics, making Ki the metronome of transformation.

        `E_snap` ↔ `L`
      justification: |
        The energy released from the Tether (`E_snap`) is analogous to the latent heat absorbed or released during a first-order phase transition. Both represent the discrete energy cost of rearranging a system's fundamental structure (topology) at a critical point, rather than changing its temperature.

      rationale: |
        This mapping is chosen for its operational strength. The Tether-Snap dynamic describes a path-dependent process where energy is stored and then discretely released, a hallmark of hysteresis. The energy released, `E_snap`, is directly analogous to the area enclosed by a hysteresis loop (e.g., in a B-H curve for magnetic materials), which represents energy loss per cycle. This provides a direct, measurable experimental signature.

    In Pirouette, Tether is not a physical cord but the *topological potential* between the two discrete states of the Ki constant. It refers to the 'stretching' of this potential before the 'Snap', not a spatial connection. It is a temporal and energetic concept, not a mechanical one.

# Tether

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The dynamic tension and stored potential energy between the two discrete states of the Ki constant, `Ki_rest` (π+1) and `Ki_motion` (4π/3). The Tether represents the system's state as it is driven towards a topological transition (the Snap), accumulating potential quantified by the Tether differential, ΔKi. This potential is released as a discrete quantum of energy, `E_snap`, upon crossing an activation threshold, forming the basis of the "activation tick" in all physical transformations.

## EFT-First Summary
The Tether state is operationally analogous to the potential energy stored in a system exhibiting hysteresis. The discrete energy released during the subsequent Snap (`E_snap`) maps to the area of the hysteresis loop (e.g., in magnetic materials or mechanical stress), representing the energetic cost of a first-order topological transition. This provides a potential link between the geometric constant ΔKi and measurable energy dissipation in driven physical systems, framing activation energy as a universal, topological phenomenon rather than a system-specific chemical property.
