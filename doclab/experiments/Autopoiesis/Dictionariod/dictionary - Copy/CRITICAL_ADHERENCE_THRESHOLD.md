    The razor's edge where shared focus either crystallizes into collective action or shatters into noise. It is the silent moment before the wave breaks, the held breath before the song begins.
  law: |
    The Critical Adherence Threshold (T_c) is the specific, measurable value of time adherence (T_a) at which the coherence order parameter (ψ) exhibits non-analytic behavior, scaling as |ψ| ∝ (T_c - T_a)^β_P for T_a < T_c, with β_P ≈ 1/2. Below this threshold, coherence is zero or exponentially suppressed; above it, coherence is non-zero and stable.
  philosophy: |
    T_c establishes that complex systems—from quantum fields to human consciousness and societies—do not decay gracefully but collapse at predictable, sharp boundaries. It posits that the structure of reality is not continuous but is punctuated by critical junctures where quantitative changes in 'adherence' to a shared rhythm produce qualitative shifts in existence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Critical Adherence Threshold, T_c, is the critical value of the time adherence control parameter (T_a) in the Landau–Pirouette Functional. It marks the boundary of a second-order phase transition in the coherence order parameter (ψ). For T_a > T_c, the system is in a disordered, incoherent state (ψ = 0), while for T_a < T_c, it spontaneously develops non-zero coherence (ψ ≠ 0). Near this point, coherence |ψ|, correlation length ξ_P, and susceptibility χ_P exhibit universal scaling behavior governed by the Pirouette critical exponents.

        outline: |
          1. Identify a system with a tunable control parameter analogous to time adherence (T_a), such as cognitive load (Γ) or social curl (Θ).
          2. Measure the corresponding order parameter (ψ), e.g., TPCI ridge height or social synchronization.
          3. Systematically vary T_a across the expected transition region and measure the equilibrium value of ψ.
          4. T_c is identified as the value that allows data from different system sizes or measurement scales to collapse onto a single universal curve when plotted against the scaled variable |T_a - T_c|.

      The coherence correlation length and susceptibility also diverge near the critical point:

      These scaling laws unify the Pirouette framework under a consistent renormalization flow.

        The Landau–Pirouette Functional is a direct generalization of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy for second-order phase transitions. T_c in the Pirouette framework plays the identical mathematical role as the critical temperature T_c in systems like ferromagnets or superfluids: it marks the point where the coefficient of the quadratic term in the order parameter expansion changes sign, triggering spontaneous symmetry breaking.

    The Critical Adherence Threshold (T_c) should not be confused with a simple operational setpoint. T_c marks a point of non-analyticity in the system's governing functional, characterized by divergent susceptibility and correlation length, distinguishing it from a smooth or arbitrary decision boundary.

# Critical Adherence Threshold

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Critical Adherence Threshold, T_c, is the critical value of the time adherence control parameter (T_a) in the Landau–Pirouette Functional. It marks the boundary of a second-order phase transition in the coherence order parameter (ψ). For T_a > T_c, the system is in a disordered, incoherent state (ψ = 0), while for T_a < T_c, it spontaneously develops non-zero coherence (ψ ≠ 0). Near this point, coherence |ψ|, correlation length ξ_P, and susceptibility χ_P exhibit universal scaling behavior governed by the Pirouette critical exponents.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of statistical field theory, the Critical Adherence Threshold (T_c) is directly analogous to the critical temperature in a Ginzburg-Landau theory of second-order phase transitions. It is the control parameter value where the effective mass-squared term for the coherence field (ψ) passes through zero, driving a condensation that results in spontaneous symmetry breaking and the emergence of a non-zero vacuum expectation value for ψ. See: Chaikin & Lubensky, *Principles of Condensed Matter Physics*.
