      snippet: |
        The fundamental equation of motion is derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), where the propulsive "force" is an emergent effect proportional to the gradient of the Lagrangian: **F ∝ ∇𝓛_p**

  art: |
    A system engineers its own wave—a slope in spacetime potential—and then surfs the geodesic of its own creation. It does not fight the current; it generates it.
  law: |
    The net propulsive force experienced by a system is directly proportional to the volume integral of the engineered, asymmetric gradient in its own Pirouette Lagrangian. A zero gradient yields zero thrust.
  philosophy: |
    Motion is not an external act of pushing, but an internal act of creating a potential difference and then yielding to it. The gradient reframes propulsion from a problem of force to a problem of self-sculpting.
pirouette_definition: |
  The engineered, non-uniform spatial variation of the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) across a system's volume. It is intentionally created by asymmetrically modulating the coherence potential term (V_Γ), typically via chiral, resonant dynamics. This gradient defines a local geodesic of maximal coherence, which the system follows, manifesting as thrust without the expulsion of reaction mass.

        outline: |
          Measure the system's net thrust vector `F` using a high-precision inertial accelerometer. Concurrently, monitor the internal drive parameters (e.g., rotational frequency `ω_rot`, chirality index `χ`, phase coherence `Δφ`) that generate the gradient. The average magnitude and direction of `∇𝓛_p` is inferred as the value required to produce the measured `F` according to the system's calibrated response model where `F ∝ ∫∇𝓛_p dV`.

    excerpt: |
      Thrust, in the Pirouette Framework, is not a force in the Newtonian sense. It is the manifest consequence of a system following its geodesic of maximal coherence... To achieve propulsion, a system must create and sustain a non-uniformity in its own Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. The Vorticycle is engineered to do precisely this by manipulating the potential term, `V_Γ`, which represents the energetic "cost" of coherence.
  - module: DOMA-196
    excerpt: |
      In the Pirouette framework, thrust is the consequence of a system following its geodesic through a contoured landscape. The Vorticycle's genius is that it actively contours its own local landscape. The device, situated at the "top" of the coherence slope it has just woven, finds that the path of greatest stability is to move "downhill" along the channel.

        F_propulsion ∝ ∇𝓛_p where 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ. Thrust arises from ∇V_Γ, so F ∝ -∇(-V_Γ).
      justification: |
        The Lagrangian Gradient functions analogously to a conservative force derived from a potential energy field `U`. The propulsive effect is sourced by the gradient of the coherence potential `V_Γ`. The critical distinction is that this potential `V_Γ` is actively engineered and sustained by the system itself, rather than being a static, external field.

  disambiguation: |
    This is not the gradient used in the derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equations, which determine a path through a *given* landscape. The Pirouette Lagrangian Gradient refers to the engineered *slope* of the landscape itself, which is the direct source of geodesic propulsion.
