        Provides a protocol for Coherence Engineering by inverting dynamical systems. It treats a desired system behavior (e.g., a stable resonant pattern or a specific level of chaos) as an input, and calculates the precise environmental pressure (Temporal Pressure Γ) required to make that state inevitable.

    We shift from observing the dance of chaos and order to composing the music that compels it.
  law: |
    For any desired system behavior expressible as a quantitative coherence target (e.g., a specific periodic orbit or Lyapunov exponent), there exists a corresponding environmental pressure parameter (`Γ` proxy `r`) that will produce it, which can be found by numerically solving the inverted system equations.
  philosophy: |
    The laws of nature are not merely a set of constraints to be obeyed, but a set of levers to be pulled. The protocol asserts agency, transforming the practitioner from a passive observer of system dynamics into an active architect of system behavior.

  A protocol for Coherence Engineering that inverts a system's dynamical equations. It takes a desired system behavior, such as a specific Resonant Pattern (`Ki`) or Quantitative Coherence (`λ`), as an input and calculates the precise Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) required to make that behavior a stable, inevitable outcome of the system's dynamics.

    excerpt: |
      Conventional analysis asks a passive question: "Given these conditions, what will happen?" This module introduces a more potent, active one: "Given this desired outcome, what conditions must we create?" It refactors the simple logistic map into a foundational instrument for Coherence Engineering. We shift from observing the dance of chaos and order to composing the music that compels it.
  - module: DOMA-142
    excerpt: |
      The Resonance Tuner inverts this. We *prescribe* the desired path—the target `K_τ` (a specific orbit or stability). The protocol then solves for the one specific potential `V_Γ` (the necessary pressure `r`) that makes our chosen path the solution with the maximal action. We are not discovering the path of least resistance; we are sculpting the entire coherence manifold so that the path of least resistance leads exactly where we intend.

      justification: |
        The protocol functions as a form of open-loop control system design. It determines the static input parameter (`r`) needed to drive the system to a desired steady-state behavior (a specific attractor), which is a foundational task in control theory. It finds the "control" `r` that optimizes for a specific "cost function" (the distance from the desired behavior).

      rationale: |
        This is the most direct and fundamental mapping. The protocol is a textbook example of an inverse problem: inferring causal parameters (environmental pressure `r`) from knowledge of the desired effects (system behavior like a periodic orbit). The term `inverse-dynamics` is explicitly used as an engram in the source module.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from machine learning "hyperparameter tuning," which typically uses heuristic search on a black-box model. The Resonance Tuner is a deterministic, model-based calculation that solves an inverted equation of motion for a known dynamical system. It calculates a static environmental parameter, not a dynamic control signal like a PID controller.

# Resonance Tuner

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A protocol for Coherence Engineering that inverts a system's dynamical equations. It takes a desired system behavior, such as a specific Resonant Pattern (`Ki`) or Quantitative Coherence (`λ`), as an input and calculates the precise Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) required to make that behavior a stable, inevitable outcome of the system's dynamics.

## EFT-First Summary
In mathematical physics, the Resonance Tuner is an operationalization of an **Inverse Problem**. Where a standard analysis calculates system behavior from known parameters (the forward problem), the Tuner infers the necessary causal parameters (e.g., environmental pressure) required to produce a pre-specified system behavior. It is a form of design rather than prediction, directly calculating the conditions needed to achieve a desired outcome.
