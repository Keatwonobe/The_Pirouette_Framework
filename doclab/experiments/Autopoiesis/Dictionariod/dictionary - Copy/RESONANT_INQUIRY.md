        To navigate this junction, the system executes a Resonant Inquiry: it deliberately loosens its own internal coherence (Ki) to "sample" the available paths, listening for the echo of greatest harmony.

triad:
  art: |
    A system holds its breath, dissolving the certainty of who it is for a moment to listen to the echoes of who it might become.
  law: |
    A system at a coherence fork will enter a transient superposition of states to sample available geodesics, deterministically collapsing into the path that maximizes the projected integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`S_p = ‚à´ ùìõ_p dt`).
  philosophy: |
    The mechanism is the engine of evolution, the basis of strategy, and the physics of will, grounding the abstract concept of choice in a physical process of coherence optimization.
pirouette_definition: |
  The four-stage process by which a system, poised at a Coherence Fork, momentarily and deliberately loosens its internal coherence (Ki) to enter a superposition of states. It projects low-energy observer shadows along available geodesics to sample the resonant feedback of potential futures, then collapses its state and commits to the path that maximizes the projected Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`).

        outline: |
          1. Isolate a system approaching a known bifurcation point using Flow Diagnostics (DYNA-001).
          2. Monitor its internal coherence pattern (Ki) with high temporal resolution.
          3. At the fork, observe a brief, controlled dip in mean Ki ("Resonant Loosening"), accompanied by the emergence of low-amplitude, multi-modal oscillations corresponding to the sampled paths.
          4. Detect the collapse event as the multi-modal signature resolves into a single, high-coherence frequency on the new trajectory.
        expected_signals: [Coherence dip-and-recover profile (T‚Çê-Dip), transient multi-modal resonance, post-collapse spike in Information Genesis rate.]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing the controlled dip of an Inquiry from a chaotic Coherence Spasm; signal-to-noise ratio obscuring the low-energy sampling oscillations.]

    excerpt: |
      A Fork is not a random split or a chaotic breakdown, but a sophisticated and orderly act of creation. It is a geometric feature of the coherence manifold itself‚Äîa point of poise where a system's path splits into multiple viable futures. To navigate this junction, the system executes a Resonant Inquiry: it deliberately loosens its own internal coherence (Ki) to "sample" the available paths, listening for the echo of greatest harmony.
  - module: DOMA-061
    excerpt: |
      The system "casts its echo" down each potential geodesic, using its Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) to pre-sample the shape of future Wound Channels. It is asking: "In which future can my song be sung most clearly?" The path that promises the most stable, efficient, and powerful future coherence returns the strongest, most harmonious echo. This feedback allows the system to collapse its superposition, "snapping" into a new, sharp Ki pattern aligned with the chosen path.

      justification: |
        Resonant Inquiry is analogous to integrating over a discrete set of possible histories (paths). The "resonant feedback" acts like the phase factor `exp(iS)`, with the chosen path being the one where constructive interference is maximized, corresponding to an extremum of the action (in this case, the Pirouette Lagrangian). The "loosening" phase creates the conditions for multiple paths to be explored, akin to quantum fluctuations.

      justification: |
        The four stages (Loosening, Sampling, Collapse, Commitment) map directly onto models of decision-making: exploration of options, evaluation of outcomes, choice, and execution. Resonant Inquiry provides a physical substrate for what is often treated as a purely abstract cognitive process.

    - statement: "The duration of a Resonant Inquiry (Œît_inq) is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the coherence gradient between the two most viable future paths."

      falsifier: "Observation of systems where choice duration is constant regardless of the difference in outcome quality, or where systems make instantaneous choices at a Fork with no detectable coherence dip."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The term 'Resonance' is ubiquitous in physics (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance, orbital resonance). Pirouette's usage is specific to the feedback loop of a system's coherence pattern with its environment.]
  disambiguation: |
    Resonant Inquiry is a controlled, strategic process undertaken from a state of poised stability and low external pressure (Œì). It must not be confused with a *Coherence Spasm*, which is an uncontrolled, chaotic response to overwhelming external pressure, resulting in a turbulent state transition rather than a clean choice.
