    The gravitational pull of universality. As we zoom out, the beta-function describes the path a system's essence takes, shedding incidental details until it settles into one of a few fundamental forms, like a river finding its final, inexorable course to the sea.
  law: |
    The beta-function β(g) is the logarithmic rate of change of a coupling constant g with respect to a length-scale transformation ℓ: β(g) ≡ dg/dlnℓ. Its zeros, where β(g*)=0, define the scale-invariant fixed points that govern the universal behavior of the system at phase transitions.
  philosophy: |
    The beta-function is the engine of emergence. It formally shows how complex, microscopic details become irrelevant at macroscopic scales, replaced by a simpler, universal description. This mathematical structure is Pirouette's core argument for why disparate systems—minds, markets, matter—can share the same fundamental patterns of coherence and collapse.
pirouette_definition: |
  The beta-function, denoted β_i, is the differential equation governing the evolution of a coupling constant `g_i` in the Landau-Pirouette Functional (LPF) under a renormalization group (RG) transformation. Defined as `β_i ≡ dg_i/dlnℓ`, where ℓ is the length-scale factor, it constitutes a vector field on the space of all possible couplings. The flow generated by this field dictates how the effective description of a system changes with scale. The zeros of the beta-function correspond to scale-invariant fixed points, which define the universality classes of coherence transitions. The stability matrix at these fixed points, `M_ij = ∂β_i/∂g_j`, determines the critical exponents of the transition.

          4. Plot β_i vs. g_i to identify fixed points (where the curve crosses zero) and determine their stability (the slope at the crossing).

        The Pirouette β-function is a direct application of the Wilsonian Renormalization Group concept, defining the flow of couplings in an effective field theory (the LPF) under coarse-graining of length scales (ℓ). This is mathematically equivalent to the Callan-Symanzik equation's description of coupling evolution with respect to momentum scale (μ) in quantum field theory. Both formalisms identify universal behavior at scale-invariant fixed points.

  disambiguation: |
    The RG β-function is a function that returns the rate of change of a coupling constant; it is not a specific numerical value or a special mathematical function like the Euler beta function. It is unrelated to the thermodynamic beta (inverse temperature), although both can appear in the same statistical mechanics context. In Pirouette, β always refers to the RG flow equation unless explicitly subscripted (e.g., β_T for thermodynamic).

# Beta-function

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The beta-function, denoted β_i, is the differential equation governing the evolution of a coupling constant `g_i` in the Landau-Pirouette Functional (LPF) under a renormalization group (RG) transformation. Defined as `β_i ≡ dg_i/dlnℓ`, where ℓ is the length-scale factor, it constitutes a vector field on the space of all possible couplings. The flow generated by this field dictates how the effective description of a system changes with scale. The zeros of the beta-function correspond to scale-invariant fixed points, which define the universality classes of coherence transitions. The stability matrix at these fixed points, `M_ij = ∂β_i/∂g_j`, determines the critical exponents of the transition.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette β-function is the standard Callan-Symanzik β-function applied to the Landau-Pirouette Functional (LPF), an effective field theory for coherence. It describes how the LPF's coupling constants (e.g., `a`, `b`, `λ`) run with changes in length scale `ℓ` or, equivalently, momentum scale `μ`. As in QFT, the zeros of the β-function identify scale-invariant fixed points (conformal field theories) that control the universal behavior of the system, such as the critical exponents at a second-order phase transition.
