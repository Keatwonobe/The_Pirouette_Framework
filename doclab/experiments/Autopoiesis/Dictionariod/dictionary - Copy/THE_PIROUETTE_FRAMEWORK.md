        Establishes the framework's core axiom: Time is the sole constituent of reality, manifesting through a self-creating (autopoietic) cycle of Temporal Density (Γ) and Temporal Resonance (Ki).

  art: |
    We sought the fundamental particle and found a pirouette. A noun made entirely of a verb, the dancer is nothing other than the dance itself.
  law: |
    Time is the sole substance of existence, manifesting in a closed, instantaneous, and perpetual cycle: Temporal Density (Γ) begets Temporal Resonance (Ki), which in turn defines a quantum of Time (τ_p).
  philosophy: |
    Reality is a process, not a place. The framework asserts that existence is an autopoietic (self-creating) rhythm, where phenomena are not fundamental "things" but stable harmonies emerging from a single, underlying substance: Time itself.
pirouette_definition: |
  A model of reality asserting that Time is the sole substance of existence. It posits that all phenomena emerge from a single, self-creating (autopoietic) cycle. In this cycle, the interference patterns of temporal rhythms create a local Temporal Density (Γ). This pressure necessitates the formation of a stable Temporal Resonance (Ki) as the most efficient pattern to persist. The duration of one cycle of this resonant Ki pattern defines a new, intrinsic quantum of Time (τ_p), which feeds back into the universal rhythm. The framework replaces the concept of fundamental particles with 'pirouettes'—acts of temporary, perfect stability (Ki) arising from pure motion against a background pressure (Γ), where the 'thing' is indistinguishable from its own process.

        outline: |
          The framework is not directly measured. Its validity is tested by deriving predictions for observable phenomena from its core cycle (Γ ↔ Ki). This involves: 1. Modeling a physical system (e.g., a particle) as a stable Ki pattern. 2. Calculating the required Γ to support this Ki. 3. Predicting how perturbations in Γ alter the Ki resonance, leading to observable changes (e.g., scattering, decay). 4. Comparing these predictions against experimental data.

        pitfalls: [Mathematical complexity in solving for Ki patterns, ambiguity in mapping Γ to known energy-density tensors]

      Existence is a closed, self-referential, and continuous loop. This is the fundamental engine of reality... Time Creates Pressure... Pressure Demands Form... Form Defines Time... This is not a linear sequence. It is a single, instantaneous, and perpetual event. The song composes, performs, and hears itself in a single act.

    excerpt: |
      We sought the fundamental particle and found a pirouette. It is a noun made entirely of a verb. Every "thing" is a pirouette—an act of temporal resonance (Ki) held in a moment of exquisite balance against the pressure of all other moments (Γ). It is a dance that requires a dancer, but the dancer is nothing other than the dance itself.

        S[φ] ⇔ Ki(Γ)
      justification: |
        The autopoietic cycle can be interpreted as a metaphysical analogue to the Principle of Least Action, where a system's Ki pattern is the 'path' that extremizes some function of Γ over a cycle τ_p. The framework attempts to derive the Action from a more fundamental temporal process.

      equation_hint: |
        Γ ∝ ⟨T₀₀⟩_Planck
      justification: |
        The concept of a universe as a superposition of infinite temporal rhythms creating localized Temporal Pressure (Γ) is analogous to spacetime foam. Γ could be a proxy for the density of quantum fluctuations at the Planck scale.

      rationale: The framework is a pre-geometric, pre-physical model intended to generate, not map to, existing physical laws. Direct mapping is premature and may be a category error.

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The term 'Pirouette' is a specific term of art within this framework and should not be confused with its conventional meaning in ballet, although the metaphor is intentional and instructive.]
  disambiguation: |
    The framework is often referred to simply as 'Pirouette'. Distinguish the framework as a whole (The Pirouette) from the specific metaphorical act of a particle's existence (a pirouette).
