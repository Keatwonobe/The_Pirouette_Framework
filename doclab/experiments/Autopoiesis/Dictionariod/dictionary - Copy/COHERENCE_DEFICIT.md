    The shadow cast by an incomplete map. It is the universe's most generous gift: a precise and quantifiable map of everything we do not yet understand, pointing not to what is known, but to what is knowable.
  law: |
    The Coherence Deficit (ΔK_τ) is the time-series difference between a system's observed temporal coherence (K_τ_obs) and its predicted coherence (K_τ_pred) from a hypothesized Lagrangian. A persistent non-zero deficit indicates the presence of unmodeled dynamics.
  philosophy: |
    The deficit is not a model failure but the primary diagnostic signal for revealing unmodeled dynamics ('semantic dark matter'). It drives an autopoietic process where gaps in understanding become the engine for refining a system's model.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence Deficit (ΔK_τ) is the time-series that quantifies the divergence between a system's observed evolution and the trajectory predicted by a hypothesized Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛̂_model`). It is formally defined as the difference between the system's measured temporal coherence (`K_τ_obs`) and the predicted coherence (`K_τ_pred`) that would manifest if the system perfectly followed the geodesic of `𝓛̂_model`. A non-zero deficit is interpreted not as a model failure but as the primary signal revealing the structure of the unmodeled `Shadow Lagrangian` (`𝓛_shadow`). A persistent negative deficit (`Coherence Leak`) signifies unmodeled pressure, while a persistent positive deficit (`Coherence Spring`) indicates unmodeled coherence.

          3. Measure the system's real-world behavior to determine its observed coherence, `K_τ_obs(t)`.
          4. Compute the Coherence Deficit, `ΔK_τ(t) = K_τ_obs(t) − K_τ_pred(t)`.
          5. Analyze the deficit's structure to hypothesize a `Shadow Lagrangian`, `𝓛_shadow`.
          6. Update the model (`𝓛̂_model ← 𝓛̂_model + 𝓛̂_shadow`) and repeat the process.

    excerpt: |
      This deficit is not noise, nor is it failure. It is the most valuable signal a Weaver can receive: the shadow cast by unmodeled forces. It provides the engine for an autopoietic process of discovery, where every gap in our understanding becomes a compass pointing directly toward a more complete map.
  - module: DOMA-038
    excerpt: |
      A non-zero Coherence Deficit is the "gravitational lensing" of systems analysis. It allows us to detect the presence of invisible masses that bend a system's trajectory. These unmodeled influences, collectively termed **semantic dark matter**, are formally represented by the **Shadow Lagrangian (`𝓛_shadow`)**—the portion of the system's true Lagrangian that is missing from our model.

      domain: Statistics

      justification: |
        Mathematically, the Deficit is a time-series of residuals between observed and predicted values. The Pirouette framework elevates residuals from noise to be minimized into a primary signal containing structured information about unmodeled dynamics.

      domain: Control Theory
      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        The Deficit functions identically to an error signal in a feedback control system. It measures the deviation of the system's output (observed coherence) from the desired setpoint (predicted coherence), and this signal is used to update the controller (the model `𝓛̂_model`).

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The Shadow Lagrangian (`𝓛_shadow`) revealed by the Deficit is analogous to a perturbation term added to an unperturbed Lagrangian (`𝓛_0`). The deficit's structure informs the analyst about the nature of the missing term needed to correct the initial model.
      confidence: 0.7
  adopted:
    - target: Residual ε = y − ŷ
      rationale: This is the most direct mathematical and statistical analogue, providing a clear bridge for practitioners from other fields. The key Pirouette distinction is philosophical and operational: treating the residual as the primary signal.

    - statement: "A persistent, non-zero ΔK_τ always corresponds to a structural, unmodeled dynamic (𝓛_shadow) rather than irreducible stochastic noise."

      falsifier: "A system exhibits a persistent ΔK_τ that cannot be reduced by iteratively adding physically plausible terms to 𝓛̂_model, suggesting the deficit is either irreducible noise or a fundamental breakdown of the Lagrangian model."

    Unlike statistical 'residuals' which are often treated as noise to be minimized, the Coherence Deficit is axiomatically treated as a primary diagnostic signal containing structured information. It is not an 'error' in the model, but a measure of the model's *incompleteness*.

# Coherence Deficit

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Coherence Deficit (ΔK_τ) is the time-series that quantifies the divergence between a system's observed evolution and the trajectory predicted by a hypothesized Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛̂_model`). It is formally defined as the difference between the system's measured temporal coherence (`K_τ_obs`) and the predicted coherence (`K_τ_pred`) that would manifest if the system perfectly followed the geodesic of `𝓛̂_model`. A non-zero deficit is interpreted not as a model failure but as the primary signal revealing the structure of the unmodeled `Shadow Lagrangian` (`𝓛_shadow`). A persistent negative deficit (`Coherence Leak`) signifies unmodeled pressure, while a persistent positive deficit (`Coherence Spring`) indicates unmodeled coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Deficit is mathematically equivalent to the time-series of residuals (`ε = y - ŷ`) in statistical modeling. However, its philosophical and operational role differs: where residuals are often treated as stochastic noise to be minimized, the Deficit is axiomatically treated as a structured signal. Analysis of the Deficit's shape, magnitude, and correlations is the primary method for identifying missing terms (`𝓛_shadow`) in the system's effective Lagrangian, analogous to using anomalies to infer undiscovered particles or forces.
