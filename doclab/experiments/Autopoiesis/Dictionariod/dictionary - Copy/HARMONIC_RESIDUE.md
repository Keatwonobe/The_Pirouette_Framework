  law: |
    The harmonic residue **h** is the component of the residual social flow **r** that is both curl-free (∇×**h**=0) and divergence-free (∇·**h**=0). It represents structural tension that cannot be dissipated through local cooperative adjustments (the gradient field) or antagonistic circulation (the curl field).
  philosophy: |
    Harmonic residue signifies that not all social friction is dynamic or resolvable through intervention. It represents the structural 'given' of a system—the deep-seated ideological, historical, or geographical divides that define the boundary conditions for any possible social coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  In the Hodge decomposition of the residual flow **r** (the difference between observed social flow **J**_obs and coherence-optimal flow **J**_opt), the harmonic residue **h** is the unique vector field component that is both irrotational (curl-free) and incompressible (divergence-free). It quantifies persistent, non-dynamic structural tension, such as deep-seated polarization, which is mathematically orthogonal to both resolvable cooperative deficits (the gradient field, ∇φ) and antagonistic circulations (the curl field, ∇×**A**).

# Harmonic Residue

## Canonical (Pirouette)
In the Hodge decomposition of the residual flow **r** (the difference between observed social flow **J**_obs and coherence-optimal flow **J**_opt), the harmonic residue **h** is the unique vector field component that is both irrotational (curl-free) and incompressible (divergence-free). It quantifies persistent, non-dynamic structural tension, such as deep-seated polarization, which is mathematically orthogonal to both resolvable cooperative deficits (the gradient field, ∇φ) and antagonistic circulations (the curl field, ∇×**A**).

## EFT-First Summary
The Harmonic Residue **h** is mathematically equivalent to the generators of the first homology group of the social interaction graph. It represents the fundamental, non-bounding cycles in the network—loops of interaction that are not the result of some other localized process. These "topological defects" in the social fabric manifest as enduring polarization or structural divides that cannot be resolved through dynamic flows, acting as fixed boundary conditions for all social activity.
