        summary: "Provides a modernized, time-first protocol for analyzing arbitrary information
        streams by passing them through a rhythmic 'sieve.' This process separates coherent,
        signal-like patterns (Kτ) from dissonant, noise-like components (Γ),
        producing a rich 'Coherence Profile.' A derived Coherence Ratio (CR) offers a
        powerful signal-to-noise diagnostic for assessing the health and character of
        any information flow."

    A stethoscope for the river of information. It is an act of listening so intently to the roar of reality that you can finally hear the song hidden inside it, distinguishing the steady current of signal from the turbulent eddy of noise.
  law: |
    An information stream's dynamic state is diagnosed by its Coherence Profile, a time-series of (Kτ, Γ) pairs, derived by segmenting the stream into temporal windows. The derived Coherence Ratio, CR = Kτ / Γ, quantifies the stream's signal-to-noise efficiency in each window.
  philosophy: |
    To understand a dynamic system, one must analyze not just its state, but the quality of its flow. By separating coherent patterns from dissonant noise, the Sieve provides a direct, measurable diagnostic for the health, efficiency, and underlying structure of any information current.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Rhythmic Sieve is a three-stage, time-first analysis protocol that partitions an information stream into discrete temporal windows (Rhythmic Segmentation), calculates the Coherence (Kτ) and Dissonance (Γ) within each window (Coherence Profiling), and uses these metrics and their ratio (CR) to diagnose the stream's state of flow—Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (for the primary output, Coherence Ratio).

    - name: Kτ
      meaning: Coherence; a measure of a segment's internal order, predictability, and resonant structure.

    - name: Γ
      meaning: Dissonance; a measure of a segment's internal chaos, unpredictability, and noise.

        outline: |
          1.  **Segmentation:** Partition the input information stream into a series of temporal windows (fixed or adaptive size).
          2.  **Profiling:** For each window, calculate Coherence `Kτ` (e.g., via autocorrelation strength, dominant Fourier mode amplitude) and Dissonance `Γ` (e.g., via Shannon entropy).
          3.  **Diagnosis:** Compute the Coherence Ratio `CR = Kτ / Γ`. Analyze the time-series of `(Kτ, Γ, CR)` to identify flow states based on their distinct signatures.
        expected_signals: [Laminar (high, stable CR), Turbulent (low, volatile CR), Stagnant (sustained, near-zero CR)]
        pitfalls: [Mismatched window size can obscure phenomena at the wrong timescale; choice of proxy calculation for Kτ or Γ may not be suitable for all stream types.]

    excerpt: |
      By profiling a stream in terms of the interplay between Coherence and Dissonance, we can diagnose its state of flow (`Laminar`, `Turbulent`, or `Stagnant`) with far greater precision... Laminar Channels: Regions characterized by high, stable `Kτ` and low `Γ`... Turbulent Eddies: Regions marked by high `Γ` and low `Kτ`... Stagnant Pools: Regions where both `Kτ` and `Γ` are persistently low.
  - module: DOMA-181
    excerpt: |
      The Rhythmic Sieve is an empirical instrument for observing the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) in action... The measured Coherence (`Kτ`) of a segment is a direct observation of the "kinetic" term... The measured Dissonance (`Γ`) is a direct observation of the "potential" or pressure term. By plotting the Coherence Profile, a Weaver creates an empirical map of the system's path through its own coherence manifold.

    - target: Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)

      equation_hint: |
        CR = Kτ / Γ  ~  SNR = P_signal / P_noise
      justification: |
        The Coherence Ratio (CR) is explicitly defined as the ratio of a coherent signal component (Kτ) to a dissonant noise component (Γ). This is a direct operational and conceptual analog to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio used ubiquitously in engineering and information theory.

      confidence: 0.9
    - target: Shannon Entropy H(X)
      domain: Information Theory
      mapping_kind: mathematical
      justification: |
        The Dissonance (Γ) term is explicitly proxied by Shannon Entropy in the source module. It quantifies the uncertainty or disorder within a temporal window, aligning directly with the definition of entropy.
      references: []
      confidence: 0.8
  adopted:
    - target: Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
      rationale: The primary output of the Sieve, the Coherence Ratio (CR), is a direct and intentional parallel to SNR, making this the most potent and operationally useful mapping for interpreting results.
      confidence: 0.9

  claims:
    - statement: "For any information stream, regions with a high and stable Coherence Ratio (CR > 1) will exhibit higher data fidelity and lower predictive error than regions with a low or volatile CR."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Demonstration of a system with a consistently low CR (< 0.5) that simultaneously exhibits high-fidelity, error-free, and predictable information transmission."

  disambiguation: |
    The Rhythmic Sieve is a *temporal* process for analyzing dynamic information streams, not a static filter for selecting numbers based on properties. It separates signal from noise based on their rhythmic character over time, not their intrinsic value.
