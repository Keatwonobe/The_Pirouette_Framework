  art: |
    The crucible transforms heat and pressure into a tempered blade. This metric is the alchemical report card of that process, measuring how much strength is forged from each unit of fire endured. It is the quantification of antifragility.
  law: |
    A system's Recovery Efficiency is positive when a given integrated load (VΓ) produces a net gain in functional reserve (Kτ). A protocol is considered effective if, for a constant class of load, repeated applications yield a stable or increasing ΔKτ / ΔVΓ. A negative or diminishing ratio indicates over-stress or maladaptation.
  philosophy: |
    This metric forces an escape from the naive belief that "more is better." It shifts the focus from the magnitude of the stimulus (Γ) to the quality of the response (ΔKτ), defining success not by the load carried, but by the capacity built from carrying it. It is the core feedback signal for navigating the razor's edge between productive stress and destructive strain.
pirouette_definition: |
  Recovery Efficiency is a conceptual performance indicator representing the rate of change in a system's Coherence (Kτ) per unit of integrated Temporal Pressure (VΓ) applied over a defined period. As the central measure of a protocol's effectiveness, it quantifies the functional gain achieved for a given investment of stress, guiding adjustments toward optimal adaptation.

        outline: |
          1. **Establish Baseline (T₀):** Measure a stable proxy for Kτ, such as 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), peak VO₂, or max reps for a given lift.
          2. **Apply Protocol (T₀ → T₁):** Execute a defined protocol for a fixed duration (e.g., 4 weeks). Quantify the total applied load (VΓ) using proxies like (average RPE × total duration) or (total work in kJ).
          3. **Measure Post-Intervention (T₁):** Re-measure the same Kτ proxy under identical conditions.
          4. **Calculate:** Compute ΔKτ = (Kτ₁ - Kτ₀) and ΔVΓ = (VΓ₁ - VΓ₀). The ratio is ΔKτ / ΔVΓ.
        expected_signals: [Positive ratio indicates adaptation, Negative ratio indicates maladaptation or injury, Plateauing ratio suggests a need for protocol change]

        Recovery Efficiency is conceptually analogous to thermodynamic efficiency. It represents a ratio of useful "work" output (functional gain, ΔKτ) to the total energetic/stressful "heat" input (applied load, ΔVΓ). Both are dimensionless measures of a system's conversion performance.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from simple "progress" or "gains." Recovery Efficiency is not the absolute gain (ΔKτ) but the gain *relative to the cost* (ΔVΓ). A protocol can produce large gains at an unsustainable cost, yielding low efficiency, while a highly efficient protocol produces the most gain for the least stress.

# Recovery Efficiency

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Recovery Efficiency is a conceptual performance indicator representing the rate of change in a system's Coherence (Kτ) per unit of integrated Temporal Pressure (VΓ) applied over a defined period. As the central measure of a protocol's effectiveness, it quantifies the functional gain achieved for a given investment of stress, guiding adjustments toward optimal adaptation.

## EFT-First Summary
Recovery Efficiency (ΔKτ / ΔVΓ) is an operational metric analogous to the **training adaptation slope** in exercise physiology (d(Fitness)/d(Load)) and conceptually similar to **thermodynamic efficiency** (η). It measures the system's output of functional capacity (ΔKτ) relative to the input of integrated stress (ΔVΓ). This ratio serves as the key feedback parameter for optimizing protocols, ensuring that applied loads are constructively building capacity rather than merely being endured.
