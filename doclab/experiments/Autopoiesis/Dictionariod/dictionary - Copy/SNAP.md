        Crossing Ξ_c triggers the **snap**—a topological shift from the 4π manifold to the 2π triadic manifold. This tether-snap pair forms the microscopic analog of the cosmological 4π↔2π “kick.”

  art: |
    The universe holds its breath, storing tension in a geometric tether, until with a sudden release, a new coherence is born. It is the click of a lock, the spark of a reaction, the rhythm of becoming.
  law: |
    The transition between `K_i,rest` and `K_i,motion` manifolds occurs when a composite driver Ξ(ϕ̇, Γ, Ta) exceeds a critical threshold Ξ_c, releasing a quantized energy packet E_snap and causing a discrete change in system topology.
  philosophy: |
    The Snap is the universe's reconciliation between rest and motion. It is the fundamental, discrete act of transformation, proving that all change, from chemical bonds to cosmic leaps, is a rhythmic release of stored geometric potential.

  A rapid, discrete, and irreversible topological transition between the 4π (`K_i,rest`) and 2π (`K_i,motion`) coherence manifolds. The Snap is triggered when a composite driver Ξ crosses a critical threshold Ξ_c, releasing the energy stored in the Ki-tether (ΔKi). This event constitutes the fundamental activation tick for physical processes, converting stored phase coherence into kinetic energy or structural change.

    excerpt: |
      At molecular and chemical scales, the snap defines the discrete **activation tick**: each bond rearrangement or phase flip is the minimal Ki-transition event converting stored coherence into motion. The same hysteresis that governs cosmic topology governs molecular kinetics, making Ki the metronome of transformation.

# Snap

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A rapid, discrete, and irreversible topological transition between the 4π (`K_i,rest`) and 2π (`K_i,motion`) coherence manifolds. The Snap is triggered when a composite driver Ξ crosses a critical threshold Ξ_c, releasing the energy stored in the Ki-tether (ΔKi). This event constitutes the fundamental activation tick for physical processes, converting stored phase coherence into kinetic energy or structural change.

## EFT-First Summary
While no direct mapping to an EFT term is yet adopted, the Snap is conceptually analogous to a first-order phase transition in statistical mechanics. It describes a rapid, hysteretic change in the system's topological state, triggered at a critical threshold, which releases a quantum of latent energy (`E_snap`). This provides a potential mechanism for quantized activation energies in physical processes.
