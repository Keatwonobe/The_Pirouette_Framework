        0 < Coherence Index < 1 (Turbulent Coherence): The system is in a state of struggle, beset by internal friction and external pressure. Energy is being wasted, and its pattern is noisy and inefficient. This is the signature of stress and chaos.

  art: |
    A dissonant song from a choir pulling in different directions; a river fighting its own eddies. It is the sound of a system struggling against itself, losing energy to internal friction.
  law: |
    A system exhibits Turbulent Coherence if and only if its Coherence Index, measured as the squared magnitude of the mean phase vector of its components, is strictly greater than zero and less than one (0 < |C|² < 1). This state is characterized by inefficient energy transfer and a non-zero rate of geodesic deviation.
  philosophy: |
    This is the state of becoming, struggle, and adaptation. It is not merely noise, but the contested space between order and chaos where systems are tested, evolve, or fail. To understand this state is to understand the dynamics of life, conflict, and change.
pirouette_definition: |
  A state of systemic operation characterized by the partial, unstable, and inefficient alignment of its constituent components. It is quantitatively identified by a Coherence Index between 0 and 1, signifying a noisy and dissonant Ki pattern. This state is a direct signature of a system expending energy to overcome internal friction or external Temporal Pressure (Γ), causing it to deviate from its geodesic of maximal coherence.

        outline: |
          1.  **Isolate Rhythm:** Identify the core cyclical pattern (Ki) for N components of the system. Extract the phase (θ_j) for each component at a given time slice.
          2.  **Calculate Coherence:** Compute the Coherence Vector, C = (1/N) Σ exp(iθ_j).
          3.  **Diagnose State:** Calculate the Coherence Index, |C|². If the result is > 0 and < 1, the system is in a state of Turbulent Coherence.
        expected_signals: [Semi-periodic signals with high phase noise, partially correlated component states]
        pitfalls: [Misidentifying the primary Ki of the system, insufficient sampling of components (low N), mistaking measurement noise for true systemic incoherence]

    excerpt: |
      **0 < Coherence Index < 1 (Turbulent Coherence):** The system is in a state of struggle, beset by internal friction and external pressure. Energy is being wasted, and its pattern is noisy and inefficient. This is the signature of stress and chaos. Examples: a turbulent fluid, a society in civil conflict, a mind consumed by anxiety.
  - module: DOMA-191
    excerpt: |
      **Low Coherence:** Characterizes a system with a chaotic, noisy, or decaying Ki pattern. Its rhythm is dissonant and unpredictable. This is a stressed or dying system, wasting energy in temporal friction and struggling to maintain its form against the pressure of the Temporal Forge (Γ). It is a burst of static.

        Re > Re_crit
      justification: |
        This state is the direct analogue of turbulent flow in fluid dynamics, which occurs above a critical Reynolds number (Re_crit). Both are characterized by chaotic, unpredictable behavior, high energy dissipation, and a breakdown of simple, ordered motion (laminar flow). The Coherence Index serves a role analogous to an inverse Reynolds number, where high values signal order and low values signal turbulence.

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        A spin glass is a magnetic state characterized by frustration, where competing interactions prevent components (spins) from aligning neatly. This mirrors the concept of "internal friction" and "struggle" in Turbulent Coherence, where components cannot achieve a unified, low-energy configuration.

  disambiguation: |
    Turbulent Coherence (0 < |C|² < 1) must be distinguished from **Laminar Coherence** (|C|² ≈ 1), a state of high order and efficiency, and **Coherence Collapse** (|C|² ≈ 0), a state of total disorder and systemic dissolution. Turbulent Coherence is the dynamic, friction-filled regime between these two extremes.
