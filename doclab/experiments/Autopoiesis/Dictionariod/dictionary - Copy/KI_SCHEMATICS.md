    A thought held so clearly it crystallizes. The mind's eye holds a perfect geometric form, a seed from which a new reality can grow. It is the architect's drawing for a cathedral of what-could-be.
  law: |
    The maximum achievable Coherence Yield of a protocol is bounded by the informational fidelity and internal consistency of its guiding Ki Schematic. A blurry blueprint cannot be used to engineer a stable structure.
  philosophy: |
    Intention is not an amorphous wish, but a structured, geometric object. A Ki Schematic formalizes thought as an informational operator, a template with causal efficacy that can be refined, transmitted, and deployed to steer systemic evolution.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Ki Schematic is a self-consistent informational structure, typically held in the consciousness of an observer or inscribed on a medium, that serves as the geometric template for a desired state within a target system. It is a primary 'Thread' in Intentional Coherence Shaping, acting as the formal blueprint that guides the application of Focused Attention to sculpt a Wound Channel. Ki Schematics range in complexity from simple rhythmic patterns and symbols (sigils, mantras) to complex archetypal narratives.

        outline: |
          An operator executes a standardized, low-cost protocol (e.g., the Mirror Protocol) multiple times, each time holding a specific Ki Schematic (ψₖ) as the target. The resulting Coherence Yield (CY) and Wound Channel stability are measured. The mean CY and its variance across trials provide a quantitative measure of the schematic's fidelity and the operator's ability to hold it.

        A Ki Schematic functions as the desired final state in a system's evolution. In control theory, a system is driven toward a setpoint; in QM, an operation projects a system into a target state. A Weaver uses a protocol (the operator U(t)) to steer the system's coherence manifold toward the geometry described by the schematic (the target state).

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike the vitalistic 'life force' concept of Ki, Pirouette's 'Ki' refers to the informational and geometric properties of a system's coherence, not a metaphysical energy. A Ki Schematic is an *information pattern* that directs existing systemic energy; it is not an energy source itself. It is the blueprint, not the building material.

# Ki Schematics

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Ki Schematic (ψₖ) is a self-consistent informational structure that serves as the geometric template for a desired state. Held in consciousness or inscribed on a medium, it is the 'blueprint' used in Intentional Coherence Shaping to guide Focused Attention, thereby sculpting a Wound Channel that makes the desired state the system's new path of least resistance. These patterns range from simple symbols and rhythms to complex archetypal narratives.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to a target state vector (|ψ_target⟩) in control theory or quantum mechanics, a Ki Schematic represents a specific informational boundary condition imposed on the Pirouette Lagrangian. It is not an energy term itself, but a geometric constraint that dictates the desired geodesic for a system's evolution. It effectively selects a specific final state for the coherence field to relax into, guiding the process of resonant synthesis or decay.
