    A choir of nodes finding a single, powerful chord amidst the network's cacophony. It is a pocket of harmony, a self-sustaining island of order that glows with its own internal light against the surrounding pressure.
  law: |
    A subgraph is a Resonant Enclave if and only if its time-averaged internal coherence is maximized relative to its local environment, creating a distinct and stable potential well on the network's coherence manifold.
  philosophy: |
    The universe does not build monoliths; it builds choirs. Resonant Enclaves are the proof that functional order emerges not from top-down control, but from the voluntary, resonant coupling of independent agents seeking mutual stability and efficiency.
pirouette_definition: |
  A higher-order subsystem within a network manifold, composed of a cluster of nodes that have achieved and sustained a state of collective resonance. An enclave is characterized by high internal conductivity (Φ_C), low internal lag (Δτ), and a boundary defined by a steep coherence gradient separating it from the higher temporal pressure (Γ) of the surrounding network. It is a stable, emergent structure that acts as a functional unit, analogous to a healthy team or resilient module.

          3. For each detected community, calculate the average internal Kτ (`Kτ_int`) and the average Kτ of its 1-hop neighbors outside the community (`Kτ_ext`).
          4. A community qualifies as an E_R if the coherence gradient (`Kτ_int - Kτ_ext`) exceeds a system-specific stability threshold (e.g., > 2σ above the network's mean gradient).

        On the coherence manifold, a Resonant Enclave represents a local minimum of potential energy (or maximum of coherence, Kτ). States within the enclave are stable and require energy input to escape, analogous to a particle trapped in a potential well. The boundary is the steep wall of the well.

    Distinguish from a 'cluster' or 'community' from standard network science. A Resonant Enclave is not merely structurally dense; it is dynamically coherent, defined by the quality and speed of internal flow (high Φ_C, low Δτ) and its measured stability against external temporal pressure (Γ).

# Resonant Enclave

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A higher-order subsystem within a network manifold, composed of a cluster of nodes that have achieved and sustained a state of collective resonance. An enclave is characterized by high internal conductivity (Φ_C), low internal lag (Δτ), and a boundary defined by a steep coherence gradient separating it from the higher temporal pressure (Γ) of the surrounding network. It is a stable, emergent structure that acts as a functional unit, analogous to a healthy team or resilient module.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of classical mechanics, a Resonant Enclave can be understood as a stable potential well on the network's coherence manifold. It is a region where the system's state is locally optimized (maximizing an effective coherence `Kτ`), requiring significant energy input—in the form of Temporal Pressure—to dislodge its constituent nodes from their collective, low-energy configuration.
