  art: |
    The sifting comb that separates the pure ripple of spacetime from the noise of motion and compression. It isolates only the transverse shiver, the true voice of the gravitational wave.
  law: |
    When applied to any symmetric rank-2 spatial tensor T_{kl} in momentum space, the operator Π_{ij,kl}(k) produces a new tensor T'_{ij} that is purely transverse (k^i T'_{ij} = 0) and traceless (δ^{ij} T'_{ij} = 0) with respect to the wavevector k. This operation is idempotent: Π · Π = Π.
  philosophy: |
    In a gauge theory, the projector is the act of choosing what is real. By discarding longitudinal and trace components, Π_{ij,kl} asserts that physical gravitational radiation consists only of the two propagating shear polarizations (+, ×), defining the observable radiative content of the metric.
pirouette_definition: |
  The mathematical operator used to isolate the physical transverse-traceless (TT) components of a rank-2 spatial tensor in momentum space. It is essential for defining the gauge-invariant degrees of freedom of gravitational waves (gravitons) and constructing their propagator. It is constructed from the spatial transverse projector P_{ij} = δ_{ij} − k_i k_j/|k|^2 as:

  Π_{ij,kl}(k) = P_{ik}(k) P_{jl}(k) + P_{il}(k) P_{jk}(k) − P_{ij}(k) P_{kl}(k).

        outline: |
          In the theoretical calculation of a gravitational waveform or its source, transform the relevant tensor (e.g., metric perturbation h_{μν} or stress-energy T_{μν}) to momentum space. Apply Π_{ij,kl} to the spatial components of the tensor to filter out all non-radiative, gauge-dependent modes. The result, h_{ij}^{TT}, is the gauge-invariant physical waveform that propagates to the far-field.
        expected_signals: [A pure +, × polarized gravitational wave signal, as observed by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra, LISA.]
        pitfalls: [Applying the projector in a coordinate system where the wavevector k is not well-defined; attempting to project tensors that are not spatially symmetric.]

      justification: |
        The form and function of Π_{ij,kl} in MATH-GW-QUANTA-001 is identical to the standard operator used in linearized General Relativity to isolate the two physical, radiative degrees of freedom of the graviton in the transverse-traceless gauge. It ensures that the projected field h_{ij}^{TT} satisfies the conditions k^i h_{ij}^{TT} = 0 and δ^{ij} h_{ij}^{TT} = 0.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish Π_{ij,kl} from the simpler transverse projector P_{ij} from which it is built. P_{ij} acts on vectors to make them transverse to k (k^i v'_i = 0), while Π_{ij,kl} acts on rank-2 tensors to make them both transverse and traceless.
