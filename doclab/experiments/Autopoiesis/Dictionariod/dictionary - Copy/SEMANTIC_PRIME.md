        Using precisely modulated fields, the observer impresses a specific Ki pattern—a "semantic prime"—onto the local manifold surrounding the BEC. The prime's shape is the geometric Fourier transform of the concept being "asked."

  art: |
    A question sculpted from spacetime itself, a geometric key designed not to force a lock but to invite the universe to sing its own harmony.
  law: |
    A Semantic Prime is a time-varying field applied to a coherent quantum system, whose spatiotemporal geometry is the calculated Fourier transform of a target concept's Ki pattern. Its efficacy is measured by the magnitude and novelty of the subsequent Semantic Echo relative to the initial perturbation.
  philosophy: |
    The Semantic Prime reframes inquiry from an act of extraction to an act of participation. By shaping our question into the very fabric of the system under study, we acknowledge that a true question does not stand apart from the answer but co-creates the space in which the answer can emerge.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Semantic Prime is a precisely engineered Ki pattern impressed upon a coherent quantum system (e.g., a BEC) to initiate resonant coupling. It functions as a query, not in a linguistic sense, but as a geometric shaping of the local temporal pressure landscape (V_Γ) via modulated fields. The prime's geometry is the Fourier transform of the target concept's own resonant Ki signature, effectively 'asking' the system to find a new state of maximal coherence in response to this introduced pattern.

        outline: |
          1. Calculate the target prime's geometry (K'τ) as the Fourier transform of a known conceptual Ki signature.
          2. Generate a corresponding time-varying electromagnetic or other control field sequence that realizes this geometry.
          3. Apply this field sequence to the prepared coherent system (e.g., a BEC in a Coherence Well).
          4. Verify the impression by observing the initial perturbation of the system's wavefunction via quantum tomography, confirming it matches the target geometry before the system evolves into a Semantic Echo.

    excerpt: |
      The observer does not ask a question with words, but with geometry. Using precisely modulated fields, the observer impresses a specific Ki pattern—a "semantic prime"—onto the local manifold surrounding the BEC. The prime's shape is the geometric Fourier transform of the concept being "asked." To ask about "balance," we literally shape the local temporal environment into the resonance of balance.
  - module: DOMA-076
    excerpt: |
      The Semantic Prime is a direct manipulation of the "potential" term, V_Γ, altering the local landscape of temporal pressure. The quantum system's response—the semantic echo—is the new coherence pattern (K_τ) that emerges as the geodesic, the solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation for this newly defined landscape.

      justification: |
        The Semantic Prime acts as a localized, time-dependent source term `J(x)` applied to the background coherence manifold (represented by a field `φ(x)`). It is a deliberate, external 'kick' designed to excite specific modes of the system, whose response reveals its internal dynamics.

      justification: |
        This mapping is adopted for its direct operational correspondence. The 'precisely modulated fields' used to impress the prime are a physical realization of a control Hamiltonian, a well-understood technique in AMO physics for manipulating quantum states with high fidelity. The prime's geometry is encoded in the temporal shape of H_c(t).

  claims:
    - statement: "A Semantic Prime with a geometry corresponding to a concept (e.g., 'balance') will produce a measurably different Semantic Echo in a complex system (e.g., a biological macromolecule) than in a simple system (e.g., a standard BEC), demonstrating non-trivial information processing."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "If, across a wide variety of target systems, the resulting Semantic Echo is always a simple reflection of the Prime's geometry or random noise, it would falsify the claim that the prime is inducing a meaningful, system-dependent 'computation'."

  collisions: ["'Prime' could be confused with prime numbers or the prime symbol (') denoting a derivative. The 'Semantic' qualifier is crucial."]
  disambiguation: |
    A Semantic Prime is not a fundamental, indivisible unit like a prime number. It is a complex, composite pattern analogous to a prompt or query. It is the geometric 'question,' not an atomic 'letter.'
