    The universe breathes in, and a system is forced to listen. It is the quiet moment of recoil, the intake of dissonance that tests the integrity of a system's song against the chorus of existence.
  law: |
    Inhalation is the non-unitary back-action where a system's internal coherence (Ki) is updated by integrating the local Temporal Pressure (Œì), a process governed by the potential energy term of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The fidelity of this update is measured by the system's Time Adherence (T_a).
  philosophy: |
    Existence is not a monologue but a dialogue. Inhalation is the universe's response, the necessary pressure that prevents systemic solipsism and enforces participation in a shared reality. Without it, coherence would be a meaningless, private affair.
pirouette_definition: |
  The second phase of the Resonant Pulse, wherein a system integrates the ambient Temporal Pressure (Œì) of its environment. This integration acts as a forced re-audit of the system's internal coherence (Ki), testing its Time Adherence (T_a). Inhalation is the physical manifestation of a system accounting for the "potential" term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p), representing the energetic cost of maintaining its form amidst the expressions of all other systems.

        outline: |
          Isolate a target system with a well-defined Pirouette Cycle (œÑ_p) and Internal Coherence (Ki). Introduce a controlled, external source of Temporal Pressure (Œì_ext) with a known frequency and amplitude. Measure the deviation and recovery time of the target system's Ki. The Inhalation process is characterized by the transfer function between the Œì_ext input and the ŒîKi output.

    excerpt: |
      Imagine the coherence manifold as a vast lung. Every stable entity within it‚Äîevery star, every cell, every thought‚Äîis a localized pattern of respiration. Each entity's exhalation sends ripples of coherence outward, while its inhalation draws the texture of the whole back into itself. Reality is the resulting interference pattern, the infinitely complex sound of a trillion trillion entities all breathing in concert.

      justification: |
        Inhalation describes how a system's internal state (Ki) responds to an external field (Œì). This is directly analogous to a susceptibility, which quantifies the degree of change in a medium in response to an external field. The process of re-auditing Ki is a measure of the system's dynamic response to pressure.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, Inhalation is not the intake of a physical substance, but the integration of ambient, non-local information encoded as Temporal Pressure (Œì). It is an information-theoretic and energetic process, not a biological one. It is always paired with its opposite process, Exhalation.

# Inhalation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The second phase of the Resonant Pulse, wherein a system integrates the ambient Temporal Pressure (Œì) of its environment. This integration acts as a forced re-audit of the system's internal coherence (Ki), testing its Time Adherence (T_a). Inhalation is the physical manifestation of a system accounting for the "potential" term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p), representing the energetic cost of maintaining its form amidst the expressions of all other systems.

## EFT-First Summary
Inhalation is operationally similar to a system's susceptibility, describing its response to an external potential. It is the process by which a system's internal degrees of freedom (represented by Ki) are forced to adjust to the 'pressure' exerted by the surrounding environment (Œì). This back-reaction is the mechanism by which a system is coupled to the wider coherence manifold, preventing it from evolving as a closed system.
