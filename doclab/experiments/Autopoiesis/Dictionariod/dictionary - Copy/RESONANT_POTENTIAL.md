        3. **Scale Invariance in (Γ)** (→) Conservation of Resonant Potential ((Φ_Γ))

  art: |
    A still point in a turning world, where the scale of pressure finds its timeless form. It is the echo that remains when the sound has faded, the structural pattern that holds across all sizes of storm.
  law: |
    For any isolated system described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, the total Resonant Potential Φ_Γ is conserved under transformations that scale the temporal pressure field Γ. Its rate of change is zero: dΦ_Γ/dt = 0.
  philosophy: |
    Resonant Potential embodies the principle that deep structures are independent of their intensity. That a system possesses a conserved essence, irrespective of the pressure it is under, provides a unifying constant across the physical, cognitive, and social domains. It is the conserved quantity of "form" itself.
pirouette_definition: |
  The conserved quantity, derived via the Noether–Pirouette correspondence, that arises from the symmetry of scale invariance in the temporal pressure field (Γ) of the Pirouette Lagrangian. It is the third component of the Coherence Conservation Triple {E_C, J_μ, Φ_Γ}, representing a conserved structural pattern independent of interaction density.

        outline: |
          1. Identify a system where the temporal pressure field Γ can be externally controlled and scaled (e.g., attentional load in a cognitive task, interaction frequency in a social network).
          2. Measure the system's other state variables (e.g., coherence C, time adherence T_a) at different scaling factors of Γ.
          3. Compute the value of Φ_Γ from the system's state variables using the constitutive map for the domain.
          4. Verify that the computed Φ_Γ remains constant across the different scaling factors of Γ.
        expected_signals: [A constant value for Φ_Γ in a time-series or cross-sectional measurement as Γ is varied.]
        pitfalls: [Failure to properly isolate the system from external fluxes, misidentification of the correct scaling operator for Γ in a given substrate.]

    excerpt: |
      Three principal symmetries yield three conserved quantities: Temporal Translation Invariance (→) Conservation of Energy-Like Quantity, Phase Invariance (→) Conservation of Coherence Current, and Scale Invariance in (Γ) (→) Conservation of Resonant Potential (Φ_Γ). Collectively, these define the Coherence Conservation Triple, which corresponds to the triadic identity seen in consciousness.
  - module: MATH-024
    excerpt: |
      The universal continuity equation links temporal adherence (persistence), spatial coherence (order), and resonance pressure (interaction density). Conservation of Φ_Γ implies that a system can change its interaction density (Γ) without violating its fundamental structural integrity, so long as other fields compensate. This is critical for understanding resilience and adaptation.

      justification: |
        The dilatation charge is the conserved Noether charge corresponding to the symmetry of scale invariance (dilatations) in a field theory. Resonant Potential Φ_Γ is explicitly defined as the conserved charge from scale invariance in the field Γ, making this a direct mathematical analogy. The primary difference is that Pirouette's scaling applies to an internal field (Γ) rather than spacetime coordinates.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from energetic potentials (e.g., gravitational potential). Resonant Potential is not a source of force in the same way; it is a conserved charge, a quantity that remains constant due to a system's underlying symmetry, more akin to electric charge or angular momentum.

# Resonant Potential

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The conserved quantity, derived via the Noether–Pirouette correspondence, that arises from the symmetry of scale invariance in the temporal pressure field (Γ) of the Pirouette Lagrangian. It is the third component of the Coherence Conservation Triple {E_C, J_μ, Φ_Γ}, representing a conserved structural pattern independent of interaction density.

## EFT-First Summary
Resonant Potential (Φ_Γ) is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the **dilatation charge** found in scale-invariant effective field theories. Just as the dilatation charge is the conserved quantity associated with the symmetry of scaling space-time coordinates, Φ_Γ is the conserved quantity associated with the symmetry of scaling the internal temporal pressure field (Γ). Its conservation implies that a system's core dynamics can be invariant to the overall 'intensity' or 'density' of its internal interactions, providing a basis for structural stability across different energy regimes.
