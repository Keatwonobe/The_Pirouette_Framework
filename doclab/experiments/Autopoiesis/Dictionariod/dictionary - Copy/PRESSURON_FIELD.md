      snippet: |
        Formalize the **thermal history** of the Γ field from inflationary initial conditions through BBN and recombination, specify how its background and perturbations enter a Boltzmann code (CLASS/CAMB branch), and define **falsifiable targets** in ΔN_eff, CMB spectra, and late-time equation-of-state evolution.

  art: |
    Γ begins frozen, takes its first breath when H ~ m_Γ, and then beats like a hidden metronome that matter can’t hear—until the tail in V(Γ) slows the drum at late times, whispering as dark energy. These stages are one score, played on a single instrument.
  law: |
    The field’s evolution is fixed by a one-shot parameter freeze. Its predictions for ΔN_eff, CMB spectra (TT/TE/EE/ISW), and structure growth (fσ_8(z)) must remain consistent with BBN, Planck, and LSS data respectively. Failure to unify observations under a single parameter set falsifies the model.
  philosophy: |
    The Pressuron field aims to resolve the cosmological coincidence problem by embodying both dark matter and dark energy within a single dynamical entity. Its conceptual role is to replace two separate, unexplained dark sector components with one unified field whose evolution naturally transitions from a matter-like to an energy-like state.
pirouette_definition: |
  A canonical scalar field (Γ) that unifies the dark sector. Initialized by a misalignment mechanism, its energy density scales as matter (⟨w_Γ⟩ ≈ 0) during the radiation and matter eras due to rapid oscillations in its potential. At late times, a shallow "tail" in the potential V(Γ) induces slow-roll dynamics, causing the field to behave as dark energy (w_Γ ≈ -1) and drive cosmic acceleration.

        outline: |
          Integrate the Pressuron field's background and perturbation equations within a modified Boltzmann code (e.g., CLASS/CAMB). Fit the resulting theoretical power spectra (CMB TT/TE/EE, lensing) and background expansion history to cosmological data (Planck, BAO, SNe Ia). Constrain the field parameters (m_Γ, initial conditions, potential tail parameters) via statistical inference.
        expected_signals: [A non-zero effective number of relativistic species (ΔN_eff lesssim 0.3), a specific late-time Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect signature in the low-ℓ CMB spectrum, a characteristic evolution of the growth of structure (fσ_8(z)) differing from ΛCDM.]
        pitfalls: [Degeneracies with other cosmological parameters (e.g., H₀, Ω_m), mismodeling of the potential V(Γ) tail, numerical artifacts from switching between stiff and averaged solvers.]

    excerpt: |
      We assume **misalignment** initial conditions: the homogeneous Γ background starts displaced from the potential minimum; Hubble friction freezes it ( (\dot\Gamma \approx 0) ) until (H \approx m_\Gamma). Thereafter (\Gamma) oscillates and time-averages to a pressureless fluid ( ( \langle p_\Gamma \rangle \simeq 0 ) ), i.e., CDM-like behavior.

      **CMB inconsistency:** If TT/TE/EE+lensing require adding **independent CDM/DE fluids** after parameters are frozen, the **unification fails**. (Cosmology falsification clause already written in COSMO-Γ.)

        This is the most accurate description, as the model's core purpose is to unify the roles of both dark matter (via early-time oscillations) and dark energy (via late-time slow-roll) into a single degree of freedom, Γ. It subsumes aspects of both Quintessence and ALP models.

# Pressuron Field

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A canonical scalar field (Γ) that unifies the dark sector. Initialized by a misalignment mechanism, its energy density scales as matter (⟨w_Γ⟩ ≈ 0) during the radiation and matter eras due to rapid oscillations in its potential. At late times, a shallow "tail" in the potential V(Γ) induces slow-roll dynamics, causing the field to behave as dark energy (w_Γ ≈ -1) and drive cosmic acceleration.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pressuron field is a Unified Dark Sector model that behaves identically to an Axion-like Particle (ALP) at early times and a Quintessence field at late times. Its initial energy density is set by the misalignment mechanism, where it acts as cold dark matter. As the universe expands, a non-polynomial tail in its potential becomes dominant, causing it to slow-roll and source cosmic acceleration. This unification provides a potential solution to the cosmological coincidence problem.
