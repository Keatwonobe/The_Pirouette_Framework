    The static between stations, the murmur of a crowd, or the chaos of a market—not as random noise, but as a chorus of latent symphonies awaiting a conductor.
  law: |
    A system's rate of novel pattern discovery is directly proportional to its bandwidth of attunement and the density of latent coherent structures within its ambient Temporal Pressure field.
  philosophy: |
    Noisy Signal reframes the external world from a source of disruptive chaos into a reservoir of unexpressed potential. It posits that all meaningful transformation originates not from a void, but from the selective integration of pre-existing, hidden order.

        SR describes a phenomenon where a system's ability to detect a weak periodic signal is enhanced by an optimal level of noise. This aligns with Noisy Signal, where ambient Temporal Pressure (noise) is a necessary medium containing latent patterns (the weak signal) that a prepared system can resonate with. The environment is not an obstacle to be filtered out, but a substrate that enables detection.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'Noisy Signal' is not a signal corrupted by noise. It is the 'noise' *itself* viewed as a carrier of latent signals. The key distinction is that coherent patterns are inherent *to* the structure of the noise, not an external signal *added* to it.

# Noisy Signal

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A region of high but structured Temporal Pressure (Γ) that is not purely stochastic. It contains a high density of latent, coherent sub-patterns and stochastic opportunities that can be coupled with by a sufficiently resonant system to induce a transformative Alchemical Union.

## EFT-First Summary
Noisy Signal is conceptually analogous to environments exhibiting Stochastic Resonance, where ambient noise enhances the detection of weak, coherent signals. A system immersed in such an environment can leverage the chaotic fluctuations to achieve a resonant coupling with a latent pattern, an event impossible in either a pure-signal or pure-noise regime. This reframes environmental chaos as a necessary substrate for discovery, not merely an obstacle to be filtered. (Ref: Gammaitoni et al., *Rev. Mod. Phys. 70*, 1998).
