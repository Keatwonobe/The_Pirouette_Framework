        When we analyze the Lagrangian in this context, the dimensionless ratio of the "kinetic" coherence term (from the field's gradient) to the "potential" pressure term (from the field's presence) is given by the eigenvalue `l(l+1)`.

  art: |
    The tension on a drum's skin before it is struck. It is the price of a pattern, the geometric stress required for a surface to sing a note instead of lying silent. This cost is the first resistance of form against formlessness.
  law: |
    For any stable resonant pattern on a spherical boundary decomposable into spherical harmonics `Y_lm`, the dimensionless Surface Dynamic Cost is the eigenvalue `l(l+1)`, where `l` is a non-negative integer mode index. The simplest dynamic mode (`l=1`) has a cost of 2.
  philosophy: |
    This quantifies the inherent price of complexity. A uniform state (`l=0`) is "free," but to create a dynamic distinction—a pole, a gradient, a pattern—requires a system to pay a geometric cost. This cost is not arbitrary but is quantized by the topology of the arena itself, establishing the first rung on the ladder of form.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dimensionless measure of the intrinsic cost to sustain a dynamic resonant pattern on a spherical boundary. Derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian as the ratio of kinetic coherence (field gradient) to potential pressure (field presence) for a given mode, it is mathematically identical to the eigenvalue `l(l+1)` of the corresponding spherical harmonic `Y_lm` that describes the pattern's geometry. The fundamental cost for any dynamic pattern is 2, corresponding to the `l=1` dipole mode.

        outline: |
          1. For a system exhibiting a resonant surface pattern (e.g., stellar pulsation, particle wave function), measure the field's spatial distribution over the surface.
          2. Perform a spectral decomposition of this field data into a basis of spherical harmonics (`Y_lm`).
          3. Identify the dominant integer `l` value from the decomposition's power spectrum.
          4. Calculate the cost as `l(l+1)`.
        expected_signals: [Characteristic multipolar field geometry (dipolar for `l=1`, quadrupolar for `l=2`), quantized power spectrum peaks corresponding to integer `l` values.]
        pitfalls: [Measurement noise obscuring the true mode shape, mode mixing where multiple `l` values are simultaneously present and interfere, insufficient angular resolution to distinguish high-`l` modes.]

    excerpt: |
      Any resonant pattern on the sphere can be decomposed into a basis of spherical harmonics (`Y_lm`). When we analyze the Lagrangian in this context, the dimensionless ratio of the "kinetic" coherence term...to the "potential" pressure term...is given by the eigenvalue `l(l+1)`. This ratio measures the intrinsic efficiency of a pattern on the surface. For `l=1` (a dipole), the ratio is `1(1+1) = 2`. This is the simplest possible *dynamic* pattern...This value, `2`, represents the fundamental cost of maintaining a dynamic pattern on a surface.

    excerpt: |
      The total geometric character of the fundamental resonant mode is the product of its dynamic surface cost and its volumetric leverage. This defines the fundamental geometric constant of resonance, `Κ_g`.
      `Κ_g = (Surface Dynamic Cost) × (Volumetric Leverage) = 2 × (R/3) = 2R/3`

      justification: |
        The Surface Dynamic Cost is a direct physical interpretation of the eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the 2-sphere. This operator quantifies the "curvature" or "kinetic energy" of a scalar field on the sphere's surface, which maps directly to the ratio of kinetic to potential terms in the Pirouette Lagrangian's surface analysis.

      justification: |
        In quantum mechanics, the operator for the square of the orbital angular momentum is `L² = -ħ²∇²_S²`. Its eigenvalues `ħ²l(l+1)` represent the quantized magnitude of angular momentum. The Surface Dynamic Cost is the dimensionless core of this value, `l(l+1)`, representing the purely geometric contribution to the system's rotational energy or dynamic complexity.

      rationale: This is the most direct and fundamental mathematical mapping, free of physical constants like `ħ` or interpretations specific to quantum mechanics, aligning perfectly with the first-principles geometric derivation in DOMA-091.

      falsifier: "Discovery of a fundamental, stable, self-generated resonant system whose simplest dynamic mode corresponds to a non-integer `l` or an integer `l` other than 1. Or, a system where the costs of higher modes do not scale as `l(l+1)`."

  collisions: [The term "cost" is common in optimization and computer science (e.g., cost function), but here it is a specific, dimensionless physical quantity derived from a Lagrangian.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from energy, which has units. The Surface Dynamic Cost is a dimensionless ratio inherent to the geometry of the pattern, not the total energy required to power it, which would depend on amplitude and scale. It is a measure of *shape*, not *substance*.
