        Dissonance Echo Cascade: If the Gambit generates unintended chaotic resonance (`DE ≥ DE_critical`) that begins to self-amplify, the Harmonic Dampening protocol is automatically triggered.

  art: |
    The aftershock of a clumsy touch; the system's chaotic cry in response to an intervention it cannot gracefully integrate. It is the sound of a string plucked too hard, vibrating with noise instead of music.
  law: |
    A gambit-induced DE exceeding a pre-defined critical threshold (`DE_critical`) for a given system mandates the immediate activation of the Harmonic Dampening protocol to preserve manifold integrity.
  philosophy: |
    DE quantifies the principle of 'first, do no harm' for systemic interventions. It is the measure of the system's rejection of a gambit, reminding the weaver that even well-intentioned actions can create more chaos than they resolve.
pirouette_definition: |
  A quantitative measure of unintended chaotic resonance generated within a system in response to a Daedalus Gambit. It represents the degree to which an intervention's energy is dissipated into turbulent, non-laminar modes rather than being integrated into the system's coherent flow. High DE values indicate a poorly-attuned gambit that is stressing the system's manifold integrity.

          1. Establish a baseline measurement of the system's flow dynamics using the Flow Dynamics Lens (DYNA-001).
          2. Execute the Daedalus Gambit.
          3. Continuously monitor the system's state space, performing a spectral analysis of its primary flow vectors.
          4. DE is calculated as the integrated power in harmonic frequencies not predicted by the intervention simulation, normalized against the total energy of the gambit.

      justification: |
        DE is conceptually analogous to a positive Lyapunov exponent in a dynamical system. A gambit perturbs the system; if nearby state-space trajectories diverge exponentially (positive λ), it indicates chaos. DE functions as a practical, integrated measure of this chaotic divergence post-intervention.

      falsifier: "Discovering a system where a high-DE gambit (DE > 5 RU) results in a stable or increased LFI, suggesting that some forms of acute, high-energy dissonance can be therapeutic or are misclassified by the current metric."

# Dissonance Echo

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A quantitative measure of unintended chaotic resonance generated within a system in response to a Daedalus Gambit. It represents the degree to which an intervention's energy is dissipated into turbulent, non-laminar modes rather than being integrated into the system's coherent flow. High DE values indicate a poorly-attuned gambit that is stressing the system's manifold integrity.

## EFT-First Summary
There is no adopted mapping for Dissonance Echo at this time. Conceptually, it functions as a practical measure of induced chaos, similar to observing a positive Lyapunov exponent in a dynamical system after a perturbation. It quantifies the degree to which an intervention pushes a system toward chaotic, unpredictable behavior rather than a new, stable equilibrium.
