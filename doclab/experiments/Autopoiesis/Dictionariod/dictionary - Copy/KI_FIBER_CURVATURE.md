    The twisting of internal dimensions, a geometric stain whose density we perceive as charge and whose resistance to change manifests as mass.
  law: |
    The ratio of Ki-fiber curvature to squared Γ-stiffness, scaled by an appropriate power of the energy cutoff, is a renormalization-group invariant ($\mathcal{I}_{\text{mass}} = \frac{\mathcal{K}_F}{\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2}\,\Lambda^{-2(c_2-c_1)} = \text{const}$).
  philosophy: |
    $\mathcal{K}_F$ completes the geometrization of forces by treating charge not as an intrinsic property but as the curvature of a gauge fiber. This reframes the Standard Model's gauge structure as a direct consequence of the geometry of the Ki-bundle, making interactions a manifestation of curvature, parallel to gravity in spacetime.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Ki-Fiber Curvature, $\mathcal{K}_F$, is the temporal average of the squared norm of the gauge field strength tensor, $\mathcal{K}_F = \langle \mathrm{Tr}(\mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu}\mathcal{F}^{\mu\nu}) \rangle_\tau$. It quantifies the local curvature of the internal Ki-fiber bundle, representing the geometric density of gauge charge. Through the Unified Mass–Curvature Correspondence, $\mathcal{K}_F$ contributes to the total mass-energy invariant and is dynamically linked to Γ-stiffness via renormalization group flow.

    excerpt: |
      From XAP-006, the Ki-fiber curvature is $\mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu}= \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu + [A_\mu,A_\nu]$, with norm $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu}\mathcal{F}^{\mu\nu})$. Its τ-average defines an effective curvature density $\mathcal{K}_F = \langle \mathrm{Tr}(F^2) \rangle_\tau$. Gauge boson masses satisfy $m_A^2 = g_N^2\,\xi\,\Gamma_0^2 = g_N^2 \frac{\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2}{\lambda_\Gamma}$. Thus $m_A^2$ scales with both fiber curvature and substrate curvature, unifying charge and mass geometrically.
  - module: XAP-006D
    excerpt: |
      MATH-026 gives $\beta$-functions for both stiffness and gauge curvature: $\frac{d\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2}{d\ln\Lambda} = c_1 g_N^2 \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2$ and $\frac{d\mathcal{K}_F}{d\ln\Lambda} = c_2 g_N^4$. Integrating jointly yields an RG invariant $\mathcal{I}_{\text{mass}} = \frac{\mathcal{K}_F}{\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2}\,\Lambda^{-2(c_2-c_1)} = \text{const}$. This invariant ensures that as the gauge coupling runs, mass and curvature remain proportionally locked—a quantitative expression of “mass from curvature.”

        $\mathcal{K}_F$ is the temporal average of the standard gauge kinetic term Lagrangian density, $\mathcal{L}_{kin} \propto \mathrm{Tr}(F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu})$. It elevates this kinematic term to a geometric invariant representing the curvature of the internal gauge bundle, thus providing a geometric origin for what is typically seen as field energy.

# Ki-Fiber Curvature

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Ki-Fiber Curvature, $\mathcal{K}_F$, is the temporal average of the squared norm of the gauge field strength tensor, $\mathcal{K}_F = \langle \mathrm{Tr}(\mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu}\mathcal{F}^{\mu\nu}) \rangle_\tau$. It quantifies the local curvature of the internal Ki-fiber bundle, representing the geometric density of gauge charge. Through the Unified Mass–Curvature Correspondence, $\mathcal{K}_F$ contributes to the total mass-energy invariant and is dynamically linked to Γ-stiffness via renormalization group flow.

## EFT-First Summary
In Effective Field Theory, Ki-Fiber Curvature $\mathcal{K}_F$ corresponds to the time-averaged gauge field invariant, $\langle \mathrm{Tr}(F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}) \rangle_\tau$. This term, typically interpreted as the kinetic energy of gauge bosons, is re-contextualized in Pirouette as a direct measure of the geometric curvature of the internal gauge bundle. This reinterpretation provides a geometric origin for gauge charge and, through its link to Γ-stiffness, for gauge boson masses.
