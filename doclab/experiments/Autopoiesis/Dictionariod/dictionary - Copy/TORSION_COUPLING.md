    The twist in time's fabric that grants substance to specters. A dragging torsion in the temporal flow makes a fermion heavy, resisting motion. It is the universe's geometric grip on its own creations.
  law: |
    Fermion mass is directly proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the Γ-field (Γ₀). The proportionality constant, Torsion Coupling (yΓ), is set by its unique renormalization group scaling dimension (ΔT), which differs for each fermion generation.
  philosophy: |
    Torsion Coupling grounds fermion mass in the same geometric substrate (the Γ-field) that governs temporal coherence and gauge boson mass. It replaces the Standard Model's ad-hoc set of Yukawa couplings with a dynamic principle of temporal elasticity, aiming to explain mass hierarchies from first principles.
pirouette_definition: |
  A fundamental, dimensionless coupling constant, denoted yΓ, that mediates a direct interaction between a fermion field Ψ and the scalar Γ-field. The term `-yΓ Γ \bar\Psi Ψ` in the Pirouette Lagrangian `CORE-006` is responsible for generating fermion mass `mf` when the Γ-field acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value `Γ₀`, such that `mf = yΓ Γ₀`. The coupling `yΓ` runs with the energy scale Λ according to a scaling dimension `ΔT` (i.e., `yΓ(Λ) ∝ Λ^(ΔT)`), a mechanism that naturally produces mass hierarchies between fermion generations.

        outline: |
          1. Precisely measure the rest masses of two fermions, `mf₁` and `mf₂`.
          2. Measure the vacuum expectation value of the Γ-field, `Γ₀`, by measuring a gauge boson mass (e.g., `m_W = g_W Γ₀`).
          3. Calculate each coupling via `yΓᵢ = mfᵢ / Γ₀`. The ratio `yΓ₁ / yΓ₂` must match predictions from the renormalization group flow governed by their respective scaling dimensions `ΔT₁` and `ΔT₂`.
        expected_signals:
          - A consistent value for `Γ₀` derived from multiple vector boson masses.
          - Observed fermion mass ratios consistent with RG flow from a single UV scale.
        pitfalls:
          - The local value of `Γ₀` may vary with ambient coherence density, requiring environmental characterization.
          - Higher-order corrections to the RG flow could complicate the relationship.

    excerpt: |
      Fermionic Ki-modes couple to Γ through a torsion term... The expectation value Γ₀ gives `m_f = yΓ Γ₀`, and since `yΓ` renormalizes under the flow of MATH-026 as `yΓ(Λ) ∝ Λ^(ΔT)`, mass hierarchies among generations emerge naturally from differing torsion scaling dimensions `ΔT`.
  - module: XAP-006C
    excerpt: |
      Fermion hierarchies derive from torsion scaling exponent ΔT. Variations of Γ₀ with ambient coherence predict small temperature-dependent shifts in particle masses—potentially measurable in precision cold-beam experiments. This provides an experimental hook for verifying the `yΓ Γ` mass generation mechanism.

      justification: |
        In the Standard Model, fermion masses arise from Yukawa couplings (`y_f`) to the Higgs field (`H`). The Torsion Coupling `yΓ` plays the same functional role, with the Γ-field's VEV `Γ₀` replacing the Higgs VEV `v`. The key difference is that Pirouette aims to predict the `yΓ` values from RG scaling dimensions rather than treating them as arbitrary inputs.

      confidence: 0.9
  adopted:
    - target: Yukawa Coupling (y_f)
      rationale: The Lagrangian term is structurally and functionally identical to the SM Yukawa term after symmetry breaking. It directly generates a mass term `mf = yΓ Γ₀` that is the analogue of `mf = yf v`.

  disambiguation: |
    Torsion Coupling should not be confused with gravitational torsion in Einstein-Cartan theory. In Pirouette, 'torsion' is a metaphor for a drag interaction with the temporal substrate, not a property of the spacetime affine connection.

# Torsion Coupling

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A fundamental, dimensionless coupling constant, denoted yΓ, that mediates a direct interaction between a fermion field Ψ and the scalar Γ-field. The term `-yΓ Γ \bar\Psi Ψ` in the Pirouette Lagrangian `CORE-006` is responsible for generating fermion mass `mf` when the Γ-field acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value `Γ₀`, such that `mf = yΓ Γ₀`. The coupling `yΓ` runs with the energy scale Λ according to a scaling dimension `ΔT` (i.e., `yΓ(Λ) ∝ Λ^(ΔT)`), a mechanism that naturally produces mass hierarchies between fermion generations.

## EFT-First Summary
The Torsion Coupling `yΓ` is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the Standard Model's Yukawa coupling. It generates fermion mass `mf` through the interaction `-yΓ Γ \bar\Psi Ψ`, where the Γ-field's vacuum expectation value `Γ₀ ≈ 250 GeV` plays the role of the Higgs VEV. Unlike the SM, the values of `yΓ` for different fermions are not arbitrary inputs but are determined by their renormalization group flow, providing a geometric origin for the observed mass hierarchy.
