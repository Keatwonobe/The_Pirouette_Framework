  art: |
    The fundamental sensitivity of matter to the whispers of the Temporal Forge. It is the master volume knob setting how loudly the universe's baseline hum is heard by its most elementary particles.
  law: |
    The Pressuron-induced contribution to the electron's anomalous magnetic moment is directly proportional to the Base Strength squared: Δa_e = (α / 12π²) κ² f(m_Γ/m_e). Its value is determined by fitting to the muon anomaly (Δa_μ) and bounded by precision measurements of Δa_e.
  philosophy: |
    κ establishes a fundamental, non-universal interaction scale. Its existence posits that the 'charge' for the temporal pressure interaction is not uniform, but anchored to the lightest stable lepton, providing a root for the observed mass hierarchy's influence on interactions.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Base Strength, κ, is the fundamental, dimensionless Yukawa coupling constant for the electron-Pressuron (Γ) interaction. It defines the interaction strength for the lightest stable lepton (g_e ≡ κ) and serves as the base scale for the couplings of heavier leptons (g_ℓ), which are hypothesized to scale with mass.

        outline: |
          1. Precisely measure the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron (a_e) and muon (a_μ).
          2. Attribute the deviation from Standard Model predictions (Δa_ℓ) to the Pressuron interaction.
          3. Assuming values for the mass-scaling exponent (p) and Pressuron mass (m_Γ), solve the equation Δa_μ = (α / 12π²) κ² (m_μ/m_e)²ᵖ f(m_Γ/m_μ) for κ.
          4. Verify that this value of κ does not predict a Δa_e that violates the experimental bounds on a_e.

      justification: |
        κ is defined as the dimensionless coupling in a Yukawa-type interaction term between a scalar field (the Pressuron, Γ) and a Dirac fermion (the electron). This is a direct analog to standard Yukawa couplings in quantum field theory that give rise to mass or other interactions.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the lepton-specific coupling `g_ℓ`. The Base Strength `κ` is a single, universal parameter, while `g_ℓ` is a derived, particle-dependent quantity (g_e = κ, g_μ = κ(m_μ/m_e)ᵖ, etc.).
