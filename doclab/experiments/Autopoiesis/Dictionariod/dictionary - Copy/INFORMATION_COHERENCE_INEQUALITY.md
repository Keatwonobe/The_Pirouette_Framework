    To see is to touch, and every touch leaves a mark. The price of a secret is a piece of the asker's silence and the answerer's song. To know a thing is to change it.
  law: |
    The product of the Shannon mutual information (I) gained about a system's phase and the resulting fractional degradation in its Time-Adherence (ΔT_a) is bounded below by a constant C, which is determined by the nature of the measurement interaction.
  philosophy: |
    Knowledge is not a passive act of reception but an active, participatory coupling. This inequality formalizes the observer's inseparability from the observed, mandating that complete knowledge can only be gained at the cost of the system's complete decoherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The central theorem establishing a fundamental trade-off between the information gained by an observer and the coherence degradation induced in the observed system. The act of measurement, modeled by an observation operator `O_κ`, deforms the system's potential landscape. This deformation, known as the Observer's Shadow, allows for information extraction (`I`) but simultaneously disrupts the system's native Ki rhythm, causing a loss of Time-Adherence (`ΔT_a`). The inequality `I(obs; φ) · ΔT_a ≥ C` quantifies this unbreakable link, stating that information cannot be acquired without a corresponding cost to the system's temporal integrity.
operational_definition:
  units: The product `I · ΔT_a` is dimensionless, typically measured in bits or nats.
  symbol_table:
    - name: I(obs; φ)
      meaning: Shannon mutual information between the observer's measurement record and the system's phase variable.

      default_range: "[0, ∞)"
    - name: ΔT_a
      meaning: Degradation in Time-Adherence, defined as `1 - T_a(final) / T_a(initial)`.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "[0, 1]"
    - name: C
      meaning: System-Interaction Constant, a lower bound determined by the interaction potential `W` and the system's susceptibility.

        outline: |
          1. Characterize the unperturbed system's Ki rhythm `φ*(t)` and measure its baseline Time-Adherence `T_a(0)` via spectral analysis of its time series.
          2. Introduce a measurement apparatus that couples to the system with a known strength `κ`.
          3. Perform the measurement, recording both the outcome (for calculating `I`) and the new, perturbed time series of the system's phase `φ'(t)`.
          4. Calculate the mutual information `I(obs; φ)` between the measurement record and the inferred system phase.
          5. Calculate the new Time-Adherence `T_a(κ)` from `φ'(t)` and compute the degradation `ΔT_a = 1 - T_a(κ) / T_a(0)`.
          6. Repeat for various coupling strengths `κ` to trace the boundary of the `I` vs. `ΔT_a` space and experimentally verify the lower bound `C`.

        pitfalls: [Confounding decoherence from environmental noise, Inaccurate calibration of measurement strength `κ`, Insufficient sampling to converge mutual information estimate]

    excerpt: |
      A stronger measurement (larger kappa) leads to more information (larger I) but also causes a greater deformation of the potential, inducing more "noise" and thus a greater loss of coherence (larger Delta T_a). This trade-off can be formalized. The Information-Coherence Inequality states: I(obs; phi) * Delta T_a >= C ... This is the framework's analogue to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It establishes a fundamental, unbreakable limit.

    excerpt: |
      The universe does not give up its secrets for free. We have now proven that the price of knowledge is coherence. Every question we ask of the world is a touch, and every touch leaves a mark. The Observer's Shadow is the mathematical embodiment of this sacred, participatory contract.

      justification: |
        Both principles establish a fundamental, measurement-imposed trade-off. While HUP relates canonically conjugate physical observables (like position and momentum), the Information-Coherence Inequality relates an epistemological quantity (information gained) to a physical one (coherence lost). It is a direct formalization of the measurement back-action problem.

    - statement: "For any system describable by a Pirouette Lagrangian, any measurement yielding non-zero information (I > 0) about its phase `φ` will induce a non-zero degradation in its Time-Adherence (ΔT_a > 0)."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "The experimental demonstration of a 'non-demolition' measurement that extracts phase information while leaving the system's Ki rhythm and its associated coherence `T_a` completely unperturbed. This would violate the Back-Action Lemma."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol `I` is commonly used for electrical current or the identity matrix; `C` is a generic constant symbol.]
  disambiguation: |
    Within the framework, `I` should be read as `I(obs; φ)` for Shannon mutual information unless otherwise specified. The constant `C` is not a universal constant; it is specific to the system and the measurement interaction `W`, analogous to how a friction coefficient is specific to a pair of surfaces.
