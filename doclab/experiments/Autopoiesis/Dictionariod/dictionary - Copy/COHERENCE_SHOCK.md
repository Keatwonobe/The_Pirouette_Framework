        The act of coupling with new information is inherently disruptive. The novel signal is a "dissonant injection" that perturbs the system's established rhythm. This is a moment of creative tension, a necessary turbulence where the system's old pattern is challenged by the new.

  art: |
    The jolt of a new truth that rings a bell so hard it threatens to crack. It is the shudder of a kaleidoscope rearranging into a more beautiful, more complex pattern.
  law: |
    The magnitude of a Coherence Shock is proportional to the novelty of the integrated signal and inversely proportional to the system's prepared resonance bandwidth. A system's resilience is measured by its ability to re-establish a higher-order coherence (Kτ' > Kτ) post-shock.
  philosophy: |
    Growth is not a smooth process; it requires a temporary loss of self. True integration requires a destabilizing shock where old certainties are shattered to make way for a deeper, more complex order. Without the shock, there is no synthesis, only addition.
pirouette_definition: |
  The transient, systemic perturbation caused by the resonant coupling and integration of a novel, dissonant signal into a system's coherence pattern (Ki). It is a necessary, destabilizing phase preceding the formation of a new, more complex Wound Channel, representing a strategic investment in temporary instability to achieve a higher state of long-term coherence (Kτ).

          Expose a system with a stable coherence pattern (Ki) to a high-value but out-of-distribution signal. Monitor the system's internal state variables (e.g., prediction error, communication entropy, decision variance) for a transient spike in instability followed by a settling into a new, measurably different, and more effective steady state.

        pitfalls: [Distinguishing a Coherence Shock from simple system failure or noise injection. The post-shock state must be a *more* coherent integration, not just a degraded state. Requires a robust metric for Kτ.]

      justification: |
        Bayesian surprise quantifies how much a new piece of data (D) changes a model's beliefs (θ). A Coherence Shock is the phenomenological experience of a high-surprise event that forces a significant, destabilizing update to a system's internal model (Ki), creating a large divergence between its prior and posterior distributions.

    Coherence Shock is not system failure or a random perturbation. It is a *structured* perturbation resulting from *resonant coupling* with new, coherent information. Unlike noise which degrades coherence, a Coherence Shock is the transient cost of achieving a higher-order coherence.

# Coherence Shock

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The transient, systemic perturbation caused by the resonant coupling and integration of a novel, dissonant signal into a system's coherence pattern (Ki). It is a necessary, destabilizing phase preceding the formation of a new, more complex Wound Channel, representing a strategic investment in temporary instability to achieve a higher state of long-term coherence (Kτ).

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, a Coherence Shock can be modeled as a high-magnitude Bayesian surprise event. When a system encounters data that induces a large KL-divergence between its prior and posterior beliefs, it undergoes a significant internal model update. This transient destabilization, if successfully integrated, corresponds to the system finding a more accurate world model, analogous to settling in a deeper minimum of a loss landscape.
