  art: |
    Amidst the ceaseless becoming of the fabric, a symmetry in the law of growth imparts a steady beat. This conserved rhythm, a count that does not drift, is the echo of an underlying balance—the signature of a persistent form.
  law: |
    If the action functional (S) is invariant under the automorphism group of a motif (M), then the count of (M) occurrences, when corrected for its expected local drift, is a martingale. This means its expected future value is its present value; it is a conserved quantity of the stochastic growth process.
  philosophy: |
    The Martingale is Pirouette's analogue to Noether's theorem, translating discrete symmetries in the microscopic laws of becoming into macroscopic conserved quantities. This principle is the origin of stability and identity, explaining how persistent structures like particles can emerge from a purely combinatorial and probabilistic substrate. It bridges symmetry directly to conservation without requiring a continuous spacetime.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Martingale is a stochastic process, derived from a motif count, whose expected value at the next step, conditioned on the entire history of the fabric's growth, is equal to its current value. Specifically, let `N_M(E_t)` be the count of a motif `M` in fabric `E` at growth step `t`. If the action functional `S` is invariant under the automorphism group `Aut(M)`, then the process `X_t = N_M(E_t) - Σ_{i<t} E[ΔN_M(E_i)]` is a martingale. It represents a conserved quantity arising from a discrete symmetry in the dynamics.

        outline: |
          1.  Select a candidate motif M and an action functional S.
          2.  Analytically or computationally verify that for any fabric E, the change in action `ΔS(E; P)` is invariant for all creation events `C^+_P` that are equivalent under an automorphism of M.
          3.  Run a Monte Carlo simulation of the fabric growth according to the law `P(C^+_P|E) ∝ exp(-ΔS)`.
          4.  At each step `t`, record the motif count `N_M(E_t)`.
          5.  For the constructed time series `N_M(t)`, compute the drift-corrected quantity `M_C(t)`.
          6.  Test if the process `M_C(t)` has zero mean increments, i.e., `E[M_C(t+1) - M_C(t) | E_t] ≈ 0` within statistical error.

        pitfalls: [Failing to correctly identify the full automorphism group `Aut(M)`; insufficient statistics to distinguish drift from noise; finite-size effects mimicking or obscuring the martingale property.]

      justification: |
        Noether's theorem connects a continuous symmetry of the action to a conserved current and its associated charge. The Martingale principle is the discrete, pre-geometric analogue, connecting a discrete symmetry of the growth action (invariance under a motif's automorphism group) to a statistically conserved quantity (the martingale derived from the motif's count). It is the mechanism for generating conserved quantum numbers.

        The conserved quantity constructed from the motif count is, by definition, a martingale process as understood in probability theory. This is not an analogy but a direct application of the mathematical concept to the stochastic evolution of the fabric.

  disambiguation: |
    In the context of the Pirouette Framework, "Martingale" almost always refers specifically to a conserved quantity derived from a motif count due to a symmetry in the action functional. It is not used for arbitrary martingale processes unless specified. The key components are (1) a motif count, (2) a symmetry of S, and (3) the resulting statistical conservation law.
