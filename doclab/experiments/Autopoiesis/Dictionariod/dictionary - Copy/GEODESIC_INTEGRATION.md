      snippet: |
        This module details the transition from structured rehabilitation to the art of 'Geodesic Integration'—the weaving of newfound resilience into the fabric of a joyful, meaningful life. It marks the patient's graduation from following a protocol to becoming the master of their own coherence.

  art: |
    The river of recovery meets the sea of life. The work is no longer healing, but the art of the dance—weaving strength into the vast, unpredictable beauty of daily existence.
  law: |
    A system with a sustained positive Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p > 0) will naturally transition from protocol-driven recovery to spontaneous, joy-seeking integration. Progress is measured by a decreasing reliance on the Coherence Ledger and an increasing frequency of spontaneous, joy-motivated activities.
  philosophy: |
    Geodesic Integration marks the teleological end of recovery: to graduate from being the subject of a protocol to becoming the master of one's own coherence. Its purpose is not just to regain function, but to transform that function into a source of expansive, creative expression.
pirouette_definition: |
  Geodesic Integration is the fourth and final phase of recovery, characterized by the transition from structured rehabilitation to self-directed, joyful living. It is the process of weaving the resilience and coherence gained in earlier phases into the spontaneous, unpredictable fabric of everyday life. This phase is governed by the principle "Joy is Your Compass" and is sustained by the energetic surplus of a consistently positive Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p > 0).
operational_definition:
  units: Qualitative phase transition; progress measured by frequency of spontaneous activity (Hz) and subjective joy (arbitrary units).

      - name: Spontaneity & Joy Audit
        outline: |
          Over a 30-day window, subject tracks (1) the number of times they engage in a spontaneous, unplanned activity and (2) the number of times they engage in a pre-listed 'joy' activity. A successful transition is marked by a week-over-week increase in these frequencies and a concurrent decrease in the use of the Coherence Ledger for routine tracking.
        expected_signals: [Increasing frequency of joyful/spontaneous events, Decreasing reliance on diagnostic tools like the Coherence Ledger]
        pitfalls: [Confusing obligation ('should') with authentic joy ('want'), Helper over-directing action instead of witnessing, which reverts the subject to a patient mindset.]

    excerpt: |
      This final phase of your journey is about that union. It is about taking the strength you have forged and weaving it into the vast, beautiful, and unpredictable sea of your life. This guide... is not a map with a destination, but a compass for a lifetime of exploration. This is no longer the work of recovery; this is the art of the dance.
  - module: DOMA-HLTH-005
    excerpt: |
      Goal 1: Integrate, Don't Isolate. Your strength is not something to be used only during "exercise time." It is a resource that should flow into every corner of your life... Goal 2: Joy is Your Compass. Your guide for what to do is no longer a protocol, but a feeling. The central question now is not "Can I do this?" but "Will this bring me joy?"

      justification: |
        Geodesic Integration frames a well-lived life as a path that extremizes a 'coherence' functional, analogous to the action principle in physics. Having achieved a stable positive Lagrangian (𝓛_p > 0), the system naturally follows a 'path of greatest joy' through the state space of life activities, without external protocol-driven force.
      references: []
      confidence: 0.8
  adopted:
    - target: Geodesic Principle (Action Principle)
      rationale: "The source module explicitly invokes the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) as the 'physics of the dance,' defining this phase as one of energetic surplus. The term 'Geodesic' strongly implies a path-optimization principle, making the mapping to the action principle in classical mechanics both natural and intended."

  claims:
    - statement: "Individuals who maintain a positive Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p > 0) for over 30 days will spontaneously increase engagement in novel or 'joy-list' activities without explicit instruction."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observation of individuals with sustained 𝓛_p > 0 who remain locked in rigid, protocol-bound behaviors and show no increase in spontaneous or joy-seeking activities."

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'Geodesic' does not refer to the curvature of spacetime, but to an optimal *path of living* through a state space of activities. The integration is not mathematical, but the *weaving* of resilience into the fabric of life, analogous to how a geodesic path is integrated from a local Lagrangian.
