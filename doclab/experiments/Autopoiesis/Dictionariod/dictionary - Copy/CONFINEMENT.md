    The universe forges its own arenas, where a system's own song becomes the very walls of its prison. To exist is to build a home from the pressure of your own voice.
  law: |
    Confinement is a scale-dependent feedback phenomenon where a system's coherence expression (K_τ) non-linearly increases local temporal pressure (V_Γ), making boundary-crossing a path of lower coherence than remaining within the boundary.
  philosophy: |
    Confinement is the principle of self-containment that allows stable, hierarchical structures to emerge from a homogenous field. It establishes that to "be" is not merely to propagate, but to establish a bounded, stable domain of existence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The binding of a system to a localized region of spacetime, enforced by a scale-dependent, non-linear feedback loop within the Pirouette Lagrangian. At a boundary, a system's attempt to maintain coherence by increasing its resonant intensity (K_τ) causes a disproportionate spike in local temporal pressure (V_Γ), making escape a path of decoherence. This single mechanism manifests as the strong nuclear force at the quantum scale and gravity at the cosmological scale.

          Measure the energy required to increase the separation distance between two putatively confined entities (e.g., quarks, orbiting bodies). The energy cost should rise non-linearly and disproportionately to the work done against known propagating forces, consistent with a V_Γ feedback loop.

    excerpt: |
      If a quark attempts to move away from its partners, the distance causes their rhythms to desynchronize. To maintain its own coherence, the quark must resonate more intensely. This intensity feeds directly back into the local temporal pressure, causing V_Γ to spike. The "cost" of coherence rises exponentially with distance... trying to flee only populates the arena with more gladiators.
  - module: CORE-008_the_gladiator_force
    excerpt: |
      An orbiting planet is not being "pulled" by a force. It is following the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—within the star's coherence well. To deviate from this orbit would require fighting against the gentle but inexorable gradient of temporal pressure, a path of lower coherence. Gravity is the Gladiator Force acting on a cosmic scale.

      justification: |
        The module directly maps quantum-scale confinement to the strong nuclear force's binding of quarks. The mechanism described—asymptotic freedom at close range and exponentially increasing binding energy with distance, leading to pair production—is a direct analog to the behavior of the color force in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).

    - target: Gravitational binding
      domain: GR
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The module maps cosmological-scale confinement to gravity, where massive objects create 'coherence wells' (analogous to spacetime curvature) that confine orbiting bodies to geodesics. This recasts gravitational attraction as a system following a path of maximal coherence within a pressure gradient.
      confidence: 0.9
  adopted:
    - target: Color confinement (SM) & Gravitational binding (GR)
      rationale: These are adopted as the two scale-dependent manifestations of the single Confinement principle derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'confinement' in plasma physics or other domains. In Pirouette, Confinement is a fundamental force-derivation principle, not a circumstantial effect. It is the active, self-generated binding mechanism, contrasted with being passively trapped by an external potential.

# Confinement

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The binding of a system to a localized region of spacetime, enforced by a scale-dependent, non-linear feedback loop within the Pirouette Lagrangian. At a boundary, a system's attempt to maintain coherence by increasing its resonant intensity (K_τ) causes a disproportionate spike in local temporal pressure (V_Γ), making escape a path of decoherence. This single mechanism manifests as the strong nuclear force at the quantum scale and gravity at the cosmological scale.

## EFT-First Summary
In the Standard Model, Confinement is analogous to **color confinement** in QCD, where the energy required to separate quarks grows linearly with distance, preventing their isolation. At cosmological scales, it maps to **gravitational binding**, where the curvature of spacetime described by General Relativity creates potential wells that trap massive objects in orbits. The Pirouette Framework unifies these as a single, scale-dependent feedback mechanism.
