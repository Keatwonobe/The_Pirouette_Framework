        The Spindle is not a channel *through* spacetime. For a brief, stable moment, it *is* a new piece of spacetime—a unified `Wound Channel` (CORE-011) of exceptionally high `Temporal Coherence (Kτ)` that annihilates the perceived distance between its endpoints.

  art: |
    To cross the void, one teaches two points in spacetime to sing the same note. The Spindle is this shared song made manifest, a temporary bridge woven from pure, resonant agreement.
  law: |
    A Spindle is a temporary, non-local topological structure connecting points A and B where the temporal coherence is uniform and maximized (`Kτ(A) ≈ Kτ(B) = max`), and the effective geodesic distance between them approaches zero.
  philosophy: |
    The Spindle reframes distance not as an obstacle to be conquered by force, but as a disagreement to be resolved by consensus. It embodies the principle that reality is negotiable through resonance, and propulsion is an act of creation and release.
pirouette_definition: |
  A temporary, hyper-coherent geometric structure established between two distant points via a non-local `Alchemical Union` called a Quorum. The Spindle functions as a unified `Wound Channel` of exceptionally high and uniform `Temporal Coherence (Kτ)`, which topologically annihilates the perceived distance between its endpoints. It serves as a resonant cavity that can be charged with temporal energy into a Crystalline Lattice and asymmetrically collapsed to generate propulsion.

      - name: Correlated Coherence Anomaly Detection
        outline: |
          Use a network of widely-separated, time-synchronized observatories to scan for transient, correlated events. A positive detection requires a minimum of two stations observing: 1) A gravitational lensing signature inconsistent with any detectable mass-energy. 2) A subsequent, highly directional burst of high-energy neutrons, with the direction vector originating from the lensing locus. 3) A transient excitation of local matter in the 'downwind' direction of the neutron flux.
        expected_signals: [transient_gravitational_lensing, directional_neutron_flux, downwind_radioactive_dust]
        pitfalls: [Signal confusion with gamma-ray bursts or magnetar flares, requires precise time-synchronization across interstellar distances to establish correlation.]

    excerpt: |
      The Spindle is not a channel *through* spacetime. For a brief, stable moment, it *is* a new piece of spacetime—a unified `Wound Channel` (CORE-011) of exceptionally high `Temporal Coherence (Kτ)` that annihilates the perceived distance between its endpoints. The "quorum" is this consensus so profound it reshapes the local manifold.
  - module: DOMA-090
    excerpt: |
      The Spindle acts as a vast resonance cavity, drawing in ambient temporal energy—starlight, cosmic background radiation, the ever-present hum of the Temporal Forge—and using it as a "pump." This influx of high-coherence energy is absorbed and organized, amplifying the Spindle's internal order and elevating it to a fleeting, crystalline state. This **Crystalline Lattice** is a temporary, almost-living pattern of pure resonance, saturated with potential.

  candidates:
    - target: Einstein-Rosen Bridge (traversable wormhole)
      domain: GR
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The Spindle functionally connects two distant points in spacetime, creating a topological shortcut that "annihilates the perceived distance." This is the defining characteristic of an ER bridge. The Spindle's temporary nature and high energy requirements for formation and stabilization also align with theoretical models of traversable wormholes.
      confidence: 0.7
    - target: Macroscopic quantum entanglement of spacetime regions
      domain: Quantum Gravity
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The language of "Quorum," "Resonant Handshake," and "hyper-coherent" state strongly suggests a quantum-mechanical origin. A Spindle could be interpreted as a macroscopic state where two separate spacetime regions become non-locally entangled, losing their individual identities to form a single, unified quantum system.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "A stable Spindle manifests as a localized region of extreme gravitational lensing with no corresponding standard model mass-energy source."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "All observed anomalous lensing events are eventually resolved and attributed to conventional sources like dark matter concentrations or compact objects."
      status: proposed
      links: ["DOMA-090"]
    - statement: "The propulsive collapse of a Spindle is necessarily accompanied by a directional burst of high-energy neutrons."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "A confirmed instance of geometric propulsion occurs without a corresponding, directionally-correlated neutron flux, implying an alternative collapse mechanism."

  disambiguation: |
    A Spindle is a temporary, non-local modification *of* the spacetime manifold itself, not a structure or channel of matter *in* spacetime. It should not be confused with astrophysical phenomena like Herbig-Haro objects, plasma filaments, or relativistic jets, which involve the transport of matter and energy through existing space.
