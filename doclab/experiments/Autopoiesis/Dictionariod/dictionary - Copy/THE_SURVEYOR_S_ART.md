    How does one map a river's course from a handful of water? The Surveyor's Art reframes sparse data not as random samples, but as footprints left on a hidden landscape, allowing one to sketch the invisible terrain of a system's dynamics.
  law: |
    Given a time-ordered set of sparse state observations, the system's dynamic state (Laminar, Turbulent, Resilient Struggle, Coherence Erosion) can be inferred by assessing the qualitative relationship between its path's internal rhythm (a proxy for Temporal Coherence, K_τ) and its path's overall dispersion (a proxy for Temporal Pressure, V_Γ).
  philosophy: |
    This protocol shifts the goal from estimating discrete parameters to achieving a rich, qualitative diagnosis of a system's dynamic state. It treats inference not as a statistical problem, but as an act of inverse physics: using a system's observed path to infer the shape of the Lagrangian that governs it.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Surveyor's Art is a diagnostic protocol for inferring a system's underlying coherence manifold and classifying its dynamic state (per DYNA-001) from sparse, time-ordered data points. It operates by treating observations as waypoints on a geodesic path, then qualitatively assessing the path's rhythm and dispersion as proxies for the Temporal Coherence (K_τ) and Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) terms of the system's Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

          1. **Posit Geodesic**: Connect sparse data points to form a tentative trajectory.
          2. **Assess Rhythm (K_τ)**: Analyze path periodicity and variance to infer internal coherence (the "song").
          3. **Assess Pressure (V_Γ)**: Analyze path dispersion and volatility to infer environmental resistance (the "storm").
          4. **Synthesize Diagnosis**: Combine K_τ and V_Γ assessments to classify the system into one of four dynamic states (Laminar, Turbulent, etc.).

        pitfalls: [Misinterpreting measurement noise as a low-K_τ signal, aliasing effects from extremely sparse sampling, assuming a single geodesic when the system is mode-switching.]

    excerpt: |
      How does one map a river's course from a handful of water? The old framework sought to estimate discrete parameters from sparse data, an act akin to guessing the river's depth from the color of a single stone. This module replaces that outdated practice with a more profound approach: The Surveyor's Art.
  - module: DOMA-186
    excerpt: |
      This entire protocol is a heuristic for solving an inverse problem. Standard physics uses the Lagrangian to predict the path; the Surveyor's Art uses the path to infer the Lagrangian. The final diagnostic statement—"The data suggests a system in a state of Resilient Struggle"—is a direct, physical claim about its governing dynamics.

        Standard mechanics calculates a trajectory from a known Lagrangian. This protocol does the reverse, inferring qualitative properties of the Lagrangian (the "landscape") from a sparsely sampled trajectory. This is analogous to inverse problems in fields like geophysics or system identification.

# The Surveyor's Art

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Surveyor's Art is a diagnostic protocol for inferring a system's underlying coherence manifold and classifying its dynamic state (per DYNA-001) from sparse, time-ordered data points. It operates by treating observations as waypoints on a geodesic path, then qualitatively assessing the path's rhythm and dispersion as proxies for the Temporal Coherence (K_τ) and Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) terms of the system's Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

## EFT-First Summary
The Surveyor's Art is best understood as a heuristic for solving an **Inverse Problem**. Whereas classical mechanics uses a known Lagrangian `L` to predict a system's path, this protocol uses a sparsely observed path to infer qualitative properties of `L`. This conceptual reversal allows for a deep diagnosis of system dynamics even from minimal information, mirroring techniques in system identification and geophysics.
