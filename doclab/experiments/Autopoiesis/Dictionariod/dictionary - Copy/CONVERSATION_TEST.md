        The "Conversation Test": The right pace is one where you can comfortably hold a conversation without becoming breathless. If you are gasping for air, you are moving too fast. This is your body's natural speedometer.

triad:
  art: |
    The body finds its own gentle song. The rhythm of breath and voice becomes the metronome, guiding the first steps of the recovery dance not by force, but by listening.
  law: |
    A walking pace is within the therapeutic window for rhythm-building if and only if the patient can speak in complete, unstrained sentences. The onset of strained or fragmented speech marks the upper boundary of sustainable intensity.
  philosophy: |
    This test replaces external, rigid metrics with an internal, intuitive biofeedback loop. It grounds recovery in human connection‚Äîthe shared dialogue‚Äîmaking the Helper a Pacesetter, not just an observer. This fosters Coherence Seeding by prioritizing the body's own signals over abstract targets.
pirouette_definition: |
  A biofeedback protocol used during the Geodesic Walk to calibrate a sustainable aerobic pace for Phase II recovery. It uses the ability to maintain comfortable, coherent conversation as the primary real-time indicator of appropriate intensity. The test is actively managed by a Helper (in the Pacesetter role), who engages the patient in light conversation and monitors their speech quality for signs of strain, thus ensuring the activity remains within the rhythm-building, not stress-inducing, domain.

      - name: Pacesetter-Monitored Conversation Test
        outline: |
          1. Patient initiates a Geodesic Walk with their designated Helper/Pacesetter.
          2. The Helper initiates and maintains a light, continuous conversation, prompting responses that require full sentences.
          3. The Helper actively listens to the patient's speech quality, cadence, and breath sounds.
          4. If speech becomes strained, fragmented, or the patient is audibly breathless, the Helper signals to slow the pace.
          5. The pace is modulated downward until the patient's conversational ability returns to a comfortable baseline.
        expected_signals: [Fluid, complete sentences; rhythmic, non-labored breathing]
        pitfalls: [Patient masking exertion to appear "stronger"; monosyllabic conversation that doesn't challenge the respiratory system; environmental noise obscuring subtle vocal strain.]

    excerpt: |
      Helper's Role (The Pacesetter): Walk With Them: Walk beside the patient, matching their pace. Your steady presence is a non-verbal encouragement. Be the Conversation: Your job is to manage the "Conversation Test." Keep them engaged in a light, pleasant conversation. If their speech becomes strained, it's a clear signal to slow down.

        Pace(Conversation_Test) ‚âà Pace(@VT1)
      justification: |
        The Talk Test is a well-validated proxy for estimating the first ventilatory threshold (VT1), the point at which breathing frequency begins to increase without a corresponding rise in blood lactate. This intensity level is ideal for building aerobic base and is sustainable for long durations, aligning perfectly with the goal of gentle, consistent rhythm-building in Phase II recovery. The onset of strained speech correlates strongly with crossing VT1.

      confidence: 0.95
  adopted:
    - target: Ventilatory Threshold 1 (VT1)
      rationale: The operational definition and therapeutic goal of the Conversation Test are functionally identical to the use of the Talk Test as a proxy for VT1 in clinical settings like cardiac rehabilitation.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "The pace established by the Conversation Test is sufficient to promote positive physiological adaptation (e.g., improved Temporal Coherence) without inducing a state of net energetic cost (i.e., maintaining a positive Lagrangian ùìõ_p)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Longitudinal data from Coherence Ledgers shows that patients adhering strictly to the Conversation Test exhibit a declining Flow Score or a chronically elevated Resting Heart Rate, indicating the intensity is either too low to be adaptive or too high to be restorative."

  disambiguation: |
    While operationally similar to the general "Talk Test," the Pirouette "Conversation Test" is a specific, dyadic protocol. It emphasizes the Helper's active role as a Pacesetter and monitor, framing the test not as a self-assessment of exertion but as a shared act of Coherence Seeding through dialogue.
