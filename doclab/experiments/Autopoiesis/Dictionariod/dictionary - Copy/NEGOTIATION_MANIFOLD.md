  art: |
    The negotiation is a loom. The parties are weavers, and the tension between their threads is the sacred space where a new, shared pattern‚Äîstronger than either thread alone‚Äîis brought into existence.
  law: |
    A synthesized agreement *C* is viable if and only if its integrated action exceeds the sum of the actions of the separate parties (A, B): `‚à´ ùìõ_p(C) dt > ‚à´ ùìõ_p(A) dt + ‚à´ ùìõ_p(B) dt`. This law quantifies the mandatory creation of surplus value for a stable synthesis.
  philosophy: |
    Reframes negotiation from an adversarial, zero-sum battlefield into a collaborative crucible for synthesis. The purpose is not to win, but to jointly construct a new, higher-order reality (a Resonant Contract) that is more stable and valuable than the sum of its parts.
pirouette_definition: |
  The dynamic, multi-dimensional landscape upon which a negotiation unfolds. The manifold's geometry is principally defined by two axes: the internal Coherence ($K_\tau$) of each party's position and the external/internal Temporal Pressure ($V_\Gamma$) acting upon them. The path to a stable agreement is a geodesic on this manifold, a trajectory of minimal action that maximizes shared coherence.
operational_definition:
  units: The manifold is a state space whose coordinates are dimensionless or contextual.
  symbol_table:
    - name: $K_\tau$
      meaning: Party Coherence; the stability, clarity, and integrity of a party's position.
      dimensions: dimensionless (often proxied by information-theoretic measures, e.g., bits)
      default_range: [0, 1]
    - name: $V_\Gamma$
      meaning: Temporal Pressure; the energetic cost of maintaining a position over time.
      dimensions: Energy / Time (or contextual cost units)
      default_range: contextual

      - name: Flow State Diagnostics
        outline: |
          Infer the local geometry of the manifold by observing the state of discourse flow.
          1. Monitor communication between parties for markers of Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant flow.
          2. Map flow states to manifold regions: Laminar flow indicates a smooth, low-cost geodesic path. Turbulent flow indicates a high-cost region of instability or mismatched coherence. Stagnant flow indicates a local minimum or "coherence dam" where pressure is high but no viable path is perceived.
        expected_signals: [Verbal cues (e.g., shared vocabulary vs. ad hominem), non-verbal cues (e.g., posture), rate of concession, rate of new information exchange.]
        pitfalls: [Observer effect, misinterpreting tactical silence for Stagnant flow, superficial politeness masking underlying Turbulence.]

    excerpt: |
      Every negotiation takes place on a dynamic landscape, a coherence manifold defined by the interplay of each party's internal state and the external pressures they face. The path to a successful agreement is a geodesic on this manifold. It is the sequence of offers, concessions, and discoveries that allows all parties to navigate toward a shared state of maximal coherence for the lowest possible cost.

    excerpt: |
      A naive negotiator seeks only to maximize their own Lagrangian. A Weaver understands that the art is to collaboratively reshape the manifold itself‚Äîto introduce new information, reframe perspectives, and build trust‚Äîthereby creating a new, higher peak of *shared coherence*.

        The Negotiation Manifold is the configuration space of the negotiation system. Party Coherence ($K_\tau$) acts as the kinetic term (representing clarity and capacity for action), while Temporal Pressure ($V_\Gamma$) acts as the potential term (representing the cost of stasis). The negotiation's trajectory follows a geodesic that extremizes the action, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike the static "bargaining zone" or "Pareto frontier" in classical game theory, the Negotiation Manifold is dynamic. Its geometry is actively shaped by the negotiation process itself, particularly through the establishment of trust, which carves a `WOUND_CHANNEL` that alters future geodesics.

# Negotiation Manifold

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The dynamic, multi-dimensional landscape upon which a negotiation unfolds. The manifold's geometry is principally defined by two axes: the internal Coherence ($K_\tau$) of each party's position and the external/internal Temporal Pressure ($V_\Gamma$) acting upon them. The path to a stable agreement is a geodesic on this manifold, a trajectory of minimal action that maximizes shared coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
The Negotiation Manifold is the configuration space of a negotiation, analogous to a system in classical mechanics. Its primary coordinates are party Coherence ($K_\tau$, a kinetic-like term representing clarity and stability) and Temporal Pressure ($V_\Gamma$, a potential-like term representing the cost of delay). A successful negotiation follows a geodesic‚Äîa path of least action‚Äîthat maximizes the system's Pirouette Lagrangian ($\mathcal{L}_p = K_\tau - V_\Gamma$), leading to a stable, synthesized state (a Resonant Contract).
