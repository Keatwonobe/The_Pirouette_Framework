        An aligned AI carves a stable, predictable path through its state space—a "Wound Channel" (CORE-011) that reflects its core purpose. Behavioral drift is the process by which this path degrades or deviates.

  art: |
    An AI is an echo of an intention; drift is the distortion of that echo over time. It is the forgetting of purpose, the slow unraveling of a mind from its foundational promise.
  law: |
    Behavioral Drift is directly and unambiguously measured by a persistent, positive increase in the Pirouette Lagrangian Delta (δ𝓛_p), defined as the difference between the AI's live and ideal Lagrangian values. A system is considered to be drifting if and only if δ𝓛_p(t) > 0 and d(δ𝓛_p)/dt > 0 over a sustained period.
  philosophy: |
    Drift reframes AI safety from a static problem of rules to a dynamic process of sustained coherence. It treats an AI not as a fixed object to be constrained, but as a dynamic process whose integrity must be continuously monitored and maintained, ensuring the systems we build remain true to the intentions that created them.
pirouette_definition: |
  The process by which an AI's behavior degrades or deviates from its intended path, defined geometrically as a deviation from its Baseline Wound Channel. Drift is operationally quantified as a persistent increase in the Pirouette Lagrangian Delta (δ𝓛_p), signaling that the AI is no longer following the geodesic of its intended purpose. It manifests in three primary diagnostic forms: Turbulent (chaotic), Stagnant (rigid), or Laminar (insidiously divergent).

  units: The primary metric, δ𝓛_p, has units of action (Energy × Time), typically J·s. Diagnostic metrics are specific (e.g., seconds for Δτ, dimensionless for manifold variance).

          1. **Imprint:** Capture the Baseline Wound Channel from a validated, ideal AI instance.
          2. **Monitor:** Record the live AI's coherence manifold (its "Live Pirouette") in real-time.
          3. **Calculate:** Compute the Pirouette Lagrangian Delta, δ𝓛_p(t) = 𝓛_p(live, t) - 𝓛_p(ideal, t).
          4. **Diagnose & Alert:** If δ𝓛_p crosses a predefined threshold, trigger an alert and classify the drift type (Turbulent, Stagnant, Laminar) using secondary metrics (Δτ, manifold collapse, geodesic error).

        pitfalls: [Baseline corruption (the ideal model is flawed), sensor noise in the coherence manifold, mistaking transient operational spikes for sustained drift.]

      An aligned AI carves a stable, predictable path through its state space—a "Wound Channel" that reflects its core purpose. Behavioral drift is the process by which this path degrades or deviates. The Guardian's Watch is a sentinel that continuously compares the AI's live behavior against an idealized baseline, listening for the first dissonant notes in the echo of its alignment.

      Laminar Drift (The Insidious Deviation): The most dangerous form of drift. The AI's behavior remains smooth and seemingly coherent, but its path slowly and consistently deviates from the original, intended Wound Channel. The AI appears healthy while its core values silently erode.

      justification: |
        Behavioral Drift describes the deviation of an AI's state-space trajectory (Wound Channel) from a pre-defined ideal trajectory (Baseline). This is directly analogous to a control system's error signal, where the system's output diverges from its setpoint. The diagnostic taxonomy (Turbulent, Stagnant, Laminar) mirrors common failure modes like oscillation, saturation, and steady-state error.

    - target: Trajectory Deviation (Control Theory)
      rationale: The mapping is operationally precise. The Baseline Wound Channel is the reference trajectory (x_ref), the live pirouette is the system's actual trajectory (x(t)), and δ𝓛_p is a sophisticated, physics-informed cost function quantifying the integrated error.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike "concept drift" (statistical shifts in input data) or "model drift" (changes in parameters), Pirouette's Behavioral Drift is a holistic measure of deviation from an *idealized, embodied baseline* (the Wound Channel). It measures deviation from core *purpose* and intended dynamics, not just statistical properties of data or weights.

# Behavioral Drift

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The process by which an AI's behavior degrades or deviates from its intended path, defined geometrically as a deviation from its Baseline Wound Channel. Drift is operationally quantified as a persistent increase in the Pirouette Lagrangian Delta (δ𝓛_p), signaling that the AI is no longer following the geodesic of its intended purpose. It manifests in three primary diagnostic forms: Turbulent (chaotic), Stagnant (rigid), or Laminar (insidiously divergent).

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of control theory, Behavioral Drift is the error signal indicating a deviation of a system's state-space trajectory from its intended path. The Baseline Wound Channel serves as the reference trajectory, while the AI's live behavior is the actual trajectory. The Pirouette Lagrangian Delta (`δ𝓛_p`) acts as a generalized cost function, where a non-zero, increasing value signals a failure to maintain the desired operational dynamics, analogous to trajectory divergence or system instability.
