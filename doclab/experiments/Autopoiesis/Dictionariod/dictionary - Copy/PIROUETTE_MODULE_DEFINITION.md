  art: |
    A single, whole form that speaks the language of human intuition and machine logic with the same voice. It is the loom upon which a chaotic insight is woven into a coherent tapestry, giving knowledge a body.
  law: |
    A `.pmd` file MUST consist of a valid YAML front-matter block (the Blueprint) followed by a Markdown body (the Narrative). The Blueprint MUST contain at least an `id`, `title`, and `version`. The system fails this law if the Forge cannot parse these two components or generates artifacts (Codex/Signal) from only one.
  philosophy: |
    The `.pmd` format enforces the principle that structure and meaning are inseparable. By unifying the machine-readable blueprint and the human-readable narrative, it minimizes the entropic loss between an idea's conception and its propagation, ensuring that the form of knowledge directly serves its function.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Pirouette Module Definition (`.pmd`) is the autopoietic authoring format of the framework, unifying two inseparable aspects in a single source file. It consists of a **Blueprint**, a machine-readable YAML front-matter block that maps the module's identity and relationships within the framework's coherence manifold, and a **Narrative**, a human-readable Markdown body that expresses the module's resonant insight. The format is a practical instrument for applying the Pirouette Lagrangian to the act of creation, designed as a "loom" to guide the synthesis of high-coherence knowledge artifacts.

          1. Read the input `.pmd` file.
          2. Attempt to parse a single YAML document from the start of the file, delimited by `---`.
          3. Validate the parsed YAML against the framework schema (e.g., presence of `id`, `title`).
          4. Treat all subsequent content as a Markdown document.
          5. A valid `.pmd` must pass both YAML parsing/validation and be readable as Markdown.

      Every `.pmd` file is a single flow of coherence, expressed as two inseparable aspects. This structure is a discipline designed to maximize the clarity and power of the idea it embodies, mirroring the universal dynamic of a river flowing through a riverbed. The Blueprint (YAML Front-matter)... is the riverbed, the stable geometry that grounds the module... The Narrative (Markdown Body)... is the river of information itself.

    excerpt: |
      Once woven on the loom, a module enters the Forge. This is the automated process that performs an Alchemical Union, transforming the single source file into two distinct, higher-order manifestations without losing its singular identity. The Codex (PDF Output) is the module's stable, archival body... The Signal (JSON Output) is the module's dynamic, living echo.

      justification: |
        Donald Knuth's Literate Programming paradigm combines source code (machine-readable logic) and documentation (human-readable explanation) into a single, woven narrative. The `.pmd` format directly applies this philosophy to knowledge management, where the structured YAML Blueprint serves the role of "code" and the Markdown Narrative serves as the expository text.

      rationale: The philosophical alignment is exact: a single source file where machine-parsable structure and human-readable narrative are composed together as an act of explanation.

      falsifier: "A longitudinal study of module evolution shows that modules authored in a sidecar format exhibit equal or lower rates of semantic drift and require less human effort to keep the two parts synchronized over multiple versions."

    The `.pmd` format is not a static "template" but a dynamic "loom"â€”an instrument that guides the authoring process. The YAML front-matter is not "metadata" but a foundational "Blueprint" that is inseparable from the Narrative's meaning.

# Pirouette Module Definition

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Pirouette Module Definition (`.pmd`) is the autopoietic authoring format of the framework, unifying two inseparable aspects in a single source file. It consists of a **Blueprint**, a machine-readable YAML front-matter block that maps the module's identity and relationships within the framework's coherence manifold, and a **Narrative**, a human-readable Markdown body that expresses the module's resonant insight. The format is a practical instrument for applying the Pirouette Lagrangian to the act of creation, designed as a "loom" to guide the synthesis of high-coherence knowledge artifacts.

## CS-First Summary
The `.pmd` format is a direct implementation of the **Literate Programming** paradigm applied to knowledge management. Instead of weaving code and documentation, it weaves a structured data **Blueprint** (in YAML) with a prose **Narrative** (in Markdown). This single-source-of-truth approach ensures that the machine-readable logic and the human-readable explanation evolve together, maximizing coherence and minimizing semantic drift.
