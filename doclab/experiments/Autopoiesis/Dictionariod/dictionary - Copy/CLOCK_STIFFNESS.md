  art: |
    The universe hums with the energy it pays to keep its clocks in sync. Clock stiffness is the price of that harmony, the resistance of the temporal fabric to the dissonance of a single tick falling out of place.
  law: |
    Clock Stiffness (κ) is the scalar coefficient of the clock phase (θ) kinetic term, defining the Noether current `J^μ_θ = κ(∂^μθ - q A^μ)`. A higher κ implies a greater energy cost to create gradients in the local clock, suppressing phase fluctuations and increasing the mass of gapped θ-modes.
  philosophy: |
    Clock Stiffness grounds the concept of a shared 'now' in a physical parameter. It ensures that the temporal medium is not an arbitrary, floppy manifold but a coherent substrate whose dynamics give rise to conserved charges. It separates the cost of clock *variation* (κ) from the cost of clock *mismatch curvature* (connection stiffness, g⁻²).

  The scalar parameter κ that sets the energy scale of the clock phase (θ) dynamics. In the Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM) effective action, it appears as the prefactor for the kinetic term `(κ/2) g^μν (∂_μθ - q A_μ)(∂_νθ - q A_ν)`. It quantifies the temporal medium's resistance to local dephasing and is dimensionally a squared mass in natural units.

        outline: |
          The parameter κ sets the mass of the gapped `θ` mode on the CPM. Integrating out this mode produces a finite renormalization of the clock-synchronization charge `q → Z_θ^(1/2) q`, where the normalization factor `Z_θ` is a function of κ and the cutoff scale `ω_c`. By measuring the physical charge `e = (Z_θ^(1/2) q)g` and independently constraining the bare parameters `q` and `g` via other Pirouette processes (e.g., Γ-tail running), κ can be inferred.
        expected_signals: [A massive scalar mode coupling to the electromagnetic current near the coherence barrier `ω_c`, specific contribution to the running of α at high energies.]
        pitfalls: [Effects are suppressed at energies `μ ≪ ω_c`, making them difficult to distinguish from other new physics. The calculation of `Z_θ` may depend on non-perturbative dynamics.]

      justification: |
        The mathematical form `L ⊃ (κ/2) (∂_μθ)²` is the canonical kinetic term for a real scalar field θ. κ plays the role of a normalization constant that determines the "stiffness" against field fluctuations. This is directly analogous to superfluid density `ρ_s` in the effective theory of superfluids, which sets the energy cost of phase twists.

# Clock Stiffness

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The scalar parameter κ that sets the energy scale of the clock phase (θ) dynamics. In the Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM) effective action, it appears as the prefactor for the kinetic term `(κ/2) g^μν (∂_μθ - q A_μ)(∂_νθ - q A_ν)`. It quantifies the temporal medium's resistance to local dephasing and is dimensionally a squared mass in natural units.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of effective field theory, Clock Stiffness (κ) is the normalization coefficient for the kinetic term of the scalar clock phase field (θ). For a standard Lagrangian `L ⊃ (1/2) Z (∂_μθ)²`, κ is equivalent to `Z`. It determines the energy cost of gradients in the phase field, making it mathematically analogous to the superfluid density (`ρ_s`) in the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superfluids, which penalizes twists in the condensate's phase.
