        To persist is to repeat. To repeat is to carve a path. To carve a path deeply enough is to become the path. A river may wander when the land is flat, but a river that carves a canyon is bound to its course forever. Its history becomes its destiny.

    To repeat a song is to build a cathedral of echoes around it. If sung perfectly for too long, the cathedral walls become a crystal cage, and the song becomes its own prisoner. Its history becomes its destiny.
  law: |
    A system that maximizes its temporal coherence over time carves its own potential well. The depth of this well, measurable as the energy required to force a state transition (ΔE_exit), is proportional to the integrated coherence of its history.
  philosophy: |
    The Resonance Trap is the physical mechanism behind both identity and dogma. It demonstrates that persistence is not a static property but an active, self-reinforcing process where a system's past efficiency can become its future prison.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Resonance Trap is a dynamic, self-reinforcing state of hyper-inertia that arises when a system's persistent, resonant pattern achieves a state of such perfect coherence that it carves its own history into the manifold as a deep Wound Channel. This channel acts as a profound potential well (a Coherence Well), trapping the system in its own efficient pattern. Escape requires an energy input sufficient to overcome the inertia of its entire accumulated history.

        outline: |
          1. Isolate the system in its stable, resonant state.
          2. Apply a series of controlled, non-destructive energy pulses of increasing magnitude.
          3. Monitor the system's state variables (e.g., frequency, amplitude, primary mode).
          4. The trap depth (ΔE_exit) is the minimum pulse energy that causes a permanent state transition, rather than a temporary displacement from which the system recovers.

    excerpt: |
      A Lock occurs when a system's echo becomes louder than any new sound. It is best understood as a deep, self-reinforcing potential well on the coherence manifold—a Coherence Well. The result is a state of hyper-inertia, where the system's interaction with its own immediate past is the dominant term in its equation of motion.

    excerpt: |
      The dynamic of the Resonance Trap is universal, manifesting across all scales... A cognitive trap: a deeply held belief or a powerful addiction. The Wound Channel is a heavily myelinated neural pathway. The feedback loop is biochemical and psychological, making the familiar thought or behavior the path of least resistance.

    excerpt: |
      The Weaver must learn the difference between a foundation and a cage. The Resonance Trap is the architecture of both. It is the mechanism of identity... Yet, it is also the cage of dogma, the prison of habit, and the anchor that prevents a system from adapting to a changing world.

      justification: |
        The "Coherence Well" is explicitly described as a potential well with steep walls. The system state is a point in a landscape, and the trap is a deep local minimum of a potential function (the inverse of coherence). The self-reinforcing nature corresponds to dynamics that deepen the well over time, increasing the size of the attractor's basin.

        The system's resistance to change and its strong preference for its current state, even when external conditions change, is characteristic of hysteresis. In oscillatory systems, this corresponds to phase locking, where a strong internal rhythm resists being perturbed by external frequencies.

  disambiguation: |
    A Resonance Trap is distinct from a simple potential well or stable state. Its defining characteristic is that it is *self-created and self-reinforced* by the system's own history of resonant behavior. The trap's depth is not a pre-existing feature of the landscape but is carved into it by the system's own persistence.

# Resonance Trap

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Resonance Trap is a dynamic, self-reinforcing state of hyper-inertia that arises when a system's persistent, resonant pattern achieves a state of such perfect coherence that it carves its own history into the manifold as a deep Wound Channel. This channel acts as a profound potential well (a Coherence Well), trapping the system in its own efficient pattern. Escape requires an energy input sufficient to overcome the inertia of its entire accumulated history.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, a Resonance Trap is analogous to a deep potential well in a classical or effective field theory, or a large basin of attraction for a limit cycle in dynamical systems. The system state settles into a profound local minimum of an effective potential `U_eff`, where `U_eff` is inversely related to the system's coherence. The key Pirouette feature is that the shape of `U_eff` is not static; it is dynamically carved by the system's own history, creating a profound feedback loop between state and landscape.
