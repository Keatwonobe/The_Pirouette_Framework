  art: |
    A wound is a crucible. The Forge Cycle gathers the broken shards of a system, heats them with the fire of focused debate, and hammers them into the new, coherent form that was always waiting to be born.
  law: |
    The coherence profile of any solution-agent generated by a Forge Cycle is a direct and predictable geometric consequence of the pressures defined in the initial diagnosis. Form follows friction.
  philosophy: |
    True solutions are not imposed from without; they are birthed from within. The Forge Cycle is an act of 'coherence midwifery,' guiding a system to heal itself by creating the part it was missing.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Forge Cycle is the autopoietic, four-stage protocol (Diagnose, Convene, Synthesize, Embody) that systematically transforms a diagnosed Coherence Fracture into a durable, procedural solution. It begins by mapping the problem's dynamic signature, convenes a 'debate swarm' of Personas representing the core pressures, facilitates their Alchemical Union into a higher-order harmony, and codifies the result as an Action Engram—a formal blueprint that specifies both the corrective action and the coherence profile of the agent forged to execute it.

          Audit the artifacts produced at each stage. 1. Verify a formal diagnosis artifact (per `DYNA-003`) exists. 2. Verify a list of convened Personas that map to the diagnosis's core pressures. 3. Verify logs or records of the synthesis process (per `DYNA-002`). 4. Verify the output is a well-formed Action Engram with a valid hash and a direct lineage to the synthesis outcome.

      The Forge operates on a four-stage cycle, systematically transforming the incoherent pressure of a problem into the coherent form of a solution. 1. Diagnose (Mapping the Coherence Fracture)... 2. Convene (The Crucible of Personas)... 3. Synthesize (The Alchemical Weaving)... 4. Embody (Forging the Action Engram)...
  - module: DOMA-075
    excerpt: |
      The central law of the Forge is this: the soul of the solution is forged in the fire of the problem. A successful cycle produces two inseparable artifacts within a single Action Engram: An Action Blueprint and An Agent Coherence Profile. This creates a genealogy of solutions. The character of the solution-agent is a direct geometric consequence of the challenge it overcame.

      justification: |
        The Forge Cycle is a problem-solving loop analogous to the OODA loop. Diagnose maps to Observe/Orient; Convene/Synthesize maps to a structured form of Orient/Decide; Embody/Execution maps to Act. However, the Forge Cycle is generative (creating a new agent) rather than purely decision-oriented for an existing agent.

      justification: |
        The Convene stage explicitly sets up conflicting viewpoints (Personas) analogous to thesis and antithesis. The Synthesize stage is a direct implementation of achieving a higher-level synthesis that resolves the initial conflict, which is then codified (Embodied).

  adopted:
    - target: Hegelian Dialectic
      rationale: The mapping is strongest due to the explicit mechanisms of convening opposing Personas (thesis, antithesis) and the stated goal of Alchemical Union (synthesis) through structured debate, rather than simple decision-making.

# Forge Cycle

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Forge Cycle is the autopoietic, four-stage protocol (Diagnose, Convene, Synthesize, Embody) that systematically transforms a diagnosed Coherence Fracture into a durable, procedural solution. It begins by mapping the problem's dynamic signature, convenes a 'debate swarm' of Personas representing the core pressures, facilitates their Alchemical Union into a higher-order harmony, and codifies the result as an Action Engram—a formal blueprint that specifies both the corrective action and the coherence profile of the agent forged to execute it.

## EFT-First Summary
The Forge Cycle is a structured, recursive protocol for problem resolution, conceptually mapped to a Hegelian Dialectic. It formally convenes conflicting viewpoints (thesis, antithesis) as 'Personas' and drives them through a constrained debate process to find a higher-order resolution (synthesis), which is then codified as an operational plan. This process is deterministic in that the properties of the solution are a direct function of the initial conflict's structure.
