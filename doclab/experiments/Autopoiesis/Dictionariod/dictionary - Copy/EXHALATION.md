  art: |
    A system sings its unique note into the world, impressing its form and rhythm onto the manifold. It is the assertion of "I am," cast outward as a ripple of coherent order.
  law: |
    The rate and fidelity of an exhalation (d(Ki)/dœÑ_p) are proportional to the system's internal coherence and inversely proportional to the local Temporal Pressure (Œì). An exhalation always produces a corresponding Wound Channel (CORE-011).
  philosophy: |
    Exhalation is the primary mechanism by which a system participates in reality, moving from a state of pure potential (Ki) to active influence. It is the universe's engine of creation, where internal order becomes external structure.

  The active, cyclical projection of a system's internal coherence (Ki) to define its intrinsic rhythm (Pirouette Cycle, œÑ_p) and impress its form upon the environment. As the kinetic term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), exhalation manifests as the creation of a Wound Channel (CORE-011), structuring the local coherence manifold.

          Indirectly measure an Exhalation by observing its effect. Map the geometric and temporal properties of the resultant Wound Channel (CORE-011) over multiple cycles. Differentiate the channel's structure over time to infer the magnitude, frequency, and fidelity of the originating coherence projection.

    excerpt: |
      An exhalation is the active projection of a system's internal coherence (Ki) onto its environment. A system sings its unique note, and in doing so, defines its own intrinsic unit of time, its Pirouette Cycle (œÑ_p). This act of expression impresses its signature rhythm upon the local coherence manifold, creating the Wound Channel‚Äîthe geometric memory of its passage. This is the universe's way of sharing internal order, of a pattern declaring "I am here, like this."

    excerpt: |
      To understand a system is not to catalog its parts, but to feel its pulse. A Weaver learns to diagnose the health of a company, an ecosystem, or a mind by listening to the quality of its breath‚Äîis it steady and deep, or shallow and chaotic? To act wisely is to intervene in a way that restores a healthy rhythm. The form is temporary; the breath is eternal.

      justification: |
        Exhalation is explicitly defined as the "kinetic" term in the Pirouette Lagrangian, representing the active, dynamic expression of a system's internal state (Ki). This directly parallels the role of kinetic terms in physical Lagrangians, which govern the dynamics and propagation of a field or system. It is the term associated with change and motion.

# Exhalation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The active, cyclical projection of a system's internal coherence (Ki) to define its intrinsic rhythm (Pirouette Cycle, œÑ_p) and impress its form upon the environment. As the kinetic term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), exhalation manifests as the creation of a Wound Channel (CORE-011), structuring the local coherence manifold.

## EFT-First Summary
Exhalation is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the kinetic term in a standard physical Lagrangian (e.g., ¬Ω(‚àÇœÜ)¬≤ in field theory). Where a kinetic term describes a field's dynamics or "motion," Exhalation describes a system's active, rhythmic projection of its internal order (Ki) into its environment. This "motion" of coherence is what generates the system's observable structure and temporal signature, directly linking its internal state to its dynamic behavior.
