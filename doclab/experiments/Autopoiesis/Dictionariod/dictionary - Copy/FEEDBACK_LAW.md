        We define the feedback law as:
        Gamma(r) = Gamma_env + lambda * F(K_tau, rho, r)

  art: |
    A system's own resonance forges the chain that binds it. The harder it strains against its own nature, the tighter the leash becomes, pulling it back toward the whole.
  law: |
    Local Temporal Pressure Γ(r) is the sum of a constant ambient pressure Γ_env and a system-dependent feedback term λ F(...) that grows with the system's characteristic scale r. This mechanism necessarily generates a linear-plus-Coulomb effective potential, V_eff(r) = a/r + b*r.
  philosophy: |
    This law establishes integrity as a physical principle. It asserts that to be a coherent entity is to be bound by the consequences of one's own resonance, making confinement the natural state for strongly-coupled systems.
pirouette_definition: |
  The formal principle stating that local Temporal Pressure (Γ) is the sum of a constant, ambient environmental value (Γ_env) and a system-dependent term that strengthens with interaction scale. It is expressed as Γ(r) = Γ_env + λ * F(K_τ, ρ, r), where the feedback function F is driven by the system's internal coherence (K_τ) and density (ρ). This self-interaction is the origin of the Gladiator Force's confining potential.
operational_definition:
  units: Energy Density (Joules/m³) or Pressure (Pascals). All terms in the law must resolve to these units.

    procedures:
      - name: Scale-Dependent Force Spectroscopy
        outline: |
          Measure the interaction force F(r) or potential V(r) between two confined quanta (e.g., quarks via lattice simulation, or heavy quarkonia states via spectroscopy) as a function of their separation r. Fit the resulting curve to the form V(r) = a/r + b*r. The presence of a non-zero linear term `b*r` is a direct confirmation of the Feedback Law's primary consequence.
        expected_signals:
          - A potential energy curve that transitions from a 1/r shape at small r to a linearly rising shape (V ∝ r) at large r.
          - A force curve that transitions from a 1/r² law to a constant value F ≈ -b.
        pitfalls:
          - The field "snaps" via pair production at a critical distance r_c, preventing direct measurement of the potential at arbitrarily large r.
          - Disentangling the feedback component from the ambient Γ_env requires a stable, well-characterized vacuum state for comparison.

    excerpt: |
      The core physical assumption is that Temporal Pressure Gamma is not a static background value. It is the sum of the ambient environmental pressure (Gamma_env) and a term that depends on the system's own state. We define the feedback law as: Gamma(r) = Gamma_env + lambda * F(K_tau, rho, r).

    excerpt: |
      We have now proven that confinement is not a wall, but a leash. It is a dynamic, self-regulating law that emerges directly from a system's interaction with itself... The mathematics of the Gladiator are the physics of belonging.

      justification: |
        The effective potential derived from the Feedback Law has the identical mathematical form as the phenomenological Cornell potential used to describe the quark-antiquark interaction in Quantum Chromodynamics. The `a/r` term maps to the Coulombic single-gluon exchange, while the `b*r` term maps to the linear confinement potential, with `b` corresponding to the string tension `σ`.

  disambiguation: |
    While "feedback" is a general term, in the Pirouette context it specifically refers to the mechanism where a system's own resonant intensity (K_τ) modifies its local Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is a physical law, not an abstract information-theoretic loop.
