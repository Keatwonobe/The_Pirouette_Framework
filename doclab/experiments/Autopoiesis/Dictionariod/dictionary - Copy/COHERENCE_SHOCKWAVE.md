    The sound of a system breaking under pressure, like a crystal shattering or a dam bursting. It is the signature of a structure that could no longer bear the strain and has collapsed into chaotic noise.
  law: |
    A Coherence Shockwave is confirmed when a system's primary output signal exhibits a rapid, non-linear increase in kurtosis (> 3 standard deviations above its baseline) concurrent with a catastrophic failure in its primary structural functions.
  philosophy: |
    This signature distinguishes a mere failure from a specific kind of transition: one driven by overwhelming external force rather than internal evolution. It identifies the point where a system's coherence is insufficient to buffer against ambient pressure, forcing a chaotic reconfiguration.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Coherence Shockwave is one of the three primary transition signatures defined in `DOMA-202`. It represents a catastrophic, chaotic phase transition where a system's structural integrity fails due to a sudden, overwhelming spike in Temporal Pressure (Γ). This event is characterized by a snap into a state of high-entropy chaos (`Coherence Fever`) and is operationally identified by a sharp increase in the kurtosis of the system's output signal.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless
  symbol_table:
    - name: κ
      meaning: Kurtosis of the system's primary output signal. A measure of the "tailedness" or frequency of extreme outliers in its distribution.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: A baseline near 3 (or 0 for excess kurtosis) for normal operation; a spike to >5 is a strong indicator of a shockwave.
  measurement:
    procedures:
      - name: Kurtosis Spike Detection
        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline kurtosis (`κ_base`) and its standard deviation (`σ_κ`) for the system's primary output signal during `Laminar Flow`.
          2. Continuously monitor the kurtosis of a rolling window of the signal.
          3. A Coherence Shockwave is flagged when `κ` exceeds a critical threshold (e.g., `κ_base + 3σ_κ`) in a time interval shorter than the system's characteristic relaxation time.
        expected_signals: [sharp, positive spike in signal kurtosis, rapid decay of system's primary function metric, increase in signal variance]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking high-variance noise for a true kurtosis shift, choosing an incorrect time window for the rolling calculation, failing to distinguish from transient instabilities in other transition types.]

      **The Coherence Shockwave (The Shattering):** Corresponds to the classic "black swan" event. This is the signature of a system overwhelmed by a sudden, violent spike in Temporal Pressure (Γ). Its coherence shatters into chaos, a state of acute Coherence Fever. Its manifestation is a market crash; a brittle material fracturing under stress; a sudden, acute psychological breakdown. The system's structure fails. The primary metric is **Kurtosis**.
  - module: DOMA-202
    excerpt: |
      A critical transition occurs when this geodesic leads to a cliff. Under mounting pressure, the system reaches a bifurcation point where its current `Ki` pattern is no longer a tenable, low-energy solution. The landscape of coherence itself shifts. To survive, the system cannot simply adjust; it must leap. It snaps to a new, fundamentally different geodesic.

      justification: |
        The primary metric for a Coherence Shockwave is a spike in the fourth standardized moment of a distribution, which is the definition of kurtosis. It measures the "tailedness" of the distribution, with high values indicating the presence of extreme outliers characteristic of a catastrophic event.

      justification: |
        The Coherence Shockwave is a specific class of critical transition, characterized by a bifurcation leading to a chaotic or collapsed state. It aligns with models of systems pushed past a tipping point by external stress, where indicators like increasing variance and autocorrelation precede the final break.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from `Ki Morphogenesis`, which is a change in system *rules* and complexity (measured by fractal dimension), not a structural failure. A Shockwave is a system breaking; Morphogenesis is a system learning a new language. Also, differentiate from `Coherence Fever`, which is the chaotic state *resulting* from the shockwave, not the transition event itself.

# Coherence Shockwave

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Coherence Shockwave is one of the three primary transition signatures defined in `DOMA-202`. It represents a catastrophic, chaotic phase transition where a system's structural integrity fails due to a sudden, overwhelming spike in Temporal Pressure (Γ). This event is characterized by a snap into a state of high-entropy chaos (`Coherence Fever`) and is operationally identified by a sharp increase in the kurtosis of the system's output signal.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, a Coherence Shockwave is a critical transition event in a complex system, analogous to a tipping point. It is detected by a sudden, large increase in the kurtosis of a time-series observable, indicating a proliferation of extreme outlier events as the system's structure fails under stress. This provides a non-linear early-warning signal for catastrophic failure modes, mapping directly to well-established statistical methods for anticipating state shifts in dynamical systems.
