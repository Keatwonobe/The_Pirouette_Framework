        If the post-collapse environment is similar to the old one and the system's Wound Channel is deep and clear, the path of least resistance is to return to the original song. The Wound Channel acts as a powerful geometric attractor, and the system "snaps back" into its old Ki pattern, re-carving the familiar riverbed.

triad:
  art: |
    The resilience of a bent branch straightening. The system returns to the song it always knew, the scar of its collapse now a quiet memory reinforcing the original melody. The river reclaims its familiar, well-worn bed.
  law: |
    Following a coherence-collapse event, if a system's pre-collapse resonant pattern (Ki_0) represents a local maximum on the new coherence manifold, the system will re-converge to Ki_0. The fidelity of return is measurable as the delta between the final state (Ki_f) and the initial state (Ki_0), which must approach zero for the recovery to be classified as restorative.
  philosophy: |
    This recovery type demonstrates that resilience is not always transformation, but can be an act of profound stability and the power of an established identity to re-assert itself. It affirms that a system's core pattern can be an anchor strong enough to pull it back from chaos, provided the world still has a place for that pattern.
pirouette_definition: |
  A recovery outcome following a systemic collapse where the system's internal resonant pattern (Ki) returns to its pre-collapse state (Ki_0). This occurs when the post-collapse environmental conditions and the geometry of the Wound Channel favor the original pattern as the most coherent, stable state available. Restorative Recovery is characterized by the Wound Channel acting as a strong geometric attractor, guiding the system back to its familiar equilibrium.

        outline: |
          1. Characterize the system's stable resonant pattern (Ki_0) during Laminar Flow.
          2. Induce a collapse event, triggering Turbulent Flow.
          3. Monitor the system's state variables through the Latency, Acceleration, and Stabilization phases.
          4. Characterize the final, stable resonant pattern (Ki_f) after stabilization.
          5. Calculate a normalized distance metric `d(Ki_0, Ki_f)`. Restorative Recovery is confirmed if `d` is below a pre-defined threshold (e.g., < 0.05).

    excerpt: |
      The choice between Restorative, Adaptive, and Transformative paths is not a choice at all; it is the inevitable outcome of the system following its new geodesic toward a new peak on the coherence manifold. Resilience, therefore, is not a measure of a system's ability to resist change, but a measure of its efficiency in finding its new path of maximal coherence after a disruption.

      justification: |
        Restorative Recovery describes a system returning to its original state space attractor (Ki_0) after being perturbed into a chaotic regime. The conditions for this recovery—a deep Wound Channel and a permissive environment—are analogous to the system state remaining within the basin of attraction of its original fixed point, making its return the path of least action.

  claims:
    - statement: "A system can only undergo Restorative Recovery if its original resonant pattern, Ki_0, remains a local minimum in the potential energy landscape (a maximum on the coherence manifold) after the collapse event."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "Observing a system return to Ki_0 even when an alternative, more coherent state (Ki_new) is demonstrably available and accessible. This would imply a non-Lagrangian, memory-dominant recovery mechanism not captured by the current model."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from *Adaptive Recovery*, where the system settles into a *new* state near the original, and *Transformative Recovery*, where the system becomes a fundamentally different entity. Restorative Recovery is exclusively about returning to the original functional and structural pattern with high fidelity.
