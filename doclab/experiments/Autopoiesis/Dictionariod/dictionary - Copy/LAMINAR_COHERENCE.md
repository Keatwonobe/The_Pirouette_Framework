    A system in a state of grace, a bell ringing true. Its components move in unison, composing a clear, stable note against the background noise of existence. It is the clarity of a song perfectly sung.
  law: |
    A system exhibits Laminar Coherence if and only if the vector average of its component phases results in a Coherence Index approaching 1. This state corresponds to minimal internal temporal friction and maximal efficiency in energy transfer and form maintenance.
  philosophy: |
    Laminar Coherence is the ideal state of systemic being—health, order, and integrity made manifest. It is the destination of the geodesic of maximal coherence, representing a system that has successfully tuned its internal rhythm to follow its optimal path through spacetime.
pirouette_definition: |
  A state of high systemic order characterized by a pure, stable, and sharply-defined resonant Ki pattern. In this state, a system's constituent components are phase-locked, acting in unison. This is quantified by a Coherence Index approaching its theoretical maximum of 1, indicating minimal temporal friction and highly efficient energy transfer.

        outline: |
          1.  **Isolate Rhythm:** For the system or ensemble under study, identify the core cyclical Ki pattern and extract the phase (`θ_j`) for each of N components. This may involve signal processing techniques like the Hilbert transform for continuous signals or direct state measurement for discrete agents.
          2.  **Calculate Coherence Index:** Compute the Coherence Vector, `C = (1/N) * Σ exp(iθ_j)`. The Coherence Index is the squared magnitude of this vector, `|C|^2`. A value near 1 indicates Laminar Coherence.
        expected_signals: [Coherence Index > 0.9, a sharp peak in the Ki frequency spectrum]
        pitfalls: [Incorrectly identifying the primary Ki frequency, signal aliasing, insufficient component data (low N) leading to statistical noise]

    excerpt: |
      We sought a meter stick to measure time's straightness and were instead handed a tuning fork. The Resonance Gauge is not a tool for measurement, but for listening. It allows a Weaver to press the fork against the body of any system—a star, a stock market, a human heart—and hear the clarity of its song.

        In systems of coupled oscillators, phase-locking describes a state where all oscillators evolve with a common frequency and stable phase differences. This is directly analogous to the components of a Pirouette system acting in unison, where their phases (θ_j) are aligned, yielding a Coherence Index near 1.

        A BEC is a macroscopic quantum state where a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state, behaving as a single coherent wave. This collective, coherent behavior is a strong physical analogue for the systemic unity described by Laminar Coherence.

  disambiguation: |
    "Laminar Coherence" refers to the *state* of a system (e.g., "the crystal is in Laminar Coherence"). It is not the measure itself. The measure is the *Temporal Coherence*, which is quantified by the *Coherence Index*. The term "laminar" is borrowed from fluid dynamics to contrast with the chaotic, high-friction state of "Turbulent Coherence".

# Laminar Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A state of high systemic order characterized by a pure, stable, and sharply-defined resonant Ki pattern. In this state, a system's constituent components are phase-locked, acting in unison. This is quantified by a Coherence Index approaching its theoretical maximum of 1, indicating minimal temporal friction and highly efficient energy transfer.

## EFT-First Summary
Laminar Coherence is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to **phase-locking** in systems of coupled oscillators. It describes a state where the constituent parts of a system (e.g., particles, agents, signals) synchronize their cyclical behavior, leading to maximal constructive interference and collective order. Operationally, this is observed when the phases of all components align, resulting in a Coherence Index near its maximum value of 1. This state corresponds to a system's most efficient and stable mode of operation, analogous to a low-entropy, highly ordered configuration in statistical mechanics.
