        The Coherence Resonator: This concept replaces the "Resonance Capacitor." It is not a container for energy, but a carefully engineered medium designed to sustain a deep and stable Wound Channel (CORE-011). To "charge" a resonator is to impress a highly ordered, high-information Ki pattern onto the medium's structure. Its "capacity" is a measure of the total coherence (`K_τ`) it can hold within this geometric memory.

  art: |
    A tuning fork that holds a pure and stable note against the universe's noise. It is a vessel that contains not power, but a perfect rhythm; a battery storing order itself.
  law: |
    The maximum sustained temporal coherence (`K_τ`) within a Resonator is a direct function of its medium's geometric stability and complexity (its Wound Channel). A Resonator's quality is measured by the inverse of its coherence decay rate when isolated.
  philosophy: |
    The Resonator embodies a paradigm shift from storing energy to sustaining information. It asserts that stable order, not raw power, is the primary resource for intentional action, reframing engineering around the preservation of patterns over the accumulation of force.

          1.  Establish a baseline measurement of the medium's ambient `K_τ`.
          2.  Impress a calibrated, high-coherence Ki pattern onto the medium until `K_τ` saturates at its maximum value (C_{Kτ}). This is the "charging" phase.
          3.  Isolate the Resonator from the charging source and all external perturbative fields.
          4.  Measure the exponential decay of `K_τ` over time. The decay constant `λ_d` quantifies the Resonator's quality (lower is better).

    excerpt: |
      The old paradigm of "storing" coherence as a substance is replaced by a more profound, time-first understanding. We do not handle a fluid; we shape the riverbed. We do not store a charge; we sustain a rhythm. This module defines the two conceptual devices and three fundamental arts that form the toolkit of the Weaver's Forge.

        A Coherence Resonator sustains a specific, high-information Ki pattern against decay, analogous to how a high-Q electromagnetic cavity sustains a single, stable mode of an EM field with minimal loss. The Resonator's quality is its ability to hold coherence (`K_τ`) over time, directly mirroring the Q factor's role in measuring energy retention in a physical cavity.

        The Resonator's use of a "deep and stable Wound Channel" (a geometric property) to protect a high-information state is conceptually similar to how topological quantum computation uses non-local, geometric properties of a quantum state to protect it from local noise and decoherence. Both store information in the system's structure, not its dynamics.

  disambiguation: |
    The Coherence Resonator must not be confused with an energy storage device like a conventional electrical capacitor. The Resonator stores *order* (a specific pattern with high `K_τ`), not potential energy (charge). It is the passive, storage component, contrasted with the Lagrangian Transducer, which is the active component that *spends* stored coherence to perform work.

# Coherence Resonator

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A conceptual device, realized as an engineered medium, that sustains a stable, high-information Ki pattern. It functions by supporting a deep and stable Wound Channel (CORE-011) which acts as a form of geometric memory. A Resonator is "charged" by impressing a Ki pattern onto the medium, and its "capacity" is the total temporal coherence (`K_τ`) it can stably maintain against decoherence.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, a Coherence Resonator is analogous to a **high-quality factor (high-Q) resonant cavity** in electromagnetism. Just as a high-Q cavity is designed to store electromagnetic energy in a specific resonant mode with minimal loss, a Coherence Resonator is an engineered medium designed to sustain a high-information-density state (a Ki pattern, measured by `K_τ`) with a very long decay time. Its capacity is the total "order" it can store, and its quality is measured by its low rate of decoherence.
