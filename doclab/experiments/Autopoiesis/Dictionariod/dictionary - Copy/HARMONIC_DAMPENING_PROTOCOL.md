  art: |
    To pull a thread is to risk a snag. This is the skill of un-weaving a mistake before it tears the tapestry, calming the shudder of a dissonant chord back into silence.
  law: |
    Upon detection of a Dissonance Echo cascade (`DE ≥ DE_critical`) or manual command, the Protocol must be triggered to return the system to its pre-intervention baseline state or an alternate designated safe-harbor state. Its primary success metric is the reduction of DE below a safe threshold (`<2 RU`) within a pre-specified time (`T_rec`).
  philosophy: |
    The right to intervene confers the responsibility to retreat. This protocol is the embodiment of humility, a pre-planned admission that foresight is finite and that the first duty of the Weaver is to do no irreversible harm.
pirouette_definition: |
  A pre-configured, automated, and manually-triggered safety procedure designed to reverse a failing or destabilizing intervention (a Daedalus Gambit). It actively quells Dissonance Echoes and guides the target system back to its original baseline state, preserving Manifold Integrity. It is the final and most critical guardrail in the Universal Intervention Pipeline.
operational_definition:
  units: The protocol's efficacy is measured by the rate of change of system metrics, e.g., Resonance Units per cycle (RU/cycle) or % Laminar Flow Index per cycle (%/cycle).

        outline: |
          1.  Initiate Harmonic Dampening Protocol upon a trigger event (automated or manual).
          2.  Continuously monitor key system metrics via the Flow Dynamics Lens (DYNA-001).
          3.  Measure the exponential decay rate of the Dissonance Echo (DE).
          4.  Measure the recovery trajectory of the Laminar Flow Index (LFI).
          5.  Record the total time (`T_rec`) required for DE to fall below 2 RU and LFI to rise above 80%.
          6.  Confirm the system state has returned to the pre-intervention baseline logged in the Wound Channel Ledger (CORE-011).
        expected_signals: [Exponential decay of DE, Sigmoidal recovery of LFI]
        pitfalls: [Protocol introduces new, unforeseen resonances; System stabilizes in a new, non-baseline state; Recovery time exceeds maximum allowable T_rec.]

      justification: |
        The protocol functions as an active, dynamically-applied damping force. While a Gambit may drive a system's oscillator, unintended resonances (Dissonance Echoes) can arise. The protocol increases the dissipation term `γ` to rapidly quell these oscillations and remove energy from unwanted modes, allowing the system to return to a stable equilibrium.

    Do not confuse with the 'Tuning Fork' gambit. A Tuning Fork *introduces* a gentle, coherent harmonic to entrain a system out of chaos. The Harmonic Dampening Protocol *removes* or *quells* an unwanted, incoherent harmonic (dissonance) to return a system to baseline. One adds a signal, the other subtracts noise.

# Harmonic Dampening Protocol

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A pre-configured, automated, and manually-triggered safety procedure designed to reverse a failing or destabilizing intervention (a Daedalus Gambit). It actively quells Dissonance Echoes and guides the target system back to its original baseline state, preserving Manifold Integrity. It is the final and most critical guardrail in the Universal Intervention Pipeline.

## EFT-First Summary
This term does not have a direct mathematical equivalent in EFT but is conceptually mapped to the idea of an **active damping term** in a system's dynamics. When an intervention (`F_gambit(t)`) generates unstable field oscillations (Dissonance Echoes), this protocol is a procedure that rapidly and temporarily increases the system's dissipation coefficient (`γ`). This removes energy from the unstable modes, causing the oscillations to decay exponentially and allowing the system to return to a stable vacuum or ground state.
