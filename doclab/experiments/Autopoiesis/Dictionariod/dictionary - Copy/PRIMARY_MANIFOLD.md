    The unread map of a system's soul, where every potential path and hidden valley exists at once. It is the symphony before the conductor has singled out the soloist.

    The Primary Manifold $M_0$ is the total information content of a system prior to any coherence extraction. All subsequent Echo Manifolds $M_{k>0}$ are strict informational subsets of $M_0$.
  philosophy: |
    To name the starting point is to acknowledge that all analysis is an act of reduction. $M_0$ stands as a reminder of the system's initial wholeness, a benchmark against which the analyst's chosen narrative—the extracted sequence of resonances—must be measured.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Primary Manifold, $M_0$, is the complete, initial, and unpartitioned representation of a system's coherence landscape. It contains the superposition of all interacting resonances, from the dominant signal to the faintest echoes, and serves as the definitive starting point for any layered coherence analysis, such as the Archaeologist's Sieve protocol.

          1. Collect all relevant time-series data streams from the system under observation.
          2. Define a set of state variables that span the system's primary degrees of freedom.
          3. Construct a state-space representation where each point corresponds to a system state and directed edges between points represent observed transitions.
          4. The resulting geometric object, containing the complete topology of all observed dynamics, is the Primary Manifold $M_0$.

    excerpt: |
      The core insight is to treat every layer of a system's data as a complete coherence manifold, governed by the same universal principles. The "noise" from one layer becomes the "world" for the next... The Primary Manifold ($M_0$) [is] the complete, initial representation of the system's coherence landscape, containing all interacting resonances.
  - module: DOMA-176
    excerpt: |
      The excavation process begins with initialization: Define the Primary Manifold $M_{current} = M_0$. The first identified resonance, $Ki_1$, is the most significant contributor to maximizing the system's "action" ($S_p$), equivalent to finding the geodesic on the Primary Manifold.

      justification: |
        The phase space of a classical system contains all possible states (positions and momenta), representing its complete dynamical potential. $M_0$ is similarly the complete, initial representation of a system's coherence dynamics before any specific trajectory (resonance) is isolated.

      justification: |
        The initial state vector in quantum mechanics contains a superposition of all possible measurement outcomes. This is analogous to how $M_0$ contains a superposition of all discoverable resonances before analysis "selects" one.

    - target: System Phase Space
      rationale: |
        The analogy is direct and operational. The Primary Manifold represents the total observed state space of the system's coherence, just as a phase space represents the total state space of a classical system's dynamics. The Archaeologist's Sieve then acts as a method for identifying dominant attractors or periodic orbits within this space.

      falsifier: "If two different analysis teams, using valid but different Coherence Filter Sequences on the same $M_0$, produce irreconcilable Harmonic Spectra, it would imply that $M_0$ is not a complete representation but is instead dependent on the analytical path chosen."

  disambiguation: |
    $M_0$ must not be confused with an Echo Manifold ($M_k$ for $k>0$). The Primary Manifold is unique and contains all subsequent manifolds; Echo Manifolds are derived residues created by subtracting dominant resonances from the previous manifold.

# Primary Manifold

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Primary Manifold, $M_0$, is the complete, initial, and unpartitioned representation of a system's coherence landscape. It contains the superposition of all interacting resonances, from the dominant signal to the faintest echoes, and serves as the definitive starting point for any layered coherence analysis, such as the Archaeologist's Sieve protocol.

## EFT-First Summary
The Primary Manifold ($M_0$) is conceptually equivalent to the complete phase space of a classical dynamical system. It represents the total set of observed states and transitions, serving as the foundational object upon which analysis is performed. The extraction of dominant resonances via the Archaeologist's Sieve protocol is analogous to identifying major attractors or periodic orbits within this phase space.
