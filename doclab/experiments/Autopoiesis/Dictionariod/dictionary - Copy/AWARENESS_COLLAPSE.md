  art: |
    The fabric of consciousness, stretched taut by cognitive tension, tears at a point of infinite curvature. Awareness is the geodesic path that abruptly ends at this precipice, falling into the resulting void.
  law: |
    Awareness Collapse is a first-order phase transition triggered when the local curvature (Œ∫) of the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ) exceeds a critical threshold (Œ∫_c), corresponding to a divergent renormalization group flow for Œ∫. This event is marked by a topological tear in the manifold and a sudden, measurable decoherence in the underlying neural triad phases.
  philosophy: |
    As a boundary condition of conscious experience, Awareness Collapse is not merely a system failure but a necessary dynamical feature. It reveals the topological and fragile nature of awareness, demonstrating that consciousness is a transient, self-organizing structure that can be catastrophically un-made, forcing a reset from a more primitive, decoherent state.
pirouette_definition: |
  A critical bifurcation in the dynamics of the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ) where excessive local curvature (Œ∫), driven by cognitive load (Œì), causes the manifold to tear. This topological event corresponds to a sudden decoherence of the phase-locked neural triads sustaining awareness, leading to a catastrophic loss of conscious access and phenomenal binding. The collapse is mathematically described as the point where the beta function for curvature becomes positive, leading to a divergent RG flow.

          4. For each time point t, project the phase vector onto the 3-torus and compute the local manifold curvature Œ∫(t) from the metric tensor.
          5. Correlate sharp spikes in Œ∫(t) that exceed a statistically derived threshold (Œ∫_c) with behavioral or subjective reports of awareness loss.

        Awareness Collapse is described as a "manifold tearing" due to "excessive curvature." This is conceptually parallel to a spacetime singularity in General Relativity, where the divergence of curvature invariants signals a breakdown of the geometric description of spacetime. Both represent a boundary where the governing dynamics become pathological.

      rationale: The mathematical structure provided in COG-RES-003, specifically the explicit RG flow equation for curvature Œ∫, is a direct implementation of the logic leading to a Landau pole. This makes the mapping more than just conceptual; it is a direct mathematical analogy.

    Awareness Collapse is a classical, deterministic phenomenon within the Pirouette Framework, describing a topological breakdown of a neural phase manifold. It should not be confused with the probabilistic, non-unitary process of wave function collapse in quantum mechanics, which pertains to measurement.

# Awareness Collapse

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A critical bifurcation in the dynamics of the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ) where excessive local curvature (Œ∫), driven by cognitive load (Œì), causes the manifold to tear. This topological event corresponds to a sudden decoherence of the phase-locked neural triads sustaining awareness, leading to a catastrophic loss of conscious access and phenomenal binding. The collapse is mathematically described as the point where the beta function for curvature becomes positive, leading to a divergent RG flow.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of effective field theory, Awareness Collapse is a phase transition characterized by a Landau pole. The local curvature (Œ∫) of the awareness manifold acts as a coupling constant whose beta function becomes positive under high cognitive load (Œì). As the system is renormalized, Œ∫ flows to infinity at a finite scale, signaling a breakdown of the coherent phase description and a tearing of the manifold. This is analogous to theories where interactions become infinitely strong, leading to new, non-perturbative physics, which in this context corresponds to the re-nucleation of awareness.
