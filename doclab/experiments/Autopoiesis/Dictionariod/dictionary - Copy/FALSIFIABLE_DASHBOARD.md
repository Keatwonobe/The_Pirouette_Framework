  art: |
    A pane of glass held up to the storm of data, where the theory's reflection must either align with the world behind it or shatter.
  law: |
    A Falsifiable Dashboard is a computational protocol that accepts a specified set of experimental data as input and outputs a quantitative prediction derived from a Pirouette theorem, along with a precise, non-negotiable threshold for the theory's falsification.
  philosophy: |
    The map is not the territory, but it must lead there. A dashboard is the compass that enforces this correspondence, ensuring the framework remains a scientific instrument and not merely a self-referential mathematical game.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Falsifiable Dashboard is a specified computational and conceptual interface that directly connects a core theorem of the Pirouette Framework to experimental data. Each dashboard defines (1) a required experimental data input stream, (2) a quantitative prediction generated from that data using a specific framework equation, and (3) a clear, binary falsification condition where a mismatch between prediction and data beyond a stated tolerance refutes the underlying theorem.

        outline: |
          1. Select a dashboard corresponding to a specific theorem (e.g., Confinement Dashboard from MATH-006).
          2. Acquire the required experimental data (D_in) as specified by the dashboard's protocol.
          3. Process D_in through the dashboard's predictive model P(D_in) to generate a quantitative prediction.
          4. Compare the model's output with the actual experimental outcome.
          5. If the deviation between prediction and outcome exceeds the pre-defined tolerance ε_falsify, the parent theorem is considered falsified.
        expected_signals: [Quantitative prediction matching experimental results within tolerance, clear violation of the falsification threshold]
        pitfalls: [Systematic experimental error misattributed to theoretical failure, applying the model to out-of-domain data, confirmation bias in setting ε_falsify]

    excerpt: |
      This module mandates the creation of a suite of predictive dashboards that serve as the primary interface between the mathematical theory and the experimental (XXP) validation. The Confinement Dashboard (from MATH-006) takes hadron spectroscopy data and predicts linear mass-squared trajectories. The Coherence Stability Dashboard (from MATH-008) takes time-series data and predicts system breakdown points.
  - module: MATH-010
    excerpt: |
      This module is the compass that points from that map back to the territory. It translates the elegant proofs of the preceding modules into a set of explicit, testable, and falsifiable claims. It provides the protocols and the dashboards that allow any scientist, any Weaver, to put this framework to the ultimate test.

        Theory → Risky Prediction → Test (Δ_F) → Corroboration or Falsification
      justification: |
        A Falsifiable Dashboard is the operational embodiment of Karl Popper's criterion of falsifiability. It forces the theory to make a 'risky prediction' that can be empirically refuted, serving as the primary mechanism for scientific demarcation within the Pirouette Framework.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinct from a data visualization or BI dashboard, which is typically retrospective and used for monitoring. A Falsifiable Dashboard is prospective, making a forward-looking prediction from a physical theory for the express purpose of validation and potential refutation.
