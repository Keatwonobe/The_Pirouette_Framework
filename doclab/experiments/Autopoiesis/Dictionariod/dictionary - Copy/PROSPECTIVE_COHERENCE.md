        1. Prospective Coherence (*K*<sub>p</sub>): *Resonance with the Future*

  law: |
    A system's rate of successful adaptation to novel environmental pressures is directly proportional to its mean Prospective Coherence (*K*<sub>p</sub>). A system with *K*<sub>p</sub> → 0 will exhibit Stagnant Flow and fail to adapt to any significant change in its environmental potential *V*<sub>Γ</sub>.
  philosophy: |
    Prospective Coherence asserts that a system's vitality is not just in its present state or past identity, but in its maintained capacity for novelty and evolution. It grounds creativity and freedom within the framework's dynamics, positing that a healthy system must remain in resonant contact with its own field of possible futures to avoid stagnation.

      justification: |
        Prospective Coherence quantifies the richness of available future paths, which is conceptually analogous to the measure over all possible trajectories in a path integral formulation. In statistical mechanics, this corresponds to the volume of accessible phase space (Ω), where a larger volume implies greater potential for novelty and change.

# Prospective Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The component of the Temporal Coherence vector (**K**<sub>τ</sub>) that quantifies a system's resonance with its own future potential. *K*<sub>p</sub> measures the richness and viability of the available low-resistance evolutionary paths (geodesics) accessible to the system. It manifests as adaptability, creativity, and quantum uncertainty, representing a system's capacity for change.

## EFT-First Summary
Prospective Coherence, *K*<sub>p</sub>, can be conceptualized as a scalar field parameterizing the density of accessible low-action paths in a system's future. In a statistical mechanics analogy, it is proportional to the logarithm of the accessible phase space volume (ln Ω). A low *K*<sub>p</sub> indicates a 'frozen' or classical system with a single dominant trajectory, while a high *K*<sub>p</sub> signifies a 'quantum' or complex system with a rich superposition of potential futures.
