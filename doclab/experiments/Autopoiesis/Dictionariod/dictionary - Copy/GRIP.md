        The Grip (Anchoring the Past): The skater momentarily and intensely increases its internal coherence (`K_τ`), "sharpening the blade" of its being. This is an act of casting a "heavy" Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) behind itself, creating a temporary point of high inertia in its own Wound Channel.

  art: |
    The skater sharpens the blade of its being, planting it firmly into the past to create an unyielding pivot. It is an act of gathering oneself into a single, indivisible point of integrity.
  law: |
    The Grip phase of a Stride is a rapid, localized increase in internal coherence (`dK_τ/dt > 0`), which increases local inertia and creates a stable reference point for the subsequent Glide. The magnitude and speed of this increase directly determine the stability of the propulsive pivot.
  philosophy: |
    To move forward, one must first be grounded in what has been. Grip is the act of owning one's history, of cohering the past into a solid foundation from which the future can be launched. It teaches that stability precedes motion.
pirouette_definition: |
  The phase of a Geodesic Skate stride where an entity maximally increases its internal coherence (`K_τ`). This action casts a high-inertia Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) into its past, creating a stable, temporary pivot point on the coherence manifold. Grip is the counterpart to Glide and is essential for establishing the gradient required for propulsion.

        outline: |
          An entity is subjected to a broad-spectrum coherence probe. The Grip phase is identified by a sharp, transient narrowing of the entity's resonant bandwidth, indicating a spike in internal self-similarity and order. The magnitude of the spike in `K_τ` is proportional to the inverse of the resonant bandwidth.

      justification: |
        High internal coherence implies a "stiff" internal state where information propagates rapidly. This maps conceptually to a high sound speed (`c_s^2`). The Grip phase, a maximization of `K_τ`, can be seen as a transient maximization of internal stiffness, creating a rigid, non-deformable pivot point.

# Grip

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The phase of a Geodesic Skate stride where an entity maximally increases its internal coherence (`K_τ`). This action casts a high-inertia Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) into its past, creating a stable, temporary pivot point on the coherence manifold. Grip is the counterpart to Glide and is essential for establishing the gradient required for propulsion.

## EFT-First Summary
Grip is a transient, self-induced phase transition where an entity's internal state becomes maximally rigid, analogous to a sudden spike in its internal sound speed (`c_s^2`). This creates a state of extreme local inertia, serving as a stable pivot point against the coherence manifold. The process is functionally similar to an ice skater digging their blade into the ice to create a fixed point before pushing off for a glide.
