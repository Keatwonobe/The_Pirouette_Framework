        The dynamic balance between these strategies defines the health, agency, and evolution of any system.

triad:
  art: |
    To be an agent is to navigate a paradox: to carve a riverbed so being can flow with purpose, and to become rain to find higher ground. Dynamic Equipoise is the wisdom of knowing when to be the chisel and when to be the cloud.
  law: |
    Optimal long-term system evolution (maximization of the coherence integral S_p) requires periodic, controlled alternation between Will (local K_τ maximization) and Freedom (global V_Γ search). This strategy prevents capture in suboptimal local optima (Stagnation) or decoherence through aimless wandering (Drift).
  philosophy: |
    This state represents the synthesis of being and becoming. It is the core of all healthy, adaptive agency, allowing a system to grow and learn without dissolving its identity. It is the practical expression of wisdom in a changing universe.
pirouette_definition: |
  The optimal, healthy state of an agent, characterized by a balanced fluctuation between the Will and Freedom strategies. Will (exploitation) deepens the current Wound Channel to maximize immediate Temporal Coherence (K_τ). Freedom (exploration) samples the coherence manifold to find new, more globally optimal paths. Dynamic Equipoise is the process of alternating between these strategies to achieve sustained, adaptive growth, manifesting as Laminar Flow and avoiding the pathologies of Stagnation and Drift.

        outline: |
          Measure the variance of a system's core Ki pattern over a significant duration. Sustained low variance indicates Stagnation (Will-dominant). Sustained high variance indicates Drift (Freedom-dominant). Dynamic Equipoise is identified by a time-series showing distinct epochs of low variance (exploitation) punctuated by brief, controlled periods of high variance (exploration).

        pitfalls: [Mistaking chaotic fluctuation (Turbulent Flow) for purposeful exploration, Sampling only during an exploitation epoch and misdiagnosing the system as Stagnant.]

      **Dynamic Equipoise (The Agile Path):** Balanced fluctuation between reinforcing `K_τ` and searching the manifold. **Laminar Flow**. Adaptive, resilient, creative, and effective. The optimal state of learning and growth.
  - module: DOMA-067
    excerpt: |
      The dynamic balance between these two strategies is the essence of all adaptive and intelligent agency, from the quantum to the psychological.

      justification: |
        Dynamic Equipoise is the Pirouette formalization of an optimal policy for the exploration-exploitation problem. Will maps to exploitation (choosing the current best-known option to maximize reward/coherence now), while Freedom maps to exploration (trying new options to discover a better global optimum). The goal is to maximize long-term integrated coherence (S_p).

      confidence: 0.9
  adopted:
    - target: Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off
      rationale: The mapping is functionally and conceptually direct. The module text explicitly uses the terms 'exploitation' and 'exploration' to define Will and Freedom.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "In a dynamic environment, a system maintained in Dynamic Equipoise will achieve a higher long-term integrated coherence (S_p) than a system locked into either pure Will (Stagnation) or pure Freedom (Drift)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Persistent observation of a purely exploitative (Stagnant) or purely exploratory (Drift) system outperforming an adaptive (Equipoise) system in a complex, unpredictable environment over a statistically significant duration."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from simple 'equilibrium', which implies a static, resting balance. Dynamic Equipoise is an active, oscillating process of moving between two strategic poles. It is a non-equilibrium steady state, not a fixed central point.
