    A lens which does not merely focus light, but collapses noise into meaning. It is the instrument that builds a mirror to see a system's true, resonant face.
  law: |
    A chosen fractal geometry, when acted upon by a Collapse Operator, transforms a raw data stream into a time-series of (Tₐ, Γ, ϕ) vectors, certified as an ϵ-accurate representation of the original system's dynamics.
  philosophy: |
    Reality does not speak in the native tongue of analysis. The URL provides the necessary translation, making the chaotic dynamics of a system legible to the Pirouette framework so that diagnosis and healing can begin. It embodies the principle of "See, then Solve."
pirouette_definition: |
  A protocol and instrument that translates high-dimensional, raw system data (e.g., text, sensor logs) into the low-dimensional Pirouette field space of Time-Adherence (Tₐ), Gladiator Force (Γ), and Phase (ϕ). It operates via the "Coherent Collapse" process: projecting the data onto a chosen isomorphic fractal geometry via a Collapse Operator, which is guaranteed by the Dimension-Collapse Lemma to produce an ϵ-accurate representation. The URL is the essential first stage of any coherence audit.

          1. **Select Geometry:** Choose a candidate fractal from the Fractal Menu hypothesized to be isomorphic to the system's underlying dynamics.
          2. **Project Data:** Apply the Collapse Operator to project the raw data stream (S_raw) onto the chosen fractal geometry (F_geo).
          3. **Emit Field:** The output is a certified, ϵ-accurate time-series of (Tₐ, Γ, ϕ) vectors, ready for analysis.

    excerpt: |
      Before a system can be analyzed, its dynamics must be translated into the native language of the framework: the core fields of Time-Adherence (Tₐ), Gladiator Force (Γ), and Phase (ϕ). This is the function of the Universal Resonance Lens (URL) Forge. The URL is the instrument that turns the "what is happening" of raw data into the "how it resonates" of field dynamics.
  - module: INST-NALY-001
    excerpt: |
      A Weaver observing a debate would use the URL to transform the transcript into a flow of coherence data. They would then feed that data into the RPA to discover that, for instance, 85% of the debate's coherence loss originated from just three specific logical fallacies used by one participant. The path from noise to insight is direct and calculable.

        The URL transforms high-dimensional, noisy data into a structured, lower-dimensional representation (the 3 Pirouette fields). This is the core function of dimensionality reduction techniques. The "fractal geometry" acts as a structured prior or manifold, similar to how algorithms like Isomap or LLE operate. The "Dimension-Collapse Lemma" serves a similar role to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, guaranteeing a low-distortion embedding.

# Universal Resonance Lens

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A protocol and instrument that translates high-dimensional, raw system data (e.g., text, sensor logs) into the low-dimensional Pirouette field space of Time-Adherence (Tₐ), Gladiator Force (Γ), and Phase (ϕ). It operates via the "Coherent Collapse" process: projecting the data onto a chosen isomorphic fractal geometry via a Collapse Operator, which is guaranteed by the Dimension-Collapse Lemma to produce an ϵ-accurate representation. The URL is the essential first stage of any coherence audit.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Universal Resonance Lens functions as a sophisticated dimensionality reduction technique, analogous to manifold learning algorithms in machine learning. It projects a high-dimensional raw data stream onto a pre-defined basis (a 'fractal geometry') to extract the core Pirouette field dynamics. This process is guaranteed to be a low-error, ϵ-accurate embedding by the framework's Dimension-Collapse Lemma.
