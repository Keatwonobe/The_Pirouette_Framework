    A map of a system's pain. It does not show where the machine is broken, but where it hurts, rendering the ghost of a missing harmony as a visible wound.
  law: |
    The Deviation Field Δ𝓛 is the scalar magnitude of the difference between a system's expected (geodesic) Pirouette Lagrangian and its observed (actual) Pirouette Lagrangian at any point in its state space: Δ𝓛 = |𝓛_p(expected) - 𝓛_p(actual)|.
  philosophy: |
    To diagnose a system, one does not need to learn the signature of every possible failure. One must only know the signature of perfect health so intimately that any deviation from it becomes the most obvious signal in the system.
pirouette_definition: |
  A scalar field, Δ𝓛, defined over a system's state space, that quantifies the magnitude of dissonance at each point. It is calculated as the absolute difference between the system's ideal Pirouette Lagrangian, defined by its geodesic blueprint (`𝓛_p(expected)`), and its measured, real-time Lagrangian (`𝓛_p(actual)`). The field's topology reveals the location, severity, and nature of systemic pathologies.

        outline: |
          1. Define the system's ideal state evolution as a `GeodesicBlueprint` (𝓛_p(expected)).
          2. Ingest a real-time `ActualStream` of system state data to calculate 𝓛_p(actual).
          3. Compute the scalar field Δ𝓛 = |𝓛_p(expected) - 𝓛_p(actual)| over the system's state space.
          4. Identify and classify contiguous regions where Δ𝓛 exceeds a baseline `FaultThreshold (δ)`.

        pitfalls: [An inaccurate or outdated Geodesic Blueprint will produce a meaningless Δ𝓛 field. High sensor noise in the ActualStream can create false-positive fault loci.]

    excerpt: |
      The process is a three-step dance:
      1. **Forge the Geodesic Blueprint:** Define the system's expected, ideal state.
      2. **Observe the Actual Flow:** Measure the system's real-time, actual state.
      3. **Calculate the Gradient:** The difference between the two, the **Deviation Field (Δ𝓛)**, is a direct, quantitative measure of the system's "pain" or inefficiency. This field is the primary output of the Auditor; its peaks and troughs form a **Coherence Audit Map** of systemic stress.
  - module: DOMA-172
    excerpt: |
      The output of the Auditor is not just a map of "faults"; it is a direct diagnosis of systemic pathology. The geometry of the dissonance, read through the `Caduceus Lens` (DYNA-003), reveals its nature:
      *   **Coherence Fever (Turbulence):** Appears as a chaotic, high-frequency region of dissonance.
      *   **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnation):** Appears as a "hole" or "void"...
      *   **Coherence Erosion (Decay):** Appears as a low-level, widespread, and slowly growing field of dissonance.

      justification: |
        Both Δ𝓛 and the χ² statistic provide a scalar measure of the discrepancy between an observed dataset (actual state) and a theoretical model (geodesic). A high value in either indicates a significant deviation or "poor fit," signaling an unmodeled effect or system pathology. In this sense, a Coherence Audit Map is operationally analogous to a map of χ² residuals.

  collisions: [The symbol Δ is commonly used for the Laplacian operator (Δf = ∇²f). In this context, Δ𝓛 is not the Laplacian of the Lagrangian.]
  disambiguation: |
    Always interpret Δ in Δ𝓛 as a finite difference operator representing deviation: `ΔX ≡ |X_expected - X_actual|`. It measures the magnitude of a difference, not a spatial second derivative.

# Deviation Field

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A scalar field, Δ𝓛, defined over a system's state space, that quantifies the magnitude of dissonance at each point. It is calculated as the absolute difference between the system's ideal Pirouette Lagrangian, defined by its geodesic blueprint (`𝓛_p(expected)`), and its measured, real-time Lagrangian (`𝓛_p(actual)`). The field's topology reveals the location, severity, and nature of systemic pathologies.

## EFT-First Summary
The Deviation Field is operationally analogous to a **residual field** in statistics or an **error signal** in control theory. Just as a chi-squared (χ²) test quantifies the "badness of fit" between a model and data, the Δ𝓛 field quantifies the misfit between a system's actual behavior and its ideal, "healthy" behavior. Regions of high Δ𝓛 indicate significant, unmodeled dynamics, which Pirouette classifies as pathologies like turbulence or stagnation.
