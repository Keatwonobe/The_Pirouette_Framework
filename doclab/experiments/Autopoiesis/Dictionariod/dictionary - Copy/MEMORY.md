  art: |
    A scar etched into the fabric of coherence where the storm of turbulence once passed. It is the ghost of a cycle, shaping the next flow before it begins, turning experience into instinct.
  law: |
    The net change in baseline manifold curvature (ŒîŒ∫‚ÇÄ) after a full laminar-turbulent-laminar cycle is non-zero and proportional to the integrated turbulent intensity (‚à´|‚Ñ≠|dt) during the cycle. A system with Œ∫_mem ‚â† 0 will exhibit a different critical threshold Œì_c for subsequent transitions.
  philosophy: |
    Memory is not stored in a discrete substrate, but in the very geometry of a system's phase space. Crisis and collapse are not erased; they reshape the landscape, biasing future paths toward either resilience or fragility, thus encoding history into form.
pirouette_definition: |
  Œ∫-memory is the persistent, non-volatile change in the baseline curvature (Œ∫‚ÇÄ) of a coherence manifold (e.g., ùìú‚ÇÉ) following a complete laminar-turbulent-laminar cycle. This structural imprint, encoded as a topological alteration, biases the system's future dynamic pathways and resilience to subsequent temporal pressure (Œì). It represents the geometric residue of a system's history of coherence transitions.

          1. In a stable laminar regime (Œì << Œì_c), measure the baseline manifold curvature Œ∫‚ÇÄ by analyzing the geodesic deviation of coherence flow trajectories.
          2. Induce a turbulent cycle by ramping temporal pressure Œì past the critical threshold Œì_c, then allowing the system to relax back into a stable laminar state.
          3. Re-measure the baseline curvature Œ∫'‚ÇÄ.
          4. The Œ∫-memory is quantified as Œ∫_mem = |Œ∫'‚ÇÄ - Œ∫‚ÇÄ|.

        Like plastic deformation in a material, Œ∫-memory is an irreversible change to the system's underlying structure (manifold curvature) caused by stress (a Œì-driven turbulent cycle). This change alters the system's future response to stress, analogous to how work hardening increases a material's yield strength. The manifold does not return to its original shape after the "load" is removed.

# Œ∫-memory

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Œ∫-memory is the persistent, non-volatile change in the baseline curvature (Œ∫‚ÇÄ) of a coherence manifold (e.g., ùìú‚ÇÉ) following a complete laminar-turbulent-laminar cycle. This structural imprint, encoded as a topological alteration, biases the system's future dynamic pathways and resilience to subsequent temporal pressure (Œì). It represents the geometric residue of a system's history of coherence transitions.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to plastic deformation or strain hardening in condensed matter physics, Œ∫-memory is the non-recoverable change in the system's phase-space geometry following a high-stress event. The application of temporal pressure (Œì) beyond a critical threshold induces a turbulent cycle that acts like a mechanical load, deforming the coherence manifold. This 'work hardening' of the manifold alters the energy landscape and geodesic pathways for future dynamics, encoding a memory of past turbulence that can measurably change the system's future resilience and critical thresholds.
