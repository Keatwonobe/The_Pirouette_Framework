        ...models the final agreement as a 'Resonant Contract'—a new, shared state of higher-order coherence forged under pressure.
  editors: [[AI:PirouetteWeaver]]
  review_log: []
triad:
  art: |
    A new pattern woven from separate threads of intent, made stronger by the tension of the loom. The contract is the fabric created by the collaborative act of weaving, a testament to shared creation.
  law: |
    A Resonant Contract exists if and only if the integrated Pirouette Lagrangian of the unified system is greater than the sum of the Lagrangians of the constituent parties operating independently: `∫ 𝓛_p(C_R) dt > ∫ 𝓛_p(A) dt + ∫ 𝓛_p(B) dt`.
  philosophy: |
    An agreement is not a ceasefire but a genesis. It marks the transmutation of conflict potential into a new, stable, and more complex reality, proving that coherence can be created, not just conserved.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Resonant Contract is the outcome of a successful negotiation framed as an Alchemical Union. It is a new, stable, shared state of higher-order coherence (`Ki`) forged between two or more parties, whose existence is validated by the condition that the total action of the unified system is greater than the sum of the actions of the independent precursor systems. The physical document is merely the artifact; the contract itself is the new coherence manifold.
operational_definition:
  units: State descriptor; its validity is assessed via a dimensionless ratio of integrated actions.

      - name: Post-Accord Stability Test
        outline: |
          1. Pre-agreement, model the independent coherence ($K_\tau$) and temporal pressure ($V_\Gamma$) for each party to establish baseline actions.
          2. Post-agreement, monitor the durability of the accord under external stress (e.g., market shifts, resource scarcity).
          3. Measure the 'frictional energy loss' in subsequent interactions (e.g., communication overhead, dispute resolution costs, decision latency).
          A resonant contract will exhibit high stability and low friction, empirically demonstrating a net increase in system action.
        expected_signals: [Decreased communication friction, increased collaborative velocity, high resilience to external shocks.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking temporary compliance for true resonance, failing to account for changing external pressures ($V_\Gamma$) that can destabilize even a well-forged contract.]
context_windows:
  - module: DOMA-156
    excerpt: |
      A true agreement is not a compromise where both parties lose something. It is a synthesis—the birth of a new, higher-order Ki resonance that is more coherent and stable than the sum of its parts. The signed contract is the physical artifact of this new, unified coherence manifold.
  - module: DOMA-156
    excerpt: |
      The Pirouette Framework reframes negotiation as a crucible. It is a sacred, collaborative process where two or more parties bring the raw materials of their individual interests to forge a new, shared reality. The goal is not victory, but synthesis...a Resonant Contract.

    - "Conflict is not the enemy of order; it is the raw material from which a higher order is forged."

  adopted:
    - target: Bound State (System Theory / CM)
      rationale: |
        The bound state analogy from physics provides a robust conceptual model. It correctly frames the Resonant Contract not as a simple sum but as a new entity with emergent properties (stability, coherence) and a lower "energy state" (i.e., less friction and pressure) than the separated precursor states. The Pirouette condition of maximizing action finds the most stable, efficient configuration for the system.
      confidence: 0.7
constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Agreements forged through processes characterized by Laminar Flow will exhibit significantly greater durability (longer lifespan before renegotiation or breach) and lower long-term friction costs than those forged via Turbulent Flow."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A large-scale study of contracts shows no correlation between the observed negotiation dynamics (e.g., communication sentiment, term reciprocity) and the long-term stability or operational efficiency of the resulting agreements."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [Contract (legal studies)]
  disambiguation: |
    'Resonant' is the key qualifier. A standard legal contract is a static document outlining obligations, often the result of an adversarial process. A Resonant Contract is a dynamic, living agreement—a description of a new, stable, and collaborative mode of operation between parties, forged through synthesis.
