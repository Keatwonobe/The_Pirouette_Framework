    Where the Higgs field curves the energy of space, the Pressuron bends the rhythm of time. Their coupling is the shared beat, an indivisible resonance that gives mass both inertia and memory.
  law: |
    The interaction between the Higgs and Pressuron fields, governed by the coupling λ_HΓ, must induce a +0.1% to +0.3% increase in the total Higgs decay width and enhance the H→e⁺e⁻ branching ratio to ~10⁻⁷, an order of magnitude above the Standard Model prediction.
  philosophy: |
    The coupling represents the pressure-density cross-term in the universe's equation of temporal state. It links electroweak vacuum stability to cosmic coherence, framing the Higgs not just as a giver of mass, but as a participant in the dynamic unfolding of time itself.
pirouette_definition: |
  The dimensionless mixing constant, λ_HΓ, that determines the interaction strength between the Higgs field (H, coherence density) and the Pressuron field (Γ, temporal pressure). It is the coefficient of the simplest gauge-invariant interaction term, `L_int = λ_HΓ H†H Γ²`, which modifies Higgs phenomenology at the electroweak scale.

      The simplest gauge-invariant coupling consistent with Pirouette symmetry is L_int = λ_HΓ H†H Γ², where (λ_HΓ) is a dimensionless mixing constant determined by coherence boundary conditions at the electroweak plateau. This term induces both a shift in the Higgs self-energy and new loop-level decay channels.

      The Higgs field represents the **density of coherence**, while Γ encodes **temporal pressure**. Their coupling is therefore the *pressure-density cross-term* in the equation of temporal state. At resonance, the two fields share energy, letting the Higgs “breathe” in time: a periodic modulation of its vacuum expectation value.

        The interaction `λ_HΓ H†H Γ²` is mathematically identical to the simplest form of a "Higgs Portal," where a new gauge-singlet scalar field (S, here represented by Γ) couples to the Standard Model via the Higgs bilinear operator `H†H`. This is a well-studied renormalizable operator in BSM physics that induces Higgs mixing and new decay channels.

    λ_HΓ refers specifically to the coefficient of the `H†H Γ²` operator. It should be distinguished from the symbol Γ for the Pressuron field and the symbol Γ_H for the Higgs decay width. Context is critical: λ_HΓ is a dimensionless constant, Γ is a field, and Γ_H has units of energy.

# Higgs-Γ coupling

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Higgs-Γ coupling, symbolized by λ_HΓ, is the dimensionless constant governing the interaction between the Higgs field (H), which represents coherence density, and the Pressuron field (Γ), which represents temporal pressure. It is defined via the simplest gauge-invariant Lagrangian term, `L_int = λ_HΓ H†H Γ²`. This interaction modifies Higgs phenomenology, linking electroweak vacuum stability to cosmic coherence and producing measurable signatures at colliders.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of effective field theory, the Higgs-Γ coupling is a direct instance of a "Higgs Portal" interaction. It introduces a new gauge-singlet scalar field (the Pressuron, Γ) that couples to the Standard Model via the unique renormalizable operator `H†H`. This portal, `L_portal = λ_HΓ Γ² |H|²`, induces mixing between the Higgs and Pressuron sectors, leading to concrete, testable predictions: a small increase in the Higgs total width and an enhancement of its rare dilepton decays.
