        Defines mastery as the state where a desired skill becomes a geodesic‚Äîa path of maximal coherence‚Äîmaking its performance not just effortless, but the system's most natural state of flow.

  art: |
    To practice is to carve a groove into the landscape of the self. Mastery is when that groove becomes a riverbed, and the water of action flows through it without thought or effort.
  law: |
    Mastery is the state where the Pirouette Lagrangian for a specific skill path, ùìõ_p(skill), is consistently and significantly greater than the Lagrangian for any competing habitual path, ùìõ_p(habit). The system defaults to the mastered skill because it is the path of maximal coherence over time.
  philosophy: |
    Mastery asserts that an agent's internal landscape is not fate. It is the disciplined, sacred work of using attention and repetition to sculpt the self one intends to become, transforming accidental paths into deliberate highways of being.
pirouette_definition: |
  Mastery is the state achieved when a skill, through Resonant Repetition, has sculpted a Wound Channel (CORE-011) so deep within an agent's coherence manifold that it becomes a geodesic‚Äîa path of maximal coherence (KœÑ) and minimal Temporal Pressure (V_Œì). The performance of the skill is no longer an act of will but a state of Laminar Flow (DYNA-001), as it represents the system's most natural and energy-efficient action.

        outline: |
          Present an agent with a choice between the mastered skill path and an easier, habitual alternative under varying levels of induced Temporal Pressure (Œì). A mastered skill will be chosen consistently, with lower latency, even under high pressure, as its Lagrangian remains dominant.
        expected_signals: [Consistent, low-latency selection of the skill path, physiological markers of Laminar Flow (e.g., reduced heart rate variability, coherent EEG patterns) during execution.]
        pitfalls: [Confounding variables (e.g., external motivation overriding the natural Lagrangian path), measurement intrusion altering agent coherence.]

    excerpt: |
      For the master, the terrain has been transformed. The chaotic wilderness is now home to a deep, stable, and elegant groove‚Äîa well-carved Wound Channel. This groove is a geodesic, a path of maximal coherence. To perform the skill is to simply "fall" into this channel and follow its effortless contour.
  - module: DOMA-161
    excerpt: |
      Mastery is achieved when the Lagrangian for the desired skill path, ùìõ_p(skill), is consistently higher than that of any competing habit, ùìõ_p(habit). The universe's own optimization principle now works for the practitioner. The agent doesn't *choose* the mastered action so much as they are *drawn* to it by their own, newly sculpted, fundamental drive to maximize coherence.

        Mastery reshapes the agent's internal "potential" landscape (V_Œì) so that the desired skill trajectory becomes the one that extremizes the action integral. The effortless flow of the master is analogous to a physical system following a path of least action, as described by its Lagrangian.

      justification: |
        The deeply carved Wound Channel of a mastered skill acts as a strong attractor in the state space of the agent's behavior. Practice deepens this basin of attraction, making it more probable that the system's trajectory will converge to the skill's performance under a wide range of initial conditions.

  adopted:
    - target: Principle of Stationary Action
      rationale: The direct use of a Lagrangian formalism in DOMA-161 makes this the most direct and intended mapping. It correctly frames practice as the work of altering the "potential" term to make a desired path "natural" for the system.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, Mastery is not a social rank, a final endpoint, or a state of dominance. It is a specific, measurable geometric and energetic state of an agent-system, defined by the dominance of a skill's Lagrangian. It is a dynamic equilibrium, not a static achievement.

# Mastery

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Mastery is the state achieved when a skill, through Resonant Repetition, has sculpted a Wound Channel (CORE-011) so deep within an agent's coherence manifold that it becomes a geodesic‚Äîa path of maximal coherence (KœÑ) and minimal Temporal Pressure (V_Œì). The performance of the skill is no longer an act of will but a state of Laminar Flow (DYNA-001), as it represents the system's most natural and energy-efficient action.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of classical mechanics, Mastery reconfigures an agent's internal phase space such that the trajectory corresponding to the desired skill becomes the path of stationary action. Practice is the work that alters the potential energy landscape (V_Œì), creating a "potential well" or "geodesic" that the system naturally follows, minimizing the action integral as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian. This is a direct conceptual mapping to the Principle of Stationary Action.
