    The vertex is the energetic toll for two clocks—one inside a particle, one in the surrounding medium—to agree on what "now" means as they move past each other.
  law: |
    The interaction term `q\bar\Psi\gamma^\mu A_\mu\Psi` emerges from the covariant derivative `D_\mu = \nabla_\mu - iqA_\mu` in the Dirac Lagrangian. It represents the work required to synchronize the spinor's internal U(1) phase with the background gauge field `A_\mu`. The coupling `q` is quantized due to the topological (Berry phase) requirement that the spinor's wavefunction be single-valued.
  philosophy: |
    The fundamental electromagnetic interaction is not an ad-hoc rule but an emergent consequence of maintaining local time-phase coherence. The gauge principle is reframed as a physical principle of clock synchronization between matter (a topological defect) and the medium it inhabits.

  The interaction term in the Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) Lagrangian that represents the energetic cost of maintaining phase coherence between a Ki-defect spinor's internal U(1) clock (`\Psi`) and the temporal medium's local time-phase reference (`A_\mu`). It is derived by promoting the partial derivative to a covariant derivative (`\nabla_\mu \to D_\mu = \nabla_\mu - iqA_\mu`) in the Dirac kinetic term. Its coupling strength, the charge `q`, is quantized by a Berry phase constraint on the spinor's underlying Ki-loop topology, ensuring charge universality for all defects coupled to the single U(1) time-phase.

          Measure particle scattering cross-sections (e.g., e⁻e⁻ → e⁻e⁻, e⁻γ → e⁻γ) where this interaction is the leading-order contribution. The vertex strength is inferred by fitting the experimental data to the theoretical amplitude calculated from Feynman rules, where this term corresponds to the vertex factor `-iqγ^\mu`.

# QED Vertex

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The interaction term in the Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) Lagrangian that represents the energetic cost of maintaining phase coherence between a Ki-defect spinor's internal U(1) clock (`\Psi`) and the temporal medium's local time-phase reference (`A_\mu`). It is derived by promoting the partial derivative to a covariant derivative (`\nabla_\mu \to D_\mu = \nabla_\mu - iqA_\mu`) in the Dirac kinetic term. Its coupling strength, the charge `q`, is quantized by a Berry phase constraint on the spinor's underlying Ki-loop topology, ensuring charge universality for all defects coupled to the single U(1) time-phase.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette QED Vertex is mathematically identical to the standard QED interaction Lagrangian, `\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = e\bar\psi\gamma^\mu A_\mu\psi`, which describes the coupling of a charged fermion (a Dirac field `\psi`) to the photon (the gauge field `A_\mu`). The framework provides an alternative derivation where this term is not postulated via the gauge principle but emerges from the physical requirement of keeping the fermion's internal phase clock synchronized with a dynamic background time-phase field. This approach naturally leads to the quantization and universality of charge (`e`) through a topological Berry phase argument.
