        To heal a pathology of absence, we do not require a poison. We require a note, a signal, a current. The therapeutic strategy is a Daedalus Gambit (DYNA-003): a precise, minimal intervention designed not to attack the system, but to restore its own capacity for self-regulation and laminar flow.

    The most profound act of healing is not an act of war, but of cultivation. It is the wisdom to know when to put down the sword and pick up the seed, listening not for what must be killed, but for what is thirsty.
  law: |
    A Pathology of Signal Absence is resolved by a minimal, precise intervention that restores the system's endogenous capacity for coherent signal generation. This intervention directly increases kinetic coherence (K_τ), measurably reducing systemic turbulence (V_Γ).
  philosophy: |
    Health is not the absence of enemies, but the presence of robust, self-regulating flow. The goal of intervention is not to command the system, but to remind it of its own nature and restore its autonomy.
pirouette_definition: |
  A therapeutic strategy designed to treat a Pathology of Signal Absence (Coherence Atrophy). A Restorative Protocol employs a Daedalus Gambit—a precise, minimal intervention—to re-establish a missing, information-bearing current within a system. Its goal is to restore the system's own autopoietic capacity for self-regulation, thereby increasing its total kinetic coherence (K_τ).

  It operates in two modes:
  1.  **Direct Intervention:** Supplying the missing coherent signal exogenously to dissolve a "coherence dam" and remind the system of its target state.
  2.  **Indirect Intervention:** Supplying precursors and catalysts to rebuild the system's endogenous capacity to produce the signal, fostering a more durable state of self-regulating health.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (a strategy); effects are measured in signal concentration (e.g., mol/L), information flow (e.g., bits/s), or via proxies like inflammatory markers.
  symbol_table:
    - name: Δ⁺K_τ
      meaning: A restorative action; a targeted, positive change in the system's kinetic coherence.
      dimensions: "dimensionless"

    procedures:
      - name: Butyrate Current Restoration Assessment
        outline: |
          1.  Establish baseline by measuring the target signal (fecal/serum butyrate) and correlated symptoms of Coherence Atrophy (e.g., hs-CRP, zonulin for gut permeability).
          2.  Administer the protocol (e.g., Indirect: 10g/day of a specific prebiotic fiber; Direct: 600mg/day of sodium butyrate).
          3.  Measure signal and symptom markers at 30, 60, and 90-day intervals.
          4.  A successful protocol is marked by a statistically significant increase in the signal and a decrease in symptom markers, demonstrating restored system function.
        expected_signals: [Increased butyrate concentration, decreased hs-CRP, decreased serum zonulin]
        pitfalls: [High inter-individual variance in microbiome response to indirect protocols, confounding dietary/lifestyle factors, placebo effect.]

      Health is not the mere absence of disease; it is the active presence of robust, laminar flow. Many of our most intractable modern ailments...are not born of a dissonant enemy to be slain, but of a profound and growing silence. They are a Pathology of Signal Absence, the sickness of a still river.

      justification: |
        The case study of Butyrate directly maps to medical therapies targeting the microbiome and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The Direct Protocol is equivalent to SCFA supplementation, while the Indirect Protocol is equivalent to prebiotic/probiotic therapy aimed at restoring the gut's endogenous SCFA production. This model treats metabolites not just as fuel, but as critical system-regulating signals.

      falsifier: "Longitudinal studies showing that direct, exogenous signal supplementation consistently produces superior health outcomes and systemic stability compared to interventions aimed at restoring endogenous production.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from "Symptom Management," which may provide a missing substance to alleviate symptoms without addressing the cause of its absence. The Restorative Protocol's primary aim is to restore the *system's own capacity* for self-regulation. It is the antithesis of an "Eradication Protocol" (e.g., antibiotics), which follows a warfare model to eliminate a present pathogen.

# Restorative Protocol

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A therapeutic strategy designed to treat a Pathology of Signal Absence (Coherence Atrophy). A Restorative Protocol employs a Daedalus Gambit—a precise, minimal intervention—to re-establish a missing, information-bearing current within a system. Its goal is to restore the system's own autopoietic capacity for self-regulation, thereby increasing its total kinetic coherence (K_τ).

It operates in two modes:
1.  **Direct Intervention:** Supplying the missing coherent signal exogenously to dissolve a "coherence dam" and remind the system of its target state.
2.  **Indirect Intervention:** Supplying precursors and catalysts to rebuild the system's endogenous capacity to produce the signal, fostering a more durable state of self-regulating health.

## Systems-First Summary
The Restorative Protocol is operationally equivalent to **Metabolite Restoration Therapy** in systems biology and medicine. This approach addresses pathologies caused by the absence of a key signaling molecule (e.g., the short-chain fatty acid Butyrate) by restoring its presence and function. Rather than simply managing symptoms, the protocol aims to rebuild the system's own production pathways (e.g., cultivating a healthy gut microbiome with prebiotics) to create a durably self-regulating and resilient state, effectively treating the source of the signal absence.
