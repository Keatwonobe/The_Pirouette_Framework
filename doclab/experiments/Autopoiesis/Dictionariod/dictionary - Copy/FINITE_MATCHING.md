  art: |
    Running couplings are the metronome marks scribbled in the score; frame stiffnesses are the tension of the strings. Finite matching is the act of tuning the instrument at the start of the piece, ensuring the orchestra plays in time.
  law: |
    At the coherence barrier (μ_c), the inverse squared gauge couplings (1/g_i²) equal the frame stiffnesses (K_i) plus finite, scheme-dependent matching constants (Δ_i). These constants are required to be small, |Δ_i| ≪ K_i, reflecting the efficacy of the stiffness description.
  philosophy: |
    Finite matching bridges the discrete, high-energy stiffness description with the continuous, low-energy field theory description. It encodes the microscopic details of the barrier transition in a way that preserves gauge symmetry and avoids fine-tuning, making the connection between the two regimes predictive.
pirouette_definition: |
  The procedure of connecting the Pirouette frame-stiffnesses (K_i) to the Standard Model's running gauge couplings (g_i) at the coherence barrier (μ_c). This is accomplished by adding finite, gauge-invariant, and observable-independent counterterms, Δ_i, to the stiffnesses. The Δ_i are scheme-dependent constants of O(1/16π²) that absorb the mismatch between the high-energy (time-first) and low-energy (EFT) descriptions without introducing new physics or divergences.

          1. Obtain priors for frame stiffnesses {K₁, K₂, K₃} from the Resonance Atlas (XXP-BRIDGE-Γ-001).
          2. Take experimentally measured low-energy couplings, e.g., {α_EM(M_Z), sin²θ_W(M_Z), α_s(M_Z)}.
          3. Evolve these couplings up to the coherence barrier scale μ_c using 2-loop Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs). This yields {g₁(μ_c), g₂(μ_c), g₃(μ_c)}.
          4. Calculate the finite matching terms via the defining relation: Δᵢ = 1/gᵢ²(μ_c) - Kᵢ.
          5. Verify that the resulting |Δᵢ| are small relative to Kᵢ. A large required |Δᵢ| falsifies the stiffness priors.

      justification: |
        In standard EFT, when a heavy particle is integrated out at a scale M, the couplings of the low-energy theory are matched to the high-energy theory. This matching includes finite, scheme-dependent corrections (threshold corrections) in addition to the running. Pirouette's Δᵢ play the identical mathematical role, matching the low-energy running couplings to the high-energy stiffness parameters at the barrier μ_c.

    "Finite Matching" refers to finite physical constants, not the infinite counterterms used to absorb divergences in renormalization. The Δᵢ are physically meaningful (though scheme-dependent) values representing the precise interface between the high-energy stiffness model and the low-energy running EFT description.

# Finite Matching

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The procedure of connecting the Pirouette frame-stiffnesses (Kᵢ) to the Standard Model's running gauge couplings (gᵢ) at the coherence barrier (μ_c). This is accomplished by adding finite, gauge-invariant, and observable-independent counterterms, Δᵢ, to the stiffnesses. The Δᵢ are scheme-dependent constants of O(1/16π²) that absorb the mismatch between the high-energy (time-first) and low-energy (EFT) descriptions without introducing new physics or divergences.

## EFT-First Summary
Finite Matching in Pirouette is the direct analogue of **finite threshold corrections** in standard Effective Field Theory. When matching the high-energy theory (described by stiffnesses Kᵢ) to the low-energy Standard Model at the barrier scale μ_c, the couplings are related by `1/gᵢ²(μ_c) = Kᵢ + Δᵢ`. The term Δᵢ plays the same role as the finite, scheme-dependent constant that arises from integrating out heavy degrees of freedom, ensuring that physical observables are continuous across the energy threshold.
