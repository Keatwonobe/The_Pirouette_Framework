    A system is a songbook of potential melodies; its endurance is not in the strength of any single note, but in the prime, indivisible harmony of the entire composition.
  law: |
    A system is a dynamic entity whose resilience is primarily determined by the topological irreducibility of its coherence manifold, as quantified by its number of stable states (`N`). Systems with a prime `N` are maximally resilient against harmonic fracture.
  philosophy: |
    To treat a system is to understand its fundamental geometry of possibility. The goal is not merely to restore function but to architect its very potential for coherence, guiding it towards an indivisible, prime-numbered state of grace.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dynamic entity defined by its coherence manifold: the complete landscape of its potential stable states (Coherence Wells). A system's identity and resilience are not defined by its components in a static configuration, but by the topology and number (`N`) of its available resonant modes. The Prime Resonance Principle (DOMA-111) posits that systems with a prime `N` exhibit maximal topological integrity.

          1. Identify the key state variables of the entity.
          2. Perturb the entity across its state space using controlled impulses or observe its natural evolution under ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).
          3. Identify and count the distinct, stable, self-sustaining patterns of coherence (`Ki` resonances) which act as attractors.
          4. The total count of these attractors yields the Mode Number, `N`.

    excerpt: |
      The foundational shift is from a static to a dynamic ontology. The old framework spoke of "attractors" as destinations. We now understand them as stable, self-sustaining patterns of coherence—the notes in a system's potential songbook. A **system** is a coherence manifold, a landscape of possibilities. A **Coherent Mode** is a valley or basin in that landscape—a stable `Ki` resonance where the system can temporarily reside.
  - module: DOMA-111
    excerpt: |
      The resilience of a system is its ability to maintain coherence when subjected to external temporal pressure (`Γ`). The Prime Resonance Principle explains why the Mode Number (`N`) is a primary determinant of this resilience. A system with a composite number of modes, such as 6 (2x3), is topologically reducible. A system with a prime number of modes is topologically irreducible. It is a "monolithic" entity.

        The coherence manifold is conceptually isomorphic to a potential energy landscape where system states are generalized coordinates `q`. Stable Coherence Wells correspond to local minima of the potential `V(q)`, representing energetically favorable, stable configurations. The system's dynamics are transitions between these minima.

      justification: |
        The coherence manifold can be modeled as a mathematical manifold `M`, and a function `f` (e.g., action, inverse-stability) as a Morse function on it. The Mode Number `N` corresponds to the number of local minima (critical points of index 0). The Prime Resonance Principle is then a conjecture about the topological stability of manifolds with a prime number of minima.

    In Pirouette, 'System' is not a generic label for any collection of parts, but specifically refers to the *coherence manifold* itself—the dynamic landscape of possibilities. It is an ontological primitive, distinct from a mere 'assembly' or 'apparatus' which are components *within* a system.

# System

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A dynamic entity defined by its coherence manifold: the complete landscape of its potential stable states (Coherence Wells). A system's identity and resilience are not defined by its components in a static configuration, but by the topology and number (`N`) of its available resonant modes. The Prime Resonance Principle (DOMA-111) posits that systems with a prime `N` exhibit maximal topological integrity.

## EFT-First Summary
A Pirouette System is analogous to an effective field theory defined over a configuration space, where the stable states (Coherence Wells) are the vacua, or local minima of the effective potential `V_eff`. The Prime Resonance Principle is a topological constraint on `V_eff`, postulating that potentials with a prime number of minima are less susceptible to instabilities induced by external perturbations, as they lack separable sub-sectors that can be independently excited. The resilience is thus a feature of the geometry of the vacuum manifold itself.
