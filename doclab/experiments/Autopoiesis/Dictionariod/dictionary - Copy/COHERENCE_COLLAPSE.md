  art: |
    The bowstring is drawn ever tighter, but the arrow is never loosed. It is the system's silent scream; all energy is consumed by the struggle to hold itself together, with none left for the song it was meant to sing.
  law: |
    A system is in a state of Coherence Collapse if its measured Pressure (P) exhibits a sustained, non-linear increase while its Resonance (R) remains constant or decreases over the same interval. This signature, `dP/dt >> 0` while `dR/dt ‚â§ 0`, is the canonical trigger for a Tier 1 Sentinel Audit.
  philosophy: |
    Coherence Collapse is the ultimate failure of the principle of Maximal Coherence. It demonstrates that a system's survival depends not on eliminating stress, but on its capacity to metabolize that stress into resonant action. When this metabolic pathway fails, the system chokes on its own unresolved potential, proving that stability without expression is a prelude to disintegration.

  A terminal, catastrophic system state defined by the signature of Temporal Pressure (P) trending toward infinity while Temporal Coherence, or Resonance (R), stagnates or drops to zero. It represents the point at which a system can no longer transform internal and external stress into a coherent, resonant output, leading to an imminent phase transition or total system failure.

        outline: |
          Using a Tier 0 Rapid Scan, monitor time-series data for the system's Pressure (P) and Resonance (R) proxies. A collapse is indicated when the P channel shows a clear, sustained super-linear (e.g., exponential) trend while the R channel is flat, noisy without a trend, or shows a clear decay. The onset of the non-linear trend in P marks the potential start of the collapse.

    excerpt: |
      The Sentinel Trigger: A Tier 1 audit MUST be initiated when the **Pressure (P)** channel shows a sustained, anomalous increase *without* a corresponding, functional expression in the **Resonance (R)** channel. This signature‚Äîthe whisper of rising stress without release‚Äîis the canonical indicator of a system approaching a state of coherence collapse or a painful phase transition. It is the system's silent scream, its cry for help before the crisis.

    excerpt: |
      A healthy system consistently acts to maximize this value: ùìõ_p = (Resonance) - (Pressure). By monitoring these two channels, a Weaver is observing the universal principle of Maximal Coherence playing out in real time, making this lens a direct bridge from core theory to practical application.

      justification: |
        In control theory, a positive feedback loop where the output is fed back into the input causes exponential amplification, leading to saturation or destruction of the system. Coherence Collapse models this dynamically: rising Pressure (the error signal) fails to be corrected by Resonance (the control output), feeding back to create even more Pressure.

  disambiguation: |
    Coherence Collapse should be distinguished from Turbulence. Turbulence is a state of high, erratic Resonance and volatile Pressure; the system is chaotic and inefficient but still dynamically active. Coherence Collapse is a terminal state where dynamic, resonant activity ceases, and all energy is consumed by static, internal stress.

# Coherence Collapse

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A terminal, catastrophic system state defined by the signature of Temporal Pressure (P) trending toward infinity while Temporal Coherence, or Resonance (R), stagnates or drops to zero. It represents the point at which a system can no longer transform internal and external stress into a coherent, resonant output, leading to an imminent phase transition or total system failure.

## EFT-First Summary
Coherence Collapse is operationally analogous to a runaway positive feedback loop in control systems. Here, unaddressed system stress (Pressure) acts as an accumulating error signal that is no longer dampened by coherent output (Resonance), leading to exponential amplification and eventual saturation or catastrophic failure of the system. This terminal dynamic represents the ultimate failure of a system to maintain stability through coherent expression.
