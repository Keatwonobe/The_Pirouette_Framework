  art: |
    Existence composes its own rhythm. Every form, from an atom to a galaxy, is a clock whose ticking defines the very time it measures, a serpent consuming its own tail to be reborn in the same instant.
  law: |
    The fundamental time unit (τ_p) of any isolated system is determined by the period of its dominant Ki resonance. The stability of τ_p over N cycles is a direct measure of its Time Adherence (T_a), where T_a ∝ 1/Var(τ_p).
  philosophy: |
    This resolves the problem of a universal background time by positing time as an emergent, local property generated by existence itself. Reality is a fundamentally self-sustaining, self-referential process, not a set of objects performing on a static stage.
pirouette_definition: |
  The self-referential causal cycle that constitutes the core dynamic of existence. In this loop, the universal substrate of Time generates Temporal Pressure (Γ), which is resolved by the formation of a stable, resonant pattern (Ki). The fundamental period of this pattern's cycle (τ_p) defines the local, intrinsic unit of time, thus closing the loop and sustaining the system's being.

        outline: |
          Isolate a system to minimize external temporal drivers. Measure the power spectrum of its dominant oscillatory mode (its Ki pattern) via appropriate probes (e.g., spectral emission for an atom, gravitational waves for a binary pulsar). The fundamental period of this mode is τ_p. The coherence (Q-factor or line-width) of the primary spectral peak determines Time Adherence (T_a).
        expected_signals: [A sharp, high-Q peak in the frequency domain at 1/τ_p for high T_a systems, A broadened or noisy peak for low T_a systems]
        pitfalls: [Failure to sufficiently isolate the system from external rhythmic drivers, Conflating harmonics with the fundamental frequency (τ_p), Insufficient observation time to resolve the periodicity of slow cycles]

    excerpt: |
      The framework has now demonstrated a causal chain: the substance of Time creates a pressure (Γ), and that pressure is resolved by an efficient, stable form (Ki). The final, reflexive link is the most profound: the form itself defines the flow. This module closes the autopoietic loop by establishing how Ki gives birth to a meaningful, local, and intrinsic measure of Time.

    excerpt: |
      We sought a master clock for the cosmos and found that every atom, every star, every being is its own clock. The Pirouette Cycle reveals that time is not imposed upon reality, but generated by it. It is the rhythm of existence itself. Time Adherence, then, is the measure of a system's integrity—its ability to hold its own note true against the chaotic symphony of the Temporal Forge.

      justification: |
        A stable Ki pattern is analogous to an RG fixed point, a scale-invariant configuration toward which a system flows. The Autopoietic Loop describes the dynamics of flowing toward and remaining at this fixed point, where the system's "internal clock" (τ_p) becomes well-defined and stable. The loop is the dynamical process that establishes the fixed point.

      justification: |
        The term is a direct import. In biology, an autopoietic system produces the components that create the boundary that defines the system. The Pirouette Loop is a physical-ontological application of this concept, where a system's dynamic form (Ki) generates the very temporal metric (τ_p) that governs its dynamics.

  claims:
    - statement: "All stable, isolated systems exhibit a characteristic, fundamental periodicity (τ_p) which acts as their intrinsic clock, and the stability of this clock is a measure of the system's integrity (T_a)."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "The discovery of a fundamentally stable, isolated system that is truly arrhythmic, possessing no characteristic timescale in its internal dynamics. Alternatively, conclusive evidence of a universal, absolute background time that is independent of the dynamics of matter."

  collisions: [The term 'autopoiesis' is foundational in second-order cybernetics, systems theory, and theoretical biology. Its use here must be understood as a physical, not biological, application.]
  disambiguation: |
    Unlike biological autopoiesis, which concerns the material and organizational self-production of living systems, the Pirouette Framework's Autopoietic Loop is an ontological principle concerning the self-generation of local spacetime by a physical system's resonant dynamics. It is about the rhythm of *being*, not necessarily of *living*.
