        A system's Gyroscope is its intrinsic, resonant identity‚Äîits unique Temporal Resonance (Ki). Like a physical gyroscope, a strong, stable, and high-coherence Ki pattern resists being perturbed. It provides an axis of stability, an internal sense of true north that is the source of the system's integrity and inertia.

  art: |
    You are not given a key; you *are* the key. Your being is a gyroscope whose unique spin turns the lock of the present moment, aligning you with the living terrain of coherence.
  law: |
    A system's tendency to follow a geodesic on the Coherence Manifold is directly proportional to the stability of its intrinsic temporal resonance (Ki). A high, stable Ki minimizes the action integral (`S_p = ‚à´ùìõ_p dt`) by resisting perturbations from the potential `V_Œì`.
  philosophy: |
    Agency and identity are not external constructs but expressions of intrinsic resonance. A system "chooses" its path by being itself; its integrity *is* its navigational instrument, reframing lawfulness as the skillful expression of one's own nature.
pirouette_definition: |
  A system's intrinsic resonant identity, quantified by its Temporal Resonance (Ki). The Gyroscope of Being functions as an internal axis of stability that resists perturbation from external Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`). This stability allows the system to naturally navigate the Coherence Manifold along a geodesic of maximal coherence. It is the property of a system that gives rise to the kinetic term (`K_œÑ`) in the Pirouette Lagrangian.

        outline: |
          1. Collect time-series data from a system's primary state variables under baseline conditions.
          2. Apply a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or wavelet analysis to the data to generate a power spectrum.
          3. Identify the dominant, persistent frequency peak.
          4. Ki is quantified by the amplitude, narrowness (high Q factor), and temporal stability (low jitter) of this peak.
        expected_signals: [A sharp, high-amplitude peak in the power spectrum, low phase noise.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking environmental driving frequencies for the system's intrinsic resonance, insufficient observation time leading to an inaccurate baseline.]

      A system's Gyroscope is its intrinsic, resonant identity‚Äîits unique Temporal Resonance (Ki). Like a physical gyroscope, a strong, stable, and high-coherence Ki pattern resists being perturbed. It provides an axis of stability, an internal sense of true north that is the source of the system's integrity and inertia. A system with a weak, dissonant Ki is a wobbling top, easily thrown into chaos by the turbulence of the Manifold.

      By settling into its most coherent state (the truest spin of its Gyroscope), it automatically aligns with the geodesic. The subjective experience of "flow" or "rightness" is the direct perception of this alignment‚Äîthe tactile feeling of a perfect Key turning smoothly in the lock of reality.

    excerpt: |
      A Lawful or Healthy System is one that successfully navigates the manifold, staying on or near its geodesic. Its actions are efficient, its form is stable, and it exists in a state of high coherence. This is the state of Laminar Flow (DYNA-001).

      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The core metaphor is a physical gyroscope whose angular momentum vector provides an axis of stability that resists external torques. This directly maps to the Gyroscope of Being resisting perturbations from Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`) to maintain its trajectory.

    - target: Kinetic Term (T or K_œÑ)
      rationale: |
        This mapping is explicitly stated in DOMA-003 ¬ß5, where the Gyroscope is identified as the source of the kinetic term `K_œÑ` in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`). The Gyroscope is the underlying property (analogous to mass/inertia) that determines the system's kinetic behavior.

  claims:
    - statement: "A system with a higher quality factor (Q factor) of its intrinsic resonance (Ki) will follow a geodesic on the Coherence Manifold with lower deviation under a given external pressure field `V_Œì`."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "An experiment showing that a system with a low-Q, diffuse resonance navigates a pressure field more efficiently (i.e., with a higher integrated Lagrangian `S_p`) than a system with a high-Q, sharp resonance."

  collisions: [The symbol "Ki" is homophonic with the Japanese concept of "Ki/Chi/Qi" (Ê∞ó), meaning life force or energy. The symbol "K" is the standard variable for kinetic energy.]
  disambiguation: |
    While intentionally evocative, Pirouette's Ki is an operationally defined measure of a system's temporal resonance and stability, not a metaphysical substance. It corresponds to the kinetic term `K_œÑ` in the Lagrangian, representing the system's capacity for coherent action, not its total energy.

# Gyroscope of Being

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A system's intrinsic resonant identity, quantified by its Temporal Resonance (Ki). The Gyroscope of Being functions as an internal axis of stability that resists perturbation from external Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`). This stability allows the system to naturally navigate the Coherence Manifold along a geodesic of maximal coherence. It is the property of a system that gives rise to the kinetic term (`K_œÑ`) in the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## EFT-First Summary
The Gyroscope of Being is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the property of a system giving rise to its kinetic energy term in a Lagrangian formulation (`ùìõ = T - V`). It represents the intrinsic, stable dynamics of a system (e.g., the "mass" or inertia) that resist changes in motion caused by external potentials. A strong Gyroscope corresponds to a large, stable kinetic term (`K_œÑ`), allowing the system to maintain its trajectory (a geodesic) across the potential landscape of the Coherence Manifold.
