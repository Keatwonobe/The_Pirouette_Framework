  art: |
    A star sings its stability, and the pressure of its song carves a valley in the temporal manifold. Planets skate along the contours of this valley, mistaking the slope for a leash.
  law: |
    The gradient of a Coherence Well (∇Φ_Γ) dictates the geodesic for a test object, which is the path that maximizes the object's integrated coherence (K_τ) over time. Deviation from this path incurs a coherence cost proportional to the local temporal pressure gradient.
  philosophy: |
    The Coherence Well recasts gravity from an attractive force to a structural feature of the coherence manifold. It demonstrates how stability itself (a massive object) dictates the most stable paths for others, making gravity a principle of least resistance within a pre-structured environment.
pirouette_definition: |
  A large-scale, persistent gradient in the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) generated by the collective Ki resonances of a massive, stable system. A Coherence Well represents a region where the path of maximal coherence (the geodesic) is curved. Objects within the well follow this path not because of a force, but to minimize the coherence cost required to navigate the temporal pressure gradient.

          Measure the deflection angle of light from distant sources (e.g., quasars, galaxies) as it passes a massive foreground object (e.g., a galactic cluster).

    excerpt: |
      At the cosmological scale, the same feedback principle operates, but in a gentler, more linear fashion. This is gravity. A massive object, like a star, possesses an immense density of internal Ki resonances. This collective resonance doesn't create the violent spike of the strong force, but it does cause a significant, large-scale increase in the surrounding Temporal Pressure (Γ). It wraps itself in a deep "coherence well."

    excerpt: |
      An orbiting planet is not being "pulled" by a force. It is following the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—within the star's coherence well. To deviate from this orbit would require fighting against the gentle but inexorable gradient of temporal pressure, a path of lower coherence.

        The Coherence Well serves the same functional role as the gravitational potential in Newtonian physics and is closely related to the time-time component (g_00) of the metric tensor in General Relativity. It defines a scalar field whose gradient determines the 'natural' path of objects (the geodesic), which manifests as gravitational acceleration.

        This is a direct mapping of function. The operational consequences—orbital mechanics, gravitational lensing, time dilation—are intended to be identical. Pirouette provides a generative mechanism (temporal pressure from Ki resonances) for the potential, whereas GR posits it as a consequence of spacetime curvature from the stress-energy tensor.

      falsifier: "Two objects with identical stress-energy tensors but different internal compositions (e.g., a neutron star vs. a theoretical quark star of the same mass) are observed to produce identical gravitational fields to within measurement limits. Pirouette allows for subtle differences based on resonance structure, while standard GR predicts identical effects."

  disambiguation: |
    A Coherence Well is not a physical depression in space. It is a gradient in the *cost of coherence*, which manifests as a gravitational field. It is the cosmological, large-scale expression of the Gladiator Force, distinct from the sharp, non-linear potential of the strong force.

# Coherence Well

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A large-scale, persistent gradient in the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) generated by the collective Ki resonances of a massive, stable system. A Coherence Well represents a region where the path of maximal coherence (the geodesic) is curved. Objects within the well follow this path not because of a force, but to minimize the coherence cost required to navigate the temporal pressure gradient.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Well is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the **gravitational potential (Φ)** in Newtonian physics and is related to the **g_00 component of the metric tensor** in General Relativity. It describes a scalar field created by a massive object that dictates the natural, lowest-energy-cost paths (geodesics) for other objects in its vicinity. Functionally, its gradient produces the effect of gravity, including orbital mechanics and gravitational lensing. Pirouette proposes that this potential arises from the collective temporal pressure exerted by the internal resonant states of the massive body.
