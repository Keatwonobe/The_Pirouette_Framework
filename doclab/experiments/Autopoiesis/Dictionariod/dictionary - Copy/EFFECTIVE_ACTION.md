  art: |
    From a distance, the frantic dance of a million atoms blurs into the serene flow of water. The Effective Action is the choreography of that flow, remembering the dance only in the water's viscosity and temperature. It is the law of the forest, not the leaf.
  law: |
    The dynamics of coarse-grained fields, ⟨C⟩ and ⟨Γ⟩, are determined by the variational principle δS_eff = 0. The variation of S_eff with respect to the spacetime metric g_μν defines the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor, ⟨T_μν⟩, which serves as the source for emergent gravity.
  philosophy: |
    The Effective Action is the mathematical engine of emergence. It demonstrates how complex, high-frequency microscopic realities give rise to simpler, predictive macroscopic laws. It is the bridge that allows us to derive the classical world of gravity and spacetime from the underlying quantum substrate of coherence and pressure.
pirouette_definition: |
  The action functional that governs the dynamics of the coarse-grained Coherence ⟨C⟩ and Temporal Pressure ⟨Γ⟩ fields on a manifold. It is derived from the fundamental microscopic action (S_m) by functionally integrating out all sub-scale field fluctuations (δC, δΓ). The result, S_eff, contains a matter sector describing the averaged fields and a geometric sector, dominated by the Einstein-Hilbert term, that emerges from the integration process.

        outline: |
          1. Postulate a microscopic action S_m based on first principles of the Pirouette Framework.
          2. Define a coarse-graining scale L appropriate for the phenomenon (e.g., galactic scales).
          3. Calculate the predicted S_eff by performing the path integral over fluctuations, yielding expressions for emergent quantities like G, Λ, and higher-curvature couplings.
          4. Use S_eff to predict macroscopic observables (e.g., cosmological parameters H₀, Ω_Λ; gravitational lensing cross-sections).
          5. Compare predictions with observational data from cosmology and astrophysics. A statistically significant match constitutes an indirect measurement of S_eff's parameters.
        expected_signals: [Cosmological parameter values, gravitational wave signatures modified by higher-curvature terms.]
        pitfalls: [Choosing an incorrect coarse-graining scale L, incorrect assumptions about the microscopic potential V(|C|², Γ), loop calculation errors.]

    excerpt: |
      Define the effective action by integrating out sub-(L) fluctuations:
      [ e^{i S_{\text{eff}}[g;\langle C\rangle,\langle\Gamma\rangle]} \equiv \int \mathcal D\delta C, \mathcal D\delta\Gamma, e^{i S_m[C,\Gamma;g]}. ]
      By construction, the **coarse-grained stress–energy** is the metric variation of the matter part of (S_{\text{eff}}):
      [ \langle T_{\mu\nu} \rangle = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}},\frac{\delta S_{\text{eff}}^{,\text{matter}}}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} , \qquad \nabla^\mu \langle T_{\mu\nu} \rangle = 0. ]
  - module: MATH-012
    excerpt: |
      The total effective action is
      [ S_{\text{tot}} = S_{\text{geom}}[g] + S_{\text{eff}}^{,\text{matter}}[g;\langle C\rangle,\langle\Gamma\rangle]. ]
      Varying with respect to (g^{\mu\nu}) gives the macroscopic equations of motion:
      [ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G, \langle T_{\mu\nu} \rangle . ]
      Conservation is automatic: (\nabla^\mu G_{\mu\nu}=0) (Bianchi) (\Rightarrow) (\nabla^\mu\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle=0).

      rationale: The procedure outlined in MATH-012 for deriving S_eff—splitting fields into slow/coarse-grained modes and fast/fluctuating modes, then integrating out the fast modes—is a direct application of the Wilsonian Renormalization Group concept used to define the effective action in quantum and statistical field theory.

  claims:
    - statement: "The leading-order geometric term in the Pirouette S_eff is the Einstein-Hilbert action, yielding General Relativity in the macroscopic limit."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "Experimental observation of large-scale gravitational phenomena that fundamentally contradict GR and cannot be explained as corrections from the next-leading-order operators (e.g., R²) predicted by the Pirouette S_eff."
      status: proposed
      links: [MATH-012]
    - statement: "All coupling constants in S_eff (like G, Λ, and higher-curvature coefficients) are, in principle, calculable from the parameters of the microscopic action S_m."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "A robust demonstration that no set of parameters in S_m can reproduce the observed values of G and Λ simultaneously, or that the predicted higher-curvature terms are in violent conflict with observation."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol Γ is used for the Temporal Pressure field in Pirouette, whereas in QFT it is the canonical symbol for the full quantum effective action (the generator of 1PI Green's functions). Our S_eff is a classical action for averaged fields, distinct from both.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish between the **Microscopic Action (S_m)**, which describes all degrees of freedom, and the **Effective Action (S_eff)**, which describes only the low-energy, long-wavelength degrees of freedom after high-energy modes have been integrated out.
