  art: |
    To see the universal song in a particular instrument. The Lens is an act of translation, collapsing the noise of the world into a single, clean rhythm of coherence. It is the act of focusing reality.
  law: |
    For any defined system, a mapping must be established from observable, domain-specific data to the core framework variables (Kτ, Γ, Wound Channel) such that the system's evolution can be represented as a time-series of its coherence, Kτ(t). The validity of the mapping is determined by the diagnostic success of subsequent analysis.
  philosophy: |
    The framework's claim to universality rests on its translatability. The Lens operationalizes the Principle of Correspondence, asserting that no system is illegible, only untranslated. It is the necessary first step from passive observation to active diagnosis.
pirouette_definition: |
  The first stage of the Coherence Auditor protocol, responsible for translating a system's raw, domain-specific data into the core variables of the Pirouette Framework. It involves three steps:
  1. Defining the system and its boundary.
  2. Mapping domain-specific observables to Coherence (Kτ), Temporal Pressure (Γ), and the Wound Channel.
  3. Projecting the raw data through this mapping to produce a normalized time-series of the system's coherence, Kτ(t), referred to as "transcribing the song."

          1.  **Select System:** Define the entity under analysis (e.g., a corporation, an ecosystem) and its boundary.
          2.  **Posit Proxy for Kτ:** Identify a measurable, quantitative proxy for the system's stable, resonant identity. Test: Does maximizing this variable correspond to the system's flourishing state? (e.g., market share, biodiversity index, brand sentiment).
          3.  **Gather Data:** Collect historical time-series data for the chosen proxy.
          4.  **Normalize:** Apply a normalization function (e.g., min-max scaling) to the proxy data to generate the final Kτ(t) signal bounded between 0 and 1.

        The Lens is the process of identifying a low-dimensional "order parameter" (Kτ) that captures the macroscopic state or "phase" of a complex system from its high-dimensional microstates (raw data). Just as magnetization (M) captures the collective spin alignment of a ferromagnet, Kτ is chosen to capture the collective coherence of the target system.

# The Lens

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Lens is the first stage of the Coherence Auditor protocol, responsible for translating a system's raw, domain-specific data into the core variables of the Pirouette Framework. This translation is a three-step process: (1) defining the system and its boundary; (2) mapping domain-specific observables to the core variables of Coherence (Kτ), Temporal Pressure (Γ), and the Wound Channel; and (3) projecting the raw data through this mapping to produce a normalized time-series of the system's coherence, Kτ(t). This output signal, known as the system's transcribed "song," serves as the input for the diagnostic second stage, The Scalpel.

## Formal Mappings Summary
The Lens is conceptually analogous to identifying an **order parameter** in statistical mechanics. It seeks a single, low-dimensional variable (Coherence, Kτ) that effectively describes the macroscopic state of a complex system, much like magnetization describes the collective state of spins in a magnet. Operationally, it functions as a form of principled **dimensionality reduction**, collapsing a high-dimensional data space onto the single, physically meaningful axis of coherence.
