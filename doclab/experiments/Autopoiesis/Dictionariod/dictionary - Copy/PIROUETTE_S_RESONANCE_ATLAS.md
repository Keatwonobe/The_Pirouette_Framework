  art: |
    The universe is not a random jumble of forces, but a precisely tuned instrument. The Atlas is its songbook, listing the only chords that can be played, the only stable resonances the temporal medium can sustain.
  law: |
    The Atlas provides a discrete, theoretically-derived set of allowed frame-stiffness ratios (`ρ_stiff`) which serve as predictive priors for calculating fundamental constants, like the Weinberg angle, at the coherence barrier.
  philosophy: |
    The Atlas enforces physical principle over parametric freedom. It asserts that the fundamental 'constants' of nature are not arbitrary values to be measured, but are selected from a constrained set of stable resonance modes, turning post-diction into prediction.
pirouette_definition: |
  A theoretical catalog, derived from the coherence-barrier regularization conditions in XXP-BRIDGE-Γ-001, which lists the allowed, stable ratios of frame stiffnesses (e.g., `ρ_stiff = K_2/K_1`). The Atlas provides non-tunable, discrete priors for fundamental parameters, such as the Weinberg angle, transforming them from measured inputs into predictions of the framework.

        outline: |
          1. Select a candidate stiffness ratio `ρ_stiff` from the Atlas.
          2. Use this value as a boundary condition at the coherence scale `μ_c` to fix the gauge couplings `g(μ_c)` and `g'(μ_c)`.
          3. Evolve these couplings down to the electroweak scale (`M_Z`) using Standard Model Renormalization Group equations.
          4. Calculate the predicted value of `sin²θ_W(M_Z)` and compare to the high-precision experimental value.
          5. Perform a joint fit including correlated predictions (e.g., shifts in Higgs boson width `Γ_H`).

    excerpt: |
      The weak mixing angle at (μ_c) is **fixed** by the *triad-to-clock* stiffness ratio — a direct mechanical property of the temporal medium. The workflow is deterministic: 1. Choose (ρ_{stiff}) from Pirouette’s **Resonance Atlas** (XXP-BRIDGE-Γ-001). 2. Fix couplings at (μ_c). 3. RG-run to (M_Z). 4. Compare with experiment. 5. Iterate only within **Pirouette-allowed** stiffness priors.

      justification: |
        The Resonance Atlas functions similarly to swampland criteria or the selection of stable vacua in string theory. It posits that not all continuous parameter values are permissible, but only a discrete or constrained set corresponding to stable "resonance modes" of the underlying structure, thereby providing predictive power and avoiding fine-tuning.

# Pirouette's Resonance Atlas

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A theoretical catalog, derived from the coherence-barrier regularization conditions in XXP-BRIDGE-Γ-001, which lists the allowed, stable ratios of frame stiffnesses (e.g., `ρ_stiff = K_2/K_1`). The Atlas provides non-tunable, discrete priors for fundamental parameters, such as the Weinberg angle, transforming them from measured inputs into predictions of the framework.

## EFT-First Summary
In Effective Field Theory language, the Resonance Atlas is conceptually analogous to "swampland" constraints or a principle that selects a specific, stable vacuum from a "landscape." It provides a discrete set of allowed ratios for the kinetic term normalizations of the SU(2) and U(1) gauge fields (i.e., `g'²/g²`), determined at a high-energy boundary (`μ_c`). This transforms the Weinberg angle from a free parameter of the Standard Model into a predictable outcome of the framework's fundamental structure.
