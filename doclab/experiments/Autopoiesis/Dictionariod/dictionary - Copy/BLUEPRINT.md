        The Blueprint (YAML Front-matter): This is not metadata. It is the act of mapping a new idea onto the existing coherence manifold of the framework. By defining the module's `id`, `parents`, `dependencies`, and `keywords`, the Weaver performs a precise act of placement... This structured YAML is the riverbed, the stable geometry that grounds the module and gives it a place within the whole.

  art: |
    The stable geometry that grounds the flow of an idea. It is the riverbed carved into the landscape of knowledge, giving shape and direction to the living current of narrative.
  law: |
    A Blueprint must contain, at minimum, a unique `id`, a ratified `status`, and a `title`. The validity of a Blueprint is determined by its parsability as a YAML object and its successful resolution of all specified `parents` and `dependencies` within the framework's current coherence manifold.
  philosophy: |
    The Blueprint embodies the principle of *form as function*. It is a disciplined act of placement, asserting that an idea's coherence is inseparable from its declared relationships to the whole. It transforms authoring from mere description into a precise, topological act.
pirouette_definition: |
  The structured YAML front-matter of a Pirouette Module Definition (`.pmd`) file. The Blueprint is not metadata; it is the module's explicit mapping onto the framework's coherence manifold. It defines a module's identity, relational topology (parents, children, dependencies), and thematic scope (keywords), creating a stable, machine-readable structure that grounds and directs the human-readable Narrative.

        outline: |
          1. Parse the YAML front-matter of a `.pmd` file.
          2. Validate the parsed data against the Pirouette schema for required fields and data types.
          3. Recursively traverse the parent and dependency graph specified in the Blueprint.
          4. Verify that all referenced module IDs exist and are accessible within the framework's manifest.
          5. A successful traversal and validation confirms Blueprint coherence.
        expected_signals: [A structured JSON object representing the parsed Blueprint, a Boolean pass/fail result from the coherence check.]
        pitfalls: [YAML syntax errors, schema violations, broken links to non-existent modules, cyclical dependencies.]

      The Blueprint (YAML Front-matter): This is not metadata. It is the act of mapping a new idea onto the existing coherence manifold of the framework. By defining the module's `id`, `parents`, `dependencies`, and `keywords`, the Weaver performs a precise act of placement. They answer the questions: From where does this idea draw its strength? Where does it fit in the great tapestry? What other threads does it touch? This structured YAML is the riverbed, the stable geometry that grounds the module and gives it a place within the whole.

    excerpt: |
      The forge parses the YAML Blueprint to create a clean, structured JSON object—the machine-readable pattern that propagates through the framework's digital nervous system. The Signal is not for reading; it is for interacting, allowing other instruments and analytical engines to connect with the module's core logic.

      justification: |
        Like front-matter in Jekyll or Hugo, the Blueprint is a structured data block at the file's start that defines configuration and relationships. Pirouette elevates this from 'metadata' to a primary topological instrument, making the mapping a strong but partial conceptual analogue.

        The Blueprint functions as a public interface declaration for the module. It defines its identity (id, title) and its dependencies on other "classes" (modules), enforcing a structural contract that the accompanying Narrative must exist within.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'Blueprint' refers *specifically* to the machine-readable YAML front-matter of a module. It is distinguished from a general plan or schematic by its operational role in defining a module's precise topological coordinates on the coherence manifold.

# Blueprint

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The structured YAML front-matter of a Pirouette Module Definition (`.pmd`) file. The Blueprint is not metadata; it is the module's explicit mapping onto the framework's coherence manifold. It defines a module's identity, relational topology (parents, children, dependencies), and thematic scope (keywords), creating a stable, machine-readable structure that grounds and directs the human-readable Narrative.

## External Mappings Summary
The Blueprint has no direct analogue in physics but is conceptually resonant with established software engineering patterns. It functions as a declarative **Interface** for the module, similar to a class or type definition in programming. It also serves an analogous role to **Front-matter** in static site generators, providing structured data to configure and contextualize the main content block.
