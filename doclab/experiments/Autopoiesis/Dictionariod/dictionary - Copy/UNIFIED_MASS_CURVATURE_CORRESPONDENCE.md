    The weight of a thing is not its own, but the echo of a flex in time. Its substance is a measure of the geometry it inhabits, a knot of curvature in the fabric of the temporal substrate and its associated fields.
  law: |
    All forms of inertial mass arise from a single, unified geometric invariant, $\mathfrak{M}^2$, which is the sum of three distinct curvatures: the temporal substrate's Ricci scalar, the coherence field's stiffness, and the Ki-fiber's gauge curvature. This invariant must be conserved under τ-isometries and renormalization group flow.
  philosophy: |
    This principle fulfills a central tenet of the Pirouette framework: the complete geometrization of physics. By demonstrating that mass—the source of inertia and gravity—is not a fundamental property of matter but an emergent measure of composite curvature, it unifies dynamics and geometry and grounds the Equivalence Principle.
pirouette_definition: |
  The principle that all inertial mass for scalar, vector, and fermionic fields is the manifestation of a single geometric invariant, $\mathfrak{M}^2$. This invariant is the direct sum of three curvature-derived terms:
  1.  **Γ-Stiffness ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2$):** The elastic resistance of the coherence field to perturbation, analogous to a Higgs mechanism.
  2.  **Ki-Fiber Curvature ($\mathrm{Tr}(F^2)$):** The field strength of gauge interactions, averaged over the temporal substrate.
  3.  **Temporal Curvature ($\mathcal{R}_\tau$):** The Ricci scalar curvature of the temporal substrate itself.

  The full invariant is given by $\mathfrak{M}^2 = \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 + (\mathrm{Tr}(F^2) + \mathcal{R}_\tau) / (8\pi G_{\text{eff}})$.

          1. At a particle collider, measure a particle's rest mass at multiple interaction energy scales ($\Lambda$).
          2. Simultaneously, measure the running of the associated gauge coupling ($g_N$) to determine the change in the effective fiber curvature component ($\mathcal{K}_F$).
          3. Verify that the observed logarithmic shift in mass-squared is consistent with the shift in curvature, as constrained by the RG invariant $\mathcal{I}_{\text{mass}} = \mathcal{K}_F / \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2$.

      To demonstrate that all inertial masses within the Pirouette framework—scalar, vector, and fermionic—arise from a single geometric invariant: $\mathcal{M}^2 = \mathcal{R}_\tau + \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2$. This correspondence completes the equivalence between energy density, curvature, and temporal elasticity.
  - module: XAP-006D_unified_mass–curvature_correspondence
    excerpt: |
      Inertial and gravitational masses coincide because both arise from the same invariant $\mathfrak{M}$. Particles with larger fiber curvature (stronger coupling) possess higher stiffness-derived mass. As curvature renormalizes with energy, rest masses should shift logarithmically—an avenue for precision tests in high-energy scattering.

    excerpt: |
      The RG invariant $\mathcal{I}_{\text{mass}} = (\mathcal{K}_F / \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2)\,\Lambda^{-2(c_2-c_1)}$ ensures that as the gauge coupling runs, mass and curvature remain proportionally locked—a quantitative expression of “mass from curvature.”

        The principle posits that the source of spacetime curvature (the stress-energy tensor component $T_{00}$) is itself composed of more fundamental curvatures. It provides a geometric, microphysical origin for what General Relativity treats as a phenomenological source term (matter/energy).

# Unified Mass-Curvature Correspondence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Unified Mass-Curvature Correspondence is the principle that all inertial mass for scalar, vector, and fermionic fields is the manifestation of a single geometric invariant, $\mathfrak{M}^2$. This invariant is the direct sum of three curvature-derived terms:
1.  **Γ-Stiffness ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2$):** The elastic resistance of the coherence field to perturbation, analogous to a Higgs mechanism.
2.  **Ki-Fiber Curvature ($\mathrm{Tr}(F^2)$):** The field strength of gauge interactions, averaged over the temporal substrate.
3.  **Temporal Curvature ($\mathcal{R}_\tau$):** The Ricci scalar curvature of the temporal substrate itself.

The full invariant is given by $\mathfrak{M}^2 = \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 + (\mathrm{Tr}(F^2) + \mathcal{R}_\tau) / (8\pi G_{\text{eff}})$.

## EFT-First Summary
The Unified Mass-Curvature Correspondence provides a geometric origin for mass terms in the Standard Model (SM) and the stress-energy tensor in General Relativity (GR). The `Γ-stiffness` component functions analogously to the **Higgs Mechanism**, generating mass from the potential of a background coherence field. The gauge and temporal curvature components contribute to the total mass-energy density ($T_{00}$), suggesting that what GR treats as matter is, at a deeper level, the geometry of other fields. This unification makes the testable prediction that particle masses should **"run" with energy** in a way that is tightly correlated with the running of their associated gauge couplings, a core concept in quantum field theory.
