    The uneven weathering on a stone face, revealing the hidden cracks where the structure will one day fail. It is the cartography of a system's silent stresses, mapping where pressure has pooled into dangerous reservoirs.
  law: |
    A non-zero Pressure Gradient (∇Γ > 0) across a coherence manifold indicates regions of differential stress. Regions of high local contribution to the variance correspond to points of Stagnant Flow or structural impedance, predicting the most probable loci of future Coherence Erosion.
  philosophy: |
    To understand a system's failure, one must first map its struggles. The Pressure Gradient reveals not a uniform assault from chaos, but a targeted battle, showing precisely where the system's defenses are thinnest and where its internal contradictions are most acute. It is the key to predictive diagnosis.
pirouette_definition: |
  The spatial variance of **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** across a system's coherence manifold (Ki). A high Pressure Gradient indicates an uneven distribution of external stress, pinpointing structural weaknesses, blockages (**Stagnant Flow**), or regions of imminent failure where the system cannot efficiently dissipate or route pressure. It is a scalar quantity representing the degree of pressure inhomogeneity.

        outline: |
          1. Reconstruct the 3D coherence manifold (Ki) and its associated Temporal Pressure field (Γ(x,y,z)) using the Gyroid Loom protocol (DOMA-187).
          2. Calculate the mean pressure (μ_Γ) across all voxels of the manifold.
          3. Compute the variance: `∇Γ = Σ(Γ(x,y,z) - μ_Γ)² / N`, where N is the number of voxels.
          4. Generate a 3D map of the local squared deviation, `(Γ(x,y,z) - μ_Γ)²`, to visualize high-stress "hotspots".

    excerpt: |
      The output of the Loom is not just a picture; it is a diagnostic report on the system's health... **Manifold Coherence (`Kτ_manifold`)** measures how closely the reconstructed geometry fits an ideal, mathematically perfect gyroid... **Pressure Gradient (`∇Γ`)** is the variance of the temporal pressure across the manifold. High variance can pinpoint locations of **Stagnant Flow** or blockages, revealing structural weaknesses or points of imminent failure.

    excerpt: |
      A system that adopts a gyroidal Ki has found a profound "sweet spot" in the landscape of the Lagrangian. It has woven itself into a form that maximizes its internal coherence (`Kτ`) while expertly navigating and dissipating the external Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). This tool is designed to find that form.

        The divergence of the stress tensor represents the net force per unit volume from stress variations, which aligns conceptually with `∇Γ` identifying "structural weaknesses" and points of failure due to unevenly distributed forces.

        This is a direct mathematical mapping. DOMA-187 explicitly defines `∇Γ` as "The variance of the temporal pressure," making Var(Γ) the correct operational and mathematical analog. It is a scalar measure of field inhomogeneity.

  collisions: [The symbol `∇Γ` directly collides with the standard mathematical "gradient of Γ," which is a vector field. The Pirouette definition is a scalar variance.]
  disambiguation: |
    Note that while the symbol `∇Γ` implies a vector gradient, its operational definition within Pirouette (as of DOMA-187) is the *scalar variance* of the pressure field, `Var(Γ)`. The symbol is used evocatively to represent spatial *variation* and *stress*, not a formal vector derivative. High `∇Γ` signifies high pressure *inhomogeneity*.

# Pressure Gradient

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The spatial variance of **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** across a system's coherence manifold (Ki). A high Pressure Gradient indicates an uneven distribution of external stress, pinpointing structural weaknesses, blockages (**Stagnant Flow**), or regions of imminent failure where the system cannot efficiently dissipate or route pressure. It is a scalar quantity representing the degree of pressure inhomogeneity.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pressure Gradient `∇Γ` is operationally defined as the spatial variance of the Temporal Pressure field `Γ` over a system's manifold, `Var(Γ)`. It is a scalar measure of pressure inhomogeneity, analogous to squared density contrasts `(δρ/ρ)²` in cosmology or fluid dynamics. It is computed from a reconstructed 3D field map to identify regions of high stress that predict structural failure.
