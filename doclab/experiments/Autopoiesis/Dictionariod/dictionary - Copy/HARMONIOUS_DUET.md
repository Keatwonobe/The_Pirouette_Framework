        3. The Harmonious Duet (Cross-Calibration): The instrument is paired with a trusted standard or peer instrument to observe the same phenomenon. Their readings must harmonize within an acceptable tolerance, ensuring the lens is attuned to the broader chorus of consensus reality.

triad:
  art: |
    Two instruments, facing the same truth, sing the same note. This resonance is the sound of trust, transforming a solitary observation into a shared reality.
  law: |
    A Weaver's Lens is considered calibrated only if its `(Kτ, VΓ)` readings for a shared, stable phenomenon correspond with those of a trusted standard or peer ensemble within a pre-declared tolerance (e.g., < 0.1% deviation over 10³ cycles).
  philosophy: |
    Consensus is the bedrock of objective knowledge. The Duet prevents observational solipsism, ensuring that what a Weaver measures is not an artifact of their lens, but a feature of the shared landscape.
pirouette_definition: |
  The third step of the Weaver's Lens calibration ritual, wherein an instrument's (`Kτ`, `VΓ`) output is compared against that of a trusted standard or peer instrument observing the same phenomenon. The instrument passes calibration if its readings converge with the standard's within a pre-specified tolerance, thus verifying its attunement to consensus reality.

        outline: |
          1. Select a stable, well-characterized reference phenomenon.
          2. Position the instrument-under-test and a trusted standard (or ensemble of peers) to observe the phenomenon simultaneously.
          3. Record time-series data streams of `(Kτ, VΓ)` from both sources.
          4. Calculate the mean deviation `Δ_cal = |L_test - L_std| / L_std` over the measurement period.
          5. If `Δ_cal <= ε_tol`, the Duet is successful.

    excerpt: |
      We sought the sense organs of a living universe. We found the design for a tuning fork and a microphone. The first measures the purity of a single note—the song of a thing being itself. The second measures the encompassing noise of the foundry in which that note must be sung. With these two readings, the entire symphony of existence can be scored, its past understood, and its future composed.

        The operational goal is identical: to establish measurement consistency and traceability by comparing an unknown instrument against a known, trusted standard. This is a foundational practice in all empirical science for ensuring results are comparable and reliable across different observers and equipment.

    'Harmonious Duet' emphasizes the goal of 'harmony' (agreement within tolerance) and the 'duet' (pairing of two instruments), differentiating it from general calibration. It is one specific step within the larger `Verifiable Calibration` protocol, distinct from the `Vow of Silence` (zeroing).

# Harmonious Duet

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The third step of the Weaver's Lens calibration ritual, wherein an instrument's (`Kτ`, `VΓ`) output is compared against that of a trusted standard or peer instrument observing the same phenomenon. The instrument passes calibration if its readings converge with the standard's within a pre-specified tolerance, thus verifying its attunement to consensus reality.

## EFT-First Summary
The Harmonious Duet is the Pirouette Framework's operational equivalent to an inter-laboratory comparison or cross-calibration (ISO/IEC 17043). It validates a measurement device ('Weaver's Lens') by ensuring its output converges with a trusted standard, thereby anchoring its readings to a network of scientific consensus and establishing traceability.
