  art: |
    The mathematical echo of a particle's self-interaction, a precise measure of how its path is perturbed by the hum of the temporal background. It is the transfer function between the Temporal Forge's noise and the particle's song.
  law: |
    The loop factor C(m_Γ/m_ℓ) is a dimensionless function, defined by a specific one-loop integral, that dictates the strength of the Pressuron-mediated contribution to a lepton's anomalous magnetic moment (Δa_ℓ). Its value is uniquely determined by the ratio of the Pressuron mass (m_Γ) to the lepton mass (m_ℓ), vanishing as m_Γ → ∞ and approaching a constant 1/(12π) as m_Γ → 0.
  philosophy: |
    The loop factor represents the principle that interactions are not monolithic but are modulated by the energy scales involved. It is the concrete mathematical implementation of scale-dependent coupling, showing how a particle's properties are dynamically shaped by the virtual particles it can emit and reabsorb. Its successful calculation validates the specific QFT dynamics of the Pirouette Framework.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dimensionless function, denoted C, that arises from the one-loop vertex correction integral involving a lepton and a virtual Pressuron. It quantifies the magnitude of the Pressuron-mediated contribution to the lepton's anomalous magnetic moment (Δa_ℓ), representing the function resulting from the one-loop integral that determines the magnitude of the anomaly. The function's value depends on the ratio of the Pressuron mass (m_Γ) to the lepton mass (m_ℓ), and its specific mathematical form is a direct consequence of the Yukawa-type coupling `g_ℓ Γ ψ̄_ℓ ψ_ℓ` in the Pirouette Lagrangian.

          1. Experimentally measure the anomalous magnetic moment `a_ℓ` for a lepton (e.g., muon).
          2. Subtract the known Standard Model prediction `a_ℓ^SM` to find the residual anomaly `Δa_ℓ = a_ℓ - a_ℓ^SM`.
          3. Using the Pirouette formula `Δa_ℓ = (α / 2π) g_ℓ^2 C(m_Γ / m_ℓ)`, and assuming values for the coupling `g_ℓ` and Pressuron mass `m_Γ`, calculate the corresponding value of C that fits the data.
        expected_signals: [A non-zero `Δa_ℓ` consistent across different leptons (electron, muon) according to the mass scaling hypothesis.]
        pitfalls: [Experimental uncertainty in `a_ℓ`, theoretical uncertainty in `a_ℓ^SM`, degeneracy between the parameters `g_ℓ` and `m_Γ` when fitting `Δa_ℓ`.]

    excerpt: |
      The (g-2) shift is read from the Pauli form factor (F₂(0)). The diagram is the standard photon–lepton vertex with a pressuron exchanged on an internal line. Using Feynman rules for (g_ℓ,Γ,ψ̄ψ),
      `Δa_ℓ = F₂(0) = (α/2π) C(m_Γ/m_ℓ) g_ℓ² + O(g_ℓ⁴)`.
      For a light Γ (m_Γ ≪ m_ℓ), the loop factor has the compact limit `C(0) = 1/(12π)`.

      Using (g_ℓ = κ(m_ℓ/m_e)ᵖ),
      `Δa_ℓ = (α/(12π²)) κ² (m_ℓ/m_e)²ᵖ f(m_Γ/m_ℓ), where f(0)=1,`
      where `f ≡ C/C(0)` captures the mass dependence of Γ. For the muon target, `Δa_μ^target ≃ 2.5×10⁻⁹`, this relation fixes the base coupling κ for any given (p, m_Γ).

      justification: |
        In quantum field theory, one-loop calculations for vertex corrections generically produce scalar functions of masses and external momenta, known as loop functions. C is a specific, well-behaved scalar loop function arising from the Pirouette one-loop vertex correction. It is analogous to the finite parts of Passarino–Veltman functions after dimensional regularization.

      confidence: 0.9
  adopted:
    - target: Scalar loop function
      rationale: "The term 'loop factor' is less common in standard QFT literature than 'loop function' or 'form factor', but its role is identical: it is the finite, momentum-dependent scalar function resulting from the evaluation of a loop integral."

  claims:
    - statement: "The function C(m_Γ/m_ℓ) correctly describes the dependence of the lepton anomalous magnetic moment anomaly `Δa_ℓ` on the Pressuron and lepton masses."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Measurements of `Δa_ℓ` for two different leptons (e.g., electron and muon), when combined with the mass scaling hypothesis for `g_ℓ`, are inconsistent with a single choice of `m_Γ`. This would imply the functional form of C is incorrect."

  disambiguation: |
    This C is specifically the Pirouette loop factor, a dimensionless integral function. It is not an operator. Context (anomalous magnetic moment, one-loop diagrams) is essential for disambiguation.
