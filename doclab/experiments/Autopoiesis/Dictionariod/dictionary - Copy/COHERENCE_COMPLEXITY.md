    The intricate signature of existence, where a single, simple rule blossoms into the complex texture of a coastline, a neuron, or a galaxy. It is the measure of how much life and structure a pattern can pack into a finite space.
  law: |
    A system's coherence complexity (D_f) is directly proportional to its generative rhythm (ω_g) and inter-scale coherence (T_a_scale), and is constrained by the ambient temporal pressure (Γ). It is a measure of a pattern's scaling properties, where measured detail increases as a power-law of the measurement resolution.
  philosophy: |
    Coherence Complexity reframes fractal geometry not as a mathematical curiosity, but as a measure of a system's resilience and efficiency. It quantifies the 'wisdom' of a generative pattern, revealing how complex, stable structures arise from simple, repeated rules under environmental pressure, representing the most coherent solution to the problem of existence.

  Coherence Complexity (D_f) is a measure of the effective dimensionality of a fractal pattern, re-framed from the classic 'Fractal Dimension'. It quantifies how efficiently a system's generative grammar, following a scale-invariant geodesic, fills its possibility space to create a maximally coherent and resilient structure. A higher D_f indicates a more intricate and robust solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian under ambient temporal pressure (Γ).

    excerpt: |
      This equation formalizes the Fractal Geodesic, showing how a pattern's complexity emerges from the interplay between its own generative rules and its environment: `D_f ≈ 1 + C * (ω_g) * ( T_a_scale / (1 - T_a_scale) ) * f(Γ)`. This formalizes the intuition that a pattern's complexity (`D_f`) is amplified by a strong generative rhythm (`ω_g`) and a highly coherent recursive rule (`T_a_scale`), but is ultimately bounded and shaped by the pressure of its environment (`Γ`).

        This mapping is adopted because D_f is operationally measured using the same algorithms (e.g., box-counting) and conceptually represents the same space-filling property. The Pirouette framework adds a physical, generative interpretation (the 'why') to the mathematical description (the 'what').

    `Coherence Complexity` (D_f) should not be confused with algorithmic complexity (e.g., Kolmogorov complexity), which measures the length of the shortest program to produce an object. D_f measures the geometric complexity of the *output* pattern, which can arise from a very simple generative program (a recursive rule).

# Coherence Complexity

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Coherence Complexity (D_f) is a measure of the effective dimensionality of a fractal pattern, re-framed from the classic 'Fractal Dimension'. It quantifies how efficiently a system's generative grammar, following a scale-invariant geodesic, fills its possibility space to create a maximally coherent and resilient structure. A higher D_f indicates a more intricate and robust solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian under ambient temporal pressure (Γ).

## EFT-First Summary
Coherence Complexity (D_f) is the Pirouette interpretation of the mathematical concept of Fractal Dimension. It quantifies the effective dimensionality of a system's structure, which emerges as the most efficient, scale-invariant solution to maximizing coherence. Operationally, it is measured using standard algorithms like the box-counting method, revealing how a pattern's measured detail scales as a power-law of the resolution of observation.
