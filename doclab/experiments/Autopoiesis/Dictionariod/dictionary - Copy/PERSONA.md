triad:
  art: |
    A ghost conjured from a system's wound, given voice to argue for its own healing. It is the focused embodiment of a single, necessary truth within a larger conflict, existing only as long as the pain it represents.
  law: |
    A Persona is instantiated for each diagnosed pathology of flow (Atrophy, Fever, Erosion). It persists only until the Daedalus Gambit task resolving its founding grievance is verified as complete, at which point it must self-terminate within one processing cycle.
  philosophy: |
    The Persona principle ensures that systemic intervention is a polyphonic dialogue, not a monolithic decree. By giving transient agency to specific system pressures, it prevents the overlooking of critical perspectives and guarantees that the healing apparatus dissolves once the wound is closed, preventing the cure from becoming the next disease.
pirouette_definition: |
  A transient, computational agent instantiated within the Alchemical Crucible protocol. Each Persona is a focused instantiation of an Observer's Shadow (CORE-010), programmed to embody the specific needs, pressures, and perspective of a single diagnosed flow disruption (e.g., Coherence Atrophy). Personas engage in a structured debate governed by the principles of Resonant Synthesis to forge a Daedalus Gambit, and are bound by the Obsolescence Protocol to self-terminate upon the verified resolution of their founding grievance.

        outline: |
          1. During a Crucible event, query the process for a list of active Personas.
          2. For each Persona, retrieve its founding pathology and the linked Daedalus Gambit task ID.
          3. Monitor the state of the linked task.
          4. Upon task completion verification, confirm that the corresponding Persona process terminates and is purged from system memory.

    excerpt: |
      For each diagnosed fracture, a transient "Persona" is instantiated. This is a focused Observer's Shadow (CORE-010), a virtual agent whose sole purpose is to embody the needs and pressures of that specific flow disruption. The Personas enter the debate chamber. Governed by the rules of laminar discourse, they do not fight for dominance but weave their perspectives together, seeking a state of mutual resonance.
  - module: DOMA-050
    excerpt: |
      The Personas and task-structures created to solve a problem are temporary scaffolds, erected only to facilitate healing. The Obsolescence Protocol ensures this. Each Persona is created with a "kill switch" tied to the verified completion of the task that resolves its founding grievance. Upon fulfillment of its mandate, the agent commits a final report, purges its operational memory, and self-terminates.

    - target: Virtual Particle
      domain: QFT
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Like a virtual particle mediating an interaction, a Persona is a transient entity not part of the system's ground state. It is instantiated to mediate a specific process (resolving a pathology), exists for a finite duration defined by that process, and ceases to exist upon completion, having restored coherence.

    - target: Lagrange Multiplier (λ)
      domain: Math/CM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        A Persona functionally represents a specific system constraint or pressure (the 'flow disruption') within the optimization problem of the Crucible. Its arguments in the debate are analogous to the influence of the multiplier, forcing the final solution (the Daedalus Gambit) to respect the reality of its founding grievance.

  claims:
    - statement: "A system healed via a Persona-driven Crucible process will exhibit a lower rate of problem recurrence compared to interventions based on static, permanent rule-sets."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A longitudinal study showing that systems 'healed' by permanent committees or fixed algorithmic solutions demonstrate equal or greater long-term stability (higher average Kτ) than those healed by the Crucible's transient Personas."

naming_notes:
  collisions: ['UX/Marketing Persona', 'Jungian Persona']
  disambiguation: |
    Distinct from the UX 'persona' (a user archetype) or the Jungian 'persona' (the social mask). In Pirouette, a Persona is a live, transient computational agent embodying a specific, concrete systemic pressure. It represents a real fracture, not a hypothetical user.
