  art: |
    Two numbers make light: the softness of time when you try to twist its clock (related to connection coupling `g`), and the count of windings a particle’s inner clock must make to return to itself (charge unit `q`). Their product is electric charge `e`, the source of all electromagnetic phenomena.
  law: |
    The observable electric charge `e` is the product of the universal clock-synchronization charge unit `q` and the connection coupling `g`. This implies `α = (qg)² / (4πħc)`. Below the coherence barrier `ω_c`, its running follows the standard QED β-function, but it also exhibits a minuscule, negative secular drift (`dα/dt < 0`) due to the cosmological evolution of the Γ-tail.
  philosophy: |
    By decomposing the electromagnetic coupling into components of clock quantization (`q`) and temporal medium stiffness (`g`), Pirouette grounds a fundamental constant of nature in the dynamical geometry of time. This makes `α` not an arbitrary input parameter but a calculable and potentially variable feature of the cosmos, linking particle physics to cosmology.
pirouette_definition: |
  The physical electromagnetic coupling `e` is the emergent charge seen in interactions between matter and the canonically normalized physical photon field `A^(phys)`. It is defined as the product of two more fundamental parameters: the **connection coupling** `g`, which arises from the stiffness of the temporal medium against clock-mismatch curvature and normalizes the Maxwell kinetic term; and the **charge unit** `q`, a universally quantized value arising from the Berry phase of spinor Ki defects' internal clocks. The fine-structure constant is therefore `α ≡ e² / (4πħc) = q²g² / (4πħc)`.

          Infer the value of `e` through its relation to the fine-structure constant `α`, which is measured with high precision from experiments like the quantum Hall effect, the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron (`g-2`), or atom interferometry.

        outline: |
          Compare the spectra of high-redshift quasars (probing `α` in the early universe) with modern laboratory atomic clock measurements. A systematic shift in fine-structure transition lines would indicate a change in `α` (and thus `e`) over cosmic time.
        expected_signals: [A statistically significant trend of `Δα/α` with lookback time, with a sign `Δα > 0` (larger `α` in the past).]
        pitfalls: [Astrophysical systematics, misidentification of spectral lines, insufficient statistical power.]

    excerpt: |
      Under the photon rescaling (`A_μ → A_μ/g`), the matter coupling becomes `q(Ψ̄γ^μA_μΨ) = (qg)(Ψ̄γ^μA^(phys)_μΨ)`. Hence the physical electromagnetic coupling is `e=qg`. `g` measures how “stiff” the temporal ocean is against clock-mismatch curvature; `q` counts how many clock-turns (Berry winding) the Ki defect carries. Their product is the observable charge.
  - module: MATH-QED-004_fine_structure_from_connection_stiffness
    excerpt: |
      Slow evolution of the Γ background perturbs the stiffnesses, leading to a secular drift: `δ α / α = 2(δg/g + δq/q)`. On the Pirouette baseline, the background `⟨Γ²⟩` decreases monotonically from recombination to today, so the sign of `dα/dt` is negative. The predicted magnitude `|α̇/α| ≲ 10⁻¹⁸ yr⁻¹` is well below current bounds but offers a directional, falsifiable prediction.

# Physical Electromagnetic Coupling

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The physical electromagnetic coupling `e` is the emergent charge seen in interactions between matter and the canonically normalized physical photon field `A^(phys)`. It is defined as the product of two more fundamental parameters: the **connection coupling** `g`, which arises from the stiffness of the temporal medium against clock-mismatch curvature and normalizes the Maxwell kinetic term; and the **charge unit** `q`, a universally quantized value arising from the Berry phase of spinor Ki defects' internal clocks. The fine-structure constant is therefore `α ≡ e² / (4πħc) = q²g² / (4πħc)`.

## EFT-First Summary
In standard Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the electric charge `e` is a fundamental constant whose value is determined by experiment. The Pirouette Framework derives `e` as the product `qg`, grounding its value in the stiffness (`g`) and topological winding number (`q`) of a temporal medium. This structure reproduces all standard QED phenomenology at laboratory scales, including the renormalization group running of the coupling. However, it also predicts a minute cosmological drift in `e`'s value, linking the stability of electromagnetism to the evolution of the cosmic Γ background.
