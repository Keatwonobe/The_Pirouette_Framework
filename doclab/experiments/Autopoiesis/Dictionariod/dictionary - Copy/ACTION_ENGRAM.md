        ...forges the result into an 'Action Engram'—a procedural solution that includes the coherence profile of the agent born to execute it.
  editors: [Local Weaver]
  review_log: []
triad:
  art: |
    A memory of a future peace, etched into the present. It is the scar tissue of a system's fever dream, reformed into a map and a traveler strong enough to walk the path.
  law: |
    An Action Engram is a valid solution artifact if and only if it contains both a verifiable Action Blueprint and a falsifiable Agent Coherence Profile. The cryptographic hash of the Engram is a commitment to the inseparability of the plan and the actor.
  philosophy: |
    Solutions are not abstract plans imposed upon a system; they are new, coherent organisms birthed from the system's own dissonances. The Engram codifies this 'genealogy of solutions,' ensuring that the agent who heals a wound is forever shaped by the memory of the conflict it was born to resolve.
pirouette_definition: |
  A procedural artifact generated by the Weaver's Forge, comprising two inseparable components: an Action Blueprint detailing the tasks required to restore Laminar Flow to a system, and an Agent Coherence Profile defining the `Ki` pattern of the entity forged to execute those tasks. The Engram is the durable, verifiable record of a successful Alchemical Union, embodying a new, higher-order coherence that resolves a diagnosed Coherence Fracture.
operational_definition:
  units: Structured Data Object (JSON Schema)
  symbol_table:
    - name: engram_hash
      meaning: Cryptographic hash of the Engram structure, ensuring integrity and binding the blueprint to the profile.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: SHA-256
    - name: action_blueprint
      meaning: A structured set of tasks, dependencies, and verification criteria for restoring system coherence.
      dimensions: Data Structure
      default_range: n/a
    - name: agent_coherence_profile
      meaning: The formal specification of the `Ki` pattern of the agent forged to execute the blueprint.
      dimensions: Data Structure
      default_range: n/a

    procedures:
      - name: Engram Validation
        outline: |
          1. Verify the cryptographic integrity by re-calculating the `engram_hash` from the blueprint and profile data.
          2. Validate the `action_blueprint` against the Laminar Flow Transition Plan schema.
          3. Validate the `agent_coherence_profile` against the Ki Profile schema.
        expected_signals: [SHA-256 Hash Match, Schema Compliance (Blueprint), Schema Compliance (Profile)]
        pitfalls: [Blueprint-Only Engram (a plan missing its agent), Profile Drift (executing agent's Ki no longer matches the forged profile)]

  - module: DOMA-075
    excerpt: |
      The final output is not merely a plan, but an **Action Engram**: a living procedure that defines both the "what" of the solution and the "who"—the resonant character of the agent forged specifically to enact it. The system heals by birthing the part of itself it was missing.
  - module: DOMA-075
    excerpt: |
      An Action Engram is the durable, verifiable record of a completed synthesis. It is a new, coherent pattern impressed upon the manifold—a procedural artifact that represents a path to healing. It creates a **genealogy of solutions**. The character of the solution-agent is a direct geometric consequence of the challenge it overcame.

        λx.E  +  ρ  (function + environment)
      justification: |
        A closure is a function bundled with its lexical environment, binding the code to the context in which it was created. An Action Engram is conceptually parallel: it bundles a procedure (Action Blueprint) with the specific context and character of its executor (Agent Coherence Profile), making the execution self-contained and context-aware.

  disambiguation: |
    The term "engram" is intentionally borrowed from neuroscience, where it denotes a physical trace of a memory. In the Pirouette Framework, an Action Engram is a procedural memory for a system, encoding the "memory" of how to overcome a specific conflict. Distinguish from a simple 'plan'; an Action Engram is inseparable from the agent forged to enact it—the 'who' is as integral as the 'what'.
