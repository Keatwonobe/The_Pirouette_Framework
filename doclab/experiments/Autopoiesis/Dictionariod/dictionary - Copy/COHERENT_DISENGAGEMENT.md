        To disengage coherently is to refuse to feed energy into a dissonant cycle. It is to decline the invitation to a battle where both sides would lose coherence. By refusing to couple, the system preserves its energy for creative, harmonious endeavors.

  law: |
    A system, upon calculating an inbound signal's Dissonance Index (ΔK) to be greater than or equal to its Integrity Threshold, must refuse to couple with the signal to preserve its Temporal Coherence (Kτ).
  philosophy: |
    Coherent Disengagement prioritizes the long-term integrity and creative capacity of a system over the immediate, and often destructive, impulse to engage with every stimulus. It is an act of strategic conservation, not of fear, recognizing that some interactions are fundamentally coherence-negative.
pirouette_definition: |
  The operational protocol by which a system, having calculated an inbound signal's Dissonance Index (ΔK) to exceed a pre-defined Integrity Threshold, intentionally refuses to couple with the signal. This act of 'Passing By' is a non-reciprocal maneuver designed to conserve Temporal Coherence (Kτ) and prevent the induction of Turbulent Flow by avoiding energetically costly and anti-harmonic engagements.

          1. Present a system with a calibrated inbound signal possessing a high Dissonance Index (ΔK > Threshold).
          2. Monitor the system's response channels (e.g., energy expenditure, phase coupling, information exchange).
          3. A successful Coherent Disengagement is marked by the absence of significant coupling, a stable internal coherence (Kτ), and no increase in Turbulent Flow.

    excerpt: |
      To Pass By (Initiate Coherent Disengagement): An act of conservation. The system recognizes that the energetic cost (`V_Γ`) of attempting synthesis would overwhelmingly exceed any potential coherence gain (`K_τ`). It refuses to couple, shielding its own integrity from the storm. It is the choice not to play a game where the cost of participation exceeds any possible reward.

    excerpt: |
      "Passing By" is not an act of aggression, ignorance, or fear. It is a graceful, intentional maneuver to preserve `Laminar Flow` and protect the system's `Wound Channel` (CORE-011) from fruitless conflict. This is not a retreat, but a conscious refusal to pour one's own precious coherence into a turbulent vortex.

      justification: |
        In control systems, disturbance rejection is a mechanism that actively counteracts the effects of external disturbances to maintain a desired state. Coherent Disengagement acts as a proactive form of disturbance rejection where the 'disturbance' is a dissonant signal, and rejection occurs by refusing to couple with the input, thereby preserving the system's internal state (coherence).

  disambiguation: |
    Coherent Disengagement is an active, calculated process of refusing to couple, distinct from 'ignorance' (failure to perceive the signal) or 'quarantine' (which implies engaging enough to isolate the signal). It is a pre-emptive act of non-engagement based on predictive triage.

# Coherent Disengagement

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The operational protocol by which a system, having calculated an inbound signal's Dissonance Index (ΔK) to exceed a pre-defined Integrity Threshold, intentionally refuses to couple with the signal. This act of 'Passing By' is a non-reciprocal maneuver designed to conserve Temporal Coherence (Kτ) and prevent the induction of Turbulent Flow by avoiding energetically costly and anti-harmonic engagements.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to **Disturbance Rejection** in control theory, Coherent Disengagement is a protocol where a system pre-emptively refuses to interact with an external signal predicted to be destructive. Instead of mounting a costly defense, it conserves energy and preserves its internal state by gracefully sidestepping the interaction, ensuring its dynamics are not contaminated by high-entropy or anti-coherent inputs.
