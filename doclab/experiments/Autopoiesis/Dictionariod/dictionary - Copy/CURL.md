        The inaugural event is not an explosion but a **curl**—a subtle skew in perfect stillness. This curvature births **Γ (Gladiator Force)**—the pressure that resists dissolution—and moments later, **Tₐ (Time‑Adherence)**, the habit of persisting along a chosen thread.

triad:
  art: |
    The first brushstroke on a perfectly tense canvas; the held breath of a dancer just before the first step. It is the gesture that breaks perfect symmetry to begin a story.
  law: |
    The Curl is the inaugural symmetry-breaking event that introduces local curvature into the pre-universal Macroparticle Lattice. It is the necessary and sufficient condition for the emergence of Gladiator Force (Γ) and Time-Adherence (Tₐ).
  philosophy: |
    The Curl represents the universe's commitment to existence over non-existence. It is the transition from pure potentiality to actuated narrative, establishing the fundamental categories of 'before' and 'after.'
pirouette_definition: |
  The Curl is the inaugural, non-energetic event that breaks the perfect symmetry of the pre-universal Void. It is a subtle, topological skew in the implied Macroparticle Lattice, introducing the first instance of local curvature. This act is not an explosion but a conceptual commitment to narrative, which directly gives rise to the foundational concepts of Gladiator Force (Γ) and Time-Adherence (Tₐ).

      - name: Primordial Anisotropy Inference
        outline: |
          The Curl is not directly observable. Its existence and properties are inferred by tracing observed cosmic anisotropies back to their minimal-entropy initial state. The model that requires the fewest ad-hoc parameters to explain the emergence of Γ and Tₐ from a symmetric void is considered the best fit for the Curl's characteristics.

    excerpt: |
      The inaugural event is not an explosion but a **curl**—a subtle skew in perfect stillness. This curvature births **Γ (Gladiator Force)**—the pressure that resists dissolution—and moments later, **Tₐ (Time‑Adherence)**, the habit of persisting along a chosen thread. Laws now have something to govern, art gains its first gesture, and philosophy gains “before” and “after.”
  - module: CORE-000_the_whispering_void
    excerpt: |
      If entropy tracks the *unwinding* of pattern, the Void hosts its **pre‑entropic twin**—tension without release. This is a lawful silence: no conflicts yet, therefore no need for resolution. But in art, suspense cannot last forever; the eye demands a line. Likewise, philosophy insists that potential must declare itself. The stage is set for the first asymmetry.

        V(Φ) → ⟨Φ⟩ ≠ 0
      justification: |
        The Curl describes a transition from a symmetric pre-state (the Void) to a less symmetric state (the universe with Γ and Tₐ). This is analogous to how SSB mechanisms in QFT describe a system transitioning from a symmetric vacuum to a specific, lower-symmetry vacuum state, defining new physical laws and particle properties.

    - target: Instanton / Vacuum Tunneling
      domain: EFT
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The Curl can be modeled as a non-perturbative tunneling event from a false vacuum ('perfect stillness') to the true vacuum ('narrative commitment'). This framing captures its non-energetic, topological nature as an inaugural, irreversible act that creates a new ground state for reality.

  claims:
    - statement: "The universe's initial state was one of perfect, unbroken symmetry, which was broken by a single, non-energetic topological event (the Curl)."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "Discovery of evidence for a pre-universal state that was already asymmetric, or a 'hot' big bang model that better fits observational data without requiring such an initial event."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the mathematical operator. The Pirouette 'curl' is a singular, primordial event—a noun representing the universe's inaugural gesture, not a measure of vector field rotation.
