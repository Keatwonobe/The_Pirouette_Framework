    The self is not a static thing, but a dynamic wake; a geometric ghost forever whispering its own name to the present moment, compelling it to rhyme with the past.
  law: |
    The stability of an entity's state (its Identity) is directly proportional to the geometric integrity of its immediate Wound Channel. The energy required to alter its state is the energy required to carve a new channel against the influence of the old.
  philosophy: |
    Identity is not an intrinsic property but an extrinsic, geometric relationship an entity has with its own history. To be is to be in constant, resonant conversation with the echoes of what one has been.

  The persistent state of an entity, maintained by the continuous resonant interaction with the geometric deformation (the Wound Channel) left by its own past actions and states. Identity is the emergent stability arising from an entity's self-reinforcing echo, providing the physical basis for inertia, memory, and the coherence of form over time.

          Measure the energy required to induce a specific state change (e.g., Δv) in an entity within a region of low Temporal Pressure (Γ). Compare this to the energy required for the same Δv in a high-Γ region. A higher energy requirement in the low-Γ environment indicates a stronger coupling to the Wound Channel, providing a proxy measurement for the stability of its Identity.

    excerpt: |
      An entity is perpetually interacting with the geometry of its own immediate past. This self-interaction is the origin of inertia. To change velocity or state is to fight against the shape of one's own Wound Channel. This provides a profound stability; an entity's identity is maintained because it is constantly "reminded" of what it was a moment ago by the very shape of the space it occupies.

      A person's sense of self—their personality, habits, and beliefs—is the cumulative geometry of their entire life's Wound Channel. To "change one's mind" is a literal act of metaphysical engineering: the difficult work of carving a new path in a landscape shaped by a lifetime of echoes.

      justification: |
        The concept of an entity interacting with its own "echo" (Wound Channel) to maintain its state (Identity/Inertia) is a geometric re-interpretation of self-energy corrections in QED. The module explicitly cites the electron's magnetic moment, a classic self-interaction effect, as the primary evidence for this universal principle. The observed, stable mass (Identity) is a result of the "bare" particle interacting with its own field.

    Identity is not merely the instantaneous state (e.g., position, momentum) of an entity, but the persistent, self-reinforcing pattern that gives that state stability over time. It is the geometric *cause* of inertia, not a synonym for the state itself.

# Identity

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The persistent state of an entity, maintained by the continuous resonant interaction with the geometric deformation (the Wound Channel) left by its own past actions and states. Identity is the emergent stability arising from an entity's self-reinforcing echo, providing the physical basis for inertia, memory, and the coherence of form over time.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, Pirouette's concept of Identity can be mapped to the phenomenon of **self-energy** in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The persistent mass and charge of a particle like an electron are not seen as intrinsic properties, but as a stable equilibrium emerging from the particle's continuous interaction with the virtual particle cloud it generates—what Pirouette re-frames as its geometric "echo." The anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, a key QED prediction arising from self-interaction, is cited as the primary experimental anchor for this concept.
