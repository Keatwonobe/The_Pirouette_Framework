  art: |
    A faint, residual warmth from the Γ field's energetic awakening. This afterglow subtly alters the tempo of the early universe's expansion, leaving an indelible signature on the first light and the first atoms.
  law: |
    Within the Γ-unification model, ΔN_eff is not a free parameter but a derived prediction constrained by the field potential V(Γ) and the one-shot anchor. The predicted value must remain consistent with primordial light-element abundances (BBN) and CMB acoustic peak damping (e.g., Planck constraints), or the underlying model is falsified.
  philosophy: |
    ΔN_eff serves as a crucial falsification hook, translating the abstract microphysics of the Γ field's early dynamics into a concrete, measurable number. It ensures the model remains tethered to empirical cosmic history, bridging the gap between theoretical elegance and observational reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  A parameter quantifying the residual relativistic energy density contributed by the Pressuron (Γ) field during the radiation-dominated era, particularly affecting Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) acoustic peaks. Within the Pirouette Framework, ΔN_eff is not a tunable parameter but a *prediction* derived from the dynamics of the Γ field as it transitions from a frozen, vacuum-like state to its oscillatory, matter-like phase. Its value is determined by the field's potential V(Γ) and initial conditions set by the one-shot anchor.

      - name: BBN Primordial Abundance Inference
        outline: |
          1. Measure the primordial abundances of light elements, primarily Deuterium (D/H) and Helium-4 (Y_p), from pristine astrophysical environments (e.g., quasar absorption systems, metal-poor HII regions).
          2. Run a standard BBN code (e.g., PArthENoPE) with the measured baryon-to-photon ratio η.
          3. Vary ΔN_eff in the code, which alters the cosmic expansion rate H(t) during nucleosynthesis, and find the value that best reproduces the observed D/H and Y_p.
        expected_signals: [Increased Y_p abundance relative to the Standard Model prediction (ΔN_eff = 0).]
        pitfalls: [Systematic errors in astrophysical abundance measurements, degeneracy with baryon density η.]
      - name: CMB Anisotropy Power Spectrum Analysis
        outline: |
          1. Measure the CMB temperature (TT), polarization (EE, TE), and lensing power spectra with high precision (e.g., via Planck, ACT, SPT, or future CMB-S4).
          2. Fit a cosmological model using a Boltzmann code (e.g., CLASS, CAMB) to the measured spectra.
          3. ΔN_eff is a parameter in the fit; its primary effect is on the damping of the acoustic peaks at high multipoles (l) and the phase shift of the peaks, as it alters the radiation density and thus the epoch of matter-radiation equality and the sound horizon scale.
        expected_signals: [Enhanced Silk damping, phase shift in acoustic peaks.]
        pitfalls: [Strong degeneracy with other cosmological parameters, especially the Hubble constant H_0 and the matter density Ω_m.]

      Effective dark radiation: small residual relativistic pressure can appear from perturbative mode-mixing before full averaging; we parameterize this as a prior on ΔN_eff and constrain it with BBN+CMB. Prediction (baseline): ΔN_eff in this minimal misalignment picture is small and positive, (ΔN_eff ≲ 0.3), with exact value fixed by the one-shot anchor in COSMO-Γ-000 and the choice of (V(Γ)) tail.

      BBN conflict: If any allowed (V(Γ)) tail + one-shot freeze demands ΔN_eff beyond current BBN constraints, reject the misalignment baseline.

      justification: |
        The symbol ΔN_eff represents the deviation from the Standard Model expectation, N_eff,SM ≈ 3.044. It parameterizes any additional relativistic energy density (ρ_extra) as if it were composed of new neutrino species: ρ_extra = ΔN_eff * ρ_ν,1, where ρ_ν,1 is the energy density of a single massless neutrino species. This is the standard definition used in cosmological data analysis.

      falsifier: "A joint BBN+CMB analysis yielding a constraint that excludes the model's predicted range for any valid, frozen choice of potential V(Γ). For example, a future constraint of ΔN_eff = -0.05 ± 0.08 would falsify the baseline model."

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike in many phenomenological models where ΔN_eff is treated as an independent, free parameter to be fitted, within the Pirouette Framework it is a *derived quantity*. Its value is a direct, testable consequence of the fundamental Γ-field potential and its evolution, as fixed by the one-shot anchor. It serves as an output of the theory, not an input.
