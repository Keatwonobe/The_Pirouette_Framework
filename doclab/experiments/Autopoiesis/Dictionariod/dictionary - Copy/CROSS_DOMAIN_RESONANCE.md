        When coupling multiple coherence fields (\psi_i) across domains:
        [\mathcal{F}*{multi} = \sum_i \mathcal{F}[\psi_i] - \sum*{i<j} g_{ij}|\psi_i||\psi_j|\cos(\Phi_i - \Phi_j)]

        The coupling coefficients (g_{ij}) define cross-domain resonance strength.

    Like sympathetic strings on a viola d'amore, a vibration in one domain—be it mind, matter, or society—excites a corresponding hum in another. Cross-domain resonance is the measure of this shared music, the physics of the unheard chord connecting disparate realities.
  law: |
    The cross-domain resonance `g_ij` is a coefficient in the Landau–Pirouette Functional that quantifies the energy reduction per unit of phase-aligned coherence between two distinct fields, `ψ_i` and `ψ_j`. A non-zero, invariant `g_ij` is a necessary condition for the Pirouette universality class to hold across these domains; if `g_ij` is contextual or zero, the domains are decoupled.
  philosophy: |
    The existence of a non-zero `g_ij` implies a deep, non-local entanglement between seemingly disparate systems, from neural fields to social movements. It posits that the grammar of phase transitions is universal, suggesting a fundamental unity and inter-causality between the physical, cognitive, and social substrates of reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  Cross-Domain Resonance, `g_ij`, is a dimensionless coupling coefficient in the multi-field Landau–Pirouette Functional (`F_multi`) that quantifies the interaction strength between two coherence fields, `ψ_i` and `ψ_j`, operating in different domains (e.g., physical, cognitive, social). It scales the energy reduction gained when the fields align their phases (`cos(Φ_i - Φ_j)`), thereby governing the tendency of a phase transition in one domain to trigger or influence a transition in another. The invariance of `g_ij` across a transformation is a key condition for the Pirouette universality class.

        outline: |
          1. Identify two distinct but potentially coupled systems, `i` and `j`, described by order parameters `ψ_i` and `ψ_j`.
          2. Drive system `i` through a phase transition by tuning its control parameter (e.g., cognitive load `Γ` or curl `Θ`).
          3. Simultaneously measure the susceptibility `χ_P` of system `j` to this transition near the critical point of `i`.
          4. Fit the observed response of `ψ_j` to the coupled Landau-Pirouette Functional, extracting `g_ij` as the best-fit coupling parameter.

    excerpt: |
      When coupling multiple coherence fields (\psi_i) across domains...The coupling coefficients (g_{ij}) define cross-domain resonance strength. Stable multi-domain coherence requires this cross-field conservation, generalizing Noether–Pirouette into a multi-domain entangled law.
  - module: MATH-025
    excerpt: |
      Falsifiability and Predictive Criteria: ...If cross-domain coupling fails (no g_ij invariance), universality breaks down. This would indicate that the observed phase transitions in different domains, while perhaps superficially similar, do not belong to the Pirouette universality class and are not governed by a shared resonance law.

      justification: |
        In statistical field theory, `g_ij` is directly analogous to a coupling constant that mediates the interaction between two distinct fields. The term `-g_ij|ψ_i||ψ_j|cos(ΔΦ)` in the free energy functional is a potential energy term minimized when the fields' phases align, mathematically parallel to interactions in multi-component Ginzburg-Landau models or coupled XY models.

    - target: Coupling constant in a multi-field Ginzburg-Landau theory.
      rationale: "The mapping is a direct mathematical isomorphism. The Landau-Pirouette Functional is explicitly constructed as an extension of the Ginzburg-Landau formalism, making the interpretation of `g_ij` as a coupling constant standard and unambiguous."

  claims:
    - statement: "The coupling coefficient `g_ij` between a specified pair of cognitive and social domains is a constant, invariant under changes in control parameters far from the critical point."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Experimental observation shows that `g_ij` varies significantly with control parameters (e.g., `Γ` or `Θ`), indicating that the coupling is not fundamental but an emergent property, breaking the assumed universality."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [`g` is often used for the metric tensor in GR or for coupling constants in particle physics (e.g., `g_s`). The subscript `ij` clarifies its role as a matrix-like coefficient between fields `i` and `j`.]
  disambiguation: |
    Cross-Domain Resonance (`g_ij`) must be distinguished from the coherence order parameter `ψ` itself. `g_ij` is a static parameter defining the strength of potential interaction, whereas `ψ` is the dynamic field variable that undergoes the phase transition.
