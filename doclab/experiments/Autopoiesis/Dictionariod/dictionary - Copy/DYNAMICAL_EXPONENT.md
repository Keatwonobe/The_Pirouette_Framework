  art: |
    Time's stride, measured against space's yardstick. It sets the system's intrinsic tempo, distinguishing the frantic dance of waves from the slow crawl of diffusion.
  law: |
    Under a rescaling of space by a factor λ (x → λx), time must rescale by λ^z (t → λ^z t) to preserve the form of the system's equations of motion. For nonrelativistic superfluids, z=2 is fixed by Galilean symmetry.
  philosophy: |
    The dynamical exponent is the gear that couples a system's temporal evolution to its spatial structure. It asserts that not all dynamics are created equal; the 'clock' of a system can run at a different rate relative to its 'ruler,' a fundamental asymmetry that shapes everything from wave propagation to emergent thermodynamic laws.
pirouette_definition: |
  The dynamical exponent, z, is a dimensionless real number that quantifies the anisotropic scaling between time and space required to keep the system's dynamics invariant. Under a spatial rescaling `x → λx`, time must rescale as `t → λ^z t`. In the Pirouette Framework, `z` is a fundamental parameter of the superfluid sector, fixed by the underlying kinematics (e.g., `z=2` for nonrelativistic, Galilean-invariant hydrodynamics). It directly relates the effective spatial dimension `D_eff` of the coherence network to the pressure-law exponent `β` via the Ward-identity–like relation `β = D_eff / z`.

        outline: |
          Measure the frequency (ω) versus wavevector (k) for a system's fundamental modes (e.g., sound waves, phonons). Fit the dispersion relation to the power law ω ∝ k^z. The exponent of the fit is z.
        expected_signals: [A power-law relationship between frequency and wavevector of collective excitations. For the Pirouette superfluid, a quadratic relation (ω ∝ k²) is expected, implying z=2.]
        pitfalls: [System must be in a scale-invariant regime to yield a clean power law. Crossover effects or multiple interacting modes can contaminate the fit.]

    excerpt: |
      β = D_eff / z
      where D_eff is the **effective (possibly fractal) spatial dimension** of the active coherence network (wound channels) and z is the dynamical exponent of the superfluid sector. In 3D spacetime with nonrelativistic superfluid scaling z=2 and plateaus D_eff∈{0,1,2}, one obtains β∈{0, 1/2, 1}—exactly the rational set allowed in SECT‑Γ‑A.

      Interpretation
      • z encodes dynamics (e.g., z=2 for superfluid hydrodynamics).
      • D_eff encodes geometry/topology (sheet‑like D_eff≈2; filamentary D_eff≈1; point‑like cores D_eff≈0).

      justification: |
        The Pirouette dynamical exponent 'z' is mathematically identical to the dynamical critical exponent in condensed matter systems exhibiting anisotropic (Lifshitz) scaling. It relates the scaling of correlation time (`ξ_t`) to correlation length (`ξ_x`). The value z=2 is characteristic of non-relativistic, propagating modes (Model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification).

  adopted:
    - target: Dynamical critical exponent z
      rationale: The definition, physical role, and mathematical application (anisotropic time-space scaling) are identical to the well-established concept in the theory of critical phenomena. The choice z=2 for the superfluid sector aligns with standard models of non-relativistic hydrodynamics.

  claims:
    - statement: "In the Pirouette superfluid sector, the dynamical exponent is fixed to z=2 due to the underlying nonrelativistic, Galilean-invariant kinematics."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "Discovery of phenomena within the superfluid sector that are only explainable by a dispersion relation ω ∝ k^z with z ≠ 2, or a fundamental violation of Galilean invariance in the effective theory."
      status: proposed
      links: [MATH-022]
    - statement: "The observed rational plateaus of the Pressuron exponent β={0, 1/2, 1} are a direct consequence of combining a fixed dynamical exponent z=2 with discrete, integer-valued effective dimensions D_eff={0, 1, 2}."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "If observations robustly require a value of β (e.g., β=3/4) that cannot be formed by the ratio of an integer D_eff and z=2, this composite claim would be falsified."

  collisions: [z as a spatial coordinate, z for redshift in cosmology, z for complex numbers]
  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, `z` is almost always the dimensionless dynamical exponent, not a spatial coordinate or redshift, unless explicitly defined otherwise in a local context. It appears in scaling relations like `t → λ^z t` and in the key formula `β = D_eff / z`.
