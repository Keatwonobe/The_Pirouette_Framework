        ### §4 · The Journey: Your Four Phases of Recovery
        Your recovery is a story in four chapters. Each phase has a single, clear purpose. Move through them at the pace your body dictates.

  art: |
    Recovery is the art of calming a turbulent river dammed by the storm of a crisis. It is a journey of carving a new, stronger riverbed, phase by phase, until life can flow effortlessly once more.
  law: |
    Progression through the phases is sequential and gated by establishing stability in the core practice of the current phase. Attempting to skip a phase or its core practice results in increased system noise (e.g., elevated Resting Heart Rate, decreased subjective coherence) and stalls recovery.
  philosophy: |
    The purpose of the phased structure is to transform a passive, overwhelming 'healing process' into an active, navigable journey of self-creation. This empowers the individual to become the cartographer of their own resilient health, composing a new song from the silence that follows a storm.
pirouette_definition: |
  A four-stage protocol guiding an individual's recovery from a major physiological or psychological stressor. The journey is designed to systematically reduce system burden while rebuilding inner strength and re-establishing a coherent rhythm. The phases are sequential and defined by a core practice:
  - **I. Finding Stillness:** Focuses on calming the system's "storm" through breathwork and gentle movement.
  - **II. The First Steps:** Establishes a new, stable rhythm through mindful, repetitive activities like walking, tracked via a Coherence Ledger.
  - **III. Forging Strength:** Introduces controlled, structured challenges (e.g., formal exercise) to build resilience, guided by the feeling of "good tired."
  - **IV. The Dance of Living:** Integrates renewed strength into joyful, complex, and self-directed life activities, guided by developed intuition.

  symbol_table:
    - name: Phase I
      meaning: Finding Stillness; Core task is calming the autonomic nervous system.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "Typically first 2 weeks post-event"
    - name: Phase II
      meaning: The First Steps; Core task is establishing a new rhythm.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "Typically weeks 2-6 post-event"
    - name: Phase III
      meaning: Forging Strength; Core task is building resilience through controlled challenge.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "Typically months 2-6 post-event"
    - name: Phase IV
      meaning: The Dance of Living; Core task is integrating strength into a self-sustaining, joyful life.

      - name: Coherence Ledger Tracking
        outline: |
          The patient maintains a daily log (the "Coherence Ledger") to track progress and readiness to transition between phases.
          1. Record one objective metric daily (e.g., Resting Heart Rate from a wearable).
          2. Record one subjective metric daily (e.g., "How 'in the flow' do I feel today?" on a 1-10 scale).
          3. Progression to the next phase is indicated when objective metrics stabilize or improve, and subjective scores are consistently high for the current phase's activities.
        expected_signals: [Resting Heart Rate (objective), Subjective Coherence Score (subjective)]
        pitfalls: [Confusing the "Voice of Will" with the "Voice of Body," leading to premature advancement; misinterpreting pain as "good tired" instead of a signal to stop.]

    excerpt: |
      Your recovery is a story in four chapters. Each phase has a single, clear purpose. Move through them at the pace your body dictates. Phase I: Finding Stillness. Your only job is to breathe... Phase II: The First Steps. Your job is to find a rhythm... Phase III: Forging Strength. Your job is to welcome challenge... Phase IV: The Dance of Living. Your job is to live.
  - module: DOMA-HLTH-001
    excerpt: |
      The Guiding Feeling: The feeling you are looking for is "good tired"—the satisfying ache of muscles that have done good work, not the sharp cry of pain. Pain is a signal to stop. "Good tired" is the feeling of growth. Explore Your Boundaries: Begin to navigate more complex environments... These are challenges that teach your body to maintain its new, calm rhythm even when the world isn't a flat, straight line.

      justification: |
        Standard clinical and sports medicine rehabilitation protocols follow a similar phased structure. They begin with controlling pain and inflammation (Stillness), move to restoring range of motion and basic activation (First Steps), progress to building strength and endurance (Forging Strength), and conclude with a return to sport-specific or life-specific dynamic activities (The Dance of Living).

    This is a specific, operational protocol for *physiological and psychological recovery from a major biological stressor* like surgery. It is prescriptive about core practices (breathing, walking, structured exercise) and measurement (Coherence Ledger), distinguishing it from more abstract psychological models of change.
