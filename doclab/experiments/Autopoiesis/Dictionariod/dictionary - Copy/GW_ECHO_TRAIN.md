    A faint, repeating whisper from the black hole's core, where the final plunge of spacetime reflects off a crystalline boundary. These ghostly aftershocks in the gravitational wave signal carry an imprint of the structure that replaced the singularity.
  law: |
    A series of damped, repeating gravitational wave packets following the main ringdown signal, with a fixed time spacing \(\Delta t\) determined by the light travel time between the photon sphere and the core boundary \(r_\ast\), and an amplitude suppressed by the core's low reflectivity \(\mathcal{R} \ll 1\). The signal contains only standard tensor (TT) polarizations.
  philosophy: |
    The echo train is a falsifiable signal that the black hole interior is not a singularity but a physical, reflective surface. Its detection would provide a direct measurement of the location and properties of the post-GR core, transforming the event horizon from an absolute veil into a semi-transparent membrane.

  A train of low-amplitude, repeating gravitational wave signals predicted to follow the primary ringdown of a black hole merger. The echoes are generated by the partial reflection of trapped gravitational waves off the stiff boundary (\(r_\ast\)) of a Γ-Saturated "Planck Crystal" core. The echoes exclusively contain the standard tensor polarizations (TT-modes), and their temporal spacing, \(\Delta t\), is set by the wave's round-trip travel time between the core and the exterior potential barrier near the photon sphere.

        The GW Echo Train is the Pirouette-specific realization of the general phenomenological concept of gravitational wave echoes from exotic compact objects (ECOs). Both describe repeating signals caused by reflection from a boundary near the would-be horizon. The Pirouette model makes specific, falsifiable predictions: the echoes are low-amplitude and contain only TT-polarized waves, distinguishing it from broader ECO models.

    The GW Echo Train is a series of discrete, repeating wave packets caused by *reflection*. This is distinct from the "Ringdown phase drift" (also described in DYNA-BH-INT-001), which is a continuous, frequency-dependent dephasing caused by dispersive *propagation* through the core.

# GW Echo Train

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A train of low-amplitude, repeating gravitational wave signals predicted to follow the primary ringdown of a black hole merger. The echoes are generated by the partial reflection of trapped gravitational waves off the stiff boundary (\(r_\ast\)) of a Γ-Saturated "Planck Crystal" core. The echoes exclusively contain the standard tensor polarizations (TT-modes), and their temporal spacing, \(\Delta t\), is set by the wave's round-trip travel time between the core and the exterior potential barrier near the photon sphere.

## EFT-First Summary
The GW Echo Train is the Pirouette Framework's specific, falsifiable implementation of the broader phenomenological concept of "gravitational wave echoes" from exotic compact objects. It posits that a stiff, singularity-resolving core acts as a partially reflective boundary just inside the event horizon. This leads to a series of faint, regularly-spaced repetitions of the main ringdown waveform, offering a direct probe of physics at the black hole's central boundary. The model's key constraints are that these echoes must have very low amplitude and contain only standard tensor-polarized gravitational waves, distinguishing them from more speculative models.
