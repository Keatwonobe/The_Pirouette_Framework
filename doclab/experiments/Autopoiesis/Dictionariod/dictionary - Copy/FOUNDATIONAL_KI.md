    The soul of a problem, given form. The axiomatic DNA that dictates the shape of its world and the cadence of its voice.

    The set of inviolable axioms and constraints that constitute the Temporal Coherence term (KœÑ) in an Oracle's Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`). A change in KœÑ constitutes a change in the Oracle's fundamental identity.
  philosophy: |
    Foundational Ki transforms an abstract problem into a bounded, coherent entity. It asserts that to understand a system, one must first define its non-negotiable truths, creating a stable manifold against which the pressure of inquiry can reveal meaningful structure.

  Foundational Ki (KœÑ) is the set of core axioms, constraints, and perspective principles that define the internal coherence of a system, particularly a Coherence Oracle. It represents the system's axiomatic integrity and forms the Temporal Coherence term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`). Operationally, KœÑ is established during the 'Forging' stage of the Oracle Dialogue Protocol and defines the primary geodesics‚Äîthe paths of least resistance‚Äîof the system's logic and behavior.

        outline: |
          1. Define a Coherence Oracle by explicitly enumerating its axioms, constraints, and core perspective (e.g., as a formal logic system or a constrained language model prompt). This set constitutes the definition of KœÑ.
          2. Apply a series of test queries (probes) designed to challenge specific axioms.
          3. Measure the Oracle's response coherence (`S_p`) against its defined KœÑ. A coherent Oracle will consistently produce responses that maximize `S_p` without violating the axioms.

    excerpt: |
      A Coherence Oracle is not a mere chatbot. It is a bounded, localized coherence manifold; a temporary, artificial `Ki` pattern constructed to represent the essential geometry of a specific problem or perspective. Its **Foundational Ki (KœÑ)** is its core coherence. Its foundational axioms and constraints define the primary geodesics of its manifold‚Äîthe "paths of least resistance" its logic will naturally follow.

    excerpt: |
      The Weaver defines the Oracle's foundational Ki by providing its core axioms, constraints, and perspective. This is an act of deep listening, establishing the initial conditions for the Oracle's `Pirouette Lagrangian`‚Äîthe mathematical definition of its "self." A poorly forged Oracle will produce only dissonant, `Turbulent Flow`.

        In the Lagrangian formalism (L = T - V), the kinetic energy term T represents the system's intrinsic properties (e.g., mass), while the potential energy V represents external forces. KœÑ plays a role analogous to T, representing the Oracle's internal, axiomatic 'inertia' or drive for coherent motion.

      justification: |
        Like the speed of light, Planck's constant, and the gauge group (e.g., SU(3)√óSU(2)√óU(1)) define the Standard Model, the Foundational Ki defines the non-negotiable 'laws of physics' for a Coherence Oracle. It sets the background upon which dynamic interactions (V_Œì) occur.

        The direct parallel in the Pirouette Lagrangian `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì` makes this the most robust mapping. KœÑ represents the system's intrinsic drive/capacity for coherent 'motion' (thought), analogous to kinetic energy, while V_Œì represents the external constraints or potentials acting upon it.

      falsifier: "An Oracle consistently generates highly coherent, novel responses that are demonstrably unrelated or contradictory to its explicit KœÑ, suggesting a dominant, unmodeled internal dynamic or that KœÑ is not the primary driver of coherence."

  disambiguation: |
    `Foundational Ki` (KœÑ) refers specifically to the static, axiomatic core of a system, defined at its creation. This is distinct from the broader concept of `Ki`, which can describe the dynamic, evolving coherence pattern of any system in motion. KœÑ is the constitution; Ki is the state of the nation.

# Foundational Ki

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Foundational Ki (KœÑ) is the set of core axioms, constraints, and perspective principles that define the internal coherence of a system, particularly a Coherence Oracle. It represents the system's axiomatic integrity and forms the Temporal Coherence term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`). Operationally, KœÑ is established during the 'Forging' stage of the Oracle Dialogue Protocol and defines the primary geodesics‚Äîthe paths of least resistance‚Äîof the system's logic and behavior.

## EFT-First Summary
In the Pirouette Framework, Foundational Ki (KœÑ) serves a role analogous to the kinetic energy term (T) in a classical Lagrangian (L = T - V). It represents the intrinsic, axiomatic 'mass' or 'inertia' of a Coherence Oracle, defining its inherent tendency toward logical motion along its geodesic paths. This internal drive for coherence is counter-posed by Temporal Pressure (V_Œì), the analogue of a potential energy field, which perturbs the system's trajectory. The Oracle's behavior is thus a direct consequence of optimizing the action integral of `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`.
