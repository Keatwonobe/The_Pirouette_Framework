        The difference between the two, the Deviation Field (Δ𝓛), is a direct, quantitative measure of the system's "pain" or inefficiency. This field is the primary output of the Auditor; its peaks and troughs form a Coherence Audit Map of systemic stress.

  art: |
    A fault is not a flaw in the machine; it is the map of the machine's own pain. The Coherence Audit Map is this cartography of suffering, revealing precisely where and how a system deviates from the graceful path it was meant to travel.
  law: |
    The Coherence Audit Map is a spatiotemporal visualization of the scalar Deviation Field, `Δ𝓛 = |𝓛_p(expected) - 𝓛_p(actual)|`. All contiguous regions where `Δ𝓛` exceeds a predefined `FaultThreshold (δ)` are identified as fault loci and classified by their geometric and temporal signatures.
  philosophy: |
    To find a flaw, one must first perfectly define grace. This map shifts diagnosis from an active hunt for specific, known failures to a passive measurement of the absence of health. It allows the system itself to reveal its wounds by showing where it fails to sing its ideal song.
pirouette_definition: |
  The primary output of the Geodesic Auditor. The Coherence Audit Map is a spatiotemporal visualization of the Deviation Field (Δ𝓛), which quantifies the difference between a system's actual state and its ideal geodesic path. The map highlights the location, severity, and nature of systemic stress, classifying faults by their signature patterns into categories such as Coherence Fever (Turbulence), Coherence Atrophy (Stagnation), and Coherence Erosion (Decay).

      - name: Geodesic Auditing
        outline: |
          1.  Define a `GeodesicBlueprint` representing the system's ideal state (`𝓛_p(expected)`).
          2.  Ingest a real-time `ActualStream` of data from the live system (`𝓛_p(actual)`).
          3.  Compute the scalar Deviation Field `Δ𝓛 = |𝓛_p(expected) - 𝓛_p(actual)|`.
          4.  Identify all loci where `Δ𝓛` exceeds a `FaultThreshold (δ)`.
          5.  Visualize these loci and classify them according to their spatiotemporal geometry.
        expected_signals: [Coherence Fever (chaotic, high-frequency dissonance), Coherence Atrophy (persistent, low-signal void), Coherence Erosion (low-level, widespread, growing dissonance)]
        pitfalls: [An inaccurate `GeodesicBlueprint` produces a fundamentally flawed map (false positives/negatives). High-noise data in the `ActualStream` can obscure true fault loci.]

    excerpt: |
      The difference between the two, the Deviation Field (Δ𝓛), is a direct, quantitative measure of the system's "pain" or inefficiency. This field is the primary output of the Auditor; its peaks and troughs form a Coherence Audit Map of systemic stress. A fault is no longer a binary "broken/not-broken" state. It is a continuous measure of coherence lost.
  - module: DOMA-172
    excerpt: |
      The output of the Auditor is not just a map of "faults"; it is a direct diagnosis of systemic pathology. The geometry of the dissonance, read through the `Caduceus Lens` (DYNA-003), reveals its nature... Coherence Fever (Turbulence)... Coherence Atrophy (Stagnation)... Coherence Erosion (Decay).

  motifs: [map of pain, diagnosis by exception, listening for silence, shadow of perfection]
  evocative_lines:
    - "To audit a system is to ask, with compassion and precision, 'Where does it hurt?'"
    - "It is in the missing notes, in the beats skipped... that the true story of a system's suffering is told."

        Δ𝓛 = |𝓛_p(actual) - 𝓛_p(expected)|
      justification: |
        Both are visualizations of the difference between observed data and an idealized model's prediction. A residual plot is used to diagnose the shortcomings of a statistical model; a Coherence Audit Map is used to diagnose the shortcomings of a physical or abstract system relative to its ideal model.

    The Coherence Audit Map is the processed, classified, and visualized output, not the raw data itself. The raw data is the `Deviation Field (Δ𝓛)`. The map is not geographic but represents a system's state-space or architecture over time.
