  art: |
    Reality is a river of Time, whose eddies and currents, when viewed through a certain lens, project the illusion of a static, spatial landscape. All structure and substance are but patterns in this single, fundamental flow.
  law: |
    There exists a spatialization map (the SM-CG) that projects the dynamics on the Time Substrate to the Standard Model Lagrangian on a Lorentzian manifold in the high-coherence, high-density limit. All physical observables must be recoverable through this map.
  philosophy: |
    To assert that Time is the substrate is to re-ground physics in a non-spatial ontology, treating spacetime as an effective, emergent description rather than a fundamental container. This prioritizes dynamics and relationality over a static background, aiming to resolve paradoxes at the intersection of GR and QM.

          1. Define a dynamics on the Time Substrate using CORE primitives (`Ki`, `Γ`, etc.).
          2. Apply the Standard Model Correspondence Gauge (SM-CG) map `Σ`.
          3. Calculate the resulting effective action `S_SM` in the appropriate limit.
          4. Compare the predictions of `S_SM` (e.g., scattering cross-sections, particle masses) with established experimental results from particle physics (e.g., from LHC, CODATA). The substrate's structure is inferred from the success of this mapping.

    excerpt: |
      Choose a spatialization map Σ that assigns local charts [x,y,z] to the time substrate so that, in the high-coherence, high-event-density limit, the effective action reduces to the Standard Model Lagrangian on a Lorentzian manifold. Standard Model/QFT successes in Pirouette are not coincidental: they are the Σ-shadow of a time-first substrate.

        Like Causal Set Theory or Loop Quantum Gravity, the Time Substrate model is 'pre-geometric', meaning it does not assume a pre-existing spacetime manifold. Instead, geometry and locality are emergent properties of the underlying structure's dynamics.

# Time Substrate

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The ontological foundation of reality, from which physical "space" is a derived chart or modeling gauge. The Time Substrate is the sole fundamental entity posited by CORE-016. All physical phenomena, including particles, fields, and the apparent structure of 3+1 spacetime, are emergent properties or relational dynamics *within* this substrate. Space is not a container but an observer-dependent coordinate system (a gauge) imposed on the substrate's dynamics.

## EFT-First Summary
The Time Substrate is a pre-geometric, non-local foundation from which the familiar 3+1 dimensional spacetime of the Standard Model and GR emerges as a low-energy, high-coherence effective description. All SM fields are interpreted as collective modes or gauge potentials derived from the substrate's fundamental dynamics via the SM Correspondence Gauge (CORE-016). This posits spacetime itself as an effective manifold arising from the coarse-graining of more fundamental, non-spatial degrees of freedom.
