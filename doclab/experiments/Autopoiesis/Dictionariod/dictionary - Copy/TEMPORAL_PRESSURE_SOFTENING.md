        Couple the aligner to Γ as required by Pirouette symmetry (pressure–density cross-term):
        L_int = λ_{HΓ} (H† H) Γ²  ⇒ α(Γ) = α₀ - λ_{HΓ}⟨Γ²⟩.
        Here α₀ ∝ k_eff > 0 encodes the bare alignment stiffness; the Γ background reduces curvature.

  art: |
    The universe is a stringed instrument, tuned by the stiffness of its time frames. Temporal pressure is the musician's hand gently pressing on the bridge, lowering the pitch until a new, deeper harmony can be played.
  law: |
    The quadratic coefficient `α` of the Higgs potential is a function of temporal pressure variance, `α(Γ) = α₀ - λ_HΓ⟨Γ²⟩`. An increase in `⟨Γ²⟩` softens the potential (reduces `α`), driving it toward a symmetry-breaking minimum.
  philosophy: |
    This mechanism grounds the electroweak scale in dynamics rather than fiat. The 'Mexican hat' is not a permanent feature of spacetime geometry but an emergent, conditional state induced by ambient temporal pressure, making the vacuum's structure contingent and potentially variable.
pirouette_definition: |
  Temporal-pressure softening is the mechanism by which the Higgs potential's quadratic term, `α|H|²`, acquires a negative contribution proportional to the variance of the temporal pressure field, `⟨Γ²⟩`. This contribution, `-λ_HΓ⟨Γ²⟩`, competes with the positive bare stiffness `α₀` from triad-clock frame alignment. When `⟨Γ²⟩` is sufficiently large to make `α(Γ) < 0`, a non-zero vacuum expectation value for the Higgs field `H` is induced, causing electroweak symmetry breaking.

          1. Precisely measure the Higgs trilinear coupling (`λ₃`), mass (`m_H`), and width (`Γ_H`).
          2. Measure the weak mixing angle (`sin²θ_W`) to constrain the frame stiffness ratio (`ρ_stiff`).
          3. Perform a global fit, attributing deviations from Standard Model predictions for these observables to a single underlying parameter shift `Δα` driven by `λ_HΓ⟨Γ²⟩`.
          4. The coherence of the fit validates the mechanism and measures `λ_HΓ`.

      Any Γ-induced correction to the vev `v` implies **coherent** shifts in the Higgs mass `m_H` and the Higgs self-coupling `λ ≡ β`, since `v² ≃ (1/2β)[λ_HΓ⟨Γ²⟩ - α₀]` and `m_H² = 2βv²`. This provides a powerful experimental test.

      justification: |
        In finite-temperature field theory, the effective Higgs mass-squared term `m²(T)` acquires a positive, stabilizing contribution from thermal fluctuations (`cT²`). Temporal-pressure softening is the inverse-sign analogue, where a background field (`Γ`) provides a *negative*, destabilizing contribution, like a negative temperature-squared effect.

      rationale: |
        The net effect of temporal-pressure softening overcoming the bare frame stiffness is to produce an effective negative quadratic coefficient `α(Γ) < 0`. This term is operationally identical to the ad-hoc `-μ² |H|²` term in the Standard Model Lagrangian, thereby providing a dynamical origin for it.

  disambiguation: |
    This mechanism is distinct from thermal softening/stiffening effects in QFT. Temporal-pressure softening is a T=0 effect driven by a background quantum field (`Γ`), not a thermal bath. The sign of the effect (softening) is also opposite to the usual thermal stiffening of a scalar field.

# Temporal-pressure Softening

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Temporal-pressure softening is the mechanism by which the Higgs potential's quadratic term, `α|H|²`, acquires a negative contribution proportional to the variance of the temporal pressure field, `⟨Γ²⟩`. This contribution, `-λ_HΓ⟨Γ²⟩`, competes with the positive bare stiffness `α₀` from triad-clock frame alignment. When `⟨Γ²⟩` is sufficiently large to make `α(Γ) < 0`, a non-zero vacuum expectation value for the Higgs field `H` is induced, causing electroweak symmetry breaking.

## EFT-First Summary
In the Standard Model, electroweak symmetry breaking is driven by a negative mass-squared term, `-μ²|H|²`, in the Higgs potential. Temporal-pressure Softening provides a dynamical origin for this term. It posits that `μ²` is not a fundamental constant but an effective parameter, `μ² = λ_HΓ⟨Γ²⟩ - α₀`, arising from the competition between a destabilizing pressure (`Γ`) and a stabilizing bare stiffness (`α₀`). This makes the electroweak scale contingent on the cosmological environment.
