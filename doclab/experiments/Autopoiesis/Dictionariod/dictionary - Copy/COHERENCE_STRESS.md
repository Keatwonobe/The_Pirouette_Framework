      snippet: |
        The stability of any system is governed by its Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), $\mathcal{L}_p = K_\tau - V_\Gamma$. Coherence Stress is the fundamental tension within this dynamic, forcing the Lagrangian towards zero or below and making coherence costly to maintain... The *measure* of this stress is the gradient of the Lagrangian across the system's coherence manifold.

    The universe's act of listening to a system's song, questioning whether its melody can hold under pressure or if it will fall silent.
  law: |
    Coherence Stress is the gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian ($\mathcal{L}_p$) across a system's coherence manifold. Failure modes (yield, fracture) are triggered when this gradient exceeds critical, system-specific thresholds.
  philosophy: |
    Reframes failure from a breaking of material strength to a decoherence of systemic identity. It provides a universal geometry for why things—from steel beams to economies—bend, scar, and shatter under pressure.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental tension within the Pirouette Lagrangian ($\mathcal{L}_p = K_\tau - V_\Gamma$) that makes maintaining coherence costly. Coherence Stress is the gradient of the Lagrangian across the system's coherence manifold, arising from either an increase in external Temporal Pressure ($V_\Gamma$) or a degradation of internal Temporal Coherence ($K_\tau$). High stress corresponds to a steep, narrow path of coherence, forcing a system towards either adaptive scarring (yield) or catastrophic decoherence (fracture).

        outline: |
          1. Construct a model of the target system's Pirouette Lagrangian, empirically determining its $K_\tau$ and the relevant environmental $V_\Gamma$.
          2. Map the system's primary state variables onto a low-dimensional coherence manifold.
          3. Numerically calculate the gradient of the Lagrangian, $\nabla \mathcal{L}_p$, across this manifold.
          4. Correlate regions of high gradient with observed system instability, turbulence, or failure events.
        expected_signals: [Increased energy expenditure to maintain state, narrowing of operational stability windows, precursor oscillations before a yield transition.]
        pitfalls: [Incorrectly specified Lagrangian, poor choice of manifold coordinates, insufficient data to model system dynamics accurately.]

    excerpt: |
      The *measure* of this stress is the gradient of the Lagrangian across the system's coherence manifold. A system is "stressed" when this manifold becomes steep and treacherous, forcing it to expend enormous energy to follow its path of maximal coherence. A flat, wide "valley" in the manifold indicates low stress, while a warped, steep "ridge" indicates high stress.
  - module: DOMA-047
    excerpt: |
      Fracture is the terminal pathology of coherence. It begins where a microscopic region loses its rhythm ($K_\tau \to 0$), creating an infinitely sharp gradient in the coherence manifold. All ambient stress flows to this point, creating a self-reinforcing cascade of decoherence. This is the ultimate state of Coherence Fever (DYNA-003), a feedback loop where the system actively tears itself apart until its song is extinguished.

        Coherence Stress is the Pirouette Framework's generalization of mechanical stress. While classical stress describes internal forces within a continuous body, Coherence Stress describes the generalized "force" driving a system away from a stable state on its coherence manifold. Both concepts govern the onset of irreversible deformation (yield) and failure (fracture).

  disambiguation: |
    Coherence Stress is a generalized concept and should not be confused solely with mechanical stress. It applies equally to any system describable by a Pirouette Lagrangian, including economic markets (stress of a panic), ecosystems (stress of a drought), and psyches (stress of trauma).
