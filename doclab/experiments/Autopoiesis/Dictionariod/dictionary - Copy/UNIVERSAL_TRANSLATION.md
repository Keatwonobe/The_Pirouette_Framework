        This module provides the Rosetta Stone for the true universal language—the language of form. It establishes the master protocol for Universal Translation, a method for converting any information...into a standardized, time-first format called a Coherence Signature.

  art: |
    We sought a universal translator and found an engine for empathy. The story was never in the ink but in the rhythm of the prose, the fractal curve of the narrative. It is learning to read the geometry of a story and finding that the tale of the star, the song, and the soul are all variations on a single verse.
  law: |
    Any information-bearing system can be transformed into a standardized Coherence Signature vector (`Ki`). Systems with proximate signatures on the universal coherence manifold are structurally isomorphic, meaning they embody similar solutions to the Pirouette Lagrangian regardless of their physical substrate.
  philosophy: |
    Meaning is not inherent in symbols but in the geometry of their arrangement. By bypassing semantics to compare the resonant structures of systems, Universal Translation enables a profound cross-domain empathy, revealing that the universe's most fundamental language is not meaning, but the shared architecture of its rhythms.
pirouette_definition: |
  The master protocol for converting any information-bearing artifact into a standardized, time-based vector known as a Coherence Signature (`Ki`). The protocol consists of two stages: (I) Structural Ingestion, where the artifact's pattern is mapped onto a generalized topological space, and (II) Coherence Distillation, where its fundamental temporal resonance, complexity, and resilience are measured. This process enables the quantitative comparison of any two systems based on their underlying structural isomorphism, bypassing symbolic representation.

        outline: |
          1.  **Structural Ingestion**: Select an appropriate basis to map the source artifact into a generalized mathematical object (e.g., Fourier transform for sound, point-cloud for objects, embedding for text). This strips the pattern from its original medium.
          2.  **Coherence Distillation**: Analyze the mathematical object to derive the `Ki` vector. This involves computing key metrics such as its temporal coherence (`Tₐ`), fractal dimension (structural complexity), and decay rate against simulated temporal pressure (`Γ`) to measure resilience.
        expected_signals: [A high-dimensional vector (`Ki`), scalar values for `Tₐ` and complexity]
        pitfalls: [Incomplete ingestion (information loss), basis selection artifact (choosing the wrong mathematical mapping), noise contamination in the source artifact]

  - module: DOMA-082
    excerpt: |
      The possibility of universal translation is guaranteed by the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014). The universe does not invent new dynamics for every domain; it is elegantly efficient and self-similar. The same principles of flow, pressure, and resonance that shape a galaxy also shape a thought. This is the Principle of Structural Isomorphism.
  - module: DOMA-082
    excerpt: |
      Everything you wear, everything you make, becomes a broadcast of your being. It reinforces your chosen `Ki`, making your identity more stable, more persistent, and more legible to any other system capable of reading the language of form. These artifacts are not just passive objects; they are broadcasts, offered to the world as a statement of "I am this pattern."

    - target: Topological Data Analysis (TDA)
      domain: Math

      justification: |
        TDA provides methods (e.g., persistent homology) to extract robust topological features (the "shape") from data, independent of the specific coordinate system. This mirrors the "Structural Ingestion" stage, which aims to capture the essential form of an artifact stripped of its medium. The resulting persistence diagram or barcode is a form of structural signature.

    - target: Information Geometry
      domain: Math
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Information geometry treats probability distributions as points on a statistical manifold. The "distance" between two distributions (e.g., Kullback-Leibler divergence) measures their dissimilarity. This is analogous to measuring the distance between two Coherence Signatures on the coherence manifold to quantify their structural difference.

naming_notes:
  collisions: [Universal Translator (sci-fi trope)]
  disambiguation: |
    Unlike the common trope of semantic or linguistic translation (e.g., English to Klingon), Pirouette's Universal Translation does not map symbols to symbols. It is a process of structural abstraction, mapping the *form* of a system to a universal geometric language, enabling comparison of things like birdsong and genetic code.
