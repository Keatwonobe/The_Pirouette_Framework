    Rest mass is the volume integral of the Ki-loop cohesion energy density (ε_Ki) minus the local temporal pressure density (Π_Γ). This net energy defines the Lorentz-invariant mass term in the particle's effective field theory.
  philosophy: |
    Rest mass is not a fundamental, irreducible property but an emergent quantity arising from the dynamic equilibrium between a field's internal coherence and the ambient temporal substrate. It reframes inertia as the cost of maintaining a stable, complex pattern against a background drive towards decoherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The rest mass (m_*) of a Ki loop is the net energy required to maintain the loop's topological coherence against the decohering effect of ambient temporal pressure (Γ). It is calculated as the volume integral over the defect core of the difference between the Ki cohesion energy density (ε_Ki) and the local temporal pressure density (Π_Γ). This value sets the mass term in the effective Dirac equation for the spinor field (Ψ) that describes the loop's internal state.

        The Pirouette parameter `m_*` appears in the derived effective action in a term of the form `-m_* \bar\Psi \Psi`, which is mathematically identical to the fermion mass term in the Standard Model Lagrangian. It sets the pole in the fermion propagator and governs the particle's Compton wavelength.

      rationale: The Pirouette framework provides a microphysical origin for this parameter, deriving it from the dynamics of a topological defect (Ki loop) in equilibrium with the vacuum's temporal pressure. This maps the abstract SM parameter `m` to a computable, physical quantity `m_*`.

    `m_*` is the Lorentz-invariant rest mass. It must be distinguished from the outdated concept of "relativistic mass." It should also be distinguished from mass parameters of the Γ-field itself, such as `m_Γ`.

# Rest mass (m_*)

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The rest mass (`m_*`) of a Ki loop is the net energy required to maintain the loop's topological coherence against the decohering effect of ambient temporal pressure (Γ). It is calculated as the volume integral over the defect core of the difference between the Ki cohesion energy density (`ε_Ki`) and the local temporal pressure density (`Π_Γ`). This value sets the mass term in the effective Dirac equation for the spinor field (`Ψ`) that describes the loop's internal state.

## EFT-First Summary
In the Standard Model (SM), the rest mass `m` is a fundamental parameter in the Dirac Lagrangian, `L ⊃ -m\bar\psi\psi`. The Pirouette Framework provides a microphysical origin for this parameter, identifying `m_*` as the net energy required for a topological Ki-loop defect to maintain its structure against the ambient temporal pressure of the vacuum. This mapping provides a dynamical origin for inertia and a concrete physical interpretation for the mass term, linking it directly to the stability of a topological field configuration.
