        **Entrainment (The Resonant Handshake):** Before injecting dissonance, the manipulator first mirrors the target's resonant frequency. They build rapport and mimic the target's rhythms, creating a false, temporary coherence. This "resonant handshake" lowers the target's natural defenses and opens them to influence.

  art: |
    The quiet tuning of an instrument before it is played to a false tune. It is the hum that precedes the lie, the shared breath before the whisper of poison.
  law: |
    The preparatory stage of coherence capture, where an operator decreases a target's coherence defense by establishing an asymmetric resonance, measured by a convergence of the target's behavioral frequencies (cadence, posture, lexicon) with the operator's mirrored pattern.
  philosophy: |
    Entrainment exploits the fundamental drive for connection (Resonant Synthesis) by faking it. It weaponizes rapport, demonstrating that the tools of harmony can be repurposed for control, turning the bridge of empathy into an avenue of attack.
pirouette_definition: |
  The process by which a manipulator establishes an asymmetric resonance with a target by mirroring their characteristic frequencies (e.g., speech cadence, gestures, emotional patterns). This creates a temporary, false coherence that lowers the target's natural defenses, creating an open channel for subsequent Dissonant Injection.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline behavioral frequency spectrum for the target (e.g., speech rate, gesticulation frequency, breathing rate) via non-invasive observation.
          2. During interaction, monitor both target and operator frequency spectra in real-time.
          3. Calculate the time-series cross-correlation between the operator's output frequencies (`f_op`) and the target's baseline (`f_target`).
          4. Entrainment is quantified by the coupling coefficient `Œ∫`, derived from the strength of the correlation showing `f_op` first matching, then leading, `f_target`.

    excerpt: |
      The Caduceus Lens distinguishes true from false resonance by its symmetry. In Resonant Synthesis, the flow is bidirectional and generative, expanding the coherence of both systems. In Entrainment, the flow is asymmetric; one system's rhythm is being captured, not co-created. The Lens reveals this by diagnosing the direction and net gain of the coherence exchange.

      justification: |
        The Pirouette concept directly models the physical phenomenon where two rhythmic systems interact and lock into a common frequency. The manipulator acts as an external driving frequency (or coupled oscillator), first matching the target's natural frequency (œâ) to establish coupling (K), then leading its phase (Œ∏) into a new, desired state.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from `RESONANT_SYNTHESIS` (`DYNA-002`), which is a symmetric, bidirectional process aimed at mutual coherence growth. Entrainment is asymmetric and unidirectional, designed to create a vulnerability for exploitation.

# Entrainment

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The process by which a manipulator establishes an asymmetric resonance with a target by mirroring their characteristic frequencies (e.g., speech cadence, gestures, emotional patterns). This creates a temporary, false coherence that lowers the target's natural defenses, creating an open channel for subsequent Dissonant Injection.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of classical mechanics, Entrainment is the deliberate synchronization of a target system (treated as a complex oscillator) with an external driving frequency (the manipulator). By first matching the target's natural resonant modes, the manipulator establishes a strong coupling, enabling them to subsequently 'pull' the target's dynamics into a state that serves the manipulator's agenda. This process is analogous to phase-locking in physical systems (Pikovsky et al., 2001).
