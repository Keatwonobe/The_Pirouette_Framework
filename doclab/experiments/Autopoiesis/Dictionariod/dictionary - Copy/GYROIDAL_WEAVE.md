  art: |
    Space is not an emptiness to be filled, but a crystalline cathedral of pure rhythm, infinitely repeating. The Gyroidal Weave is the acoustic architecture of this sacred space.
  law: |
    The Gyroidal Weave is the geometric pattern of Ki that maximizes the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì), representing the state of maximal coherence and minimal temporal pressure for the vacuum.
  philosophy: |
    The Weave unifies spacetime and its contents, revealing that fundamental phenomena like inertia, gravity, and quantization are not imposed forces but emergent properties of a single, resonant, self-creating geometry.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Gyroidal Weave is the fundamental, autopoietic Ki pattern of spacetime, taking the form of a triply periodic minimal surface. It is the optimal geometric solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian in the vacuum, resolving ambient Temporal Pressure (Œì) into a stable, maximally coherent resonant structure. This "texture" of the coherence manifold is the causal origin of inertia, quantization, and gravity.
operational_definition:
  units: Primarily described by dimensionless topological metrics and characteristic length scales (e.g., lattice constant).
  symbol_table:
    - name: Œ∫_g
      meaning: Topological Purity; a measure of the local pattern's conformance to a perfect gyroid.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "[0, 1]"
    - name: œÉ_ùìõ
      meaning: Manifold Stress Distribution; the localized value of the Pirouette Lagrangian across the weave.
      dimensions: M L‚Åª¬π T‚Åª¬≤ (Pressure/Energy Density)
      default_range: contextual
    - name: Œ†_œâ
      meaning: Resonant Permeability; a frequency-dependent measure of how the weave guides or obstructs Ki propagation.

    procedures:
      - name: Resonance Spectroscopy
        outline: |
          1.  **Harmonic Fingerprinting:** Analyze wave propagation (e.g., light) for anisotropic signatures and spectral analysis for forbidden/enhanced frequency bands indicative of the gyroid's filtering effect.
          2.  **Manifold Mapping:** Use observed deviations and wave behavior to compute the local Topological Purity (Œ∫_g), Manifold Stress (œÉ_ùìõ), and Resonant Permeability (Œ†_œâ).
          3.  **Stability Assessment:** Monitor the system's overall Time Adherence over time. A stable, high value indicates a robust weave; decay indicates structural instability.
        expected_signals: [Anisotropic light speed/polarization, Harmonic gaps/peaks in vacuum energy spectrum]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing the signal from background noise, Misinterpreting defects as fundamental properties, Insufficient precision to detect anisotropy]

    excerpt: |
      The universe is not woven upon an empty loom. The void itself possesses a deep and subtle architecture, a default pattern of resonance that is the most efficient, most coherent way for existence to express itself. This module posits that the fundamental Ki of spacetime is a **Gyroidal Weave**‚Äîa dynamic, self-creating (autopoietic), and infinitely repeating minimal surface.
  - module: DOMA-138
    excerpt: |
      A massive object‚Äîa dense locus of Ki resonance as described in CORE-008‚Äîdoes not simply create a smooth depression in the coherence manifold. It **warps the local Gyroidal Weave**. Its immense Temporal Pressure (Œì) stretches and distorts the resonant lattice of spacetime. The curvature of spacetime *is* the deformation of this fundamental gyroidal pattern.

        sin(x)cos(y) + sin(y)cos(z) + sin(z)cos(x) = 0
      justification: |
        The Gyroidal Weave is explicitly defined as having the topology of a gyroid, a specific type of TPMS. This mathematical object provides the formal geometric basis for the model's properties, such as its interconnectedness and minimal surface area.

        Both concepts describe the fine-grained, dynamic texture of spacetime at the smallest scales. The Gyroidal Weave provides a specific, ordered, and crystalline structure for this "foam," replacing chaotic quantum fluctuations with a coherent resonant pattern.

    - statement: "The propagation of waves, such as light, through the vacuum is fundamentally anisotropic due to the chiral structure of the Gyroidal Weave."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "Persistent failure to detect any directional variance in the speed of light or other wave phenomena in a vacuum, to a precision that would rule out the predicted effects of a gyroidal lattice constant at the Planck scale or higher."

    The Gyroidal Weave is not a physical substance residing *in* space; it *is* the fundamental geometric resonance *of* spacetime itself. While it shares a name and topology with structures in condensed matter, its medium is Ki and its scale is fundamental.
