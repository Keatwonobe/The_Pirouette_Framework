    The phase of the universe’s ticking, a local ‘now’ whose misalignment from particle to particle creates the currents of electromagnetism.
  law: |
    The gradient of the clock phase, ∂_μθ, couples to the gauge field A_μ as a conserved Noether current, J^μ_θ = κ(∂^μθ - q A^μ), establishing a universal source for the electromagnetic field.
  philosophy: |
    To ground electromagnetism not in an abstract U(1) symmetry, but in the physical, local phase coherence of the temporal medium. Charge becomes a measure of a particle's intrinsic desynchronization with the background clock.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dynamical scalar field, θ(x), representing the phase of the local temporal clock. Its dynamics are governed by a kinetic term, P(X) where X = -½(∂θ)², which near the Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM) becomes quadratic with stiffness κ. The field exhibits a shift symmetry, θ → θ + α, which, when gauged, introduces a minimal coupling (∂_μθ - q A_μ) to the connection field A_μ, identifying the clock phase gradient as the source of the electromagnetic current. On the CPM, the field is gapped and its fluctuations are integrated out, yielding a finite renormalization of the electromagnetic vertex.

        outline: |
          The parameters governing θ dynamics (stiffness κ, charge unit q) combine with the connection stiffness (g) to set the value of the fine-structure constant, α = (q²g²)/(4πħc). Precision measurements of α and its potential cosmological drift (via atomic clocks, quasar absorption lines) constrain the parameters of the clock phase sector and its coupling to the Γ-background.

          - A minuscule, negative secular drift (α̇/α < 0) on cosmological timescales.
        pitfalls:
          - Distinguishing the predicted Γ-tail drift from standard QED running.
          - Confounding astrophysical effects in quasar measurements of α.

    excerpt: |
      The (\theta) sector fixes the **unit of charge** via Berry-phase quantization around the Ki loop (MATH-QED-003). Small-amplitude expansion of the clock kinetic term yields the Noether current
      [
      J^\mu_\theta ;=; \kappa,(\partial^\mu\theta - q A^\mu),

      so matching to the electromagnetic source requires the **same (q)** for all spinor Ki defects (single-clock postulate).

      justification: |
        The clock phase θ transforms under a U(1) gauge transformation as θ → θ + λ alongside A_μ → A_μ + (1/q)∂_μλ. This is mathematically identical to the Stueckelberg mechanism for giving a gauge boson mass, or the phase of a complex scalar field in a broken symmetry phase. In Pirouette, however, this U(1) is not posited ad-hoc but emerges from the dynamics of the temporal medium.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, θ specifically refers to the phase of the temporal medium's local clock. It is always associated with the clock stiffness κ and the charge unit q. Context is key: if it appears in the covariant derivative form (∂_μθ - q A_μ), it is the Clock Phase.

# Clock Phase

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A dynamical scalar field, θ(x), representing the phase of the local temporal clock. Its dynamics are governed by a kinetic term, P(X) where X = -½(∂θ)², which near the Coherence-Preserving Manifold (CPM) becomes quadratic with stiffness κ. The field exhibits a shift symmetry, θ → θ + α, which, when gauged, introduces a minimal coupling (∂_μθ - q A_μ) to the connection field A_μ, identifying the clock phase gradient as the source of the electromagnetic current. On the CPM, the field is gapped and its fluctuations are integrated out, yielding a finite renormalization of the electromagnetic vertex.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of effective field theory, the Clock Phase θ behaves mathematically like the Goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken U(1) symmetry, as in the Stueckelberg mechanism or the London limit of a superconductor. Its gradient `∂_μθ` couples to the gauge field `A_μ` via the covariant derivative `D_μθ = ∂_μθ - q A_μ`. The crucial difference in Pirouette is that this structure is not fundamental but emerges from the dynamics of a physical temporal medium, with θ representing its local phase rather than being an independent matter field.
