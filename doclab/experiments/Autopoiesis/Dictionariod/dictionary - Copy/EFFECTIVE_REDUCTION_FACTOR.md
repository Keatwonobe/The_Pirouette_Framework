    When quarks hum together, their shared rhythm cancels the loudest parts of the song; only a faint over-tone—the Γ whisper—escapes. The hadron is a silenced drum, proof that even the quietest beats belong to the same cosmic percussion.
  law: |
    The Γ-field correction to a baryon's magnetic anomaly (Δa_B) is directly proportional to η_B and the square of the baryon-to-pressuron mass ratio: Δa_B = η_B * (g_Γ² / 8π²) * (M_B / m_Γ)².
  philosophy: |
    The factor η_B bridges the elementary and composite scales of the Pirouette Framework. It demonstrates how a fundamental interaction is naturally suppressed by the internal complexity of composite systems like baryons, preserving consistency with high-precision SM measurements while allowing for new physics to emerge in specific, coherent regimes.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dimensionless parameter (η_B ≪ 1) that quantifies the net suppression of the Pressuron (Γ) field's coupling to the temporal density of a composite baryon (B). This suppression arises from the combined effects of gluon-mediated screening and phase-cancellation (coherence damping) among the constituent quarks. It acts as an effective "form factor" for the Γ-interaction at low energies, scaling the magnitude of its observable consequences.

      - name: Magnetic Anomaly Inference
        outline: |
          1. Measure the anomalous magnetic moment of a baryon (e.g., proton `a_p` or neutron `a_n`) to a precision of 10⁻¹⁰ or better.
          2. Subtract all Standard Model (QED/QCD) contributions to compute the residual anomaly, Δa_B.
          3. Using independently constrained values for `g_Γ` and `m_Γ`, calculate η_B via the inversion: `η_B = Δa_B * (8π² / g_Γ²) * (m_Γ / M_B)²`.
        expected_signals: [A non-zero residual `Δa_p` on the order of `10⁻¹⁰`, or `Δa_n` on the order of `10⁻¹¹`.]
        pitfalls: [Other new physics may contribute to the residual anomaly. The determination is highly sensitive to the precision of `g_Γ` and `m_Γ` measurements.]

    excerpt: |
      At the constituent-quark level, Γ couples to **temporal density** rather than bare charge... Within a confined hadron, this coupling is **screened** by gluon coherence, giving an effective reduction factor ( η_B ≪ 1 ).
  - module: MATH-Γ-003
    excerpt: |
      Inside a baryon, Γ excitation manifests as a **beat pattern** between quark temporal phases. The coherence gradient of these beats defines ( η_B ). When baryons interact coherently (as in dense matter), Γ coupling enhances proportionally to local **phase alignment**, providing a natural link to nuclear binding corrections.

      justification: |
        Like electromagnetic form factors, η_B encapsulates the non-perturbative, emergent effects of a particle's composite structure on its interaction with an external field. While form factors are typically functions of momentum transfer (Q²), η_B acts as the static, zero-momentum-transfer limit of an effective form factor for the Γ-field interaction.

  disambiguation: |
    This factor represents a *reduction* or suppression (η_B ≪ 1) of a fundamental coupling due to internal structure. It should not be confused with an efficiency or an enhancement factor. It is specific to the Γ-field's interaction with composite baryons.
