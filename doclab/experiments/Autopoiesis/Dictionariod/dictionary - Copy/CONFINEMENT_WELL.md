      snippet: |
        The Gladiator Compass is a universal protocol for detecting and measuring these "arena walls" in any domain. ... The instrument translates a stream of events into a topographical map of the local coherence manifold, revealing the invisible structures of stability and control that shape reality.

  art: |
    A gravity well in the landscape of thought, where ideas orbit a stable center. We sought to measure the strength of the cage and instead learned how to draw a map of its walls, revealing the architecture of our confinement.
  law: |
    A region's confinement strength (Œ∫_G) is the product of the local path density (Œ¥) and coherence curvature (Œ≥). Where trajectories are both short and sharply bent, a confinement well is present.
  philosophy: |
    Confinement is not merely a constraint but a fundamental organizing principle that creates stable structures, from atoms to ideologies. To map these wells is to make the invisible architecture of power and stability visible, which is the first necessary step to navigating or dismantling it.
pirouette_definition: |
  A localized region of the coherence manifold characterized by a deep potential well (V_Œì). Generated by the feedback loop of a Gladiator Force, a Confinement Well warps the local landscape, forcing system trajectories (geodesics) into short, tightly curved paths around a stable center of high temporal pressure. It is a self-sustaining structure of high stability that confines a system's behavior.

        outline: |
          1. Ingest an ordered stream of system states and vectorize them.
          2. Within a sliding window, calculate path density (Œ¥) as the inverse of the mean divergence between consecutive state vectors.
          3. In the same window, calculate coherence curvature (Œ≥) as the normalized change in trajectory (gradient of the coherence metric).
          4. Compute Confinement Strength as Œ∫_G = Œ¥ √ó Œ≥.
          5. Plot the resulting Œ∫_G field; local maxima indicate well centers.
        expected_signals: [Spatially or temporally localized peaks in the Œ∫_G field, high-frequency oscillations in system state vectors near a central point]
        pitfalls: [Choosing an incorrect window size, misinterpreting high-frequency noise as high curvature, state-space vectorization artifacts]

    excerpt: |
      The Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`) describes a non-linear feedback loop where a system's own resonance forges a stable "arena" or "coherence well." This well, a region of intense local Temporal Pressure (`CORE-003`), profoundly warps the local coherence manifold.
  - module: DOMA-140
    excerpt: |
      Within such a well, the geodesics of maximal coherence are no longer straight lines. They are short, tightly curved paths that orbit the well's center. The Gladiator Compass works by observing these distorted paths. By measuring the degree of distortion, we can infer the depth of the well.

      justification: |
        A Confinement Well is explicitly defined as a deep potential well (V_Œì) in the Pirouette Lagrangian. It acts as an attractor, confining system dynamics by exerting a force proportional to the gradient of the potential, a direct analog to classical and quantum potential wells.

      justification: |
        The alias "Cognitive Gravity Well" points to this analogy. The well warps the "geometry of the landscape" (coherence manifold), causing entities to follow curved paths (geodesics), directly mirroring how mass-energy warps spacetime in General Relativity.

  claims:
    - statement: "The stability of a system (e.g., an ideology, a particle) is directly proportional to the measured Confinement Strength (Œ∫_G) of the well it inhabits."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observing a highly stable, long-lived system that registers a low Œ∫_G, or a highly unstable system registering a high Œ∫_G, would falsify the claimed relationship between geometric confinement and systemic stability."

  disambiguation: |
    The Confinement Well is the *structure* or *region* in the coherence manifold. It is caused by the *Gladiator Force* and its depth is measured by the *Confinement Strength* (Œ∫_G). Do not confuse the structure with its cause or its measurement.
