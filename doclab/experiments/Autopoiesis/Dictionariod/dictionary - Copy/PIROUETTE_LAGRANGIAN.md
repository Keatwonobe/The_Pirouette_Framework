        The Pirouette Lagrangian describes the state of a system in terms of two fundamental quantities: its internal stability and its external pressure. It takes the familiar form of L = T - V, but reinterprets the terms: 𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)

  law: |
    A system's trajectory through configuration space will be one that maximizes the integral of 𝓛_p over its characteristic cycle (S_p = ∫₀^τ_p 𝓛_p dt), a principle known as Maximal Coherence.
  philosophy: |
    The Lagrangian re-frames dynamics not as energy minimization but as coherence maximization. It posits that the fundamental drive of any system is not just to exist, but to sustain the most elegant and stable pattern possible against environmental pressure, making survival an act of dynamic resonance.
pirouette_definition: |
  A function that quantifies a system's dynamic state as the difference between its internal Temporal Coherence (K_τ) and the external Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) it experiences from its environment. The Lagrangian is expressed as 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ = (T_a * ω_k) - f(Γ). Maximizing the time-integral of 𝓛_p (the Pirouette Action, S_p) determines the system's path and evolution.

          The Lagrangian is not measured directly but is inferred from a system's behavior. Observe a system's trajectory q(t) within a well-characterized Temporal Pressure field V_Γ. The parameters of the system's internal Temporal Coherence (K_τ) are determined by finding the values that make the observed trajectory the one that maximizes the Pirouette Action S_p.

      By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to 𝓛_p, we derive the equations of motion for a system. These equations describe how a system must change its trajectory in response to changes in the surrounding temporal environment (Γ). A particle moving towards a massive star isn't being "pulled" by gravity; it is following a path of continuously adjusting its internal rhythm to maintain maximal coherence...

      justification: |
        The Pirouette Lagrangian explicitly adopts the mathematical structure of the classical Lagrangian (Kinetic - Potential energy) but redefines the terms. Temporal Coherence (K_τ) plays the role of kinetic energy (internal dynamics), while Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) plays the role of potential energy (environmental constraint). The framework replaces the Principle of Least Action with a Principle of Maximal Coherence.

    While structurally identical to the classical Lagrangian (Kinetic - Potential), 𝓛_p should not be mistaken for an energy-based function. Its components, Coherence and Pressure, are not direct measures of energy but of temporal stability and environmental resistance, respectively.

# Pirouette Lagrangian

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A function that quantifies a system's dynamic state as the difference between its internal Temporal Coherence (K_τ) and the external Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) it experiences from its environment. The Lagrangian is expressed as 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ = (T_a * ω_k) - f(Γ). Maximizing the time-integral of 𝓛_p (the Pirouette Action, S_p) determines the system's path and evolution.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) is a direct analogue to the classical Lagrangian (L = T - V). The 'kinetic' term T is replaced by Temporal Coherence (K_τ), a measure of a system's internal resonant stability, and the 'potential' term V is replaced by Temporal Pressure (V_Γ), a measure of environmental decohering influence. The dynamics are governed by a principle of stationary action, where the action S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt is maximized, not minimized.
