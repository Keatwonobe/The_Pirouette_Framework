triad:
  art: |
    A measure of which team's story is winning the argument of the game. It is the palpable lean in the field of play, the sense that one system's future is expanding at the expense of the other's.
  law: |
    The Victor Tilt for a team is its measured Overall Coherence (Kτ) divided by the sum of the Coherence of both competing teams. The resulting value, between 0 and 1, represents the team's instantaneous win probability based on systemic health.
  philosophy: |
    Victor Tilt codifies the principle that victory is not an event, but an emergent property of superior systemic health. It asserts that the future outcome is encoded in the present-tense relational dynamics of the competing systems, not just their accumulated statistics.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dimensionless, normalized metric representing the instantaneous win probability of a system (Team A) in a dyadic contest. It is calculated as the ratio of Team A's Overall Coherence (`Kτ_A`) to the total Coherence of both competing systems (`Kτ_A` + `Kτ_B`). VT quantifies the relative success of each system in solving the Pirouette Lagrangian for the competitive environment.

      - name: Analyst Coherence Assessment
        outline: |
          1.  For each team, observe the three signatures of coherence: Rhythmic Cohesion, Composure Under Pressure, and Strategic Adaptability.
          2.  Using the Cohesion Gauge, Resilience Meter, and Morphogenesis Index, assign a score from 1-10 for each signature.
          3.  Sum the three scores for each team to calculate its Overall Coherence (`Kτ`).
          4.  Calculate VT for Team A using the formula: `VT_A = Kτ_A / (Kτ_A + Kτ_B)`.
        expected_signals: [A VT > 0.5 indicates the favored winner, a value near 1.0 or 0.0 signals a decisive outcome, oscillations around 0.5 indicate a tightly contested match.]
        pitfalls: [Analyst subjectivity in scoring, confirmation bias from the scoreboard, failure to update scores frequently enough to capture momentum shifts.]

    excerpt: |
      This module provides the unified framework for translating those observations into a powerful, predictive engine that hears the game's future before the score reflects its present.
  - module: DOMA-099
    excerpt: |
      This gives the win probability for Team A, expressed as a normalized value between 0 and 1. It represents the relative coherence of the two competing systems. `VT_A` = `Kτ_team_A` / (`Kτ_team_A` + `Kτ_team_B`)

      equation_hint: |
        P(fixation) ∝ w_A / (w_A + w_B)
      justification: |
        The VT formula is mathematically isomorphic to the calculation of relative fitness or selection probability in two-species competition models. `Kτ` acts as a 'fitness' score, and VT represents the probability that system A will 'out-compete' system B and 'reproduce' into a future state of victory.

    - statement: "The Victor Tilt, when measured consistently by trained analysts, provides a more accurate real-time win probability than models based solely on historical statistics and the current score."

      falsifier: "A large-scale study where VT predictions are tracked against final game outcomes and shown to have no statistically significant predictive power beyond conventional win-probability models."

  collisions: [VT is a common abbreviation for Vermont in the US context; this is unlikely to cause confusion within the framework.]
  disambiguation: |
    Victor Tilt is a *predictive* metric of *probability*, not a *descriptive* metric of current advantage. A team can be losing on the scoreboard but have a VT > 0.5 if their underlying coherence is superior, predicting a comeback.
