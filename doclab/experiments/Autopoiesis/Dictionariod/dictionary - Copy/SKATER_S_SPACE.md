    A map of grace, charting a skater's journey from the choppy struggle of a novice to the effortless glide of a master. It measures not just the power to move, but the artistry of the path taken.
  law: |
    A skater's motion quality (Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant) is a direct function of their coordinates `(K_œÑ, V_Œì)` in Skater's Space, where `K_œÑ` represents mastery of internal coherence modulation and `V_Œì` represents power over external field projection. Optimal (Laminar) flow requires high proficiency on both axes.
  philosophy: |
    Skater's Space reframes proficiency away from raw power and toward dynamic harmony. It asserts that true mastery is not conquering an external reality but achieving a state of internal-external resonance, where the self and the world move as one.
pirouette_definition: |
  A two-dimensional abstract space that quantifies an entity's proficiency at Geodesic Skating. The two orthogonal axes are the **Internal Axis (Mastery of the Blade)**, representing the ability to precisely modulate internal coherence (`K_œÑ`), and the **External Axis (Power of the Wake)**, representing the ability to project resonance and shape the ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`). An entity's coordinates within this space determine the flow state (Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant) of its motion.

        outline: |
          Perform a high-resolution scan of the coherence manifold in the wake of a skater's transit (their Wound Channel). The sharpness, depth, and modulation frequency of the channel's geometry correlate to the Internal Axis score. The amplitude, coherence, and propagation distance of the residual Temporal Pressure gradient correlate to the External Axis score.
        expected_signals: [Wound Channel geometry (depth, width, gradient), residual Temporal Pressure fluctuations]
        pitfalls: [Environmental noise distorting the Wound Channel, conflating skater skill with favorable medium properties, observer effects from the measurement process itself.]

    excerpt: |
      The quality and efficiency of the skate are diagnosed using the language of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`). The state of flow is determined by the harmony between the skater's internal rhythm and the properties of the external medium... A master skater is one who has achieved high proficiency along both axes, capable of carving elegant, powerful, and efficient paths through the manifold of reality, maintaining a Laminar Skate even in challenging conditions.

      justification: |
        Skater's Space functions as a control parameter space for a dynamic system. The two axes represent the available 'gain' or 'amplitude' on two control inputs (internal state modulation and external field projection) that drive the system's trajectory. The resulting 'flow state' is analogous to system stability (e.g., stable limit cycle vs. chaotic trajectory).

# Skater's Space

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A two-dimensional abstract space that quantifies an entity's proficiency at Geodesic Skating. The two orthogonal axes are the **Internal Axis (Mastery of the Blade)**, representing the ability to precisely modulate internal coherence (`K_œÑ`), and the **External Axis (Power of the Wake)**, representing the ability to project resonance and shape the ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`). An entity's coordinates within this space determine the flow state (Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant) of its motion.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of control theory, Skater's Space is a two-dimensional control parameter space mapping an entity's ability to drive its own geodesic motion. The axes correspond to the control authority over an internal degree of freedom (Coherence, `K_œÑ`) and the ability to project an external field (shaping Temporal Pressure, `V_Œì`). The quality of the resulting trajectory ('Flow State') is a function of the entity's coordinates in this space, analogous to determining system stability from control parameter values.
