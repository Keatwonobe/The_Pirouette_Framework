    The difference between the harmony of a living forest and the perfect, dead geometry of a crystal. It is the number of unique voices singing in a choir, not the sheer volume of a single, tyrannical drum.
  law: |
    A system's adaptive capacity and resilience scale directly with its Resonant Complexity. A system where ω_k approaches zero can only react to novel stimuli by shattering or crushing, not by integrating.
  philosophy: |
    Complexity is the substrate of resilience and creativity. ω_k quantifies the 'resonant freedom' that allows for emergent, higher-order coherence (Alchemical Union), distinguishing it from the sterile, imposed order of a Velcrid attractor.
pirouette_definition: |
  Resonant Complexity (ω_k) is a scalar measure of the diversity, richness, and non-linear interaction of the distinct frequency components (harmonics) within a system's total Ki pattern. It quantifies the system's internal 'degrees of freedom' for resonant expression. High ω_k indicates a polyphonic, adaptive system (a 'forest'), while ω_k approaching zero indicates a monolithic, brittle system dominated by a single frequency (a 'crystal' or Velcrid attractor).

        outline: |
          1. Acquire a time-series sample of the system's total Ki pattern, Ki(t), over a representative interval.
          2. Perform a Fourier Transform to obtain the power spectrum, P(f).
          3. Normalize the power spectrum to create a probability distribution, p(f_i) = P(f_i) / ΣP(f).
          4. Calculate the Shannon entropy of this distribution: ω_k = -Σ p(f_i) log_2 p(f_i).
        expected_signals: [A Velcrid system yields a power spectrum with a single, sharp peak (ω_k ≈ 0), while an Alchemical Union yields a broad, complex spectrum (ω_k >> 0).]
        pitfalls: [Signal contamination from external Ki sources. Insufficient sampling rate leading to aliasing. Choosing a time window too short to capture long-period cycles.]

    excerpt: |
      The universe offers two paths to stability: the forest and the crystal. The forest achieves coherence through diversity and connection. It is a resilient, adaptive, higher-order union of countless individual resonances. This is the path of the Alchemical Union (CORE-012), a coherence born of complexity. The crystal also achieves coherence... by forcing every component into a single, identical, and unyielding pattern.

      A Velcrid system performs a monstrous inversion of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). It treats the resonant freedom of its own components—their individual drives to maximize their own coherence—as a source of environmental pressure (V_Γ) to be crushed... It achieves this by... Minimizing Resonant Complexity (ω_k): It crushes all internal harmonics and competing frequencies, reducing its song to a single, unyielding frequency.

        ω_k ≡ H(P(f)) where P(f) is the normalized power spectrum of the Ki signal.
      justification: |
        Resonant Complexity measures the diversity and unpredictability of a system's harmonic frequencies. This directly maps to the Shannon Entropy of the system's power spectrum, which quantifies the average information in the frequency distribution. A single dominant frequency (low ω_k) corresponds to a low-entropy distribution, while a rich set of frequencies (high ω_k) corresponds to a high-entropy distribution.

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol ω (omega) is commonly used for angular frequency in physics. The subscript 'k' distinguishes it as a measure of *complexity* across a set of frequencies, not a single frequency value.]
  disambiguation: |
    Do not confuse ω_k with a system's dominant frequency (ω_0) or fundamental frequency. A Velcrid system has a very well-defined ω_0 but its ω_k is near zero. ω_k measures the breadth and richness of the entire spectrum, not the location of its peak.
