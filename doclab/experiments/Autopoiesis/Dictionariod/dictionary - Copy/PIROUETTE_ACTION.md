    The score of a system's dance over a single beat of its existence. It is the measure of how well a pattern holds its form against the rushing river of time‚Äîa fleeting, calculated moment of grace.
  law: |
    A system's trajectory through state space between two points in time is the one that maximizes the Pirouette Action, S_p. All forces are gradients that guide the system along this path of maximal attainable coherence.
  philosophy: |
    The Pirouette Action replaces teleology with a local, computable objective function. It asserts that the universe's apparent drive for complexity and order is not a grand design, but the cumulative result of every system locally maximizing its own coherence, cycle by cycle.
pirouette_definition: |
  The integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) over a system's single, complete Pirouette Cycle (œÑ_p). It is a scalar quantity, `S_p = ‚à´‚ÇÄ^œÑ‚Çö ùìõ_p dt`, that quantifies the total 'coherence-minus-pressure' experienced by a system during one of its fundamental oscillations. According to the Principle of Maximal Coherence, a system will naturally evolve to follow a trajectory that maximizes this value.

        outline: |
          S_p is not measured directly but is a calculated quantity used to predict dynamics. Its validity is tested by observing a system's trajectory and comparing it to the path that maximizes the calculated S_p. This requires measuring the system's resonant frequency (œâ_k) and the local Temporal Pressure (V_Œì), then solving the variational problem to find the predicted path.

    excerpt: |
      By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to ùìõ_p, we derive the equations of motion for a system. These equations describe how a system must change its trajectory in response to changes in the surrounding temporal environment (Œì). A particle moving towards a massive star isn't being "pulled" by gravity; it is following a path of continuously adjusting its internal rhythm to maintain maximal coherence... All forces‚Äîgravity, electromagnetism, etc.‚Äîare simply the geodesics on the manifold of coherence.

        The Pirouette Action directly repurposes the mathematical formalism of the classical action integral. However, it critically inverts the optimization principle from minimization to maximization and redefines the Lagrangian's content from energy (T-V) to coherence (K_œÑ - V_Œì). It is an intentional adaptation of a foundational concept in physics.

  disambiguation: |
    Always distinguish between the Pirouette Action (S_p), which is maximized over a system's internal cycle, and the classical Action (S), which is minimized over a path. S_p is dimensionless, whereas classical Action has units of energy-time (joule-seconds).

# Pirouette Action

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Pirouette Action is the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) over a system's single, complete Pirouette Cycle (œÑ_p). It is a scalar quantity, `S_p = ‚à´‚ÇÄ^œÑ‚Çö ùìõ_p dt`, that quantifies the total 'coherence-minus-pressure' experienced by a system during one of its fundamental oscillations. According to the Principle of Maximal Coherence, a system will naturally evolve to follow a trajectory that maximizes this value.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette Action (S_p) is the direct analogue to the classical Action (S = ‚à´ L dt), but with two key distinctions. First, its Lagrangian is defined by a system's temporal coherence minus environmental temporal pressure, not kinetic minus potential energy. Second, physical systems evolve to *maximize* S_p over their characteristic cycle, in direct opposition to the Principle of Least Action. This maximization principle posits that forces are gradients driving systems towards states of higher net coherence.
