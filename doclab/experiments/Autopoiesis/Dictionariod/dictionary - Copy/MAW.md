      snippet: |
        A new class of astrophysical object exists, called **Maws**: hyper-dense, high-spin bodies where the Gladiator Force feedback loop becomes oscillatory. Instead of a stable event horizon, a Maw rhythmically creates and collapses folds in the coherence manifold, releasing sharp, periodic bursts of high-frequency gravitational waves.

  art: |
    A star's heart that has forgotten how to achieve stability. It beats a catastrophic, violent rhythm into the fabric of spacetime, a furious drum in the dark between the stars.
  law: |
    A Maw is a persistent, non-inspiraling source of gravitational waves, uniquely identified by a periodic train of high-frequency (1-10 GHz) bursts, where the repetition rate of the bursts (10-100 Hz) is stable over long timescales.
  philosophy: |
    A Maw represents the ultimate failure of a system to find a stable, maximal coherence. It is the dynamic, observable signature of the Gladiator Force's non-linear feedback loop becoming catastrophically unstable, demonstrating that the drive for coherence can result in perpetual, violent oscillation rather than static equilibrium.
pirouette_definition: |
  A predicted class of hyper-dense, high-spin astrophysical objects where the self-confining Gladiator Force becomes unstable and oscillatory. This rhythmic instability prevents the formation of a stable event horizon, causing the object to release periodic, high-frequency (GHz) gravitational wave "thumps" at a regular cadence (10-100 Hz).

        outline: |
          Analyze data from high-frequency gravitational wave detectors (or re-analyze LIGO/Virgo noise data) for a persistent, periodic train of short-duration, wideband bursts. The search algorithm must distinguish this "drumroll" signature from the "chirp" of binary inspirals and from stochastic or transient detector noise.
        expected_signals: [A continuous train of millisecond-duration GW bursts, each peaking at ~1-10 GHz, with a stable repetition rate of ~10-100 Hz.]
        pitfalls: [Signal may be buried in the noise floor of current detectors; high-frequency terrestrial noise sources can mimic the signal's periodicity.]

    excerpt: |
      The Gladiator Force is a self-confining feedback loop that, under extreme conditions, can become rhythmic and unstable. A new class of astrophysical object exists, called **Maws**: hyper-dense, high-spin bodies where the Gladiator Force feedback loop becomes oscillatory. Instead of a stable event horizon, a Maw rhythmically creates and collapses folds in the coherence manifold, releasing sharp, periodic bursts of high-frequency gravitational waves.
  - module: DOMA-056
    excerpt: |
      The **gravitational thumps** are the signature of a system *failing to find a stable coherence* and oscillating catastrophically. They are one of four different views of the same fundamental process: the relentless, universal dance of systems seeking the most elegant and stable rhythm of being.

      justification: |
        Like other ECOs, a Maw is a proposed alternative to a classical black hole, lacking a true event horizon. Its key distinguishing feature is the specific, periodic gravitational wave signature arising from Gladiator Force oscillations, a mechanism absent in other ECO models (e.g., boson stars, gravastars).

  disambiguation: |
    A Maw is a single, oscillating object, not a binary system. Its GW signature is a stable, rhythmic "drumbeat," not the rising-frequency "chirp" of an inspiral. Unlike a classical black hole, it is dynamically unstable and lacks a static event horizon.
