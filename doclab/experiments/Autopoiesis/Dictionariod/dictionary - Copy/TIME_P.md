        Time (τ_p): The fundamental event. It is the duration of one complete cycle of a system's resonant Ki pattern. It is the universe's verb.

  art: |
    A system's existence is a single note held in the cosmic song. τ_p is the duration of that note—the time it takes the dancer to complete one turn, defining both itself and its own moment.
  law: |
    For any stable system S, its intrinsic time τ_p is the measured period of its dominant Ki resonance mode, such that τ_p = 1/f_Ki. All other dynamical timescales within the system are rational multiples of τ_p.
  philosophy: |
    Time is not a universal, passive background, but an active, local, and emergent property of a system's own existence. A system *is* its cycle; to stop the cycle is to cease to be.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental event of existence, defined as the duration of one complete, self-sustaining cycle of a system's Temporal Resonance (Ki). It is not a coordinate in spacetime, but the intrinsic, rhythmic act by which a system persists against its local Temporal Density (Γ). Each τ_p is a quantum of a system's unique "now," generated by the autopoietic loop: Time → Γ → Ki → Time.

        outline: |
          Identify the system S under investigation. Excite the system or passively observe its emissions/oscillations. Perform a Fourier analysis or similar time-series decomposition to identify the dominant, self-sustaining resonant frequency, f_Ki. τ_p is calculated as 1/f_Ki.

      Form Defines Time: This stable, resonant Ki pattern is cyclical. The duration of one of its complete cycles is the system's own intrinsic, meaningful unit of existence. This is a quantum of Time (τ_p).

      This is not a linear sequence. It is a single, instantaneous, and perpetual event. Time → Γ → Ki → Time. The song composes, performs, and hears itself in a single act.

        τ_p ≈ 1/f_de_Broglie = h/E
      justification: |
        The de Broglie relation posits an intrinsic frequency for any particle with energy E. In Pirouette, a stable particle is a persistent Ki pattern. This suggests that τ_p for a fundamental particle could be operationally identified with the period corresponding to its total energy, representing the fundamental cycle of its existence.

  disambiguation: |
    τ_p is not a coordinate time like the 't' in spacetime diagrams. It is a local, system-dependent *duration* of a fundamental process, more akin to the period of an oscillator than a point on a timeline.

# Time (τ_p)

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The fundamental event of existence, defined as the duration of one complete, self-sustaining cycle of a system's Temporal Resonance (Ki). It is not a coordinate in spacetime, but the intrinsic, rhythmic act by which a system persists against its local Temporal Density (Γ). Each τ_p is a quantum of a system's unique "now," generated by the autopoietic loop: Time → Γ → Ki → Time.

## EFT-First Summary
No formal mapping to Effective Field Theory has been ratified. Conceptually, τ_p corresponds to the period of a system's fundamental quantum oscillation (e.g., its de Broglie frequency), representing the most basic 'clock' of the system from which all other dynamics derive. Its measurement is proposed via Ki-Mode Spectroscopy, identifying the dominant resonant frequency of the system.
