        The rupture is the moment the dam breaks. It is not the introduction of a new force, but the catastrophic failure of the old one. The physical or conceptual structure enforcing the confinement fails. From a Lagrangian perspective, this is a sudden and violent collapse of the potential term (`V_Γ → 0`).

  art: |
    The breaking of a dam that transforms the immense, silent weight of water into the roaring, coherent power of a wave. It is the physics of a ringing bell: a sharp strike that births a pure, resonant song from mute metal.
  law: |
    A Rupture occurs if and only if the confining temporal pressure `V_Γ` collapses to near-zero on a timescale significantly shorter than the system's natural resonant period. The total energy stored during confinement is conserved and converted into a coherent, resonant wave whose form is determined by the system's intrinsic Ki pattern.
  philosophy: |
    Rupture reframes catastrophe not as chaotic failure, but as a necessary and information-rich release of accumulated potential. It posits that the most profound insights and purest expressions are forged under immense pressure and revealed only when that pressure violently collapses, transforming stillness into song.
pirouette_definition: |
  The catastrophic phase transition in which the Gladiator Force sustaining a system's confinement fails, causing the temporal pressure potential `V_Γ` to collapse to zero. This sudden removal of the potential term from the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`) forces the system to evolve under the dominance of its temporal coherence kinetic term `K_τ`. The result is the conversion of all stored potential energy into a coherent, resonant wave—a coherence cascade—whose structure is dictated by the system's intrinsic Ki pattern.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline for a system under high confinement, characterized by a large, stable `V_Γ` and `K_τ` ≈ 0.
          2. Monitor for a sudden, non-linear change in system state (e.g., energy emission, structural change).
          3. Post-event, measure the system's energy spectrum and temporal dynamics. A Rupture is confirmed if `V_Γ` has collapsed to near-zero and the emitted energy is concentrated in a narrow-band, coherent, resonant mode (`K_τ >> 0`).

      The rupture is the moment the dam breaks. It is not the introduction of a new force, but the catastrophic failure of the old one. The physical or conceptual structure enforcing the confinement fails. From a Lagrangian perspective, this is a sudden and violent collapse of the potential term (`V_Γ → 0`). The deep coherence well that defined the system's stability is instantly leveled; the canyon walls vanish.
  - module: DOMA-078
    excerpt: |
      The rupture is the catastrophic phase transition where `V_Γ → 0`. The suddenness of this collapse is crucial; a slow leak of pressure would result in gradual adjustment, not a resonant cascade. The system's drive to maximize its Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`) transforms a destructive explosion into a structured, information-rich signal—a pure Ki pattern.

        Rupture describes the sudden release of stored potential energy as a system's confining boundary conditions or potential landscape catastrophically change. This is analogous to a system trapped in a metastable state (a false vacuum) suddenly tunneling or rolling to a true vacuum, converting the potential energy difference into kinetic energy of particle fields.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'fracture' or 'break', which describe the physical failure mechanism of the confining structure. Rupture refers to the energetic phase transition itself, not the cause of confinement failure. Also distinguish from 'dissipation', which implies a slow, gradual, and often incoherent release of pressure.

# Rupture

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The catastrophic phase transition in which the Gladiator Force sustaining a system's confinement fails, causing the temporal pressure potential `V_Γ` to collapse to zero. This sudden removal of the potential term from the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`) forces the system to evolve under the dominance of its temporal coherence kinetic term `K_τ`. The result is the conversion of all stored potential energy into a coherent, resonant wave—a coherence cascade—whose structure is dictated by the system's intrinsic Ki pattern.

## EFT-First Summary
A Rupture is conceptually analogous to a catastrophic first-order phase transition, such as false vacuum decay. A system previously trapped in a deep, metastable potential well (`V_Γ >> 0`) experiences an abrupt flattening of its potential landscape. This triggers a rapid conversion of the stored potential energy difference into coherent, oscillatory kinetic modes as the system seeks its new ground state.
