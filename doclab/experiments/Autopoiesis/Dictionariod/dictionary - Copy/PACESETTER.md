        To the family member or friend assisting in this recovery: your role now evolves. You were the Anchor in the storm. Now, as the journey begins, you become the Pacesetter. A runner in a long race relies on a pacesetter not for strength, but for rhythm. That is your purpose now.

triad:
  art: |
    The Pacesetter is the steady beat in the quiet song of recovery, a living metronome whose presence turns a solitary walk into a shared journey. They are the mirror reflecting nascent strength, making invisible progress tangible.
  law: |
    The Pacesetter's function is to establish and maintain a conversational-pace rhythm during a Geodesic Walk, log patient biometrics (Resting Heart Rate) and subjective scores (Flow Score) daily, and present a weekly trend analysis to reinforce progress.
  philosophy: |
    By externalizing the functions of rhythm-keeping and progress-monitoring, the Pacesetter allows the patient to focus entirely on the internal experience of 'Coherence Seeding', transforming a cognitive burden into a relational, supportive process. The role is not to lead, but to attune and witness.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Pacesetter (Ψ_H) is the designated helper's role in Phase II recovery protocols. This role has three primary functions: 1) To provide a steady, external rhythm during activities like the Geodesic Walk, ensuring the patient maintains a pace within the 'Conversation Test' limits. 2) To act as a 'Mirror of Progress,' verbally reinforcing small victories and functional achievements. 3) To serve as the 'Scribe,' diligently maintaining the Coherence Ledger and using the logged data to illustrate the patient's recovery trajectory.

        outline: |
          Weekly review of the helper's adherence to the three core functions.
          1. **Rhythm:** Observe a Geodesic Walk, verifying the helper matches the patient's pace and uses the 'Conversation Test' to modulate speed.
          2. **Mirroring:** Tally instances of verbal reinforcement of patient progress during the week.
          3. **Scribing:** Audit the Coherence Ledger for completeness (daily RHR and Flow Score) and check if the weekly data-storytelling session occurred.
        expected_signals: [Completed Coherence Ledger (line graph), Patient self-report of feeling supported/not pushed, Stable or decreasing Resting Heart Rate over time]
        pitfalls: [Helper imposing their own pace instead of matching the patient's, Focusing on data entry without the 'storytelling' component, Over-praising or providing inauthentic feedback]

    excerpt: |
      Helper's Role (The Pacesetter): Walk With Them: Walk beside the patient, matching their pace. Your steady presence is a non-verbal encouragement. Be the Conversation: Your job is to manage the 'Conversation Test.' Keep them engaged in a light, pleasant conversation. If their speech becomes strained, it's a clear signal to slow down.

      justification: |
        The Pacesetter provides temporary external support (rhythm, monitoring, motivation) to enable the patient to perform the task of recovery, which they could not yet manage alone. This support is gradually withdrawn as the patient internalizes the skills and builds capacity, fitting the definition of educational scaffolding.

      confidence: 0.7
  adopted:
    - target: Scaffolding (Vygotsky)
      rationale: "The mapping to 'scaffolding' is operationally strong, as the Pacesetter's role is to provide temporary external structure (rhythm, data logging, motivation) that the patient eventually internalizes as a self-sustaining habit. This aligns well with the protocol's goal of 'Coherence Seeding'."

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "The presence of a trained Pacesetter during Phase II recovery leads to a statistically significant faster stabilization of resting heart rate and higher adherence to daily walking protocols compared to patients who are self-guided."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A controlled trial shows no significant difference in RHR stabilization, weekly 'Flow Score' trends, or protocol adherence between a Pacesetter-assisted group and a control group using only a self-monitoring app."

  disambiguation: |
    Pacesetter is a human role involving behavioral and emotional support, distinct from an implantable electronic 'pacemaker' that regulates heart rhythm directly. The Pacesetter influences the *body's system rhythm* through external cues, while a pacemaker directly controls the *heart's electrical rhythm*.
