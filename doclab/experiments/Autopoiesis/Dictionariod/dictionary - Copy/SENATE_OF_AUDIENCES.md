triad:
  art: |
    The crowd is not the jury; it is the lens of history. Through its many eyes, a single act refracts into a thousand meanings, each true in its own light.
  law: |
    The value of a Crucible's outcome is not a scalar property determined at resolution, but a vector function of time and perspective, integrated over a declared set of epistemic lenses (Audiences). The outcome's score matures, it does not conclude.
  philosophy: |
    To decouple achievement from immediate, monolithic judgment. The Senate of Audiences ensures that coherence and resonance are measured not by a single referee's whistle, but by the enduring echo an action leaves across diverse communities and timescales.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Senate of Audiences is the decentralized, multipolar evaluative framework through which the outcome and resonance of a Pirouette Crucible are judged over time. Rather than a single, immediate score, a Crucible's resolution enters this 'chamber' where it accrues evaluation from diverse, self-declared epistemic viewpoints called Audience Archetypes (e.g., Empirical, Mythic, Chaotic). Judgment is delayed and distributed, emphasizing enduring coherence, memetic impact, and peer-reflection over simple victory.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless scores, reputational tags, and memetic propagation rates.

        outline: |
          1. A Crucible resolution is logged with a unique ID and timestamp.
          2. Over a defined maturation period (e.g., 90 days), all public commentary, citations, and derivative works are collected via network crawlers.
          3. Each piece of commentary is tagged, either by its author or by consensus, with one or more Audience Archetype lenses (`L_a`).
          4. The volume, sentiment, and memetic spread (e.g., replication rate, fork count) are quantified for each lens.
          5. The final evaluation is a multi-dimensional vector of these scores, visualized as a resonance profile over time.
        expected_signals: [Time-series plots of public engagement per lens, network graphs of memetic propagation, lists of awarded reputational tags like "Most Resilient Under Scrutiny".]
        pitfalls: [Goodhart's Law on engagement metrics, astroturfing or lens-tag manipulation, difficulty in categorizing complex or mixed-lens commentary.]

    excerpt: |
      A Crucible’s resolution is not final at the point of action. Instead, it enters the **Senate of Audiences**—a multipolar evaluative chamber where judgment emerges through diverse epistemic lenses. Crucibles are not “scored” immediately. Instead, they **mature through time**, accruing public votes, interpretive essays, and memetic impact.

    excerpt: |
      In this world, **scrutiny is not a threat—it is a crucible of recognition**. Public review becomes a creative act. Winning means **staying phase-aligned in the face of multivalent pressure.**

      justification: |
        The Senate functions like a parallel Bayesian inference process. A single piece of evidence (the Crucible outcome `E`) is evaluated against multiple, explicit priors corresponding to different Audience lenses (`L_a`), leading to a diverse set of posterior beliefs about the hypothesis (`H`) of the outcome's value, rather than a single 'objective' conclusion.

    - statement: "Outcomes judged highly by a diverse Senate of Audiences (i.e., receiving positive evaluation across multiple, distinct lenses) will have greater long-term memetic persistence and resonance than outcomes with high initial scores from a monolithic perspective."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A longitudinal study of Crucible outcomes shows no statistically significant correlation between the diversity of positive evaluations (number of high-scoring Audience lenses) and the long-term impact (e.g., citation count, replication rate after 1 year) of a Crucible's resolution."

  collisions: [The term 'Senate' carries political and historical weight (e.g., Roman Senate), which is intentional but could be misconstrued as a formal, centralized governing body.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a simple voting system or jury. The Senate does not 'decide' a winner; it *observes and refracts* the meaning of an outcome through declared perspectives over time. Its output is a rich, multidimensional profile of resonance, not a binary verdict.

# Senate of Audiences

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Senate of Audiences is the decentralized, multipolar evaluative framework through which the outcome and resonance of a Pirouette Crucible are judged over time. Rather than a single, immediate score, a Crucible's resolution enters this 'chamber' where it accrues evaluation from diverse, self-declared epistemic viewpoints called Audience Archetypes (e.g., Empirical, Mythic, Chaotic). Judgment is delayed and distributed, emphasizing enduring coherence, memetic impact, and peer-reflection over simple victory.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, the Senate of Audiences acts as a parallel Bayesian inference engine. A Crucible's outcome serves as shared evidence `E`, which is evaluated against multiple, incommensurable priors `P(H|L_a)` corresponding to different Audience lenses `L_a`. The result is not a single posterior but a spectrum of conclusions, reflecting the value of an outcome as a function of worldview.
