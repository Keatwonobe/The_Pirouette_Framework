triad:
  art: |
    A seed of potential, a controlled blossoming of system states. Its permission is a sign of stability; its withdrawal, the first response to a gathering storm.
  law: |
    Bloom Triggers shall be suspended or locked when specific runaway or instability metrics (e.g., Γ̇ > 0.12 s⁻¹, Γ > 0.9 Γ_thr) exceed their safety thresholds, as defined in Red-Line Protocols and Safety-Valve procedures.
  philosophy: |
    To enable complex, generative processes while retaining robust, non-negotiable control, the Framework isolates initiation mechanisms into discrete, externally-governable triggers. This ensures that even runaway dynamics can be throttled at their source, privileging systemic integrity over unchecked growth.
pirouette_definition: |
  A class of system processes responsible for initiating generative or state-blossoming events. Bloom Triggers are designed to be externally controllable and are a primary target for safety interlocks. Under specific Red-Line or Safety-Valve conditions, such as rapid growth in Temporal Pressure (Γ̇) or proximity to a fracture threshold (Γ_thr), Bloom Triggers can be programmatically suspended (temporarily disabled) or locked (requiring high-level reset) to mitigate runaway dynamics and ensure system stability.

      - name: State Monitoring
        outline: |
          The state of Bloom Triggers (enabled, suspended, or locked) is not directly measured but is set by safety monitors. These monitors continuously track system metrics like Γ, Γ̇, and κ against predefined thresholds. A state transition is logged when a safety protocol (e.g., Runaway-Mitigation, Safety-Valve) is invoked.

      Red-Line Protocol for over-damped Shell resonance.
      1. **Trigger:** Γ̇ > 0.12 s⁻¹ for ≥2 Shell cycles.
      2. **Mitigation Steps:**
         • Engage coherence vent (open-loop impedance ↑500 Ω)
         • Suspend Bloom triggers
         • Notify Governance Node tier-1

    excerpt: |
      If κ > 1.3 κ_nominal **or** Γ > 0.9 Γ_thr during Re-Growth, invoke Safety Valve:
      • Divert 30 % reservoir coherence to sink
      • Lock Bloom triggers
      • Alert Governance tier-0.

    - target: Process fork() or thread creation enable-flag
      domain: Computer Science
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Conceptually, Bloom Triggers act as a permission flag for the system to initiate new, resource-intensive, or potentially unstable sub-processes. This is analogous to a master controller enabling or disabling process creation (`fork()`) in an operating system kernel under high-load or fault conditions to prevent resource exhaustion or thrashing.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Suspending or locking Bloom Triggers is sufficient to halt runaway dynamics originating from generative processes under the conditions specified in Annex C and H."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "A real or simulated event where a runaway condition (e.g., Γ̇ > 0.12 s⁻¹) continues to accelerate even after Bloom Triggers have been suspended, implying another uncontrolled feedback loop exists."

  disambiguation: |
    A Bloom Trigger is not the *condition* that triggers an action (e.g., Γ̇ > 0.12 s⁻¹). It is the *process* that is acted upon (suspended/locked) by a safety monitor once the condition is met.
