        Threads (Geodesics): The paths that systems trace through the manifold are geodesics‚Äînot of minimal distance, but of maximal coherence. They are paths of least resistance across a landscape shaped by the past.

  art: |
    A Thread is the silver trail a system leaves on the Loom, a path sung into existence not by choosing the shortest route, but the one with the clearest note. It is the memory of a journey written into the fabric of what-is.
  law: |
    The trajectory of any system through the Coherence Manifold is the specific Thread Œ≥ that maximizes the action S = ‚à´ùìõ_p dt, where ùìõ_p is the Pirouette Lagrangian. All physical laws of motion are emergent consequences of this single variational principle.
  philosophy: |
    Threads replace the Newtonian concept of force-driven trajectories with the principle of path optimization. A system moves not because it is pushed, but because it is drawn along the path of greatest harmony with itself and its history, as encoded in the Manifold's geometry.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Thread is a world-line or trajectory traced by a system through the Coherence Manifold. It is a geodesic not of minimal distance but of maximal coherence, representing the path that maximizes the time-integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì). In high-coherence regimes, a single Thread dominates, yielding classical physics; in low-coherence regimes, a superposition of potential Threads constitutes the quantum state.

          Repeatedly measure a system's state variables (e.g., position, momentum, phase) over an interval of time. The ordered set of these states constitutes an empirical approximation of the system's Thread. Compare this observed path to the one predicted by extremizing the action ‚à´ùìõ_p dt for a given model of the local Coherence Manifold.

    excerpt: |
      The quantum world is the behavior of systems where the "path of maximal coherence" is not a single line but a smeared-out field of probabilities‚Äîa superposition of potential geodesics. An observer's interaction (CORE-010) raises the local coherence, catalyzing the collapse into a single, definite path.

    excerpt: |
      The classical world is the behavior of systems where a single geodesic is so overwhelmingly coherent that all other potential paths have effectively zero probability. Probabilities collapse into the certainty of a deterministic trajectory.

      justification: |
        In GR, a geodesic is a path that extremizes the spacetime interval. A Thread is a path that extremizes the coherence action. The Pirouette Framework posits that the latter is the more fundamental principle, from which the former emerges in specific regimes.

        The Pirouette model of a quantum state as a "superposition of potential Threads" is a direct conceptual analog to the Feynman path integral, which sums over all possible histories of a system. The Principle of Maximal Coherence acts as the selection principle, analogous to the Principle of Stationary Action, that determines the classical path.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, "Thread" is a technical term for a system's trajectory through the Coherence Manifold, analogous to a "world-line". It should not be confused with the concept of threads in concurrent computing or the fundamental objects of string theory. The alias "Geodesics" is used to emphasize its nature as an extremal path.

# Threads

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Thread is a world-line or trajectory traced by a system through the Coherence Manifold. It is a geodesic not of minimal distance but of maximal coherence, representing the path that maximizes the time-integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì). In high-coherence regimes, a single Thread dominates, yielding classical physics; in low-coherence regimes, a superposition of potential Threads constitutes the quantum state.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of quantum field theory, a Thread is analogous to a path in the Feynman path integral formalism. The low-coherence (quantum) regime is described by a superposition of all possible Threads, with each path weighted by a factor derived from its coherence action ‚à´ùìõ_p dt. In the high-coherence (classical) limit, the Principle of Maximal Coherence ensures that the system's trajectory converges to the single, stationary Thread where the action is extremized, analogous to how the classical path emerges from the Principle of Stationary Action.
