      snippet: |
        The interactive phase is governed by a single, powerful rule: *one may only speak to ask a clarifying question or to show how their own perspective connects with, strengthens, or refines another's.* Direct refutation ("You are wrong because...") is forbidden.

triad:
  art: |
    A battlefield is where two truths go to die. A crucible is where they go to be reborn as one.
  law: |
    The application of the Protocol's rules artificially raises the potential cost (V_Γ) of adversarial behavior, making collaborative synthesis the path of least action for the group by modifying the discursive potential field.
  philosophy: |
    Debate is not a battlefield where truths are broken, but a sacred arena where they are forged into something greater. The process transforms conflict into co-creation, proving that the greatest creations are woven in the sacred space between minds.
pirouette_definition: |
  A structured, five-step ritual that reframes interpersonal discourse from adversarial combat to a collaborative process of co-creation. Its purpose is to transform Turbulent or Stagnant debate into a Laminar flow state, creating the conditions for an Alchemical Union (CORE-012) of perspectives into a new, more coherent, shared understanding called a Resonant Synthesis.

        outline: |
          An observer analyzes the interaction patterns within a discourse, categorizing the state as Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant. This is done by logging interaction types (e.g., clarifying question, ad hominem, repetition) over a defined time window and comparing their frequency to baseline state definitions.
        expected_signals: [Laminar (arguments build, questions clarify), Turbulent (fallacies, interruptions, ad hominem), Stagnant (repetition of points, fixed positions)]
        pitfalls: [Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) biasing the diagnosis; misclassifying passionate but constructive argument as Turbulent.]

  - module: DOMA-127
    excerpt: |
      This module replaces the calculation of argumentative "force" with the diagnosis of discursive "flow." The goal is no longer to achieve "vector alignment" through persuasion, but to facilitate a **Resonant Synthesis**—an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) of perspectives into a new, more coherent, shared understanding. This protocol is the practical art of transforming conflict into co-creation.
  - module: DOMA-127
    excerpt: |
      This protocol is a form of social engineering designed to manipulate the coherence manifold of the debate, making it easier for participants to follow the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006) collectively. The ritual's rules—especially the ban on refutation and the shared declaration of intent—artificially raise the "cost" (`V_Γ`) of adversarial behavior. It becomes socially and procedurally "expensive."
  - module: DOMA-127
    excerpt: |
      When an impasse is reached, the moderator or participants must explicitly shift the goal. The new task is for all to cease defending their own positions and work together to define a *new* position that incorporates the most coherent elements of the conflicting views. This conscious effort to resolve the paradox is the crucible's fire.

      justification: |
        The protocol's rules act as a time-varying potential field (V_Γ) that disfavors high-energy adversarial states (turbulence) and creates a gradient descent path towards a low-energy, high-coherence ground state (synthesis). This is analogous to an annealing schedule that carefully lowers the "temperature" of a system to avoid it getting trapped in local minima (stagnation).

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from general 'moderation' or 'debate rules.' The Crucible Protocol is a specific, five-step ritual engineered to manipulate the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) of the discourse, not merely to enforce politeness. Its function is to alter the potential field of the debate itself.

# Crucible Protocol

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A structured, five-step ritual that reframes interpersonal discourse from adversarial combat to a collaborative process of co-creation. Its purpose is to transform Turbulent or Stagnant debate into a Laminar flow state, creating the conditions for an Alchemical Union (CORE-012) of perspectives into a new, more coherent, shared understanding called a Resonant Synthesis.
