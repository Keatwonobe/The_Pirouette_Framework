        With its forward temporal propagation blocked in one dimension, the proton's Wound Channel can no longer coil into a helix. To maintain its coherence, it is forced to "unroll" or extrude its temporal existence into the remaining two spatial dimensions. The result is a stable, macroscopic 2D surface—a Resonant Wall.

  art: |
    We do not build a wall to stop a fist. We build a moment in time so solid that the fist forgets it was ever thrown. It is the art of taking the universe's most perfect memory of stability and asking it to hold its pose.
  law: |
    A Resonant Wall functions as a boundary of near-infinite temporal pressure. Any interacting system must follow a trajectory of reflection, as this is the only available path that conserves its own coherence.
  philosophy: |
    The Resonant Wall demonstrates that macroscopic, indestructible structures can be engineered not by assembling matter, but by projecting and stabilizing a single, perfect quantum history into a tangible surface.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable, two-dimensional macroscopic surface of extreme temporal coherence, formed via Coherence Extrusion. It is the projected, 'unrolled' Wound Channel of a single proton whose Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`) has been locked along one geometric axis, creating a static, non-updating boundary in the coherence manifold that reflects incident particles and energy.

        outline: |
          1. Stabilize a Resonant Wall (Σ_R) at its operational temperature (4K).
          2. Illuminate a section of the Wall with a calibrated, collimated laser source (e.g., 532 nm).
          3. Measure the incident power (`P_inc`) before it strikes the Wall.
          4. Using an integrating sphere or wide-angle detector, measure the total reflected power (`P_ref`).
          5. Calculate the index `ℛ = P_ref / P_inc`.
        expected_signals: [A specularly reflected beam with power ≥ 0.92 * `P_inc`., Negligible thermal signature change on the Wall (low `S_bleed`).]
        pitfalls: [Detector misalignment causing under-measurement of reflected power., Stray light contamination., Failure to account for atmospheric absorption.]

  - module: DOMA-204
    excerpt: |
      The Resonant Wall functions as a near-perfect shield because it is a surface of extreme, static temporal coherence. An incoming particle or photon is not repelled by a classical "force," but is instead confronted with an impossible path. The Wall is a sheer cliff in the coherence manifold. An attempt to penetrate the Wall would require an infinite "cost" in coherence.

      justification: |
        Like an infinite potential barrier in quantum mechanics, the Resonant Wall presents a classically forbidden region. An incident particle's wavefunction cannot penetrate the boundary, forcing total reflection and a probability amplitude of zero within or beyond the Wall.

        Operationally, the Wall functions as a perfect mirror for electromagnetic waves. This is analogous to a PEC boundary, which enforces the condition that the tangential electric field component is zero, resulting in a reflection coefficient of 1 for all frequencies.

  disambiguation: |
    The term "Wall" is a functional metaphor, not a material description. A Resonant Wall is not a static lattice of atoms. It is a dynamic, self-stabilizing boundary condition in the coherence manifold—a 2D region where the local temporal update cycle is actively suppressed. It has no "thickness" in the conventional sense.

# Resonant Wall

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A stable, two-dimensional macroscopic surface of extreme temporal coherence, formed via Coherence Extrusion. It is the projected, 'unrolled' Wound Channel of a single proton whose Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`) has been locked along one geometric axis, creating a static, non-updating boundary in the coherence manifold that reflects incident particles and energy.

## EFT-First Summary
A Resonant Wall is a dynamically-generated, two-dimensional boundary condition that functions analogously to an **infinite potential barrier** in quantum mechanics or a **perfect electric conductor** in electromagnetism. By creating a region of spacetime where temporal evolution is locally frozen, it forces the wavefunction of any incident particle to zero at the boundary, resulting in near-perfect reflection. This is not achieved with a material substance but by engineering the local structure of the coherence manifold itself.
