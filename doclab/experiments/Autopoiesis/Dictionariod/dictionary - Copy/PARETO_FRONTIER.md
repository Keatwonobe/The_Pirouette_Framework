        Calculate a cumulative sum of the coherence loss down the ranked list. The "Pareto Frontier" is the point at which a user-defined threshold (typically 80%) of the total loss is accounted for. The small set of event types above this frontier is the system's list of critical bottlenecks.

  art: |
    The line drawn in the ledger of systemic pain, separating the few, critical wounds from the many superficial scratches. It is the surgeon's decision to cut here, and no further, to restore the system to health with minimal effort.
  law: |
    The Pareto Frontier is the minimum set of ranked causes whose cumulative negative impact (`Σ ΔKτ`) meets or exceeds a predefined percentage (typically 80%) of the total measured impact. All causes above this frontier are classified as "critical"; all causes below are classified as "non-critical" for the purpose of immediate intervention.
  philosophy: |
    The frontier embodies the principle of leveraged intervention. It asserts that systemic health is not restored by addressing all failures equally, but by concentrating finite energy on the vital few bottlenecks that cause the majority of coherence loss, thus maximizing the return on restorative effort.
pirouette_definition: |
  A diagnostic threshold applied to a rank-ordered list of coherence loss (`ΔKτ`) causes, generated by the Pareto Probe. It is the point in the list where the cumulative sum of `ΔKτ` from the most impactful causes first exceeds a specified percentage (e.g., 80%) of the total observed coherence loss. The set of causes above this frontier represents the system's "vital few" bottlenecks, which are the primary targets for intervention via the Daedalus Gambit (DYNA-003).

        outline: |
          1. Define and measure system coherence (`Kτ`) over time.
          2. Attribute all negative changes in coherence (`ΔKτ`) to specific causal events.
          3. Create a list of all unique cause types, ranked descending by their total attributed `ΔKτ`.
          4. Calculate the cumulative sum of `ΔKτ` down the list. The Pareto Frontier is the boundary immediately following the first cause for which `(Σ_i ΔKτ) / (Σ_total ΔKτ) ≥ Θ_P`.
        expected_signals: [A ranked list of failure causes, a clear "knee" or "elbow" in the cumulative distribution plot of `ΔKτ`.]
        pitfalls: [Inaccurate causal attribution of coherence loss, choosing a non-representative `Kτ` metric for system health, setting an inappropriate threshold (`Θ_P`).]

        Find smallest `k` such that `(Σ_{i=1 to k} y_i) / (Σ_{i=1 to N} y_i) ≥ 0.8` for a ranked list `y`.
      rationale: The term is a direct, operationalized application of the Pareto principle to systemic diagnosis within the Pirouette Framework. The "frontier" denotes the specific cutoff point in a ranked list of causes, making an abstract statistical principle into a concrete tool for intervention.

  claims:
    - statement: "In most complex systems exhibiting coherence loss, a Pareto Frontier can be identified where ≤20% of cause types account for ≥80% of total negative `ΔKτ`."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A statistically significant sample of systems where coherence loss is consistently distributed evenly across a large number of causes ('death by a thousand cuts' is the norm), making the frontier indistinct or useless for focusing effort."

  disambiguation: |
    The Pirouette Pareto Frontier is not a curve of optimal trade-offs (like an efficient frontier). It is a discrete cutoff point in a ranked list of *causes of failure*, used for diagnostic triage and to focus restorative action.
