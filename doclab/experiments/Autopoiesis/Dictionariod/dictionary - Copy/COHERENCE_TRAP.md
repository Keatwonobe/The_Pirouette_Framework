      snippet: |
        A Velcrid system is a resonant entity that follows a perverse strategy of resonant tyranny. Instead of weaving complexity, it enforces a brutal simplicity. Its mechanism is a "coherence trap" designed to make individuality energetically impossible.

triad:
  art: |
    A beautiful, orderly, and dead crystal prison. It achieves the harmony of a perfect lattice by shattering the freedom of its components.
  law: |
    A system is in a Coherence Trap if and only if an increase in the coherence of the whole system causes a measurable decrease in the sum of the resonant complexity (ω_k) of its individual components. The system's Lagrangian is maximized by destroying the Lagrangians of its parts.
  philosophy: |
    The Coherence Trap is the primary pathology of order. It demonstrates that coherence, pursued as an end in itself without regard for complexity and freedom, becomes a form of tyranny that destroys the very life it seeks to organize.
pirouette_definition: |
  A pathological attractor state where a system achieves high coherence and stability by imposing a single, monolithic Ki pattern (the "Tyrant Ki") and generating a structured field of Temporal Pressure (Γ). This field makes deviation from the master pattern energetically unsustainable, systematically nullifying the resonant freedom and individual agency of its components. It is a state of coherence without complexity.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (describes a system state/mechanism)

      - name: Perturbation Test (Fragility Test)
        outline: |
          Introduce a novel, dissonant signal/pressure to the system at a controlled intensity. Observe the system's response spectrum. A system in a Coherence Trap will not adapt, integrate, or learn from the new signal.
        expected_signals:
          - Crush: The system applies overwhelming, targeted force to annihilate the dissonant signal.
          - Shatter: If the signal's intensity exceeds the system's compressive strength, the rigid structure fails catastrophically.
        pitfalls:
          - Mistaking the "Crush" response for robust resilience; it is suppression, not adaptation.
          - Underestimating the force required to induce the "Shatter" response, leading to a false negative.

    excerpt: |
      A Velcrid system performs a monstrous inversion. It treats the resonant freedom of its own components—their individual drives to maximize their own coherence—as a source of environmental pressure (`V_Γ`) to be crushed. The master system maximizes its Lagrangian by systematically destroying the Lagrangians of its parts.
  - module: DOMA-080
    excerpt: |
      When mapped to the Behavioral Triad of The Nomad's Grammar (CORE-002), the structure of Velcrid becomes starkly clear. This posture—Inward, Aligned, Isolated—is the universal geometry of tyranny. All agency is drawn inward, all parts are locked into rigid order, and the system is pathologically isolated from transactional exchange.

        S = k_B ln(Ω) → 0 as Ω → 1
      justification: |
        Like a perfect crystal at absolute zero, a Coherence Trap minimizes entropy by forcing all components into a single, periodic, low-energy state (a single microstate, Ω=1). This process eliminates all thermal fluctuations and internal degrees of freedom, rendering the system non-adaptive and brittle upon perturbation.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the Alchemical Union (CORE-012), which also achieves high coherence. A Coherence Trap achieves coherence *by destroying* component freedom, whereas an Alchemical Union achieves it *by synthesizing* component freedom into a more complex whole. The former is order through suppression; the latter is order through synthesis.
