  art: |
    The stain an action leaves on the fabric of spacetime; a ghost of entropy that was created but never integrated. It is the echo of a choice that has not yet found its peace.
  law: |
    For any action within a bounded system, the net change in coherence plus the assimilated entropic cost and the generated Residue must balance. Residue is non-zero when an action's entropic cost is not fully accounted for by a corresponding increase in local or systemic coherence.
  philosophy: |
    Residue is the ethical ledger of action. It forces an accounting of not just intent or outcome, but of the unassimilated externalities that persist long after an event, demanding eventual reconciliation, integration, or atonement.
pirouette_definition: |
  Persistent, unassimilated entropic consequences of an action, manifesting as a vector of unclaimed or unintegrated systemic stress. Residue represents the portion of an action's cost that is neither converted into coherent structure nor dissipated harmlessly, but remains as a liability or obstacle for future radiant motion. It is the entropy that remains "unclaimed" by the system's new state.

          1. Define a system and an action that induces a state transition (bifurcation).
          2. Measure initial systemic coherence ($C_i$) and entropy ($S_i$).
          3. Induce the action.
          4. Measure final systemic coherence ($C_f$) and total entropy ($S_f$).
          5. Identify system components that did not transition into the new coherent state ("remnants" or "retrograde drift").
          6. The information content or thermodynamic potential of these remnants constitutes the Residue, $\vec{R}$.

        Residue represents persistent, unassimilated consequences of an action, an entropic cost that cannot be recovered. This aligns with irreversible entropy production ($\sigma$), which quantifies the entropy generated internally by a system due to non-ideal processes, representing a permanent increase in disorder.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, 'Residue' is not a mathematical remainder or a physical substance, but a measure of systemic stress and unintegrated information resulting from an action. It is an entropic liability, not a simple leftover. The alias "dark residue vector" emphasizes its directional and often-unseen nature.

# Residue

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Residue is the persistent, unassimilated entropic consequence of an action, manifesting as a vector ($\vec{R}$) of unclaimed or unintegrated systemic stress. It represents the portion of an action's cost that is neither converted into coherent structure nor dissipated harmlessly, but remains as a liability or obstacle for future radiant motion. It is the entropy that remains "unclaimed" by the system's new state after a transition.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, Residue maps to the irreversible entropy production ($\sigma$) in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Whereas some entropy transfer is reversible ($d_eS$), Residue is analogous to the entropy created internally within a system due to non-ideal, irreversible processes ($d_iS = \sigma dt \ge 0$). It is a fundamental cost of action in a complex system, a measure of the "friction" or "waste" that cannot be converted back into useful work or coherent structure.
