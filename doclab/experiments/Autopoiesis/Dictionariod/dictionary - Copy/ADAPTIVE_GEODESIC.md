    The path is not a line drawn in stone, but a living riverbed, constantly re-carved by the flow of reality to guide the waters of intent towards their sea.
  law: |
    A system maintains maximal coherence by continuously re-evaluating its trajectory (Œ≥) to maximize the action integral `S = ‚à´ùìõ_plan dt`, dynamically adjusting its path `Œ≥(t)` in response to measured changes in internal coherence (`K_œÑ`) and environmental pressure (`V_Œì`).
  philosophy: |
    Static plans are brittle prophecies; they shatter on contact with the unpredictable. An adaptive geodesic embraces reality's flux, transforming planning from a predictive act into a continuous, responsive dance with the present moment.
pirouette_definition: |
  An Adaptive Geodesic is a strategic trajectory that is not fixed in advance but is continuously recalculated in real-time to maintain maximal coherence. It is the operational process of dynamically adjusting a plan's path (`Œ≥(t)`) to maximize the action integral `S[Œ≥] = ‚à´ùìõ_plan(Œ≥, Œ≥Ãá, t) dt`, where the Lagrangian `ùìõ_plan` is a function of the system's internal coherence (`K_œÑ`) and the ambient Environmental Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`). This process, known as the Weaver's Protocol, aims to sustain a state of Laminar Execution by treating the plan as a living hypothesis subject to constant revision.

          A continuous three-step feedback loop:
          1. **Assess Pattern:** Audit internal coherence (`K_œÑ`) via metrics like project velocity, team alignment surveys, and logical consistency checks.
          2. **Assess Landscape:** Monitor environmental pressure (`V_Œì`) using market volatility indices, competitor analysis, and resource availability dashboards.
          3. **Recalibrate Geodesic:** Re-solve for the path `Œ≥*(t)` that maximizes `‚à´(K_œÑ - V_Œì) dt` and adjust execution priorities and resource allocation accordingly.

    excerpt: |
      The most profound shift is from viewing a plan as a noun to understanding planning as a verb. A static plan is a fragile thing. A truly resilient strategy is an **adaptive geodesic**‚Äîa continuous process of sensing changes in the environmental pressure (V_Œì) and re-calculating the path of maximal coherence in real time. This re-frames the "review cycle" into a living feedback loop. The goal is not to adhere to the original plan, but to adhere to the *principle of maximal coherence*, dynamically adjusting the path to maintain a state of Laminar Flow.
  - module: DOMA-162
    excerpt: |
      **Turbulent Execution:** The plan is misaligned with the true geodesic of the environment. Execution is chaotic, characterized by constant crises, wasted energy, and "firefighting." The plan's signal is being drowned out by environmental noise (high V_Œì) or its own internal dissonance (low K_œÑ).
      **Stagnant Execution:** The plan is too rigid or flawed to navigate an unforeseen obstacle. Progress has halted. This is a **"Coherence Dam"**‚Äîa critical bottleneck or false assumption that has terminated the geodesic.

        The core of an adaptive geodesic is sequential, real-time decision-making to optimize a long-term objective (maximal coherence). This mirrors the structure of dynamic programming, where an optimal policy is built by finding the best action at the current state, considering the value of optimally-managed future states. The "recalibration" step is analogous to solving the Bellman equation at each time step.

        The framework explicitly uses a Lagrangian (`ùìõ_plan`) and the maximization of its time integral to define the optimal path. This is a direct conceptual parallel to the Principle of Least Action in classical mechanics, which determines the trajectory of a physical system. The "adaptive" nature modifies this by allowing the landscape (and thus L) to change over time.

    Distinguish from a static `Geodesic`. A static geodesic is a single path calculated once based on initial conditions. An Adaptive Geodesic is a *policy* for generating a path over time, where the path itself is subject to continuous change as the underlying "manifold" of environmental pressure shifts.

# Adaptive Geodesic

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An Adaptive Geodesic is a strategic trajectory that is not fixed in advance but is continuously recalculated in real-time to maintain maximal coherence. It is the operational process of dynamically adjusting a plan's path (`Œ≥(t)`) to maximize the action integral `S[Œ≥] = ‚à´ùìõ_plan(Œ≥, Œ≥Ãá, t) dt`, where the Lagrangian `ùìõ_plan` is a function of the system's internal coherence (`K_œÑ`) and the ambient Environmental Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`). This process, known as the Weaver's Protocol, aims to sustain a state of Laminar Execution by treating the plan as a living hypothesis subject to constant revision.

## EFT-First Summary
The concept maps closely to optimal control theory and dynamic programming. An Adaptive Geodesic is analogous to an optimal control policy that seeks to maximize a value function (total coherence) over time. At each step, the system re-evaluates its state and the "cost-to-go" landscape, choosing the action that optimizes the path forward, mirroring the logic of the Bellman equation. This reframes strategic execution from following a pre-calculated trajectory (a classical mechanics solution) to a continuous, state-aware optimization process.
