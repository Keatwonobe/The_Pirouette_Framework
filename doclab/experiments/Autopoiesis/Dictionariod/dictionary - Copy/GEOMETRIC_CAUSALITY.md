    The past is not a story; it is a landscape we inhabit. Every action carves a groove into this terrain, a path that guides all who follow.
  law: |
    An entity's trajectory is a geodesic on a coherence manifold whose geometry is dynamically sculpted by the Wound Channels of its own and others' histories. Influence is the measurable deviation from a null geodesic caused by this historical geometry.
  philosophy: |
    This principle replaces statistical correlation with physical mechanism, unifying memory, inertia, and interaction into a single geometric framework. It asserts that there are no innocent actions, only acts of weaving the tapestry of reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  The principle that an entity's history, encoded as a geometric structure called a Wound Channel, physically modifies the local coherence manifold. This modification alters the Temporal Pressure potential (V_Œì), thereby sculpting the landscape of possible futures. An entity's subsequent path, by obeying the Principle of Maximal Coherence, is a geodesic on this historically-defined landscape, manifesting as inertia, guidance, or resonance.

          1. Calculate the null geodesic for a target system in an unperturbed, ambient coherence manifold.
          2. Introduce a Wound Channel (the influence source) into the manifold's model.
          3. Observe the system's actual trajectory.
          4. The Geodesic Deviation (Œ¥G) is the integrated difference between the observed trajectory and the calculated null geodesic.

    excerpt: |
      The past is not a story we tell; it is a landscape we inhabit. Every event, from the pirouette of an electron to the birth of a star, leaves a geometric scar on the fabric of reality. ... It reframes the passive concept of "correlation" into the active, physical principle of **geometric causality**. An entity's path is not a series of independent moments but a continuous navigation of a terrain shaped by the echoes of its own and others' histories.

    excerpt: |
      The Loom of Causality is a direct consequence of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`. A Wound Channel is not an abstract concept; it is a persistent, local modification to the **Temporal Pressure (V_Œì)** term. ... The "force" of influence is therefore revealed to be the gradient of this potential (`-‚àáV_Œì,channel`), which emerges when applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to `ùìõ_p`.

      justification: |
        Geometric Causality posits that history alters a potential field (V_Œì,channel), causing a body to follow a new geodesic. This is analogous to how, in General Relativity, mass-energy curves spacetime (altering the metric potential), causing objects to follow geodesics we perceive as orbits. It is a geometrization of a force-like influence.

      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observing that the influence exerted by a Wound Channel changes in response to real-time changes at its source event, faster than a signal could propagate from the source to the channel. This would imply the 'memory' is not a static local geometric feature but an active, non-local connection."

  disambiguation: |
    Geometric Causality does not violate standard causality. It is a mechanism describing *how* a past cause, operating within its light cone, exerts a persistent, local influence on future events by physically structuring the medium of interaction (the coherence manifold).

# Geometric Causality

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The principle that an entity's history, encoded as a geometric structure called a Wound Channel, physically modifies the local coherence manifold. This modification alters the Temporal Pressure potential (V_Œì), thereby sculpting the landscape of possible futures. An entity's subsequent path, by obeying the Principle of Maximal Coherence, is a geodesic on this historically-defined landscape, manifesting as inertia, guidance, or resonance.

## EFT-First Summary
Geometric Causality can be understood as an extension of the principle of least action, where the background potential is modified by historical events. Similar to how mass curves spacetime in General Relativity, a "Wound Channel"‚Äîthe trace of a past event‚Äîadds a potential energy term `V_channel` to the local Lagrangian. An entity's path is then a geodesic through this composite potential landscape, providing a physical, geometric mechanism for effects like inertia and historical influence.
