        Step I: Define the State Space. Identify the key parameters or variables (S) that define the system's configuration. This creates a multi-dimensional space where every point represents one possible state of being for the system.

  art: |
    The state space is the cartographer's canvas, a map where every coordinate marks a unique way for the system to be, from its most awkward posture to its most perfect form.
  law: |
    The state space S is the set of all N-tuples (s_1, ..., s_N) that completely specify a system's configuration; the Pirouette Lagrangian ùìõ_p(S) is a single-valued scalar field defined over this space.
  philosophy: |
    The state space establishes the formal boundaries of a system's identity. By defining its dimensions, we declare which variables matter, framing the very arena in which the system's evolution toward coherence can be charted and understood.
pirouette_definition: |
  The N-dimensional manifold, denoted S, where each coordinate axis corresponds to a degree of freedom necessary to fully describe a system's configuration. Every point s ‚àà S represents a unique, instantaneous state of the system, and serves as the domain for the Pirouette Lagrangian ùìõ_p(S).

        outline: |
          1. Identify the minimal set of independent variables (degrees of freedom) that fully characterize the system's configuration.
          2. Define the valid range (min/max) for each variable.
          3. The state space is the Cartesian product of these variable ranges.
        expected_signals: [A well-defined dimensionality (N), Bounded or unbounded ranges for each dimension]
        pitfalls: [Under-specification (missing key variables, leading to a projected, inaccurate landscape), Over-specification (including redundant variables, increasing computational cost without adding information)]

    excerpt: |
      The Coherence Landscape is a scalar field defined over a system's state space, where the "elevation" at any point is the value of the Lagrangian itself: Elevation = ùìõ_p(S) = K_œÑ(S) - V_Œì(S).

        S ‚âà {q_i}
      justification: |
        In classical mechanics, configuration space is the space of all possible positions {q_i} that a system can achieve. The Pirouette State Space generalizes this to include any relevant variable, but the core concept of a space of all possible system configurations is identical.

    - target: Phase Space
      domain: CM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      equation_hint: |
        S ‚âà {q_i, p_i}
      justification: |
        Phase space explicitly includes both position {q_i} and momentum {p_i} variables. If the Pirouette State Space S is defined to include generalized momenta or other rates of change, it becomes directly analogous to classical phase space.
      references: []
      confidence: 0.8
  adopted:
    - target: Configuration Space / Phase Space
      rationale: The term 'State Space' is used to encompass both concepts. In cases where only static parameters define the system, it maps to Configuration Space. When dynamical variables (e.g., momenta) are included as axes, it maps to Phase Space.

  claims:
    - statement: "For any system describable by the Pirouette Framework, a state space S exists over which a single-valued Coherence Landscape ùìõ_p(S) can be constructed."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "Discovering a Pirouette-compliant system whose state cannot be represented by a point in a manifold, or for which ùìõ_p(S) is multi-valued at a single point s, would invalidate this construct."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [S (entropy in thermodynamics)]
  disambiguation: |
    The symbol S for State Space should be distinguished from its use for entropy in classical and statistical thermodynamics. Within the Pirouette Framework, S refers to the manifold of system configurations, while entropy-like concepts are typically embedded within the V_Œì (Temporal Pressure) term of the Lagrangian.
