  art: |
    This is the engine that renders the invisible cost of friction into a visible debt. It is the moment of translation, turning the raw whisper of a system's heartbeat into a clear, cold number.
  law: |
    The layer shall apply the Entropic Flux equation, Ṡ ∝ Γ ⋅ (1 - Tₐ) ⋅ (Δωₖ)², to the signal from the Sensing Layer. It must output a continuous, real-time measure of coherence loss in Coherence Loss Units per second (CLU/s).
  philosophy: |
    To transform diagnosis from a qualitative art into a quantitative science. By giving chaos a number, this layer enforces accountability, making it impossible to ignore the real-world cost of inefficiency and incoherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The functional layer of the Coherence Ledger instrument responsible for processing the raw signal from the Sensing Layer (The Probe) and calculating the instantaneous rate of coherence loss (Entropic Flux, Ṡ). It applies the canonical flux equation to quantify a system's deviation from laminar flow, translating operational dissonance into a single, unambiguous metric. It also integrates this flux over time to determine cumulative entropy (S) for an audit period.
operational_definition:
  units: Input is a time-series signal (e.g., phase, voltage, frequency). Output is in `CLU/s` (Coherence Loss Units per second), equivalent to Joules/second or Watts.

        outline: |
          1. Continuously receive the raw signal stream from the Sensing Layer.
          2. Buffer and process the signal to extract key parameters: Temporal Adherence (Tₐ) and Temporal Friction (Δωₖ).
          3. Receive or infer the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).
          4. Apply the equation Ṡ = k ⋅ Γ ⋅ (1 - Tₐ) ⋅ (Δωₖ)², where k is a system-specific calibration constant, to compute instantaneous Ṡ.
          5. Output the Ṡ stream to the Attestation Layer.
        expected_signals: [A continuous stream of floating-point values representing Ṡ.]
        pitfalls: [Calibration error (incorrect k), Signal processing artifacts, Latency between sensing and computation.]

      justification: |
        The Computation Layer performs a well-defined mathematical transformation on an input signal stream (from the Sensing Layer) to produce a meaningful output metric (Entropic Flux). This is functionally identical to a DSP executing a filtering or analysis algorithm, or a control system's state estimator (like a Kalman filter) calculating a hidden state value from sensor inputs.

    Distinguish from the *Sensing Layer*, which acquires the raw signal, and the *Attestation Layer*, which records the computed output. The Computation Layer is the active translator between raw data and a meaningful, physical metric.
