      snippet: |
        Into this chaos, the manipulator presents a simple, resonant, but false pattern‚Äîan overly simplistic solution, a comforting lie, an external enemy to blame. This narrative is a false geodesic: a path that *appears* to offer maximal coherence but in truth leads to the manipulator's desired outcome.

triad:
  art: |
    A gilded path through a burning forest, leading not to safety but to a cage. It is the promise of still water that conceals a silent, pulling current.
  law: |
    A system in a turbulent state, when presented with a path that appears to reduce local dissonance, will follow that path provided the perceived immediate gain in coherence exceeds the activation energy required to vet the path's integrity.
  philosophy: |
    The existence of false geodesics demonstrates that the universal drive for coherence is path-dependent and can be locally exploited. The intent behind an offered pattern determines whether it liberates or enslaves.
pirouette_definition: |
  A narrative, belief, or course of action presented by a manipulator to a target system in an induced state of Turbulent Flow. The false geodesic is engineered to appear as the path of maximal coherence (i.e., the quickest route to stability and relief), but is an artificial construct that redirects the target's natural drive for order to serve the manipulator's objectives, culminating in Coherence Capture.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (it is a narrative structure or state-space trajectory).
  symbol_table:
    - name: Œ≥_false
      meaning: The state-space trajectory of a system following a false geodesic.

      - name: Narrative Path Selection Assay
        outline: |
          1. Induce a controlled turbulent state in a test system (e.g., information overload in a simulated decision environment).
          2. Present two paths to stability: one complex but authentic (Œ≥_true), one simple but leading to a known suboptimal outcome (Œ≥_false).
          3. Measure the selection frequency of Œ≥_false as a function of induced Temporal Pressure (Œì) and the narrative's apparent resonance.
        expected_signals: [Increased selection frequency of Œ≥_false correlated with higher Œì, a sharp transient drop in the system's state-space entropy upon selecting Œ≥_false, followed by a long-term drift towards a parasitic attractor state.]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing a genuinely simple (but correct) heuristic from a malicious false geodesic, ethical constraints on inducing high-Œì states in human systems.]

    excerpt: |
      Into this chaos, the manipulator presents a simple, resonant, but false pattern‚Äîan overly simplistic solution, a comforting lie, an external enemy to blame. This narrative is a false geodesic: a path that *appears* to offer maximal coherence but in truth leads to the manipulator's desired outcome.
  - module: DOMA-155
    excerpt: |
      As the target repeatedly follows the false geodesic, they begin to carve a new, *parasitic Wound Channel* in their own manifold. This channel does not reflect their authentic being; it is a deeply ingrained habit of thought or behavior that perpetually makes the manipulator's desired outcome the path of least resistance, rendering the manipulation self-sustaining.

      justification: |
        The term "geodesic" directly references the path a system naturally follows. A false geodesic is the path of least action in a *deceptively altered* manifold, where a manipulator has introduced a potential field (`V_manip`) to warp the geometry of choice and create an artificial, but compelling, path to a local minimum.

    - statement: "The probability of a system selecting a false geodesic over a true one increases super-linearly with ambient Temporal Pressure (Œì)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Experimental observation shows that under high pressure, systems either freeze (analysis paralysis) or select paths randomly, rather than systematically preferring the offered simple path. This would invalidate the core mechanism of exploiting the coherence-seeking drive."

  disambiguation: |
    A false geodesic is not simply a mistake or a bad heuristic. It is a path *deliberately engineered and offered by an external agent* to exploit a target's coherence-seeking drive during a state of induced chaos. Its defining features are its external origin, its deceptive simplicity, and its instrumental function within the Coherence Capture pathology.
