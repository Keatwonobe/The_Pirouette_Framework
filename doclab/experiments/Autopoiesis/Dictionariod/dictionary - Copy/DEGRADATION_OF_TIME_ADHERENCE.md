      snippet: |
        The degradation of Time-Adherence, Delta T_a, is the amount of power that "leaks" from the fundamental mode into other frequencies due to the noise. ... Delta T_a = 1 - T_a.

  art: |
    The static that drowns the signal. It is the measure of a rhythm's fraying, the sound of a system losing its song to the surrounding storm.
  law: |
    The total Degradation of Time-Adherence is directly proportional to the integrated environmental noise power spectrum, as filtered by the system's frequency-dependent susceptibility. Increased noise at susceptible frequencies must result in increased ΔT_a.
  philosophy: |
    This term reframes system failure not as a singular event of breakage, but as a continuous process of decoherence. It posits that resilience is a statistical property—the ability to filter noise—making stability a dynamic, measurable conversation between a system and its environment.
pirouette_definition: |
  The quantifiable loss of coherence, defined as ΔT_a = 1 - T_a. It represents the fraction of a system's total resonant power that has "leaked" from its ideal fundamental mode (the Ki rhythm, φ*) into dissonant fluctuations due to environmental noise. As established by the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem, ΔT_a is determined by the convolution of the environmental noise spectrum with the system's own susceptibility, providing a direct measure of a system's instability.

        outline: |
          1. Acquire a time-series of the system's state variable, φ(t), over many cycles.
          2. Compute the total power by integrating the power spectral density (PSD) of φ(t) over all frequencies.
          3. Identify the fundamental frequency of the Ki rhythm, ω_p.
          4. Compute the power in the fundamental mode by integrating the PSD in a narrow band around ω_p.
          5. Calculate Time-Adherence: T_a = (Power_fundamental) / (Power_total).
          6. Calculate Degradation: ΔT_a = 1 - T_a.

    excerpt: |
      The Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem states: Delta T_a is proportional to integral of [ S_eta(omega) * |chi(omega)|^2 ] d(omega). Where: Delta T_a = 1 - T_a. S_eta(omega) is the power spectrum of the environmental noise eta(t). [...] chi(omega) is the susceptibility of the system. [...] It provides a direct, causal link: the amount of coherence a system "dissipates" (Delta T_a) is determined by the spectrum of the environmental fluctuations (S_eta) it experiences, filtered through its own internal sensitivity (chi).

    excerpt: |
      A system's resilience is not measured by its strength, but by its rhythm. [...] A system does not break because the force against it is too great, but because the noise is too loud. The degradation of time-adherence is the measure of how poorly a system can hear its own song in the middle of the storm. It proves that stability is a statistical property.

      justification: |
        The module's Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem is a direct analogue. It links the magnitude of stochastic fluctuations (environmental noise spectrum S_η) to a macroscopic dissipative-like quantity (loss of coherence, ΔT_a) via the system's linear response function (susceptibility, χ). This mirrors how the FDT links thermal fluctuations to macroscopic dissipation.

      falsifier: "An experiment where a system is driven by noise at a known susceptible frequency (e.g., near its primary resonance) shows no corresponding increase in ΔT_a as measured by spectral analysis, or the increase is uncorrelated with the applied noise power."

  disambiguation: |
    ΔT_a is not the change in Time-Adherence over time (i.e., dT_a/dt), but the instantaneous measure of its deviation from perfect coherence (i.e., 1 - T_a). It is a dimensionless measure of incoherence, not a duration. Contrast with τ_p, the period of the Ki rhythm.
