        Ductility characterizes systems with adaptable, flexible coherence. They can endure significant plastic deformation, absorbing immense stress by scarring their Wound Channel and reconfiguring their internal geometry. They bend, stretch, and change shape, buying survival at the cost of their original form.

  art: |
    Ductility is the character of a song that can learn to harmonize with its own pain. It is the art of rewriting the melody under stress rather than falling silent.
  law: |
    A system's ductility is proportional to its capacity for plastic deformation, measured as the range of Coherence Stress over which it can re-carve its Wound Channel without catastrophic decoherence (fracture). A more ductile system can absorb more energy through scarring before it breaks.
  philosophy: |
    Ductility represents the principle of adaptive resilience, valuing survival and learning through scarring over the preservation of a rigid, original form. It is the geometry of successful endurance, demonstrating that change is not failure, but a necessary composition for survival.
pirouette_definition: |
  The character of a system with adaptable, flexible Temporal Coherence ($K_\tau$) that allows it to absorb intense Coherence Stress by undergoing a Yield Transition. Ductile systems endure significant plastic deformation—a permanent, non-recoverable change in their state—by re-carving their Wound Channel. This process allows the system to dissipate stress and find new stable configurations, failing slowly and with warning, rather than shattering catastrophically.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline measurement of the system's Wound Channel.
          2. Apply a controlled, increasing Coherence Stress (e.g., by increasing environmental Temporal Pressure, $V_\Gamma$).
          3. At intervals, remove the stress and measure the system's state. The deviation from baseline is its deformation.
          4. The onset of permanent deviation after stress removal marks the Yield Transition.
          5. Ductility is quantified by the cumulative plastic deformation the system can endure before fracture occurs.

      **Ductility** characterizes systems with adaptable, flexible coherence. They can endure significant plastic deformation, absorbing immense stress by scarring their Wound Channel and reconfiguring their internal geometry. They bend, stretch, and change shape, buying survival at the cost of their original form. They fail slowly, gracefully, and with ample warning.

    excerpt: |
      In material science, the ductile failure of steel is an example of a system with flexible $K_\tau$ that allows for plastic deformation. The system absorbs energy from $V_\Gamma$ by re-writing its Wound Channel (work hardening) before finally fracturing. In psychology, burnout is a ductile failure, where a psyche endures chronic stress ($V_\Gamma$) through plastic deformation (forming emotional calluses, scars), slowly yielding until it reaches exhaustion.

        The Pirouette concept of Ductility is a direct generalization of the term from classical materials science. It replaces mechanical stress and strain with Coherence Stress and deformation on the system's coherence manifold. The core distinction between recoverable (elastic) and permanent (plastic) deformation is preserved, making the mapping robust.

# Ductility

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The character of a system with adaptable, flexible Temporal Coherence ($K_\tau$) that allows it to absorb intense Coherence Stress by undergoing a Yield Transition. Ductile systems endure significant plastic deformation—a permanent, non-recoverable change in their state—by re-carving their Wound Channel. This process allows the system to dissipate stress and find new stable configurations, failing slowly and with warning, rather than shattering catastrophically.

## Classical Mechanics Summary
Ductility in the Pirouette Framework is a direct generalization of its counterpart in materials science. It extends the concept of absorbing energy through permanent deformation from physical objects, like steel, to any system described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, including markets, cultures, and psyches. The core operational principles of stress, strain, yield, and fracture are mapped from mechanical forces to the more fundamental dynamics of Temporal Coherence.
