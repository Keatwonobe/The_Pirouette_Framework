    The interference fringes in the song of time. When two generational notes are played, their overlap creates a slow or fast 'wobble'—a beat—that manifests as the observed mixing between particle families.
  law: |
    The mixing angle between two generational harmonics, `i` and `j`, is inversely proportional to the absolute difference of their harmonic numbers: `θ_ij ∝ 1 / |n_i - n_j|`. Large mixing requires near-degenerate harmonics; small mixing requires widely spaced harmonics.
  philosophy: |
    Mode Beating recasts flavor mixing from an empirical set of arbitrary coupling constants into a deterministic, geometric consequence of temporal wave mechanics. It provides a physical origin for the observed hierarchy in mixing angles, unifying it with the mass hierarchy under the single principle of harmonic resonance.
pirouette_definition: |
  The causal mechanism for flavor mixing, where the interference between two distinct generational standing waves (temporal harmonics `ψ_i(t)` and `ψ_j(t)`) produces a beat frequency. The time-averaged amplitude of this beat pattern determines the mixing angle `θ_ij`. The resulting mixing strength is inversely proportional to the separation of the harmonic numbers (`|n_i - n_j|`), naturally explaining the large mixing in the near-degenerate neutrino sector and the small mixing in the widely-spaced quark sector.

          1. Measure the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos (e.g., DUNE) and the decay rates of heavy quarks (e.g., LHCb) to extract the elements of the PMNS and CKM matrices.
          2. Calculate the mixing angles `θ_12`, `θ_23`, `θ_13` for both sectors.
          3. Test if the observed hierarchy of angles scales inversely with the generational separation `|n_i - n_j|`.

        pitfalls: [Complex phase contributions (CP violation) can obscure the direct scaling relationship., Higher-order corrections from Higgs coupling (`ε_n`) may slightly alter the harmonic frequencies, affecting the beat pattern.]

    excerpt: |
      Mixing between generations arises from **beating** between nearby temporal harmonics. Thus, large mixing (ν sector) corresponds to near-degenerate harmonics (slow beat), while small mixing (quarks) reflects widely spaced harmonics (fast beat average → 0). This naturally yields the observed hierarchy of CKM ≪ PMNS mixing.
  - module: MATH-Γ-006
    excerpt: |
      A key falsifiable consequence of the harmonic quantization model is the prediction of mixing angle scaling, where `θ_ij ∝ 1/|n_i - n_j|`. This provides a direct, testable link between the mass hierarchy (driven by `n^2`) and the mixing hierarchy. This pattern can be checked against global fits from experiments like T2K, DUNE, and Belle II.

        Mode Beating is proposed as the physical mechanism that generates the numerical values of the Standard Model's CKM and PMNS matrix elements. Instead of being fundamental inputs, these mixing angles are emergent properties of the interference between temporal harmonics corresponding to fermion generations.

    In Pirouette, 'Mode Beating' refers specifically to the interference of *temporal* harmonics that define fermion generations, not spatial modes or other common wave phenomena. The 'modes' are the quantized solutions `ψ_n` to the temporal Helmholtz equation.

# Mode Beating

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The causal mechanism for flavor mixing, where the interference between two distinct generational standing waves (temporal harmonics `ψ_i(t)` and `ψ_j(t)`) produces a beat frequency. The time-averaged amplitude of this beat pattern determines the mixing angle `θ_ij`. The resulting mixing strength is inversely proportional to the separation of the harmonic numbers (`|n_i - n_j|`), naturally explaining the large mixing in the near-degenerate neutrino sector and the small mixing in the widely-spaced quark sector.

## EFT-First Summary
In Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), the CKM and PMNS matrices are input parameters describing flavor violation. Mode Beating provides a potential UV-complete origin for these matrices, positing that their hierarchical structure arises from the beat frequencies of underlying temporal wavefunctions, with mixing angles `θ_ij` scaling as `1/|n_i-n_j|`, where `n` is the generation number.
