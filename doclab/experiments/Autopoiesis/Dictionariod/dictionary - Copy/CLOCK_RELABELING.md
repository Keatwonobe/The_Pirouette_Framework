        **SR-1 — Clock Relabeling → Gauge**
        Local phase relabeling of θ is a redundancy.
        Making it local induces a connection:
        - U(1) = single-clock gauge,
        - SU(2), SU(3) = local relabelings of degenerate temporal frames.

    The universe doesn't care what time it is on any single clock, only that all clocks tick in step. Forces are the messengers ensuring this local agreement, the very grammar of their synchrony.
  law: |
    The physical action must be invariant under a local, arbitrary re-zeroing of the temporal order parameter's phase, θ(x) → θ(x) + α(x). This invariance mandates the existence of a connection field (a gauge boson) to absorb the phase gradient ∂μ α(x).
  philosophy: |
    This principle elevates a mere redundancy—the absolute phase of a clock is meaningless—into the generative engine of all fundamental interactions. It recasts forces not as externally imposed phenomena, but as the necessary consequence of maintaining a coherent temporal fabric.
pirouette_definition: |
  The foundational principle (SR-1) stating that the physics of the temporal medium is invariant under local relabeling of the order parameter phase, θ(x). To preserve this invariance, a connection field must be introduced to compensate for the phase gradient. This mechanism generates all gauge forces: U(1) from single-clock relabeling, and SU(2)/SU(3) from relabeling degenerate temporal frames.

          This principle is not measured directly but is confirmed by its consequences. The procedure involves verifying the existence and properties of the gauge bosons predicted to arise from it. Experiments in particle accelerators (e.g., LHC, LEP) confirm the properties of photons, W/Z bosons, and gluons, whose interactions are dictated by the gauge symmetries U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) respectively.

        Clock Relabeling is the Pirouette Framework's physical re-interpretation of the mathematical principle of local gauge invariance. The local rotation of the order parameter phase θ(x) is mathematically identical to the local U(1) phase rotation of a complex field in QED. The requirement of invariance under this local transformation necessitates the introduction of a connection field (gauge field), giving rise to the interaction.

    "Clock" here refers specifically to the internal phase, θ, of the temporal medium's order parameter, not a device or a spacetime coordinate. "Relabeling" highlights the arbitrary nature of the local phase zero-point, analogous to choosing a different "12 o'clock" at every point in spacetime without physical consequence.

# Clock Relabeling

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The foundational principle (SR-1) stating that the physics of the temporal medium is invariant under local relabeling of the order parameter phase, θ(x). To preserve this invariance, a connection field must be introduced to compensate for the phase gradient. This mechanism generates all gauge forces: U(1) from single-clock relabeling, and SU(2)/SU(3) from relabeling degenerate temporal frames.

## EFT-First Summary
Clock Relabeling is the Pirouette Framework's physical basis for the principle of **local gauge invariance** in quantum field theory. The requirement that physics be unchanged by a local re-zeroing of the order parameter's phase `θ(x)` is equivalent to demanding invariance under a local `U(1)` (or `SU(N)`) transformation. This forces the introduction of covariant derivatives and their associated gauge bosons (e.g., the photon), which mediate the fundamental forces of the Standard Model.
