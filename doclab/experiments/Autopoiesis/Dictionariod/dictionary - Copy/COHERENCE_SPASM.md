        A system becomes trapped in a state of **Stagnant Flow** (`DYNA-001`). A "coherence dam"—a rigid belief, a structural bottleneck, a repressed trauma, a physical constraint—blocks its natural geodesic. The system may appear stable and highly coherent (*high $T_a$*), but it is a brittle stability. Behind this dam, the unmoving current causes Temporal Pressure (Γ) to accumulate relentlessly.

  art: |
    We mistake stillness for peace. But to be trapped is to accumulate the power to be free. A spasm is not a pathology; it is the violent and sacred geometry of a breakthrough.
  law: |
    A system constrained in a suboptimal state of Stagnant Flow will accumulate Temporal Pressure (Γ). When Γ exceeds the integrity of the constraint (the coherence dam), the system will undergo a catastrophic phase transition into extreme Turbulent Flow, violently releasing the pressure.
  philosophy: |
    The Coherence Spasm is the universe's guarantee that no prison is permanent. It reframes catastrophic change not as a failure, but as a necessary, high-risk mechanism for escaping local optima, ensuring that all systems retain the potential for transformation.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Coherence Spasm is a catastrophic, three-act phase transition by which a system escapes a suboptimal equilibrium. Act I involves accumulating Temporal Pressure (Γ) while trapped in Stagnant Flow behind a "coherence dam." Act II is the spasm itself: a violent, instantaneous fracture of the dam and transition into extreme Turbulent Flow. Act III is the re-coalescence, where the system settles into a new state that can be transformative, restorative, or degenerative.

        outline: |
          1. Identify a system constraint (the "coherence dam").
          2. Monitor metrics "upstream" of the constraint for rising volatility, stress, or stored potential (e.g., economic inequality, repressed emotional energy, physical tension). This indicates increasing Γ.
          3. Monitor the system globally for an increase in "micro-fractures"—small, localized bursts of turbulence (e.g., market jitters, muscle twitches, social protests).
          4. Perturb the system and measure its response. A decrease in compliance and an increase in rigidity is a critical indicator of an impending spasm.

    excerpt: |
      A "coherence dam"—a rigid belief, a structural bottleneck, a repressed trauma, a physical constraint—blocks a system's natural geodesic. The system may appear stable and highly coherent, but it is a brittle stability. Behind this dam, Temporal Pressure (Γ) accumulates relentlessly. This is the system's "stored potential energy," the rising water level of unresolved tension.
  - module: DOMA-178
    excerpt: |
      This dynamic is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The initial stagnant state is a *local* maximum of the Lagrangian—a stable, but suboptimal, coherence well. A spasm is a high-cost, high-risk strategy to escape this trap... a violent "tunneling" event on the coherence manifold—the price a system pays for the chance to find a more graceful existence.

      justification: |
        Catastrophe theory mathematically describes how a system's state (x) can undergo sudden, discontinuous jumps in response to smooth changes in control parameters (a, b). The buildup of Temporal Pressure (Γ) is a smooth change in a control parameter that deforms a potential landscape, eventually annihilating the local minimum representing the stagnant state and causing a catastrophic jump.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, "Coherence Spasm" is a universal dynamics term, not restricted to biological contexts. A muscle spasm is one concrete manifestation of the abstract process. The term describes the general pattern of violent release from a state of constrained, brittle stability, applicable to social, economic, psychological, and physical systems.

# Coherence Spasm

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Coherence Spasm is a catastrophic, three-act phase transition by which a system escapes a suboptimal equilibrium. Act I involves accumulating Temporal Pressure (Γ) while trapped in Stagnant Flow behind a "coherence dam." Act II is the spasm itself: a violent, instantaneous fracture of the dam and transition into extreme Turbulent Flow. Act III is the re-coalescence, where the system settles into a new state that can be transformative, restorative, or degenerative.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Spasm is modeled as a **cusp catastrophe** from dynamical systems theory. A system state variable (e.g., Time Adherence) is governed by a potential function with two local minima representing stagnant vs. potential new states. As a control parameter analogous to Temporal Pressure (Γ) smoothly increases, it deforms this potential landscape, eventually eliminating the energy barrier that defines the stagnant state. This forces a sudden, discontinuous jump—the spasm—to a new equilibrium.
