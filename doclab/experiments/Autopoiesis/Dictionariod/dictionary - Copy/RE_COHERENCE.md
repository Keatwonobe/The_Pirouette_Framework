        3. Re-Coherence: Guided by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, the system "snaps" into a new, stable Ki pattern. If the stir was successful, this new state is a synthesis, an `Alchemical Union` (`CORE-012`) of the system's core identity with new information.

    After the storm, the landscape is rearranged, and the river finds its new, truer course to the sea. The final quiet is not an end, but a new and more profound beginning.
  law: |
    Following a sufficient Destabilization and Exploration phase, a system will spontaneously transition to the Ki pattern that maximizes coherence within its newly accessible state space. The resulting state's complexity and resilience will be greater than or equal to the initial state.
  philosophy: |
    Re-Coherence is the evidence that chaos can be productive and that disruption is not an end but a means to a more integrated, resilient existence. It is the framework's justification for embracing necessary crises, the promised synthesis that makes the crucible worthwhile.

  The third and final phase of the Stirring process, wherein a system, having undergone Destabilization and Exploration, spontaneously transitions (`snaps`) into a new, stable Ki pattern. This new state is a synthesis (`Alchemical Union`, `CORE-012`) that integrates the system's core identity with information gained during the turbulent phase, resulting in a configuration with higher complexity, resilience, and coherence than its pre-stirred state.

        outline: |
          Monitor system state variables (e.g., Ki pattern harmonics, information entropy, state-space variance) following a Stirring event. Re-Coherence is marked by a sharp decrease in variance and entropy as the system locks into a new, stable, low-energy configuration. The moment of transition is the point of maximal negative change in system entropy.

        pitfalls: [Mistaking a temporary pause in a chaotic trajectory for a final stable state, system dissolution/shattering which prevents any Re-Coherence]

    excerpt: |
      A successful stir unfolds in three distinct phases: 1. Destabilization, where the old Ki pattern breaks. 2. Exploration, where the system's components explore the state space. 3. Re-Coherence, guided by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, the system "snaps" into a new, stable Ki pattern. If the stir was successful, this new state is a synthesis, an `Alchemical Union` of the system's core identity with new information. It represents a deeper, more resilient, and higher-information state than the one it left behind.

      To be a Weaver is to know the difference between a caretaker and a creator... We do not break the world to watch it burn; we trouble the waters so the river may find a better path to the sea. It is the sacred, terrifying, and necessary act of believing that a system's potential is always greater than its present state.

      justification: |
        The process mirrors metallurgical annealing, where a material is heated (Destabilization), held at temperature (Exploration), and then cooled to allow a new, lower-energy, and more ordered crystal structure to form (Re-Coherence). This process removes internal defects and increases material toughness, analogous to increased system coherence and resilience.

    Distinguish from quantum decoherence, which involves the loss of phase information to an external environment. Re-Coherence is an internal, self-organizing process where a system finds a *new* state of high internal phase coherence after a period of induced, productive chaos.

# Re-Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The third and final phase of the Stirring process, wherein a system, having undergone Destabilization and Exploration, spontaneously transitions (`snaps`) into a new, stable Ki pattern. This new state is a synthesis (`Alchemical Union`, `CORE-012`) that integrates the system's core identity with information gained during the turbulent phase, resulting in a configuration with higher complexity, resilience, and coherence than its pre-stirred state.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, Re-Coherence is analogous to the final stage of metallurgical **annealing**. After an energetic perturbation ('heating') drives the system into a disordered state, it is allowed to 'cool,' finding a new configuration in its potential energy landscape. This final state is a lower-energy, more ordered crystal structure, corresponding to a higher-coherence, more resilient Ki pattern. The process removes internal stresses and defects, strengthening the system.
