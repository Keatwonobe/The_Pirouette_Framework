    The faint, logarithmic hiss of Higgs friction that slightly detunes the pure harmonic song of the generations, revealing their interaction with the scalar background.
  law: |
    The quadratic scaling of fermion mass with generation number (n) is modified by a small, positive correction term (ε_n) that grows logarithmically with n, proportional to the Higgs-Γ coupling constant.
  philosophy: |
    These corrections demonstrate that the pure temporal geometry of flavor is not isolated. They represent the necessary "dressing" of the system as it couples to other fields, transforming an abstract mathematical series into a physically realized spectrum.
pirouette_definition: |
  Coherence-damping corrections (ε_n) are small, positive, dimensionless terms that modify the idealized quadratic mass law for fermion generations. They arise from the back-reaction of the Higgs field on the temporal standing-wave modes (Γ) that define flavor, introducing a logarithmic dependence on the generation number (n), such that `m_n = m_1 n²(1+ε_n)`.

        outline: |
          Measure the masses of the three charged leptons (electron, muon, tau) with high precision. Calculate the ratio `R_n = m_n / (m_1 * n²)`. The deviation of this ratio from unity directly yields the correction: `ε_n = R_n - 1`.

          - A positive deviation from 1 for the n=2 (muon) and n=3 (tau) mass ratios.
          - The ratio of corrections `ε_3 / ε_2` should approximate `ln(3) / ln(2) ≈ 1.58`.
        pitfalls:
          - Requires disentangling these corrections from other Standard Model radiative corrections (e.g., QED self-energy).
          - Assumes the underlying quadratic mass law is exact prior to this effect.

        In the Standard Model, Yukawa couplings "run" with the energy scale. The logarithmic form of ε_n mirrors this dependence, where the generation number `n` acts as a proxy for the mass scale. This suggests ε_n is the Pirouette analogue of a one-loop radiative correction to the base "Yukawa" term derived from the `n²` law.

      rationale: The logarithmic dependence on the generational index `n` is characteristic of one-loop corrections in QFT. This maps ε_n to the quantum corrections that "dress" a bare coupling, providing a physical mechanism for the final small adjustments to the mass spectrum.

    The term "damping" refers to the physical origin: the Γ-field mode loses coherence (damps) through interaction with the Higgs condensate, analogous to mechanical friction. This is distinct from the cosmological damping term (`3H\dot{\Gamma}`) related to the expansion of the universe.

# Coherence-damping corrections

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Coherence-damping corrections (ε_n) are small, positive, dimensionless terms that modify the idealized quadratic mass law for fermion generations. They arise from the back-reaction of the Higgs field on the temporal standing-wave modes (Γ) that define flavor, introducing a logarithmic dependence on the generation number (n), such that `m_n = m_1 n²(1+ε_n)`.

## EFT-First Summary
In Standard Model terms, Coherence-damping corrections are the Pirouette analogue of one-loop radiative corrections to the effective Yukawa couplings. While the primary mass hierarchy comes from a base `n²` law, these small, logarithmic corrections `ε_n ~ ln(n)` arise from interaction with the Higgs field, mirroring the energy-scale dependence (running) of couplings in QFT. This provides a mechanism for the final, precise values of the fermion masses.
