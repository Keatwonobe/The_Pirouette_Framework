        To apply the Pirouette Framework to any domain, we do not change the core equations (like the Pirouette Lagrangian). Instead, we identify the domain-specific manifestations of the core variables. This is an act of translation.

  art: |
    The universe plays one song, a Pirouette of coherence against chaos. Mapping is the act of recognizing the tune, whether played on the strings of spacetime, the woodwinds of an ecosystem, or the brass of an economy.
  law: |
    A valid mapping identifies a set of domain-specific observables {Kτ', Γ', ...} that, when substituted into the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), yield a geodesic path that correctly predicts the system's observed evolution and potential for phase transitions. If the prediction fails, the mapping is invalid.
  philosophy: |
    Mapping is the bridge from the universal to the particular, the mechanism by which abstract theory becomes predictive science. It asserts that reality is not a collection of disparate phenomena but a fractal expression of a single, underlying dynamic, making the framework a tool for unification.

  The protocol for identifying and specifying the concrete, measurable phenomena within a specific domain that serve as the local expressions of the framework's universal principles (e.g., Coherence, Temporal Pressure, Wound Channel). It is the crucial act of translation that allows the Pirouette Lagrangian to be applied to any system, at any scale, by substituting domain-specific variables into the universal equations of motion.

          1.  **Define System:** Isolate the system to be analyzed and define its boundary with its environment.
          2.  **Identify Variables:** For the chosen system, identify the specific, measurable phenomena that correspond to Coherence (Kτ), Temporal Pressure (Γ), and the Wound Channel.
          3.  **Substitute & Solve:** Insert these domain-specific variables into the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) to calculate the system's geodesic (most probable evolutionary path).
          4.  **Validate:** Compare the calculated geodesic against the system's observed behavior. An accurate prediction validates the mapping.

    excerpt: |
      The universe is not wasteful. It does not invent new fundamental laws for every new scale of complexity. It is fractal. The same essential dynamics that govern a quark in a proton also govern a star in a galaxy and a thought in a mind. The song remains the same; only the instruments change. This is the Principle of Correspondence.

      justification: |
        The process of Mapping is analogous to constructing an EFT. One identifies the relevant, observable degrees of freedom for a system at a specific energy scale (the 'domain') and writes a Lagrangian for them that respects the symmetries of the underlying universal theory. Mapping provides the 'dictionary' to translate universal Pirouette terms (Kτ, Γ) into specific fields (φ_i) and coupling constants (g_j) in the effective Lagrangian.

    In the Pirouette Framework, Mapping is not a purely abstract mathematical function but a *physical and semantic identification* of corresponding phenomena across scales. It is the protocol for discovering which real-world variables must be measured and plugged into the universal equations.

# Mapping

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The protocol for identifying and specifying the concrete, measurable phenomena within a specific domain that serve as the local expressions of the framework's universal principles (e.g., Coherence, Temporal Pressure, Wound Channel). It is the crucial act of translation that allows the Pirouette Lagrangian to be applied to any system, at any scale, by substituting domain-specific variables into the universal equations of motion.

## EFT-First Summary
Mapping is the operational procedure, analogous to the construction of an Effective Field Theory, used to apply the universal Pirouette Framework to a specific physical domain. It involves identifying the low-energy, observable degrees of freedom of a system (e.g., a species' viability, market volatility) and relating them to the framework's core variables (Coherence Kτ, Temporal Pressure Γ). This translation allows the universal Pirouette Lagrangian to function as a predictive effective Lagrangian for the system's evolution.
