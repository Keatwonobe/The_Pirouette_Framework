    Growth that remembers its own path, spiraling upward from its past. It is the form of a lesson learned, a scar healed into strength, a seed unfolding its inherited code.
  law: |
    A system's rate of change is a function of its current state and its integrated past states (Wound Channel). A purely helical system exhibits a temporal signature with a single dominant frequency whose phase or amplitude drifts predictably over cycles (i.e., a chirp or exponential growth).
  philosophy: |
    The Helix establishes that growth is not erasure, but integration. It models how systems learn and evolve by recursively building upon their own history, transforming memory from a static record into the engine of future coherence.

          1. Capture a time-series signal of a key system dynamic (e.g., skill level, population size, economic output).
          2. Apply a time-frequency analysis (e.g., Short-Time Fourier Transform, wavelet transform) to the signal.
          3. Identify a dominant frequency component that exhibits a monotonic drift (chirp) in frequency or a steady growth in amplitude over cycles.
          4. The magnitude and rate of this drift quantify the helical component.

        A chirp signal's instantaneous frequency changes linearly over time. This directly models the "evolves with each cycle" aspect of the Helix, providing a concrete, measurable signal for its presence in a system's temporal signature.

      rationale: |
        While a chirp signal is a manifestation of a helical process, an autoregressive model more fundamentally captures the causal mechanism: "recursively interacting with its own history." The model `X_t = c + Σ(φ_i * X_{t-i}) + ε_t` directly formalizes a system's dependence on its past states, which is the core of the Helix resonance.

      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observation of a complex adaptive system that achieves a new, stable state without a transitional period of helical dynamics, or whose learning curve is a perfect step-function rather than a continuous curve, would challenge the necessity of the Helix as the primary pattern for evolution."

    In Pirouette, The Helix is not merely the geometric shape but the dynamic process of recursive growth it represents. It is distinct from The Orbit, which is a closed, non-evolving cycle, and from The Braid, which is a composite of multiple phase-locked helices.

# The Helix

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A prime resonance characterized by a spiral geometry, representing an open, evolving cycle. The Helix is the fundamental pattern of learning, evolution, and memory, where a system's state progresses by recursively interacting with its own history via its Wound Channel (CORE-011). It is the archetypal expression of Ki.

## EFT-First Summary
The Helix resonance describes systems whose dynamics are governed by their own history. Operationally, these systems are modeled by autoregressive processes where the current state is a linear function of previous states, `X_t = c + Σ(φ_i * X_{t-i}) + ε_t`. This formalism captures the essence of learning, memory, and evolutionary adaptation, where past events directly shape future trajectories.
