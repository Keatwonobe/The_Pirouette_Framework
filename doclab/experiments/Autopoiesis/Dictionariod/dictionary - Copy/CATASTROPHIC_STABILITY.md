        The Lock is a state of catastrophic stability—a form of immortality achieved by sacrificing all potential for growth, learning, or adaptation.

  art: |
    A memory becomes a monument, a flowing river of experience frozen into a timeless fossil. It is immortality bought at the price of all change, a story that can never be unwritten.
  law: |
    A system will transition to a non-evolving, perfectly persistent state when its internal coherence (`Kτ`) is maximized and external temporal pressure (`V_Γ`) is minimized. In this state, the system occupies a narrow, deep minimum of the Pirouette action (`S_p`), making any deviation energetically improbable.
  philosophy: |
    This concept provides the physical mechanism for persistence, memory, and dogma. It explains how dynamic processes become static structures, sacrificing future adaptability for the perfect preservation of the past. It is the process by which a fleeting verb becomes an immutable noun.
pirouette_definition: |
  A terminal state of perfect persistence achieved by sacrificing all potential for growth, learning, or adaptation. It results from Crystallization, a phase transition where a system's dynamic history (Wound Channel) solidifies into a static Information Lattice. This Lock state arises under conditions of extreme internal coherence (`Kτ` → max) and minimal external temporal pressure (`V_Γ` → 0).

        outline: |
          1. Monitor the system's state vector `Ψ(t)` over an extended period.
          2. Compute the power spectrum of `Ψ(t)`. A Lock is indicated if the spectrum collapses to a single frequency (and its harmonics) or a DC component, showing no broadband noise or evolution.
          3. Apply small, non-resonant energy perturbations. A locked system will show a purely elastic response with no absorption or state change.
          4. Concurrently, measure the environmental `V_Γ` to be near zero and internal coherence `Kτ` to be approaching 1.

  - module: DOMA-048
    excerpt: |
      This module describes the dynamics of catastrophic stability. It defines Crystallization, the phase transition where the fluid geometry of the Wound Channel solidifies into a rigid, static Information Lattice. It further defines the ultimate expression of this process: the Lock, a terminal state of perfect coherence where a memory becomes a monument, a habit becomes a law, and a dynamic echo becomes a timeless fossil.
  - module: DOMA-048
    excerpt: |
      The Lock is a state of catastrophic stability—a form of immortality achieved by sacrificing all potential for growth, learning, or adaptation. The stability of this state, its Lock Resilience, grows exponentially with its internal order. It can become "energetically cheaper" for the universe to route causality around this frozen point in spacetime than to try and melt it.

        Catastrophic Stability describes a system trapped in a state from which escape is energetically prohibitive. This is analogous to a particle in a deep potential energy well in classical mechanics, or a field that has settled into its true vacuum state in quantum field theory. A large activation energy is required to transition to any other state.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from simple stability or equilibrium. Catastrophic Stability is a *terminal* state where the potential for change has been sacrificed for persistence. It is not merely being at rest, but being fundamentally incapable of motion or adaptation. The term "catastrophic" refers to the loss of all future potential.

# Catastrophic Stability

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A terminal state of perfect persistence achieved by sacrificing all potential for growth, learning, or adaptation. It results from Crystallization, a phase transition where a system's dynamic history (Wound Channel) solidifies into a static Information Lattice. This Lock state arises under conditions of extreme internal coherence (`Kτ` → max) and minimal external temporal pressure (`V_Γ` → 0).
