  law: |
    Residual Stiffness Energy Density sources an effective cosmological constant Λ_eff via the relation Λ_eff = 8πG_eff * ρ_Γ,res, causing the accelerated expansion of the universe.
  philosophy: |
    This term unifies the origin of dark energy with the mechanism for particle mass generation (Γ-stiffness), framing both as manifestations of the time substrate's elasticity. It replaces an arbitrary cosmological constant with a physically derived, slowly evolving vacuum energy.

  The potential energy density arising from frozen-out, long-wavelength fluctuations of the Γ-field, δΓ, in the low-coherence limit. It is formally defined as ρ_Γ,res = (1/2)V''(Γ_0)⟨(δΓ)^2⟩, where V''(Γ_0) is the stiffness of the Γ-field potential around its vacuum expectation value Γ_0. This energy density is spatially uniform and acts as a source for the effective cosmological constant, Λ_eff.

# Residual Stiffness Energy Density

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The potential energy density arising from frozen-out, long-wavelength fluctuations of the Γ-field, δΓ, in the low-coherence limit. It is formally defined as ρ_Γ,res = (1/2)V''(Γ_0)⟨(δΓ)^2⟩, where V''(Γ_0) is the stiffness of the Γ-field potential around its vacuum expectation value Γ_0. This energy density is spatially uniform and acts as a source for the effective cosmological constant, Λ_eff.

## EFT-First Summary
Within the Pirouette Framework, Residual Stiffness Energy Density is the microphysical origin of the cosmological dark energy density, ρ_Λ. It represents the potential energy stored in vacuum fluctuations of the temporal Γ-field, which sources the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe. Unlike a pure cosmological constant, this term predicts a dark energy equation of state that slowly evolves with time and has a sub-luminal speed of sound, offering testable deviations from the standard ΛCDM model.
