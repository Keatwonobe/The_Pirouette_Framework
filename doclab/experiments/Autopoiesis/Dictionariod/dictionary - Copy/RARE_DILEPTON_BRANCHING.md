    A subtle off-beat in the Higgs’s song, heard in the collider's roar. The Pressuron resonance speaks by making the impossibly rare decay just rare enough to find.
  law: |
    The coupling between the Higgs field and the Pressuron (Γ) induces a new decay channel H→Γ*→l⁺l⁻ (where l=e,μ). This enhances the combined branching ratio for these decays by an order of magnitude over the Standard Model prediction for electrons, to BR_Γ ~ 10⁻⁷.
  philosophy: |
    This observable signature provides a direct experimental window into the coupling between mass-giving coherence (H) and temporal pressure (Γ). Its detection would confirm that the Higgs vacuum is not static but dynamically "breathes," linking electroweak physics to cosmic evolution.
pirouette_definition: |
  An enhanced branching ratio for Higgs boson decays into electron or muon pairs, predicted by the Pirouette Framework. The enhancement arises from a new loop-level decay process mediated by a virtual Pressuron (Γ), a direct consequence of the λ_HΓ coupling between the Higgs field and temporal pressure. This signature provides a key, falsifiable test of the Higgs-Pressuron interaction at collider experiments.

          At a particle collider (e.g., HL-LHC, FCC-ee), select events with exactly one high-energy electron-positron pair or muon-antimuon pair. Reconstruct the invariant mass of the pair. Count the number of events in a narrow window around the Higgs mass (m_H ≈ 125 GeV) after stringent background subtraction. Compare this yield to the Standard Model prediction to identify any excess.

        pitfalls: [Extremely large backgrounds from Drell-Yan (Z/γ*→ll) processes, requiring excellent lepton resolution and sophisticated background modeling. The signal is statistically limited due to the decay's rarity.]

        Integrating out the virtual Pressuron in the loop diagram generates an effective field theory operator that couples the Higgs bilinear directly to the lepton current. The Pirouette prediction for BR_Γ fixes the size of the Wilson coefficient C_Hl relative to the new physics scale Λ. This provides a direct bridge between the Pirouette model and standard BSM search frameworks.

    This term refers specifically to the enhancement predicted from the virtual Pressuron loop within the Pirouette Framework. It must be distinguished from the baseline Standard Model prediction for H→ll decays and from other potential Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios that might also modify this branching ratio through different mechanisms.

# Rare Dilepton Branching

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Rare Dilepton Branching is an enhanced rate for Higgs boson decays to electron or muon pairs, predicted as a key signature of the Pirouette Framework. This enhancement, raising the branching ratio to the ~10⁻⁷ level, is caused by a new quantum loop process mediated by a virtual Pressuron (Γ). It serves as a direct, falsifiable test of the fundamental coupling between the Higgs field (coherence density) and the Pressuron field (temporal pressure).

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), the virtual Pressuron contribution can be described by a dimension-6 operator that modifies the effective coupling between the Higgs boson and leptons. The Pirouette Framework predicts the size of this operator's coefficient, leading to an enhanced H→e⁺e⁻ branching ratio of ~10⁻⁷. A measurement consistent with the Standard Model, at sensitivities below this level, would falsify the simplest form of the Higgs-Pressuron interaction.
