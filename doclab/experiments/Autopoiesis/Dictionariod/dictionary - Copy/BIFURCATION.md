    The moment the universe chooses a key. A placid surface, chilled by temporal pressure, suddenly cracks and freezes into a new, intricate crystalline form. The bifurcation is the sound of that crack.
  law: |
    When temporal pressure, quantified by ⟨Γ²⟩, exceeds a threshold set by the bare frame-alignment stiffness α₀, the quadratic coefficient α(Γ) in the Higgs potential V(H) becomes negative. This renders the symmetric vacuum ⟨H⟩=0 unstable, forcing the system into a new ground state with ⟨H⟩≠0.
  philosophy: |
    The bifurcation is not an arbitrary parameter choice but the necessary consequence of a dynamical tension between frame stiffness and temporal pressure. It elevates spontaneous symmetry breaking from a convenient postulate to a calculated, physical event, making the electroweak scale a predictable outcome of deeper principles.
pirouette_definition: |
  The critical point in the dynamics of the Higgs potential, V(H) = α(Γ)|H|² + β|H|⁴, where the quadratic coefficient α(Γ) = α₀ − λ_HΓ⟨Γ²⟩ crosses from positive to negative. This transition is driven by the background temporal pressure ⟨Γ²⟩ overwhelming the intrinsic SU(2)L–U(1)Y frame-alignment stiffness α₀. The event marks a second-order (pitchfork) bifurcation that changes the potential's shape to the "Mexican hat," rendering the symmetric vacuum ⟨H⟩=0 unstable and initiating electroweak symmetry breaking by inducing a non-zero vacuum expectation value, v.

        The Pirouette Higgs potential has the exact mathematical form of a Landau free energy functional describing a second-order phase transition. The parameter α(Γ) plays the role of the temperature-dependent quadratic term `a(T-T_c)`, where the background temporal pressure ⟨Γ²⟩ acts as the control parameter analogous to temperature.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, "Bifurcation" refers specifically to the pitchfork bifurcation of the Higgs potential ground state, driven by the Γ field. It should not be confused with more general bifurcations in chaotic systems or other areas of physics, though it shares the same mathematical root concept of a qualitative change in system behavior as a parameter is varied.

# Bifurcation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The critical point in the dynamics of the Higgs potential, V(H) = α(Γ)|H|² + β|H|⁴, where the quadratic coefficient α(Γ) = α₀ − λ_HΓ⟨Γ²⟩ crosses from positive to negative. This transition is driven by the background temporal pressure ⟨Γ²⟩ overwhelming the intrinsic SU(2)L–U(1)Y frame-alignment stiffness α₀. The event marks a second-order (pitchfork) bifurcation that changes the potential's shape to the "Mexican hat," rendering the symmetric vacuum ⟨H⟩=0 unstable and initiating electroweak symmetry breaking by inducing a non-zero vacuum expectation value, v.

## EFT-First Summary
In effective field theory terms, the Bifurcation is the dynamical mechanism that generates the negative mass-squared term (`μ² < 0`) for the Standard Model Higgs field. Instead of being a fundamental parameter, `μ²` is identified with a field-dependent coefficient `α(Γ)` that becomes negative when the background "temporal pressure" field `Γ` is sufficiently large. This provides a physical origin for electroweak symmetry breaking, linking the electroweak scale to the dynamics of the `Γ` field. This mechanism is mathematically analogous to a second-order phase transition in Landau theory.
