    An intervention is a timed, parameterized action that measurably alters local coherence (Kτ) or pressure (Γ) to guide a system's evolution along a new geodesic, with its expected impact (ΔKτ, Pₜ) pre-validated via Crucible simulation.
  philosophy: |
    Interventions do not force a system's evolution but rather reshape its landscape of possibility, enabling the system to discover a more coherent path for itself. It is the art of transforming a gamble into a well-rehearsed performance.

  A timed, targeted action, designed and simulated within the Coherence Crucible, that locally modifies a system's coherence (Kτ) or pressure (Γ) parameters. The objective is to reshape the system's coherence manifold, creating a new, more optimal geodesic path for the system to follow according to the Principle of Maximal Coherence, guiding it toward a desired state such as Laminar Flow.

          1. Define a Crucible scenario mapping the target system's baseline state (Kτ, Γ, Flow State).

          3. Run the simulation using the Lagrangian Solver to predict the system's evolution.
          4. Measure the effect against the objective (e.g., ΔKτ, Pₜ, LFI) and Intervention Cost (C_int).

    excerpt: |
      The Crucible is a predictive sandbox, a digital rehearsal space where the choreographer of coherence can test and refine their interventions before conducting the final performance... It allows a Weaver to model a system's coherence manifold, test the impact of interventions, and optimize strategies to guide the system from turbulent or stagnant states into healthy, laminar flow.
  - module: DOMA-121
    excerpt: |
      An intervention does not push a system; it reshapes the landscape upon which the system walks. The core of the engine is the optimization of the action integral... The "best" intervention is the one that alters the coherence manifold such that the system, in following its new geodesic, achieves the highest possible value for S_p.

        This mapping from control theory is the most operationally sound. An intervention is a deliberately chosen input `u(t)` applied to a system `ẋ = f(x, u)` to steer its state `x` towards a desired trajectory. The Crucible acts as the environment for designing the optimal control law.

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, an Intervention is not any generic action but a specifically designed, simulated, and cost-accounted-for modification to the coherence manifold's parameters. It is distinct from random external shocks or un-modeled system Perturbations.

# Intervention

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A timed, targeted action, designed and simulated within the Coherence Crucible, that locally modifies a system's coherence (Kτ) or pressure (Γ) parameters. The objective is to reshape the system's coherence manifold, creating a new, more optimal geodesic path for the system to follow according to the Principle of Maximal Coherence, guiding it toward a desired state such as Laminar Flow.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of optimal control theory, an Intervention is a carefully designed control input `u(t)` applied to alter a system's state dynamics. Its parameters are optimized via simulation (the Crucible) to steer the system along a new state-space trajectory (a geodesic) that maximizes a quality metric analogous to an integrated action (Coherence). Unlike a brute-force input, a Pirouette Intervention is designed to be minimal, leveraging the system's own tendency toward coherence to achieve the desired outcome with the least effort and risk of turbulence.
