        We define **stickiness** \( \mathrm{Stk}(\mathcal{D}) \) as an operational score composed of four observables:

  art: |
    Most mathematics is an invented net cast into possibility. Stickiness measures which nets are woven from the same thread as the loom of reality itself, catching the world not by chance but by resonance.
  law: |
    A mathematical domain \( \mathcal{D} \) is physically load-bearing if and only if its Stickiness score, \( \mathrm{Stk}(\mathcal{D}) \), surpasses a calibrated threshold. The score is a weighted sum of the domain's ability to commute with spatialization (S), express physical symmetries (Y), compress derivations (C), and produce new falsifiable predictions (P).
  philosophy: |
    Mathematics is invented, not discovered. Stickiness is a diagnostic tool, not a theological claim, for identifying which invented formalisms happen to function as a stabilizer grammar for our physical substrate. It selects for utility and resonance, separating beautiful abstractions from the load-bearing structures reality can actually implement.
pirouette_definition: |
  Stickiness, \( \mathrm{Stk}(\mathcal{D}) \), is a composite, dimensionless score that quantifies the physical relevance of a mathematical domain \( \mathcal{D} \). It is the weighted average of four normalized, observable metrics:
  1.  **Œ£-Compatibility (S):** The degree to which the domain's structures commute with the spatialization map Œ£ from `DYNA-004`.
  2.  **Stabilizer Yield (Y):** The efficiency (low description length) with which the domain expresses the known conserved quantities and gauge symmetries of `SUBST-001`.
  3.  **Compression Power (C):** The reduction in the Kolmogorov complexity or Minimum Description Length (MDL) of core framework derivations (e.g., GR hydrolimit) when using the domain.
  4.  **Predictive Leverage (P):** The number of new, falsifiable predictions generated by grafting the domain onto existing models.

  The score is calculated as \( \mathrm{Stk}(\mathcal{D}) = \sum w_i M_i \) for metrics \( M \in \{S, Y, C, P\} \), with weights \( w_i \) defaulting to 0.25.

          3.  **Score Calculation:** Quantify S, Y, and P based on the card. Normalize all four metrics to [0,1] and compute the weighted sum \( \mathrm{Stk}(\mathcal{D}) \). Log the result to the `/analysis/math_adhesion/ledger.csv`.

        pitfalls:
          - "Vibes-based" estimation of components; each must be tied to a concrete calculation or proof.
          - Overstating predictive leverage with non-falsifiable or post-hoc "predictions".
          - Ignoring the increased complexity cost (constant ledger inflation) when calculating compression.

        Stickiness acts as a meta-level model selection criterion for mathematical formalisms, much like Bayesian evidence selects for models that are both accurate and simple (Occam's razor).

        Renormalizability is a criterion that selects a tiny subset of possible QFTs (the "sticky" ones) that are predictive across energy scales. It functions as a gate for physical relevance, discarding formalisms that break down or require an infinite number of parameters, analogous to the Œ£-Compatibility and Compression Power components of Stickiness.

# Stickiness

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Stickiness, \( \mathrm{Stk}(\mathcal{D}) \), is a composite, dimensionless score that quantifies the physical relevance of a mathematical domain \( \mathcal{D} \). It is the weighted average of four normalized, observable metrics:
1.  **Œ£-Compatibility (S):** The degree to which the domain's structures commute with the spatialization map Œ£ from `DYNA-004`.
2.  **Stabilizer Yield (Y):** The efficiency (low description length) with which the domain expresses the known conserved quantities and gauge symmetries of `SUBST-001`.
3.  **Compression Power (C):** The reduction in the Kolmogorov complexity or Minimum Description Length (MDL) of core framework derivations (e.g., GR hydrolimit) when using the domain.
4.  **Predictive Leverage (P):** The number of new, falsifiable predictions generated by grafting the domain onto existing models.

The score is calculated as \( \mathrm{Stk}(\mathcal{D}) = \sum w_i M_i \) for metrics \( M \in \{S, Y, C, P\} \), with weights \( w_i \) defaulting to 0.25.

## EFT-First Summary
Stickiness is a meta-principle for selecting which mathematical structures are suitable for building physically-relevant effective theories. It functions like a combination of model selection criteria from statistics and guiding principles from QFT. A high-Stickiness formalism is analogous to one that supports a renormalizable, predictive, and parsimonious EFT. Its components demand consistency with known symmetries (Stabilizer Yield), descriptive efficiency (Compression Power), and the ability to make new, testable predictions (Predictive Leverage), criteria used to vet candidate EFTs. For example, its conceptual parallel is the Bayesian Evidence, which penalizes overly complex models while rewarding predictive accuracy.
