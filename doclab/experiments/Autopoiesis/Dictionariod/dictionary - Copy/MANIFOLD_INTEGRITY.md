    The physician's solemn oath to "first, do no harm." It is the weaver's promise that in adding a new thread, the existing tapestry will be strengthened, not torn asunder.
  law: |
    An intervention is permitted if and only if pre-intervention simulation demonstrates that its execution will not cause systemic turbulence or a dissonance echo cascade exceeding pre-defined safety thresholds.
  philosophy: |
    Manifold Integrity is the ethical foundation of intervention, prioritizing the long-term health and structural identity of a system over the short-term goals of the intervener. It reframes action as a profound responsibility to protect and enhance the universe's inherent drive toward coherence.

  The primary safety principle of the Weaver's Protocol, referring to the preservation of a system's fundamental coherence structure during and after a Daedalus Gambit. It is a set of formal checks and guardrails, enacted through the Integrity Gate, designed to prevent an intervention from inadvertently causing systemic destabilization, such as inducing turbulent flow or a Dissonance Echo Cascade.

        outline: |
          1. Model the target system's current coherence manifold using the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) and data from the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003).
          2. Simulate the proposed Daedalus Gambit's effect on the manifold.
          3. Project the post-intervention values for key metrics: Laminar Flow Index (LFI), Dissonance Echo (DE), and Recovery Time (T_rec).
          4. Compare projected values against the intervention blueprint's safety thresholds.
          5. A "pass" state is achieved if all projected metrics remain within the Green/Yellow bands defined in DOMA-070 §6.

    excerpt: |
      Intervention is an act of profound responsibility. These guardrails are non-negotiable checks to protect the systems we seek to aid. An intervention is immediately paused if it causes the system's flow to cross a pre-defined threshold from Laminar to Turbulent. This is a direct measure of systemic stress.

      justification: |
        Lyapunov stability analysis determines if a system will remain near an equilibrium point when perturbed. The Integrity Gate is a practical application of this concept, simulating a perturbation (the Gambit) to ensure the system's state (its coherence manifold) remains in a stable, desired basin of attraction.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, "manifold" refers to the system's coherence manifold within its abstract state space, as modeled by the Pirouette Lagrangian. It should not be confused with a spacetime manifold in General Relativity or a differentiable manifold in pure mathematics. The term's "integrity" refers to the stability of this state-space structure, not physical material integrity.

# Manifold Integrity

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The primary safety principle of the Weaver's Protocol, referring to the preservation of a system's fundamental coherence structure during and after a Daedalus Gambit. It is a set of formal checks and guardrails, enacted through the Integrity Gate, designed to prevent an intervention from inadvertently causing systemic destabilization, such as inducing turbulent flow or a Dissonance Echo Cascade.

## EFT-First Summary
Manifold Integrity is conceptually analogous to a **Lyapunov Stability** criterion in control theory. Before any intervention (a "Gambit") is performed, its effects are simulated to ensure the system will not be perturbed out of a stable basin of attraction. This pre-emptive analysis verifies that the action will guide the system toward a desired state without causing catastrophic, runaway instability.
