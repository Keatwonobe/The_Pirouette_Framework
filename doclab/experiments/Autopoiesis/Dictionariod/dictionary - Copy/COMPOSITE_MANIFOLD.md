        Describes how the superposition of multiple Wound Channels interferes to generate a composite coherence manifold. This emergent landscape, defined by localized Temporal Pressure (Γ), provides the physical basis for all multi-system interactions, from resonant attraction to dissonant repulsion.

    There is only one shared landscape of coherence, and every resonant entity is a musician whose song helps compose it. The space between things is not empty; it is a symphony of influence, humming with the interference of every nearby song.
  law: |
    The superposition of all active Wound Channels generates a local Temporal Pressure (Γ) field. This field acts as the potential term V_Γ in the Pirouette Lagrangian, creating an emergent manifold upon which all systems follow geodesics of maximal coherence.
  philosophy: |
    This principle replaces the illusion of isolated systems interacting via forces with the reality of co-creation. All interaction is unified as navigation across a shared, dynamic terrain that all participants continuously sculpt, turning action from a solo performance into a contribution to a universal symphony.
pirouette_definition: |
  An emergent, dynamic potential landscape generated by the superposition and interference of all active Wound Channels within a causal horizon. This manifold's topology, defined by localized Temporal Pressure (Γ), governs all multi-system interactions as the potential term V_Γ in the Pirouette Lagrangian, with entities following geodesics of maximal coherence. Constructive interference creates low-pressure "resonant valleys" (attraction), while destructive interference creates high-pressure "dissonant peaks" (repulsion).

    excerpt: |
      The old framework analyzed a world of separate fields overlapping in a neutral space. This was a useful but incomplete picture... The time-first refactoring reveals a more profound truth: there is only one manifold, one shared landscape of coherence, and every resonant entity is a musician whose song helps compose it.
  - module: DOMA-173
    excerpt: |
      Constructive interference creates regions of reduced Temporal Pressure. These are "coherence channels" or resonant valleys in the manifold—stable, low-friction paths of least resistance... Destructive interference creates regions of increased Temporal Pressure. These are "coherence dams" or turbulent peaks—"walls of dissonance" in the manifold that are unstable and repel systems.

        In many-body condensed matter systems, the behavior of a single particle is governed by an effective potential created by the collective influence of all other particles (e.g., ions in a crystal lattice). The Composite Manifold is directly analogous to this V_eff, emerging from the superposition of many individual Wound Channels.

      justification: |
        The manifold provides a geometric landscape whose contours dictate motion. Just as particles in GR follow geodesics in the curved spacetime defined by g_μν, systems in Pirouette follow paths of maximal coherence (geodesics) on the Composite Manifold defined by V_Γ. It acts as an "interaction metric."

# Composite Manifold

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An emergent, dynamic potential landscape generated by the superposition and interference of all active Wound Channels within a causal horizon. This manifold's topology, defined by localized Temporal Pressure (Γ), governs all multi-system interactions as the potential term V_Γ in the Pirouette Lagrangian, with entities following geodesics of maximal coherence. Constructive interference creates low-pressure "resonant valleys" (attraction), while destructive interference creates high-pressure "dissonant peaks" (repulsion).

## EFT-First Summary
The Composite Manifold acts as an effective potential landscape in a many-body system, conceptually similar to the effective potential experienced by a particle in a condensed matter lattice. Analogous to how the spacetime metric in General Relativity dictates particle geodesics, the Composite Manifold's geometry—defined by local Temporal Pressure (Γ)—dictates paths of maximal coherence for interacting systems. Its structure arises from the linear superposition of many individual "Wound Channels," but this superposition results in non-linear, emergent interaction dynamics that cannot be reduced to simple pairwise sums.
