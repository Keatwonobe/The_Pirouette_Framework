        The Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006) states that a system evolves along a path that maximizes its Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. Coherence Erosion is the physical manifestation of a system failing to meet this principle.

  art: |
    The calculus of persistence; the dynamic measure of a system's will to cohere against the universe's pressure to forget.
  law: |
    A stable system's trajectory through the coherence manifold maximizes the time-integral of its Lagrangian (𝓛_p = Kτ - VΓ), a path defined by the Principle of Maximal Coherence.
  philosophy: |
    The Lagrangian reframes existence not as a static state, but as a dynamic, costly struggle. It quantifies the 'effort' of being, making persistence a measurable, optimizable objective rather than a passive property.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Lagrangian (𝓛_p) is a scalar quantity representing the net effective coherence of a system, defined as the difference between its internal Temporal Coherence (Kτ) and the erosive potential (VΓ) generated by ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). Per the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006), a system's natural evolution follows a trajectory that maximizes the time-integral of 𝓛_p, thus ensuring the most stable and persistent existence possible under given environmental conditions. A system decays when it can no longer afford the energetic cost to maximize this value.

        outline: |
          The Lagrangian is not measured directly but is inferred from its effects on system stability.
          1. Measure the system's Coherence Lifetime (`τ_fade`) by fitting its decay curve `K(t)` to the Unified Fade Equation.
          2. Independently measure the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) of the local environment.
          3. Use the Pirouette Coherence Lifetime equation to solve for the system's internal Temporal Coherence (`Kτ` or its proxy `T_a`).
          4. Calculate the erosive potential `VΓ` from the measured `Γ` (model-dependent).
          5. The Lagrangian is then computed as `𝓛_p = Kτ - VΓ`. A long `τ_fade` implies a high, positive, and stable `𝓛_p`.

    excerpt: |
      The Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006) states that a system evolves along a path that maximizes its Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. Coherence Erosion is the physical manifestation of a system failing to meet this principle. A healthy system carves a deep "potential well" for itself on the coherence manifold. The ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ, which gives rise to the potential V_Γ) acts as a constant, erosive force that flattens this landscape... Decay is the process of this well becoming so shallow that the system can no longer afford the energetic cost of its own existence.
  - module: DOMA-125
    excerpt: |
      Coherence Erosion is what happens when the erosive power of the storm (Γ) overcomes the resilience of the signal (Kτ). This diagnosis dictates the strategy for intervention. To increase persistence, a Weaver must either **strengthen the thread** (increase Kτ) or **shield it from the storm** (decrease local Γ), both of which are strategies to maximize the system's Lagrangian.

      justification: |
        The Pirouette Lagrangian is a direct conceptual and mathematical analog of the Lagrangian in classical mechanics. Internal Temporal Coherence (Kτ) serves as the kinetic term (T), representing the system's dynamic organization. The Coherence Potential (VΓ), derived from environmental pressure, serves as the potential term (V). The Principle of Maximal Coherence is thus an analog of the Principle of Stationary Action.

  disambiguation: |
    The Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p` is a scalar quantity for a whole system, analogous to the Lagrangian in point-particle mechanics. It is not a Lagrangian Density to be integrated over a spacetime volume. The subscript 'p' denotes 'Pirouette' and serves to disambiguate it.
