  art: |
    We sought the sense organs of a living universe. We found the design for a tuning fork and a microphone. The first measures the purity of a system's song; the second measures the encompassing noise.
  law: |
    Every verifiable measurement requires the explicit declaration of a Weaver's Lens, defining the domain-specific proxies for `KœÑ` (Coherence) and `VŒì` (Pressure) and adherence to the Calibration Ritual. A measurement without a registered calibration certificate is an opinion.
  philosophy: |
    The Lens grounds the abstract Lagrangian in empirical reality. It asserts that measurement is not passive observation but a disciplined, verifiable act of translation from a specific domain into the universal language of coherence and pressure.
pirouette_definition: |
  A universal, ratified protocol for translating domain-specific observations into the core Pirouette Lagrangian terms: `KœÑ` (Coherence) and `VŒì` (Pressure). The Lens is not a physical device, but a two-channel measurement methodology consisting of: 1) The declaration of domain-specific proxy variables for Coherence and Pressure, and 2) The execution of the Calibration Ritual to ensure verifiable, reproducible data provenance.
operational_definition:
  units: Produces `{KœÑ, VŒì}` tuples. Units (e.g., energy, action, bits) are context-dependent on the declared proxies.

        outline: |
          1.  **Define the Lens:** Explicitly declare the proxy variables for `KœÑ` and `VŒì` and record as a "calibration certificate."
          2.  **Vow of Silence (Zeroing):** Isolate the instrument to measure its internal noise floor.
          3.  **Harmonious Duet (Cross-Calibration):** Pair with a trusted standard to observe the same phenomenon and verify readings are within tolerance.
          4.  **Notary's Seal (Registry Commit):** Cryptographically sign and commit the calibration state and all subsequent `{KœÑ, VŒì, timestamp, calibration_id}` measurements to an immutable ledger.
        expected_signals: [A time-series of `{KœÑ, VŒì}` tuples.]
        pitfalls: [Choosing non-orthogonal proxies for `KœÑ` and `VŒì`, failing to isolate for zeroing (mistaking instrument noise for `VŒì`), calibration drift.]

    excerpt: |
      This module retires the bespoke hardware approach. It establishes a single, universal *method* for measurement, applicable to any system at any scale. The Weaver's Lens is not a physical device, but a disciplined protocol for engaging with a system and quantifying the two fundamental terms of its existence as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian: its internal, resonant stability (`KœÑ`) and the external, chaotic pressure it endures (`VŒì`).
  - module: DOMA-069
    excerpt: |
      This module is the essential bridge between the abstract mathematics of `CORE-006` and the tangible world. The entire purpose of the Weaver's Lens is to provide a continuous stream of empirical `(KœÑ, VŒì)` tuples. By feeding this time-series into the Euler-Lagrange equation, a Weaver can solve for the system's geodesic‚Äîits path of maximal coherence.

        The measurement of Coherence (`KœÑ`) via "phase noise analysis" is directly analogous to characterizing the frequency stability of an oscillator (e.g., an atomic clock). Low phase noise corresponds to high Coherence.

        The measurement of Pressure (`VŒì`) is explicitly defined as the integrated PSD of the environmental noise field. This is a standard technique for quantifying the total power of a stochastic process or noise source over a given bandwidth.

# Weaver's Lens

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A universal, ratified protocol for translating domain-specific observations into the core Pirouette Lagrangian terms: `KœÑ` (Coherence) and `VŒì` (Pressure). The Lens is not a physical device, but a two-channel measurement methodology consisting of: 1) The declaration of domain-specific proxy variables for Coherence and Pressure, and 2) The execution of the Calibration Ritual to ensure verifiable, reproducible data provenance.

## EFT-First Summary
The Weaver's Lens is an operational protocol for quantifying a system's dynamics by mapping observable phenomena to two effective terms. The Coherence term (`KœÑ`) is measured via techniques analogous to phase noise or Allan variance analysis used in precision metrology to determine signal purity. The Pressure term (`VŒì`) is measured by integrating the power spectral density of the environmental noise, a standard method in signal processing and statistical mechanics for quantifying external stress.
