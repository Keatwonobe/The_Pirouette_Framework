    The universe humming in tune with itself, a resonant chord struck when three lines of force braid into one. It is the geometry of pure, unimpeded flight, the stable spin of a system that has found its perfect stride.
  law: |
    In any system undergoing a tether-snap transition, the post-snap coherence constant converges to the Lorentz-invariant value K_{i,\text{motion}} = 4π/3. This value is falsifiable by measuring the energy cost of the transition against the predicted tether differential (ΔKi).
  philosophy: |
    Ki_motion represents the ideal state of dynamic coherence, where a system's internal topology has locked into a configuration that perfectly matches its motion. It is the target state of every "snap"—the resolution of tension into stable, self-reinforcing action.
pirouette_definition: |
  Ki_motion is the dimensionless value of the Ki constant, `4π/3 ≈ 4.18879`, which characterizes the rate of phase evolution in a system that has undergone a 'tether-snap' transition. This state corresponds to a Lorentz-invariant, co-moving frame where the system's underlying geometry is locked into a triad-helix or 2π manifold topology, representing a state of high-energy dynamic stability.

          Measure the activation energy `E_snap` for a large ensemble of quantized reaction events (e.g., molecular bond breaking). Simultaneously, measure the characteristic time interval `τ` for these events. Infer `K_{i,\text{motion}}` by inverting the relation `τ = h/(E_snap * K_i)` and isolating the post-snap value.

      The same hysteresis that governs cosmic topology governs molecular kinetics, making Ki the

        The spiral-extended Lagrangian term has the same topological form as the axion-photon coupling term in particle physics EFTs. `K_i` can be interpreted as a dimensionless coupling constant that, unlike a standard axion coupling, has two distinct stable values depending on the system's dynamic state.

# Ki_motion

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Ki_motion is the dimensionless value of the Ki constant, `4π/3 ≈ 4.18879`, which characterizes the rate of phase evolution in a system that has undergone a 'tether-snap' transition. This state corresponds to a Lorentz-invariant, co-moving frame where the system's underlying geometry is locked into a triad-helix or 2π manifold topology, representing a state of high-energy dynamic stability.

## EFT-First Summary
In an EFT context, `Ki_motion` can be mapped to the dimensionless coupling constant in a topological term analogous to an axion-photon interaction (`g_{aγγ} a F \tilde{F}`). Its fixed value of `4π/3` suggests a geometric origin, where the coupling strength is not a free parameter but is determined by the system locking into a specific Lorentz-invariant, helical topology.
