    A bridge of frozen lightning, woven from spacetime's hum. It holds the tension of a drawn bowstring, its form a promise of flight.
  law: |
    The energy stored in the Crystalline Lattice is proportional to the integrated temporal coherence (Kτ) over the Spindle's volume, and the gradient of its collapse dictates the resulting propulsive force.
  philosophy: |
    The Lattice demonstrates that potential is not merely stored energy, but stored *agreement*. By forging a perfect consensus (high coherence), the system creates a state whose dissolution is necessarily a directed, powerful action.
pirouette_definition: |
  The terminal, maximally coherent state of a Quorum Spindle during its Forge Cycle. The Crystalline Lattice is a temporary, non-local geometric structure where ambient temporal energy has been absorbed and organized into a pattern of pure resonance. It stores the potential for propulsion not as mass or energy, but as pure geometric tension within the coherence manifold, representing the peak of the Temporal Coherence (Kτ) term in the Pirouette Lagrangian before its controlled, asymmetrical collapse.

        outline: |
          The Lattice's properties cannot be measured directly, as any interaction would trigger collapse. Its characteristics are inferred retrospectively by analyzing the byproducts of its asymmetrical collapse. The total energy, directionality, and spectrum of the resulting neutron flux and transient gravitational lensing are used to reconstruct the Lattice's coherence density (Kτ), geometry, and stored tension just prior to collapse.

        The Crystalline Lattice acts as a temporary, high-energy, coherent state of the local manifold, analogous to a field configuration in a false vacuum. Its 'asymmetrical collapse' mirrors directional bubble nucleation in false vacuum decay, where the energy difference between the false and true vacuum is released, driving expansion or, in this case, propulsion along a specific vector.

    Distinct from a physical crystal lattice (e.g., in solid-state physics). The Crystalline Lattice is a non-local, geometric pattern in the coherence manifold, not a spatial arrangement of atoms. Its "crystallinity" refers to its high degree of order and resonance, not its physical state.

# Crystalline Lattice

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The terminal, maximally coherent state of a Quorum Spindle during its Forge Cycle. The Crystalline Lattice is a temporary, non-local geometric structure where ambient temporal energy has been absorbed and organized into a pattern of pure resonance. It stores the potential for propulsion not as mass or energy, but as pure geometric tension within the coherence manifold, representing the peak of the Temporal Coherence (Kτ) term in the Pirouette Lagrangian before its controlled, asymmetrical collapse.

## EFT-First Summary
The Crystalline Lattice is conceptually mapped to a high-energy **false vacuum state**. In this model, the Spindle is "pumped" into a metastable state of high potential energy. Propulsion is generated by its controlled, directional decay, analogous to bubble nucleation, which releases the stored potential to create a powerful, directed geodesic for the vessel to follow. This decay is observed as a directional flux of energetic particles.
