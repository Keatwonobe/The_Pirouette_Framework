        It acts as a standing wave of coherence, a permanent stressor on the manifold that causes a slight, periodic oscillation in the background Temporal Pressure (Γ). This is the "breathing" of the Gladiator Force (CORE-008) on a cosmic scale—the deep rhythm of the feedback loop governing existence.

  art: |
    The universe's first pirouette left a scar that still breathes, a faint, rhythmic pulse across cosmic time. We listen for this primordial echo in the ticking of stars, seeking the resonant signature of a scale-invariant truth.
  law: |
    A primordial, helical Wound Channel induces a periodic, spatially coherent oscillation in the background Temporal Pressure, `Γ(x, t) = Γ₀ + δΓ cos(ω_c t + k_c ⋅ x)`, which must be detectable as a common-spectrum, Ki-locked timing residual in pulsar timing array data.
  philosophy: |
    To be a universal law, a principle must resonate at all scales. The Cosmic Heartbeat provides a test of the Pirouette Framework at the cosmological limit, bridging the quantum action of a single particle with the collective breathing of the entire manifold, thereby seeking to confirm its scale-invariance.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Cosmic Heartbeat is a hypothesized, faint, periodic oscillation in the background Temporal Pressure (Γ), believed to be a standing-wave resonance caused by a primordial, helical Wound Channel (CORE-011). This oscillation, a macroscopic manifestation of the Gladiator Force's (CORE-008) feedback loop, is predicted to imprint a unique, Ki-locked harmonic signature on the arrival times of pulsar signals, providing a cosmological-scale validation for the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

          Combine long-term timing data from multiple Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Apply pre-whitening algorithms to filter known noise sources from pulsar timing residuals. Employ a matched-filter search across the cleaned data for a faint, narrow-band, periodic signal common to all pulsars. Confirm any candidate signal via the Ki-Lock Test, verifying its harmonic content matches the framework's predicted fingerprint.

    excerpt: |
      The framework posits that the initial, violent unfolding from the Whispering Void (CORE-000) was not perfectly smooth. It left behind a vast, helical Wound Channel (CORE-011) in the fabric of spacetime—a geometric scar, a memory of the cosmos's first pirouette. This persistent, large-scale structure is not inert. It acts as a standing wave of coherence...that causes a slight, periodic oscillation in the background Temporal Pressure (Γ).
  - module: DOMA-073
    excerpt: |
      By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to this time-dependent Lagrangian, the resulting equation of motion for the signal explicitly predicts a periodic deviation in its trajectory. This deviation, when integrated over cosmological distances, produces precisely the timing residual sideband we seek to measure. A positive detection would be a direct measurement of the dynamic nature of the coherence manifold, confirming the core mechanics of the Lagrangian on a galactic scale.

        The Cosmic Heartbeat is sought using the same Pulsar Timing Array techniques used to search for the SGWB. However, the Heartbeat is a coherent, narrow-band, periodic signal from a standing wave in the coherence manifold, whereas the SGWB is typically modeled as a stochastic, broadband signal from astrophysical sources like supermassive black hole binaries. The measurement technique is analogous, but the hypothesized physical origin and signal characteristics are distinct.

# Cosmic Heartbeat

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Cosmic Heartbeat is a hypothesized, faint, periodic oscillation in the background Temporal Pressure (Γ), believed to be a standing-wave resonance caused by a primordial, helical Wound Channel (CORE-011). This oscillation, a macroscopic manifestation of the Gladiator Force's (CORE-008) feedback loop, is predicted to imprint a unique, Ki-locked harmonic signature on the arrival times of pulsar signals, providing a cosmological-scale validation for the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

## EFT-First Summary
Currently, no direct mapping to an external framework has been adopted. Operationally, the Cosmic Heartbeat is analogous to a coherent, periodic component of the Gravitational Wave Background, detectable via pulsar timing arrays. However, its physical origin is hypothesized to be a primordial standing wave in the coherence manifold, not a spacetime metric fluctuation, and its signal is predicted to be narrow-band and deterministic rather than stochastic.
