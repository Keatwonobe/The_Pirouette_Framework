        Define Pirouette exponents as:
        * **(\alpha_P)** — coherence heat exponent (variance of (\Gamma))
        * **(\beta_P)** — order parameter growth
        * **(\gamma_P)** — susceptibility to external Ki perturbation
        * **(\delta_P)** — nonlinear response of (\psi) to field drive
        Derived from mean-field approximation:
        [\alpha_P = 0,\ \beta_P = 1/2,\ \gamma_P = 1,\ \delta_P = 3]

    At the edge of order, the universe reveals its favorite dance. From a thought collapsing to a crowd igniting, the rhythm of change is the same, a universal choreography of coherence breaking.
  law: |
    Any system exhibiting a second-order phase transition of coherence, governed by the Landau–Pirouette Functional, must display critical exponents converging to the mean-field values: α_P=0, β_P=1/2, γ_P=1, and δ_P=3.
  philosophy: |
    The class asserts that the fundamental logic of systemic change is substrate-independent. It implies that the mathematical laws governing the tipping point of a laser, a conscious state, or a social movement are identical, suggesting a deep, scale-free grammar for the emergence and collapse of order.
pirouette_definition: |
  A universality class describing the behavior of systems undergoing a second-order phase transition of coherence near a critical point. It is defined by the set of critical exponents (α_P=0, β_P=1/2, γ_P=1, δ_P=3) derived from a mean-field approximation of the Landau–Pirouette Functional. The class unifies the critical behavior of physical, cognitive, and social systems whose dynamics are governed by a coherence order parameter, positing that their scaling laws and emergent properties are identical, regardless of the underlying substrate.

          1. Identify a system exhibiting a coherence phase transition and define its control parameter (e.g., cognitive load Γ, curl magnitude Θ) and order parameter (ψ, e.g., TPCI ridge height).
          2. Systematically vary the control parameter to approach the critical threshold (T_c).
          3. Measure the order parameter ψ as a function of the reduced control parameter `t = |T_a - T_c| / T_c`.
          4. Fit the data to the power law `ψ(t) ∝ t^β_P` for `t → 0` to extract β_P.
          5. Repeat for other observables (e.g., susceptibility vs. `t` for γ_P, correlation length vs. `t` for ν_P).

        The Pirouette class uses the same mean-field exponents as Landau theory but generalizes their application from physical systems (e.g., ferromagnets, superconductors) to abstract coherence fields in cognitive and social domains. The Landau-Pirouette Functional is mathematically equivalent to the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional, leading to identical exponents under a mean-field approximation.

      rationale: The framework explicitly derives the class from the Landau-Pirouette Functional, F[ψ], which is a direct analog of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy. The exponents are identical, and the conceptual purpose—describing universal system behavior near a critical point via an order parameter—is the same.

  collisions: [The symbols for the critical exponents (α, β, γ, δ, ν, z) are inherited from the standard nomenclature in statistical mechanics. Care must be taken to distinguish them from other parameters using the same Greek letters in different Pirouette contexts.]
  disambiguation: |
    This class specifically refers to the mean-field approximation as applied to coherence phenomena. It should not be confused with other universality classes from statistical mechanics that include fluctuation effects (e.g., the 2D or 3D Ising model classes), which have different exponent values. The Pirouette class is applicable where long-range interactions or high effective dimensionality justify the mean-field approach.

# Pirouette Universality Class

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A universality class describing the behavior of systems undergoing a second-order phase transition of coherence near a critical point. It is defined by the set of critical exponents (α_P=0, β_P=1/2, γ_P=1, δ_P=3) derived from a mean-field approximation of the Landau–Pirouette Functional. The class unifies the critical behavior of physical, cognitive, and social systems whose dynamics are governed by a coherence order parameter, positing that their scaling laws and emergent properties are identical, regardless of the underlying substrate.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette Universality Class is the direct analog of the mean-field universality class for second-order phase transitions described by Landau theory. It posits that the collapse or emergence of coherence (the order parameter, ψ) near a critical point follows universal power laws, characterized by critical exponents (β=1/2, γ=1, etc.). This extends the theory from its origin in condensed matter (e.g., ferromagnetism) to describe transitions in cognitive and social systems governed by the Landau-Pirouette Functional.
