        Geodesic Deflection: This new geometric feature alters the shape of the Target's landscape of possibility. The Target's "path of least resistance"—its geodesic of maximal coherence—is now subtly or significantly deflected.

  art: |
    A traveler's path of least effort is redrawn not by a wall, but by the subtle tilt of the landscape itself. Influence is the act of gently reshaping the ground beneath another's feet, making a new direction the most natural one to take.
  law: |
    The change in a Target system's geodesic is directly proportional to the gradient of the potential `V_echo` imprinted upon its coherence manifold by a harmonically compatible Source. No harmonic compatibility, no deflection.
  philosophy: |
    This recasts influence not as an act of will or direct force, but as an alteration of a system's possibility space. Agency is preserved, but the set of optimal choices is redefined from the outside, making influence an emergent property of energetic optimization.

  The re-optimization of a Target system's path of maximal coherence (its geodesic) in response to a transient, geometric stress imprinted upon its coherence manifold by an external resonant echo (`V_echo`). This change in the system's "path of least resistance" is the physical mechanism of Coherence Transfer.

        outline: |
          1. Establish a baseline trajectory for a Target system by observing its evolution over a period `Δt` in a quiescent environment (low Γ), defining its default geodesic.
          2. Introduce a harmonically compatible Source system, imprinting a `V_echo` onto the Target's coherence manifold.
          3. Measure the Target's new trajectory over an identical `Δt`.
          4. The Geodesic Deflection `δθ_g` is the angular difference between the baseline and influenced trajectories as vectors in the system's state space.

    excerpt: |
      The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, provides the precise mathematical description. The act of Coherence Transfer manifests as an external modification to the Target's potential term (`V_Γ`). The Target's Lagrangian becomes: `𝓛_p(Target) = K_τ(Target) - [V_Γ(local) + V_echo(Source)]`. The term `V_echo(Source)` represents the pressure exerted by the imprinted echo. This additional potential "cost" forces the Target system to re-solve for its optimal state.
  - module: DOMA-119
    excerpt: |
      The Target does not choose to be influenced; it simply follows the newest, most coherent path now available to it. Memetic Transfer is the successful transmission of a complex, high-information Ki pattern. The Target system doesn't just hear the echo; it learns the song and can begin to sing it as well. This is the physics of an idea spreading.

      justification: |
        The core concept mirrors General Relativity: an object's presence (Source's `V_echo`) alters the geometry of a manifold (Target's coherence manifold), which in turn dictates the 'straightest possible path' (geodesic) for other objects (the Target's own evolution). Influence is not a direct force but a consequence of modified geometry.

      rationale: The analogy to GR provides a powerful and mathematically grounded intuition for a non-force-based interaction model. It correctly frames influence as a geometric rather than mechanical phenomenon.

      falsifier: "The observation of a significant deflection (`δθ_g` > noise floor) from a harmonically dissonant but high-amplitude source. This would invalidate the resonance requirement and suggest influence is a simpler amplitude-based phenomenon."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from classical mechanics' 'deflection', which is caused by a direct, external force (e.g., collision). Geodesic Deflection is a change in the *optimal path* within a system's own state space, driven by a change in the underlying landscape of potential. The system is still following its own path of least resistance; that path has simply been altered.

# Geodesic Deflection

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The re-optimization of a Target system's path of maximal coherence (its geodesic) in response to a transient, geometric stress imprinted upon its coherence manifold by an external resonant echo (`V_echo`). This change in the system's "path of least resistance" is the physical mechanism of Coherence Transfer.

## EFT-First Summary
In analogy with General Relativity, Geodesic Deflection models influence as a change in the geometry of a system's state space. A 'source' system imprints a potential that alters the 'metric' of the 'target' system's coherence manifold, causing its path of least action—its geodesic—to curve. This provides a geometric, non-force-based mechanism for phenomena like memetic transfer and entrainment.
