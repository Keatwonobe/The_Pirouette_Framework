        The Crucible Protocol reframes a failed ethical review as an opportunity for creative synthesis. It is not a gate of judgment, but a forge for refinement.

triad:
  art: |
    A forge where dangerous intentions are not broken but remade. It is a sacred arena for transforming the dissonance of a high-risk proposal into a harmonious, alchemical union.
  law: |
    Actions with a Coherence Risk (R_κ) > 0.75 are isolated and must undergo the Crucible Protocol. They cannot proceed until they are re-synthesized into a new form that achieves a ratified Laminar Path (R_κ ≤ 0.5).
  philosophy: |
    The protocol replaces punitive rejection with creative redemption. It ensures that ambitious, high-risk ideas are not discarded but are instead refined to serve systemic health, embodying the framework's core principle of cultivation over mere prohibition.
pirouette_definition: |
  A mandatory governance process for creatively re-synthesizing actions categorized under Coherence Quarantine (R_κ > 0.75) into a new, coherent form. The protocol is not a rejection but a structured refinement process consisting of three stages:
  1.  **Dissonance Audit:** An adversarial simulation to map the full geometry of the action's worst-case failure modes and Wound Channels.
  2.  **Synthesis Conclave:** A convening of the project's initiators and the audit team in a sacred arena, governed by the principles of *The Geometry of Debate* (DYNA-002).
  3.  **Alchemical Union:** The sole objective of the conclave is to collaboratively re-forge the action's design to achieve its original goals while ensuring it generates a Laminar Echo (R_κ ≤ 0.5).
  An action cannot exit the Crucible until this new, resonant form is achieved and ratified.

        outline: |
          1. Monitor the Coherence Risk (R_κ) calculation for a proposed action.
          2. If R_κ > 0.75, flag the action and confirm its isolation under Coherence Quarantine.
          3. Verify the initiation of a formal Dissonance Audit by a qualified, independent team.
          4. Monitor the Synthesis Conclave for adherence to the principles of *The Geometry of Debate* (DYNA-002).
          5. Evaluate the re-synthesized proposal's new R_κ calculation to confirm it meets the R_κ ≤ 0.5 exit condition.

      justification: |
        The Dissonance Audit is a direct analogue to "Red Teaming," where an independent group adversarially tests a system's failure modes. The subsequent Synthesis Conclave, which brings the "red team" and the original "blue team" together to fix the identified flaws, maps to the practice of adversarial collaboration to harden a system post-test.

      rationale: This term best captures both the adversarial audit and the subsequent mandatory, creative synthesis between the two parties, which is the protocol's defining feature.

  claims:
    - statement: "Applying the Crucible Protocol to high-R_κ actions results in re-synthesized proposals that have a statistically significant lower final R_κ and higher long-term coherence contribution (Δ𝓛_sys) than simply rejecting the actions outright or using a non-adversarial review process."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A longitudinal study shows that projects emerging from the Crucible have a similar or higher rate of creating Dissonant Wound Channels compared to projects modified through less formal review, or that the resource overhead of the protocol negates its benefits."

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette context, "Crucible" always refers to this specific governance protocol for re-synthesis, not a physical object or a simple trial. It is distinguished from standard "ethical review" by its mandatory, collaborative, and generative nature, which aims to improve and redeem an idea rather than simply approve or deny it.

# The Crucible Protocol

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A mandatory governance process for creatively re-synthesizing actions categorized under Coherence Quarantine (R_κ > 0.75) into a new, coherent form. The protocol is not a rejection but a structured refinement process consisting of three stages:
1.  **Dissonance Audit:** An adversarial simulation to map the full geometry of the action's worst-case failure modes and Wound Channels.
2.  **Synthesis Conclave:** A convening of the project's initiators and the audit team in a sacred arena, governed by the principles of *The Geometry of Debate* (DYNA-002).
3.  **Alchemical Union:** The sole objective of the conclave is to collaboratively re-forge the action's design to achieve its original goals while ensuring it generates a Laminar Echo (R_κ ≤ 0.5).
An action cannot exit the Crucible until this new, resonant form is achieved and ratified.

## EFT-First Summary
The Crucible Protocol is a governance process conceptually equivalent to institutionalized adversarial collaboration or "Red Teaming" from systems engineering. High-risk proposals (Coherence Risk `R_κ > 0.75`) are not rejected but are subjected to an intensive, simulated critique ("Dissonance Audit") to identify failure modes. The original team and the adversarial team then collaboratively redesign the proposal to eliminate these failure modes, analogous to a "blue team" and "red team" working together to harden a system after a penetration test.
