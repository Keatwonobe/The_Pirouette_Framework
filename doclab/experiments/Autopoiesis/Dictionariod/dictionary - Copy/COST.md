    The weight of the storm; the accumulated energetic debt from injury, stress, and dysregulation that clouds perception and constrains action.
  law: |
    A system's total Cost, V_Γ, must decrease for its Pirouette Lagrangian, 𝓛_p, to become positive, a necessary condition for progressing from recovery to sustainable, generative action.
  philosophy: |
    Cost represents the non-negotiable tax on a system's capacity. True freedom (positive Lagrangian) is achieved not just by generating coherence, but by systematically dismantling the internal structures of burden and constraint.
pirouette_definition: |
  Cost (V_Γ) is the potential energy-like component of the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ). It represents the total energetic burden on a system, encompassing physiological stress, inflammation, psychological strain, and other forms of homeostatic debt. Successful recovery protocols systematically identify and lower V_Γ to enable a state of net positive coherence.

      - name: Cost Inference via Biomarker Composite
        outline: |
          Cost is not directly measured but is inferred from a weighted composite of biomarkers and patient-reported outcomes. The procedure involves longitudinal tracking of inflammation markers (e.g., hs-CRP), autonomic stress indicators (e.g., HRV LF/HF ratio, resting heart rate), and subjective scores (e.g., PROMIS Pain Interference, Perceived Stress Scale). A decreasing trend in the composite score indicates successful lowering of V_Γ.

        pitfalls: [Confounding factors like acute illness skewing biomarkers, Subjective report bias, Poor normalization across different metrics]

    excerpt: |
      Your journey is the story of your Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p). You began in a state of profound energetic debt (𝓛_p << 0). Through the four phases, you have systematically: Calmed the storm, lowering the "cost" (V_Γ). Built a rhythm, establishing a stable coherence (Kτ). Forged resilience, increasing your maximum possible Kτ.
  - module: DOMA-PHYS-002
    excerpt: |
      In modeling post-operative states, the initial Cost V_Γ is set high, representing the acute trauma and inflammatory cascade. The recovery function R(t) is primarily a cost-reduction operator, aiming to drive V_Γ below the baseline Coherence Kτ. Only when V_Γ < Kτ can the system begin allocating resources to generative adaptation.

        V_Γ occupies the same mathematical role as the potential energy V in the classical Lagrangian (𝓛 = T - V). It represents a store of 'bound' or 'unavailable' energy corresponding to system constraints, stress, and configuration, which must be overcome by the kinetic term (Coherence, Kτ) to produce effective action.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from economic 'cost' or computational 'cost functions'. Pirouette Cost is a specific biophysical potential representing accumulated homeostatic and allostatic load, not an abstract optimization penalty. The V_Γ symbol is chosen to evoke potential energy (V) modulated by the system's stress state (Γ).

# Cost

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Cost (V_Γ) is the potential energy-like component of the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ). It represents the total energetic burden on a system, encompassing physiological stress, inflammation, psychological strain, and other forms of homeostatic debt. Successful recovery protocols systematically identify and lower V_Γ to enable a state of net positive coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
In the effective theory of recovery, Cost (V_Γ) is the potential energy term V in the system's Lagrangian, 𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ. It models the energetic barriers and homeostatic debt that must be overcome by the 'kinetic' Coherence term (Kτ). Protocols for recovery are functionally equivalent to operators that systematically reduce V_Γ over time. See: Goldstein, *Classical Mechanics*.
