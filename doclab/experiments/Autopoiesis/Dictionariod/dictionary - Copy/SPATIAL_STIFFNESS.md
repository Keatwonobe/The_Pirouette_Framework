  art: |
    The stiffness of the substrate against being wrinkled. It is the tension in the underlying fabric that dictates the energy cost of creating spatial patterns, governing how waves stretch and compress across the medium.
  law: |
    The Spatial Stiffness \(\Lambda_{Ki}\) is the positive coefficient of the spatial gradient term \(-|\nabla_\tau Ki|^2\) in the substrate Lagrangian. The ratio of Spatial to Temporal Stiffness, \(\Lambda_{Ki}/K_{Ki}\), defines the squared propagation speed of massless Ki excitations in the substrate.
  philosophy: |
    Spatial Stiffness breaks manifest Lorentz invariance at the fundamental level, proposing that resistance to field variation in substrate "space" (\(\mathbf u\)) is a distinct physical property from resistance to variation in substrate "time" (\(\tau\)). Emergent relativistic physics arises from the constant ratio of these stiffnesses, not from an axiomatic symmetry of spacetime.
pirouette_definition: |
  A positive scalar parameter in the substrate-frame Lagrangian, \(\mathcal L^{(\tau)}_{Ki}\), that multiplies the negative squared norm of the spatial gradient of the Ki field, \(|\nabla_\tau Ki|^2\). It quantifies the kinetic energy cost associated with static spatial variations of the field. Together with the Temporal Stiffness \(K_{Ki}\), \(\Lambda_{Ki}\) defines the emergent spatial metric \(\mathbf x = \sqrt{\Lambda_{Ki}}\,\mathbf u\) and the observer-frame speed of Ki excitations.

          3. Fit the collected \((\omega, \mathbf k)\) data to the on-shell substrate dispersion relation: \(K_{Ki}\omega^2 - \Lambda_{Ki}\mathbf k^2 - m_{Ki,\tau}^2 = 0\).
          4. The best-fit coefficient of the \(-\mathbf k^2\) term is the measured value of \(\Lambda_{Ki}\). This requires an independent determination of \(K_{Ki}\) or relies on measuring the propagation speed \(c_{Ki}^2 = \Lambda_{Ki}/K_{Ki}\) to break the degeneracy.

# Spatial Stiffness

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A positive scalar parameter in the substrate-frame Lagrangian, \(\mathcal L^{(\tau)}_{Ki}\), that multiplies the negative squared norm of the spatial gradient of the Ki field, \(|\nabla_\tau Ki|^2\). It quantifies the kinetic energy cost associated with static spatial variations of the field. Together with the Temporal Stiffness \(K_{Ki}\), \(\Lambda_{Ki}\) defines the emergent spatial metric \(\mathbf x = \sqrt{\Lambda_{Ki}}\,\mathbf u\) and the observer-frame speed of Ki excitations.

## EFT-First Summary
Within the Pirouette Framework, Spatial Stiffness (\(\Lambda_{Ki}\)) is analogous to the gradient energy coefficient in a Ginzburg-Landau effective field theory. It represents the energy cost of spatial variations in the field, similar to the stiffness or surface tension of an order parameter in a condensed matter system. The ratio of Spatial Stiffness to its temporal counterpart, Temporal Stiffness, determines the characteristic propagation speed of the field's excitations, \(c_{Ki}^2 = \Lambda_{Ki}/K_{Ki}\), analogous to the speed of sound in an effective theory of phonons.
