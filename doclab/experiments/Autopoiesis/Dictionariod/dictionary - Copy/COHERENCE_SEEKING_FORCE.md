  art: |
    A system does not fall into stillness; it climbs toward song. This force is the current of becoming that carries it up the mountains of resonance, seeking the peaks where it can express itself most clearly.
  law: |
    The effective force driving system evolution is directly proportional to the gradient of the Coherence Landscape; its vector points in the direction of steepest ascent toward maximal coherence: `F_p(S) ‚àù ‚àáùìõ_p(S)`.
  philosophy: |
    This force embodies the Framework's core teleological claim: that the universe is not driven by a descent into thermal equilibrium and rest, but by an ascent toward greater resonance, complexity, and expression.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence-Seeking Force is the effective force that directs a system's evolution within its state space. It is a vector field defined as the gradient of the scalar Coherence Landscape (`ùìõ_p`). This force compels the system to follow a trajectory of steepest ascent, moving from states of lower coherence to states of higher coherence, with stable attractors located at the landscape's local maxima.
operational_definition:
  units: `[ùìõ_p] / L`, where `[ùìõ_p]` are the units of the Pirouette Lagrangian and `L` is a characteristic length in the system's state space. The specific units are context-dependent.

          The force is not measured directly but is derived from the Coherence Landscape. 1) Define the system's state space `S`. 2) For a representative grid of points in `S`, calculate the Temporal Coherence `K_œÑ(S)` and Temporal Pressure `V_Œì(S)`. 3) Construct the scalar landscape `ùìõ_p(S) = K_œÑ(S) - V_Œì(S)`. 4) Compute the numerical gradient of this scalar field, `‚àáùìõ_p(S)`, to yield the force vector field.
        expected_signals: [A vector field where vectors point "uphill" toward local maxima (attractors) and away from local minima. The magnitude of the vector indicates the strength of the drive toward coherence.]

    excerpt: |
      **The Old Law (Energy Minimization):** A system seeks the lowest point in a potential energy landscape `V`. The force is one of descent: `F = -‚àáV`. Attractors are valleys.
      **The New Law (Coherence Maximization):** A system seeks the highest point in its Coherence Landscape, defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian `ùìõ_p`. The "force" is one of ascent toward greater expression: `F_p ‚àù ‚àáùìõ_p`. Attractors are peaks.

    excerpt: |
      Calculate the gradient field `‚àáùìõ_p(S)`. The vectors of this field point "uphill," showing the path of steepest ascent. This is the geodesic of maximal coherence, the most probable evolutionary path for the system from any given point.

        The force is derived from the gradient of a scalar potential, mirroring conservative forces in classical mechanics. However, it inverts the dynamic from energy minimization (`-‚àáV`) to coherence maximization (`+‚àáùìõ_p`), replacing the potential `V` with the Lagrangian `ùìõ_p` as the governing scalar field. It represents the "slope" of the objective function that governs system dynamics.

    The term "force" is used in the generalized, Lagrangian sense of a driver of change in a state space, not necessarily as a Newtonian `F=ma` interaction in physical space. It describes the *direction* and *urgency* of evolution, not the mechanism of mechanical interaction.

# Coherence-Seeking Force

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Coherence-Seeking Force is the effective force that directs a system's evolution within its state space. It is a vector field defined as the gradient of the scalar Coherence Landscape (`ùìõ_p`). This force compels the system to follow a trajectory of steepest ascent, moving from states of lower coherence to states of higher coherence, with stable attractors located at the landscape's local maxima.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence-Seeking Force is a novel concept within the Pirouette Framework with no direct one-to-one mapping in Effective Field Theory. It is conceptually analogous to generalized forces derived from a potential in Lagrangian mechanics (`F_i = ‚àÇL/‚àÇq_i`). However, its fundamental role is inverted: instead of driving systems toward minima of a potential energy, it drives them toward maxima of a coherence-based Lagrangian, representing a fundamental drive toward self-organization and resonance rather than equilibrium.
