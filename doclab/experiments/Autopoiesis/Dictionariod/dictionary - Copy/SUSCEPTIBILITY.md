  art: |
    A system’s attunement to the world’s clamor. Susceptibility is the resonant chord within a system that vibrates in sympathy with external frequencies, turning noise into either dance or disruption.
  law: |
    The loss of a system's Time-Adherence (1 - T_a) is proportional to the integral of the environmental noise power spectrum multiplied by the squared magnitude of its susceptibility, |χ(ω)|².
  philosophy: |
    Susceptibility reframes resilience. It is not about building impenetrable walls against the environment, but about possessing a resonant structure that selectively filters it. It measures which frequencies a system is open to, for better or worse.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Susceptibility, χ(ω), is the complex, frequency-dependent linear response function of a system's Ki rhythm. It acts as a transfer function in the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem, quantifying how environmental noise power at a given frequency ω is translated into a degradation of the system's Time-Adherence (T_a). Peaks in the magnitude |χ(ω)| correspond to the system's natural resonant frequencies, where it is most easily disrupted by external perturbations.

    excerpt: |
      The Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem states: Delta T_a is proportional to integral of [ S_eta(omega) * |chi(omega)|^2 ] d(omega). Where: S_eta(omega) is the power spectrum of the environmental noise eta(t)... and chi(omega) is the susceptibility of the system. It describes how sensitive the system's Ki rhythm is to being pushed at a given frequency. A system is most susceptible to noise that matches its own natural resonant frequencies.

    excerpt: |
      The Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem gives us a profound diagnostic tool... To maintain coherence is to be a good filter—to be able to absorb or deflect the environmental noise that exists at frequencies dissonant with one's own, while remaining responsive to the currents that matter. A system does not break because the force against it is too great, but because the noise is too loud.

# Susceptibility

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Susceptibility, χ(ω), is the complex, frequency-dependent linear response function of a system's Ki rhythm. It acts as a transfer function in the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem, quantifying how environmental noise power at a given frequency ω is translated into a degradation of the system's Time-Adherence (T_a). Peaks in the magnitude |χ(ω)| correspond to the system's natural resonant frequencies, where it is most easily disrupted by external perturbations.

## EFT-First Summary
In statistical mechanics, the generalized susceptibility χ(ω) is a linear response function linked to the thermal fluctuation spectrum by the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. Similarly, in Pirouette, χ(ω) quantifies how a system's rhythmic stability (Time-Adherence) is degraded by environmental noise, as formalized in the framework's Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem. It acts as a filter, where peaks indicate resonant frequencies that are highly sensitive to disruption. This provides a direct, measurable link between a system's internal structure and its resilience to external chaos.
