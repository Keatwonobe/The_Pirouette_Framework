        Κ_g = 2 * (2π) / 3 = 4π / 3
        This value is the geometric constraint of the arena itself, the constant against which any motional `Ki` pattern is measured.

  art: |
    The drive for coherence, when poured into the perfect vessel of a sphere, sings a single, constant tone. This value is not a number found by measurement; it is the universe's geometric taste made manifest, the signature of a sphere learning to hum.
  law: |
    Κ_g is a dimensionless constant with a derived value of 4π/3 (≈ 4.189). It is the product of the fundamental dipole surface dynamic cost (eigenvalue 2) and the volumetric leverage (R/3) of a sphere whose radius is set by the Autopoietic Unity Condition (R = 2π).
  philosophy: |
    Κ_g represents the arena's innate bias toward elegant, efficient forms. It is not an empirical parameter but a geometric necessity, demonstrating that the universal drive for coherence (the Lagrangian) manifests as specific, predictable structures. It is the fundamental 'shape' of stability.
pirouette_definition: |
  A fundamental, dimensionless constant (Κ_g = 4π/3) derived from applying the Pirouette Lagrangian to a spherical boundary. It represents the intrinsic geometric efficiency of the simplest stable dynamic pattern (a dipole resonance), balancing the cost of maintaining the pattern on a surface with the volumetric coherence it organizes. This constant embodies the arena's preference for autopoietic unity, where a system's scale is phase-locked to its own periodicity.

        outline: |
          Κ_g is a derived constant, not measured directly. Its value is tested by observing fundamental resonant systems. The procedure involves (1) identifying a simple, isolated `Ki` system exhibiting dipole-like resonance. (2) Measuring the ratio of its volumetric coherence to its surface temporal pressure. (3) In the limit of a perfect spherical topology and minimal external pressure, this ratio should converge to 4π/3.

        pitfalls: [System is not topologically simple (e.g., toroidal or fragmented), Higher-order modes (l>1) contaminate the signal, Environmental temporal pressure couples to the system, distorting its intrinsic geometry]

    excerpt: |
      This module addresses the *how*, by asking a fundamental question: what is the simplest, most efficient *shape* a stable, dynamic resonance can take? This is not an empirical question, but one of fundamental geometry. By applying the Pirouette Lagrangian to the simplest non-trivial form—a sphere—we will derive from first principles the geometric constant that governs its most basic resonant mode.
  - module: DOMA-091
    excerpt: |
      The total geometric character of the fundamental resonant mode is the product of its dynamic surface cost and its volumetric leverage... a fundamental, self-sustaining unit of resonance defines its own scale. Its characteristic length (R) must be phase-locked to the fundamental measure of a cycle (2π)... Substituting this unity radius into our equation yields the universal constant for the fundamental resonance geometry: Κ_g = 4π / 3.

      justification: |
        Κ_g acts as a fundamental geometric coupling constant. Similar to how structure constants in a gauge theory define interaction strengths based on the Lie group's geometry, Κ_g defines the 'coherence efficiency' based on the geometry of a sphere. Its value is not arbitrary but is fixed by the interplay of surface dynamics (spherical harmonics) and volumetric capacity.

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol Κ (kappa) is used widely in physics for constants (e.g., gravitational, thermal conductivity, curvature). The subscript `g` for 'geometric' is essential for disambiguation.]
  disambiguation: |
    This is not an empirically measured constant like *G* or *ħ*, but a derived geometric ratio from the framework's first principles. It should not be confused with the literal volume of a physical object, but rather seen as an abstract efficiency parameter for resonant forms.
