  art: |
    The singularity is replaced by a phase—a yolk of time under pressure. Outside, the loom of spacetime reads as perfect GR; inside, its threads hum, and the graviton registers their count as a barely-audible delay.
  law: |
    The medium's state is fully described by its phase, which determines the local metric. In its vacuum phase, it is indistinguishable from the GR vacuum. In high-curvature phases (e.g., inside a black hole), it sources finite, polarization-preserving corrections to gravitational wave propagation that scale with the squared ratio of the wave frequency to the medium's saturation scale, \((\omega/\omega_c)^2\).
  philosophy: |
    The temporal medium replaces the mathematical abstraction of the spacetime manifold with a physical substrate, thereby providing a mechanism to resolve GR's singularities through phase transitions. It preserves GR's successes in the low-curvature regime while offering a falsifiable, physically-grounded model for new physics at the Planck scale.
pirouette_definition: |
  The fundamental substrate from which the spacetime metric emerges (SUBST-001), characterized by fields such as the scalar Γ and kinetic term Ki. In the low-curvature IR limit, its ground state is the GR vacuum. Under extreme energy density, such as within a black hole's horizon, it undergoes phase transitions into non-vacuum states (e.g., Γ-Saturated "Planck Crystal" or Vortex-Foam), replacing the classical singularity with a finite physical structure that imprints measurable signatures on gravitational waves and photon rings.
operational_definition:
  units: The medium is a substrate; its state variables have units. Γ is typically modeled as dimensionless or having units of energy.
  symbol_table:
    - name: Γ
      meaning: Primary scalar field describing the medium's local state or order parameter.
      dimensions: Contextual (Energy or dimensionless)
      default_range: Varies by phase; near a constant \(\Gamma_\star\) in a stiff phase.
    - name: Ki(·)
      meaning: Kinetic operator for the medium's dynamics.
      dimensions: Contextual
      default_range: \(\langle Ki \rangle \to 0\) in a decoherent vortex-foam phase.
    - name: ω_c
      meaning: Saturation frequency or "barrier scale" where curvature growth stops and new medium phases appear.
      dimensions: T⁻¹

    procedures:
      - name: Gravitational Wave Ringdown Spectroscopy
        outline: |
          1. Observe a high-SNR gravitational wave signal from a black hole merger, focusing on the post-merger ringdown phase.
          2. Fit the signal to a GR-based quasi-normal mode (QNM) model.
          3. Search for residual frequency-dependent dephasing that fits the predicted dispersive law \(\Delta\phi_{\rm GW} \propto (\omega/\omega_c)^2\).
          4. Search for late-time, low-amplitude, regularly spaced echoes whose spacing corresponds to the light travel time inside the effective horizon.
        expected_signals: [Frequency-dependent phase shift across QNMs, a train of tiny, attenuated echoes with spacing \(\Delta t\)]
        pitfalls: [Low signal-to-noise ratio obscuring the effect, model degeneracies with near-horizon environmental effects, stochastic noise mimicking a decoherent core signal.]
      - name: High-Order Photon Ring Astrometry
        outline: |
          1. Image a black hole shadow using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at sufficient resolution to distinguish the n=1, n=2, etc., photon rings.
          2. Measure the angular diameters of the higher-order rings relative to the n=1 ring.
          3. Compare the measured diameter ratios to GR predictions. A deviation indicates a modified refractive structure near the light ring.
        expected_signals: [Sub-percent shifts in the radii of higher-order (n>1) photon rings.]
        pitfalls: [Insufficient angular resolution, astrophysical noise from the accretion disk, model degeneracies with black hole spin or exotic matter.]

  disambiguation: |
    The Temporal Medium is not an "aether". Unlike classical aether theories, it does not define a privileged rest frame in the low-energy limit. It is the substrate from which the metric and its symmetries (including local Lorentz invariance) emerge, consistent with the Substrate Charter (SUBST-001).

# Temporal Medium

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Temporal Medium is the fundamental substrate from which the spacetime metric emerges (SUBST-001), characterized by fields such as the scalar Γ. In the low-curvature IR limit, its ground state is the GR vacuum. Under extreme energy density, such as within a black hole, it undergoes phase transitions into non-vacuum states (e.g., Γ-Saturated "Planck Crystal" or Vortex-Foam), replacing the classical singularity with a finite physical structure that imprints measurable signatures on gravitational waves and photon rings.

## EFT-First Summary
The Temporal Medium is mathematically modeled as a minimally-coupled scalar field (Γ) with a canonical kinetic term and a self-interaction potential V(Γ). Its stress-energy tensor, \(T^{\mu\nu}_\Gamma\), sources the Einstein field equations, leading to modifications of GR inside a compact object. This construction is a well-established method for building "regular black hole" models, where the scalar field's pressure counteracts gravitational collapse to prevent a singularity. In the Pirouette Framework, this is interpreted as a phase transition of the underlying medium.
