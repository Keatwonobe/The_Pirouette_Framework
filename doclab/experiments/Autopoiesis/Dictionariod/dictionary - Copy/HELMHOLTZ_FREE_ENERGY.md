  art: |
    The net coherence a system possesses after paying the inevitable tax to chaos for the profound privilege of being. It is the operating profit on the ledger of existence.
  law: |
    A system at constant volume (V) and temperature (T) will spontaneously evolve towards a state that minimizes its Helmholtz Free Energy (F). This state represents the optimal balance between maximizing internal coherence (U) and minimizing the entropic cost (TS).
  philosophy: |
    Helmholtz Free Energy is the primary bridge between the microscopic dynamics of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`) and macroscopic thermodynamics. It reframes the second law not as a principle of decay, but as a system's accounting for its "coherence profit" under thermal pressure, making thermodynamics an emergent consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The net coherence available for work in a system at constant volume and temperature. It is the direct macroscopic expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`), calculated as the system's total Internal Energy (`U = K_œÑ`) minus the entropic cost (`TS = V_Œì`) of maintaining that coherence against the thermal environment. In the Coherence Ledger, it represents the system's "Operating Profit."

          1. For a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T, measure its pressure P as a function of volume V along an isotherm.
          2. Calculate the change in F between two volumes V‚ÇÅ and V‚ÇÇ by integrating: ŒîF = -‚à´(from V‚ÇÅ to V‚ÇÇ) P dV.
          3. Alternatively, if the system's statistical mechanical partition function Z(T,V) can be computed, F is derived directly via F = -k_B T ln(Z).

      justification: |
        The Pirouette definition `F = K_œÑ - V_Œì` maps directly to the classical `F = U - TS` by identifying Internal Energy `U` with total temporal coherence `K_œÑ` and the entropic cost `TS` with the environmental potential `V_Œì`. This grounds the abstract Pirouette Lagrangian in the measurable, well-established thermodynamic potential for systems at constant T and V.

  disambiguation: |
    Helmholtz Free Energy (F) is the available work at constant Temperature and Volume. This must be distinguished from Gibbs Free Energy (G), which measures available work at constant Temperature and Pressure. On the Coherence Ledger, F is the 'Operating Profit', while G is the 'Net Profit' after also paying for spatial displacement (PV work).

# Helmholtz Free Energy

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The net coherence available for work in a system at constant volume and temperature. It is the direct macroscopic expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`), calculated as the system's total Internal Energy (`U = K_œÑ`) minus the entropic cost (`TS = V_Œì`) of maintaining that coherence against the thermal environment. In the Coherence Ledger, it represents the system's "Operating Profit."

## EFT-First Summary
Helmholtz Free Energy (F) is the direct Pirouette analog to the standard thermodynamic potential of the same name, defined as `F = U - TS`. Within the Pirouette framework, it is reinterpreted as the direct macroscopic expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`), representing the net coherence (`F`) available after the system's gross internal coherence (`U=K_œÑ`) pays the environmental 'Entropy Tax' (`TS=V_Œì`). It governs the equilibrium state of systems at constant temperature and volume.
