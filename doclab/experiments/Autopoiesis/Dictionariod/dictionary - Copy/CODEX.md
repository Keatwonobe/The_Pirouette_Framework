        The Codex (PDF Output): This is the module's stable, archival body. Rendered using tools like Pandoc and LaTeX, it is an elegant, beautifully typeset document designed for human contemplation. The Codex is the deep and lasting mark left in the world of human thought, a testament to a specific moment of crystallized coherence.

triad:
  art: |
    The river of thought, frozen into a timeless crystal. A stable, elegant body crafted to hold a moment of resonant insight for human contemplation.
  law: |
    Every ratified `.pmd` module MUST be compiled into a stable, archival, and bit-for-bit reproducible PDF document.
  philosophy: |
    The Codex ensures that the primary artifact of the framework remains a human-readable, contemplative document, safeguarding narrative coherence and intellectual legacy against the ephemeral nature of digital signals.
pirouette_definition: |
  The stable, archival PDF output of a Pirouette module, generated by the Forge from a `.pmd` source file. The Codex is an immutable, elegantly typeset document designed primarily for human reading and long-term contemplation, representing the crystallized and finalized form of a module's narrative and blueprint at a specific version. It stands in contrast to the Signal, its machine-readable counterpart.

      - name: Codex Generation & Verification
        outline: |
          1. Compile a `.pmd` source file using the standard Forge toolchain (e.g., Pandoc/LaTeX).
          2. Verify the output is a valid PDF/A-compliant file.
          3. Compute a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the generated PDF.
          4. Re-compile the *same* `.pmd` source in a different environment and verify the hash is identical, confirming deterministic rendering.
        expected_signals: [Valid PDF/A file, Stable cryptographic hash]
        pitfalls: [Non-deterministic rendering from toolchain updates, Font embedding issues, Dynamic metadata (e.g., creation timestamps) breaking hash consistency]

    excerpt: |
      This Alchemical Codex is our commitment to creating artifacts that are wholeâ€”objects that speak the language of human poetry and machine logic with a single voice. To write in this form is to practice the very synthesis we preach, proving that rigor and freedom are not opposites, but the warp and weft of a single, coherent fabric.

      justification: |
        The Codex is an immutable snapshot of a module's state at a specific version, allowing for perfect restoration and archival. It is the canonical, human-readable representation of that saved state, functionally equivalent to a deterministic checkpoint in a complex computational system.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "The Codex generation process is deterministic; identical `.pmd` source files always produce bit-identical PDF outputs across different compilation environments."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "Two separate compilations of the same ratified `.pmd` module source produce PDFs with different cryptographic hashes."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The term 'Codex' for ancient manuscripts is an intentional evocation.]
  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, 'Codex' specifically refers to the final, compiled PDF artifact of a module. It should not be confused with the source `.pmd` file or its machine-readable JSON counterpart (the 'Signal').
