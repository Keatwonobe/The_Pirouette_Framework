        The system enters cascade mode when:
        [Θ > Θc = k_Γ ⟨|∇ϕ|²⟩ / ⟨|A|²⟩]
        This expresses that instability occurs when antagonistic circulation overpowers cooperative potential by a factor exceeding k_Γ.

    A single dissonant eddy captures the current, transforming a river of social discourse into an irreversible, turbulent waterfall that reshapes the landscape below.
  law: |
    A systemic cascade is initiated when the mean-squared curl of the social dissonance field (Θ) in a coherence-critical region exceeds a critical threshold (Θc), a value proportional to the ratio of cooperative potential energy to antagonistic circulation energy.
  philosophy: |
    The cascade marks the phase transition from a system capable of self-correction to one dominated by runaway feedback. Understanding its trigger distinguishes between recoverable stress and terminal decline, defining the last moment for effective, low-energy intervention.
pirouette_definition: |
  A systemic cascade is the nonlinear, irreversible propagation of coherence collapse through a social system, initiated when the curl component of the social dissonance field, quantified by the Curl Threshold (Θ), exceeds a critical value (Θc). This event represents a phase transition from reversible fluctuation to self-amplifying, turbulent decoherence, analogous to vortex shedding. The cascade is observationally preceded by critical slowing down indicators, such as rising low-frequency variance in Θ and cross-scale locking.

      justification: |
        The cascade is explicitly described as a transition from reversible ("laminar") to irreversible ("turbulent") dynamics, driven by the dominance of a rotational/curl component. This is analogous to how fluid flow becomes turbulent when inertial forces (driving vortices) overwhelm viscous forces (damping them) as the Reynolds number (Re) exceeds a critical value.

        The source module explicitly identifies the observable precursors—rising variance, cross-scale locking—as the "Pirouette analogue of critical slowing down," which are hallmark signatures of a system approaching a critical point in statistical mechanics.

    Distinguish from a 'crisis' or 'negative trend'. A Systemic Cascade is specifically the *irreversible phase transition* marked by a quantifiable criticality (Θ > Θc) and its associated precursors, not merely a period of high but potentially recoverable social stress.

# Systemic Cascade

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A systemic cascade is the nonlinear, irreversible propagation of coherence collapse through a social system, initiated when the curl component of the social dissonance field, quantified by the Curl Threshold (Θ), exceeds a critical value (Θc). This event represents a phase transition from reversible fluctuation to self-amplifying, turbulent decoherence, analogous to vortex shedding. The cascade is observationally preceded by critical slowing down indicators, such as rising low-frequency variance in Θ and cross-scale locking.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of statistical mechanics, a Systemic Cascade is a second-order phase transition within a social system. The Curl Threshold (Θ) acts as the control parameter, analogous to temperature, and the cascade is triggered when Θ exceeds a critical value (Θc). The event is preceded by universal indicators of criticality, such as the divergence of correlation length (observed as cross-scale locking) and response time (observed as critical slowing down), which are measurable in the social dissonance field.
