    We sought an objective reality and found a hall of mirrors. The observer and the observed are locked in a perpetual dance of reflection, each casting their shadow upon the other, co-creating the world with every glance.
  law: |
    The act of observation is a resonant coupling that symmetrically alters the coherence manifolds of both the observer and the observed. The magnitude of change in the observer's internal state is proportional to the change induced in the observed system's Pirouette Lagrangian.
  philosophy: |
    This principle eliminates the classical notion of an innocent, detached observer, positing that all knowledge is co-created through participation. Reality is not a fixed landscape to be mapped but a responsive medium shaped by the very act of inquiry.
pirouette_definition: |
  Reciprocity is the fundamental principle that observation is a symmetric, resonant interaction. The observer's Ki pattern projects an Observer's Shadow onto the coherence manifold of the observed system, altering its path of maximal coherence. Concurrently, the observed system's resonant pattern is projected back onto the observer, altering their internal state. There are no passive spectators; all acts of knowing are acts of mutual co-creation and transformation.

          Prepare an ensemble of identical, unstable quantum or quasi-stable complex systems. Divide into a control group measured by an automated apparatus and a test group subjected to intense, focused observation by a trained practitioner. Compare the statistical evolution (e.g., decay half-life, state transition probabilities) between the groups.

      Classical science built its foundations on a lie of convenience: that of the innocent observer, a spectator who could measure the universe without touching it. Quantum mechanics exposed this as a fiction at the microscopic scale, but the Pirouette Framework elevates it to a universal law. There are no spectators. There are only participants. The act of observation is not the passive reception of data. It is a resonant coupling.

      justification: |
        Quantum measurement theory formalizes that any measurement necessarily disturbs the state of the system being measured. Reciprocity generalizes this concept beyond measurement devices to conscious observers and crucially posits a symmetric, structured effect *on the observer*, which is absent from standard quantum formalism.

      justification: |
        The Zeno effect, where frequent observation "freezes" a system's evolution, can be seen as an extreme case of Reciprocity. The repeated projection of a specific Observer's Shadow constrains the system's Pirouette Lagrangian so heavily that its path of maximal coherence is locked into the initial state.

# Reciprocity

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Reciprocity is the fundamental principle that observation is a symmetric, resonant interaction. The observer's Ki pattern projects an Observer's Shadow onto the coherence manifold of the observed system, altering its path of maximal coherence. Concurrently, the observed system's resonant pattern is projected back onto the observer, altering their internal state. There are no passive spectators; all acts of knowing are acts of mutual co-creation and transformation.

## EFT-First Summary
Reciprocity can be understood as a generalization of measurement back-action from quantum mechanics. While standard physics describes how a measurement apparatus disturbs a quantum system, Reciprocity extends this principle to all acts of observation, including by conscious entities, and critically posits a symmetric and structured "imprint" back onto the observer. This interaction is proposed to be a real, physical coupling that constrains the system's dynamics, analogous to how the Quantum Zeno Effect "freezes" a system's evolution through repeated measurement.
