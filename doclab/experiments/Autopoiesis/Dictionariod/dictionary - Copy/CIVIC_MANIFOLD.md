        A society is not a machine to be engineered; it is a body to be healed. Its institutions are its organs, its culture is the nervous system that binds them, and its history carves a shared `Wound Channel` into the fabric of time. This collective body forms the **Civic Manifold**.

  art: |
    A society is a living body, its institutions the organs, its culture the nervous system. Its health is not a political opinion but a physiological fact, measurable in the clarity of its vital currents.
  law: |
    The long-term viability of a society is proportional to the coherence of its three Vital Currents (information, resources, trust) and inversely proportional to the misalignment between individual and collective incentives as defined by the manifold's geometry.
  philosophy: |
    By reframing governance from an act of control to an act of healing, the Civic Manifold model asserts that the purpose of institutions is to shape a societal landscape where the path of greatest individual success is also the path of greatest collective benefit.
pirouette_definition: |
  A model of an entire society and its institutional framework as a single, living system. The Civic Manifold's geometry is defined by its **Civic Resonators** (institutions), which shape the flow of three **Vital Currents**: information (nervous system), resources (circulatory system), and trust (connective tissue). Its overall health is diagnosed by assessing the state of these flows for pathologies like Sclerosis (stagnation), Fever (turbulence), or Atrophy (decay), with the ultimate goal of achieving a laminar state that generates a **Coherence Dividend**.

        outline: |
          1.  **Quantify Information Current (Φ_I):** Measure signal-to-noise ratio in public discourse, velocity and spread of verified vs. unverified information, and accessibility of critical knowledge.
          2.  **Quantify Resource Current (Φ_R):** Measure resource velocity, Gini coefficient for wealth/opportunity, supply chain latency, and energy return on investment (EROI).
          3.  **Quantify Trust Current (Φ_T):** Measure public trust in core institutions (media, science, governance) via longitudinal surveys and network analysis of cooperative vs. zero-sum interactions.
          4.  **Diagnose Pathology:** Map the vector [Φ_I, Φ_R, Φ_T] to a state. Low velocity in any current indicates Sclerosis. High variance and chaotic signals indicate Fever. A steady decline in all baseline measurements indicates Atrophy.

    excerpt: |
      The health of the civic body depends on the laminar flow of three primary **Vital Currents**: The Flow of Information (the society's nervous system), The Flow of Resources (the society's circulatory system), and The Flow of Trust (the society's connective tissue, the very medium of its coherence). These currents move through channels shaped by a society's **Civic Resonators**—its core institutions (laws, markets, media, schools) which define the geometry of the manifold.
  - module: DOMA-044
    excerpt: |
      A society's laws, norms, and institutions shape the coherence manifold for every citizen. A **healthy manifold** aligns pressures so that the path of maximal personal coherence for a citizen—to learn, create, and connect—also contributes to the coherence of the whole. A **dysfunctional manifold** creates a misalignment where a citizen must degrade the collective's coherence (through exploitation, corruption, or deception) to maximize their own.

        The Civic Manifold can be operationalized as a multi-commodity flow network. Institutions act as nodes and channels with specific capacities and latencies. Pathologies like Sclerosis map directly to bottlenecks and violations of the max-flow min-cut theorem, while Fever maps to inefficient, high-cost routing or network oscillations.

The "path of least action" for a citizen (governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian) is a geodesic on this manifold. A dysfunctional manifold has high, irregular curvature, forcing citizens onto extractive, inefficient paths.

  disambiguation: |
    The Pirouette 'Civic Manifold' is a conceptual model of a society's total state space, not a literal mathematical manifold. It uses the geometric intuition of a manifold to describe the *landscape* of incentives and flows, defining the "paths of least action" available to citizens within the system. Operationally, it is better modeled as a network than a continuous surface.

# Civic Manifold

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A model of an entire society and its institutional framework as a single, living system. The Civic Manifold's geometry is defined by its **Civic Resonators** (institutions), which shape the flow of three **Vital Currents**: information (nervous system), resources (circulatory system), and trust (connective tissue). Its overall health is diagnosed by assessing the state of these flows for pathologies like Sclerosis (stagnation), Fever (turbulence), or Atrophy (decay), with the ultimate goal of achieving a laminar state that generates a **Coherence Dividend**.

## EFT-First Summary
While primarily a conceptual tool, the Civic Manifold can be operationally modeled as a multi-commodity flow network where institutions form the nodes and channels. The three "Vital Currents"—information, resources, and trust—are the commodities. Pathologies like Sclerosis and Fever map directly to network phenomena like bottlenecks (see Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem) and chaotic oscillations, providing a quantitative basis for diagnosing societal dysfunction.
