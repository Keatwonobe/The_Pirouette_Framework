      snippet: |
        The gut-brain axis is a masterclass in this principle. A healthy microbiome is a symphony of Alchemical Unions (`CORE-012`) producing a spectrum of coherent signals. The keystone of these is Butyrate, a high-coherence, high-information signal (`CORE-013`) that is not merely a nutrient, but a current of pure instruction that harmonizes the entire system.

triad:
  art: |
    A river of instruction flowing from the garden of the gut to the entire system. It is the tuning fork that reminds a silent instrument of its proper pitch, restoring harmony from the inside out.
  law: |
    The magnitude of the Butyrate Current (J_β) is directly proportional to the coherence of the gut-brain axis. Its sustained absence is a sufficient condition for the onset of local Coherence Atrophy, manifesting as a collapse of the Gladiator Force and an increase in systemic Turbulent Flow.
  philosophy: |
    The Butyrate Current is the archetypal example of the 'Antidote of Coherence.' It reframes pathology not as a hostile presence to be attacked, but as a critical absence to be restored, shifting the therapeutic posture from warfare to cultivation.
pirouette_definition: |
  A high-coherence, high-information signal generated by Alchemical Unions (CORE-012) within the microbiome through the fermentation of dietary fiber. The Butyrate Current is the primary regulatory and energetic signal for the gut-brain axis, serving three core functions: 1) it provides the primary fuel for the Gladiator Force (CORE-008) of the gut lining, 2) it dampens systemic Turbulent Flow by reducing neuroinflammation, and 3) it reinforces healthy Wound Channels (CORE-011) via epigenetic modulation as an HDAC inhibitor. Its absence is the canonical example of a Pathology of Signal Absence, leading to Coherence Atrophy (DOMA-098).

    procedures:
      - name: Direct Fecal Metabolomics
        outline: |
          Quantify short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations, specifically butyrate, from a stool sample using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This provides a direct measure of the current's output at the source.
        expected_signals: [butyrate, propionate, acetate]
        pitfalls: [Sample degradation, transient dietary influence, reflects luminal environment but not necessarily systemic absorption.]
      - name: Indirect Microbiome Inference
        outline: |
          Perform 16S or shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome to quantify the relative abundance of known butyrate-producing taxa (e.g., *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii*, *Eubacterium rectale*). This measures the system's *potential* to generate the current.
        expected_signals: [Taxonomic relative abundance, gene presence for butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase pathway.]
        pitfalls: [Genetic potential does not guarantee metabolic output; abundance is not activity.]

    excerpt: |
      The keystone of these is Butyrate, a high-coherence, high-information signal that is not merely a nutrient, but a current of pure instruction that harmonizes the entire system. It Restores the Arena: Butyrate is the primary fuel for the cells of the gut lining. Its presence reinforces the biological expression of the Gladiator Force, sealing the barriers that prevent the chaos of the external world from becoming the turbulence of the internal.
  - module: DOMA-098
    excerpt: |
      The chronic absence of the Butyrate current is a profound silence that allows the entire system to descend into dissonance. To heal a pathology of absence, we do not require a poison. We require a note, a signal, a current. The therapeutic strategy is a Daedalus Gambit: a precise, minimal intervention designed not to attack the system, but to restore its own capacity for self-regulation and laminar flow.

      rationale: |
        The Pirouette term "Butyrate Current" is an operational and conceptual reframing of the biological molecule butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid. The term "Current" is chosen to emphasize its role as a dynamic, information-bearing signal that flows through and regulates the gut-brain axis, aligning with the framework's focus on information dynamics over static chemistry. Measurement of J_β maps directly to the measurement of butyrate concentration in relevant biological samples.

  claims:
    - statement: "Sustained restoration of the Butyrate Current (J_β > 15 mmol/L) in a system exhibiting Coherence Atrophy will measurably reduce markers of gut permeability (e.g., serum zonulin) and neuroinflammation (e.g., CSF TNF-α) within 90 days."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "A large-scale intervention (e.g., high-fiber diet, butyrate supplementation) that successfully and durably raises fecal butyrate levels fails to produce a statistically significant decrease in zonulin or key inflammatory markers across the cohort."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish between "butyrate" the molecule and "Butyrate Current" (J_β) the Pirouette concept. The latter refers not just to the chemical substance, but to its functional role as a continuous, high-coherence signal that sustains the Lagrangian state of the gut-brain axis. The term emphasizes its dynamic flow and informational content.
