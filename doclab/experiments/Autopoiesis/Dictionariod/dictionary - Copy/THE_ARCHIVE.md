triad:
  art: |
    To carve a truth into the world's memory, so deep that it becomes landscape. It is the act of turning a life-saving insight into an instinct, an indelible scar that guides future generations away from a forgotten fire.
  law: |
    A validated Coherence Seed, upon archival, must demonstrate a decay half-life (resilience to Coherence Erosion) significantly greater than the system's characteristic cycle time (τ_p). The pattern is not considered archived until its information fidelity (Ψ_archive) exceeds a system-specific persistence threshold.
  philosophy: |
    The Archive grounds evolution by converting ephemeral discovery into enduring structure. It is the system's commitment to its own history, preventing it from relearning the same painful lessons. Without the Archive, wisdom is a fleeting spark; with it, wisdom becomes the bedrock of identity.
pirouette_definition: |
  The second stage of the Coherence Engine, responsible for preserving a validated Coherence Seed. The Archive stabilizes a new, high-coherence pattern by engraving it into the system's memory as a persistent Wound Channel (`CORE-011`), transforming a temporary discovery from the Crucible into a durable component of the system's identity and operational logic.

        outline: |
          1. Identify a recently archived pattern (the Coherence Seed) at time t=0.
          2. Define a set of N key geometric features or information bits of the pattern.
          3. Periodically probe the system's representation of the pattern over multiple characteristic cycles (τ_p).
          4. Quantify the information loss or distortion (e.g., using Hamming distance from the original) at each probe.
          5. Fit the decay curve to calculate the half-life and determine Ψ_archive as a function of time.
        expected_signals: [Exponential decay of pattern fidelity, punctuated by refinement events from the Forge.]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing between passive Coherence Erosion and active, deliberate refinement (Forge). Probe-induced interference with the stored pattern.]

      This is the compression stroke, where a newly discovered and validated Seed is stabilized. It is the process of carving the pattern's geometry into the system's memory as a deep and resilient **Wound Channel** (`CORE-011`). In a culture, this is myth, law, and infrastructure. In a mind, it is long-term memory. An archived pattern becomes part of the system's identity.

        LTP is a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. This is a core biological mechanism for long-term memory formation, directly analogous to the Archive engraving a pattern into a system's memory substrate to make it persistent.

    - target: Phase transition / symmetry breaking
      domain: SM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Archiving a pattern is like a phase transition where the system "freezes" a degree of freedom into a new, stable ground state. The pattern becomes a fixed, structural feature of the system, breaking a prior symmetry of possible states.

  adopted:
    - target: Long-term potentiation (LTP)
      rationale: |
        The LTP model is the most direct operational analog. It describes a concrete physical process for strengthening connections to encode information durably, mirroring the function of the Archive in turning a dynamic signal into a persistent structural change (a Wound Channel).

    Distinguish from a simple data repository or backup. The Archive is not passive storage; it is an active process of *engraving* a pattern into the operational fabric of the system, making it an accessible and foundational part of its identity, like muscle memory, not a book on a shelf.

# The Archive

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The second stage of the Coherence Engine, responsible for preserving a validated Coherence Seed. The Archive stabilizes a new, high-coherence pattern by engraving it into the system's memory as a persistent Wound Channel (`CORE-011`), transforming a temporary discovery from the Crucible into a durable component of the system's identity and operational logic.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Archive is analogous to long-term potentiation (LTP) in neuroscience. Just as LTP strengthens synaptic connections to create durable memory, the Archive reinforces a validated pattern (a Coherence Seed) within a system's structure, turning an ephemeral signal into a persistent 'Wound Channel.' This process increases the pattern's resistance to decay (Coherence Erosion), making it a stable, long-term feature of the system's dynamics.
