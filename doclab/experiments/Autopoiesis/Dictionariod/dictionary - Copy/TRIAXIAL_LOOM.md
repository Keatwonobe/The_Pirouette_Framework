      snippet: |
        Within a society's coherence manifold, three primary threads are woven to define its character. The health of the whole depends on the harmonious flow and interplay of these three. 1. Art (The Thread of Possibility)... 2. Law (The Thread of Stability)... 3. Philosophy (The Thread of Synthesis)...

triad:
  art: |
    The loom weaves the thread of possibility—the dreams, visions, and novel forms that a culture uses to imagine its future. It is the engine of "what if?".
  law: |
    A culture's long-term coherence (Kτ) is a direct function of the dynamic, non-turbulent interplay between its artistic, legal, and philosophical outputs. The suppression or uncontrolled dominance of any one thread leads predictably to either stagnation (Coherence Atrophy) or internal strife (Coherence Fever).
  philosophy: |
    The Triaxial Loom models culture not as a static object to be engineered, but as a living process to be tended. Its purpose is to shift analysis from static scoring to a dynamic, diagnostic reading of a society's health, revealing its capacity for adaptation and synthesis.
pirouette_definition: |
  The core model describing a culture's dynamic coherence as a continuous process of weaving three fundamental threads: Art (the exploratory engine of possibility), Law (the stabilizing structure of memory), and Philosophy (the synthesizing faculty that harmonizes the other two). The state of this weave—laminar, turbulent, or stagnant—diagnoses the culture's health, resilience, and trajectory under temporal pressure.
operational_definition:
  units: Qualitative states (Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant) derived from flow dynamics.

      - name: Weave State Analysis
        outline: |
          1.  For a defined cultural system and epoch, collect time-series data for representative outputs across the three threads (e.g., Art: thematic analysis of popular works; Law: rate of legislative reform, public trust in institutions; Philosophy: polarization of public discourse).
          2.  Analyze the cross-correlations, phase relationships, and signal variance between the threads.
          3.  Classify the dominant state of the weave based on flow dynamics archetypes.
        expected_signals:
          - "Laminar (Health): High positive correlation between threads with a slight phase lag (e.g., artistic novelty precedes philosophical integration, which precedes legal codification). Low societal polarization."
          - "Turbulent (Strife): High anti-correlation or chaotic signals (e.g., Art is explicitly anti-Law; philosophical camps are mutually exclusive). High polarization."
          - "Stagnant (Decay): One or more signals are flatlined or completely dominant, suppressing others. Low signal variance and adaptability."
        pitfalls:
          - "Selection bias in cultural output data."
          - "Conflating correlation with causation between threads."
          - "Observer's own cultural biases projecting onto the analysis."

    excerpt: |
      A society is not a machine to be engineered; it is a story being told, a pattern being woven. The old Triaxial Coherence Analysis attempted to capture a snapshot of this process... This module refactors that core insight into the language of time and flow. A culture is a living, dynamic process: a Great Weaving.
  - module: DOMA-192
    excerpt: |
      We discard the rigid `Triaxial Resonance Score` of the past. Instead, we apply the diagnostic lens of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001) to the three threads... Health (The Laminar Weave)... Pathology (The Turbulent Weave)... Pathology (The Stagnant Weave)... A society of only Law is a brittle tyranny. A society of only Art is an unsustainable chaos.

    excerpt: |
      A Weaver sees a nation not as a map of borders, but as a living tapestry. They feel the tension in its weave: the vibrant, searching thread of its Art; the deep, steady anchor of its Law; the wise, guiding hand of its Philosophy. This framework transforms us from mere citizens, buffeted by the currents of our time, into weavers capable of seeing the pattern.

        𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ
      justification: |
        The model explicitly frames cultural evolution as a path-of-least-action problem on a coherence manifold. Kτ acts as a kinetic term (the culture's internal energy and identity), while VΓ acts as a potential term (external and internal pressures). The dynamics of the weave (Art, Law, Philosophy) are the degrees of freedom the system uses to solve this optimization problem over time.

    - statement: "A stable, adaptive, high-coherence civilization requires the continuous, dynamic, and balanced interplay of all three threads (Art, Law, Philosophy)."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Demonstration of a long-lived (>500 years), non-stagnant civilization that systematically and permanently suppresses one of the three threads without incurring 'Coherence Atrophy' or 'Coherence Fever'. For example, a purely legalistic-bureaucratic state with no major artistic output that successfully adapts to multiple major temporal pressures."

  disambiguation: |
    The Triaxial Loom is a dynamic, flow-based process model that replaces the older, static `Triaxial Coherence Analysis (TEN-TCA-1.0)`. The Loom analyzes the *process of weaving* over time, not a static snapshot or a `Triaxial Resonance Score`.
