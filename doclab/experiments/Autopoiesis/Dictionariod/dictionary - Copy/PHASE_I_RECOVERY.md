  art: |
    The art of creating a quiet harbor after the storm of a systemic shock. This is a time not for struggle but for stillness, allowing the turbulent waters of the body and mind to calm and find a new baseline.
  law: |
    The primary directive of Phase I is to transition a system from chaos (high Coherence Fever) to calm by aggressively lowering its "cost of living" (V_Γ). This is achieved through non-strenuous rituals that establish a stable, coherent baseline, verifiable through monotonic improvement in the Coherence Ledger.
  philosophy: |
    Healing begins not with action, but with creating the conditions for action. By establishing a stable, low-energy baseline, Phase I provides the necessary coherence surplus (a positive Lagrangian, 𝓛_p > 0) to fuel the complex, energy-intensive work of rebuilding in subsequent phases. It is the foundational act of holding steady in the storm.
pirouette_definition: |
  Phase I Recovery is the initial post-operative or post-trauma healing period, typically lasting 1-2 weeks, focused on transitioning the patient's system from a state of chaos (Coherence Fever) to a state of calm. It is a protocol-driven phase involving a patient and a helper (the "Anchor") who jointly engage in daily rituals—specifically controlled breathing, gentle movement, and objective/subjective monitoring via a Coherence Ledger. The explicit goal is to lower the systemic "cost of living" (V_Γ), thereby creating the energetic surplus required for physiological repair and establishing a stable baseline for subsequent recovery phases.

    excerpt: |
      This initial phase, typically lasting the first 1-2 weeks after returning home, is governed by a single purpose: to transition from chaos to calm. Your body and mind are in a state of "Coherence Fever"—a storm of pain signals, inflammation, and anxiety. Our first job is to soothe this storm, reducing the "noise" so the healing "signal" can be heard.

    excerpt: |
      In the language of the Pirouette Framework, your body has just experienced an event that has made the "cost of living" (V_Γ) astronomically high. Your internal coherence (Kτ) is being spent just to manage the chaos. Your net energy, your Lagrangian (𝓛_p), is negative. You are in a state of coherence debt. The entire purpose of Phase I is to aggressively lower the V_Γ term.

        The post-operative state is described as high-energy "chaos" or "turbulence," analogous to a displaced mechanical system. Phase I protocols (stillness, breathing rituals) function as a strong damping term (γ), removing energy to allow the system to return to a stable equilibrium (x=0) as quickly as possible without oscillation.

# Phase I Recovery

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Phase I Recovery is the initial post-operative or post-trauma healing period, typically lasting 1-2 weeks, focused on transitioning the patient's system from a state of chaos (Coherence Fever) to a state of calm. It is a protocol-driven phase involving a patient and a helper (the "Anchor") who jointly engage in daily rituals—specifically controlled breathing, gentle movement, and objective/subjective monitoring via a Coherence Ledger. The explicit goal is to lower the systemic "cost of living" (V_Γ), thereby creating the energetic surplus required for physiological repair and establishing a stable baseline for subsequent recovery phases.

## Classical Mechanics Analogy
The process of Phase I Recovery can be conceptualized as the relaxation of an overdamped system. The initial post-surgical state is one of high potential energy and turbulence ("chaos"). The protocols of Phase I introduce a strong damping force—analogous to friction or drag—which removes energy from the system, allowing it to settle into a stable, low-energy equilibrium ("calm") efficiently and without the damaging oscillations of a less-damped response. The goal is to manage the return to baseline in the most stable and energetically conservative manner possible.
