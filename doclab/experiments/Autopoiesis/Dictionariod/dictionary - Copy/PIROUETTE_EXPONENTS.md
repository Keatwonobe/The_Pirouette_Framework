        Define Pirouette exponents as:
        * α_P — coherence heat exponent (variance of Γ)
        * β_P — order parameter growth
        * γ_P — susceptibility to external Ki perturbation
        * δ_P — nonlinear response of ψ to field drive
        Derived from mean-field approximation: α_P = 0, β_P = 1/2, γ_P = 1, δ_P = 3

  art: |
    At the edge of a phase, the system holds its breath. These exponents are the grammar of its gasp—the sudden crystallization of thought, the flash-point of a mob, the silent locking of a thousand spinning magnets. They describe the shape of the avalanche just before it falls.
  law: |
    Near a second-order coherence transition, observables such as the order parameter (ψ), susceptibility (χ_P), and coherence length (ξ_P) exhibit power-law scaling with respect to the control parameter's distance from the critical point. These scaling laws are governed by the universal, mean-field exponents (β_P=1/2, γ_P=1, ν_P=1/2).
  philosophy: |
    The existence of a single set of exponents governing phase transitions in physical, cognitive, and social domains is the Pirouette framework's strongest claim to universality. It implies that the underlying dynamics of complex system stability are substrate-independent, governed by abstract principles of resonance and information flow captured by the Landau-Pirouette Functional.
pirouette_definition: |
  A set of four universal, dimensionless critical exponents {α_P, β_P, γ_P, δ_P} that characterize the behavior of a system's coherence (ψ) and related quantities near a second-order phase transition. Derived from a mean-field treatment of the Landau-Pirouette Functional, their values are {0, 1/2, 1, 3}. They define the Pirouette universality class, which applies to physical, cognitive, and social systems whose dynamics are governed by resonance conservation.

        outline: |
          1. Identify the system (e.g., neural ensemble, social group) and its control parameter (e.g., cognitive load Γ, social curl Θ).
          2. Systematically vary the control parameter towards its pre-identified critical value (T_c).
          3. At each step, measure the corresponding order parameter (e.g., TPCI ridge height, collective alignment).
          4. Plot the order parameter versus the reduced control parameter |(T_a - T_c)/T_c| on a log-log scale.
          5. The slope of the resulting straight line near the critical point provides a measurement of the exponent (e.g., β_P). Repeat for susceptibility to measure γ_P.

      Derived from mean-field approximation: α_P = 0, β_P = 1/2, γ_P = 1, δ_P = 3. These define the Pirouette universality class, mirroring Landau exponents but extended to multi-scale coherence systems where substrate couplings preserve resonance invariants.

    excerpt: |
      Thus, both consciousness collapse and social cascades are mathematically analogous to second-order phase transitions governed by F[ψ]. In cognitive science, this manifests as β_P ≈ 0.5 for the collapse of the TPCI ridge under high cognitive load (Γ). In sociology, γ_P ≈ 1 describes the diverging susceptibility to collective action near the critical curl threshold (Θ_c).

      justification: |
        The Pirouette exponents are mathematically identical to the critical exponents derived from Landau's mean-field theory of second-order phase transitions. The Pirouette framework re-interprets the Landau functional's order parameter as generalized 'coherence' and the control parameter as a domain-specific variable like 'time adherence' or 'cognitive load', thereby extending the universality class beyond traditional physical systems.

    These are mean-field exponents, representing an idealized system with infinite-range interactions or in dimensions d ≥ 4. Real-world systems, especially in low dimensions, will exhibit deviations due to critical fluctuations. The Pirouette framework posits that for many cognitive and social systems, the effective dimensionality or network topology recovers the mean-field behavior. Renormalization group methods (see MATH-026) are required to calculate deviations from these values.
