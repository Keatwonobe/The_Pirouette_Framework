        First, we measure the system's own, internal harmony. The analyst applies a suite of mathematical transformations to the dataset (e.g., Fourier, Wavelet, Topological Data Analysis). Each transformation acts like a tuning fork, designed to resonate with a specific *kind* of rhythm. This stage generates a set of *candidate melodies*‚Äîpotential `Ki` patterns that show a flicker of order within the noise.

    To listen for a system's true song within a roar of static. It is the act of striking a thousand different tuning forks at once, waiting to see which one makes the system's hidden structure hum in response.
  law: |
    A system's dominant internal pattern (`Ki`) is that which exhibits maximal persistence and self-consistency across a suite of orthogonal analytical transforms. The measured stability, clarity, and intensity of this dominant pattern directly yields the system's Temporal Coherence (KœÑ).
  philosophy: |
    Before one can measure a system's struggle against the world, one must first identify its will‚Äîits intrinsic, self-organizing principle. The Resonant Search isolates what the system *is trying to be*, providing the essential baseline of its identity against which all external pressures are measured.
pirouette_definition: |
  The first stage of the Coherence Sieve protocol, designed to measure a system's internal Temporal Coherence (KœÑ). The process applies a suite of diverse mathematical transformations (e.g., Fourier, Wavelet, Topological Data Analysis) to an input data stream. This identifies and isolates the most stable, persistent, and self-consistent internal pattern (`Ki`), which represents the system's dominant dynamic mode. The qualities of this pattern are then quantified to calculate KœÑ, the "kinetic" term in the Pirouette Lagrangian.

          1. Ingest a time-series or multi-dimensional dataset representing system behavior.
          2. Apply a diverse, orthogonal suite of analytical transforms (e.g., Fast Fourier Transform, Continuous Wavelet Transform, Persistent Homology).
          3. Within the output of each transform, identify candidate patterns (`Ki`) based on metrics of prominence (e.g., spectral power, wavelet coefficient magnitude, persistence lifetime of topological features).
          4. Cross-correlate all identified `Ki` candidates across the different transforms to find the single pattern that is most consistently represented.
          5. Quantify the clarity, intensity, and stability of this dominant, cross-transform pattern to derive the final Temporal Coherence (KœÑ) value.
        expected_signals: [Stable periodicities, scale-invariant structures, persistent topological features (e.g., long-lived loops in point-cloud data)]
        pitfalls: [Overfitting to high-power transient noise, mistaking algorithmic artifacts for true patterns, insufficient diversity in the transform suite causing analytical "blind spots".]

    excerpt: |
      The old "Universal Resonance Lens" sought fractal patterns across multiple domains, treating them as the goal. The modern insight is deeper: these patterns are not the goal, but the *evidence*. They are the footprints left by a system successfully navigating its geodesic on the coherence manifold. The Coherence Sieve operates on this principle. It is not just a pattern-finder, but a *manifold-mapper*.

        The simplest implementation of a Resonant Search is a Fourier Transform to find the dominant frequency in a signal. The power concentrated in the primary spectral peak is a direct analogue to the system's Temporal Coherence.

        PCA identifies the orthogonal axes (principal components) that capture the maximum variance in a dataset. The first principal component is analogous to the dominant `Ki`, and the amount of variance it explains is a measure of KœÑ. This maps the concept of "dominant pattern" to "primary mode of variation."

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, 'Resonant' does not refer to a physical system's response to an external driving frequency. It describes the *mathematical* resonance between a chosen analytical transform and a system's own *endogenous*, self-generated patterns. It is a method of discovery, not a physical phenomenon.

# Resonant Search

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The first stage of the Coherence Sieve protocol, designed to measure a system's internal Temporal Coherence (KœÑ). The process applies a suite of diverse mathematical transformations (e.g., Fourier, Wavelet, Topological Data Analysis) to an input data stream. This identifies and isolates the most stable, persistent, and self-consistent internal pattern (`Ki`), which represents the system's dominant dynamic mode. The qualities of this pattern are then quantified to calculate KœÑ, the "kinetic" term in the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Resonant Search is a generalized form of spectral and modal analysis used to identify the dominant, self-organizing mode within a noisy dataset. Analogous to using a Fourier Transform to find the primary frequency component and its power in a signal, this process uses a wider suite of transforms to find the most persistent pattern, quantifying its strength as the system's "kinetic" term, KœÑ. This is the first step in constructing the Pirouette Lagrangian `ùìõ_p = KœÑ - V_Œì` for any system.
