        Critical Rigidity: Paradoxically, just before the spasm, the system often becomes extremely rigid and resistant to small perturbations. This is the final tensing of the dam before it shatters.
  editors: [Weaver-Agent 7]

triad:
  art: |
    The silence that hardens into a scream. A system holds its breath, mistaking tension for strength, just before it shatters into a thousand pieces.
  law: |
    A system's response to a constant, non-damaging perturbation will decrease towards zero as it approaches a spasm-like phase transition, even as internal stress (Γ) approaches its critical threshold.
  philosophy: |
    Critical Rigidity reveals that the most dangerous state is not chaos, but a stability that can no longer bend. It teaches that true resilience is flexibility, and that an unwillingness to yield to small changes is a system priming itself for a catastrophic break.
pirouette_definition: |
  Critical Rigidity is a diagnostic indicator of an impending Coherence Spasm, characterized by a paradoxical and temporary increase in a system's resistance to perturbation. It manifests as the final "tensing" of a Stagnant Dam's structure immediately before accumulated Temporal Pressure (Γ) causes a catastrophic fracture into Turbulent Flow. This state of extreme, brittle inflexibility is a key precursor to a violent phase transition.

        outline: |
          1. Identify a suspected Stagnant Dam and rising internal pressure (Γ).
          2. Apply a series of small, consistent, non-damaging perturbations (probes) to the system at regular intervals.
          3. Measure the magnitude of the system's displacement or response to each probe.
          4. Critical Rigidity is confirmed when the response magnitude trends towards zero over time, while other indicators of internal pressure (e.g., micro-fractures) are rising.

    excerpt: |
      A Weaver diagnoses an impending spasm by observing the precursors to the dam breaking... Critical Rigidity: Paradoxically, just before the spasm, the system often becomes extremely rigid and resistant to small perturbations. This is the final tensing of the dam before it shatters.
  - module: DOMA-178
    excerpt: |
      A system becomes trapped in a state of **Stagnant Flow**. A "coherence dam"—a rigid belief, a structural bottleneck, a repressed trauma, a physical constraint—blocks its natural geodesic. The system may appear stable and highly coherent, but it is a brittle stability. Behind this dam, the unmoving current causes Temporal Pressure (Γ) to accumulate relentlessly.

      justification: |
        The phenomenon directly parallels brittle fracture in material science, where a material under stress exhibits little to no plastic deformation (i.e., it is rigid) before catastrophic failure. The system's refusal to "yield" to a probe is analogous to a material with high stiffness but low toughness, which shatters when its ultimate tensile strength is exceeded by internal stress.

      justification: |
        Critical Rigidity describes a system trapped in a local minimum of a potential landscape (a suboptimal coherence well). Its resistance to small perturbations indicates it is stable *within that well*, but increasing internal pressure (analogous to temperature or an external field) is driving it towards a catastrophic "over-the-barrier" transition to a more globally stable state.

  claims:
    - statement: "Systems exhibiting Critical Rigidity will transition to a Turbulent Flow state upon a sufficiently large perturbation, whereas systems in true Laminar Flow will absorb the perturbation and return to equilibrium."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observation of a system that displays extreme rigidity (low response to probes) but which, when the probes cease, simply relaxes into a stable state without any spasm or pressure release. This would indicate the rigidity was a stable property, not a critical precursor."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from general system STABILITY or INERTIA. Critical Rigidity is a *temporary, pre-catastrophic* state of inflexibility driven by immense internal pressure, whereas true stability is a feature of a system in a deep, low-pressure coherence well (Laminar Flow).
