  art: |
    A set of instruments to build a ledger for squandered light. It does not measure a toxin, but rather presents the universe's unyielding bill for inelegant action. The kit is a moral compass, providing an unforgiving measure of stewardship.
  law: |
    The Coherence Auditor Kit provides a complete, time-stamped, and immutable record of a system's cumulative Coherence Cost (S_ledger) by integrating the measured rate of local entropy production (Ṡ_local). The rate is a direct product of environmental pressure (Γ) and internal system dissonance (T_idx). All systemic inefficiency is accounted for by this measure.
  philosophy: |
    The CAK makes the invisible cost of chaos visible and quantifiable. By reframing "waste" as a measurable debt recorded on a permanent ledger, it transforms system maintenance from an intuitive art into a rigorous science of energetic and informational accounting. It enforces a principle of stewardship by ensuring no inefficiency goes unrecorded.
pirouette_definition: |
  A four-layer instrumentation stack used to measure a system's deviation from its path of maximal coherence. The CAK comprises a sensor layer (Temporal Signature Array) to sample environmental and system states, a processor (Coherence Engine) to calculate the Turbulence Index and entropy production rate, a ledger (Immutable Log) to record the cumulative Coherence Cost, and a diagnostic interface (Diagnostic Dashboard) for analysis. It operationalizes the Entropy Ledger concept.
operational_definition:
  units: The primary output, the Entropy Ledger (`S_ledger`), is a cumulative, dimensionless value representing total Coherence Cost. The instantaneous rate `Ṡ_local` is measured in units of entropy per unit time.

        outline: |
          1. Deploy the Temporal Signature Array to establish a baseline of local Temporal Pressure (Γ) and begin sampling the system's Ki pattern.
          2. The Coherence Engine continuously analyzes the Ki pattern to calculate the real-time Turbulence Index (T_idx).
          3. The engine computes the instantaneous Coherence Cost rate via `Ṡ_local ∝ Γ ⋅ T_idx`.
          4. Each computed value of `Ṡ_local` is integrated and appended as a time-stamped entry to the Immutable Log, updating the total `S_ledger`.
          5. The Diagnostic Dashboard visualizes `S_ledger` trends and flow state (Laminar/Turbulent) for the operator.
        expected_signals: [Ki pattern spectral data, Temporal Pressure scalar value (Γ), Turbulence Index scalar value (T_idx)]
        pitfalls: [Contamination of Γ measurement from nearby turbulent systems, miscalibration of the Ki-to-T_idx transform, data corruption in the ledger layer.]

      This protocol modernizes the old DRIK into a streamlined instrumentation stack for measuring and logging the Coherence Cost. The kit provides the practical tools for any Weaver to perform a full entropy audit on any system, at any scale.
  - module: DOMA-068
    excerpt: |
      The universe does not suffer inefficiency gladly. Every chaotic action, every turbulent process, leaves a scar on the local fabric of time. This module provides the means to measure that scar... It is the universe's accounting system for chaos, allowing a Weaver to move from intuitive diagnosis to quantitative accounting of a system's impact on its environment.

        The Coherence Cost rate (Ṡ_local) functions as the internal entropy production rate of a system. It quantifies the irreversible generation of disorder due to "frictional" or "dissipative" processes within the system, analogous to how `d_iS/dt` is always non-negative under the Second Law.

  adopted:
    - target: A specialized Data Acquisition (DAQ) system for measuring the internal Entropy Production Rate (d_iS/dt) of a system.
      rationale: This combines the operational analogy (DAQ) with the most accurate physical concept (entropy production). The CAK is the *how* (the DAQ) for measuring the *what* (the entropy production, or Coherence Cost).

      falsifier: "Discovery of a form of systemic inefficiency or 'entropic waste' that is generated by a system but does not register as a change in either its Turbulence Index or the local Temporal Pressure. This would imply the model is incomplete."

  disambiguation: |
    The CAK is the physical or logical *instrumentation stack* itself. It is distinct from the concepts it measures, such as the Coherence Cost (the waste), the Turbulence Index (an internal state), or the Entropy Ledger (the resulting record). The CAK *produces* the Entropy Ledger. It replaces the legacy "DRIK" (Dark Residue Instrumentation Kit), shifting the metaphor from a physical substance ("residue") to a financial/informational process ("audit").

# Coherence Auditor Kit

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A four-layer instrumentation stack used to measure a system's deviation from its path of maximal coherence. The CAK comprises a sensor layer (Temporal Signature Array) to sample environmental and system states, a processor (Coherence Engine) to calculate the Turbulence Index and entropy production rate, a ledger (Immutable Log) to record the cumulative Coherence Cost, and a diagnostic interface (Diagnostic Dashboard) for analysis. It operationalizes the Entropy Ledger concept.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Coherence Auditor Kit functions as a specialized Data Acquisition (DAQ) system. Its purpose is to provide a real-time measurement of a system's internal entropy production rate (`d_iS/dt`), which is termed the "Coherence Cost" within the framework. By logging this rate, it creates a permanent record of the system's thermodynamic inefficiency and deviation from an optimal, energy-minimizing path.
