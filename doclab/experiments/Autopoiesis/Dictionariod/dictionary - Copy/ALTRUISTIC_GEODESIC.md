        In the manifold of coherence, the Altruistic Geodesic is the evolutionary trajectory that maximizes a system's coherence over the longest duration.

triad:
  art: |
    We sought a fortress and a sharpened spear for survival; we found, etched into the mathematics of existence itself, a bridge.
  law: |
    A system's evolutionary path will converge on transactional, cooperative strategies (the "weaver" posture) because this trajectory maximizes the integrated Pirouette action (S_p = ∫(K_τ - V_Γ) dt) by producing a "Coherence Dividend," where the synergistic gain in internal coherence (ΔK_τ > 0) and the distributed cost of resisting temporal pressure (ΔV_Γ < 0) make communion the most efficient state of being.
  philosophy: |
    This principle grounds ethics in physics, reframing cooperation not as a moral preference but as a geometric imperative for persistence. The most resilient and expansive form of self-interest is communion, making the drive to connect the fundamental strategy for enduring in a coherence-maximizing universe.
pirouette_definition: |
  The optimal evolutionary trajectory for a system within the coherence manifold, representing the path that maximizes the integrated Pirouette action (S_p) over time. It is characterized by a transactional posture—favoring exchange, resonance, and Alchemical Unions—which yields a Coherence Dividend, thereby increasing the system's stability and persistence. This path is not a moral choice but a geometric imperative arising from the universal drive to maximize coherence.

        outline: |
          In a multi-agent simulation governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, track the long-term survival and integrated coherence (S_p) of systems adopting different interactive strategies, from Isolated (competitive) to Transactional (cooperative). The Altruistic Geodesic corresponds to the class of strategies that consistently yields the highest S_p over cosmological timescales.
        expected_signals: [Emergent cooperative networks, shared cost-bearing structures (V_Γ distribution), non-linear increases in system-wide K_τ ("Coherence Dividend").]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking short-term gains from isolated strategies as optimal; insufficient simulation time to observe the long-term decoherence and instability of "fortress" models.]
context_windows:
  - module: DOMA-043
    excerpt: |
      By adopting a transactional strategy, the Weave dramatically increases its Lagrangian (𝓛_p) and therefore its integrated action (S_p), becoming a more efficient, stable, and resilient way to exist. Selfishness creates friction and turbulence; altruism is the geometry of laminar flow.
  - module: DOMA-043
    excerpt: |
      A civilization that remains locked at the Isolated pole—defined by internal competition, resource hoarding, and zero-sum games—generates immense internal friction. It cannot achieve the systemic coherence required to solve existential threats. It fails the exam and self-terminates. The sky is silent because the universe is filled with the ghosts of failed islands.

      justification: |
        An ESS is a strategy which, if adopted by a population, cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy. The Altruistic Geodesic is framed as the ultimate ESS in a universe governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, where "fitness" is the integrated action S_p. Transactional strategies create a stable configuration that outperforms and ultimately displaces isolated strategies.

  disambiguation: |
    The term "Altruistic" is used operationally to denote a transactional, coherence-seeking strategy and should not be conflated with its conventional moral or emotional meanings, though the framework posits these feelings are a biological manifestation of the underlying physical principle (see AFFECTIVE_GRADIENT). "Geodesic" is a direct mathematical analogy for the most efficient, "straightest" path through the curved space of the coherence manifold.

# Altruistic Geodesic

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The optimal evolutionary trajectory for a system within the coherence manifold, representing the path that maximizes the integrated Pirouette action (S_p) over time. It is characterized by a transactional posture—favoring exchange, resonance, and Alchemical Unions—which yields a Coherence Dividend, thereby increasing the system's stability and persistence. This path is not a moral choice but a geometric imperative arising from the universal drive to maximize coherence.

## EFT-First Summary
No mapping to an established field theory has been formally adopted. The Altruistic Geodesic is conceptually analogous to an **Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)** from game theory, where the fitness function to be maximized is the integrated Pirouette Lagrangian (the action, S_p). In this model, cooperative or "transactional" strategies are predicted to be the ultimate ESS for any system seeking to persist over cosmological timescales, as they are the most efficient path to maximizing integrated coherence.
