  art: |
    A drawn bowstring; a promise of violence held in perfect stillness. It is the immense potential energy accumulated by a system when it is forbidden to sing its natural song. The deeper the silence, the louder the eventual note.
  law: |
    The total energy released in a resonant coherence cascade is equal to the coherence debt discharged by the system. The debt is the time-integrated suppression of a system's temporal coherence (`K_œÑ`) by a confining potential (`V_Œì`).
  philosophy: |
    Coherence Debt reframes stress and confinement not as passive states, but as the active accumulation of potential for radical transformation. It is the engine of catharsis and rupture, positing that the most profound expressions of coherence are born from the collapse of the most severe constraints.
pirouette_definition: |
  The potential energy accumulated by a system when held in a state of high confinement by an overwhelming Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`). This "debt" represents the suppressed Temporal Coherence (`K_œÑ`) of the system, which is repaid via a resonant energy release‚Äîa coherence cascade‚Äîupon the catastrophic collapse of the confining potential.

        outline: |
          Coherence Debt is not directly measurable during its accumulation phase. It is inferred by measuring the total energy of the subsequent coherence cascade.
          1. Identify a system undergoing a confinement-rupture-resonance cycle.
          2. Upon rupture, measure the total energy radiated by the system in the form of a coherent wave.
          3. Correct for energy lost to non-coherent channels (e.g., thermal dissipation). The resulting value is the discharged Coherence Debt.

        pitfalls: [Incomplete rupture leading to underestimation, energy loss to noisy/thermal channels, difficulty establishing a clear energy baseline pre-rupture]

      A system under high confinement (Gladiator Force) accumulates a 'coherence debt'; the rupture is the collapse of this confinement, resulting in the violent conversion of stored potential into a pure, resonant wave‚Äîthe coherence cascade.

    excerpt: |
      The system is forced into a path of stillness and resistance, accumulating a vast "coherence debt." It is a drawn bowstring. In this state, any small perturbation is immediately dampened. The system is stable, silent, and storing a formidable amount of potential resonance.

      rationale: |
        Coherence Debt is the potential energy stored in a system due to an external constraint (Gladiator Force), where the Lagrangian `ùìõ_p` is dominated by a large negative potential term `V_Œì`. This directly parallels the concept of potential energy (U) in classical mechanics, such as the elastic potential energy in a compressed spring, which is converted to kinetic energy upon release. The coherence cascade is the system's subsequent oscillation.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'technical debt.' Coherence Debt is a physical potential for energy release, not a metaphor for future refactoring work. Its 'repayment' is an involuntary, catastrophic energy conversion (a rupture), not a planned expenditure of effort.

# Coherence Debt

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The potential energy accumulated by a system when held in a state of high confinement by an overwhelming Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`). This "debt" represents the suppressed Temporal Coherence (`K_œÑ`) of the system, which is repaid via a resonant energy release‚Äîa coherence cascade‚Äîupon the catastrophic collapse of the confining potential.

## EFT-First Summary
In classical mechanics terms, Coherence Debt is analogous to the potential energy (U) stored by a system under an external constraint. When this constraint (the Gladiator Force) fails, this potential is converted into the kinetic energy of a coherent wave (the Coherence Cascade), similar to a compressed spring being released and oscillating. The magnitude of the debt dictates the total energy of the subsequent oscillation.
