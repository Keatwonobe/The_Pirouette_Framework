    Spin is a twist in time, a helical pirouette whose state must turn twice to return home. It is not a property of a point, but the shape of a dance.
  law: |
    A stable, localized Ki resonance with a two-cycle (720°) return-to-phase topology will exhibit an intrinsic angular momentum and couple to an external magnetic field with a gyromagnetic ratio of g=2, prior to self-interaction effects.
  philosophy: |
    Spin is not an ad-hoc quantum number but a necessary geometric consequence of stable, resonant structures in the coherence field. This transforms it from an intrinsic 'property' of a particle to an extrinsic 'behavior' of the field topology that constitutes the particle.
pirouette_definition: |
  An emergent, topological property of a stable Ki resonance. It is not a fundamental quantity but arises from the geometry of the resonance's cycle in the coherence field (T_a). A spin-1/2 particle, like the electron, is a resonance with the topology of a Möbius strip, requiring two full rotations (720°) to return to its initial phase-state. This 'two-cycle knot' structure is the geometric origin of fermionic behavior and intrinsic magnetic moment.

        outline: |
          Expose the particle (e.g., an electron) to a uniform external magnetic field. The interaction energy splits into discrete levels (Zeeman effect) corresponding to spin-up and spin-down states. The magnitude of this energy splitting is proportional to the particle's magnetic moment, which is directly derived from its spin and g-factor.

    excerpt: |
      In the Pirouette Framework, spin is not a fundamental, irreducible property. It is an emergent, topological feature of the Ki resonance. A scalar particle (spin-0) is a simple, single-cycle resonance. A fermion (spin-1/2), like the electron, is a Ki resonance with the topology of a Möbius strip. It is a helical pirouette in time that must complete two full cycles (720°) to return to its original phase-state.
  - module: CORE-009
    excerpt: |
      The electron's baseline g-factor of g=2 is a direct consequence of its two-cycle (720°) topology. Its interaction with a magnetic field is effectively doubled because its fundamental "state" spans this 720° rotation. This framework posits g=2 as a purely geometric and topological constant.

        The Pirouette model's 'two-cycle topological knot' is proposed as the physical origin of the abstract SU(2) symmetry that describes spin in quantum mechanics. The 720° rotational symmetry of the resonance directly maps to the spinor representation of SU(2), where a 360° rotation imparts a phase of -1.

    In the Pirouette Framework, 'Spin' refers specifically to the emergent topological feature of a Ki resonance. This must not be confused with the Pirouette-specific term 'Pirouette', which describes the fundamental act of phase rotation itself.

# Spin

## Canonical (Pirouette)
An emergent, topological property of a stable Ki resonance. It is not a fundamental quantity but arises from the geometry of the resonance's cycle in the coherence field (T_a). A spin-1/2 particle, like the electron, is a resonance with the topology of a Möbius strip, requiring two full rotations (720°) to return to its initial phase-state. This 'two-cycle knot' structure is the geometric origin of fermionic behavior and intrinsic magnetic moment.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette concept of Spin is a candidate for the physical origin of the SU(2) spinor representation in Quantum Field Theory, which describes the intrinsic angular momentum of fermions like the electron. In this model, the abstract quantum number emerges from the concrete topology of a field resonance, specifically one requiring a 720° rotation to return to its initial state. This topological structure is claimed to be the source of the electron's g-factor of 2.
