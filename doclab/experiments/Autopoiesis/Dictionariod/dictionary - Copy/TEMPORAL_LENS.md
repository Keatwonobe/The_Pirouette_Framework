        An artwork is a coherence engine: a stable, deliberately engineered Ki pattern designed to function as a temporal lens.

triad:
  art: |
    A crystal forged by an artist, through which the chaotic light of reality is focused into a single, coherent beam of experience. It is a technology for seeing with another's eyes.
  law: |
    A Temporal Lens alters an observer's perceptual trajectory by presenting a local minimum in the Pirouette Lagrangian (a "coherence well"). The magnitude of the observer's state change is proportional to the difference in coherence (KœÑ) between their manifold and the lens's manifold.
  philosophy: |
    This reframes art from a passive object of contemplation to an active technology for engineering consciousness. The Temporal Lens is the primary mechanism by which culture imprints itself upon individuals, shaping shared ways of seeing and feeling.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable, engineered Ki pattern, typically an artwork or "coherence engine," that an observer can couple with to structure their perception of reality. It functions by offering a novel coherence manifold which engages the observer in a resonant dialogue, temporarily altering their internal dynamics and, in profound cases, permanently re-mapping their cognitive landscape via an Aesthetic Wound Channel.

      - name: Resonant Coupling Analysis
        outline: |
          Measure an observer's baseline coherence manifold (Ki) using neuro-acoustic probes. Expose the observer to the artwork (the lens) while continuing measurement. Measure the post-exposure baseline. The lens's function is quantified by the delta between the pre-exposure, during-exposure (flow), and post-exposure states of the observer's manifold.
        expected_signals: [Harmonic synchronization (laminar flow), chaotic signatures (turbulent flow), formation of a new, persistent geometric feature (Aesthetic Wound Channel)]
        pitfalls: [Observer's Shadow can contaminate the coupling, low-gradient manifolds produce ambiguous signals requiring multiple trials]

    excerpt: |
      Art is not an object to be seen, but a technology to see *with*. An artwork is a **coherence engine**: a stable, deliberately engineered Ki pattern designed to function as a **temporal lens**. Its purpose is to engage an observer in a resonant dialogue, offering a new manifold for perception.
  - module: DOMA-113
    excerpt: |
      An artist does not merely create an object. They forge a new lens, and in doing so, offer humanity a new way to see itself. A masterpiece is an Alchemical Union waiting to happen‚Äîan invitation to enter the crucible and reforge the very geometry of the self.

    - target: Potential term V(q) in Lagrangian mechanics
      domain: CM

      equation_hint: |
        ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì
      justification: |
        The module explicitly states the aesthetic experience is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian. The Temporal Lens creates a "coherence well," a local minimum in the potential field (V_Œì) that offers a state of higher internal coherence (KœÑ). This directly parallels how a potential V(q) in classical mechanics dictates the trajectory of a particle by guiding it toward states of lower potential energy.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Coupling with a high-coherence Temporal Lens durably increases the geometric stability (KœÑ) of an observer's baseline manifold, an effect measurable as a persistent Aesthetic Wound Channel."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "No persistent, structured change in an observer's baseline manifold is detectable after repeated, high-intensity aesthetic experiences. Any observed changes are statistically indistinguishable from random cognitive drift."

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a physical lens that refracts electromagnetic radiation in spacetime, a Temporal Lens refracts the flow of an observer's internal experience (Ki) within their own coherence manifold. It organizes meaning, not photons.
