  art: |
    To map a labyrinth, one must create the map as one walks. We give the shadow a provisional face, telling a story not because it is true, but so that by following its thread, we may discover what is.
  law: |
    For any system exhibiting pathology from an unknown cause, a coherent narrative persona for the pathology must be constructed. The value of this narrative is measured exclusively by its capacity to generate unique, falsifiable hypotheses.
  philosophy: |
    The Daedalus Gambit transforms the void of ignorance into a navigable problem space. By personifying the unknown, it converts a mystery (unstructured) into a puzzle (structured and solvable), providing a disciplined framework for creative and targeted scientific inquiry.
pirouette_definition: |
  A generative, reverse-diagnostic protocol for investigating pathologies with unknown etiologies. The Gambit inverts the standard investigative process by mandating the creation of a coherent narrative persona for the pathology, termed the "antagonist." This working model, grounded in observed systemic dissonance, serves as a hypothesis engine to produce a structured and falsifiable roadmap for discovery.

        outline: |
          1. **Map Disruption:** Chart the system's observable pathologies using Flow Dynamics (laminar, turbulent, stagnant flow).
          2. **Chart Dissonance:** Formally define the known unknowns and paradoxes in a Dissonance Ledger.
          3. **Personify Antagonist:** Craft a persona for the pathology (e.g., "Resonance Thief," "Thread Cutter") based on the disruption pattern.
          4. **Write Coherence Narrative:** Synthesize the map, ledger, and persona into a concise causal story.
          5. **Trace Narrative's Echo:** Translate the narrative into a set of unique, falsifiable, and non-obvious experimental predictions.
        expected_signals: [A Coherence Narrative tagged with evidence grades, A Dissonance Ledger, A set of falsifiable hypotheses]
        pitfalls: [Narrative refactoring failure (ignoring new evidence), generating non-falsifiable predictions, allowing the narrative to obscure the Dissonance Ledger, relying on a narrative built on `Speculative` evidence for clinical theory.]
context_windows:
  - module: DOMA-097
    excerpt: |
      Where its sibling module, The Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`), moves from a known cause to its systemic effects, The Daedalus Gambit works in reverse. It begins with the disrupted flow‚Äîthe dissonant wake of an unseen pathology‚Äîand constructs a coherent narrative persona for the antagonist. This "character" and its story become a powerful engine for generating precise, falsifiable hypotheses, turning the void of ignorance into a navigable map for discovery.
  - module: DOMA-097
    excerpt: |
      To ensure the Gambit remains a tool of science and not speculation, the following guardrails are mandatory. Every claim in the narrative must be rigorously tagged with its evidence grade. The elegance of a persona must never overshadow its primary function: to generate falsifiable predictions. A story that explains everything but predicts nothing is a failure of the protocol.

      justification: |
        The Daedalus Gambit is a structured methodology for hypothesizing the functional form of an unknown, disruptive potential term (`V_pathology`) within a system's Lagrangian. The observed pathology is interpreted as the system's new trajectory under the influence of this term. The Gambit's output (the Coherence Narrative) is a qualitative model for `V_pathology`.

  disambiguation: |
    The name refers to Daedalus, the mythical craftsman who navigated the labyrinth he created, symbolizing the act of creating a conceptual map to navigate an unknown and complex problem. The "Gambit" denotes a strategic opening move that accepts a provisional risk (adopting a likely-false narrative) to gain a significant positional advantage (a focused, falsifiable research program).

# The Daedalus Gambit

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A generative, reverse-diagnostic protocol for investigating pathologies with unknown etiologies. The Gambit inverts the standard investigative process by mandating the creation of a coherent narrative persona for the pathology, termed the "antagonist." This working model, grounded in observed systemic dissonance, serves as a hypothesis engine to produce a structured and falsifiable roadmap for discovery.

## EFT-First Summary
The Daedalus Gambit is a methodology for defining the functional form of a disruptive potential term, `V_pathology`, added to a system's Lagrangian (`ùìõ'_p = K_œÑ - (V_Œì + V_pathology)`). By observing the pathological behavior of the system (its "tragic geodesic"), the protocol constructs a qualitative model of the unknown disruptive potential. This model, or "Coherence Narrative," is then used to predict other, non-obvious system behaviors that can be experimentally tested, thereby refining the mathematical form of `V_pathology`.
