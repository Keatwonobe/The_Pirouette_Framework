    The whisper before the whirlwind. It is the point where societal eddies lock into a single vortex, signaling the dam is about to break.
  law: |
    A systemic cascade event is imminent if the total antagonistic circulation, measured by the loop integral of the Dissonance Field `∮ D⋅dl`, exceeds a system-specific but invariant threshold Θ.
  philosophy: |
    Θ marks the boundary between recoverable strain and irreversible phase transition. It asserts that societal collapse is not random but a predictable geometric event, a failure of coherence heralded by the buildup of rotational, non-productive social energy.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Curl Threshold, Θ, is a scalar quantity representing the maximum sustainable antagonistic circulation within a socio-physical system. It is defined as the critical value of the loop integral of the Dissonance Field `D` (`∮ D⋅dl`). When this integral, representing the total 'vorticity' of social friction and non-cooperative loops, exceeds Θ, the system is predicted to undergo a cascade failure or phase transition.

    excerpt: |
      The Halo Test predicts that curl magnitude exceeds threshold (Θ) prior to systemic cascade events. Measurement involves computing the loop integral `∮ D⋅dl` and identifying cascade onset when `∮ D⋅dl > Θ`. This provides a concrete, falsifiable test for the theory's predictive power regarding social instability.
  - module: SOCIO-FIELD-001
    excerpt: |
      Future work in [SOCIO-FIELD-002] defines the curl threshold (Θ) more formally and provides a framework for intervention simulations. This links the diagnostic power of Θ to prescriptive policy actions designed to mitigate cascade risks by disrupting antagonistic circulation before it reaches the critical threshold.

        Θ acts analogously to a critical Reynolds number in fluid dynamics. While Re marks the transition from laminar to turbulent flow based on the ratio of inertial to viscous forces, Θ marks the transition from stable social circulation to a chaotic cascade based on the total magnitude of antagonistic (curl) flow. Both are dimensionless thresholds predicting a systemic change in behavior.

# Curl Threshold

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Curl Threshold, Θ, is a scalar quantity representing the maximum sustainable antagonistic circulation within a socio-physical system. It is defined as the critical value of the loop integral of the Dissonance Field `D` (`∮ D⋅dl`). When this integral, representing the total 'vorticity' of social friction and non-cooperative loops, exceeds Θ, the system is predicted to undergo a cascade failure or phase transition.

## EFT-First Summary
The Curl Threshold `Θ` is the Pirouette equivalent of a critical Reynolds number, signaling a phase transition in a social system. It quantifies the point at which antagonistic circulation—non-productive, looping flows of information or resources—overwhelms the system's coherent structure, triggering a turbulent cascade. This threshold is not a force, but a dimensionless measure of total rotational stress derived from the curl of the Dissonance Field.
