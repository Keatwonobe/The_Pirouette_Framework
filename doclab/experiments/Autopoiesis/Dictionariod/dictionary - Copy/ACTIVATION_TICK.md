        At molecular and chemical scales, the snap defines the discrete **activation tick**:
        each bond rearrangement or phase flip is the minimal Ki-transition event converting stored coherence into motion.

  art: |
    The universe inhales potential into a coiled spring of coherence, then exhales with a sudden snap. The activation tick is this quantized breath of change, the smallest possible step from being to becoming.
  law: |
    An activation tick occurs when the composite driver Ξ exceeds a critical threshold Ξ_c, triggering a topological snap from the Ki_rest to the Ki_motion state. This transition releases a quantized energy packet E_snap and governs reaction intervals τ = h/(E_snap Ki).
  philosophy: |
    The Activation Tick establishes that transformation is not a smooth continuum but a series of discrete, indivisible steps. It posits a universal metronome governing all change, from chemical bonds to inertial leaps, rooting the arrow of time in the fundamental geometry of coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The minimal, quantized event of transformation, such as a chemical reaction or phase transition. An Activation Tick is driven by a Ki-snap, a topological transition from the 4π (Ki_rest) to the 2π (Ki_motion) manifold, which occurs when a system's composite driver (Ξ) crosses a critical threshold. This converts stored coherence into kinetic energy or structural rearrangement.

        outline: |
          Measure the time intervals between discrete events in a controlled chemical reaction or phase transition using single-molecule spectroscopy. Perform a statistical analysis (e.g., Fourier transform or power spectral density) on the resulting time-series data.
        expected_signals: [Clustering of reaction intervals around integer multiples of a fundamental period τ = h/(E_snap Ki), Sharp peaks in the frequency-domain analysis corresponding to 1/τ.]
        pitfalls: [Thermal noise masking the quantized signal, System complexity introducing multiple, overlapping τ values which broaden the peaks.]

    excerpt: |
      At molecular and chemical scales, the snap defines the discrete **activation tick**: each bond rearrangement or phase flip is the minimal Ki-transition event converting stored coherence into motion. The same hysteresis that governs cosmic topology governs molecular kinetics, making Ki the metronome of transformation.
  - module: MATH-023
    excerpt: |
      Crossing Ξ_c triggers the **snap**—a topological shift from the 4π manifold to the 2π triadic manifold. This tether-snap pair forms the microscopic analog of the cosmological 4π↔2π “kick.” At molecular scales, the snap defines the discrete activation tick.

        Rate ∝ exp(-E_a/kT)  vs.  Rate ∝ 1/τ = E_snap·Ki/h
      justification: |
        The Activation Tick provides a candidate mechanism for the microscopic events that ensemble averaging describes as crossing an activation energy (E_a) barrier. Pirouette posits that this is not a smooth probabilistic climb over a potential, but a discrete topological snap. The energy of the snap, E_snap, plays a role analogous to E_a.

  claims:
    - statement: "The time intervals between individual molecular reaction events are not continuously distributed (e.g., exponentially) but are quantized, clustering around a fundamental period τ = h/(E_snap Ki)."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "High-resolution single-molecule kinetic studies showing a smooth, continuous (e.g., perfect exponential) distribution of reaction waiting times, with no evidence of clustering at any characteristic frequency."

  collisions: [Clock tick (computing)]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a computational 'clock tick.' An Activation Tick is not a measure of time itself, but a discrete physical event *in* time that marks a state change. It is the 'tock' of a process, not the 'tick' of a clock.
