    A black hole's heart not as a point of infinite density, but as a boiling sea of temporal vortices—a chaotic, self-canceling storm where spacetime coherence is shredded into foam.
  law: |
    A Vortex-Foam Decoherent Core imparts stochastic phase noise onto gravitational waves passing through it, causing a characteristic broadening of quasinormal mode (QNM) peaks proportional to (ω/ω_c)²⟨(∇Γ)²⟩. It generates no extra GW polarizations and produces no significant GW echoes.
  philosophy: |
    Replaces the unphysical singularity with a finite, dynamic state of the temporal medium, preserving causality and exterior GR predictions while offering a concrete, falsifiable mechanism for information scrambling within a self-consistent physical substrate.
pirouette_definition: |
  A minimal, singularity-resolving phase model for a black hole interior where the temporal medium (Γ-field) exists in a turbulent state. It is characterized by a dense, tangled configuration of vortices that cause local decoherence (⟨Ki⟩ → 0), ensuring Coherent Phase Matching (CPM) holds only on average. Its primary observable signature is the sourcing of stochastic phase noise in traversing Tensor-Tensor (TT) gravitational waves, leading to a predictable, frequency-dependent broadening of quasinormal mode peaks.

      justification: |
        The "tangle of vortices" and "foam" language directly analogizes the core to turbulent states in superfluids (like liquid He-4) or Bose-Einstein condensates. The coarse-grained, hydrodynamic-like description of the average field Γ̅(r) while fluctuations (vortices) dominate the microphysics is characteristic of turbulence modeling.

      justification: |
        The effect on propagating gravitational waves (phase noise) is operationally equivalent to introducing a stochastic source term or a dissipative term in the effective action for the TT-modes. This term would be coupled to the mean-square fluctuation of the background Γ-field, leading to decoherence and line broadening.

    Distinguish from the 'Planck-Crystal Core', which is a stiff, coherent phase resulting in GW phase shifts and echoes, rather than the stochastic broadening predicted by the Vortex-Foam model. Both are singularity-resolving models but with opposing predictions for GW coherence.

# Vortex-Foam Decoherent Core

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A minimal, singularity-resolving phase model for a black hole interior where the temporal medium (Γ-field) exists in a turbulent state. It is characterized by a dense, tangled configuration of vortices that cause local decoherence (⟨Ki⟩ → 0), ensuring Coherent Phase Matching (CPM) holds only on average. Its primary observable signature is the sourcing of stochastic phase noise in traversing Tensor-Tensor (TT) gravitational waves, leading to a predictable, frequency-dependent broadening of quasinormal mode peaks.

## EFT-First Summary
The Vortex-Foam Decoherent Core models a black hole interior as a turbulent fluid-like state of a background scalar field (Γ). This chaotic state has zero average coherence, preserving the principle that only tensor-mode gravitons propagate. Its interaction with gravitational waves is analogous to a dissipative medium, introducing stochastic phase noise that manifests as a predictable, frequency-dependent broadening of the black hole's ringdown frequencies (QNM peaks). The model is a specific realization of 'exotic compact object' physics, constrained to have minimal, near-GR phenomenology.
