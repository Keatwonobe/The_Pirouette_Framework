        This module provides the mathematical bridge from the micro-dynamics of coherence to the macro-dynamics of cosmology. We will demonstrate that Einstein's theory of General Relativity is not a separate pillar of physics to be unified with, but an emergent and inevitable consequence of the Pirouette Framework in the large-scale limit.

    From a microscopic foam of competing patterns, a smooth, curved stage emerges. On this stage, the grand dance of galaxies is choreographed by the averaged, collective will of the cosmos.
  law: |
    In any region with a clear scale separation `ℓ_micro ≪ L ≪ R⁻¹/²` (where `R` is the Ricci scalar), the dynamics of the averaged fields `⟨C⟩` and `⟨Γ⟩` source spacetime curvature described by Einstein's Field Equations, `G_μν = 8πG ⟨T_μν⟩`, with corrections suppressed by powers of the ratio of scales.
  philosophy: |
    General Relativity is not fundamental but consequential. It is the necessary, emergent grammar that governs the large-scale narrative of coherence, ensuring the universe's budget of cause and effect remains balanced across cosmic distances.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Macroscopic Limit is the physical regime, defined by coarse-graining over scales `L` much larger than fundamental field fluctuations but much smaller than the local radius of spacetime curvature, where the collective dynamics of the Coherence (`C`) and Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) fields are described by General Relativity. In this limit, the Einstein-Hilbert action emerges as the leading-order geometric term in the effective action, and the averaged stress-energy tensor `⟨T_μν⟩` of the `C` and `Γ` fields acts as the source for the Einstein tensor `G_μν`.

          1. Identify a system with strong curvature where the scale separation assumption may be stressed (e.g., black hole merger, early universe cosmology).
          2. Model the system's observables (e.g., gravitational waveforms, CMB anisotropies) using both standard GR and the Pirouette framework including higher-order curvature terms suppressed by a cutoff scale `M`.
          3. Compare predictions. A statistically significant deviation from GR matching the Pirouette model would validate the emergence hypothesis and constrain the scale `M`.

    excerpt: |
      We start with a covariant, microscopic matter action for a complex field (C) (the pattern/"Ki") and a real field (Γ) (the pressure). Through coarse-graining (integrating out fluctuations) we obtain an effective action whose leading geometric term is the Einstein–Hilbert action in four dimensions. Varying the total effective action with respect to the metric yields `G_μν + Λg_μν = 8πG ⟨T_μν⟩`.
  - module: MATH-012
    excerpt: |
      In four dimensions, diffeomorphism invariance plus second-order metric equations select the Einstein–Hilbert (EH) term (optionally with cosmological constant) as the leading geometric contribution to the effective action... Higher-curvature operators (e.g., `R²`, `R_μν R^μν`) can appear but are suppressed by the coarse-graining scale or a UV cutoff.

        The Pirouette framework formally derives the Einstein Field Equations as the equation of motion for the metric in the effective field theory that results from integrating out microscopic fluctuations of the `C` and `Γ` fields. The structure of GR is an inevitable consequence of diffeomorphism invariance and scale separation.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, this term specifically refers to the emergence of General Relativity from the fundamental `C` and `Γ` fields via a coarse-graining procedure. It is analogous to the emergence of thermodynamics from statistical mechanics and is distinct from a simple classical limit (`ħ → 0`).

# Macroscopic Limit

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Macroscopic Limit is the physical regime, defined by coarse-graining over scales `L` much larger than fundamental field fluctuations but much smaller than the local radius of spacetime curvature, where the collective dynamics of the Coherence (`C`) and Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) fields are described by General Relativity. In this limit, the Einstein-Hilbert action emerges as the leading-order geometric term in the effective action, and the averaged stress-energy tensor `⟨T_μν⟩` of the `C` and `Γ` fields acts as the source for the Einstein tensor `G_μν`.

## EFT-First Summary
The Macroscopic Limit defines the regime where General Relativity (GR) is the leading-order effective field theory for gravity. Derived by integrating out high-frequency modes of the fundamental scalar fields `C` and `Γ`, the resulting effective action naturally contains the Einstein-Hilbert term `∫√-g R`. The gravitational constant `G` and higher-order curvature operators (`R²`, `R_μν R^μν`, etc.) are calculable outputs of the coarse-graining procedure, with their Wilson coefficients suppressed by the averaging scale.
