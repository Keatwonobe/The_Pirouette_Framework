        D8 — Hadronic Insulation via Ratios
        Publish at least one parameter-free **dimensionless ratio** that cancels leading hadronic VP, e.g.
        R = (a_μ − r² a_e) / (a_τ − r⁻² a_μ), r = m_μ/m_e.
        Any hadronic dependence must appear only at higher order with quantified bounds.

  art: |
    A signal is wrapped in a cloak woven from its own family's properties, rendering it invisible to the chaotic noise of the strong force. It passes through the hadronic storm untouched, carrying a pure message from the underlying laws.
  law: |
    Construct at least one parameter-free, dimensionless ratio of observables from a common family (e.g., lepton g-2) designed to cancel leading-order hadronic uncertainties. The residual hadronic dependence must be demonstrably higher-order and its uncertainty bounded.
  philosophy: |
    To achieve true predictivity, one must replace confrontation with non-perturbative noise with elegant evasion. Hadronic Insulation structurally removes the largest theoretical uncertainty from key precision tests, transforming them from messy QCD battlegrounds into clean probes of new physics or fundamental symmetries.
pirouette_definition: |
  A technique for constructing dimensionless ratios of observables that are structurally insensitive to leading-order hadronic effects, particularly hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP). The ratio `R` is formed from members of a homologous series (e.g., anomalous magnetic moments of leptons `e`, `μ`, `τ`) and their mass ratios, such that the dominant HVP contributions, which scale predictably with mass, cancel. This method is mandated by `MATH-018 (D8)` to ensure that at least one core prediction of the framework is robust against the largest source of non-perturbative QCD uncertainty.

        outline: |
          1. Select a family of observables `O_i` (e.g., `a_e`, `a_μ`, `a_τ`) where the leading hadronic uncertainty contribution `ΔO_i^had` scales with a known function of a parameter `p_i` (e.g., `Δa_l^had ∝ m_l²`).
          2. Form a dimensionless ratio `R` from `O_i` and `p_i` that formally cancels `ΔO_i^had` at leading order.
          3. Calculate the Pirouette prediction for `R`, which is now free from this uncertainty.
          4. Obtain high-precision experimental measurements for the components `O_i` and `p_i`.
          5. Compute the experimental value of `R` and its uncertainty.
          6. Test for agreement between the predicted and measured `R`. The residual uncertainty should be dominated by experimental errors and quantifiable higher-order theory errors.
        expected_signals:
          - A statistically significant agreement between the predicted and measured value of `R`.
          - The uncertainty on the experimental `R` is substantially smaller than the hadronic uncertainty on its most sensitive individual component (e.g., `a_μ`).
        pitfalls:
          - The assumed scaling law for the hadronic contribution is incorrect or has large, unknown higher-order corrections.
          - Correlated experimental errors in the measurement of the ratio's components are underestimated.

        Hadronic Insulation is a specific physical application of the general statistical principle of constructing an observable that is, by its structure, insensitive to a poorly constrained nuisance parameter. Here, the HVP is treated as the nuisance parameter, and its known scaling properties are exploited for cancellation.

    Distinguish from the "R-ratio" (`σ(e⁺e⁻→hadrons)/σ(e⁺e⁻→μ⁺μ⁻)`), which is used to *measure* hadronic effects, whereas Hadronic Insulation is used to *cancel* their effect in other observables. This is about removing, not measuring, the hadronic contribution.

# Hadronic Insulation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A technique for constructing dimensionless ratios of observables that are structurally insensitive to leading-order hadronic effects, particularly hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP). The ratio `R` is formed from members of a homologous series (e.g., anomalous magnetic moments of leptons `e`, `μ`, `τ`) and their mass ratios, such that the dominant HVP contributions, which scale predictably with mass, cancel. This method is mandated by `MATH-018 (D8)` to ensure that at least one core prediction of the framework is robust against the largest source of non-perturbative QCD uncertainty.

## EFT-First Summary
Hadronic Insulation is a technique for constructing specific dimensionless ratios of precision observables to cancel leading-order Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) uncertainty. This is a form of creating a **nuisance-free observable**, where the "nuisance" is the non-perturbative QCD contribution to quantities like the lepton anomalous magnetic moments (`g-2`). By exploiting the approximate `m_l²` mass-scaling of the HVP's effect on `a_l`, a combination like `a_μ - (m_μ/m_e)² a_e` can be made significantly less sensitive to hadronic physics, enabling a cleaner, more stringent test of the electroweak or other new physics sectors.
