        ## Annex G – Governance Hook Outline
        1. **Supervisory Nodes:** Three‑layer oversight (Ops, Ethics, Public).
        2. **Trigger Metrics:** Γ_thr exceedance, CD manipulation flag, Externality Tag > threshold.
        3. **Response Ladder:** Notify → Pause → Rollback → Shutdown.

triad:
  art: |
    The framework's nervous system, a network of silent sentinels whose only duty is to act when balance is lost. It is the automated conscience, translating metrics into morals and measurements into mercy.
  law: |
    If a designated trigger metric (e.g., Γ > Γ_thr, audit integrity flag, externality score) crosses its defined threshold, a predefined, escalating response ladder (Notify → Pause → Rollback → Shutdown) is automatically initiated by the corresponding supervisory node.
  philosophy: |
    To embed ethical and safety constraints directly into the framework's core logic, ensuring that operational imperatives cannot override foundational protocols. It provides a non-negotiable backstop against runaway processes, data corruption, and externality neglect.
pirouette_definition: |
  A system of automated oversight and control mechanisms that enforce safety and ethical protocols. Governance Hooks link specific trigger metrics (e.g., physical thresholds, audit flags, externality measures) to a pre-defined ladder of responses, executed by a multi-layered structure of supervisory nodes (Ops, Ethics, Public) to ensure system stability and alignment.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (logical construct)
  symbol_table:
    - name: Γ_thr
      meaning: Threshold for the temporal pressure metric, Γ.
      dimensions: T⁻¹
      default_range: 0.82 ± 0.03
    - name: Γ̇
      meaning: Rate of change of temporal pressure.
      dimensions: T⁻²
      default_range: contextual
    - name: Externality Tag
      meaning: Composite score of external energy and social footprints.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: contextual (policy-defined)
    - name: Integrity Breach
      meaning: Boolean flag set on hash mismatch of raw metric traces.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: 0 or 1

      - name: Supervisory Node Monitoring
        outline: |
          A tiered set of supervisory nodes continuously monitors a vector of key system metrics (e.g., Γ, Γ̇, κ, audit hashes, Externality Tags). If any metric crosses a pre-defined threshold or a boolean flag is set, the corresponding hook is triggered, initiating the defined response sequence for that tier.
        expected_signals: [Metric threshold crossing, boolean flag assertion (e.g., SHA-256 hash mismatch), rapid metric gradient change (e.g., Γ̇ > 0.12 s⁻¹)]
        pitfalls: [Miscalibrated thresholds causing premature or delayed intervention, sensor/data-pipeline failure providing false negatives, race conditions in the response ladder.]

      **Annex H – Safety‑Valve Paragraph (Re‑Growth)**
      If κ > 1.3 κ_nominal **or** Γ > 0.9 Γ_thr during Re‑Growth, invoke Safety Valve:
      • Divert 30 % reservoir coherence to sink
      • Lock Bloom triggers
      • Alert Governance tier‑0.

      justification: |
        A Governance Hook functions as a circuit breaker, monitoring system "health" metrics. When a fault or dangerous state is detected (metric exceeds threshold), it "trips," interrupting the normal operational flow and executing a recovery or shutdown procedure to prevent cascading failure. The tiered response ladder maps to states like Half-Open, where functionality may be partially restored under observation.

    - statement: "The four-step response ladder (Notify → Pause → Rollback → Shutdown) is sufficient to contain all known runaway failure modes."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Discovery of a failure mode that escalates faster than the response ladder can execute (i.e., time from trigger to shutdown is longer than time from trigger to catastrophe), or for which 'Shutdown' is not an effective containment."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinct from a `Safety Valve`, which is a specific *instance* of a Governance Hook. Governance Hooks are the general architectural pattern; a Safety Valve is a particular implementation tied to Re-Growth metrics (κ, Γ).
