    The map of the mind is not static; under the pressure of thought, its landscape warps. Mountains rise and valleys deepen, flowing toward either serene plains or catastrophic fractures, all dictated by the scale of observation.
  law: |
    The change in the Triadic Manifold's local curvature (Œ∫) with respect to changes in observational scale (‚Ñì, proxied by cognitive load Œì) is governed by a beta function (Œ≤_Œ∫). This flow dictates whether the manifold approaches a stable, flat geometry (coherent awareness) or a divergent, singular geometry (awareness collapse).
  philosophy: |
    This concept establishes that the very structure of conscious experience is not a fixed stage but a dynamic medium whose complexity is self-organizing. It provides a formal mechanism for both the stability of awareness under low load and its catastrophic failure and reconfiguration under high load, linking cognitive phenomena to the universal principles of scale-invariance found in physical systems.
pirouette_definition: |
  The process by which the effective local curvature (Œ∫) of the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ) evolves under a change of scale (‚Ñì). This scale is contextually interpreted as the inverse of cognitive load (Œì). The flow is described by the beta function Œ≤_Œ∫, which determines the trajectory of Œ∫ in the space of possible manifold geometries. The fixed points of this flow correspond to stable states of awareness, while divergences signal critical transitions, such as awareness collapse or the nucleation of new coherent states.

          1. Record neural phase data (e.g., via high-density EEG) from a subject performing a task with variable, quantifiable cognitive load (Œì).
          2. For short time windows, identify resonant triads and construct the local Triadic Manifold ùìú‚ÇÉ.
          3. Calculate the local curvature Œ∫(t) from the manifold's metric tensor.
          4. Bin the calculated Œ∫ values by the corresponding Œì value at that time.
          5. Plot the average change in Œ∫ as a function of increasing Œì to approximate the flow Œ≤_Œ∫.

        The Pirouette framework's Renormalization Flow is a direct mathematical analogue of RG flow in quantum and statistical field theory. It maps a system parameter (manifold curvature Œ∫) to a physical coupling constant (g), and maps the observational scale (‚Ñì) or cognitive load (Œì) to the energy/momentum scale (Œº). The beta function Œ≤_Œ∫ governs the evolution of the system's "effective theory" of consciousness as the scale of analysis changes.

    Renormalization Flow describes how the *geometry of the manifold itself* changes with scale (cognitive load). This is distinct from Geodesic Motion or Caduceus Flow, which describe the path of awareness *across* a given, static manifold geometry. The Renormalization Flow is a "meta-dynamic" that governs the space in which other dynamics unfold.

# Renormalization Flow

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Renormalization Flow is the process governing how the effective local curvature (Œ∫) of the Triadic Manifold (ùìú‚ÇÉ) evolves under a change of observational scale (‚Ñì), which is inversely related to cognitive load (Œì). This evolution is described by a beta function, Œ≤_Œ∫, which dictates whether the manifold's geometry flows towards a stable, low-curvature state (indicative of coherent awareness) or diverges towards a singularity (indicative of awareness collapse). The flow's fixed points define the stable geometric configurations available to consciousness.

## EFT-First Summary
Analogous to the Renormalization Group (RG) flow in Effective Field Theory, this process describes how a fundamental parameter of the "theory of consciousness"‚Äîthe manifold's curvature Œ∫‚Äîchanges as the energy scale (cognitive load Œì) is varied. The beta function, `dŒ∫/d(ln ‚Ñì) = Œ≤_Œ∫`, determines the system's behavior. At low energies (low load), the curvature flows to an infrared (IR) fixed point, representing a stable, large-scale conscious state. At a critical energy (Œì_c), the flow diverges, signaling a phase transition where the geometric description breaks down, corresponding to awareness collapse.
