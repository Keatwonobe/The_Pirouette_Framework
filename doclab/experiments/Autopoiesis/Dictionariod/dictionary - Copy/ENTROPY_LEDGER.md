        The cumulative **Entropy Ledger** (`S_ledger`) is the integral of this rate over time. It is the running tally of the system's temporal debt—the total amount of order it has converted into noise.

triad:
  art: |
    A ledger for squandered light, measuring the scar tissue left on time by inefficient action. It is the unforgiving record of a system's deviation from grace.
  law: |
    The Entropy Ledger is the time-integral of the Coherence Cost (`Ṡ_local`), which is the rate of entropic waste generated by a system. Its accumulation is directly proportional to the product of ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) and the system's internal Turbulence Index (`T_idx`). A non-zero rate of increase indicates a system is operating inefficiently off its geodesic.
  philosophy: |
    The ledger transforms systemic health from a qualitative assessment into a quantitative, auditable fact. It serves as a moral compass for a Weaver, providing an objective measure of stewardship by accounting for not only what a system has accomplished, but the cost of that accomplishment in wasted coherence.
pirouette_definition: |
  An immutable, auditable log that records the cumulative Coherence Cost (entropic waste) generated by a system over time. As the time-integral of the local entropy production rate (`Ṡ_local`), the ledger quantifies a system's total deviation from its path of maximal coherence. It provides a definitive balance sheet for systemic health and temporal debt.

        outline: |
          1.  Deploy a Temporal Signature Array to sample the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) and the system's resonant Ki pattern.
          2.  Feed the Ki signal into a Coherence Engine to compute the real-time Turbulence Index (`T_idx`).
          3.  Calculate the instantaneous Coherence Cost (`Ṡ_local`) from Γ and `T_idx`.
          4.  Integrate `Ṡ_local` over time and append the new cumulative `S_ledger` value to an Immutable Log with a timestamp.
        expected_signals: [Ki pattern spectrum, temporal pressure scalar]
        pitfalls: [Signal contamination from adjacent systems, miscalibration of the Coherence Engine leading to inaccurate `T_idx` values.]

  - module: DOMA-068
    excerpt: |
      By applying the principles of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001) and the framework's understanding of information (CORE-013), this module establishes the **Entropy Ledger**, a formal instrumentation protocol for auditing this cost. It is the universe's accounting system for chaos, allowing a Weaver to move from intuitive diagnosis to quantitative accounting of a system's impact on its environment.
  - module: DOMA-068
    excerpt: |
      The cumulative **Entropy Ledger** (`S_ledger`) is the integral of this rate over time. It is the running tally of the system's temporal debt—the total amount of order it has converted into noise. For practical field applications, `Ṡ_local` can often be approximated by measuring **Frictional Loss (Φ_f)**, where `Φ_f = (Total Energy Expended) - (Coherent Work Performed)`.
  - module: DOMA-068
    excerpt: |
      The Entropy Ledger is the accounting system for the **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)**... A system in perfect **Laminar Flow** is successfully tracking this ideal path (`S_actual ≈ S_ideal`). Its actions are elegant, its Coherence Cost is minimal, and its entry in the Entropy Ledger is clean.

      justification: |
        In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, irreversible entropy production measures the "wasted" potential of a process, analogous to Coherence Cost. The ledger, as the integral of this cost, directly maps to the total accumulated irreversible entropy of a system's history. It quantifies the degree to which a process has failed to be thermodynamically optimal.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish `S_ledger`, the cumulative stock of temporal debt, from `Ṡ_local` (Coherence Cost), the rate of its accumulation. Differentiate from `S_p`, the Pirouette Action, which represents the ideal path of *maximized* coherence, not squandered potential.
