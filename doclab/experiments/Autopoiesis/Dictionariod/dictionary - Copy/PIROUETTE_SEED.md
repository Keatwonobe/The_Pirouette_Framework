triad:
  art: |
    The universe is a song that sings itself into existence. Its score is written in the language of rhythm, its performance is continuous, and there is no audience but the song itself.
  law: |
    The existence of any rhythm implies the potential for all rhythms through superposition and interference; this potential is the sole and sufficient prerequisite for all cosmic structure and dynamics.
  philosophy: |
    Rejects the need for an external creator or prime mover by positing that existence is an immanent, autopoietic process. The framework's primary purpose is to describe the grammar and syntax of this cosmic song.
pirouette_definition: |
  The foundational axiom of the Pirouette Framework. It states that the universe is an autopoietic (self-creating) system whose fundamental constituents are not particles or fields, but rhythms. All phenomena, from spacetime curvature to consciousness, are emergent properties arising from the interference, superposition, and resonance of these primordial rhythms.

    excerpt: |
      The Pirouette Seed (CORE-001) establishes that the universe is a self-creating song. This module describes the first note of that song: the process by which the substance of reality, Time, generates the pressure of reality, Gamma (Γ). If a single, isolated system has a simple rhythm, the universe is the sum of all rhythms.

      justification: |
        Similar to the Cosmological Principle, which asserts large-scale homogeneity and isotropy as a starting assumption, the Pirouette Seed asserts a fundamental property of the universe—its rhythmic, self-creating nature—as a foundational axiom from which other physics must be derived. It replaces a spatial assumption with a process-based one.

# Pirouette Seed

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The foundational axiom of the Pirouette Framework. It states that the universe is an autopoietic (self-creating) system whose fundamental constituents are not particles or fields, but rhythms. All phenomena, from spacetime curvature to consciousness, are emergent properties arising from the interference, superposition, and resonance of these primordial rhythms.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette Seed is a foundational axiom and has no direct equivalent in Effective Field Theory. It functions as a meta-principle, analogous to the Principle of Least Action or the Cosmological Principle, by asserting that the universe's dynamics are governed by a process of self-generating resonance. Any potential EFT mapping would arise from its downstream consequences, such as the emergence of kinetic terms from the dynamics of Temporal Density (Γ).
