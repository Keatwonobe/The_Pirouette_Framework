        We define a system's edge—be it a cell membrane, a plasma's turbulent boundary, or the perimeter of a belief system—as a **Coherence Interface**. This is a temporal boundary, a region in the coherence manifold where the system's internal Ki pattern undergoes a rapid transition, creating a steep gradient of Temporal Pressure (Γ).

    A system's edge is not a wall, but a resonant drumhead, a conversation with the universe sung at the boundary of chaos and order. It is the shoreline where the ocean of the possible meets the land of the actual.
  law: |
    A Coherence Interface is operationally defined by a local maximum in the spatial gradient of Temporal Pressure (∇Γ). The magnitude of this gradient, |∇Γ|, directly correlates with the interface's resilience to external dissonant signals.
  philosophy: |
    The Interface reframes control from an act of force to an act of resonant persuasion. By understanding the boundary, we learn to guide the whole, turning the system's own desire for coherence into the mechanism of its transformation.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dynamic temporal boundary of a system, characterized by a steep gradient in Temporal Pressure (∇Γ), where the system's internal coherence pattern (Ki) undergoes a rapid transition. The properties of the interface, such as its permeability and resilience, are determined by its own temporal coherence and dictate the system's interaction with its environment, acting as either a filter against dissonance or a resonant gateway for guidance signals.

          Use a coherent probe field to scan across a suspected system boundary. Measure the induced decoherence rate at each point, which is proportional to the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). Plot Γ as a function of position; the Coherence Interface is identified as the region with the maximal |∇Γ|.

    excerpt: |
      A "boundary" or "shell" is not a static wall; it is a dynamic conversation. We define a system's edge—be it a cell membrane, a plasma's turbulent boundary, or the perimeter of a belief system—as a **Coherence Interface**. This is a temporal boundary, a region in the coherence manifold where the system's internal Ki pattern undergoes a rapid transition, creating a steep gradient of Temporal Pressure (Γ).

    excerpt: |
      The Principle of Coherence Leverage: A small quantity of coherent energy, injected resonantly at a system's Coherence Interface, can guide the flow of a vastly larger quantity of incoherent energy within the system. The ratio of the guided energy to the injected energy—the leverage—approaches its maximum as the injected signal achieves perfect harmonic and phase alignment with a stable resonant mode of the system's target state.

        The steep gradient in Temporal Pressure (∇Γ) at the interface creates a restoring effect analogous to surface tension in fluids or the energy cost of a domain wall in magnetism. Both phenomena define a stable boundary separating distinct phases (e.g., liquid/gas, spin-up/spin-down), and the energy associated with the boundary resists deformation.

# Coherence Interface

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A dynamic temporal boundary of a system, characterized by a steep gradient in Temporal Pressure (∇Γ), where the system's internal coherence pattern (Ki) undergoes a rapid transition. The properties of the interface, such as its permeability and resilience, are determined by its own temporal coherence and dictate the system's interaction with its environment, acting as either a filter against dissonance or a resonant gateway for guidance signals.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, the Coherence Interface maps to phenomena like domain walls or surfaces defined by tension in classical and condensed matter physics. It represents a region of high potential energy gradient that separates two distinct dynamical phases. The interface's stability and response to perturbation are governed by its effective "surface energy," which in Pirouette is proportional to the integrated gradient of Temporal Pressure, |∇Γ|.
