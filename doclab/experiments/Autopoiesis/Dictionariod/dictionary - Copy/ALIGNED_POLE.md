  art: |
    The chorus that sings a single note, the army that marches as one body. It is the silent agreement of atoms in a crystal, turning chaotic vibration into immutable structure. Alignment is the disciplined focus that transforms a crowd into a force.
  law: |
    The net external work potential of a system is proportional to the degree of its internal Alignment. A system's internal order (negentropy) can be converted into coherent external action, while disorder (entropy) cannot.
  philosophy: |
    Alignment is the principle of construction and focus in the universe. It is the necessary counterpoint to the dissipative tendency of the Random Pole (Entropy), enabling the formation of stable, complex structures from atoms to ideas. Without Alignment, information cannot persist, and intention cannot be enacted.
pirouette_definition: |
  The state on the Cohesion axis where a system's components, dynamics, or intentions act in a coherent, ordered, or correlated manner. Alignment enables the summation of component vectors into a unified, focused effect, creating macro-level properties that are absent in the disordered state. It represents the ordering principle that allows for the creation of complex, stable patterns.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless. Typically normalized on the Cohesion axis from [-1, 1], where +1 is maximally Aligned and -1 is maximally Random.

        outline: |
          For a system of N components with a property `p`, compute the two-point correlation function G(r) = ⟨(p(x) - ⟨p⟩)(p(x+r) - ⟨p⟩)⟩. A non-decaying or slowly decaying G(r) over long distances `r` indicates high Alignment. For dynamic systems, measure temporal coherence.

      justification: |
        In Landau theory, an order parameter is a quantity that is zero in a disordered phase and non-zero in an ordered (Aligned) phase. It directly quantifies the degree of macroscopic order emerging from microscopic correlations, making it a direct operational analog for the Aligned Pole's value. Examples include magnetization in a ferromagnet or the pair condensate wavefunction in a superconductor.

        S = -k_B Σ p_i ln(p_i)
      justification: |
        Alignment implies a reduction in the number of accessible microstates (Ω) for a given macrostate, as components are correlated. This directly corresponds to low statistical entropy (S = k_B ln Ω). While the Random Pole maps to high entropy and the Second Law, the Aligned Pole maps to states of high order and low entropy.

  adopted:
    - target: Order parameter (Ψ)
      rationale: It is the most general and directly measurable quantity in physics for describing the degree of emergent order (Alignment) in a system undergoing a phase transition from a Random to an Aligned state.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, 'Alignment' refers specifically to the internal coherence of a system's components along the Cohesion axis. This is distinct from its external agreement with a goal or another system (a concept more related to the Communion axis), though high internal Alignment is often a prerequisite for effective external action.
