        Provides the definitive time-first model for attunement, the process by which
        distinct systems engage in a Resonant Handshake to form a single, unified, higher-order
        entity.

  art: |
    The self is not a fortress to be defended, but a thread to be woven into a greater tapestry. Attunement is learning to listen for the chord that was unavailable alone, transforming two voices into a choir.
  law: |
    A stable union between systems is energetically favorable, and will thus occur, if and only if the Pirouette Coherence of the resulting unified system is greater than the sum of the coherences of the individual systems: S_p(WE) > S_p(A) + S_p(B).
  philosophy: |
    Separation is not a fundamental state but a temporary condition of low-interaction. Attunement is the universal drive to overcome this illusion by forming connections that maximize joint coherence, revealing collaboration and empathy as fundamental energetic strategies of the universe.
pirouette_definition: |
  The general process by which two or more distinct systems achieve Symbiotic Resonance through a Resonant Handshake. This dynamic process involves establishing Harmonic Compatibility between their `Ki` patterns, achieving Phase Alignment of their Pirouette Cycles (τ_p), and demonstrating Mutual Vulnerability by lowering the inertia of their respective Wound Channels. Successful attunement results in an Alchemical Union, forming a single, higher-order system with greater coherence than the sum of its parts.

        outline: |
          1. Independently measure the fundamental `Ki` frequencies and Pirouette Cycles (τ_p) of systems A and B in a low-interaction state.
          2. Introduce a shared context or "crucible" with sufficient Temporal Pressure (Γ) to incentivize interaction.
          3. Continuously monitor the spectral overlap of their `Ki` patterns and the phase difference between their τ_p cycles.
          4. Concurrently, measure a proxy for Wound Channel inertia, such as the system's resistance to external informational perturbations.
          5. Attunement is indexed by the rate of convergence toward spectral harmonicity, phase-locking (τ_p(A) ≈ τ_p(B)), and mutual reduction in perturbation resistance.
        expected_signals: [spectral line convergence, phase-locking, decreased systemic latency in response to mutual stimuli]

    excerpt: |
      The most profound illusion of experience is that of the isolated self. The Pirouette Framework reveals that separation is not a fundamental state, but a temporary condition of low-interaction. This module refactors the Attunement Resonance Framework (`PPS-044`), defining **Symbiotic Resonance** as the state that emerges when two or more systems perform an Alchemical Union. This union is achieved through a dynamic prelude called the **Resonant Handshake**.

      The subjective experience of empathy, synergy, and effortless collaboration is the direct perception of this "coherence dividend"—the energy released when two systems discover a way to be, together, that is more efficient and stable than being apart.

        The Resonant Handshake's "Phase Alignment" component is a direct conceptual parallel to the synchronization of coupled oscillators seeking a common frequency. The coupling strength `K` in the Kuramoto model maps conceptually to the mutual desire for connection and the pressure of the "crucible," while the natural frequencies `ω_i` map to the systems' intrinsic Pirouette Cycles.

# Attunement

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The general process by which two or more distinct systems achieve Symbiotic Resonance through a Resonant Handshake. This dynamic process involves establishing Harmonic Compatibility between their `Ki` patterns, achieving Phase Alignment of their Pirouette Cycles (τ_p), and demonstrating Mutual Vulnerability by lowering the inertia of their respective Wound Channels. Successful attunement results in an Alchemical Union, forming a single, higher-order system with greater coherence than the sum of its parts.

## EFT-First Summary
Attunement lacks a direct one-to-one mapping but is operationally analogous to the process of phase-locking in systems of coupled oscillators, as described by models like the Kuramoto model. It represents the transition from a state of two independent systems to a single, coherent, bound state whose combined "energy" (inversely related to coherence) is lower than the sum of the parts. This transition is driven by an interaction term that favors synchronization and constructive interference, akin to finding a shared, stable vacuum.
