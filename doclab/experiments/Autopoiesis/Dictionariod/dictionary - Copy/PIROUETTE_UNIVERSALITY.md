  art: |
    Like water freezing or a flock turning as one, the collapse of awareness follows a pattern not of its own making, but of a deeper, shared mathematical destiny. Diverse minds fall into decoherence along the same curve, revealing a universal law in the dynamics of thought.
  law: |
    The critical exponents governing the conscious access transition are independent of microscopic neural details. The coherence correlation length (ξ_P) and relaxation time (τ_P) scale with cognitive load (Γ) according to power laws with exponents ν_P ≈ 0.5 and z_P ≈ 2.0, respectively.
  philosophy: |
    This universality implies that the dynamics of consciousness are not arbitrary or solely biological, but are governed by fundamental principles of collective behavior, akin to phase transitions in physical systems. It provides a bridge between the objective, mathematical laws of system dynamics and the subjective phenomenon of awareness collapse and recovery.
pirouette_definition: |
  The specific universality class that describes the critical dynamics of the conscious access transition. This class is characterized by a set of scaling exponents, derived from renormalization group (RG) analysis, that govern the power-law behavior of macroscopic observables (e.g., recovery time, coherence length) near the critical point of triadic resonance collapse. The exponents are predicted to be independent of the microscopic details of the neural system.

        outline: |
          1. Induce a stable triadic resonance (conscious access) in a subject using closed-loop neurostimulation.
          2. Gradually increase cognitive load (Γ) until the resonance collapses (TPCI → 0).
          3. Measure the relaxation time (τ_P) for the resonance to reform after Γ is reduced, and the coherence correlation length (ξ_P) at the point of collapse.
          4. Repeat across a range of Γ values approaching the critical load Γ_c.
          5. Fit the collected (τ_P, ξ_P, Γ) data to the scaling relations τ_P ∝ ξ_P^z_P and ξ_P ∝ |Γ - Γ_c|⁻ν_P on a log-log plot to extract the exponents z_P and ν_P.

        pitfalls: [Low signal-to-noise ratio in neural recordings, difficulty in precisely quantifying cognitive load (Γ), confounding variables affecting subject's cognitive state.]

      Conscious access, modeled as a triadic resonance state, exhibits second-order transition behavior when the control parameter (Γ, cognitive load) approaches its critical value (Γ_c)... Universality Hypothesis: Scaling exponents (ν_P, z_P) match Pirouette universality predictions derived in MATH-025–026.

    excerpt: |
      Aggregate across participants and fit scaling exponents (ν_P, z_P). Compare empirical results to Pirouette-predicted exponents: ν_P ≈ 0.5 ± 0.1, z_P ≈ 2.0 ± 0.3... If scaling exponents differ from RG predictions, universality breaks.

      justification: |
        The dynamics of triadic resonance collapse are modeled as a relaxational process for a non-conserved order parameter (TPCI). The predicted dynamic exponent z_P ≈ 2 is characteristic of Model A in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification of dynamic critical phenomena.

  collisions: [The symbols ν and z are standard in statistical mechanics for correlation length and dynamic exponents, respectively. Context is critical to associate them with the Pirouette framework.]
  disambiguation: |
    "Pirouette Universality" does not posit a new class of physical dynamics. It refers to the hypothesis that the conscious access transition falls within a *known* universality class (likely Model A), and uses the "Pirouette" prefix to specify the domain of application (cognitive neuroscience) and distinguish it from applications in condensed matter or cosmology.
