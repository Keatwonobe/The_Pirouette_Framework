        **Resonant Depth (Kτ_well):** This replaces `Conceptual Mass`. It is a direct measure of a belief's temporal coherence—a function of its internal logical consistency, its explanatory power, and the sheer volume of its historical echoes. An idea reinforced by institutions, texts, and generations of minds possesses immense Resonant Depth, creating a stable, high-information pattern that resists erosion. It is the depth of the riverbed.

  art: |
    A belief's Resonant Depth is the riverbed carved by a song sung through generations. It is the accumulated echo of a truth, giving it the stability of history and the gravity of a well-worn path for consciousness to follow.
  law: |
    The Resonant Depth of a Coherence Well is proportional to the temporal integral of its self-reinforcing coherence signals. This accumulated potential dictates the energy required to alter a belief's trajectory, with deeper wells exhibiting greater inertia and entrainment force on the cognitive manifold.
  philosophy: |
    Resonant Depth replaces the static concept of a belief's 'mass' with a dynamic, historical one. It posits that the power of an idea lies not in its intrinsic, atemporal truth, but in its accumulated temporal reinforcement, making history itself the primary medium of cognitive structure and influence.
pirouette_definition: |
  Resonant Depth (Kτ_well) is the primary measure of a Coherence Well's temporal stability and influence, replacing the obsolete concept of 'Conceptual Mass'. It is a function of a belief system's internal logical consistency, its external explanatory power, and the integrated volume of its historical reinforcement through cultural artifacts (e.g., texts, institutions) and generational transmission. A high Kτ_well indicates a deep, stable pattern on the cognitive manifold that entrains thought by offering a high-coherence, low-energy state that represents a maximal solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian.

    procedures:
      - name: Diachronic Coherence Integration
        outline: |
          1. Identify the core tenets of the belief system (the resonant peak) within a large-scale cultural corpus (e.g., textual archives, social networks).
          2. Measure the rate of self-citation, institutional reinforcement, and memetic propagation over a significant historical period (diachronic analysis).
          3. Quantify the internal logical consistency and external explanatory power of the tenets.
          4. Integrate these signals over time. The resulting value represents the cumulative historical reinforcement, or Resonant Depth.
        expected_signals: [long-term persistence in texts, high citation network centrality, dedicated institutional support structures, high inter-subjective agreement on core concepts]
        pitfalls: [confusing short-term popularity with long-term depth, survivor bias in historical data, misidentifying the core resonant peak of the belief system]

    excerpt: |
      A Coherence Well is the geometric consequence of a thought that has achieved a critical mass of resonance... Its properties are temporal and dynamic, replacing the old spatial proxies: **Resonant Depth (Kτ_well):** This replaces `Conceptual Mass`. It is a direct measure of a belief's temporal coherence—a function of its internal logical consistency, its explanatory power, and the sheer volume of its historical echoes.
  - module: DOMA-120
    excerpt: |
      A Coherence Well is a region of the manifold that represents an optimal solution to this equation [the Pirouette Lagrangian]. It offers an exceptionally deep and stable potential well (a highly negative `V_Γ`), minimizing the "cost" of being. For those who align with its rhythm, it also provides a pre-packaged, high-coherence structure, boosting their internal `K_τ`.

formal_mappings:
  candidates:
    - target: Mass (m, M)
      domain: CM|GR
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Kτ_well explicitly replaces the concept of 'Conceptual Mass'. In classical mechanics and general relativity, mass is the source of gravity that warps spacetime. Analogously, Resonant Depth is the source of 'conceptual gravity' that carves the temporal landscape of the cognitive manifold.
      confidence: 0.7
  adopted:
    - target: Potential Well Depth (V_min)
      domain: EFT
      rationale: |
        This mapping is more precise than the mass analogy and is directly supported by the framework's Lagrangian formalism. A Coherence Well is defined as a deep potential well in the cognitive landscape, and its Resonant Depth corresponds to the depth of this potential. This depth determines the stability of the ground state (dogma) and the energy required for excitations (dissent).
      confidence: 0.85
constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "The rate of paradigm shift in a population is inversely proportional to the mean Resonant Depth of the dominant paradigm. Systems with higher Kτ_well will exhibit greater resistance to new, competing coherence wells."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observation of a society with a verifiably high Kτ_well paradigm (e.g., a deeply entrenched religious or political system with centuries of reinforcement) undergoing a rapid, low-energy paradigm shift without a correspondingly powerful new Coherence Well or high temporal pressure (Γ)."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [Kτ is the general symbol for coherence; the `_well` subscript specifies the integrated, historical coherence of a stable belief structure.]
  disambiguation: |
    Do not confuse Resonant Depth (Kτ_well) with an individual's or a transient idea's instantaneous coherence (Kτ). Kτ_well is an accumulated, historical property of a large-scale cognitive structure (a Coherence Well), whereas Kτ is a dynamic property of any resonant system. A mind can have high Kτ without being in a deep well.
