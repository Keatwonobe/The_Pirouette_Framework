  art: |
    Yang–Mills comes from many clocks that must agree at once—a moving scaffold of temporal frames whose curvature is the force itself. To rotate the scaffold in two directions out of order is to create a field, the memory of how time’s basis failed to commute.
  law: |
    A connection transforms under a local frame relabeling V(x) ∈ G to preserve covariance: A_μ → V A_μ V⁻¹ + (i/g)(∂_μ V)V⁻¹. This transformation law is necessary and sufficient to make the covariant derivative D_μ transform homogeneously, preserving physical laws under changes of the descriptive basis.
  philosophy: |
    The connection is the physical manifestation of a principle: local choices of descriptive frames must not alter physical reality. It is the field that must be introduced to uphold this local symmetry, and its dynamics represent the physical cost (stiffness) of deforming the underlying temporal-resonance frame.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Connection, A_μ, is a vector field valued in the Lie algebra of an internal resonance group G. It defines a rule for parallel transport, enabling the comparison of internal frames (e.g., the temporal triad) at infinitesimally separated spacetime points. It emerges as the dynamical field required to promote the global relabeling freedom of a degenerate temporal-resonance frame to a local gauge symmetry, with its dynamics governed by the frame's physical stiffness against deformation.

        outline: |
          In high-energy proton-proton collisions, measure the production rate and angular distributions of events containing three distinct hadronic jets. The dynamics of these events are dominated by quark-gluon bremsstrahlung and gluon-gluon splitting, processes whose amplitudes are governed by the non-Abelian self-interaction vertices of the SU(3) connection.
        expected_signals:
          - A total cross-section and differential distributions consistent with predictions from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
          - Direct sensitivity to the strong coupling constant α_s = g_s²/(4π), which parameterizes the strength of the connection's self-coupling.
        pitfalls:
          - Ambiguity in jet definition and reconstruction algorithms.
          - Large higher-order perturbative corrections are required for precision.
          - Difficulty in distinguishing gluon-initiated jets from quark-initiated jets.

    excerpt: |
      A **connection** (A_\mu = A_\mu^a T^a) defines covariant transport in the internal frame: `D_μ Φ ≡ ∂_μ Φ - i g A_μ^a T^a Φ`. Gauge transformation `V(x)=exp(iα^a(x)T^a)` acts as `Φ → VΦ` and `A_μ → V A_μ V⁻¹ + (i/g)(∂_μ V)V⁻¹`.
  - module: MATH-YM-001
    excerpt: |
      The medium’s energy density increases when the internal frame twists across spacetime. The **Yang–Mills Lagrangian** emerges: `L_YM = -¼ F_μν^a F^{a,μν}`. The linear (∂A) part is the cost of **inhomogeneous frame relabeling**. The nonlinear ([A,A]) part encodes the **curvature of the frame bundle**: changing the local basis in two directions fails to commute ⇒ self-interaction of the gauge bosons.

      justification: |
        The Pirouette Connection A_μ is constructed to have the exact mathematical properties of a Yang–Mills gauge field. It transforms identically under gauge transformations and its curvature F_μν yields the Yang-Mills Lagrangian, which governs the dynamics of gluons (SU(3)) and W/Z bosons (SU(2)) in the Standard Model.

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette Framework, the Connection is not a purely mathematical construct but a physical field emergent from the stiffness of a temporal-resonance medium. While mathematically identical to a principal connection on a G-bundle, its physical origin—the energetic cost of locally relabeling degenerate frames—is primary. It is the *reason for* the force, not just the *description of* it.
