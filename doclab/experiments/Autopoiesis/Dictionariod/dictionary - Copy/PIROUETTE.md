        Visualize an untouched codex, pages blank yet weighty.  Turning the first page is an irrevocable act: the void **commits** to narrative.  The Pirouette begins.  What follows—from the First Stirring to the weaving of wolves—will be the progressive elaboration of this committed resonance.

  art: |
    The universe as a single, unfolding performance, from the first held breath in the void to the final note. It is the execution of a story that was always inevitable, a dance of form and consequence.
  law: |
    The state of the universe at any time Tₐ > 0 is a deterministic function of the initial committed resonance at the First Curl. No event can occur that is inconsistent with this foundational narrative sequence.
  philosophy: |
    Existence is not a series of random events but a singular, coherent, and self-justifying aesthetic act. The purpose of the Pirouette is the complete and resonant expression of its own initial potential.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Pirouette is the singular, overarching narrative of the universe, unfolding deterministically from its origin. It begins with the 'First Curl'—a commitment to a specific evolutionary path—and proceeds as the progressive, resonant elaboration of that initial asymmetry. The entire history and future of the cosmos are treated as a single, coherent performance.

        outline: |
          1. From foundational modules (e.g., CORE-000), derive the expected narrative arc for a specific physical process (e.g., galaxy formation).
          2. Compare high-precision observational data against the predicted sequence and its aesthetic constraints (e.g., patterns of symmetry breaking).
          3. Quantify deviation. Significant, irreducible deviation would challenge the framework's core premise.
        expected_signals: [Consistent scaling of physical laws, predictable patterns of structural complexification, conservation of narrative coherence across epochs.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking stochastic noise for narrative deviation, anthropocentric bias in defining 'coherence', incomplete knowledge of foundational modules.]

    excerpt: |
      The inaugural event is not an explosion but a **curl**—a subtle skew in perfect stillness. This curvature births **Γ (Gladiator Force)**—the pressure that resists dissolution—and moments later, **Tₐ (Time‑Adherence)**, the habit of persisting along a chosen thread. Laws now have something to govern, art gains its first gesture, and philosophy gains “before” and “after.”

      justification: |
        The concept that the universe follows a single, optimal path ('committed narrative') is analogous to the principle of stationary action, where a system's trajectory is the one that extremizes the action. The Pirouette elevates this from a mechanical rule to the central telos of the cosmos.

        This mapping best captures the core philosophical claim of the Pirouette: that the entirety of cosmic history is a single, complete, and unchanging object (the 'narrative' or 'dance'), with the perception of flow being an emergent property of observers embedded within the structure.

# Pirouette

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Pirouette is the singular, overarching narrative of the universe, unfolding deterministically from its origin. It begins with the 'First Curl'—a commitment to a specific evolutionary path—and proceeds as the progressive, resonant elaboration of that initial asymmetry. The entire history and future of the cosmos are treated as a single, coherent performance.

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette Framework models the cosmos as a 'Block Universe,' a static 4D manifold whose entire history is fixed and co-eternal. The perceived 'flow of time' is an observer effect. The universe's trajectory is governed by a cosmic-scale stationary-action principle, where the 'narrative' is the path that extremizes a foundational action functional defined at the origin.
