    It is the vital signs chart for a river of information. The profile plots the deep, steady rhythm of the current against the chaotic spray of the surface, revealing the river's true health and power.
  law: |
    A Coherence Profile is a time-ordered sequence of (Kτ, Γ) pairs, where Kτ quantifies a data segment's internal pattern resonance and Γ quantifies its internal unpredictability. The profile is the necessary output of applying the Rhythmic Sieve protocol to an information stream.
  philosophy: |
    By transforming a raw, one-dimensional stream into a two-dimensional profile of coherence versus dissonance, the profile reveals the underlying dynamic state (e.g., laminar, turbulent) and Lagrangian efficiency of an information process, making its health and character directly observable.

  The primary output of the Rhythmic Sieve (`DOMA-181`), consisting of a time-series of paired Coherence (Kτ) and Dissonance (Γ) values. Calculated over discrete temporal windows of an information stream, the profile serves as an empirical map of the system's dynamic state and provides a direct measurement proxy for the "kinetic" (Kτ) and "potential" (Γ) terms of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`).

        outline: |
          1. Segment a continuous information stream into discrete temporal windows (fixed or adaptive).
          2. For each window, compute Coherence (Kτ) via methods like autocorrelation or Fourier analysis, and Dissonance (Γ) via methods like Shannon entropy.
          3. Record the sequence of (Kτ, Γ) pairs, ordered by time, to form the profile.
        expected_signals: [Laminar flow: high, stable Kτ and low Γ. Turbulent flow: low Kτ and high, volatile Γ. Stagnant flow: low Kτ and low Γ.]
        pitfalls: [Incorrect window size can alias or miss phenomena (scale mismatch). Choice of Kτ/Γ estimators can introduce bias or be computationally expensive.]

      For each temporal window, we calculate a pair of fundamental metrics that form the stream's primary **Coherence Profile**. ... The primary output of this stage is a time-series of `(Kτ, Γ)` pairs, a rich representation of the stream's dynamic health.

    excerpt: |
      By plotting the Coherence Profile, a Weaver creates an empirical map of the system's path through its own coherence manifold. The derived **Coherence Ratio (CR)** serves as a proxy for the *efficiency* with which the system is maximizing its Lagrangian at that moment.

      justification: |
        A spectrogram plots the power of frequency components over time. The Coherence Profile simplifies this by collapsing the frequency dimension into a single 'Coherence' (Kτ) metric (e.g., power of dominant frequency) and pairs it with a 'Dissonance' (Γ) metric (e.g., broadband noise floor or entropy), providing a similar but lower-dimensional diagnostic of a signal's changing character.

    The Coherence Profile is the time-series output itself, not the process that creates it (the Rhythmic Sieve) nor the derived single-value diagnostic (the Coherence Ratio). It is the complete `(Kτ, Γ)` vs. time dataset.

# Coherence Profile

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The primary output of the Rhythmic Sieve (`DOMA-181`), consisting of a time-series of paired Coherence (Kτ) and Dissonance (Γ) values. Calculated over discrete temporal windows of an information stream, the profile serves as an empirical map of the system's dynamic state and provides a direct measurement proxy for the "kinetic" (Kτ) and "potential" (Γ) terms of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`).

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, a Coherence Profile is analogous to a simplified spectrogram, tracking a signal's primary carrier strength (Coherence, Kτ) against its broadband noise floor (Dissonance, Γ) over time. It provides a two-dimensional diagnostic of a signal's evolving quality and structure, serving as a time-domain plot of signal versus noise.
