    Health as a conserved current, a river that neither leaks nor stagnates. The Lens Equation is the calculus of a system's lifeblood, mapping its channels and tides to reveal where the flow is broken.
  law: |
    In a healthy, steady-state system, the net flux of coherent potential across any closed boundary must be zero, and its local density must be constant in time. Any non-zero value of Φ signifies a source or sink of coherence, which is the mathematical definition of pathology.
  philosophy: |
    This equation elevates diagnostics from qualitative description to quantitative science. By treating coherence as a conserved quantity, it provides a universal conservation law for systemic health, making pathology a measurable, geometric property of a system's information flow.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Lens Equation, Φ, is a fundamental conservation law within the Pirouette Framework that describes the balance of coherent potential in a system. It states that in a healthy system, the divergence of the coherence flux (∇·(μ Ki⃗)) must be balanced by the rate of change of coherence density (∂(ρc²)/∂t), ensuring no net loss or pathological accumulation of potential. A non-zero Φ indicates a pathological state, such as energy leakage (∇·Ki⃗ > 0), a coherence bottleneck (∂ρ/∂t < 0), or systemic over-constraint (μ → ∞).

# Lens Equation

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Lens Equation, Φ, is a fundamental conservation law within the Pirouette Framework that describes the balance of coherent potential in a system. It states that in a healthy system, the divergence of the coherence flux (∇·(μ Ki⃗)) must be balanced by the rate of change of coherence density (∂(ρc²)/∂t), ensuring no net loss or pathological accumulation of potential. A non-zero Φ indicates a pathological state, such as energy leakage (∇·Ki⃗ > 0), a coherence bottleneck (∂ρ/∂t < 0), or systemic over-constraint (μ → ∞).

## EFT-First Summary
The Lens Equation is mathematically a form of the continuity equation, `∂ρ/∂t + ∇·J = σ`, which expresses a local conservation law. In this mapping, the coherence density (`ρ`) and coherence flux (`J = -μKi⃗`) are balanced against a source/sink term `σ`. The Pirouette term `Φ` is directly proportional to this source term, quantifying the local rate at which coherence is being pathologically generated or destroyed, thus breaking perfect conservation.
