    A silent, pervasive hum in the fabric of time, whose steady tone gives all things their weight and substance. It is the equilibrium tension of the temporal substrate, the ground note against which all particle dynamics are played.
  law: |
    All fundamental particle rest masses are directly proportional to Γ₀. A uniform 1% variation in Γ₀, induced by external conditions, would produce a correlated 1% shift in the measured masses of all gauge bosons, fermions, and the Higgs-like scalar.
  philosophy: |
    Γ₀ reframes mass not as an intrinsic property of particles or a gift from an external field, but as a measure of a particle's interaction with the temporal substrate's inherent stiffness. It replaces the ad-hoc Higgs mechanism with a geometric property of the background, unifying inertia with the very flow of time.

  The **Vacuum Expectation Value of Γ**, denoted **Γ₀**, is the non-zero, spatially uniform equilibrium value of the scalar Γ-field that minimizes the substrate potential `V(Γ)`. It functions as the fundamental order parameter for mass generation, setting the scale for all coupled particles, including the Higgs-like scalar `H`, vector bosons `A_μ`, and fermions `Ψ`, through the relations `m_H ∝ √λ_Γ Γ₀`, `m_A ∝ g_N Γ₀`, and `m_f = y_Γ Γ₀` respectively.

        outline: |
          Γ₀ is not measured directly but is inferred from a global fit to observed particle masses. Using the precisely measured masses of the W boson (`m_W`) and the Higgs-like scalar (`m_H`), along with their respective couplings `g_W` and `λ_Γ`, one can solve the system of equations `m_W = g_W √ξ Γ₀` and `m_H = 2√λ_Γ √ξ Γ₀` to determine a value for Γ₀. This value is then cross-checked for consistency with fermion masses.

        In the Standard Model, the Higgs VEV `v_h` sets the electroweak mass scale. The composite VEV `v = √ξ Γ₀` plays the identical operational role, generating gauge boson and fermion masses in direct analogy. However, `Γ₀` originates from the temporal substrate, not from the potential of a fundamental scalar field.

# Vacuum Expectation Value of Γ

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The **Vacuum Expectation Value of Γ**, denoted **Γ₀**, is the non-zero, spatially uniform equilibrium value of the scalar Γ-field that minimizes the substrate potential `V(Γ)`. It functions as the fundamental order parameter for mass generation, setting the scale for all coupled particles, including the Higgs-like scalar `H`, vector bosons `A_μ`, and fermions `Ψ`, through the relations `m_H ∝ √λ_Γ Γ₀`, `m_A ∝ g_N Γ₀`, and `m_f = y_Γ Γ₀` respectively.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, Γ₀ sets the mass scale for the Pirouette Framework in the same way the Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV) `v ≈ 246 GeV` sets the electroweak scale in the Standard Model. All particle masses are proportional to Γ₀, with the specific values determined by gauge (`g_N`), scalar (`λ_Γ`), and torsion (`y_Γ`) couplings. Unlike the Higgs VEV, Γ₀ is not a fundamental parameter but emerges from the 'temporal elasticity' of the background substrate.
