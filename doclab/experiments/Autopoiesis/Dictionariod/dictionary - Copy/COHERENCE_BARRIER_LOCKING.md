    The Higgs potential is not a static landscape but the result of a resonance. Temporal pressure softens the taut string of frame alignment until it sags, and the depth of that sag—the electroweak scale—is the locked-in frequency of the system's fundamental note.
  law: |
    The Higgs vacuum expectation value `v` is not a fundamental constant but is dynamically set by the balance between positive bare curvature from frame stiffness (`α₀ ∝ (g² + g'²)ω_c²`) and negative curvature from temporal-pressure softening (`-λ_HΓ<Γ²>`). The relation `v² = (-α₀ + λ_HΓ<Γ²>) / β` fixes the electroweak scale as a derived quantity.
  philosophy: |
    This mechanism removes the arbitrariness of the electroweak scale, promoting it from an input parameter to a predictable consequence of deeper dynamics. It embodies the principle that fundamental scales should be emergent properties of a system's structure and resonances, not simply measured constants.
pirouette_definition: |
  A resonance mechanism that sets the absolute energy scale of the Higgs potential. It operates by balancing two competing effects: (1) the positive quadratic term (`α₀|H|²`) arising from the bare stiffness of the SU(2)L triad and U(1)Y clock frames, scaled by the coherence barrier frequency `ω_c`, and (2) a negative quadratic contribution (`-λ_HΓ<Γ²>|H|²`) from the softening effect of temporal pressure (`Γ`). This dynamic equilibrium "locks" the Higgs vacuum expectation value `v` to the properties of the `Γ` field and the gauge frame stiffnesses, thereby deriving the electroweak scale.

        Coherence-barrier Locking provides a dynamical origin for the ad-hoc negative mass-squared parameter `μ²` of the Standard Model Higgs potential. It derives the negative sign and magnitude from the physical competition between positive frame stiffness (`α₀`) and negative softening from the temporal pressure field (`-λ_HΓ<Γ²>`), thus explaining electroweak symmetry breaking.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike dimensional transmutation (e.g., in QCD) which generates a scale purely from quantum loop effects (running couplings), Coherence-barrier Locking is a semi-classical mechanism. It is a tree-level balancing of potentials, where the scale `ω_c` is set by a separate resonance condition, not by the running of a coupling to infinity.

# Coherence-barrier Locking

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Coherence-barrier Locking is a resonance mechanism that sets the absolute energy scale of the Higgs potential. It operates by balancing two competing effects: (1) the positive quadratic term (`α₀|H|²`) arising from the bare stiffness of the SU(2)L triad and U(1)Y clock frames, scaled by the coherence barrier frequency `ω_c`, and (2) a negative quadratic contribution (`-λ_HΓ<Γ²>|H|²`) from the softening effect of temporal pressure (`Γ`). This dynamic equilibrium "locks" the Higgs vacuum expectation value `v` to the properties of the `Γ` field and the gauge frame stiffnesses, thereby deriving the electroweak scale.

## EFT-First Summary
This mechanism provides a dynamical origin for the Higgs potential's negative mass-squared term (`μ²`) in the Standard Model. Instead of being a fundamental input, `μ²` is identified with an effective parameter `α(Γ) = α₀ - λ_HΓ<Γ²>`, where `α₀ > 0` represents a bare "stiffness" and the negative term arises from coupling to a background field. This makes the Higgs vev `v = sqrt(-μ²/λ)` a derived quantity dependent on the background and other couplings, leading to testable correlations between the Higgs self-coupling, `v`, and the weak mixing angle.
