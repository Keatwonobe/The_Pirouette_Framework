        **Tension (Interactions):** What we perceive as forces are the geometric relationships between these knots. They are the tensions, slopes, and curvatures in the fabric of the Loom, arising from the presence of the knots themselves.

    A force is not a push or a pull from a distant object, but the feeling of the shortest path being a curve. It is the tug of a thread in a universal tapestry, a local strain in the fabric of spacetime telling you which way to fall.
  law: |
    The acceleration of a system is proportional to the local gradient of the coherence field. Tension is this gradient, a geometric feature of the Coherence Manifold that directs systems along geodesics of maximal coherence.
  philosophy: |
    Tension replaces the concept of fundamental forces with a unified, emergent principle of geometry. It asserts that all interactions are one phenomenon—the shape of the spacetime manifold—thereby dissolving the distinction between the stage and the actors.
pirouette_definition: |
  The emergent perception of force, arising from the geometry of the Coherence Manifold. Tension is the set of local curvatures, gradients, and shears in the manifold created by the presence of stable resonant systems (Knots). A system moving through the manifold experiences Tension as an imperative to follow a geodesic of maximal coherence, which manifests as acceleration or a change in state. It is the physical expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence acting on a system's trajectory.

          1. Introduce a low-coherence probe system (a test Knot) into the vicinity of a source Knot.
          2. Map the probe's trajectory (its world-line) with high precision.
          3. Compute the probe's four-acceleration, its deviation from the baseline geodesic of an unperturbed (flat) manifold region.
          4. The measured acceleration field is directly proportional to the Tension field (Σ_p) generated by the source Knot.

    excerpt: |
      Electromagnetism Is The Geometry of Interaction (`CORE-007`): This force emerges from asymmetries in how a system's resonance interacts with its environment. The Electric Field is the **gradient** of the manifold; the Magnetic Field is the **curl** or rotational shear created by a moving asymmetry. Attraction and repulsion are the simple act of "coherence surfing" along these geometric features.

      justification: |
        In General Relativity, the Christoffel symbols in the geodesic equation represent the "fictitious" forces (like gravity) that arise from the curvature of spacetime. This maps directly to Pirouette's concept of Tension as a geometric feature of the manifold that dictates acceleration. Tension is the generalized physical effect whose components would be the Christoffel symbols.

      justification: |
        In gauge theory, forces arise from the curvature of a connection on a fiber bundle. The field strength tensor (e.g., for electromagnetism) represents this curvature. Pirouette's Tension subsumes this concept, proposing that the relevant geometry is not in an abstract internal space but in the Coherence Manifold itself, with different forces corresponding to different geometric properties (gradient, curl, etc.).

  adopted:
    - target: Christoffel Symbols (Γ^λ_μν)
      rationale: The Christoffel symbols provide the most direct and operational mathematical analog for how a geometric property of a manifold (spacetime) dictates the acceleration of objects (force). This aligns perfectly with Tension's role in the geodesic of maximal coherence.

    Pirouette Tension (Σ_p) is a fundamental concept describing *all* interactions as geometry, not to be confused with the tension in a physical object like a string from String Theory or classical mechanics. While the metaphor of a "taut fabric" is useful, Pirouette Tension encompasses all geometric features (slopes, twists, compressions) that influence a system's path.

# Tension

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The emergent perception of force, arising from the geometry of the Coherence Manifold. Tension is the set of local curvatures, gradients, and shears in the manifold created by the presence of stable resonant systems (Knots). A system moving through the manifold experiences Tension as an imperative to follow a geodesic of maximal coherence, which manifests as acceleration or a change in state. It is the physical expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence acting on a system's trajectory.

## EFT-First Summary
Tension is the Pirouette Framework's unification of all fundamental forces, analogous to the role of spacetime curvature in General Relativity. Where GR models gravity as geometry, Pirouette extends this principle: all forces, including those of the Standard Model, are manifestations of the Coherence Manifold's geometry (its local gradients, curls, and non-linear stress-energy feedback). It is operationally mapped to the Christoffel symbols (`Γ^λ_μν`) as the components of a generalized 'force' that deflects a system from an inertial path.
