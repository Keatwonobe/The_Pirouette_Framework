  art: |
    The open hand reaching for another. The tendency of separate threads to weave a tapestry, where the strength of the whole exceeds the sum of its parts. It is the verb of connection.
  law: |
    A system's Transactional tendency is proportional to its rate of forming stable, information-sharing bonds with external systems, and inversely proportional to its mean interaction-rejection cross-section.
  philosophy: |
    The Transactional Pole represents the universe's inherent bias towards complexity and connection, as described by the Time Attractor. It is the grammar's verb for 'becoming more,' positing that altruism and symbiosis are not evolutionary accidents but fundamental, favored strategies for persistence and emergence.
pirouette_definition: |
  The positive pole of the Communion axis within the Behavioral Triad, describing a system's tendency to engage in exchange, form bonds, and resonate with other systems. A high Transactional state is characterized by the formation of larger, more complex composite systems, and is manifested in phenomena ranging from chemical bonding to altruistic social behavior.

          For a population of systems, map the interaction network over time. Quantify the rate of new, stable bond formation (edges) versus the rate of rejected interaction attempts or destructive interactions. The Transactional value (χ) is a normalized function of (successful bonds / total interactions).

    excerpt: |
      Altruism... is a state of being at the highest pole of the Communion axis. It is the most effective strategy for creating complex, resilient, and lasting patterns in the universe... The Traveler's passage disrupts time in a way that favors the formation of systems that are highly Inward, highly Aligned, and, above all, highly Transactional. This is the "time attractor."

        χ ∝ ΔI(X;Y) / Δt
      justification: |
        Mutual information quantifies the statistical dependence between two systems (X and Y). An increase in I(X;Y) following an interaction is a direct measure of new correlation or 'bonding.' The Transactional tendency can be modeled as the rate at which a system increases mutual information with its environment.

        Interaction terms in a Lagrangian explicitly define how different fields (systems) couple and exchange quanta. The coupling constant `g` can be seen as a proxy for the intrinsic strength of the Transactional tendency between the fields, determining the probability of a bonding interaction.

    Distinct from the Vector Pole 'Inward' (absorption). Transactional implies a mutual, often symmetric exchange or bonding, whereas Inward describes a one-way flow of convergence. A black hole is maximally Inward but also highly Isolated, not Transactional.

# Transactional Pole

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The positive pole of the Communion axis within the Behavioral Triad, describing a system's tendency to engage in exchange, form bonds, and resonate with other systems. A high Transactional state is characterized by the formation of larger, more complex composite systems, and is manifested in phenomena ranging from chemical bonding to altruistic social behavior.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Transactional Pole can be mapped to the change in Mutual Information `ΔI(X;Y)` between two interacting systems. A high Transactional tendency corresponds to interactions that maximize this value, creating new, stable correlations and information-sharing bonds. This contrasts with purely scattering events that leave systems uncorrelated, which would represent a more Isolated dynamic. Conceptually, this mirrors the function of a coupling constant in a field theory Lagrangian, which sets the fundamental strength of interaction between fields.
