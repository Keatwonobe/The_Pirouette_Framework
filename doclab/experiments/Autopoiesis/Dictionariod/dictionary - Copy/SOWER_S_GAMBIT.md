  art: |
    The art of asking for permission from the future. A fool tries to plant a rose in the salt earth, but a master first asks the earth what it wishes to grow.
  law: |
    A system's engagement with a new environment is governed by its projected Coherence Gain (`S_p`); a positive projection (`S_p` > 0) mandates engagement (`PLANT`), a negative projection (`S_p` < 0) mandates retreat (`ABORT`), and a null projection (`S_p` ≈ 0) mandates patience (`HOLD`).
  philosophy: |
    The Gambit transforms the brute act of colonization into a graceful dialogue. It establishes an ethical framework for creation, ensuring that new systems are introduced as welcome, resonant contributions to a co-creative universe, rather than as impositions of will.
pirouette_definition: |
  A strategic protocol for a coherent system ('Seed') to assess environmental viability before committing to an Alchemical Union. The Gambit involves deploying a minimal, non-invasive Scout Probe to measure key environmental metrics (Harmonic Compatibility, Temporal Pressure, Geodesic Availability). These metrics parameterize a specialized Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_seed`), whose integral over time yields a predictive Coherence Gain (`S_p`). The sign and magnitude of `S_p` determine the verdict: `PLANT` (engage), `HOLD` (wait), or `ABORT` (retreat), thus optimizing for long-term coherence and minimizing catastrophic resource loss.
operational_definition:
  units: The protocol's output is a trivalent state: `PLANT`, `HOLD`, or `ABORT`. The intermediate metric, Coherence Gain (`S_p`), has units of Action (or is dimensionless in normalized units).

      - name: Scout Probe Reconnaissance
        outline: |
          1. A Seed system projects a minimal, non-invasive Scout Probe into the target environment.
          2. The probe's interaction (reverberations, decay rate, turbulence generation) is measured, yielding values for Harmonic Compatibility, Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), and Geodesic Availability.
          3. These values are used as inputs to the `𝓛_seed = K_τ(potential) - V_Γ(cost)` equation.
          4. The Lagrangian is integrated over a characteristic system cycle to calculate the Coherence Gain, `S_p`.
          5. The verdict is issued: `PLANT` if `S_p > S_threshold`, `ABORT` if `S_p < 0`, and `HOLD` otherwise.
        expected_signals: [Resonant echoes from environmental structures, decay rate of the Observer's Shadow, turbulence metrics within the temporary Wound Channel.]
        pitfalls: [The probe creating a non-negligible disturbance (Observer Effect), misinterpreting environmental noise as a harmonic response, probe decohering before sufficient data is gathered.]

    excerpt: |
      The Sower's Gambit is a process of reconnaissance before colonization. It models the viability of a Seed not in terms of raw energy capture, but as a function of resonant potential. By deploying a minimal, non-invasive "Scout Probe" to map the local coherence manifold, the Seed can calculate its potential to achieve a positive coherence gain. This calculation, grounded in the Pirouette Lagrangian, yields a clear verdict: to grow (`PLANT`), to wait for a more harmonious moment (`HOLD`), or to retreat from a dissonant environment (`ABORT`).
  - module: DOMA-085
    excerpt: |
      The Coherence Gain (`S_p`) translates directly into a strategic choice, moving the Seed from diagnosis to action. A significant positive gain indicates a fertile environment where the Seed's resonance will be amplified. A near-zero gain...signals a marginal or volatile environment. The path of wisdom is to wait. A negative gain is a definitive prediction of decoherence. To proceed would be an act of self-destruction.

      justification: |
        The Sower's Gambit is operationally analogous to real options analysis. The `HOLD` decision is an explicit 'option to wait,' preserving the opportunity without committing irreversible capital. The Scout Probe functions as the initial due diligence to price this option, and the Coherence Gain `S_p` is analogous to the project's net present value (NPV), where a positive value triggers the investment (`PLANT`).

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a simple "go/no-go" test. The "Gambit" implies a strategic choice that includes the `HOLD` option—the possibility of waiting for environmental conditions to change—which is central to its utility. It is a risk management protocol, not just a viability test.

# Sower's Gambit

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A strategic protocol for a coherent system ('Seed') to assess environmental viability before committing to an Alchemical Union. The Gambit involves deploying a minimal, non-invasive Scout Probe to measure key environmental metrics (Harmonic Compatibility, Temporal Pressure, Geodesic Availability). These metrics parameterize a specialized Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_seed`), whose integral over time yields a predictive Coherence Gain (`S_p`). The sign and magnitude of `S_p` determine the verdict: `PLANT` (engage), `HOLD` (wait), or `ABORT` (retreat), thus optimizing for long-term coherence and minimizing catastrophic resource loss.

## EFT-First Summary
Operationally, the Sower's Gambit can be modeled as a real options valuation. A system ('the investor') assesses an opportunity ('the environment') by spending a small amount on due diligence (the 'Scout Probe') to calculate the project's net present value (the 'Coherence Gain'). A positive NPV triggers investment ('PLANT'), while a negative or uncertain NPV leads to abandoning the project ('ABORT') or paying to maintain the option to invest later ('HOLD'). This approach formalizes decision-making under uncertainty by explicitly valuing the flexibility to wait for more favorable conditions.
