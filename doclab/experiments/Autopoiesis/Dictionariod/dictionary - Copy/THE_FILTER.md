    A cell membrane letting in nutrients while repelling toxins. A well-tended garden gate that welcomes friends but turns away trespassers. A conversation that is open to new ideas without losing its point.
  law: |
    A Coherence Boundary's permeability is a direct, measurable function of its projected Ki pattern's resonant harmonics; only external patterns that form a Resonant Handshake with these specific harmonics can traverse the boundary. All others are reflected.
  philosophy: |
    To thrive is not to isolate but to selectively engage. The Filter demonstrates that true resilience lies in a dynamic balance between integrity and openness, allowing a system to learn from its environment without being destroyed by it.

  A Filter is a type of Coherence Boundary characterized by high integrity and selective permeability. Its projected Ki pattern contains specific "resonant windows"—discrete harmonic frequencies—that allow compatible information and energy to pass through the Temporal Pressure (Γ) gradient while reflecting dissonant or chaotic influences.

    excerpt: |
      **Permeability (Resonant Coupling):** A boundary is not a passive filter but an active resonator. Its permeability is a function of its geometry of resonance... An external influence can cross the boundary only if its own Ki pattern can perform a "Resonant Handshake" with the boundary's Ki. This is selective permeability in its most fundamental form: the membrane listens to every knock, but the door only opens for those who know the password, which is a harmonic of its own song.

        A band-pass filter allows signals within a specific frequency range (the "passband") to go through while attenuating signals outside that range. This is a direct operational analogue to The Filter's "resonant windows" for specific Ki patterns (harmonics/frequencies), which selectively permit transmission. The Filter is a collection of potentially non-contiguous band-pass filters.

    "The Filter" is a noun describing a specific type of Coherence Boundary, defined by its function of selective permeability. It should be distinguished from the verb "filtering" (the general process of separation) and its counterparts on the containment spectrum: "The Fortress" (near-total rejection) and "The Lens" (active transformation of throughput).

# The Filter

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Filter is a type of Coherence Boundary characterized by high integrity and selective permeability. Its projected Ki pattern contains specific "resonant windows"—discrete harmonic frequencies—that allow compatible information and energy to pass through the Temporal Pressure (Γ) gradient while reflecting dissonant or chaotic influences. This strategy balances protection with the necessary exchange for growth and sustenance, and is the archetypal boundary strategy of living systems.

## Formal Summary
Operationally, The Filter functions as a set of sophisticated **band-pass filters**, a concept from signal processing. Just as an electronic filter allows only specific frequencies of a signal to pass, The Filter's resonant windows allow only specific Ki patterns (harmonics) from the environment to traverse the boundary. Its behavior can be mapped by measuring its transmission spectrum (`Π_ω`), which reveals sharp peaks at allowed frequencies and deep troughs at rejected ones.
