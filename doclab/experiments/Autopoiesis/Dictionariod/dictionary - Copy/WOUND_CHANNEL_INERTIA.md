      snippet: |
        Persistence in a mode carves a **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) into the manifold, geometrically deepening its basin over time. This increases the `Stability Depth`, making the state a "habit" that is gravitationally harder to leave. It is the memory of the state.

  art: |
    A river's memory, etched in stone. The more a path is walked, the deeper it becomes, until gravity itself guides the next footstep. This is the inertia of habit.
  law: |
    The stability depth of a modal basin increases as a function of the cumulative time integral of coherence within that basin. A system's history is physically inscribed onto its state landscape, creating a path-dependent resistance to change. `d(Œîùìõ_p)/dt_p ‚àù ùìõ_p,m`.
  philosophy: |
    This mechanism grounds history and memory in the geometry of the system's dynamics. It asserts that what a system *has done* directly alters what it *can do* next. It is the physical basis for habit, practice, and entrenchment, turning transient states into enduring features of the landscape.
pirouette_definition: |
  A measure of a modal basin's historically-acquired resistance to change, distinct from its instantaneous stability. It is the geometric deepening of a basin on the Coherence Manifold, caused by the carving of a Wound Channel (CORE-011) through persistent occupation of the corresponding mode. This process increases the mode's Stability Depth (Œîùìõ_p), making it a more entrenched, "habitual" state that requires a larger perturbation to exit.
operational_definition:
  units: Units of Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p), often dimensionless "Coherence".

        outline: |
          1. Identify a stable system mode (`Ki_m`).
          2. Hold the system in this mode for a duration `t_p`.
          3. Apply a calibrated dissonant injection (a perturbation) with incrementally increasing amplitude until a phase leap to a different mode is induced.
          4. The minimum perturbation amplitude required to cause the leap is a proxy for the current Stability Depth, `Œîùìõ_p(t_p)`.
          5. Repeat for various `t_p` values while holding external Temporal Pressure (Œì) constant.
          6. The increase in `Œîùìõ_p` as a function of `t_p` quantifies the accumulation of `I_wc`.

        pitfalls: [Failure to hold external Œì constant, misidentifying phase leaps, system noise obscuring the threshold]

    excerpt: |
      **Wound Channel Inertia**: Persistence in a mode carves a **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) into the manifold, geometrically deepening its basin over time. This increases the `Stability Depth`, making the state a "habit" that is gravitationally harder to leave. It is the memory of the state.
  - module: DOMA-185
    excerpt: |
      For each mode, measure its resistance to perturbation to determine its `Stability Depth (Œîùìõ_p)`. Analyze its persistence over time to estimate the contribution of its `Wound Channel Inertia`. This reveals how "sticky" or habitual each state is.

      justification: |
        Hebbian learning posits that repeated, persistent activation of a neural pathway strengthens its synaptic connections. This is a direct analog to Wound Channel Inertia, where persistent occupation of a modal basin (equivalent to a stable pattern of neural activity) strengthens its stability (equivalent to synaptic weights), making that pattern more likely to recur and harder to disrupt.

      domain: Materials Science
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        In work hardening, plastic deformation of a metal increases its resistance to further deformation. Similarly, the "work" of maintaining a coherent mode for a period of time hardens the system's state against perturbations that would deform it into a new state. Both are forms of path-dependent resistance acquired through the system's history.

  disambiguation: |
    Wound Channel Inertia is not the physical inertia (mass) of a system's components. It is an emergent property of the system's *state* on the Coherence Manifold, representing a resistance to a *change in mode*, not a resistance to a change in motion. The "inertia" is one of habit or configuration.
