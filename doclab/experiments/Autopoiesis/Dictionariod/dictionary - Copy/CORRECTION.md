    A faint echo in the lepton's spin, a whisper from the temporal substrate that grows louder with mass. It is the signature of wound time, a torsion that differentiates one generation from the next.
  law: |
    The Pirouette framework predicts a non-Standard-Model correction to the anomalous magnetic moment of charged leptons (ℓ=e,μ,τ) that scales with the square of the lepton's mass relative to the electron mass, Δa_ℓ^(Γ) ∝ (m_ℓ/m_e)².
  philosophy: |
    The Γ-Correction serves as a primary, falsifiable bridge between the abstract Γ-sector dynamics and high-precision particle physics. Its existence would validate that mass is not merely a parameter but an active charge coupling to the temporal substrate, with tangible consequences for electroweak observables.
pirouette_definition: |
  A predicted contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of a charged lepton (ℓ), Δa_ℓ^(Γ), arising from the coupling of the lepton's worldline to the Γ-field (temporal pressure). It is proportional to (α/π)³ and scales with lepton mass (m_ℓ) to the power p=1+2Δ, where Δ is the scaling dimension of wound-channel torsion. With Δ≈0.5, the correction scales quadratically with mass, providing a distinct, testable signature of Γ-sector physics across lepton generations.

        The Γ-Correction is a specific, motivated candidate for a Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) contribution to the lepton anomalous magnetic moment. Its unique mass-scaling signature (∝ m_ℓ²) distinguishes it from many other BSM scenarios, such as those involving new light bosons or generic Wilson coefficients in an EFT framework.

# Γ-Correction

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A predicted contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of a charged lepton (ℓ), Δa_ℓ^(Γ), arising from the coupling of the lepton's worldline to the Γ-field (temporal pressure). It is proportional to (α/π)³ and scales with lepton mass (m_ℓ) to the power p=1+2Δ, where Δ is the scaling dimension of wound-channel torsion. With Δ≈0.5, the correction scales quadratically with mass, providing a distinct, testable signature of Γ-sector physics across lepton generations.

## EFT-First Summary
The Γ-Correction is a predicted Beyond-Standard-Model contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of charged leptons, Δa_ℓ. It is proposed to resolve the standing muon g-2 anomaly and provides a sharp prediction for the tau g-2. The correction scales quadratically with lepton mass (∝ m_ℓ²), a distinctive signature testable against other New Physics models in the lepton sector.
