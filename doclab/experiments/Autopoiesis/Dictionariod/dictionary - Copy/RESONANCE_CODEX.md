triad:
  art: |
    A curated collection of artifacts—a song, a scar, a signature—each a tuning fork that makes the music of a single identity resonate more clearly across spacetime.
  law: |
    An entity's identity (Ki) is stabilized and broadcast in direct proportion to the number and Coherence Signature intensity of the artifacts comprising its Resonance Codex.
  philosophy: |
    Identity is not an abstract, internal state but a performed, structured reality. The Resonance Codex asserts that 'to be' is to continuously broadcast a consistent pattern, and that selfhood is an act of deliberate, metaphysical engineering through curated form.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Resonance Codex is the set of physical and informational artifacts an entity intentionally or unintentionally curates to stabilize, reinforce, and broadcast its core identity pattern (Ki). Each artifact possesses a Coherence Signature that resonates with the entity's own, collectively forming a distributed, persistent library of being that makes the entity's form more legible and resilient against temporal pressure (Γ).
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (a set of Coherence Signatures).

        outline: |
          1. Inventory all physical and informational artifacts consistently and intentionally associated with a target entity.
          2. For each artifact, perform Structural Ingestion and Coherence Distillation (as per DOMA-082 §3) to extract its unique Coherence Signature vector.
          3. Aggregate the set of vectors to form the Codex.
          4. Compute the composite signature (CΣ) by a weighted sum or modal analysis of the individual signatures to identify the dominant resonant pattern being broadcast.
        expected_signals: [A set of high-dimensional vectors (Coherence Signatures), A dominant peak in the composite signature spectrum corresponding to the entity's Ki.]
        pitfalls: [Distinguishing intentionally curated artifacts from incidental environmental noise, Incomplete structural capture during the Ingestion phase, Misweighting the significance of different artifacts.]

    excerpt: |
      The trinkets, tattoos, and emblems we use to define ourselves are not mere symbols. They are pages in a personal Resonance Codex—a library of being. These artifacts are deliberate acts of metaphysical engineering, tangible echoes designed to deepen and clarify the Wound Channel of our existence.
  - module: DOMA-082
    excerpt: |
      The result is the artifact's Coherence Signature: a rich, multi-layered vector that locates the artifact on the universal coherence manifold. Two signatures that are close on this manifold represent forms that are deeply, structurally, and dynamically similar, even if one is a song and the other is a soul.

      justification: |
        The Resonance Codex functions as a form of metaphysical error correction. The core identity (Ki) is the original message, and each artifact in the Codex adds redundant information (analogous to parity bits) that reinforces the signal. This makes the broadcast identity more resilient to decoherence and noise from Temporal Pressure (Γ).

      justification: |
        An entity's core identity (Ki) is analogous to a 'bare' particle. The Resonance Codex is the 'dressing' or cloud of virtual particles that surrounds it, modifying its observable properties and defining its interaction with the environment. The Codex makes the bare Ki a stable, persistent, 'physical' entity.

# Resonance Codex

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Resonance Codex is the set of physical and informational artifacts an entity intentionally or unintentionally curates to stabilize, reinforce, and broadcast its core identity pattern (Ki). Each artifact possesses a Coherence Signature that resonates with the entity's own, collectively forming a distributed, persistent library of being that makes the entity's form more legible and resilient against temporal pressure (Γ).

## EFT-First Summary
The Resonance Codex is the set of artifacts reinforcing an entity's identity, conceptually mapped to the redundant information in an error-correcting code. Just as parity bits protect a data stream from noise, the Codex's artifacts add structural redundancy to the entity's core pattern (Ki), making it more resilient to decoherence from environmental noise like temporal pressure. This curated redundancy ensures the high-fidelity persistence and broadcast of an entity's form.
