  art: |
    The art of building devices and processes to intentionally shape the riverbed of reality, choosing whether to compose a new harmony (Annealing), play a single perfect note in sync with the cosmos (Navigation), or listen for a startling improvisation (Harvesting).
  law: |
    Any successful act of temporal engineering can be modeled as an optimization of the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì), either by maximizing temporal coherence (K_œÑ), minimizing temporal pressure (V_Œì), or opportunistically capturing favorable environmental Lagrangian states.
  philosophy: |
    Temporal Engineering marks the transition from passive observation of reality's laws to active participation in its unfolding, reframing the Pirouette Lagrangian from a descriptive formula into a prescriptive engineering diagram for shaping outcomes.
pirouette_definition: |
  The practical discipline of designing and operating systems that manipulate the coherence manifold. It comprises three distinct arts‚ÄîCoherence Annealing, Geodesic Navigation, and Stochastic Harvesting‚Äîall of which are practical applications of optimizing the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì) through the use of conceptual devices like the Coherence Resonator and Lagrangian Transducer.

        outline: |
          For a given system attempting a task, measure its state and resource expenditure with and without the application of a temporal engineering technique. Calculate the system's effective Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) in both scenarios. A positive change in the net Lagrangian indicates a successful application of the art.
        expected_signals: [Increased task success rate, reduced energy consumption, formation of novel high-coherence structures, successful capture of stochastic events.]
        pitfalls: [Failure to properly isolate the system from environmental coherence fluctuations, mischaracterizing the target system's initial Ki pattern, choosing the wrong art for the optimization problem (e.g., trying to Anneal when Navigation is required).]

      We now face the Weaver's primary challenge: to move from understanding the universe to participating in its creation. A blueprint is not a house; a law is not an engine.

      These three arts are not arbitrary; they are direct, practical strategies for optimizing the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`)... This connection transforms the Lagrangian from a descriptive law into a prescriptive engineering diagram, providing the mathematical foundation for choosing the right tool for the right task.

    Distinct from speculative concepts of 'time travel,' Pirouette's Temporal Engineering does not manipulate causal sequence. It manipulates the *quality* and *efficiency* of a process *within* the established flow of time by reshaping the local coherence manifold, analogous to shaping a riverbed rather than reversing the river's flow.

# Temporal Engineering

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The practical discipline of designing and operating systems that manipulate the coherence manifold. It comprises three distinct arts‚ÄîCoherence Annealing, Geodesic Navigation, and Stochastic Harvesting‚Äîall of which are practical applications of optimizing the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì) through the use of conceptual devices like the Coherence Resonator and Lagrangian Transducer.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of control theory, Temporal Engineering is the application of optimal control strategies to the dynamics of the coherence manifold. The goal is to steer a system along a trajectory that optimizes the Pirouette Lagrangian, which acts as the cost functional. Its three primary strategies are analogous to creating new stable states (Annealing), following frictionless paths (Navigation), and exploiting beneficial environmental noise (Harvesting).
