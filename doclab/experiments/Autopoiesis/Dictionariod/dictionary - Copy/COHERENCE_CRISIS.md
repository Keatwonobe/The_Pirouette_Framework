    A river of coherence reaching a continental divide, where the single path forward shatters into a turbulent delta of possibilities before new channels are carved.
  law: |
    A system enters a Coherence Crisis when the gradient of its Pirouette Lagrangian (‚àáùìõ_p) approaches zero across multiple divergent paths, leading to a measurable collapse of its primary resonant frequency (Ki) and a spike in its chaotic energy signature (Turbulent Flow) preceding a state transition.
  philosophy: |
    A Coherence Crisis is not a system failure but the primary engine of novelty and evolution. It is the moment of maximum creative potential, where instability forces a system to transcend its old identity and choose a new future, making it the most potent point of leverage for intervention.
pirouette_definition: |
  A state of acute instability where a system's governing resonant pattern (Ki) can no longer be sustained under mounting Temporal Pressure (Œì). This occurs at a saddle point or flattened plateau on the coherence manifold, forcing a turbulent, non-deterministic bifurcation (a Watershed Event) where the system must resolve into one of several new, stable resonant patterns. The crisis is characterized by the collapse of laminar flow, the partitioning of the system's Wound Channel, and the divergence of its future state trajectories.

          1. Monitor the system's power spectrum to isolate its primary resonant pattern (Ki).
          2. Track the stability of Ki's amplitude and frequency. A crisis is heralded by amplitude flickering, mode-hopping, and a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio.
          3. Quantify the onset of turbulence by measuring the growth of broadband noise and the system's signal entropy.
          4. The crisis peak is the point of maximum entropy/turbulence, immediately preceding the system's collapse into a new, stable resonant pattern (Ki').

    excerpt: |
      A Watershed Event is a critical, creative, and often chaotic juncture where a system‚Äôs single, coherent path fractures into two or more distinct futures. This is not a failure, but a fundamental dynamic of evolution. It is a coherence crisis where a system‚Äôs resonant pattern (Ki) can no longer be sustained, forcing it to resolve its instability by becoming something new.
  - module: DOMA-133
    excerpt: |
      At the exact point of decision, coherence collapses. The system is thrown into a state of intense Turbulent Flow, a crucible where its energy is consumed by internal chaos as it "feels out" the multiple viable paths ahead. This is the critical point, a moment of maximum sensitivity where the smallest fluctuation can have an outsized impact on the outcome.

      justification: |
        A Coherence Crisis is a direct physical analogue of a bifurcation in a dynamical system. The system's state (governed by ùìõ_p) transitions from a single stable equilibrium (laminar flow) to a point where this equilibrium becomes unstable and multiple new stable states appear. The 'Turbulent Crucible' maps to the critical fluctuations and sensitivity to initial conditions near the bifurcation point.

    A 'Coherence Crisis' refers specifically to the unstable state of turbulent indecision at the cusp of a bifurcation. A 'Watershed Event' is the entire end-to-end process, including the approach, the crisis, and the divergent resolution into new stable states. The crisis is the peak of the event.

# Coherence Crisis

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A state of acute instability where a system's governing resonant pattern (Ki) can no longer be sustained under mounting Temporal Pressure (Œì). This occurs at a saddle point or flattened plateau on the coherence manifold, forcing a turbulent, non-deterministic bifurcation (a Watershed Event) where the system must resolve into one of several new, stable resonant patterns. The crisis is characterized by the collapse of laminar flow, the partitioning of the system's Wound Channel, and the divergence of its future state trajectories.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of dynamical systems, a Coherence Crisis is equivalent to a bifurcation point, particularly a saddle-node or pitchfork bifurcation. A system's state variable, governed by an effective potential (analogous to -ùìõ_p), reaches a local maximum or inflection point, causing the stable equilibrium (the 'resonant pattern') to vanish or split. The 'turbulence' corresponds to the critical fluctuations and extreme sensitivity to initial conditions at this point, as described in the theory of critical phenomena for second-order phase transitions.
