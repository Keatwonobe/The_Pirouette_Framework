        We sought a universe of isolated moments and found instead a single, unbroken tapestry. The past is never gone. It is embedded in the present as a physical, active geometry... This is the profound responsibility and the ultimate beauty of a universe that remembers.

  art: |
    The past is not a foreign country, but the very ground beneath our feet. The universe is a tapestry woven from the echoes of every choice, a physical geometry upon which the future must walk.
  law: |
    The total geometric information content of the universe (the state of the Assemblé) is non-decreasing. Every event adds a Wound Channel, a non-erasable record which contributes to the complexity of the whole.
  philosophy: |
    The universe is not a container for events but is the event itself, an ever-growing record of its own history. All entities are not merely actors within spacetime but are co-authors of its fundamental geometric structure.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Assemblé is the state of the universal coherence manifold, conceptualized as a single, unified geometric object. It is the cumulative and ever-growing tapestry formed by the integration of all Wound Channels left by all entities throughout history. It is the physical embodiment of the universe's memory, where the past persists as an active, influential geometry shaping the present.

        outline: |
          Direct measurement is not possible. Properties of the Assemblé are inferred by measuring the cumulative effect of many Wound Channels on a sensitive probe's Pirouette. This involves measuring deviations in the probe's trajectory or resonant frequency from predictions that neglect historical geometric influences.
        expected_signals: [Anomalous, non-local correlations in quantum entanglement; history-dependent inertia in precision mass measurements.]
        pitfalls: [The signal is expected to be incredibly weak, buried under all other physical noise; distinguishing a collective geometric effect from a new fundamental force.]

    excerpt: |
      We sought a universe of isolated moments and found instead a single, unbroken tapestry. The past is never gone. It is embedded in the present as a physical, active geometry. The Wound Channel is the loom upon which that tapestry is woven. Every action, every thought, every existence, no matter how small, contributes a new thread to this ever-deepening pattern.

    excerpt: |
      Myths, laws, languages, and traditions are vast, shared Wound Channels. They form a collective coherence manifold that guides the behavior of individuals, making certain thoughts and actions easier to adopt than others. History is the landscape of these collective echoes.

      justification: |
        The Assemblé posits that the past is physically real and geometrically imprinted on the present, influencing it directly. This resonates with the 'Block Universe' view from special relativity, where all moments in time are equally real, although Assemblé adds a dynamic, causal layer where the 'past' block actively shapes the 'present' block's dynamics.

  disambiguation: |
    Assemblé refers to the integrated whole of all Wound Channels, the entire 'tapestry'. A single 'Wound Channel' is just one thread. Do not confuse the total state of the universe with the individual geometric scars that compose it.

# Assemblé

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Assemblé is the state of the universal coherence manifold, conceptualized as a single, unified geometric object. It is the cumulative and ever-growing tapestry formed by the integration of all Wound Channels left by all entities throughout history. It is the physical embodiment of the universe's memory, where the past persists as an active, influential geometry shaping the present.

## EFT-First Summary
Currently, no direct mapping to an established Effective Field Theory (EFT) term exists for Assemblé, as it is a holistic, non-perturbative concept describing the universe's total geometric memory. It is most closely aligned with philosophical concepts like the Block Universe, but adds a causal, memory-based dynamic absent in static interpretations of that model.
