        The temporal-pressure potential (V(Γ)) supports only **three stable nodes** before resonance blow-up at (Γ=Γ_c), preventing a fourth generation.

  art: |
    The universe's score permits only a three-note chord. A fourth harmonic would shatter the instrument, so nature forbids it, leaving a stable triad of matter.
  law: |
    The temporal Helmholtz equation, under the influence of the temporal-pressure potential V(Γ) and cosmological damping, possesses exactly three stable, bound-state solutions. Any solution for n > 3 is unstable and experiences resonance blow-up, precluding the formation of a fourth fermion generation.
  philosophy: |
    The number of matter families is not an arbitrary parameter but a direct, non-negotiable consequence of temporal dynamics. It replaces a brute fact of the Standard Model with a principle of dynamical stability, asserting that the structure of reality is governed by a minimalist harmonic necessity.
pirouette_definition: |
  The dynamical constraint, derived from the stability analysis of the temporal-pressure potential V(Γ), that permits only three quantized, stable standing-wave modes (harmonics) for the Γ-field. These modes correspond to the three observed fermion generations. Higher-order modes (n ≥ 4) are dynamically unstable due to resonance blow-up at the electroweak–Planck coherence barrier (Γ_c), thus preventing the existence of a fourth generation. The limit is a fundamental prediction derived from the shape of V(Γ) and the current cosmological Hubble parameter (H_0).

      - name: Z-Boson Decay Width Analysis
        outline: |
          1. Produce a large sample of Z bosons (e.g., at an e+e- collider like LEP).
          2. Measure the total decay width (Γ_Z) of the Z boson from the shape of the production cross-section resonance curve.
          3. Subtract the calculated widths for all visible decay channels (hadrons, charged leptons).
          4. The remaining "invisible width" is attributed to decays into neutrino-antineutrino pairs (Z → νν̄).
          5. Divide the measured invisible width by the Standard Model prediction for a single neutrino species to obtain the number of light, active neutrino generations.
        expected_signals: [A measured value for N_ν statistically consistent with 3.0.]
        pitfalls: [Assumes neutrinos are light (m_ν < m_Z/2) and have standard electroweak couplings. A sterile or very heavy fourth-generation would not be counted.]
      - name: Direct Search for Fourth-Generation Fermions
        outline: |
          1. At a hadron collider (e.g., LHC), search for the production and decay of new heavy quarks (t', b') or charged leptons (τ').
          2. Analyze final states for characteristic signatures, such as high-pT leptons, jets, and missing transverse energy.
          3. Compare event yields to the Standard Model background prediction. An excess could indicate a new particle.
        expected_signals: [Null result. No statistically significant excess of events consistent with a fourth generation, setting lower mass bounds.]
        pitfalls: [Searches are limited by collider energy; a fourth generation could simply be too heavy to have been produced yet.]

    excerpt: |
      The temporal-pressure potential (V(Γ)) supports only **three stable nodes** before resonance blow-up at (Γ=Γ_c), preventing a fourth generation. Numerically, stability analysis of the wave equation with damping term (3H\dot{\Gamma}) yields exactly three bound states for the current cosmological (H_0), mirroring the observed number of families.
  - module: MATH-Γ-006
    excerpt: |
      A measured deviation from quadratic scaling beyond logarithmic corrections would falsify this harmonic quantization model. The prediction of "3 generations max" is confirmed to LHC bounds, and its violation would constitute a primary falsification event for the entire temporal resonance framework.

        The Standard Model takes the number of generations, N_g=3, as a fundamental, unexplained experimental input. The Pirouette Framework provides a dynamical origin for this number, mapping it to the count of stable solutions of its core temporal wave equation. It elevates N_g from a free parameter to a calculated constant of the theory.

# Three-Generation Limit

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The dynamical constraint, derived from the stability analysis of the temporal-pressure potential V(Γ), that permits only three quantized, stable standing-wave modes (harmonics) for the Γ-field. These modes correspond to the three observed fermion generations. Higher-order modes (n ≥ 4) are dynamically unstable due to resonance blow-up at the electroweak–Planck coherence barrier (Γ_c), thus preventing the existence of a fourth generation. The limit is a fundamental prediction derived from the shape of V(Γ) and the current cosmological Hubble parameter (H_0).

## EFT-First Summary
The Pirouette Framework provides a dynamical explanation for the Standard Model's empirically observed number of fermion generations, N_g=3. In the SM, this number is a free parameter determined by experiment (e.g., Z-boson decay width measurements). Pirouette recasts it as a calculated, necessary consequence of stability criteria within a more fundamental theory of temporal dynamics, thereby explaining what is otherwise an arbitrary feature of the observable universe.
