        Harmonic Compatibility: The fundamental Ki patterns of the two entities must be harmonically related. They need not be identical, but like notes in a musical chord, their frequencies must form a stable, non-dissonant ratio.

  art: |
    Like two notes in a chord, separate voices find a shared peace that is more than the sum of their songs.
  law: |
    The potential for Alchemical Union exists if and only if the ratio of the entities' fundamental Ki frequencies (κ₁/κ₂) resolves to a low-integer value, minimizing the beat frequency and destructive interference of their combined echo.
  philosophy: |
    Compatibility is a matter of relationship, not identity. It asserts that connection is governed by harmony, not similarity, establishing a universal principle where difference, correctly aligned, is the foundation of creative synthesis.
pirouette_definition: |
  A necessary condition for a Resonant Handshake, requiring that the fundamental Ki frequencies (κ) of two or more entities form a stable, non-dissonant ratio. This state of consonance allows for constructive interference between their respective coherence manifolds, reducing the energetic barrier to Alchemical Union. Systems lacking harmonic compatibility exhibit mutual repulsion or destructive interference, precluding synthesis.

        outline: |
          1. Isolate the two entities (A, B) in a low-Γ environment.
          2. Measure the fundamental Ki frequency of each entity independently (κ_A, κ_B).
          3. Bring the entities into proximity and measure the emergent beat frequency (Δκ) of their interacting echoes.
          4. Harmonic Compatibility (Cₕ) is inversely proportional to the normalized amplitude of Δκ. A value of Cₕ ≈ 1 corresponds to Δκ ≈ 0.

      Harmonic Compatibility: The fundamental Ki patterns of the two entities must be harmonically related. They need not be identical, but like notes in a musical chord, their frequencies must form a stable, non-dissonant ratio. An electron and a proton can find this harmony; two protons, by their nature, repel.

    excerpt: |
      A true dialogue is a human-scale Alchemical Union. Two minds, holding separate coherence manifolds (perspectives), engage in a Resonant Handshake by finding harmonic compatibility (shared values, common language) and phase alignment (listening, turn-taking).

        The principle directly maps to Pythagorean and just intonation concepts where simple integer ratios of frequencies (e.g., 3:2 for a perfect fifth) are harmonious. This suggests Ki frequency interaction is governed by similar mathematical principles of wave interference and stability.

    Distinguish from **Phase Alignment**. Harmonic Compatibility refers to the *ratio* of the fundamental frequencies (the 'what' of the notes), while Phase Alignment refers to the temporal synchronization of their wave cycles (the 'when' of the rhythm). Both are required for a Resonant Handshake.

# Harmonic Compatibility

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A necessary condition for a Resonant Handshake, requiring that the fundamental Ki frequencies (κ) of two or more entities form a stable, non-dissonant ratio. This state of consonance allows for constructive interference between their respective coherence manifolds, reducing the energetic barrier to Alchemical Union. Systems lacking harmonic compatibility exhibit mutual repulsion or destructive interference, precluding synthesis.

## EFT-First Summary
Currently, no direct one-to-one mapping to a Standard Model or EFT term is ratified. Conceptually, it aligns with principles of resonant coupling in oscillator physics and wave mechanics, where system stability is maximized and interaction energy is minimized at simple integer frequency ratios. It serves as a selection rule for which fundamental entities can enter into stable, composite states.
