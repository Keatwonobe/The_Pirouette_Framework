  art: |
    If frame stiffnesses are the coarse tension of an instrument's strings, the finite counterterms are the final, subtle turns of the tuning pegs. They reconcile the pure tone of the instrument's design with the specific acoustics of the hall, creating a perfect, observable harmony without changing the instrument itself.
  law: |
    The inverse-square of a gauge coupling (g_i) at the coherence barrier (\mu_c) equals the corresponding frame stiffness (K_i) plus a finite counterterm (\Delta_i). For the Pirouette framework to be predictive, these counterterms must be small corrections, i.e., (|\Delta_i| \ll K_i), consistent with being one-loop artifacts of the matching procedure.
  philosophy: |
    Finite counterterms embody the principle of epistemic humility at a theory boundary. They absorb the irreducible, scheme-dependent artifacts that arise when matching two distinct physical descriptions (a time-first UV, a QFT IR), ensuring that the physical predictions are robust while quarantining ignorance into small, observable-independent constants. They allow a seamless connection without reintroducing the fine-tuning the framework seeks to eliminate.
pirouette_definition: |
  A set of three dimensionless, observable-independent, and scheme-dependent constants, (\Delta_1, \Delta_2, \Delta_3), that appear in the barrier matching condition for the Yang–Mills gauge couplings. They are added to the frame stiffnesses ((K_i)) to define the value of the inverse-square couplings ((1/g_i^2)) at the coherence scale (\mu_c). By construction, they are finite (( \mathcal{O}(1/16\pi^2) )) and encode residual microphysical effects from the time-first domain not captured by the leading-order stiffnesses, thereby ensuring a consistent, gauge-invariant transition to the Standard Model Renormalization Group flow.

        outline: |
          (\Delta_i) are not directly measured but are inferred by a closure test.
          1. Measure low-energy gauge couplings (\alpha_i(M_Z)) with high precision.
          2. Evolve these couplings up to the coherence barrier scale (\mu_c) using 2-loop Standard Model RGEs, accounting for all particle thresholds. This determines the values of (g_i(\mu_c)).
          3. Obtain the theoretical priors for the frame stiffnesses ((K_i)) from the Pirouette Resonance Atlas (XXP-BRIDGE-Γ-001).
          4. Compute the counterterms via the matching condition: (\Delta_i = 1/g_i^2(\mu_c) - K_i).
          5. Verify that the resulting (\Delta_i) are small, as required by the framework's consistency.
        expected_signals: [A small, stable value for each (\Delta_i) across multiple experimental inputs.]
        pitfalls: [Errors in RGE evolution or threshold corrections can mimic or mask a genuine (\Delta_i). A poor determination of (\mu_c) or (K_i) priors will propagate directly into the inferred (\Delta_i).]

        In standard EFT, when integrating out a heavy particle of mass M, the matching condition between the full and effective theory couplings includes finite, scheme-dependent constants (like (\delta\lambda)). The (\Delta_i) play the exact mathematical role of these constants at the matching scale (\mu_c). The physical interpretation differs: Pirouette matches onto a time-first structure, not a theory with heavier particles.

  disambiguation: |
    In conventional QFT, "counterterms" are terms added to a Lagrangian to cancel UV divergences during renormalization. The Pirouette (\Delta_i) are explicitly *finite* and are not used to absorb infinities, which are posited to be absent by construction (MATH-Γ-007). They should be understood as finite matching constants, analogous to threshold corrections in EFT, not as tools for regularization.

# Finite Counterterms

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A set of three dimensionless, observable-independent, and scheme-dependent constants, (\Delta_1, \Delta_2, \Delta_3), that appear in the barrier matching condition for the Yang–Mills gauge couplings. They are added to the frame stiffnesses ((K_i)) to define the value of the inverse-square couplings ((1/g_i^2)) at the coherence scale (\mu_c). By construction, they are finite (( \mathcal{O}(1/16\pi^2) )) and encode residual microphysical effects from the time-first domain not captured by the leading-order stiffnesses, thereby ensuring a consistent, gauge-invariant transition to the Standard Model Renormalization Group flow.

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of Effective Field Theory (EFT), the Finite Counterterms (\Delta_i) are the direct analogues of **finite threshold corrections** that arise when matching a UV theory to an IR theory at a specific scale. Just as integrating out heavy particles in the Standard Model creates small, finite, scheme-dependent shifts in the couplings of the low-energy theory, the (\Delta_i) represent the finite corrections needed to match the time-first stiffness model onto the Standard Model at the coherence barrier (\mu_c). Their predicted smallness is a key testable feature of the Pirouette framework. (Ref: M.D. Schwartz, *QFT & SM*, Ch. 22).
