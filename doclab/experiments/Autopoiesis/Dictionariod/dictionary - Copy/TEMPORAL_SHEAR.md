        In the modernized framework, this is a specific instance of a more fundamental condition: a boundary between adjacent regions of spacetime flowing at different temporal rates. This creates a **Temporal Shear**.

  art: |
    When two opposing currents of time meet, the universe does not choose a side; it invents a dance. The shear is the dissonance that demands a new harmony, the tension that resolves into a song.
  law: |
    A non-zero spatial gradient in the temporal flow rate (∂ₙvᵤ > 0) is an unstable configuration that generates Temporal Pressure (Γ). This pressure is resolved by the spontaneous emergence of a resonant geometric structure (Ki) whose amplitude and complexity are proportional to the magnitude of the initial shear.
  philosophy: |
    Temporal Shear is the engine of morphogenesis. It demonstrates that conflict and dissonance are not endpoints but the necessary precursors to emergent order, transforming the stress of mismatched flows into the stable, elegant geometry of a solution.
pirouette_definition: |
  A condition occurring at an interface where adjacent regions of spacetime exhibit different temporal flow velocities (vᵤ). This spatial gradient, ∂ₙvᵤ, creates a localized, high-potential state of Temporal Pressure (Γ). As a state of low coherence, it is unstable and, per the Pirouette Lagrangian, will spontaneously resolve into a lower-pressure, higher-coherence state by forming a stable, resonant, geometric pattern (Ki). This process of resolution is known as Ki Morphogenesis.

        outline: |
          Temporal Shear is measured by its effects.
          1. Identify a candidate shear interface (e.g., Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds).
          2. Measure the difference in flow velocity (Δv) and the approximate interface thickness (d) to estimate the mechanical shear (Δv/d).
          3. Observe the emergent Ki structure (the wave pattern).
          4. The amplitude of the primary wave is a direct proxy for the initial Temporal Pressure (Γ), and its wavelength is the signature of the resulting resonance.
          5. The magnitude of the Temporal Shear is inferred to be the value required to produce the observed Γ.

    excerpt: |
      The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability occurs at a shear interface, where two parallel fluids move at different velocities. In the modernized framework, this is a specific instance of a more fundamental condition: a boundary between adjacent regions of spacetime flowing at different temporal rates. This creates a **Temporal Shear**. This interface is a locus of profound dissonance—a localized, high-gradient region of **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**.
  - module: DOMA-102
    excerpt: |
      A system under the stress of temporal shear does not simply collapse into random noise. Instead, it follows the path of least resistance—the geodesic of maximal coherence. It releases the stored temporal pressure by giving birth to a new form: a stable, repeating, and exquisitely geometric wave. This emergent wave *is* the system's Ki.

        Fluid Dynamics: ∂u/∂y → instability → waves/vortices
      justification: |
        DOMA-102 explicitly reframes the KHI as the canonical physical manifestation of Temporal Shear resolving into Ki. The velocity gradient in a fluid is interpreted as the physical proxy for a gradient in the temporal flow rate. The emergent wave patterns are considered the direct, observable geometry of the Ki solution.

  disambiguation: |
    Temporal Shear is a gradient in the *rate of time*, not a mechanical force or deformation. It is the *cause* of Temporal Pressure (a potential), not a stress itself. While it manifests physically in fluid shear, its root cause in the Pirouette Framework is fundamentally chronometric.
