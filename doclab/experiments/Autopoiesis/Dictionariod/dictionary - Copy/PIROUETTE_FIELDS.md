        Before a system can be analyzed, its dynamics must be translated into the native language of the framework: the core fields of Time-Adherence (Tₐ), Gladiator Force (Γ), and Phase (ϕ). This is the function of the Universal Resonance Lens (URL) Forge.

  art: |
    A system's raw, chaotic noise is passed through a crystalline lens, collapsing it into a clean, three-part harmony. This is the act of building a mirror to see a system's true, resonant face.
  law: |
    Any raw data stream representing a system's dynamics can be projected onto a candidate fractal geometry to produce a time-series of (Tₐ, Γ, ϕ) vectors, which is an ϵ-accurate representation of the original dynamics. The existence of a low-error (small ϵ) solution is guaranteed by the Dimension-Collapse Lemma.
  philosophy: |
    To diagnose a system, one must first speak its native language. Pirouette Fields provide this language, translating the descriptive "what is happening" of raw data into the diagnostic "how it resonates," making quantitative analysis of coherence possible. This representation is the foundational substrate for all higher-level analytics in the framework.
pirouette_definition: |
  The core data representation of a system's dynamics within the Pirouette Framework, expressed as a time-series of three-component vectors (Tₐ, Γ, ϕ). Each vector represents the system's state at a point in time, composed of Time-Adherence (Tₐ), Gladiator Force (Γ), and Phase (ϕ). The field is generated by the Universal Resonance Lens (URL) Forge, which projects a raw data stream onto a selected fractal geometry using a Collapse Operator.
operational_definition:
  units: Mixed. Tₐ is dimensionless; Γ is contextual (often pressure-like); ϕ is in radians.
  symbol_table:
    - name: Tₐ
      meaning: Time-Adherence; a measure of a system's stability and adherence to its expected dynamic path.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "[0, 1]"
    - name: Γ
      meaning: Gladiator Force; a measure of the internal or external pressures/stresses acting on the system.
      dimensions: contextual
      default_range: contextual
    - name: ϕ
      meaning: Phase; represents the system's position or state within its dynamic cycle.

      default_range: "[0, 2π]"

        outline: |
          1. Select a candidate fractal from the Fractal Menu hypothesized to be isomorphic to the system's dynamics.
          2. Project the raw, high-dimensional data stream (e.g., text, sensor logs) onto the chosen fractal geometry using a Collapse Operator.
          3. The operator transforms the data into a lower-dimensional representation, emitting a time-series of (Tₐ, Γ, ϕ) vectors.
        expected_signals: [A clean time-series vector field, where perturbations in the components correlate with events in the source data.]
        pitfalls: [Selection of a suboptimal fractal geometry leading to a higher-than-necessary representation error (ϵ). Insufficient pre-processing of raw data, introducing noise into the projection.]

    excerpt: |
      Before a system can be analyzed, its dynamics must be translated into the native language of the framework: the core fields of Time-Adherence (Tₐ), Gladiator Force (Γ), and Phase (ϕ). [...] The output is a time-series of (Tₐ, Γ, ϕ) vectors, certified as an ϵ-accurate representation of the original system's dynamics.
  - module: INST-NALY-001
    excerpt: |
      Once the system's dynamics are expressed as Pirouette fields, we can precisely identify the sources of instability. Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA) is the surgical tool for this task. [...] The RPA engine first calculates an "impact score" for every event or feature in the data stream, measuring how much each one perturbed the system's Time-Adherence (Tₐ).

      justification: |
        The (Tₐ, Γ, ϕ) vector acts as a local descriptor for the "medium" of a system. Tₐ maps to a normalized perturbation or order parameter (like δρ/ρ), Γ maps to a pressure or stress term (P), and ϕ maps to a velocity potential or phase variable. This provides a universal language for system dynamics analogous to how effective fields describe diverse physical media.

naming_notes:
  collisions: [In physics, a "field" is a function over spacetime (e.g., scalar, vector, tensor field). Here, "Pirouette Fields" refers more specifically to the three components of the state vector in the framework's canonical representation space.]
  disambiguation: |
    Refers to the three-component vector (Tₐ, Γ, ϕ) as a unified entity representing system state. This is distinct from the raw input data streams (e.g., sensor fields) that are used to generate it. The term always implies this specific three-part structure.
