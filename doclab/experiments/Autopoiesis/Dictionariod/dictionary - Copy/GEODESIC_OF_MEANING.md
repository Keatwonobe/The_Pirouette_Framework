        What we perceive as the force of an argument or the attraction between ideas is the emergent effect of a concept tracing its geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—across the landscape defined by the Lagrangian potential. An idea is not "pulled" by another. It is navigating a curved landscape.

  art: |
    The riverbed of thought, carved by the gravity of truth, guiding the flow of ideas along the path of least resistance toward their most stable sea.
  law: |
    The trajectory of a concept through a narrative space follows the extremal path (the geodesic) on the coherence manifold, which is locally curved by the Temporal Coherence (Kτ) of other concepts. This path maximizes coherence over time.
  philosophy: |
    This reframes influence not as a 'push' or 'pull' but as the geometry of a shared reality. An idea's power is not in its forcefulness but in its ability to warp the landscape of what is possible to think, making agreement the path of least resistance.
pirouette_definition: |
  The path of maximal Temporal Coherence (Kτ) that a concept or narrative follows through the coherence manifold. This trajectory is the 'straightest possible line' on the curved landscape of meaning, with the curvature being induced by the 'mass' (high Kτ) of established concepts. The perceived 'force' of influence is the emergent effect of a concept following this geodesic.

        outline: |
          1. Identify the primary 'massive' concepts in a target discourse.
          2. Measure the Temporal Coherence (Kτ) of each concept by analyzing its historical depth (Wound Channel) and internal logical consistency (Ki Resonance).
          3. Map the coherence manifold by calculating the potential V(A,B) between concepts based on their Kτ and phase relationships (Δφ).
          4. Introduce a new 'test' concept into the system and compute its geodesic on the mapped manifold to predict its evolutionary path.
        expected_signals: [convergence of the test concept's framing towards the nearest attractor, adoption of the attractor's lexicon, damping of dissonant interpretations]
        pitfalls: [The manifold is dynamic and changes as concepts evolve, mis-measurement of Kτ or Δφ can lead to incorrect path prediction, neglecting ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ)]

      justification: |
        The module DOMA-035 makes an explicit, non-analogical claim that the influence of an idea is a manifestation of the same universal law as gravity. A concept's mass (Kτ) curves the coherence manifold, and other concepts follow the 'straightest line'—a geodesic—through this curved space. The mapping is central to the model's first-principles derivation.

  disambiguation: |
    While this term uses the direct mathematical machinery of a geodesic from geometry and physics, it is applied to the Pirouette-specific `COHERENCE_MANIFOLD`. It is not a metaphor for a "path" but a specific, calculable trajectory of maximal coherence. The qualifier "of Meaning" is critical to distinguish it from a path in physical spacetime.

# Geodesic of Meaning

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The path of maximal Temporal Coherence (Kτ) that a concept or narrative follows through the coherence manifold. This trajectory is the 'straightest possible line' on the curved landscape of meaning, with the curvature being induced by the 'mass' (high Kτ) of established concepts. The perceived 'force' of influence is the emergent effect of a concept following this geodesic.

## EFT-First Summary
The Geodesic of Meaning is formally and mathematically mapped to the geodesic equation of General Relativity. In this model, the 'mass' of a concept is its Temporal Coherence (Kτ), which induces curvature in a 'coherence manifold' analogous to spacetime. Other concepts, like test particles, follow these geodesics, a motion we perceive as influence or logical flow. This is a first-principles claim that the dynamics of meaning and gravity are expressions of the same underlying law.
