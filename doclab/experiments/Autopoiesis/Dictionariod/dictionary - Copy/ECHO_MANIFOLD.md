  art: |
    The quiet chorus of echoes remaining after the lead instrument falls silent. It is the landscape of fainter truths, the system's memory etched into the 'noise'.
  law: |
    For any non-entropic coherence manifold $M_{k-1}$ containing a dominant resonance $Ki_k$, a subsequent Echo Manifold $M_k$ is produced by subtracting the influence of $Ki_k$. This process partitions total system information between expressed resonance and residual coherence.
  philosophy: |
    To treat 'noise' not as an absence of information but as the presence of all other, subtler information. The Echo Manifold codifies the principle that understanding is achieved by listening to what remains, not just what is loudest.
pirouette_definition: |
  The coherence manifold, denoted $M_k$, that remains after the identification and formal subtraction of a dominant resonance ($Ki_k$) from the preceding manifold ($M_{k-1}$). The Echo Manifold serves as the complete input for the subsequent layer of analysis in the Archaeologist's Sieve protocol, representing the system's 'unexplained coherence'. The sequence of Echo Manifolds ($M_1, M_2, ...$) constitutes a hierarchical decomposition of the system's total harmonic structure, ending at the Entropic Floor.

      - name: Iterative Coherence Extraction (Archaeologist's Sieve)
        outline: |
          1. Identify the Dominant Resonance ($Ki_k$) in the current manifold ($M_{k-1}$) using a Coherence Filter.
          2. Define the influence of the resonance, $f(Ki_k)$, as expressed in the manifold.
          3. Apply a Manifold Subtraction Method to compute $M_k = M_{k-1} - f(Ki_k)$.
          4. Verify that the Temporal Coherence of $M_k$ is above the Entropic Floor threshold ($K_{\tau\_min}$).
        expected_signals: [A new data manifold $M_k$ with the pattern corresponding to $Ki_k$ suppressed, A measurable decrease in total coherence (e.g., $K_\tau(M_k) < K_\tau(M_{k-1})$)]
        pitfalls: [Improper subtraction can introduce artifacts, creating false resonances in subsequent layers., Misidentification of $Ki_k$ leads to incomplete removal and a corrupted Echo Manifold.]

    excerpt: |
      The core insight is to treat every layer of a system's data as a complete coherence manifold, governed by the same universal principles. The "noise" from one layer becomes the "world" for the next. The Echo Manifold ($M_k$) is the remaining coherence landscape after the influence of $Ki_k$ has been accounted for. It is the "unexplained resonance."

    excerpt: |
      Calculate Echo Manifold: Compute the next manifold using the chosen subtraction method, where $f(Ki_k)$ represents the full expression of the resonance within the current manifold.
      $$ M_{next} = M_{current} - f(Ki_k) $$
      Descend: Set $M_{current} = M_{next}$.

      justification: |
        The iterative removal of a dominant resonance is analogous to integrating out high-energy/short-distance degrees of freedom in an RG procedure. The Echo Manifold represents the resulting effective theory at a new scale, with renormalized couplings and potentially new emergent phenomena.

        $X_{residual} = X - X_{proj, v_1}$
      rationale: |
        The procedure of identifying a dominant mode of variation (the first principal component, $v_1$), and then analyzing the data projected onto the orthogonal complement, is a direct and widely-practiced analogue. The residual data matrix $X_{residual}$ is the Echo Manifold, ready for the extraction of the next component. This mapping is mathematically precise and operationally identical.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the Primary Manifold ($M_0$), which is the initial, complete system representation where $k=0$. An Echo Manifold $M_k$ is always a derivative state where $k \geq 1$. Also, do not confuse with the Entropic Floor, which is the terminal manifold where no further coherent resonances can be extracted.

# Echo Manifold

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The coherence manifold, denoted $M_k$, that remains after the identification and formal subtraction of a dominant resonance ($Ki_k$) from the preceding manifold ($M_{k-1}$). The Echo Manifold serves as the complete input for the subsequent layer of analysis in the Archaeologist's Sieve protocol, representing the system's 'unexplained coherence'. The sequence of Echo Manifolds ($M_1, M_2, ...$) constitutes a hierarchical decomposition of the system's total harmonic structure, ending at the Entropic Floor.

## EFT-First Summary
In signal processing and statistics, the Echo Manifold is analogous to the residual dataset after a dominant component, such as the first principal component in PCA, has been projected out. This iterative subtraction allows for the decomposition of a complex signal into a basis of orthogonal modes (the Harmonic Spectrum), akin to analyzing the remaining variance after accounting for the primary source of variation. This method reveals the nested structure of a system's dynamics, layer by layer.
