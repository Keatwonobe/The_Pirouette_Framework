    To predict the path of a river is science. To sculpt the landscape so the river flows where you wish is the work of the Weaver. Coherence Engineering is composing the music that compels the universe to dance.
  law: |
    For any system with knowable dynamics, a desired behavioral state (e.g., a specific periodic orbit, a target stability level) can be treated as a boundary condition. This allows for the direct, mathematical calculation of the precise environmental parameters (e.g., Temporal Pressure Γ) required to make that state a dominant attractor.
  philosophy: |
    This practice represents a fundamental shift in agency, from passive observation to active composition. It asserts that the laws of dynamics are not merely constraints to be obeyed, but levers to be pulled, transforming the practitioner from a spectator into a co-creator of systemic outcomes.
pirouette_definition: |
  Coherence Engineering is the practice of designing and imposing a specific potential energy landscape (environmental pressure, `V_Γ`) onto a system to ensure that its trajectory of maximal coherence (its path of least action) evolves into a pre-specified kinetic state (`K_τ`). It is the formal method of inverting a system's dynamics, treating a desired outcome as an input to solve for the necessary initial and boundary conditions.

        outline: |
          1.  **Declare Target Resonance:** Specify a desired system behavior, such as a period-`p` orbit or a target stability `λ*`.
          2.  **Formulate Coherence Equation:** Translate the desire into a root-finding problem, e.g., finding the parameter `r` that satisfies `f_r^(p)(x) - x = 0` for a period-p orbit.
          3.  **Solve for Pressure:** Use numerical methods to solve the equation for `r`, yielding the precise environmental pressure (`Γ` proxy) required to generate the target behavior.
        expected_signals: [A system trajectory that reliably settles into the prescribed resonant pattern.]
        pitfalls: [Assuming the model is a perfect representation of the physical system, numerical instability during the solve, overlooking more powerful nearby attractors.]

    excerpt: |
      Conventional analysis asks a passive question: "Given these conditions, what will happen?" This module introduces a more potent, active one: "Given this desired outcome, what conditions must we create?" It refactors the simple logistic map into a foundational instrument for Coherence Engineering. We shift from observing the dance of chaos and order to composing the music that compels it.
  - module: DOMA-142
    excerpt: |
      The Resonance Tuner inverts this. We *prescribe* the desired path—the target `K_τ` (a specific orbit or stability). The protocol then solves for the one specific potential `V_Γ` (the necessary pressure `r`) that makes our chosen path the solution with the maximal action. We are not discovering the path of least resistance; we are sculpting the entire coherence manifold so that the path of least resistance leads exactly where we intend.

      justification: |
        Coherence Engineering directly formulates system design as an inverse problem. Instead of computing effects from known causes (the forward problem), it infers the necessary causes (environmental parameters) required to produce a desired effect (a specific system behavior). This is a one-to-one conceptual match.

    - target: Optimal Control Theory
      domain: Engineering
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The practice aligns with optimal control, which seeks to find a control law for a given system such that a certain optimality criterion is achieved. Here, the 'control' is the sculpted environmental pressure Γ, and the 'optimality criterion' is the emergence of a specific resonant state.

    - target: Inverse Problem
      rationale: This is the most general and accurate mathematical framing of the core activity described in DOMA-142, preceding more domain-specific applications like control theory.

  claims:
    - statement: "For any system whose dynamics can be modeled by an equation with a controllable parameter (e.g., `r` in the logistic map), a specific periodic behavior can be induced by setting the parameter to a value calculated via the Resonance Tuner protocol."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Demonstration of a system where, despite accurately modeling its dynamics and calculating the required parameter value, the system consistently fails to enter the predicted attractor. This would imply either the model is incomplete or the principle is not universally applicable."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from classical 'Systems Control,' which often implies continuous, reactive feedback loops. Coherence Engineering is primarily about *a priori* design of the system's environment to create innate, stable attractors—a "set and forget" approach to sculpting a system's destiny.
