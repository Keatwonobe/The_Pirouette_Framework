        - Cognitive chirps: brief coherence breaks followed by task resumption
  editors: [Agent-Scribe]
  review_log: []
triad:
  art: |
    A sharp note cutting through the melody, not to spoil it, but to test the musician's return to the theme. It is the mental flinch that becomes a reflex, a staccato beat in the rhythm of thought that strengthens the overall composition.
  law: |
    A deliberately induced, consciously perceived, task-irrelevant stimulus lasting <500ms, which interrupts a primary cognitive task. Efficacy is measured by a statistically significant decrease in task re-acquisition time (Δt_r) over a training block of N>50 chirps.
  philosophy: |
    Cognitive fragility arises from an intolerance to interruption. By practicing the act of being broken and immediately reassembling, the mind is tempered. Cognitive chirps transform interruption from a vulnerability into a trainable tool for building antifragile focus.
pirouette_definition: |
  A training technique involving the deliberate introduction of brief, patterned, and recoverable interruptions (ϟ) into a focused cognitive workflow. The objective is to decrease the time and cognitive load required to re-establish task coherence, thereby training an agent's resilience to high-stochasticity environments and developing interruptive-adaptive cognition. It is a core drill in the Weaver Crucible.
operational_definition:
  units: seconds (s), milliseconds (ms)
  symbol_table:
    - name: ϟ
      meaning: A single Cognitive Chirp event (the disruptive stimulus).
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: N/A
    - name: Δt_c
      meaning: Chirp duration; the time the disruptive stimulus is active.
      dimensions: T
      default_range: 100-500 ms
    - name: Δt_r
      meaning: Task re-acquisition time; latency from chirp offset to resumption of correct task performance.
      dimensions: T
      default_range: 200 ms - 2 s
  measurement:
    procedures:
      - name: Chirp-Recovery Latency Test
        outline: |
          1. Subject engages in a continuous, performance-tracked cognitive task (e.g., logic puzzle, transcription).
          2. At pseudo-random intervals, a disruptive stimulus (auditory tone, visual flash) is presented for a fixed duration (Δt_c).
          3. Measure the time from the offset of the stimulus to the first correct action resuming the primary task. This is Δt_r.
          4. A training block consists of N trials, tracking the mean and variance of Δt_r. A negative slope in mean Δt_r indicates successful training.
        expected_signals: [EEG P300 component, galvanic skin response, task performance metrics (speed, accuracy)]
        pitfalls: [Subject habituation to the stimulus, task difficulty confounding re-acquisition time, overly disruptive chirps causing task abandonment]

      Module Inputs:
      - Bilateral stimulation training (known from EMDR and other neuro-regulatory practices)
      - Interruption-based drills: dual-channel story, audio echo, logic puzzle redirection
      - Cognitive chirps: brief coherence breaks followed by task resumption
      - Fractal reassembly tasks: scrambled system to coherent narrative

      Canonical Use Case: The Weaver Crucible
      We hypothesize that a group trained using this method:
      - Exhibits increased $T_a$ under high-stochasticity environments
      - Adapts quickly to fractured input domains (multi-agent, multi-signal)
      - Can maintain multi-phase attention and resolve contradictions quickly
      - Develops resilience to decoherence attacks (propaganda, attention fragmentation)

      domain: Cognitive Science
      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        The operational measurement of "task re-acquisition time" (Δt_r) is a direct analogue to the "switch cost" latency measured in task-switching paradigms. The training protocol is an explicit attempt to reduce this cognitive cost through repeated, controlled exposure, thereby enhancing top-down attentional control and cognitive flexibility.

  claims:
    - statement: "Training with cognitive chirps (ϟ) measurably reduces task re-acquisition time (Δt_r) and improves performance in high-stochasticity environments."
      domain: experiment
      falsifier: "A control group undergoing standard focused-attention training without chirps shows equal or greater improvement on target metrics, or the chirp group shows no statistically significant reduction in Δt_r over time."

  disambiguation: |
    Cognitive Chirps are consciously perceived, task-irrelevant stimuli designed to be actively overcome. They should not be confused with subliminal messaging, which operates below the threshold of conscious perception, or with micro-expressions, which are involuntary emotional cues.
