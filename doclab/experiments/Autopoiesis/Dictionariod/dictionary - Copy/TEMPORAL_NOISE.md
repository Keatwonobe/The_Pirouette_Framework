      snippet: |
        The Second Law of Thermodynamics is thus framed as the Principle of
        Coherence Degradation, where stable patterns are inevitably eroded by ambient
        temporal noise, a process that life and the Alchemical Union locally and temporarily
        reverse.

  art: |
    The universe trends toward silence, and this is its static. It is the ceaseless hiss of unformed potential eroding the shores of every distinct song.
  law: |
    The rate of coherence degradation (dKτ/dt) for any system not actively pumping entropy is directly proportional to the local intensity of Temporal Noise. In any realizable volume, this rate is fundamentally non-zero.
  philosophy: |
    Noise is not a flaw in the cosmos but the precondition for meaning. Without the resistance of the chaotic, coherence would be effortless and thus carry no information; form is defined and valued by its struggle against formlessness.
pirouette_definition: |
  Temporal Noise is the constant, disruptive interaction of a system's coherence pattern (Kτ) with the chaotic, unstructured component of the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the primary mechanism of the Principle of Coherence Degradation, introducing dissonance that erodes a system's information content over time. This is the physical manifestation of the `V_Γ` "cost of being" term in the Pirouette Lagrangian.

        outline: |
          1. Prepare a system in a state of maximal coherence (e.g., a large-scale quantum entangled state, a perfect crystal lattice).
          2. Isolate the system from all known sources of decoherence (thermal, electromagnetic, seismic) to the greatest extent possible (e.g., cryogenic temperatures, vacuum, shielding).
          3. Measure the rate of coherence decay (e.g., T2 decoherence time, rate of defect formation).
          4. The residual, non-zero decay rate is attributed to the baseline Temporal Noise of the local environment.

    excerpt: |
      Entropy is a measure of the dissonance of the local **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**. It is not the amount of energy in a region, but its chaotic, incoherent, and unstructured nature. It is "vacant energy"—energy not bound into a stable resonance and therefore unavailable for coherent work. It is the static, the background noise, the roar of the Temporal Forge (CORE-003) that threatens to drown out every clear note.
  - module: DOMA-062
    excerpt: |
      A coherent system is a river of information flowing through the landscape of entropic noise... However, the system is never truly isolated. It is perpetually bombarded by the dissonant echoes of the surrounding Γ. This constant interaction inevitably introduces noise into its Kτ pattern, "eroding" its coherence over time.

      equation_hint: |
        dρ/dt = -i[H, ρ] + L(ρ), where L(ρ) is driven by coupling to a bath representing σ_Γ.
      justification: |
        Temporal Noise describes the unavoidable interaction of a coherent system with its chaotic environment (Γ), causing a loss of information (coherence degradation). This is operationally identical to how environmental decoherence erodes a quantum system's purity by entangling it with the innumerable, un-tracked degrees of freedom of its surroundings. The "dissonant echoes of Γ" serve as the universal "bath" of environmental oscillators.

        The SGWB is a pervasive, irreducible "noise" in spacetime itself, originating from a superposition of countless cosmic events. This aligns with the concept of Temporal Noise as the "dissonant echoes" of cosmic history, acting as a universal source of perturbation.

    - statement: "Temporal Noise is anisotropic and varies with cosmic structure; its intensity should be measurably higher within a galaxy than in an intergalactic void."

  disambiguation: |
    Temporal Noise is not equivalent to classical thermal noise. Thermal noise is a component of the total dissonance within the local Γ, but Temporal Noise is more fundamental, existing even at T=0 as the baseline chaotic energy of spacetime itself. It is the cause of quantum decoherence, not a consequence of temperature.
