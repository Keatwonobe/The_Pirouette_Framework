        Derive the QED vertex (q,\bar\Psi\gamma^\mu A_\mu\Psi) from local synchronization of time-phase clocks between the Ki-defect spinor (\Psi) and the temporal medium (MATH-QED-001), and quantize (q) via a Berry phase around the spinor’s closed Ki loop (MATH-QED-002). Establish charge universality as a single U(1) clock, and isolate clean falsifiables.

    Charge is the number of turns an internal clock must make to come back to itself. Universality is the law that all fundamental particles listen to the tick of the very same clock.
  law: |
    All fundamental particles with electric charge couple to the same U(1) gauge field (`A_μ`) with a charge `q` that is an integer multiple of a fundamental unit `q_0`. This universality is a direct consequence of a single, shared time-phase clock (`θ(x)`) governing all interactions.
  philosophy: |
    Charge Universality reduces a fundamental empirical observation to a first principle of system coherence: interaction is synchronization. Instead of multiple charge types and couplings, there is one temporal medium and one rule for how defects (particles) must align their internal phases with it. This elevates a parameter to a postulate about the unified nature of time.

  The principle that all spinor Ki-defects (charged leptons) couple to the same temporal medium gauge field (`A_μ`) with the same coupling constant magnitude. It is derived from the postulate of a single, shared U(1) time-phase clock (`θ(x)`) whose local re-labelings (`α(x)`) govern the phase transformations of both the medium and all matter fields identically. This single clock ensures that the energetic cost of synchronization—the interaction vertex—is universally structured.

        The SM posits a single U(1)_em gauge group, which axiomatically enforces that all charged particles couple to the same photon field with charges that are rational multiples of `e/3`. Pirouette's "single clock postulate" provides a candidate physical origin for this axiomatic structure.

# Charge Universality

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The principle that all spinor Ki-defects (charged leptons) couple to the same temporal medium gauge field (`A_μ`) with the same coupling constant magnitude. It is derived from the postulate of a single, shared U(1) time-phase clock (`θ(x)`) whose local re-labelings (`α(x)`) govern the phase transformations of both the medium and all matter fields identically. This single clock ensures that the energetic cost of synchronization—the interaction vertex—is universally structured.

## EFT-First Summary
Charge Universality maps directly to the principle of universal electric charge coupling in the Standard Model of particle physics. This empirical cornerstone, which states that all fundamental particles couple to the single U(1) electromagnetic field with charges quantized in units of `e/3`, is explained in the Pirouette Framework as a consequence of all matter synchronizing its internal phase to a single, background U(1) clock. Experiments have verified this principle to extremely high precision (e.g., Peskin & Schroeder, *An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*).
