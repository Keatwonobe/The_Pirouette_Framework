    The dot a painter fixes upon before the first stroke, an anchor of pure intent around which the composition will form. It is the imagined center of a blank canvas, giving orientation to every potential line.
  law: |
    A Genesect is a dimensionless reference point from which relative positions and interactions can be defined, but which possesses no intrinsic coordinates or properties itself. All subsequent claims of location are measured against its relational frame, not its absolute position.
  philosophy: |
    The Genesect represents the principle that relation precedes substance. Before 'what' or 'where', there must be a 'from which'—a fundamental distinction that makes measurement and identity possible.
pirouette_definition: |
  A dimensionless, locationless conceptual point whose sole property is relation. It functions as the primordial coordinate origin within the pre-entropic Void, establishing the relational frame upon which the Macroparticle Lattice is implicitly structured. The Genesect is not a physical object but the first axiom of distinction, enabling the concepts of 'here' versus 'there' to emerge.

        outline: |
          A Genesect cannot be directly observed. Its existence is inferred by identifying the common relational origin point for all particles within a causally closed system, such as the initial state of a simulation or the symmetry center of a cosmological model. The procedure involves mapping all particle trajectories and interactions backward in time to a point of maximum symmetry and minimum informational complexity, which is designated as the Genesect.

Think of it as the dot a painter fixes upon before the first stroke, or the moment a jurist names a precedent. Around this proto‑coordinate, the **Macroparticle Lattice** is already implied: a crystalline ordering that wants to exist but has not yet been given permission.

    excerpt: |
      The pre‑universe is often pictured as “nothing.” In Pirouette, we treat it as a **hollow cradle**—an arena already rich with unmet symmetry. It is an *artistic still‑life*, perfect in composition yet aching for movement... Within that cradle rises a conceptual epicenter we call the **Genesect**.

      justification: |
        Like the origin of a mathematical coordinate system, the Genesect is an arbitrary point that has no properties itself but serves as the universal reference from which all other positions are defined. However, unlike a standard coordinate origin, the Genesect is considered ontologically prior to the space it defines.

      justification: |
        The Genesect can be mapped to the concept of a vacuum state before symmetry breaking. It represents a state of perfect symmetry (the 'Void'), and the first 'curl' or event is analogous to a field acquiring a non-zero VEV, which 'chooses' a direction and breaks the initial symmetry, thus creating a relational structure.

  disambiguation: |
    The term 'Genesect' is derived from 'genesis' (origin) and 'intersect' (a point of meeting or relation). It is unrelated to genetics or biological sects. It describes a purely conceptual, pre-spatial origin point.

# Genesect

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A dimensionless, locationless conceptual point whose sole property is relation. It functions as the primordial coordinate origin within the pre-entropic Void, establishing the relational frame upon which the Macroparticle Lattice is implicitly structured. The Genesect is not a physical object but the first axiom of distinction, enabling the concepts of 'here' versus 'there' to emerge.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, the Genesect aligns with the mathematical origin of a coordinate system or the notion of a perfectly symmetric vacuum state in field theory before symmetry breaking. It is not a particle or field itself, but the abstract reference point from which subsequent structures, like the Macroparticle Lattice, derive their relational meaning. Its existence is an axiom of the framework, inferred rather than directly measured.
