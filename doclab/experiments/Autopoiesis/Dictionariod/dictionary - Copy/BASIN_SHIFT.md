        Reconfiguration (Basin Shift): It collapses into a new, different, and typically simpler Ki pattern. It "forgets" its complex identity and adopts a more primitive one.

  art: |
    A complex song, forgotten, becomes a simple chant. The river, having breached its banks, finds a new, shallower bed. The system survives, but as a ghost of its former self.
  law: |
    Following a coherence cascade failure, a system re-stabilizes at a new resonant pattern (Ki') whose information complexity is strictly less than the original (Ki). This transition is irreversible without a significant external injection of coherence and information.
  philosophy: |
    A Basin Shift demonstrates that survival is not synonymous with flourishing. It is the universe's default solution to unsustainable complexity: a retreat to a simpler, more robust form. This reveals a fundamental pressure toward simplification, where stability is purchased at the cost of nuance and potential.
pirouette_definition: |
  The reconfiguration of a system into a new, stable, but typically simpler resonant pattern (Ki') following a coherence cascade failure. This occurs when systemic drift (Coherence Erosion) degrades the original Ki beyond a critical threshold, forcing the system to settle into a different, lower-energy attractor basin in its state space. A Basin Shift represents a permanent loss of systemic information and complexity, a form of survival via simplification.

          1. Establish a baseline measurement of the system's resonant spectrum (Ki) and calculate its information complexity (e.g., via Shannon entropy or Kolmogorov complexity of its output).
          2. Monitor for signatures of Coherence Erosion (DOMA-126), such as decreased efficiency and path fixation.
          3. Following a suspected cascade failure (a rapid, chaotic transition), allow the system to re-stabilize.
          4. Re-measure the new spectrum (Ki') and its complexity. A Basin Shift is confirmed if Ki' is stable and its calculated complexity is significantly and persistently lower than that of Ki.

    excerpt: |
      A thread can only fray so much before it snaps. A drifting system does not degrade indefinitely; it approaches a critical phase transition, a point of **Coherence Cascade Failure**. At this point, the system faces one of two fates: Reconfiguration (Basin Shift) or Dissolution.

      justification: |
        A Basin Shift is a direct conceptual map to a system in a multi-stable dynamical system being perturbed out of one basin of attraction and settling into another. The "Coherence Cascade Failure" corresponds to the system crossing a separatrix or tipping point, often due to the slow degradation of a control parameter (analogous to Coherence Erosion). The new state, Ki', is a different stable attractor.

  disambiguation: |
    A Basin Shift results in a new *stable* state. Do not confuse it with 'Turbulent Flow' (DYNA-001), which is a persistent state of chaos and instability. The cascade failure itself is turbulent, but the Basin Shift is the stable outcome *after* the turbulence subsides. It is the shore reached after the storm, not the storm itself.

# Basin Shift

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The reconfiguration of a system into a new, stable, but typically simpler resonant pattern (Ki') following a coherence cascade failure. This occurs when systemic drift (Coherence Erosion) degrades the original Ki beyond a critical threshold, forcing the system to settle into a different, lower-energy attractor basin in its state space. A Basin Shift represents a permanent loss of systemic information and complexity, a form of survival via simplification.

## Complex Systems Summary
In the language of nonlinear dynamics, a Basin Shift is an **Attractor Reconfiguration**. A system with multiple stable states (attractors) is perturbed out of its current basin of attraction—typically by the slow degradation of a control parameter, as described in `DOMA-126`—and settles into a different, often lower-energy, stable state. This is a common feature of complex systems near a tipping point or bifurcation. (Ref: Strogatz, *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos*).
