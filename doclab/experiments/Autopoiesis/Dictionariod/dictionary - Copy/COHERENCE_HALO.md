    Around every island of social peace lies a silent, decaying corona of its contained disagreements. This is the geometric shadow cast by stability, a ghostly pressure gradient holding chaos at bay. The halo is the hum of managed tension at the edge of town.
  law: |
    The magnitude of the Social Dissonance Field ( $|\mathbf{D}|$ ) decays as an inverse power-law with distance ($|\mathbf{D}| \propto r^{-1}$) from the boundary of a stable societal core ($r_c$). Deviations from this scaling law signal either systemic decay or the absorption of a new sub-system.
  philosophy: |
    A system's health is not measured by the absence of dissonance, but by its ability to structure it geometrically. The Coherence Halo demonstrates that stability is not a uniform state but a dynamic equilibrium defined by a core and its structured periphery. It is the architectural proof that functional societies actively manage, rather than eliminate, tension.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Coherence Halo is the predicted spatial region surrounding a stable societal core where the magnitude of the Social Dissonance Field ($|\mathbf{D}|$) decays as a stable, inverse power-law with distance ($r$). It represents the geometric boundary where the system's internal coherence transitions to the ambient noise of its environment. The halo's geometry‚Äîits radius ($r_c$) and decay exponent‚Äîquantifies the system's capacity to absorb and structure external pressures.

        outline: |
          1. Construct a weighted, directed graph of social interactions (e.g., communication, trade, mobility).
          2. Compute the observed interaction flow ($\mathbf{J}_{obs}$) and the coherence-optimal flow ($\mathbf{J}_{opt}$) derived from the system's Pirouette Lagrangian.
          3. Calculate the residual flow field $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{J}_{obs} - \mathbf{J}_{opt}$.
          4. Apply a Hodge decomposition to $\mathbf{r}$ to isolate the curl-free and divergence-free components, which constitute the Dissonance Field $\mathbf{D}$.
          5. Plot the field magnitude $|\mathbf{D}|$ as a function of distance $r$ from the identified system core.
          6. Perform a power-law fit to the data for $r > r_c$ to test the $r^{-1}$ hypothesis.

      Policy optimization test: Place interventions at $r \approx r_c$ to minimize coherence residue per unit resource.

      justification: |
        Both concepts describe a non-luminous, power-law-decaying field or substance that surrounds a stable central object (a society's core vs. a galaxy) and governs its large-scale stability and dynamics. The Coherence Halo's dissonance field creates a "potential well" that contains social dynamics, analogous to the gravitational well of a dark matter halo that binds stars and gas. The predicted $r^{-1}$ scaling is a simpler, falsifiable alternative to standard cosmological profiles.

  disambiguation: |
    The Coherence Halo is not a cognitive bias (the "halo effect") but a measurable, geometric structure in a social field. It should also be distinguished from an "echo chamber" or "filter bubble"; these phenomena describe circulatory, curl-dominant dynamics ($‚àá \times \mathbf{A}$) that can occur *within* a halo, but they are not the halo itself, which is defined by the radial decay of the total dissonance magnitude $|\mathbf{D}|$.

# Coherence Halo

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Coherence Halo is the predicted spatial region surrounding a stable societal core where the magnitude of the Social Dissonance Field ($|\mathbf{D}|$) decays as a stable, inverse power-law with distance ($r$). It represents the geometric boundary where the system's internal coherence transitions to the ambient noise of its environment. The halo's geometry‚Äîits radius ($r_c$) and decay exponent‚Äîquantifies the system's capacity to absorb and structure external pressures.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually and mathematically analogous to a Dark Matter Halo in cosmology, the Coherence Halo models the large-scale structure of social instability. Just as a galaxy's dynamics are governed by a surrounding, non-visible mass profile, a society's stability is determined by a surrounding, power-law-decaying field of social dissonance. This dissonance field ($|\mathbf{D}|$) is predicted to scale as $r^{-1}$, providing a distinct and testable signature that diverges from standard cosmological models like the NFW profile, positioning it as a falsifiable claim about the geometry of social physics.
