    The effortless glide of a master skater on perfect ice. Motion becomes a dance, a perfect resonance between the self and the medium, leaving behind a clean and silent wake.
  law: |
    A system is in a state of Laminar Skate when its propulsive efficiency approaches unity. This state is characterized by a coherence loss of less than 1% per stride cycle and a Wound Channel signature that decays to baseline within two stride-lengths.
  philosophy: |
    Laminar Skate represents the highest expression of Geodesic Skating, where motion ceases to be an act of will imposed upon a resistant world. It is the state of perfect partnership, where the skater's internal rhythm harmonizes with the external manifold, demonstrating that the most efficient path is one of resonance, not force.
pirouette_definition: |
  The optimal flow state of Geodesic Skating, characterized by an effortless and efficient motion where the skater's rhythmic modulation of internal coherence (`K_τ`) and external Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) is in perfect resonance with the natural frequencies of the local medium. In this state, propulsive efficiency is maximized, coherence loss is minimized, and the resulting Wound Channel is a clean, rapidly decaying geometric signature.

      justification: |
        Laminar Skate describes motion with minimal energy dissipation, low drag, and a smooth, orderly wake. This is directly analogous to laminar flow in fluid dynamics, where fluid layers slide past each other without significant mixing or turbulence. Both concepts represent the most energy-efficient mode of transport through a medium.

    - target: Superfluidity
      domain: AMO
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        The concept of effortless, dissipationless motion in Laminar Skate mirrors the phenomenon of superfluidity, where a fluid flows with zero viscosity. A skater in this state moves without losing coherence (energy) to the medium, much like a superfluid flows without friction.
      confidence: 0.6
  adopted:
    - target: Laminar flow
      rationale: The terminology is directly borrowed, and the analogy between minimal energy dissipation, orderly flow, and a smooth wake is a 1:1 conceptual mapping.

      falsifier: "Observation of a non-zero, persistent Wound Channel from a system confirmed to be operating at maximum possible propulsive efficiency. This would imply a fundamental 'cost of passage' even in ideal conditions, violating the principle of perfect resonance."

  disambiguation: |
    While directly borrowing from the fluid dynamics concept of laminar flow, Laminar Skate is not restricted to fluid media. It describes a quality of motion through the generalized coherence manifold, applicable to any system capable of Geodesic Skating. The key distinction is between smooth, efficient 'flow' and chaotic, dissipative 'turbulence'.

# Laminar Skate

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The optimal flow state of Geodesic Skating, characterized by an effortless and efficient motion where the skater's rhythmic modulation of internal coherence (`K_τ`) and external Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) is in perfect resonance with the natural frequencies of the local medium. In this state, propulsive efficiency is maximized, coherence loss is minimized, and the resulting Wound Channel is a clean, rapidly decaying geometric signature.

## EFT-First Summary
In analogy with fluid dynamics, a Laminar Skate is a regime of motion with a vanishingly small "drag coefficient," indicating minimal turbulence or energy dissipation. The skater's path follows a geodesic not through spacetime, but on the coherence manifold, and the "laminar" quality signifies that this path is maximally efficient, converting nearly all internal state modulation into directed motion without generating a disruptive wake. This corresponds to a system where the propulsive action generates negligible "friction" or entropy in the surrounding medium.
