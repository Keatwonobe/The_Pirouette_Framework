triad:
  art: |
    The fertile ground between crystal rigidity and storm-tossed chaos, where a single seed of coherence can take root and flourish into a forest.
  law: |
    The maximal increase in systemic coherence (ΔKτ) from a Coherence Offering is achieved when the recipient system exhibits moderate temporal coherence, existing in a state between rigid stability and chaotic turbulence.
  philosophy: |
    The Coherence Gap reframes intervention as a strategic art of cultivation. It asserts that true growth arises not from applying force, but from identifying and nourishing the latent potential for order that already exists, turning a simple act into a resonant catalyst for systemic transformation.
pirouette_definition: |
  The potential within a system to integrate a `Coherence Offering` and achieve a more complex, resilient, and coherent state. The Coherence Gap is the optimal state for `Resonant Reinforcement`, existing in the 'sweet spot' between the rigidity of high-coherence systems (crystals) and the instability of low-coherence systems (storms). A system with a significant Coherence Gap has sufficient internal structure to receive an offering but enough flexibility and creative tension to be transformed by it.

        outline: |
          1.  Acquire time-series data representing a key dynamic of the target system.
          2.  Apply the `Caduceus Lens` (DYNA-003) protocol to calculate the system's Temporal Coherence (Kτ) and its variance (σ²_Kτ).
          3.  The Coherence Gap is identified as a state of moderate Kτ (e.g., 0.4-0.7) combined with non-negligible variance, indicating a system that is structured but not static.
        expected_signals: [Quasi-periodic time-series, "breathing" modes in phase space, power spectra with a dominant peak but significant broadband noise.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking transient noise for systemic creative tension; mischaracterizing the system's core dynamics, leading to an inaccurate Kτ calculation; failing to account for external driving pressures (Γ).]

    excerpt: |
      The most potent synthesis occurs in systems that are neither perfectly stable nor completely chaotic. They possess a "coherence gap"—the potential to achieve a more complex and resilient state. High Coherence (The Crystal): A system... is rigid. It has little room to integrate a new pattern. Low Coherence (The Storm): A system in a state of turbulence lacks the internal structure to receive... the offering. The Sweet Spot (The Soil): The ideal recipient has a stable underlying structure but is experiencing creative tension or pressure.

    excerpt: |
      The second step is a diagnosis of systemic health. Using the principles of the `Caduceus Lens` (DYNA-003), we assess the state of the candidates. The greatest potential for positive change (ΔKτ) lies with those in the "fertile ground"—the sweet spot between rigidity and chaos.

      justification: |
        Near a critical point, a system's susceptibility to external fields diverges, meaning a small perturbation can cause a macroscopic state change. This is analogous to a system with a Coherence Gap being maximally responsive to a Coherence Offering. The "creative tension" is the system's internal fluctuations near criticality.

        The "edge of chaos" is the regime where complex adaptive systems are hypothesized to exhibit maximal adaptability, complexity, and computational power, poised between static order and unpredictable chaos. This provides a direct, well-established conceptual parallel to the Coherence Gap's "sweet spot" between the "crystal" and the "storm," making it the most suitable formal mapping.

      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A large-scale observation shows no correlation between initial Kτ and the efficacy of an intervention, or that the most significant systemic improvements consistently occur in highly ordered or highly chaotic systems."

    The Coherence Gap is not a lack of coherence, but the *potential for increased* coherence. It is an opportunity or receptivity, not a deficit. It denotes the 'gap' between a system's current state and a higher-order, more resilient potential state that has become accessible.

# Coherence Gap

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The potential within a system to integrate a `Coherence Offering` and achieve a more complex, resilient, and coherent state. The Coherence Gap is the optimal state for `Resonant Reinforcement`, existing in the 'sweet spot' between the rigidity of high-coherence systems (crystals) and the instability of low-coherence systems (storms). A system with a significant Coherence Gap has sufficient internal structure to receive an offering but enough flexibility and creative tension to be transformed by it.

## EFT-First Summary
The Coherence Gap is the Pirouette Framework's operationalization of the "edge of chaos" concept from complexity science. Systems poised at this boundary—neither rigidly ordered nor fully chaotic—exhibit maximal adaptability and are most receptive to external inputs that can catalyze a transition to a more complex, stable state. Measurement of the Coherence Gap via the `Caduceus Lens` is a search for systems at this critical threshold, identifying them as prime candidates for effective, resonant intervention.
