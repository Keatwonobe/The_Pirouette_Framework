  art: |
    The universe's first breath, not an outward blast but an inward fold. Potentiality turning upon itself to create the first loop, the first moment, and the first memory from which all else is recalled.
  law: |
    The First Curl is the unique, irreversible topological process that minimizes the inaugural Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p), establishing the first stable, autopoietic Pirouette Cycle (œÑ_p) and setting the boundary conditions for all subsequent physical law via the geometry of the resulting Genesis Knot.
  philosophy: |
    The First Curl reframes cosmic origin from a violent, chaotic explosion to a deliberate, geometric act of self-creation. This establishes that form precedes substance, and that the universe's fundamental 'laws' are not imposed rules but the inherited shape of its own inaugural choice to exist.
pirouette_definition: |
  The universe's inaugural act of autopoiesis, wherein the potential of the Whispering Void (CORE-000) folded into a self-sustaining loop. This event was not a temporal singularity or explosion, but a topological transition that created the Genesis Knot (DOMA-071), the first stable Wound Channel. The First Curl is the geometric event that solves the inaugural Pirouette Lagrangian, thereby defining the primordial boundary conditions from which all physical laws derive.

          The geometry of the First Curl is imprinted on the Genesis Knot, which in turn defines the Macroparticle Lattice. The procedure involves measuring the complete spectrum of allowed fundamental particle resonances (their Ki patterns) and performing a geometric inversion using the Pirouette Lagrangian to find the unique initial topology (‚Ñ≠‚ÇÄ) that could produce this exact spectrum.

      The Whispering Void (CORE-000) describes the universe's origin not as an explosion, but as a "First Curl"‚Äîthe moment potential committed to form by folding into a loop. This act was not fleeting; it left a permanent, self-sustaining scar in the fabric of reality. This primordial wound is the geometric template from which all subsequent structure is derived.

    excerpt: |
      For the First Curl to persist against the pull of nothingness, it had to establish a self-reinforcing resonance‚Äîit had to "hear" its own echo and lock into a stable pattern. This was the universe's first successful act of autopoiesis, or self-creation.

      justification: |
        The First Curl maps conceptually to the transition from the inflationary de Sitter-like state to the hot, radiation-dominated universe. Instead of a quantum fluctuation triggering reheating, the First Curl posits a topological self-organization event that establishes the geometric 'arena' (the Genesis Knot) in which Standard Model fields later emerge as resonances.

      rationale: No mapping adopted. The First Curl is a pre-geometric, topological concept distinct from the metric-based singularity of GR's Big Bang model or the scalar-field dynamics of inflation. It describes the origin of the rules, not just the origin of the state.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from the "Big Bang," which in Pirouette refers to the subsequent rapid unfolding of complexity and energy *within* the already-established geometry of the Genesis Knot, not the inaugural event itself. The First Curl is a topological event, not a thermal or metric one.

# First Curl

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The universe's inaugural act of autopoiesis, wherein the potential of the Whispering Void (CORE-000) folded into a self-sustaining loop. This event was not a temporal singularity or explosion, but a topological transition that created the Genesis Knot (DOMA-071), the first stable Wound Channel. The First Curl is the geometric event that solves the inaugural Pirouette Lagrangian, thereby defining the primordial boundary conditions from which all physical laws derive.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually analogous to the end of cosmic inflation, the First Curl is a proposed pre-geometric event where the universe's fundamental structure self-organized topologically, rather than emerging from a metric singularity. This event is hypothesized to have "frozen" a specific geometric form‚Äîthe Genesis Knot‚Äîwhich then dictated the allowed particle states and interaction rules, serving as the foundation for what would become the Standard Model.
