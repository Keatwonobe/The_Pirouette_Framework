        -   **Mode Hopping:** A sudden shift where one set of harmonic peaks fades and another emerges is the definitive sign of a **phase transition**. The system has been forced to find a new, more stable `Ki` to better survive its environment.

  art: |
    A system, under duress, changes its song. The old melody dies, and in the silence, a new one is born, tuned to a harsher reality.
  law: |
    On a Coherence Spectrum, the integral of coherence (`KœÑ`) over a frequency band (`Œîœâ‚ÇÅ`) associated with an initial resonant mode (`Ki‚ÇÅ`) must decrease below a noise threshold while the integral of `KœÑ` over a new band (`Œîœâ‚ÇÇ`) for a final mode (`Ki‚ÇÇ`) must rise above it within a defined transition time (`Œît`).
  philosophy: |
    Mode Hopping reveals that stability is not static but adaptive. It is the visible evidence of a system's search for a new resonant state‚Äîa new identity‚Äîin response to overwhelming environmental pressure, demonstrating that survival is an act of creative re-tuning.
pirouette_definition: |
  A diagnostic pattern observed in a Coherence Spectrum, characterized by the rapid decay of a system's dominant set of harmonic peaks (its `Ki` pattern) and the concurrent emergence of a new, distinct set of peaks at different frequencies. This event is the canonical signature of a phase transition, indicating the system has abandoned one resonant state for another in order to maximize its Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`) under changed environmental conditions or internal stress.

        outline: |
          1. Generate a continuous Coherence Spectrum (`KœÑ(œâ, t)`) for the system under observation using the Harmonic Lens protocol.
          2. Identify the initial dominant harmonic peaks corresponding to mode `Ki‚ÇÅ`.
          3. Track the peak amplitudes over time.
          4. Detect a point where the amplitude of `Ki‚ÇÅ` peaks falls below a signal-to-noise threshold.
          5. Simultaneously, scan for the rise of a new, stable set of harmonic peaks (`Ki‚ÇÇ`) above the threshold.
          6. The interval between the decay of `Ki‚ÇÅ` and the stabilization of `Ki‚ÇÇ` defines the mode hop.

    excerpt: |
      The Coherence Spectrum is a rich diagnostic document that maps directly to a system's health... **Flickering or Fading Bands:** A primary `Ki` pattern that wavers in intensity or fades over time is a visual marker of **Coherence Erosion**, indicating the system is struggling to maintain its form against entropic pressure. **Mode Hopping:** A sudden shift where one set of harmonic peaks fades and another emerges is the definitive sign of a **phase transition**.

      justification: |
        In laser physics, mode hopping is a discrete jump in the laser's output frequency to a different resonant mode of its optical cavity, often due to thermal drift. The Pirouette term generalizes this concept from an optical to any complex system, treating the jump as a diagnostic signal of a state change driven by pressure.

      mapping_kind: conceptual|operational
      rationale: |
        This is the most direct and broadly applicable mapping. In complex systems theory, a tipping point or regime shift is a critical threshold where a system rapidly shifts from one stable state to another. Mode Hopping is the direct, observable signature of this event on a Coherence Spectrum, making the abstract concept of a tipping point a measurable phenomenon.

constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "Every true phase transition or regime shift within a system is accompanied by a measurable Mode Hopping event in its Coherence Spectrum."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Observing a system undergo a well-established phase transition (e.g., a superconducting transition, a market crash) without a corresponding decay of old harmonic peaks and emergence of new ones in its temporal signature. This would imply the Coherence Spectrum is an incomplete diagnostic tool for fundamental state changes."

  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette, Mode Hopping is a generalized diagnostic pattern observable in any system's Coherence Spectrum, signifying a fundamental state change. This is distinct from the more specific term in laser physics, which refers to the physical event of a laser jumping between resonant optical modes. The Pirouette term emphasizes the universal *informational signature* of the change.
