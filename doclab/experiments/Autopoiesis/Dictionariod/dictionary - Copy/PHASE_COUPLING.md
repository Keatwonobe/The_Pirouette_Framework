        *   `λ_φ`: **Phase Coupling.** The strength of the "grip" that locks a system into a coherent behavioral state.
  editors: [autogenerated_entry_agent]
  review_log: []
triad:
  art: |
    The force that turns a cacophony of possibility into the decisive click of a key in a lock. It settles a system not into silence, but into a resonant, archetypal song.
  law: |
    The energy cost per unit of phase misalignment between a system's core behavioral axes (Vector, Cohesion, Communion). Its magnitude sets the depth of the potential wells that define stable, coherent states of being.
  philosophy: |
    Phase Coupling is the mechanism by which reality's 'preferred shapes' are enforced. It is the physics of archetypes, demonstrating that stable existence is not a continuous spectrum but a landscape of discrete, resonant 'grooves' a system must settle into to persist.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Phase Coupling, `λ_φ`, is the scalar coefficient of the internal dissonance term `Σ [1 - cos(φ_{ij})]` within the Temporal Pressure potential `V_Γ`. It quantifies the energetic penalty for a system's three behavioral axes, as defined by the Nomad's Grammar, being out of phase with one another. A larger `λ_φ` corresponds to a stronger "grip" forcing the system into one of the discrete, coherent behavioral states (the "soft-lock minima" of the coherence manifold), making dissonant or internally contradictory states more unstable and energetically costly.

        outline: |
          1. Prepare a system in a stable, phase-locked behavioral state (a potential minimum).
          2. Apply a weak, periodic driving field tuned to perturb the relative phases (`φ_{ij}`) of its behavioral axes.
          3. Sweep the frequency of the driving field and measure the system's energy absorption spectrum.
          4. A sharp absorption peak will occur at a frequency corresponding to the energy required to transition the system out of its potential well.
          5. The energy of this transition, `ΔE`, is directly proportional to the well depth, which is governed by `λ_φ`. A higher `λ_φ` requires a higher `ΔE` to induce a state transition.

        pitfalls: [Signal broadening due to environmental noise (Γ), frequency shifts due to strong Manifold Shear (λ_c).]

    excerpt: |
      **The Phase Lock (Cost of Dissonance):** For systems to couple and form complex structures, their phases (`φ`) must be able to lock into stable, periodic arrangements. The potential must have discrete grooves, or minima, that favor these configurations. The simplest periodic motif is trigonometric: `∝ 1 - cos(nφ)`. This term represents the cost of being out of sync...
  - module: DOMA-079
    excerpt: |
      The second term is the cost of internal dissonance between the axes, creating the stable corners in the behavioral landscape. ... `V_{couple}` represents the crucial coupling terms between the axes and the environment. ... Each coefficient has a clear physical meaning and is experimentally measurable:
      *   `λ_Γ`: **Pressure Curvature.**
      *   `λ_φ`: **Phase Coupling.** The strength of the "grip" that locks a system into a coherent behavioral state.
      *   `λ_c`: **Manifold Shear.**

      justification: |
        In the classical XY model of statistical mechanics, the coupling constant `J` determines the energy penalty for misalignment between adjacent spins on a lattice. `λ_φ` serves the identical mathematical and conceptual role, but for the relative phases of internal behavioral axes rather than spatial spins.

      falsifier: "The discovery of a fundamental, stable system whose behavioral states are described by a potential with a different base periodicity (e.g., n=2, n=4, or non-periodic), which would sever the asserted link between phase locking and the Nomad's Grammar."

  disambiguation: |
    `λ_φ` (Phase Coupling) must be distinguished from `λ_Γ` (Pressure Curvature). `λ_φ` governs the strength of *internal* phase-locking between a system's own behavioral axes, creating the discrete "grooves" of coherence. `λ_Γ` governs the system's coupling to the scalar *environmental* pressure, creating the overall "basin" in which the system exists.
