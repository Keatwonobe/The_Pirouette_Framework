    The number of temporal-color threads a particle carries. One or two threads feel the tug of the knotted medium, while zero or three pass freely through the weave.
  law: |
    A representation `R` of SU(3) has N-ality `k` if its holonomy transforms as `U → e^(2πik/3) U` under a Z₃ center transformation. Sources with `k ≠ 0 (mod 3)` are confined and exhibit an area law for their Wilson loop, with a string tension `σ_k` that depends only on `k`.
  philosophy: |
    N-ality is the fundamental quantum number determining confinement in the temporal-color frame. It elevates a mathematical property of SU(3) representations into a physical charge, providing the criterion for which particles are bound by the condensed Z₃ vortex medium and which can exist as asymptotic states.
pirouette_definition: |
  N-ality is the integer charge, `k mod 3`, of a state or representation under the Z₃ center symmetry of the SU(3) temporal-color frame. This charge determines the state's interaction with the condensed Z₃ vortex medium. States with non-zero N-ality (`k=1, 2`) are confined by flux tubes with a string tension `σ_k`, while states with zero N-ality (`k=0`) are not confined and can be screened by the vacuum.

        outline: |
          On a Euclidean spacetime lattice, compute the vacuum expectation value of large, planar Wilson loops `<W_R(C)>` for a static source in representation `R`. Fit the result to `A * exp(-σ_R * Area(C)) + B * exp(-β * Perimeter(C))`. A non-zero value for the string tension `σ_R` indicates confinement and thus non-zero N-ality.
        expected_signals:
          - Area-law decay (`<W_R(C)> ~ exp(-σ_R * Area)`) for representations with `k=1, 2`.
          - Perimeter-law decay (`<W_R(C)> ~ exp(-β * Perimeter)`) for representations with `k=0`.
        pitfalls:
          - String breaking at large distances if dynamical quarks are included.
          - Finite volume effects and lattice spacing artifacts.
          - Statistical noise requiring large ensembles.

        For a center element `z = e^(2πi/3) * I`, a representation `R(z)` acts as `e^(2πik/3) * R(I)`. The integer `k mod 3` is the triality.
      justification: |
        N-ality in the Pirouette Framework for SU(3) is identical to the concept of triality in standard Quantum Chromodynamics. It is the integer `k mod 3` that characterizes how a representation transforms under the Z₃ center of the SU(3) gauge group. Operationally, it determines whether a state's color charge can be screened by gluons (`k=0`) or if it must be confined (`k≠0`).

  disambiguation: |
    For the gauge group SU(N), the general concept is N-ality, a charge under the Zₙ center. In the specific context of QCD's SU(3) gauge group, it is commonly called 'triality'. Pirouette uses the term 'N-ality' to maintain consistency with the general theory, but it is synonymous with triality for SU(3).

# N-ality

## Canonical (Pirouette)
N-ality is the integer charge, `k mod 3`, of a state or representation under the Z₃ center symmetry of the SU(3) temporal-color frame. This charge determines the state's interaction with the condensed Z₃ vortex medium. States with non-zero N-ality (`k=1, 2`) are confined by flux tubes with a string tension `σ_k`, while states with zero N-ality (`k=0`) are not confined and can be screened by the vacuum.

## EFT-First Summary
N-ality is the Pirouette Framework's realization of **triality** from standard Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). It is the conserved quantum number associated with the Z₃ center symmetry of the SU(3) gauge group. Any particle or state carrying a net triality charge of `k=1` (like a quark) or `k=2` (like an anti-quark) cannot exist as a free particle and is confined. Only states with zero net triality (`k=0 mod 3`), such as mesons (quark-antiquark) and baryons (three quarks), can be observed as asymptotic states.
