  law: |
    At the matching scale μ ~ ω_c, the low-energy QED Lagrangian is augmented with a finite series of ω_c-suppressed, gauge-invariant higher-derivative operators. The dimensionless coefficients `c_i` of these operators are O(1) and determined by the microphysics of the Γ-sector, ensuring all would-be quadratic divergences are absorbed.
  philosophy: |
    To guarantee a consistent and predictive transition from the familiar world of QED to the time-first regime without invoking fine-tuning. Barrier matching replaces the problem of infinities with a problem of calculable, finite resonances at the coherence barrier.

        Barrier matching is a specific application of the standard EFT matching procedure, where heavy degrees of freedom (here, Γ-fluctuations near ω_c) are integrated out. This generates higher-dimension operators (`O_i`) suppressed by the heavy scale (ω_c). The key distinction in Pirouette is the claim that this procedure is finite and resolves quadratic divergences that would otherwise require fine-tuning.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike standard EFT matching which may simply shift the burden of infinities or fine-tuning to a UV theory, Pirouette's barrier matching is a physical mechanism. It posits that the counterterms are *finite* and calculable, representing the resonant response of the Γ-field at ω_c that physically absorbs the high-energy behavior.

# Barrier matching

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The procedure for ensuring a smooth, predictive transition between the low-energy effective theory (QED) and the high-energy, time-first theory. It is implemented at the coherence barrier scale μ ~ ω_c by adding a specific, finite set of gauge-invariant counterterms (higher-derivative operators) to the Lagrangian. These terms, suppressed by powers of ω_c, absorb the would-be quadratic divergences of QED, rendering the connection between the two theories finite and calculable.

## EFT-First Summary
Barrier matching is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to standard Effective Field Theory (EFT) matching. At an energy scale μ ~ ω_c (the coherence barrier), the effects of high-energy "time-first" dynamics are systematically captured in the low-energy QED theory by a series of higher-dimension operators suppressed by powers of ω_c. Unlike conventional approaches that might require infinite counterterms to handle divergences, barrier matching claims that the added operators have finite, O(1) coefficients that are physically determined by the resonant dynamics at the barrier, thereby resolving the hierarchy problem in this sector.
