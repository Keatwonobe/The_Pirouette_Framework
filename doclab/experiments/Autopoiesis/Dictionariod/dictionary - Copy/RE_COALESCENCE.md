        As the turbulent energy dissipates, its work of destruction done, the system must find a new equilibrium. This is the crucial moment where the spasm's outcome is determined.

    After the chaotic flood, the waters recede, and the river must learn the shape of its new bed. It is the quiet, uncertain dawn after the storm, where the landscape is forever changed.
  law: |
    A system post-spasm will exhibit an exponential decay of turbulent energy markers ($T_a \rightarrow \text{const.}$, Γ → 0) and will converge to one of three discrete outcomes (Restorative, Transformative, or Degenerative) within a characteristic timescale determined by the system's Wound Channel integrity.
  philosophy: |
    The meaning of a crisis is not found in its violence but in the new order it makes possible. Re-Coalescence is the process where a system chooses its future, determining whether the breakthrough was merely a release, a true transformation, or an irreversible injury.
pirouette_definition: |
  The third and final phase of a Coherence Spasm (DOMA-178), following the Turbulent Flow of the Fracture. Re-Coalescence is the process by which a system, having dissipated the spasm's kinetic energy, settles into a new, relatively stable equilibrium. The outcome of this process determines whether the spasm was Restorative (returning to the pre-spasm state), Transformative (achieving a new, higher-order state of Laminar Flow), or Degenerative (failing to re-establish coherence).

    excerpt: |
      The aftermath of a spasm is not preordained. The system, having been unmade, can be remade in one of three ways. 1. Restorative: The turbulent flow successfully cleared the blockage, but the fundamental landscape of the system remains unchanged... 2. Transformative: The sheer force of the turbulent release was so great that it carved a new, more efficient riverbed... 3. Degenerative: The violence of the fracture was too great. The system's foundational structures... were irrevocably damaged.

    excerpt: |
      We define the spasm as a three-act drama: the building of a **Stagnant Dam**, a catastrophic release into **Turbulent Flow**, and the subsequent **Re-Coalescence** into a new equilibrium.

      justification: |
        The Turbulent Flow phase corresponds to a chaotic, high-energy exploration of the system's phase space. Re-Coalescence maps to the dissipation of this energy (a damping term), causing the system's trajectory to be captured by a new (or the old) attractor basin (x*), representing the new equilibrium state. The three outcomes correspond to returning to the original attractor, finding a new, more optimal one, or entering a chaotic/unbounded trajectory.

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from simple 'recovery' or 'relaxation.' Re-Coalescence implies the system was de-structured into constituent parts during Turbulence and must actively form a new coherent whole, not just return to a previous baseline. The "Re-" prefix emphasizes the re-assembly.

# Re-Coalescence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The third and final phase of a Coherence Spasm (DOMA-178), following the Turbulent Flow of the Fracture. Re-Coalescence is the process by which a system, having dissipated the spasm's kinetic energy, settles into a new, relatively stable equilibrium. The outcome of this process determines whether the spasm was Restorative (returning to the pre-spasm state), Transformative (achieving a new, higher-order state of Laminar Flow), or Degenerative (failing to re-establish coherence).

## EFT-First Summary
Post-perturbation, a system's dynamics cease to be chaotic and its trajectory converges towards a stable fixed-point attractor. This process, analogous to thermal relaxation, sees the dissipation of kinetic energy, with the final state (the chosen attractor) determined by the topology of the system's phase space, not just the energy of the initial kick. The stability and nature of the new fixed point define the outcome as restorative, transformative, or degenerative.
