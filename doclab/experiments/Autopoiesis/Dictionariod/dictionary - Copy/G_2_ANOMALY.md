    An electron's subtle self-embrace; its magnetic moment is slightly shifted by the echo of its own passage through the coherence manifold.
  law: |
    The anomalous magnetic moment of the electron (a_e) is the ratio of the fine-structure constant (α) to 2π, representing the first-order correction from self-interaction over a single phase cycle of the Coherence Echo.
  philosophy: |
    This constant is not an ad-hoc parameter but a direct geometric consequence of self-interaction, serving as the primary validation test that grounds the framework's abstract machinery in the most precise measurement in physics.

  The anomalous magnetic moment of the electron (a_e) is a dimensionless constant representing the first-order correction to the electron's g-factor from its baseline value of 2. It arises from the electron's self-interaction with its own "wake," or Coherence Echo, in the background coherence manifold. This interaction perturbs the electron's geodesic, introducing a geometric correction factor of 1/(2π) modulated by the fine-structure constant (α), which represents the interaction strength.

          1. Model the electron's Coherence Echo as a perturbation to the coherence manifold with a strength proportional to the fine-structure constant, α.
          2. Calculate the perturbed geodesic of the electron's resonance on this deformed manifold using the methods of MATH-005.
          3. Integrate the interaction over a single phase cycle of the echo, which yields a fundamental geometric factor of 1/(2π).
          4. The anomaly a_e is the product of the interaction strength and the geometric factor: a_e = α / (2π).

    excerpt: |
      The framework's most critical test is to reproduce the most precise prediction in physics. MATH-002 proved that the baseline g=2 is a geometric necessity. Now, we outline the calculation of the anomaly a_e = (g-2)/2. The anomaly arises from the electron's self-interaction—its resonance interacting with its own "wake" or "echo" in the coherence manifold, as described in CORE-009.

    excerpt: |
      The geometry of a single-cycle echo introduces a fundamental geometric factor of 1/(2*pi). This is not a "fudge factor" but a direct consequence of integrating the interaction over a single cycle of the echo's phase. The result: The first-order correction to the magnetic moment, a_e, is therefore the product of the interaction strength and the geometric factor: a_e = alpha / (2*pi).

        The Pirouette derivation a_e = α/(2π) exactly reproduces the first-order Schwinger term in the QED perturbation series. This mapping is adopted as the primary bridge between the framework's geometric self-interaction model and Standard Model quantum electrodynamics. The Pirouette model interprets the virtual photon loop as a geometric 'Coherence Echo'.

# g-2 Anomaly

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The anomalous magnetic moment of the electron (a_e) is a dimensionless constant representing the first-order correction to the electron's g-factor from its baseline value of 2. It arises from the electron's self-interaction with its own "wake," or Coherence Echo, in the background coherence manifold. This interaction perturbs the electron's geodesic, introducing a geometric correction factor of 1/(2π) modulated by the fine-structure constant (α), which represents the interaction strength.

## EFT-First Summary
The g-2 Anomaly (a_e) is the deviation of the electron's gyromagnetic ratio from 2. The Pirouette Framework derives the leading-order contribution to this anomaly, a_e = α/(2π), which perfectly matches the one-loop QED calculation first performed by Schwinger [Phys. Rev. 73, 416 (1948)]. This value represents the interaction of the electron with its own virtual photon field, which Pirouette models as a geometric 'Coherence Echo'.
