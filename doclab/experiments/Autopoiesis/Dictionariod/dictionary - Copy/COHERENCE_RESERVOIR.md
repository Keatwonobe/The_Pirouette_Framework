      snippet: |
        The pre-condition for a Cascade is the formation of a **Coherence Reservoir**. This is a system that has achieved a state of very high internal coherence (Kτ) but is trapped in a local optimum on the coherence manifold. Diagnosed as a state of **Coherence Atrophy** or **Stagnant Flow** (DYNA-003), it is a system of immense potential energy confined by a steep gradient in the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) that acts as a "potential well" or a **Coherence Dam**. It is a coiled spring of possibility.

    A coiled spring of possibility. A held breath before the shattering. It is a state of exquisite tension, a perfection so complete it can only be broken to create something new.
  law: |
    A system exhibits the properties of a Coherence Reservoir when its internal coherence (Kτ) has maximized within a local potential well, and the gradient of Temporal Pressure (Γ), the Coherence Dam, is sufficient to prevent transition to a more globally optimal state. The potential for a Generative Cascade is proportional to the difference between the local and global coherence maxima.
  philosophy: |
    Stasis is the womb of violent creation. A Coherence Reservoir demonstrates that true novelty is not an incremental step but a phase transition, born from the accumulated pressure of a system that has exhausted all options within its current ruleset. It teaches that the price of profound growth is often the destruction of a prior, limited perfection.
pirouette_definition: |
  A pre-cascade system state characterized by high internal coherence (Kτ) and significant potential energy, trapped in a local optimum on the coherence manifold. This stasis is maintained by a "Coherence Dam"—a steep, confining gradient in local Temporal Pressure (Γ)—which prevents the system from exploring adjacent, more globally optimal states until a Constraint Shattering Event occurs.

          1. Monitor the system's internal coherence (Kτ) over time.
          2. Simultaneously monitor the internal and external Temporal Pressure (Γ).
          3. A Coherence Reservoir is indicated when Kτ plateaus at a high, stable value while Γ steadily increases or remains high, indicating trapped potential. The system ceases to find local improvements.

      justification: |
        A false vacuum is a metastable local minimum of a scalar field's potential energy. The system is stable but holds immense potential energy that can be released in a phase transition (vacuum decay) to the true vacuum state. This strongly parallels the Coherence Reservoir's role as a trapped, high-potential precursor to a Cascade, with the pre-inflationary singularity cited as a direct example.

      justification: |
        A Coherence Reservoir is a system in a metastable equilibrium. It resides in a local energy minimum, separated from a more stable global minimum by an energy barrier (the Coherence Dam). A sufficient perturbation (a Rupture) can overcome this barrier, causing a transition to the lower energy state and releasing the stored potential.

    - target: False Vacuum
      rationale: The direct use of the pre-inflationary singularity as a prime example in DOMA-058 makes this mapping the most fitting and evocative of the scale intended by the Pirouette Framework.

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike a simple energy reservoir (e.g., a battery), a Coherence Reservoir is defined by its *structure* and *tension*. The energy is stored as high internal coherence trapped in a specific, suboptimal configuration. The key is not the amount of potential, but its imprisonment by a Coherence Dam.

# Coherence Reservoir

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A pre-cascade system state characterized by high internal coherence (Kτ) and significant potential energy, trapped in a local optimum on the coherence manifold. This stasis is maintained by a "Coherence Dam"—a steep, confining gradient in local Temporal Pressure (Γ)—which prevents the system from exploring adjacent, more globally optimal states until a Constraint Shattering Event occurs.

## EFT-First Summary
Conceptually, a Coherence Reservoir is homologous to a **false vacuum** state in quantum field theory. It represents a metastable local minimum of potential energy, where a system is stable but possesses enormous stored energy relative to the true vacuum (global optimum). A Generative Cascade is analogous to the vacuum decay event, a phase transition that releases this potential, as exemplified by cosmological inflation originating from a pre-inflationary singularity.
