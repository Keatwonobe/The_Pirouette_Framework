    When quarks hum together within a baryon, their shared rhythm cancels the loudest parts of their song. Only a faint overtone—the Γ whisper—escapes, subtly altering the hadron's magnetic tune. The hadron is thus a silenced drum in the orchestra of time.
  law: |
    The Γ-mediated correction to a baryon's magnetic anomaly, Δa_B, is a positive definite term scaling with the square of the baryon-to-pressuron mass ratio, (M_B/m_Γ)². Its amplitude is suppressed by a QCD coherence factor (η_B ≪ 1). An observed baryonic anomaly > 10⁻⁹ would falsify the coherence-screening assumption.
  philosophy: |
    This correction bridges the elementary Γ-lepton interaction with the emergent dynamics of composite matter. Its predicted smallness demonstrates the framework's consistency with precision QED/QCD data, while its specific mass-scaling signature offers a new, falsifiable target for next-generation experiments probing nucleon structure.
pirouette_definition: |
  The predicted additive correction (Δa_B) to a baryon's magnetic anomaly (g-2), arising from the coupling of the Γ-field to the temporal density of its constituent quarks. The effect is heavily suppressed by gluon coherence effects within the baryon, encapsulated by a screening factor η_B, making it a small but non-zero perturbative term proportional to (M_B/m_Γ)².

        outline: |
          Measure the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) of a proton or neutron to a precision of 1 part in 10¹⁰ or better. Compare the result with the Standard Model prediction, which includes QED and QCD contributions. A residual difference matching the (M_B/m_Γ)² scaling law would constitute evidence for Δa_B.

          Search for tiny parity-odd asymmetries in polarized muon-proton or electron-proton scattering experiments, specifically at momentum transfers near Q² ≈ m_Γ². The Γ-mediated interaction introduces a spin-dependent term that would otherwise be absent.

      Using ( m_\Gamma = 17~\mathrm{MeV}/c^2 ) and ( g_\Gamma \approx 0.1 ), Pirouette predicts a proton correction ( \Delta a_p \sim 10^{-10} ), which is below current (10^{-8}) experimental precision. This means there is no measurable conflict with existing nucleon data, but a detectable imprint if precision reaches parts-per-billion on magnetic-moment ratios.
  - module: MATH-Γ-003
    excerpt: |
      Inside a baryon, Γ excitation manifests as a beat pattern between quark temporal phases. The coherence gradient of these beats defines ( \eta_B ). When baryons interact coherently (as in dense matter), Γ coupling enhances proportionally to local phase alignment, providing a natural link to nuclear binding corrections.

        In Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), new physics contributions to particle magnetic moments are parametrized by higher-dimension operators. Δa_B is a specific, model-dependent calculation for the Wilson coefficient 'C_B' of such an operator, arising from integrating out the Pressuron (Γ) at low energies.

    Δa_B refers specifically to the baryonic correction predicted by the Pirouette Framework due to Γ-field coupling. It should be distinguished from the well-known muon anomalous magnetic moment (Δa_μ), and from standard QED or QCD loop corrections to baryon magnetic moments.

# Magnetic-Moment Correction

## Pirouette Definition
The predicted additive correction (Δa_B) to a baryon's magnetic anomaly (g-2), arising from the coupling of the Γ-field to the temporal density of its constituent quarks. The effect is heavily suppressed by gluon coherence effects within the baryon, encapsulated by a screening factor η_B, making it a small but non-zero perturbative term proportional to (M_B/m_Γ)².

## EFT-First Summary
In the language of effective field theory, the Magnetic-Moment Correction is a specific 'Beyond the Standard Model' (BSM) contribution to the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of baryons. It corresponds to integrating out a new light scalar (the Pressuron) that couples to quark temporal density. The resulting low-energy operator is heavily suppressed, predicting a deviation from the Standard Model value for the proton's g-2 on the order of 10⁻¹⁰, which is currently below experimental sensitivity but within reach of future experiments.
