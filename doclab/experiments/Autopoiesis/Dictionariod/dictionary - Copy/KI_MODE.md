    Generations are not coincidences but octaves in the song of time. The electron, muon, and tau are the first three notes of a chord struck upon the temporal field, and the Ki-mode is the shape of each note's vibration.
  law: |
    The effective mass `m_n` of a fermion of generation `n` is proportional to the square of its harmonic index, `m_n ∝ n²`, with small logarithmic corrections from Higgs (`ε_n`) and color-coherence (`C_f`) couplings. Mixing angles between generations `i` and `j` are inversely proportional to the separation of their harmonic indices, `θ_ij ∝ 1/|n_i-n_j|`.
  philosophy: |
    Ki-modes replace the arbitrary Yukawa couplings of the Standard Model with a deterministic, geometric principle of temporal resonance. This explains why three stable fermion generations exist and why their masses are hierarchically spaced, treating flavor not as a label but as a consequence of quantized temporal dynamics.
pirouette_definition: |
  A Ki-mode, denoted `ψ_n(t)`, is the intrinsic temporal eigenfunction of a fermion, representing a quantized harmonic mode of temporal resonance. As a solution to the temporal Helmholtz equation `d²ψ/dt² + ω_n²ψ = 0` with `ω_n = nω₁` (for `n=1,2,3`), its overlap integral with the global Γ-field determines the fermion's mass. Its overlap with other Ki-modes determines inter-generational mixing angles.

          The Ki-mode itself is not directly observable. Its properties are inferred by measuring the masses of the charged leptons (electron, muon, tau). The ratios of these masses are then compared against the model's prediction, `m_n/m_1 ≈ n²(1+ε_n)`. A close fit validates the harmonic structure of the underlying Ki-modes.

    excerpt: |
      Mixing between generations arises from **beating** between nearby temporal harmonics: [θ_ij ∝ ∫ dt, ψ_i(t)ψ_j(t) ~ 1/|n_i-n_j|.] Thus, large mixing (ν sector) corresponds to near-degenerate harmonics (slow beat), while small mixing (quarks) reflects widely spaced harmonics (fast beat average → 0).

# Ki-mode

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A Ki-mode, denoted `ψ_n(t)`, is the intrinsic temporal eigenfunction of a fermion, representing a quantized harmonic mode of temporal resonance. As a solution to the temporal Helmholtz equation `d²ψ/dt² + ω_n²ψ = 0` with `ω_n = nω₁` (for `n=1,2,3`), its overlap integral with the global Γ-field determines the fermion's mass. Its overlap with other Ki-modes determines inter-generational mixing angles.

## EFT-First Summary
In the Standard Model, fermion masses are set by arbitrary Yukawa couplings (`Y_f`). The Ki-mode replaces this construct with a physical mechanism: `ψ_n(t)` is a temporal standing wave whose harmonic index `n` dictates the generation (flavor). This framework predicts that the mass scales as `m_n ∝ n²`, effectively deriving the Yukawa couplings from a first-principle resonance condition and thereby explaining the observed mass hierarchy.
