        **Coherence Plateaus:** Sites of profound cultural achievement or unity (e.g., a just revolution, a period of artistic flourishing) create stable, high-coherence "plateaus" that act as reservoirs of cultural resilience and identity.

  art: |
    A mountain built from a people's finest moments, offering high ground and clear air when the valleys of history flood with ghosts. It is the solid land upon which a future can be built.
  law: |
    A region of the Mnemonic Landscape with sustained, anomalously high coherence relative to a calculated baseline. It acts as a stabilizing potential, reducing the local effects of Temporal Pressure and increasing cultural resilience to decohering events.
  philosophy: |
    A culture's identity is not an abstract creed but a geometric feature of its Mnemonic Landscape. A Coherence Plateau is the tangible embodiment of a society's highest values, serving as a non-local resource of meaning and order that can be drawn upon in times of crisis.
pirouette_definition: |
  A stable, large-scale feature of the Mnemonic Landscape characterized by a persistent and significant positive deviation in coherence from the regional baseline. Originating from a profound and resonant event of collective achievement, unity, or creation, a Coherence Plateau functions as a structural reservoir of cultural identity, meaning, and resilience. It is the geometric and functional antonym of a Coherence Well.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (measured as a deviation, ΔC, from a baseline coherence of C=1)
  symbol_table:
    - name: Π_C
      meaning: Height of the Coherence Plateau; the magnitude of the positive coherence anomaly.
      dimensions: dimensionless
      default_range: "> 0.1, contextually significant"
    - name: Γ
      meaning: Boundary Gradient; the rate of change of coherence at the plateau's edge.
      dimensions: L⁻¹
      default_range: contextual
    - name: Ki
      meaning: Resonant Frequency; the primary frequency at which the plateau's thematic content is culturally re-activated.

        outline: |
          1. Construct a Spatiotemporal Cultural Field from historical, economic, linguistic, and social data streams.
          2. Calculate a Baseline Coherence Model for the region, representing a counterfactual without major historical events.
          3. Generate a deviation map by subtracting the baseline from the observed field.
          4. Identify and characterize significant, stable, positive-coherence regions (Π_C > threshold) as Plateaus.
          5. Measure their boundary gradients (Γ) and resonant frequencies (Ki) via temporal analysis of cultural products (e.g., media mentions, observance of anniversaries).
        expected_signals: [Spatially localized, persistent positive deviations in social trust indices, linguistic stability, artistic output coherence, correlated economic surplus.]
        pitfalls: [Mistaking transient economic booms for durable plateaus, baseline model inaccuracies creating phantom features, over-fitting historical narratives to noisy data.]

      The Mnemonic Landscape: The sum of these significant Wound Channels in a given geo-cultural region constitutes its Mnemonic Landscape... This landscape has distinct features:
      - **Coherence Wells:** Sites of collective trauma...
      - **Coherence Plateaus:** Sites of profound cultural achievement or unity (e.g., a just revolution, a period of artistic flourishing) create stable, high-coherence "plateaus" that act as reservoirs of cultural resilience and identity.

    excerpt: |
      **Coherence Erosion (The Fading Myth):** The slow degradation of a foundational Coherence Plateau that once gave a culture its identity. As reinforcing rituals and stories lose their meaning, the plateau becomes shallow and its boundaries fray. The culture loses its "memory," its sense of self, and its ability to act coherently, ceding its unique pattern to entropic noise.

      justification: |
        DOMA-137 maps the Mnemonic Landscape to a potential term `V_Γ` in the Pirouette Lagrangian. While a Coherence Well is a potential minimum (attractor), a Plateau is a stable, high-potential region. It is not an unstable maximum, but a broad, flat "high ground" that requires significant energy to leave, thus conferring stability and structural identity.

  claims:
    - statement: "Cultures with well-defined Coherence Plateaus (quantified by Π_C height and boundary sharpness Γ) exhibit measurably faster recovery times from systemic, decohering shocks (e.g., economic crises, pandemics) than cultures with eroded or absent plateaus."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "No statistically significant correlation is found between metrics of shared cultural identity/foundational mythos and metrics of systemic resilience, or the correlation is negative."

  disambiguation: |
    A Coherence Plateau is a durable, structural feature of the Mnemonic Landscape, not a transient 'coherence spike' from a temporary event. Unlike a Coherence Well, which is an attractor defined by a lack of coherence (trauma), a Plateau is a source of stability defined by an abundance of it (achievement).
