        It defines particle binding and confinement as a geometric consequence of entities
        being trapped on self-closing geodesics within stable vortices in the coherence
        manifold.

  art: |
    A prison whose walls are built from the prisoner's own relentless drive to exist. To be bound is to follow a path of perfect coherence that is a closed loop. Every direction of escape is a path toward dissolution.
  law: |
    A system is confined if and only if its coherence-maximizing geodesic is a closed loop. This condition is met in regions where the curl of the Coherence Field is non-zero (`Œ© = ‚àá √ó F_c ‚â† 0`), indicating the presence of a Coherence Vortex.
  philosophy: |
    This reframes binding forces as a geometric necessity rather than an exchange of particles. It posits that the universe's most stable structures are not states of minimal energy, but states of maximally contained, self-reinforcing dynamics‚Äîa perfectly balanced storm.
pirouette_definition: |
  The primary mechanism for all stable, bound states, wherein a system's coherence-maximizing geodesic is a closed loop. This occurs within a Coherence Vortex, a region of the coherence manifold with non-zero torsion (`Œ© = ‚àá √ó F_c ‚â† 0`). Confinement is not an applied force but a geometric condition where any path deviating from the closed geodesic leads to catastrophic decoherence, trapping the system by its own drive to persist.
operational_definition:
  units: The confinement condition itself is dimensionless (a binary state). The associated torsional intensity field, `|Œ©|`, has units derived from the Temporal Pressure term `V_Œì` of the Lagrangian, typically `[Action] / [Length]^2 / [Time]`.

        outline: |
          1.  Define the system's local coherence manifold using its Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`).
          2.  Compute the Coherence Field `F_c` by taking the negative gradient of the Temporal Pressure term (`-‚àáV_Œì`).
          3.  Compute the torsional intensity field by taking the curl of the Coherence Field (`Œ© = ‚àá √ó F_c`).
          4.  Identify peaks in the resulting scalar field `|Œ©|` as the epicenters of confinement.
        expected_signals: [Spatially localized peaks in `|Œ©|` that correlate with the known locations of stable bound states (e.g., baryons, nuclei).]
        pitfalls: [Numerical instability in curl calculations near sharp field gradients. Misidentification of the correct `V_Œì` term in a complex, multi-body Lagrangian.]

    excerpt: |
      Confinement is revealed not as a force, but as a geometry‚Äîan elegant prison whose walls are built from the prisoner's own relentless drive to exist. This module provides the analytical tools to map these vortices, revealing them as the fundamental mechanism for all stable, bound states.
  - module: DOMA-194
    excerpt: |
      The vortex does not bind particles by overpowering them; it binds them by offering no coherent path of escape. An entity, like a quark, always seeks to follow its geodesic‚Äîthe path of maximal coherence. Within a vortex, this path is a closed loop. To attempt to move radially outward is to fight against the geometric grain of the manifold itself.

  candidates:
    - target: Color Confinement
      domain: SM
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Geometric Confinement provides an alternative mechanism for the phenomenological rule in QCD that quarks and gluons are never observed in isolation. Instead of a color force field that grows with distance, it posits a geometric trap (the Coherence Vortex) from which there is no coherent escape path. This maps the *phenomenon* of confinement to a different underlying cause.
      confidence: 0.5
    - target: Stable Geodesic Orbits (e.g., ISCO)
      domain: GR
      mapping_kind: mathematical
      justification: |
        Both concepts describe stable, bound states as a consequence of entities following a geodesic in a curved geometry. In GR, spacetime is curved by mass-energy, creating closed orbits. In Pirouette, the coherence manifold is "curled" by torsional fields, creating closed geodesics of maximal coherence. The Coherence Vortex is the direct analog of a stable gravitational potential well.

    - statement: "All stable, multi-particle bound states will be located at or within local maxima of the torsional intensity field `|Œ©|` derived from the system's Pirouette Lagrangian."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "The experimental discovery of a stable bound state in a region where the calculated `|Œ©|` is zero or minimal, or conversely, finding a region of high, stable `|Œ©|` that demonstrably contains no bound state."

  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from magnetic confinement (e.g., in tokamaks), which uses external electromagnetic fields to trap a plasma. Geometric Confinement is an intrinsic property of the system's own coherence manifold, emerging from its internal dynamics without external intervention. It is a form of self-confinement.
