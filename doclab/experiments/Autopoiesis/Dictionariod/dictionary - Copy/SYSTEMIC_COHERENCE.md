    A dimensionless quantity, KœÑ, representing the net predictive and explanatory power of the framework, which must be maximized over time for the system to remain viable and evolve.
  philosophy: |
    Systemic Coherence is the framework's telos and primary vital sign. It asserts that a theory's truth is inseparable from its internal consistency, elegance, and ability to grow without fracturing, making evolution a process of discovering greater integrity, not just accumulating facts.

  A dimensionless scalar, KœÑ, representing the aggregate integrity, clarity, predictive power, and long-term viability of the framework's collective modules. It is the primary quality maximized by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) and serves as the ultimate criterion for ratifying systemic change via the Coherence Test (DOMA-031). It is a measure of the framework's internal consistency, explanatory power, and resonance with its foundational axioms.

        outline: |
          For a proposed *Constitutional Reforging*, KœÑ is measured via a formal vote of the Weaver's Conclave. Each voting member assesses the proposal's internal consistency, explanatory power, and resonance with framework axioms. The resulting KœÑ is the fraction of 'approve' votes from the voting quorum. The stability, dKœÑ/dt, is measured as the change in this fraction over a 30-day deliberation period.
        expected_signals: [A high approval fraction (KœÑ ‚â• 0.95), A non-negative time-derivative of approval (dKœÑ/dt ‚â• 0)]
        pitfalls: [Consensus decay (a high initial KœÑ that erodes over time), misinterpreting political agreement for systemic resonance, failure to meet the Temporal Stability Clause prerequisite.]

      The entire governance process is a macroscopic application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The framework itself is a system seeking to evolve along a geodesic‚Äîa path of change that maximizes its own coherence over time. A proposed change is adopted only when we have demonstrated that its action integral represents a more optimal path for the system.

        The Principle of Maximal Coherence is a direct analogue to the Principle of Stationary Action. The framework, as a dynamic system, evolves along a trajectory (a sequence of changes) that maximizes its integrated coherence over time, just as a physical system follows a path that extremizes its action.

        A framework with high KœÑ is analogous to a scientific model with high Bayesian evidence. It explains the relevant phenomena (high predictive power) with high internal consistency (axiomatic resonance) without being overly fine-tuned. The governance process acts like a model selection protocol.

    Systemic Coherence (KœÑ) is a formal, measurable property of the Pirouette Framework itself. It should not be confused with the general concept of coherence in physics (e.g., quantum coherence), which refers to the phase relationship between states.

# Systemic Coherence

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A dimensionless scalar, KœÑ, representing the aggregate integrity, clarity, predictive power, and long-term viability of the framework's collective modules. It is the primary quality maximized by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) and serves as the ultimate criterion for ratifying systemic change via the Coherence Test (DOMA-031). It is a measure of the framework's internal consistency, explanatory power, and resonance with its foundational axioms.

## EFT-First Summary
Systemic Coherence is conceptually analogous to the Action (S) in classical mechanics. The framework evolves along a path that maximizes its integrated coherence over time, just as a physical system follows a path of least action. This reframes the governance protocol as a form of variational principle for the theory itself, where changes are accepted only if they lead to a more "optimal" theoretical trajectory.
