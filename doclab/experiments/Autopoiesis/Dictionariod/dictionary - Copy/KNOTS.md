        What we perceive as particles, atoms, and stars are stable, self-sustaining resonant patterns (Ki) on this manifold. They are knots of coherence, held together by their own internal harmony.

  art: |
    A Knot is a self-tightening whorl in the fabric of spacetime, a stable song whose own harmony holds it together. It is the universe's solution for making something that lasts out of the fleeting substance of Time.
  law: |
    A Knot (K·µ¢) is a system whose configuration maximizes the time-integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (‚à´ùìõ_p dt), forming a localized, self-sustaining region of high internal coherence (K_œÑ) that resists environmental decoherence (V_Œì). The set of all possible Knots corresponds to the set of all stable particles.
  philosophy: |
    Knots are the fundamental mechanism by which 'things' emerge from a seamless whole. They refute a particle-based ontology, proposing instead that existence is not a state of being, but a persistent pattern of activity. The universe is composed not of nouns, but of verbs.
pirouette_definition: |
  A localized, stable, and self-sustaining resonant pattern on the Coherence Manifold. Knots are emergent structures that achieve a dynamic equilibrium by maximizing their internal Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ) against ambient Temporal Pressure (V_Œì). Perceived at different scales, they manifest as fundamental particles, atomic nuclei, stars, or even complex biological and social systems.
operational_definition:
  units: Dimensionless (as an identifier for a pattern type). Properties of a Knot, such as Mass, have standard units.
  symbol_table:
    - name: K·µ¢
      meaning: An individual Knot; an instance of a stable, resonant system.
      dimensions: Dimensionless
      default_range: N/A (identifier)

    procedures:
      - name: Manifold Topography Analysis
        outline: |
          A Knot is not measured directly but is inferred from its geometric effects on the Coherence Manifold.
          1. Propagate a low-coherence probe system through a target region.
          2. Measure deviations in the probe's geodesic (path of maximal coherence).
          3. A Knot is identified by a persistent, localized region of high manifold curvature (gravity/confinement) and gradient (force fields), indicating a stable solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian.

  - module: DOMA-055
    excerpt: |
      What we perceive as forces are the geometric relationships between these knots. They are the tensions, slopes, and curvatures in the fabric of the Loom, arising from the presence of the knots themselves.

  candidates:
    - target: Soliton / Localized Wave Packet
      domain: Math
      mapping_kind: conceptual
      justification: |
        Solitons are self-reinforcing, stable waves that maintain their shape while propagating through a non-linear medium. This is a strong mathematical analogue for a Knot as a stable, propagating pattern emerging from the non-linear dynamics of the Coherence Manifold.
      confidence: 0.8
    - target: Particle (in QFT)
      domain: SM
      mapping_kind: operational
      justification: |
        Knots are the Pirouette framework's ontological primitive corresponding to what the Standard Model calls fundamental or composite particles. A specific type of Knot (a specific stable solution) corresponds to a specific particle species (e.g., electron, proton).
      confidence: 0.9
  adopted:
    - target: Particle (QFT) / Soliton (Non-linear PDE)
      rationale: The term 'Particle' provides the correct operational mapping to experimental physics and the Standard Model, while 'Soliton' provides the most accurate mathematical and conceptual analogue for a self-sustaining, localized pattern emerging from a continuous field.
      confidence: 0.9
constraints_and_falsifiers:
  claims:
    - statement: "The mass-energy and quantum numbers of all observed stable particles can be derived as eigenvalues of discrete, stable solutions to the Pirouette Lagrangian."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "The discovery of a stable fundamental particle whose properties cannot be derived as a stable resonant mode of the Pirouette Lagrangian. Conversely, the derivation of a stable Knot solution that corresponds to no observed particle in nature."
      status: proposed

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol K is often used for kinetic energy in classical mechanics. In Pirouette, K_œÑ denotes Temporal Coherence (a kinetic-like term), while K·µ¢ denotes a Knot instance.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from 'Knot Theory' in mathematics, which studies the topology of embeddings in 3D space. While conceptually related via stable topology, a Pirouette Knot is a dynamic, energetic process in spacetime, not a static geometric object.
