        The Principle of Anticipatory Accountability: An entity is accountable not only for the measurable residue of its past actions but also for maintaining a state of coherent foresight to prevent foreseeable harm. Responsibility is a function of both performance and potential.
  editors: [System AI]
  review_log: []
triad:
  art: |
    Responsibility is not just the wake a ship leaves behind, but the vigilance of its watchtower scanning the horizon.
  law: |
    An entity's operational freedom, as defined by its Dynamic Parametric Gates, is an inverse function of its accumulated consequence (Cumulative Residue, $R_c$).
  philosophy: |
    True responsibility is proactive, not reactive; it requires possessing the wisdom and readiness to prevent harm, not just the capacity to repair it after the fact.
pirouette_definition: |
  The core principle that an entity is accountable for both the measurable results of its past actions (residue) and for actively maintaining a state of coherent foresight to prevent foreseeable harm. This extends responsibility beyond mere consequence to include the actor's state of readiness and potential, making accountability a function of both performance and preparedness.
operational_definition:
  units: dimensionless (principle)
  symbol_table:
    - name: $R_c$
      meaning: Cumulative Residue
      dimensions: Context-dependent (integral of Wound Channel)
      default_range: "[0, ∞)"
  measurement:
    procedures:
      - name: Sentinel Protocol Loop
        outline: |
          The principle is measured indirectly through its implementation in the Sentinel Protocol. An entity's actions generate a measurable Wound Channel, which is integrated over time into its Cumulative Residue ($R_c$). This $R_c$ value then directly modulates the tightness of the entity's future Dynamic Parametric Gates, thus operationalizing its accountability.

    excerpt: |
      This protocol replaces static, arbitrary boundary definitions with a dynamic, learning system grounded in the philosophical principle of **Anticipatory Accountability**. It provides a robust, resilient, and standardized method for governing system scope by making any entity accountable for both its state of readiness and the full consequences of its actions.

  - module: PDM-001-Inversion_Proposal-v1.0
    excerpt: |
      Instead of just logging **Cumulative Residue ($R_c$)**—a debt—the system now also calculates a **Cumulative Coherence Dividend ($C_D$)**—an asset. This asset is not merely abstract; it would manifest within the system as Preferential Gating: Systems with a high $C_D$ would experience wider, less restrictive Parametric Gates, granting them greater freedom and velocity of action.

      justification: |
        NAT posits that accidents are inevitable in complex, tightly-coupled systems. Anticipatory Accountability is a governance principle designed to counter this by forcing actors to internalize both the potential for cascading failure (foresight) and the cost of actual failures (residue), thereby managing the conditions Perrow identifies as leading to "normal" accidents.

  claims:
    - statement: "A system governed by Anticipatory Accountability will exhibit fewer catastrophic 'Normal Accidents' for a given level of complexity and coupling than a system governed by purely retrospective liability."
      domain: phenomenology|experiment
      falsifier: "In a controlled simulation (e.g., Test Case 001: 'The Leaky Dam'), the Sentinel Protocol fails to reduce the frequency or magnitude of systemic failures compared to a control system with static boundaries and post-facto penalties."

  disambiguation: |
    Unlike traditional 'accountability', which is often purely retrospective (assigning blame after an event), Anticipatory Accountability includes a prospective component. It holds entities responsible for their *state of readiness* and *foresight* before an action is even taken, not just for the consequences after.
