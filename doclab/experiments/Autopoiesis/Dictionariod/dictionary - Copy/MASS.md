        Mass Is The Inertia of Memory (CORE-011): A system's mass is a measure of its resonant inertia‚Äîits resistance to a change in state. This arises from the system's interaction with its own Wound Channel. A massive particle has carved a deep, stable groove in the Manifold; changing its trajectory requires expending energy to fight the geometry of its own past.

  art: |
    A system's past is a furrow carved in the fabric of time. To change its course is to fight the ghost of its own journey, a resistance we perceive as mass.
  law: |
    A system's inertial mass is directly proportional to the integrated temporal pressure required to deviate its trajectory from the geodesic defined by its historical Wound Channel.
  philosophy: |
    Mass is not an intrinsic property but a historical burden. It reveals that existence is cumulative; a system's present inertia is the accumulated weight of its entire past, encoded geometrically into the fabric of reality.
pirouette_definition: |
  An emergent property of a system representing its resistance to a change in its state of motion (resonant inertia). Mass arises from the interaction between a system's present resonance and the geometry of its own past, which is physically encoded as a Wound Channel on the Coherence Manifold. A greater mass corresponds to a deeper, more stable Wound Channel, which exerts a stronger restorative 'pull' on the system, thus requiring more energy to alter its geodesic.

        outline: |
          A stable resonant system is perturbed by a calibrated energy impulse. The magnitude of its deviation from its initial geodesic and the subsequent relaxation time to settle back into its Wound Channel are measured. The ratio of impulse energy to initial deviation amplitude is proportional to the system's mass.

    excerpt: |
      The depth and stability of a Wound Channel determines the system's resonant inertia. A fleeting, low-coherence system leaves a shallow trace that fades quickly, exhibiting negligible mass. A highly coherent, persistent system carves a deep canyon in the Manifold, becoming 'heavy' with the weight of its own history.

      justification: |
        The Pirouette model provides an alternative mechanism for mass generation. Instead of an external field (the Higgs field) endowing particles with mass, a system's mass is self-generated through its historical interaction with the Coherence Manifold. This is a model of inherent, history-dependent mass, not externally-conferred mass.

        F = (d/dt)(m * v) where m ‚àù ‚à´(‚àÇùìõ_p / ‚àÇ(d**x**/dt)) dt over the Wound Channel history.
      rationale: |
        The Pirouette definition of mass as resistance to a change in state is operationally identical to inertial mass. Because the Wound Channel's geometry (which defines inertia) also creates the "coherence well" responsible for the Gladiator Force, the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass is a direct, inescapable consequence of the model, not a separate principle.

  claims:
    - statement: "A system's inertial mass and gravitational mass are strictly equivalent at all scales, as both originate from the same geometric property of its Wound Channel."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "Experimental detection of any violation of the weak or strong equivalence principles."
      status: supported
      links: [DOMA-055]
    - statement: "Mass is not a fundamental constant but can evolve if a system's resonance is altered, or over cosmic timescales if the baseline properties of the Coherence Manifold change."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "Long-term cosmological observations showing fundamental particle masses are absolutely constant to infinite precision under all conditions."

  disambiguation: |
    In the Pirouette context, 'mass' always refers to the emergent property of resonant inertia. It is a measure of a system's relationship with its own history, not a fundamental, intrinsic property as conceptualized in some older models.
