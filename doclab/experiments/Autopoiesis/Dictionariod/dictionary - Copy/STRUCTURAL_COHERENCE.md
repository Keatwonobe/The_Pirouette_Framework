        **Structural Coherence (The Hum of Being):** This component of the spectrum represents the frequencies that contribute to the system's self-containment and stable form. It is the audible expression of the **Gladiator Force (CORE-008)**. These are the deep, self-reinforcing harmonics that hold the system together, defining its identity and inertia. A strong, clear structural spectrum indicates a robust, stable entity.

    This is the deep, resonant hum of a thing being itself. It is the sound of the cello's wood, not the notes flying from its strings. It is the system's inward-facing song of self-affirmation.
  law: |
    A system's structural coherence is the set of low-frequency, narrow-bandwidth, high-persistence resonances that define its stable form and inertia. The total amplitude of these resonances is directly proportional to the system's stability against ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).
  philosophy: |
    Structural coherence is the foundation of identity. It is the audible trace of the Gladiator Force binding a system's components into a persistent whole. Without it, there is no "self" to interact with the world, only a transient collection of parts.
pirouette_definition: |
  The component of a system's total Temporal Coherence (K_τ) that constitutes its stable form, self-containment, and identity. Manifesting as low-frequency, high-persistence resonances in a Resonant Spectrum Analysis, it is the measurable expression of the Gladiator Force (CORE-008) that counteracts ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).
operational_definition:
  units: Ki (dimensionless coherence units) or Joules (when mapped to energy).
  symbol_table:
    - name: K_τ (structural)
      meaning: The total amplitude of all constituent resonances classified as structural.
      dimensions: M L^2 T^-2 (Energy) or dimensionless (as a Lagrangian term).
      default_range: contextual; > 0 for any stable system.

      - name: Resonant Spectrum Mode Separation
        outline: |
          1. Acquire a time-series signature of the system's activity.
          2. Apply a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to generate a spectrogram.
          3. Identify persistent, high-energy "ridges" in the spectrogram.
          4. Classify ridges as Structural if they exhibit low fundamental frequency (ω_k), narrow bandwidth (Δω), and high persistence (Δt).
          5. Sum the amplitudes of all identified structural ridges to quantify total K_τ (structural).
        expected_signals: [Persistent, narrow-band ridges at low frequencies.]
        pitfalls: [Misclassifying a slow, external propagating coherence as internal structure; instrumental noise floor obscuring low-amplitude structural hum.]

    excerpt: |
      To truly know a cello, you must listen. You must learn to distinguish the deep, resonant voice of the wood itself from the clear, soaring notes that fly from its strings. One is the sound of its being; the other is the sound of its song. They are not two different things, but two expressions of a single, vibrant whole.

        K_τ (structural) ∝ E_0 = mc²
      justification: |
        Structural coherence quantifies the internal, self-reinforcing patterns that give a system its stable form and inertia. This is conceptually analogous to a system's rest mass energy or the binding energy that holds its constituents together, representing the energy cost of its existence as a coherent entity.

  disambiguation: |
    Structural Coherence must be distinguished from **Propagating Coherence**. Structural is the inward-facing, self-maintaining aspect of a system's existence (its "being"). Propagating is the outward-facing, interactive aspect (its "doing" or "song"). It is an evolution of the older, less precise concept of `Ki_rest`.
