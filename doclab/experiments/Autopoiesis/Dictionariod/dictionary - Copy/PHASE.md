    The phase ϕ of a system is a scalar field, bounded on [0, 2π), representing the system's instantaneous position within its dominant resonant cycle as determined by the Universal Resonance Lens.
  philosophy: |
    Phase allows the framework to distinguish between systems that are merely active and those that are synchronized. It is the coordinate of coherence, capturing the timing and alignment that underpins all resonant phenomena.
pirouette_definition: |
  Phase (ϕ) is a scalar field representing the instantaneous state of a system within a cyclical process. It is derived by the Universal Resonance Lens (URL) Forge, which projects a system's high-dimensional data stream onto a lower-dimensional fractal geometry. The phase value corresponds to a specific coordinate or angle on this geometry, capturing the system's progress through its characteristic resonant pattern.

      A Weaver observing a debate would use the URL to transform the transcript into a flow of coherence data.

        Phase ϕ in Pirouette is directly analogous to the argument θ of a complex number z. The URL projection can be conceptualized as mapping a system's state vector to a point on the complex plane, where ϕ describes its angle and a separate field (e.g., Γ) relates to its magnitude r.

      justification: |
        Similar to the phase constant in a simple harmonic oscillator, Pirouette's ϕ represents the system's position within its fundamental cycle. However, in Pirouette, ϕ is a time-varying field (ϕ(t)), not a static constant, tracking the dynamic evolution of the system's cyclical state.

        The complex number representation is more fundamental and general than specific physical oscillator models. It cleanly separates magnitude from the cyclical position (ϕ), aligning perfectly with the Pirouette field structure (Tₐ, Γ, ϕ).

# Phase

## Canonical (Pirouette)
Phase (ϕ) is a scalar field representing the instantaneous state of a system within a cyclical process. It is derived by the Universal Resonance Lens (URL) Forge, which projects a system's high-dimensional data stream onto a lower-dimensional fractal geometry. The phase value corresponds to a specific coordinate or angle on this geometry, capturing the system's progress through its characteristic resonant pattern.

## EFT-First Summary
Phase (ϕ) is operationally equivalent to the argument of a complex number, `exp(iϕ)`, used to represent the state of a system. The Universal Resonance Lens maps system dynamics to a trajectory on the complex plane, where ϕ is the angular coordinate. This provides a direct, quantitative measure of a system's position within its primary cycle, analogous to the phase of an oscillator in classical mechanics.
