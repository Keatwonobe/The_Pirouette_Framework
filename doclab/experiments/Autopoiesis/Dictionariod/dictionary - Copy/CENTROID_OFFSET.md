    A silent ghost of gravity passes through a storm of its own making. Its true position is betrayed by the lingering, shocked tempest of baryonic gas left in its wake.
  law: |
    The peak offset Œîx between the total mass centroid (traced by lensing Œ∫) and the baryonic gas centroid (traced by X-ray emission S_X) is a deterministic, predictable function of the initial merger parameters (M‚ÇÅ, M‚ÇÇ, b, v_in, z) and the frozen Œì-potential V(Œì), with no tunable particle cross-section.
  philosophy: |
    The Centroid Offset is the primary observable for differentiating collisionless and collisional components of the universe on large scales. Within Pirouette, it serves as a critical test of the non-particulate, field-like nature of Œì-condensates, transforming a constraint on a particle property (œÉ/m) into a sharp prediction of the underlying field dynamics.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Centroid Offset, Œîx, is the time-dependent physical separation vector between the centroid of the total mass surface density (Œ£), traced by gravitational lensing (Œ∫), and the centroid of the hot, X-ray emitting intracluster medium (ICM), traced by X-ray surface brightness (S_X). In the context of galaxy cluster mergers, Œîx arises because the collisionless Œì-condensate halos pass through each other while the baryonic gas components collide, shock, and lag behind. Its magnitude and evolution are direct consequences of the Œì-field equations and the Euler equations for the gas, governed by the frozen potential V(Œì).

          1. Obtain deep, wide-field optical/IR imaging of a merging galaxy cluster to construct a gravitational lensing convergence map (Œ∫), which traces the projected total mass.
          2. Obtain deep X-ray observations (e.g., Chandra, XMM-Newton) of the same system to create a surface brightness map (S_X) of the hot intracluster gas.
          3. Register both maps to a common astrometric coordinate system.
          4. Identify the coordinates of the primary peak(s) in both the Œ∫ map and the S_X map.
          5. Calculate the angular separation on the sky between the corresponding peaks.
          6. Convert the angular separation to a physical distance (Œîx) using the angular diameter distance to the cluster's redshift.

        The Centroid Offset is the direct observational analogue of the separation between the dark matter component (traced by lensing) and the baryonic gas (traced by X-rays) in merging galaxy clusters. In standard cosmology, this observable is a key tool for constraining the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter (œÉ/m). Pirouette recasts this measurement as a direct prediction of Œì-field dynamics.

    This term specifically refers to the bulk offset between the total mass and the hot intracluster gas on ~100 kpc scales in cluster mergers. It should be distinguished from other astrophysical offsets, such as the separation between a central galaxy and its host dark matter halo (e.g., from splashback), or stellar-gas offsets within individual galaxies.

# Centroid Offset

## Canonical (Pirouette)
The Centroid Offset, Œîx, is the time-dependent physical separation vector between the centroid of the total mass surface density (Œ£), traced by gravitational lensing (Œ∫), and the centroid of the hot, X-ray emitting intracluster medium (ICM), traced by X-ray surface brightness (S_X). In the context of galaxy cluster mergers, Œîx arises because the collisionless Œì-condensate halos pass through each other while the baryonic gas components collide, shock, and lag behind. Its magnitude and evolution are direct consequences of the Œì-field equations and the Euler equations for the gas, governed by the frozen potential V(Œì).

## EFT-First Summary
The Centroid Offset is the Pirouette Framework's operational analogue for the observed separation between dark matter and baryonic gas in merging galaxy clusters, exemplified by the Bullet Cluster. This separation, measured via gravitational lensing and X-ray imaging, is used in standard cosmology to place upper limits on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter (œÉ/m). In Pirouette, this offset is not determined by a tunable particle cross-section but is a predictable, deterministic outcome of the field dynamics of the Œì-condensate. This provides a sharp, falsifiable test of the underlying frozen potential V(Œì) that governs the Œì-field's behavior.
