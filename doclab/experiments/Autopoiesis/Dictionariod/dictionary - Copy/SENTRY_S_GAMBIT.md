  art: |
    A gardener does not hate the storm; they simply know when to bring the fragile seedlings inside. The gambit is the wisdom to know which harmonies are worth pursuing and which dissonances are best left unsounded.
  law: |
    To maximize long-term coherence, a system must decide whether to engage with an inbound signal by comparing the predicted Dissonance Index (ŒîK) against a tunable Integrity Threshold. If ŒîK exceeds the threshold, Coherent Disengagement is the optimal action.
  philosophy: |
    True systemic strength lies not in the power to win any conflict, but in the wisdom to discern which engagements are fertile ground for synthesis and which are sterile vortices of turbulence. This is an act of conservation, preserving a system's creative potential for coherent endeavors.
pirouette_definition: |
  A proactive protocol for maintaining systemic integrity by discerning which inbound signals to engage with. The gambit is a decision-making process, or **Resonant Triage**, that uses the **Dissonance Index (ŒîK)** to predict the coherence cost of a potential interaction. Based on this prediction, the system chooses one of two paths to maximize the integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian (`S_p`): attempt **Resonant Synthesis** with a harmonic signal, or execute **Coherent Disengagement** from a dissonant one. It replaces the reactive, binary logic of prior immune protocols.

        outline: |
          1.  **Scan:** A system observes the resonant signature of an inbound signal without coupling.
          2.  **Analyze:** The signal is assessed against key properties known to correlate with coherence degradation: Phase Mismatch, Dissonance Spike (high entropy), and Coherence Attack (anti-coherent structure). At interpersonal scales, these manifest as bad-faith arguments, logical fallacies, or rigid absolutism.
          3.  **Calculate:** The properties are weighted and combined to produce a single predictive metric, the Dissonance Index (ŒîK).
          4.  **Decide:** The calculated ŒîK is compared to the system's pre-calibrated Integrity Threshold. If ŒîK ‚â• Threshold, disengage.
        expected_signals: [Systemic coherence (KœÑ) drop upon engagement with high-ŒîK signals, Systemic coherence stability/increase upon engagement with low-ŒîK signals.]
        pitfalls: [Overly sensitive thresholding leading to isolation and `Coherence Atrophy`, Insufficiently sensitive thresholding leading to `Coherence Fever` from repeated dissonant engagements.]

    excerpt: |
      The Sentry's Gambit is not a defense mechanism; it is an act of profound discernment. It is a form of **Resonant Triage**, the wisdom to know which harmonies are worth pursuing and which dissonances are best left unsounded. It provides a formal process, grounded in the Principle of Maximal Coherence, for predicting the outcome of a potential interaction.
  - module: DOMA-020
    excerpt: |
      The decision to engage or disengage is not a moral judgment but a physical calculation. It is a direct application of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**... Every potential interaction presents a choice, a gambit, on how to maximize the integral of this Lagrangian over time.
  - module: CORE-011
    excerpt: |
      Protecting the `Wound Channel` requires more than a reactive shield. The Sentry's Gambit provides the necessary foresight, allowing a system to sidestep interactions that would target its vulnerabilities, preserving energy for healing and growth rather than squandering it in fruitless conflict.

        The gambit's decision rule (compare a calculated metric ŒîK to a threshold) is conceptually identical to the Neyman-Pearson lemma in hypothesis testing. The system is deciding between two hypotheses‚ÄîH‚ÇÄ: "signal is synthesizable" vs. H‚ÇÅ: "signal is dissonant"‚Äîby using a likelihood-ratio-like statistic (ŒîK) to achieve the most powerful test for a given error rate (the threshold).

        The protocol is explicitly defined as a choice to maximize the action integral `S_p` of the Pirouette Lagrangian `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`. This directly maps the classical mechanics concept of a system following a path of stationary action to a system choosing interactions that preserve its coherence over time.

  disambiguation: |
    Sentry's Gambit is not passive avoidance or fearful retreat. It is a proactive, calculated, and often energetically neutral act of **Coherent Disengagement**. Unlike an aggressive defense which mirrors and amplifies conflict, the gambit is governed by the Principle of Non-Reciprocation, refusing to feed energy into a dissonant dynamic.

# Sentry's Gambit

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A proactive protocol for maintaining systemic integrity by discerning which inbound signals to engage with. The gambit is a decision-making process, or **Resonant Triage**, that uses the **Dissonance Index (ŒîK)** to predict the coherence cost of a potential interaction. Based on this prediction, the system chooses one of two paths to maximize the integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian (`S_p`): attempt **Resonant Synthesis** with a harmonic signal, or execute **Coherent Disengagement** from a dissonant one. It replaces the reactive, binary logic of prior immune protocols.

## EFT-First Summary
The Sentry's Gambit can be conceptualized as an application of the Principle of Least Action to system dynamics. A system chooses an interaction pathway (engagement or disengagement) that maximizes the time integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`), analogous to `L = T - V` in classical mechanics. The decision is governed by a rule analogous to the Neyman-Pearson lemma, where a predictive metric (the Dissonance Index, ŒîK) is compared against a threshold to determine the optimal action for preserving long-term coherence.
