  art: |
    The universal song sung in the accent of the local choir. It is the texture of the drum that gives the rhythm its voice, the grain of the wood that shapes the flame. This potential is the unique timbre of reality in each domain.
  law: |
    The function f(Γ; S) maps the universal temporal pressure field (Γ) onto a domain-specific potential energy landscape, determined by the substrate's (S) properties (e.g., permittivity, neural plasticity, social trust). Its gradient dictates the substrate's response to coherence fluxes.
  philosophy: |
    This function embodies the principle that universal laws are not monolithic but are expressed through the specific character of their medium. It rejects a purely reductionist view by granting causal power to the substrate itself, enabling the same formal dynamics to manifest as consciousness in one domain and social cohesion in another.
pirouette_definition: |
  The Substrate-specific constitutive potential, denoted f(Γ; S), is the component of the Pirouette Lagrangian density (\mathcal{L}_p) that accounts for the unique dynamic properties of a given substrate S. It functions as a potential energy term, adapting the universal time-adherence and phase-winding dynamics to the specific constraints and response functions of the domain, such as the dielectric properties of a physical medium or the neuroplasticity of a cognitive system.

          1. Concurrently measure the coherence current (Jµ) and temporal pressure (Γ) within a target substrate.
          2. From the Universal Continuity Equation, calculate the divergence of the coherence flux, ∂µJµ.
          3. This divergence is driven by the source/sink term derived from f(Γ; S).
          4. Invert the equation to solve for the functional form of f(Γ; S) that reproduces the observed dynamics.

        pitfalls: [High signal-to-noise ratio required for stable inversion, Non-stationarity of the substrate S during measurement can corrupt the reconstruction]

    excerpt: |
      The canonical Pirouette Lagrangian density is `\mathcal{L}_p = T_a , \omega_k - f(\Gamma; S)`, where `T_a` is time adherence, `\omega_k` is phase winding density, and `f(\Gamma; S)` is the substrate-specific constitutive potential. This potential term is essential for adapting the universal equation to the specific medium being modeled.

    excerpt: |
      Phase symmetry breaking without corresponding flux imbalance indicates missing substrate terms in f(Γ; S). This provides a direct falsifiability criterion for testing the completeness of a substrate model. Each domain expresses the same conservation law via its substrate-specific constitutive map (\chi_S).

        L_eff = (∂φ)² - V(φ; {g_i}) where g_i are medium-dependent couplings.
      justification: |
        In effective field theory, the potential V(φ) for a field φ often includes terms whose coefficients (couplings g_i) are specific to the low-energy regime or medium. f(Γ; S) plays an analogous role, encoding the substrate-specific response into the potential energy term of the Pirouette Lagrangian.

      justification: |
        Constitutive relations connect fundamental fields (like E) to material-response fields (like D) via substrate parameters (like permittivity ε). While f is a potential, not a direct relation, it serves the same conceptual purpose: embedding the specific properties of a material into a universal physical law.

    - statement: "For any two distinct substrates S₁ and S₂ (e.g., neural tissue vs. a social network), their corresponding potentials f(Γ; S₁) and f(Γ; S₂) must be functionally different."
      domain: theory
      falsifier: "If f is found to be universal and independent of S, the concept of substrate-specificity is void, and the framework would need a different mechanism to account for cross-domain differences."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol `f` is commonly used for a generic function.]
  disambiguation: |
    In Pirouette notation, `f` is almost always used in the context `f(Γ; S)` to distinguish it from a generic function. "Constitutive" is used in the sense of a 'constitutive relation' in physics, defining how a substrate responds to a field. "Potential" refers to its role as a potential energy term in the Lagrangian.
