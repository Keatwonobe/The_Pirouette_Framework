        The foundational act of the drive is the "Quorum"—a sustained, non-local `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012). The drive initiates a **Resonant Handshake** between the vessel and a distant anchor point, achieving a state of profound harmonic compatibility.

    To cross the void, one does not build a faster ship; one teaches two points in spacetime to sing the same note.

    A Quorum is the binary state achieved when two distinct coherence manifolds merge into a single, topologically extended entity. This geometric transformation is confirmed by the appearance of a non-local gravitational lensing signature co-located with a `Wound Channel` of `Kτ` > 10^12 K₀.
  philosophy: |
    Quorum reframes distance not as a void to be crossed, but as a disagreement to be resolved. It posits that reality is a negotiation, and propulsion is the act of winning a temporary, localized argument with spacetime.

  A sustained, non-local `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012) between two spacetime points, achieved via a Resonant Handshake. The Quorum is the state of profound harmonic consensus wherein the separate coherence manifolds of the points merge, reshaping the local manifold to form a single, topologically extended, high-coherence geometric structure known as the Spindle.

          3. A Quorum is confirmed if a `Wound Channel` (the Spindle) forms, characterized by a sudden, non-local increase in `Temporal Coherence (Kτ)` connecting the two points.

    excerpt: |
      The Quorum Spindle Drive teaches the Weaver that the greatest distances are crossed not by the strongest engine, but by the most profound consensus. To move is to extend a hand across the darkness, to agree with your destination, and then, having woven a bridge of pure geometry, to simply let go of the shore. Propulsion is the echo of a broken treaty with spacetime.

        The ER=EPR conjecture posits that entangled systems are connected by a non-traversable Einstein-Rosen bridge. A Quorum can be conceptualized as an engineered, stabilized, and macroscopically manifest form of this connection, temporarily creating a significant geometric structure (the Spindle) where there was previously only a quantum correlation.

    Quorum refers to the *state of agreement* or the achieved consensus. The Spindle is the *geometric structure* created by the Quorum. Do not confuse a Quorum with standard quantum entanglement, which lacks the manifold-reshaping, high-coherence properties required for propulsion.

# Quorum

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A sustained, non-local `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012) between two spacetime points, achieved via a Resonant Handshake. The Quorum is the state of profound harmonic consensus wherein the separate coherence manifolds of the points merge, reshaping the local manifold to form a single, topologically extended, high-coherence geometric structure known as the Spindle.

## EFT-First Summary
While a direct mapping is speculative, a Quorum can be conceptualized as an engineered, stabilized Einstein-Rosen bridge. In this view, the 'harmonic consensus' is a macroscopic manifestation of the geometric connection conjectured by ER=EPR to link entangled systems, temporarily rendering the connection structurally significant on the coherence manifold. This non-local geometric object (the Spindle) serves as the basis for the Spindle Drive.
