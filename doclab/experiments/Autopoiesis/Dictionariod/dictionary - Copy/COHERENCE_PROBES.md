  art: |
    A single, whispered question posed to a life not lived, testing whether its echo holds a song. It is the tentative footstep onto a bridge of ghosts, to see if it holds your weight.
  law: |
    A Coherence Probe is a discrete, low-cost action (transitional pressure `ΔV_Γ` → 0) that introduces a resonant pattern (`Ki`) from a latent path into a current life-geodesic, generating a measurable change in subjective coherence (`ΔKτ`).
  philosophy: |
    Change is not a leap of faith but a series of small, reversible experiments. Probes privilege empirical self-knowledge over romantic projection, allowing for authentic integration without destructive revolution.
pirouette_definition: |
  A discrete, low-cost, experimental action (`π_p`) that introduces a resonant pattern (`Ki`) from a latent path into an individual's current life-geodesic. Coherence Probes are the constituent elements of a Resonance Bridge, designed to safely draw information and coherence (`ΔKτ`) from an unchosen life-path while minimizing transitional pressure (`V_Γ`). The goal is to test the felt-sense of a latent path's potential before committing to larger-scale changes.

        outline: |
          1. Identify a high-resonance latent path (e.g., "the musician-self").
          2. Design a minimal, reversible, low-cost action embodying its core `Ki` (e.g., practice an instrument for 15 minutes daily for one week).
          3. Log subjective coherence (`Kτ`) and ambient pressure (`Γ`) via daily journaling before, during, and after the probe period.
          4. Analyze the logged `ΔKτ` for a positive signal.
        expected_signals: [Increased `Kτ` (flow, purpose, joy), Decreased `Γ` (anxiety, restlessness), Somatic reports of "feeling right" or "coming home"]
        pitfalls: [Confounding the probe's effect with idealization of the latent path, Choosing a probe that is too high-cost (violating `ΔV_Γ` → 0), Misinterpreting an initial learning curve's frustration as a negative resonance signal]

    excerpt: |
      A Resonance Bridge is a series of small, deliberate, low-cost actions designed to weave the coherence of a latent path into the fabric of your present reality. [...] These actions are Coherence Probes: experiments that allow you to safely draw energy and information from the latent path. Over time, these small bridges can transform your current geodesic, not by replacing it, but by enriching it into a new, more fulfilling synthesis.
  - module: DOMA-166
    excerpt: |
      If the "artist" path resonates strongly, the bridge is not to quit your job and move to a loft. It is to buy a sketchbook and draw for fifteen minutes a day. If the "adventurer" echo is loud, the bridge is to plan a challenging weekend hike, not to sell your house and buy a sailboat. These actions are Coherence Probes.

        a_t ← random action with probability ε
      justification: |
        In an ε-greedy algorithm, an agent takes a small-probability (ε) random action rather than the optimal known action to explore the state space for potentially higher rewards. A Coherence Probe is a *deliberate*, not random, exploratory action into a hypothesized high-reward (high-`Kτ`) region of the personal state space, taken to update the value function of that latent path. It prioritizes information gain about a specific alternative policy over immediate reward maximization.

  claims:
    - statement: "A series of well-formed Coherence Probes consistently increases an individual's baseline subjective coherence (`Kτ`) more effectively and with lower risk of system destabilization than a single, large-scale life change aimed at the same latent path."
      domain: phenomenology
      falsifier: "A longitudinal study demonstrates that individuals who make abrupt, 'all-in' life changes toward a resonant latent path report higher long-term coherence and life satisfaction than those who use an incremental, probe-based approach."

naming_notes:
  collisions: [The symbol π is used for the mathematical constant; the subscript `p` is essential for disambiguation.]
  disambiguation: |
    Distinguish from a general 'test' or 'experiment.' A Coherence Probe is specifically designed to sample the *resonant quality* (`Ki`) of a latent path, not just to gather objective information. The primary data returned is subjective and somatic, measuring the change in felt coherence (`ΔKτ`).
