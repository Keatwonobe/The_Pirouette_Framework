        Summary
        The Pirouette Rubric is an operational implementation of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), where proposed changes are treated as alternatives evaluated against a weighted utility function. The criteria (coherence, parsimony, etc.) serve as the utility dimensions, ensuring that repository evolution maximizes a defined set of intellectual virtues.
