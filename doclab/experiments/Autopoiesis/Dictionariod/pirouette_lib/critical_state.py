        Summary
        The Critical State is the Pirouette Framework's direct conceptual mapping of **Self-Organized Criticality (SOC)**, a key concept from complexity science and statistical physics. The framework recasts the spatial "sandpile" analogy of SOC into a temporal dynamic of pressure and release. The system's condition at its maximum angle of repose is precisely the Critical State, and the resulting power-law distributed avalanches are identified as Coherence Cascades.
