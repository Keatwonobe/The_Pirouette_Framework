        Summary
        The Lens is conceptually analogous to identifying an **order parameter** in statistical mechanics. It seeks a single, low-dimensional variable (Coherence, KÏ„) that effectively describes the macroscopic state of a complex system, much like magnetization describes the collective state of spins in a magnet. Operationally, it functions as a form of principled **dimensionality reduction**, collapsing a high-dimensional data space onto the single, physically meaningful axis of coherence.
