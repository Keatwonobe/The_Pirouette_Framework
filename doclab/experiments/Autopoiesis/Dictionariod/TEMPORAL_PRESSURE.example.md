    The hand on the world’s metronome—tightening the drumhead until rhythm appears.
  law: |
    Γ parameterizes the local rate-of-change pressure conjugate to temporal density; in any closed region, variations in Γ source flows that equilibrate under boundary conditions minimizing the system’s time-action.
  philosophy: |
    Γ encodes how beings feel the world ‘hurry’ or ‘loosen’. It operationalizes urgency as physics: why structure gels where time is taut and frays where it slackens.

  A scalar field controlling the local ‘tightness’ of time. Positive gradients in Γ increase time-adherence and reduce stochastic drift; negative gradients relax adherence and permit higher variance dynamics.

# Temporal Pressure

## Canonical (Pirouette)
A scalar field controlling the local ‘tightness’ of time. Positive gradients in Γ increase time-adherence and reduce stochastic drift; negative gradients relax adherence and permit higher variance dynamics.

## EFT-First Summary
Interpretable as an effective stiffness parameter influencing fluctuation spectra; conceptually adjacent to pressure derivatives in k-essence-like EFTs (see candidates). Mapping remains provisional (confidence 0.6).
