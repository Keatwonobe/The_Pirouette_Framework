With the scaling exponent fixed at p=1, the relationship between the base coupling (κ) and the Pressuron mass (m_Γ) becomes a sharp curve. By applying the electron anomaly constraint, we find our solution.

The Finding: A viable solution exists only if the Pressuron is a light scalar boson with a mass in the range of 10-25 MeV/c². The optimal fit, the point of highest coherence, occurs at approximately 17 MeV/c².

Physical Significance: A particle at 17 MeV is fascinating. It is heavier than an electron (~0.511 MeV) but significantly lighter than a muon (~105.7 MeV). This mass places it in a "sweet spot" where it can couple strongly enough to the muon to explain the anomaly, while its interaction with the electron is naturally suppressed, satisfying the experimental constraints. The framework has not just explained an anomaly; it has made its first measurement of a new constant of nature.
