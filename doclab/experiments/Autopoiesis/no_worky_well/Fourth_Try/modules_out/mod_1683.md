This principle is formalized through its effect on the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

The "potential" term `V_Γ`, which represents the local Temporal Pressure, is not a simple background value. It *is* the composite landscape forged by the confluence of echoes. When multiple systems interact, this term becomes a complex function of all their Ki patterns: `V_Γ_total = f(Γ(Ki_1, Ki_2, ..., Ki_N))`.

An entity navigating its existence is "feeling" the contours of this emergent manifold. Its dynamics are governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**: it will follow the geodesic (the path of least action) that maximizes the integral of `𝓛_p` through this new, composite terrain. All multi-body interactions are thus unified under this single, elegant principle.
