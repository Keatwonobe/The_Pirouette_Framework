The coherence manifold is an active, dynamic landscape shaped by the universal drive for coherence, as defined by the `Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)`. Its topology is continuously altered by the sum of all historical events, each of which carves a `Wound Channel (CORE-011)` into its fabric.

The paths of least resistance through this landscape are not lines on a page, but **geodesics on the coherence manifold**. These are the most efficient and stable pathways a system can take, the universe's natural highways where coherence flows with maximum efficiency. As these paths are traveled, they deepen the Wound Channels, making them easier for the next traveler to find. The map writes itself into the world through the very act of being used.
