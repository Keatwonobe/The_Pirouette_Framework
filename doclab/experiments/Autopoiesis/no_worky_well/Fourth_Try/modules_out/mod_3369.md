1.  **Select Systems:** Use two identical, hyper-stable atomic clocks (e.g., strontium lattice clocks). One clock will remain in a terrestrial laboratory (e.g., NIST), serving as the high-gravity, low-velocity reference. The second clock will be placed in a stable orbit, for example, on a GPS satellite.
2.  **Establish Coherence Proxy:** We cannot measure Tₐ directly, but we can measure its effects. The stability and coherence of the clock's own resonant frequency is a direct proxy for its internal Tₐ. A lower Tₐ would manifest as increased phase noise or a broadening of the clock's spectral line.
3.  **Data Acquisition:** Over a long baseline (e.g., months), continuously monitor the spectral output of both clocks. The data must be corrected for all known relativistic effects on *time dilation* to isolate the predicted effect on *coherence*.
4.  **Analysis:**
    * Apply the **Ki-Sampling Protocol (`PPS-077`)** to the phase noise data of both clocks.
    * **Prediction:** The orbiting clock, being in a higher velocity state and a weaker gravitational potential, should have a lower Tₐ according to the new formula. This should manifest as a statistically significant increase in the detection rate of **Ki-resonant "swan" events** in its phase noise compared to the terrestrial clock. The terrestrial clock should appear more "stable" and "coherent."
