A system does not freeze by accident. It is driven into a state of Lock when it finds a uniquely deep and stable solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), creating a powerful feedback loop. The path of maximal coherence ceases to be a flowing river and becomes a trench from which escape is energetically improbable.

This occurs when two extreme conditions are met:

1.  **Extreme Internal Coherence (`Kτ` → max):** The system's internal resonance (`Ki`) becomes extraordinarily pure, stable, and noise-free. Its signal of "self" is so clear that it dominates its local environment.
2.  **Quiescent External Pressure (`V_Γ` → 0):** The system exists within a region of low temporal pressure, a quiet space free from disruptive, chaotic signals that would otherwise erode its coherence.

The feedback is potent: the system’s own perfect resonance quiets its surroundings, which in turn makes it even easier to maintain its perfect resonance. It digs its own coherence well deeper and deeper, reinforcing its own state until the walls become insurmountably steep. It has achieved perfect stability at the cost of all mobility.
