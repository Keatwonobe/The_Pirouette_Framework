We will establish an axiom for the framework: **An isolated proton at rest has a Gamma value of exactly 1.**

$$\Gamma_{proton} \equiv 1$$

This axiom anchors the entire **Gamma** scale. Every other **Γ** value will be a ratio relative to the proton's intrinsic confinement. This is not arbitrary; it's a foundational definition that makes **Γ** a measurable, relative scale.
