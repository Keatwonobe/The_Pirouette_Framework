When mapped to the Behavioral Triad of The Nomad's Grammar (CORE-002), the structure of Velcrid becomes starkly clear. This posture—Inward, Aligned, Isolated—is the universal geometry of tyranny.

*   **Vector: Maximally Inward.** All agency, resources, and information are perpetually drawn into the central will. The system consumes its own components to sustain its singular pattern.
*   **Cohesion: Maximally Aligned.** All parts are locked into a rigid, crystalline order. Deviation is not tolerated; it is identified as dissonance and ruthlessly eliminated.
*   **Communion: Pathologically Isolated.** The system is incapable of genuine transactional exchange. It cannot engage in an Alchemical Union because it cannot tolerate another Ki pattern; it can only assimilate or destroy. Internally, it treats its components not as partners, but as captured resources.
