To find the path that extremizes the action, we use the Euler-Lagrange equation. For a field phi, the equation is:

d/dt (dL_p / d(d(phi)/dt)) - dL_p / d(phi) = 0

This equation is the mathematical engine of our derivation. It tells us how the system's phase phi must evolve in time to maintain maximal coherence.
