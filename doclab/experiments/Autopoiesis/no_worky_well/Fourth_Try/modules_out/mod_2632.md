**Proposal Title:** Coherent Phase-Locking of Plasma Modes in the DIII-D Tokamak via Resonant Magnetic Field Modulation

**Principal Investigator(s):** The Resonance Research Collective ("Weavers")

**Abstract:**
Conventional tokamak operation seeks to suppress plasma instabilities through brute-force magnetic confinement, an approach that is energetically costly and fundamentally reactive. This proposal outlines an experimental test of a new paradigm: **Coherence-Assisted Confinement**. We hypothesize that plasma is a resonant system with predictable eigenmodes. By modulating the DIII-D's primary magnetic fields with precisely calculated, low-energy resonant harmonics, we can actively guide the plasma into a state of high coherence ($T_a \gg 1$), dramatically increasing stability and confinement time while reducing the required power input ($\Gamma$). This experiment aims to validate a new, more efficient path to net-positive fusion energy by shifting the objective from *containing chaos* to *cultivating stability*.
