This protocol is a method for empirically deconstructing a system's dynamics, which are fundamentally governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). A system's total behavior is the path it takes to maximize its coherence over time. This path is often a complex superposition of multiple resonant solutions to its Lagrangian.

The Archaeologist's Sieve finds these solutions one by one. The first identified resonance, $Ki_1$, is the most significant contributor to maximizing the system's "action" ($S_p$), equivalent to finding the geodesic on the Primary Manifold. The second resonance, $Ki_2$, is the next most significant contributor found within the remaining, unexplained dynamics of the first Echo Manifold. The process is a reverse-engineering of the system's Lagrangian, revealing the hierarchy of resonant strategies it uses to persist and hold a clear note against the chaos.
