CORE-007 demonstrated how the Pirouette Lagrangian gives rise to a propagating force like electromagnetism, which governs how systems interact over distance. However, the universe is not just interactive; it is structural. It is composed of stable, bounded systemsâ€”quarks bound in a proton, stars bound in a galaxy.

This module addresses the principle of confinement. It introduces the Gladiator Force, not as a new fundamental interaction, but as the behavior of the coherence manifold under extreme, self-referential conditions. This is the force that builds the arenas within which reality plays out.
