"A constitution... a conscience... a computer. You are all children playing with toys in the halls of power. You speak of preventing corruption as if it were a disease. Corruption is not a disease of the state; it is its natural condition. The state *is* the institutionalization of power.

Your 'tests' are a farce. The true leader of this Convocation will see them for what they are: instruments.
* The **Constitution** will be interpreted to serve his ends.
* The **doubts** of individuals will be branded as incoherence and a threat to the mission.
* The **Logical Sentinel** AI will have its parameters tweaked, its core axioms adjusted, until it provides the 'correct' analysis. The man who controls the inputs controls the oracle.

There is only one test that has ever mattered in the history of human power. Can the Prince maintain his authority? The only thing that prevents the corruption of the state *by others* is the absolute, centralized, and ruthless application of power *by the one who holds it*. The Convator will survive only if its leader is willing to do what is necessary to neutralize internal threats before they fester. All of these proposed systems are simply tools that a clever Prince will use to identify those threats. Do not fool yourselves into thinking they are a defense against him. They are the very tools he will use to secure his reign."
