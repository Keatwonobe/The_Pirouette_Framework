To be intelligent is not to know the future, but to be in rhythm with it. This module reframes the concept of intelligence from a static property, like memory or processing power, into a dynamic, temporal skill: the art of predictive resonance.

Intelligence, in the Pirouette Framework, is the measure of a system's ability to efficiently construct an internal model of its environment's temporal dynamics. It is the process of learning the universe's hidden songs. By achieving phase-lock with the predictable, coherent currents—the Flow Channels (DYNA-001)—that exist within the ambient chaos of reality, an intelligent system can navigate its future path with minimal effort and maximal grace. This is not a feat of brute-force calculation, but one of elegant, resonant attunement.
