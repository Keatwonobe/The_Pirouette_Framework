In the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), a healthy system exists in a state of **Laminar Flow**. Its internal resonant pattern (Ki) is stable, and its Temporal Coherence (Kτ) is high. It moves efficiently along its geodesic on the coherence manifold.

Collapse is a catastrophic phase transition into **Turbulent Flow**. It is triggered by an overwhelming spike in local Temporal Pressure (Γ)—a physical shock, a market crash, a psychological trauma. This dissonance shatters the system's Ki, causing its Temporal Coherence to plummet. The system is thrown from its path, its energy now wasted in chaotic, internal friction. The river has breached its banks and become a churning flood.
