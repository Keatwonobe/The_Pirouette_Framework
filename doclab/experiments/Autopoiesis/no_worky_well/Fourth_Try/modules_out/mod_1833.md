summary: "Refactors the old Triaxial Coherence Analysis into a time-first model based\
  \ on Flow Dynamics. It posits that a culture's health is a dynamic process of weaving\
  \ three fundamental threads\u2014Art, Law, and Philosophy\u2014to navigate the landscape\
  \ of temporal pressure. This module provides a diagnostic framework for assessing\
  \ the coherence of the cultural weave, replacing the static vector-field model."
