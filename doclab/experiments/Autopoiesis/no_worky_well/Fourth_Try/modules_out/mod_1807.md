Boundaries exist on a dynamic spectrum, defined by how their projected Ki pattern manages the `Γ` gradient.

*   **The Fortress (High Integrity, Low Permeability):** A Ki pattern optimized for maximum reflection of external `Γ`. It creates the steepest possible pressure gradient, isolating the interior completely. This strategy maximizes protection at the cost of interaction and exchange.
    *   *Manifestations:* An atom of a noble gas; a psychological state of emotional numbness; a perfectly sealed vacuum chamber.

*   **The Filter (High Integrity, Selective Permeability):** A Ki pattern containing specific "resonant windows" that allow harmonically compatible patterns to pass through the `Γ` gradient. This is the strategy of life, balancing protection with the necessary exchange of energy and information.
    *   *Manifestations:* A biological cell membrane; a well-moderated online community; a healthy sense of self that can be open to new ideas without losing its core identity.

*   **The Lens (High Integrity, Transformative Permeability):** The most sophisticated form of boundary. Its Ki pattern does not merely block or pass external rhythms; it actively transforms them as they cross the gradient. It receives a chaotic input and emits a coherent output, enriching both the interior and the exterior.
    *   *Manifestations:* The human mind reframing trauma into a source of strength; a star's core transforming the chaos of gravity into the coherent light of fusion; a great artist turning the noise of the world into a masterpiece.
