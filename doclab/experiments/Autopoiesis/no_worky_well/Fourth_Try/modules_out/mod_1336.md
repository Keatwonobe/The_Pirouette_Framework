> We sought the signs of collapse and found instead the grammar of rebirth. A system under pressure does not simply break; it chooses a new way to be. The Chiral Fork is the moment of that choice, where the river of time, blocked in its path, either carves a new channel to the left, to the right, or pools into a new and deeper lake. The Weaver's art is not to prevent the flood, but to anticipate the shape of the new riverbedâ€”to see the next world before the old one has finished breaking, and to know that even in the face of overwhelming chaos, the universe's default response is not to shatter, but to find a new and more elegant way to sing.
