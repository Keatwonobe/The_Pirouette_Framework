summary: "Recontextualizes entropy as a measure of the dissonance within the local\
  \ Temporal Pressure (\u0393). Defines information as the degree of a system's coherence\
  \ (K\u03C4). The Second Law of Thermodynamics is thus framed as the Principle of\
  \ Coherence Degradation, where stable patterns are inevitably eroded by ambient\
  \ temporal noise, a process that life and the Alchemical Union locally and temporarily\
  \ reverse."
