With this invariant Action established, the derivation of all physical laws becomes a direct mathematical consequence.

*   **The Stress-Energy Tensor (`T_ŒºŒΩ`):** By varying the Action with respect to the spacetime metric `g_ŒºŒΩ`, we derive the system's stress-energy tensor. This tensor describes how the energy and momentum of the Coherence and Pressure fields act as the source of gravity, sculpting the geometry of spacetime itself. The dance shapes the stage.
*   **The Equations of Motion:** Applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to `ùìõ` yields the fundamental wave equations for the `C` and `Œì` fields. These equations govern how coherence and pressure propagate, interfere, and organize into the resonant structures we call matter. The forces derived in subsequent modules are descriptions of how these field excitations interact.
