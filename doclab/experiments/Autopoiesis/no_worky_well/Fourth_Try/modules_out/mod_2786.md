Reducing a target's mental pools to a negative value does not grant the attacker mind control, but it does achieve a social victory.

Outcome: A "defeated" opponent might be persuaded to lower their prices, convinced of your argument for the moment, or intimidated into backing down.

Impermanence: Just like in the real world, the effects of a single conversation are rarely permanent. Water carves canyons over time. A convinced opponent may change their mind later, and an intimidated foe may return with reinforcements.
