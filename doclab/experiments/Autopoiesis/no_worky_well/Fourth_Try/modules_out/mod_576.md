Using the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014), we map the universal principles of flow to their specific manifestations within the social domain. The health of the civic body depends on the laminar flow of three primary **Vital Currents**:

*   **The Flow of Information:** The society's nervous system. It encompasses journalism, science, cultural narratives, and public discourse. A healthy flow is characterized by high-fidelity, low-latency, and widely accessible knowledge.
*   **The Flow of Resources:** The society's circulatory system. It includes the economy, infrastructure, and supply chains that move capital, goods, and energy. A healthy flow is efficient, equitable, and resilient.
*   **The Flow of Trust:** The society's connective tissue, the very medium of its coherence. It is the shared faith in institutions, social contracts, and common norms that enables collaboration. Trust is the most critical and most fragile current.

These currents move through channels shaped by a society's **Civic Resonators**â€”its core institutions (laws, markets, media, schools) which define the geometry of the manifold and amplify or dampen its coherence.
