We propose this as the final, unified model for PDM-001.

1.  **Dynamic Parametric Gates (The Shield):** All actions must pass through context-aware gates defined by thresholds on $T_a$, $\Gamma$, Ki-rate, and **Cumulative Residue**. These gates are not static; they are continuously recalibrated for each entity based on its history.
2.  **Act & Wound Channel Mapping (The Scale):** Upon execution, the action's full impact is mapped by measuring its perturbations until they return to baseline, creating an auditable Wound Channel.
3.  **Threshold-Based Ritual (The Adjudication):** If the measured Wound Channel exceeds the predicted "Gate Slack," the Reflexive Ritual is automatically invoked.
4.  **The Ritual's Dual Mandate (The Wisdom):** The Ritual uses the Wound Channel as evidence to (a) issue sanctions or remedies for the harm and (b) analyze emergent patterns to inform the recalibration of the Dynamic Gates.

This is a complete, learning system that deters, measures, and adapts.
