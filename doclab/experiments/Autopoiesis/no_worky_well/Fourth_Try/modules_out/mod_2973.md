This appendix provides the detailed mathematical models for the behavior of the Gladiator Force (Γ) and Time-Adherence (Ta​) fields, serving as the technical foundation for the principles outlined in PPS-033, PPS-034, and PPS-035. It formally replaces all previous derivations. This document details: 1) A model of the Γ-field's role in baryonic confinement, 2) The emergence of classical gravity from the Γ-field in the weak-field limit, and 3) A proposal for a falsifiable experiment to detect unique signatures of the Γ-field, distinct from Newtonian gravity.
