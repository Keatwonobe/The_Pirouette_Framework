\section*{§9 · Lemma: Γ-Derived Mass Invariance}
\begin{lemma}
Under τ-isometries (MATH-024L) the combination 
\(m^2 = \Gamma_0^2 / K_\Gamma\) 
is invariant.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
$K_\Gamma$ transforms as a temporal metric component, $\Gamma_0$ as a scalar density.  
Their ratio remains unchanged under $\tau\!\mapsto\!f(\tau)$, ensuring observer-independent mass definitions.
\end{proof}
