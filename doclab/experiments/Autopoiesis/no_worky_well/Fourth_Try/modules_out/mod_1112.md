This redefinition is not merely philosophical; it is mathematically essential. The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), the central engine of the framework, is given by:

`𝓛_p = Tₐ * ω_k - f(Γ)`

Here, `ω_k` is the system's fundamental angular frequency, defined as `2π/τ_p`. The Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`) is therefore a direct input into the kinetic term of the universe's objective function. Furthermore, `Tₐ`, as Temporal Coherence, now acts as a crucial quality factor. A system with high `Tₐ` (a clear rhythm) contributes more significantly to its own "action" than a system with low `Tₐ` (a noisy one).

A system's entire dynamic—its path through spacetime, its response to forces—is calculated relative to its own heartbeat. The system's "action" (`S_p`) is the integral of its Lagrangian over the duration of one of its own Pirouette Cycles:

`S_p = ∫ from 0 to τ_p of 𝓛_p dt`

This means a system lives, moves, and has its being according to the rhythm it generates for itself.
