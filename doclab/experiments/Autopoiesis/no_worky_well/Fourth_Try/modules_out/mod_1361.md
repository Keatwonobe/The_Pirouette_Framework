The universe does not waste its breath. It does not invent new laws for the termite mound and the galaxy; it whispers the same command at every scale. This is the Principle of Correspondence.

This module refactors the old "Fractal/Recursive Pattern Analysis" into a unified Core Principle. It moves beyond describing static geometry to understanding the *temporal process* that generates it. A fractal is not a shape; it is the physical trace of a **scale-invariant geodesic**â€”the universe's preferred solution for maximizing coherence in systems that must exist across a wide range of scales. These patterns are the signature of a single artist, written in the lightning, the river, and the neuron, revealing a fundamental grammar for growth and complexity.
