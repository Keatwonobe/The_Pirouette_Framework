In expanded form:

[\partial_t (T_a \omega_k) + \nabla \cdot (\Gamma \nabla C) = 0]

This universal form links temporal adherence (persistence), spatial coherence (order), and resonance pressure (interaction density). It provides the mathematical backbone for the **Triadic Resonance Equation** later formalized in COG-RES-001.
