In this framework, electric charge is not a substance a particle possesses, but an intrinsic bias in how its Temporal Coherence (K_τ) interacts with the phase of its environment. A charged particle's Lagrangian is asymmetric.

Positive Charge (Crest-Leading): Defined as a system whose coherence, K_τ, is maximized by interacting with environments of in-phase temporal rhythms. It seeks constructive interference.

Negative Charge (Trough-Leading): Defined as a system whose coherence, K_τ, is maximized by interacting with environments of out-of-phase temporal rhythms. It seeks destructive interference to maintain its internal stability.

This immediately explains electrostatic attraction and repulsion without invoking a force. Two positive charges, placed near each other, create an environment of intense in-phase resonance. To maximize their individual coherence, they will naturally move apart, seeking regions where that resonant pressure is lower. Their repulsion is a flight towards greater internal stability. Likewise, a positive and negative charge will move towards each other, as doing so allows each to satisfy its intrinsic coherence-seeking drive.
