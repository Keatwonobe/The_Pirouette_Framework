The old framework used disparate equations to model decay. The new model unifies them, grounding the rate of decay in the fundamental tension between signal and noise.

The characteristic lifetime of a fade, `τ_fade`, is directly proportional to the system's internal coherence and inversely proportional to the external temporal pressure it endures.
$$ \tau_{fade} \propto \frac{\text{Internal Coherence (Kτ)}}{\text{External Pressure (Γ)}} $$

This relationship is more precisely defined by the **Pirouette Coherence Lifetime** equation:
$$ \tau_{fade} = \tau_0 \cdot \left[ \frac{T_a}{1 - T_a} \right] \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma} $$
-   `τ_0` is a baseline time constant specific to the system's scale and medium.
-   `T_a / (1 - T_a)` is the **resilience term**. As a system's internal Temporal Coherence (`T_a`) approaches perfection (1), its lifetime approaches infinity, highlighting the profound power of internal order.
-   `1 / Γ` is the **environmental term**, showing that lifetime is inversely proportional to the ambient Temporal Pressure.

With this, the decay of a system's coherence `K` from an initial state `K₀` is modeled as:
$$ K(t) = K_0 \cdot e^{-t/\tau_{fade}} $$

In cases where a system "rings like a bell" as it fades, the model can be augmented to include the audible signature of the underlying `Ki` pattern fighting to re-establish itself.
$$ K(t) = K_0 \cdot e^{-t/\tau_{fade}} \left(1 + \alpha \cos(\omega_k t + \phi)\right) $$
-   `ω_k` is the system's fundamental resonant frequency.
-   `α` is the amplitude of its final "ringing."
-   `ϕ` is the phase offset of the oscillation.
