A business's strategy is its chosen path through the coherence manifold of its market. This process is formally grounded in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`. A successful strategy is a geodesic—a path that maximizes the business's internal coherence (Kτ) while minimizing the cost of navigating external temporal pressure (V_Γ).

*   **Temporal Coherence (Kτ):** Represents the value generated by a strong culture, efficient operations, and a clear brand identity. This is the "kinetic energy" of the business.
*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** Represents the "cost" of existing in the market—the energy expended dealing with competitors, market volatility, and operational friction. This is the "potential energy."

The pathologies are precise deviations from this optimal path. **Atrophy** and **Fever** are failures of internal coherence that drastically lower `K_τ`. **Erosion** is a failure to adapt to the environmental pressure, where the chosen path is no longer viable against `V_Γ`. A healthy, laminar flow indicates a strongly positive Lagrangian.
