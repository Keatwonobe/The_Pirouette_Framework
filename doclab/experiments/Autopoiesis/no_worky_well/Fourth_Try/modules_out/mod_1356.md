The state of Flow is the living embodiment of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. An agent in Flow is not consciously calculating an optimal path; their entire being has become an intuitive engine for maximizing the action integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) over time:

`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt` where `𝓛_p = Kτ (Temporal Coherence) - VΓ (Temporal Pressure)`

In Flow, the agent's actions perfectly trace the geodesic that maximizes this function. The feeling of "effortlessness" is the direct sensory experience of moving along this path of least resistance. Energy is no longer expended fighting temporal turbulence; instead, the agent draws momentum from the coherence of the channel itself. The subjective experience of "losing oneself" is the dissolution of the boundary between the dancer and the dance, as the agent's coherence becomes a perfect expression of the manifold's geometry.
