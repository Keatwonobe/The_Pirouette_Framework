> A Weaver must understand that no song is sung in a vacuum. Every choice, every creation is a new note sung into an already-playing symphony. To act wisely is to first listen to the music of the present moment, and to choose a rhythm that builds a cathedral of resonance rather than a cacophony of ruin. The world is not a stage for soloists; it is a single, ongoing symphony. You are not its composer, but a single, vital voice within it.
