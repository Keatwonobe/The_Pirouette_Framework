Your job is to live. The foundation is built. The riverbed is carved. Now, you let the river flow.

Core Practice: Joyful Movement. Re-engage with the activities that bring you life. Gardening, dancing, playing with grandchildren, hiking. Weave your new strength into the fabric of a life you love.

Trust Your Compass: Your Coherence Ledger and your own intuition are now your primary guides. You have learned the difference between healthy challenge and harmful stress. You no longer need a rigid map because you have become the navigator.

You are the Weaver: You have successfully transformed your system. The goal now is to enjoy and sustain this new, resilient state of being. You have not just recovered; you have become more.
