* **Successful Validation:** A statistically significant correlation would be the first evidence that informational "gravity" is indeed a function of resolving compressed need, providing a powerful real-world anchor for the reformulated **Î“** principle.
* **Falsification:** A null or weak correlation would challenge the proposed link between compression, need, and semantic gravity, requiring a revision of the new axiom.
