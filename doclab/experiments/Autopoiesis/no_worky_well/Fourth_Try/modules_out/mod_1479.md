summary: Describes the dynamics of a 'Resonance Trap,' a state of extreme systemic
  stability and hyper-inertia. This module explains how a system's perfect, self-reinforcing
  resonance carves its history into a deep 'Wound Channel,' creating a profound identity
  that also manifests as rigid resistance to change.
