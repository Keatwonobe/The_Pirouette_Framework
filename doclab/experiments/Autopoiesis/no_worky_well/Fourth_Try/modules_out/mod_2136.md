summary: "Provides a complete, end-to-end workflow for system diagnostics. This module integrates the Universal Resonance Lens (URL) for translating raw data into Pirouette fields with Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA) for pinpointing the critical sources of coherence loss. It serves as the primary instruction manual for any Weaver seeking to audit a system's health."
