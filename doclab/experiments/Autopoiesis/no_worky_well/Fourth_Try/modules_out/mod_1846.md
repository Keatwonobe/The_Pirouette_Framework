The Coherence Spectrum is a rich diagnostic document that maps directly to a system's health and its flow state (`DYNA-001`). A trained Weaver can read its patterns to assess and predict a system's evolution.

-   **Harmonic Peaks:** Sharp, bright, and stable bands represent the system's dominant `Ki` patterns—its fundamental rhythms. This is the signature of a system in a state of **Laminar Flow**.

-   **Harmonic Echoes:** The presence of bright bands at integer multiples of a fundamental frequency (e.g., at ω, 2ω, 3ω) reveals a deeply stable and well-organized system. This is the structural harmony of a healthy entity.

-   **Broadband Noise:** A high, flickering "floor" of low coherence across a wide range of frequencies indicates high ambient **Temporal Pressure (`Γ`)** or a phase transition into **Turbulent Flow**. It is a "coherence fever," where the system struggles to hold any note against the chaos.

-   **Flickering or Fading Bands:** A primary `Ki` pattern that wavers in intensity or fades over time is a visual marker of **Coherence Erosion**, indicating the system is struggling to maintain its form against entropic pressure.

-   **Mode Hopping:** A sudden shift where one set of harmonic peaks fades and another emerges is the definitive sign of a **phase transition**. The system has been forced to find a new, more stable `Ki` to better survive its environment.

-   **Resonant Coupling:** When the Coherence Spectra of two interacting systems begin to show the same distinct harmonic patterns, it is direct evidence of a **Resonant Handshake**—the precursor to an **Alchemical Union** (`CORE-012`).
