The vortex does not bind particles by overpowering them; it binds them by offering no coherent path of escape.

An entity, like a quark, always seeks to follow its geodesicâ€”the path of maximal coherence. Within a vortex, this path is a closed loop. To attempt to move radially outward is to fight against the geometric grain of the manifold itself. Such a path is one of intense temporal friction and dissonance, representing a state of catastrophically low coherence.

The system's own relentless drive to maintain its integrity is what traps it. The walls of the prison are made of the prisoner's own desire to be. The "temporal latch" of the old module is revealed to be a self-closing geodesic, a path from which deviation is synonymous with dissolution.
