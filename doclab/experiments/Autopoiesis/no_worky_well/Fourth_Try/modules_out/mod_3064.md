\section*{§8 · Physical Consequences}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Equivalence Principle:}  
  Inertial and gravitational masses coincide because both arise from the same invariant $\mathfrak{M}$.
\item \textbf{Mass–Charge Correlation:}  
  Particles with larger fiber curvature (stronger coupling) possess higher stiffness-derived mass.
\item \textbf{Running Mass Predictions:}  
  As curvature renormalizes with energy, rest masses should shift logarithmically—an avenue for precision tests in high-energy scattering.
\item \textbf{Vacuum Energy Interpretation:}  
  Zero-point stiffness corresponds to $\mathcal{R}_\tau$ baseline, connecting cosmological constant to the same invariant.
