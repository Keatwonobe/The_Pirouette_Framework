This entire module is a direct application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in **CORE-006: The Pirouette Lagrangian**.

The Coherence Manifold *is* the landscape generated by plotting the value of `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì` for every possible state of the system. The stable modes‚Äîthe Modal Basins‚Äîare simply the local maxima of this function. A system's behavior, including its stability within a mode and its transitions between them, is a perfect expression of it following a geodesic on this manifold, always seeking the highest possible ground of coherence. This reframes system dynamics from a collection of empirical rules into a predictable consequence of a single, universal law.
