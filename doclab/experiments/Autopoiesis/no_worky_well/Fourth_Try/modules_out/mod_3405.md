* Keep (C_n) independent of ((\kappa,p,m_\Gamma)).
* Label any provisional (\delta C_n) with uncertainties.
* Mixed (\mathcal O(\alpha g_\ell^2)) two-loops are small; track them in (\delta a_\ell^{\rm rem}) for completeness.

> **One-line synthesis:** The grand fit exposes a tight island where the muon is matched, the electron is naturally safe by decoupling, and the tau is predicted—turning “wound channel” into a crisp, testable prior.
