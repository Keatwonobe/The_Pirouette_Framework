Using the `Fractal Bridge` (CORE-014), we map the universal principles of the framework onto the specific domain of geopolitics. The old "Migration Potential Field" is thus reborn as a dynamic coherence manifold, shaped by two primary forces:

*   **Coherence (Kτ) as Opportunity and Resonance:** This is the "gravity well" of belonging that pulls a population forward. It is the measure of a region's potential for a stable, meaningful life. Its dimensions are not just economic opportunity, but also physical safety, political freedom, cultural affinity, social trust, and a shared vision of the future. A region of high coherence is a place where life feels less like a struggle and more like a song.

*   **Temporal Pressure (Γ) as Adversity and Dissonance:** This is the chaotic energy that pushes a population to move. It is the volcanic force of war, the grinding friction of famine and poverty, the turbulent chaos of political collapse, and the slow, inexorable pressure of climate change. A region with high Temporal Pressure is one where the daily act of existing requires immense energy simply to avoid falling apart.

A population does not calculate these factors consciously; it *feels* the gradient. The collective urge to migrate is the felt sense of a steeper, more favorable path towards coherence elsewhere.
