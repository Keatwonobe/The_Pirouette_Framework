Treat (\mathcal L) as the leading terms of an EFT with cutoff (\Lambda_\text{UV}). Counterterms allowed by symmetries are included. Predictivity is restored by a finite set of renormalized parameters at any fixed order. Power-counting organizes loops; higher-dimension operators are suppressed by (\Lambda_\text{UV}^{-n}).
