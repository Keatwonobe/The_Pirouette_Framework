A law is not a command; it is the shape of the riverbed that guides the water.

The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) provides the fundamental law of motion for the framework: `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. It states that a system will always evolve to maximize its internal coherence (`K_τ`) while minimizing the "cost" imposed by its environment's temporal pressure (`V_Γ`).

This is a powerful statement of principle, but it leaves the block uncarved. `K_τ` is the music the system plays—its own internal drive toward rhythmic being, maximized by its Time Adherence (`T_a`). But what of the landscape itself? The Temporal Pressure term, `V_Γ`, was left as an abstract function. To move from philosophy to physics, we must derive the precise shape of this landscape not from observation or curve-fitting, but from the non-negotiable requirements for a resonant "thing" to exist at all.
