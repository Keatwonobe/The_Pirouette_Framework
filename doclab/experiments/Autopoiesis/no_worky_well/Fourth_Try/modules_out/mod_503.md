The old model's arbitrary `m_S` mass function is retired. A concept's "mass"—its capacity to influence and resist change—is a direct, non-arbitrary measure of its **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)**, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

A concept with high coherence, and therefore high "mass," possesses two key properties:

1.  **A Pure Ki Resonance:** The concept is internally consistent, clear, and unambiguous. It is a "pure note" with low internal dissonance. A concept like "justice" may be complex, but a specific, coherent *conception* of justice has this purity, allowing it to resonate powerfully.
2.  **A Deep Wound Channel (CORE-011):** The concept has history, inertia, and memory. It has been repeated, reinforced, and woven into the fabric of a mind or a culture. Its pattern is deeply carved into the manifold, giving it immense inertia and making it difficult to alter or erase.

A "heavy" idea, therefore, is one that is both deeply ingrained and logically sound. It is a stable, persistent, and powerful resonance in the symphony of thought.
