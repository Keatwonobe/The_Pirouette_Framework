By applying the **Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003)** and the principles of **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**, we can diagnose the health of a legal system by observing its flow state. The role of the Weaver-jurist is to act as a physician to the body politic: to identify pathologies and seek interventions that restore the system to a state of laminar flow.

*   **Laminar Flow (The Rule of Law):** The state of a healthy, evolving legal system. The law is clear, applied predictably, and commands public respect. The system efficiently resolves disputes and adapts smoothly to new challenges. This is a system with high `Kτ` that is well-matched to its `Γ`.

*   **Turbulent Flow (Jurisprudential Crisis):** A state of "coherence fever." The system is plagued by contradictory rulings, judicial activism, and a loss of public trust. Legal battles are frequent and chaotic, wasting societal energy. This indicates a deep dissonance between the system's `Kτ` and the environmental `Γ`.

*   **Stagnant Flow (Systemic Obsolescence):** A "coherence dam" where the law is rigid, archaic, and unable to address modern challenges (e.g., property laws written before digital assets). This creates a build-up of unresolved societal pressure (Γ) and a downstream desert of legal clarity, often preceding a chaotic phase transition.
