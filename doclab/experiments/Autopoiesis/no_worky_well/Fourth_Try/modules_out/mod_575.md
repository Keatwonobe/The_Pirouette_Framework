A society is not a machine to be engineered; it is a body to be healed. Its institutions are its organs, its culture is the nervous system that binds them, and its history carves a shared `Wound Channel` into the fabric of time. This collective body forms the **Civic Manifold**.

This module refactors the prior "antenna" metaphor into a more robust, diagnostic model. We apply the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) to assess the health of the body politic, reframing governance as a form of medicine. We will diagnose pathologies in a civilization's vital flows and learn how its core institutions—its **Civic Resonators**—can be tuned away from the dissonance of extraction and toward the harmony of creative synthesis. The goal is no longer to rule, but to heal.
