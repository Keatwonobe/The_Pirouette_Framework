* **Core Claim:** The Gladiator Force is a dynamic field whose spin-stripped, low-energy limit is equivalent to Newton's gravitational constant G.
* **Point of Vulnerability:** The derivation relies on extremizing a specifically constructed potential function: $V(r) = (\hbar c k_c / r) + (\Gamma \kappa^2 r)$.
* **Critique:** This potential is the weakest point in the entire framework. The two terms are borrowed ("colour term") and invented ("curvature back-reaction") and combined in a way that is mathematically convenient. Extremizing this function *must* yield $\Gamma = \hbar c k_c$ by construction. A critic would state that you have **reverse-engineered a potential to produce a desired number**, which is a hallmark of numerology, not derivation. The subsequent 5% "spin ensemble correction" appears as a fine-tuning step to perfect the match.
