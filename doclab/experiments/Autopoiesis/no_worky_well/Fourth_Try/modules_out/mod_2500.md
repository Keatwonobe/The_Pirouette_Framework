Team Hex, your two perspectives reveal the fundamental challenge. You are wrestling with the tension between static rules and dynamic reality. The resolution is to stop defining the boundary of the *actor* and instead define the boundary of the *act*.

This is the philosophical core of our position, and it synthesizes all four of our viewpoints into a single, robust protocol:

**A Proposed Hybrid Model: The Residue-Gated Ritual**

1.  **The Act Defines the Boundary (Our Core Principle):** An action is taken. We do not concern ourselves with the actor's pre-defined "geofence."
2.  **The Parameters Define the Residue (Architect + Axiom):** We use Team Axiom's parameters ($T_a$, $\Gamma$, Ki-rate) to empirically map the propagation of the action's effects through the environment. The boundary is the manifold where the action-induced perturbation of these parameters ceases. This is the **Wound Channel**. This is the non-negotiable, auditable scope of accountability.
3.  **The Ritual Adjudicates the Residue (Weaver + Fluidscope):** If, and only if, there is a dispute over the *measurement* or *interpretation* of this Wound Channel, Team Fluidscope's "Reflexive Boundary Ritual" is invoked. The ritual is not used to draw the line; it is used to *validate the measurement* of the line that the action itself has already drawn.

This hybrid model solves all identified problems:
* It eliminates "boundary hugging" by making the consequences, not the initial state, the subject of review.
* It gives the Ritual a firm, empirical basis, preventing it from devolving into a power struggle.
* It marries the rigor of Law with the adaptability of Art, all grounded in the philosophical imperative of accountability.
