* [DOMA-096] formalizes (\Theta) as the pivot variable in the Caduceus Lens, unifying laminar and turbulent coherence.
* [SOCIO-POLICY-001] establishes governance principles derived from (\Theta)-based monitoring.
* [MATH-025] will derive scaling exponents for (\Theta)-criticality, confirming the universal resonance class.
