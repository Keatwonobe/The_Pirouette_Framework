Summary: "Purpose
Derive the functional form P(X)=α X^{1+β}+… for the superfluid Pressuron from first principles—no post‑hoc fitting—by imposing symmetry, scale covariance, and a discrete self‑similar (fractal) structure of temporal coherence channels. This module **fixes β** (and therefore the EOS) from geometry and dynamics, satisfying MATH‑018 D2.

Executive result
β = D_eff / z
where D_eff is the **effective (possibly fractal) spatial dimension** of the active coherence network (wound channels) and z is the dynamical exponent of the superfluid sector. In 3D spacetime with nonrelativistic superfluid scaling z=2 and plateaus D_eff∈{0,1,2}, one obtains β∈{0, 1/2, 1}—exactly the rational set allowed in SECT‑Γ‑A. No calibration needed."
