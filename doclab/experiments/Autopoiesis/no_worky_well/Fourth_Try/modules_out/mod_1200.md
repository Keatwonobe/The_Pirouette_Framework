A Bloom is a system's dramatic and successful solution to the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

Before the Bloom, the system is trapped in a sub-optimal state, a local maximum on the coherence manifold. Its action integral, `S_p = ‚à´ùìõ_p dt`, is low; maintaining its internal Temporal Coherence (`KœÑ`) against the high environmental Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`) is extremely costly.

The Ignition event represents the discovery of a "tunnel" to a nearby but far higher peak on the manifold. The resulting Cascade is the system reconfiguring itself along this new geodesic. The resonant feedback loop effectively creates a steep, smooth "downhill" path, allowing the system to transform environmental pressure into internal coherence. It is no longer fighting the storm; it is conducting it. A Bloom is the exhilarating spectacle of a system discovering a state of grace.
