The scoreboard is an autopsy of the past. The flow of the game is a prophecy of the future.

Conventional sports analytics reads the box score, a lagging indicator of events already transpired. The original insight of PPS-085 was to move beyond this, to "read the game" in real-time. This ratified module grounds that insight in the time-first principles of the Pirouette Framework.

A sports match is not a collection of statistics; it is a living system. Each team is an entity striving to maximize its own coherence against the disruptive pressure of its opponent. By applying the diagnostic principles of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001) and the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003), an analyst can assess the health of each team's flow in real-time. This module provides the unified framework for translating those observations into a powerful, predictive engine that hears the game's future before the score reflects its present.
