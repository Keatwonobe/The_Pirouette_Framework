The Coherence Deficit (`ΔK_τ`) is a time-series that measures the shortfall or surplus of a system's expressed Temporal Coherence relative to a model's prediction.

**ΔK_τ(t) = K_τ_obs(t) − K_τ_pred(t)**

Where:
*   **`K_τ_obs(t)`** is the actual, measured coherence of the system at time `t`, derived from real-world data—the truth of the territory.
*   **`K_τ_pred(t)`** is the coherence the system *would have* exhibited if it had perfectly followed the geodesic dictated by the model's hypothesized Lagrangian, `𝓛̂_model`.

The sign of a persistent deficit is a critical diagnostic indicator:

-   A **negative deficit (`ΔK_τ < 0`)** indicates an unmodeled source of Temporal Pressure or friction. The system is struggling more than the model can account for. This is a **Coherence Leak**.

-   A **positive deficit (`ΔK_τ > 0`)** indicates an unmodeled source of coherence or efficiency. The system is succeeding in ways the model cannot explain. This is a **Coherence Spring**.
