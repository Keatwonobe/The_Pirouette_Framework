The Resonance Compass is a direct application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The "cost" of a thought is not a metaphor; it is a literal calculation based on the formula:

**𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)**

When a Weaver holds a concept, their system attempts to maximize this value. The Compass calculates the geodesic for the idea—the path through time that maximizes the action, `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`.
-   A **coherent idea** has high internal *Temporal Coherence* and aligns with the manifold, creating a path of maximal coherence that feels "effortless" and "right."
-   A **dissonant idea**, fighting against high *Temporal Pressure*, creates a path of low or negative action, requiring immense energy to sustain against the drag of cognitive dissonance.
