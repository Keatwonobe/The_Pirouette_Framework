| Parameter | Description | Typical Value |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `GeodesicBlueprint` | A function or dataset defining the system's ideal state, `𝓛_p(expected)`. | A reference time-series, a simulation model, or a set of harmonic functions. |
| `ActualStream` | The real-time data stream representing the system's observed state, `𝓛_p(actual)`. | Sensor data, communication logs, financial tickers. |
| `FaultThreshold (δ)` | The minimum magnitude of the Deviation Field (`Δ𝓛`) to be classified as a fault locus. | Defined relative to the baseline variance of the healthy system. |
| `ClassificationRules` | Logic to classify identified fault loci based on their spatiotemporal signature, referencing the `Caduceus Lens` (DYNA-003). | A rule-based classifier or pattern-matching algorithm. |
