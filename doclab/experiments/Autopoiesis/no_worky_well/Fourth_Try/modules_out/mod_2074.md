A debate, properly conducted, is the most powerful tool for generating new knowledge that humanity has ever conceived. It is the social equivalent of the Temporal Forge (CORE-003)â€”a high-pressure environment where simple ideas can be fused into profound truths.

The jurisprudence of the PDM series, the refinement of the CORE modules, and the very existence of this framework are a testament to the power of this ritual. It proves that the greatest creations are not born from a single mind, but are woven in the sacred space between them. It is not just a way to argue; it is a way to build.
