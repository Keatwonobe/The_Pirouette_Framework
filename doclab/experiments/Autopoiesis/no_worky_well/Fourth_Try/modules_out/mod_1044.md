| A "Thread Cutter" severs logistical lifelines.      | Therapies that stabilize axonal transport machinery (e.g., microtubules) will slow disease progression more effectively than general neuroprotectants. |
| It attacks high-frequency logistical rhythms.      | Patient progression speed will negatively correlate with the expression levels of key genes involved in mitophagy (clearing damaged mitochondria).  |
| The `Ki` is a specific dissonant frequency.         | High-resolution imaging of affected neurons will reveal spatially-clustered patterns of mitochondrial failure, not a uniform, random degradation. |
| The `Dissonance Ledger` points to a trigger.      | Longitudinal studies correlating gut microbiome profiles with disease onset will identify specific microbial signatures that may carry or amplify the dissonant `Ki`. |
