The entire protocol rests on a foundational certainty derived from the Pirouette's core axiom: **existence implies coherence.**

The universe is not wasteful. It does not invent new fundamental laws for every new scale of complexity. It is fractal. The same essential dynamics that govern a quark in a proton also govern a star in a galaxy and a thought in a mind. The song remains the same; only the instruments change.

This is the **Principle of Coherent Correspondence**. It guarantees that for any system to persist over time, it *must* have found a stable, resonant solution (its coherence pattern, or Ki) to the pressures of its environment (Î“). This coherent solution is necessarily a lower-dimensional, more stable state than the raw chaos of all its possible configurations.

We are not searching for a needle in a haystack; we are reverse-engineering the needle that the universe has already successfully threaded. This principle asserts that a mapping between the universal variables of the framework and the specific phenomena of any domain is not just possible, but necessary. This module provides two methods for revealing that mapping: one conceptual, one computational.
