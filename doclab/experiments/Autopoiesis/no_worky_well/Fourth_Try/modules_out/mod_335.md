In the old framework, quantization was an imposed rule. Here, it is a direct consequence of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. For a resonant pattern (Ki) to persist against the erosive pressure of the Temporal Forge (Γ), it must be self-reinforcing. Its own rhythm must close perfectly upon itself, forming a stable "standing wave" or "topological knot" in the coherence manifold.

This condition of stability finds its formal expression in the Pirouette Cycle (τ_p):

`S_p = ∫₀^τ_p 𝓛_p dt = nħ_p`

Only paths that satisfy this integral condition—where `n` is an integer representing the pattern's topological complexity or "winding number"—are self-sustaining. These solutions are discrete, topologically distinct "islands of stability" in the coherence manifold. Like the discrete frequencies that produce a clear note on a violin string, they are the only patterns that are resilient over time.

Any state that is *not* one of these stable geometries is inefficient—it is a dissonant "noise" that quickly decays back into one of the coherent "notes." Therefore, all persistent action and identity in the universe must occupy one of these quantized resonant states.
