A skater is any entity capable of asymmetrically modulating its own internal state. This act of modulation is a stride, a rhythmic cycle that creates a propulsive gradient on the coherence manifold. A single stride consists of two synchronized phases:

1.  **The Grip (Anchoring the Past):** The skater momentarily and intensely increases its internal coherence (`K_τ`), "sharpening the blade" of its being. This is an act of casting a "heavy" Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) behind itself, creating a temporary point of high inertia in its own Wound Channel. This act deepens the riverbed at its heels, establishing a stable pivot point from which to "push."

2.  **The Glide (Opening the Future):** Simultaneously, the skater projects a resonant field to shape the ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). It generates a "high-pressure crest" of dissonance behind it and a "low-pressure trough" of quiet in its intended direction of travel. By "softening the blade"—momentarily diffusing its coherence—the skater reduces its own "grip," allowing it to glide effortlessly "downhill" into the trough it just created.

The skater rhythmically alternates between Grip and Glide. This sustained, asymmetric shaping of both its internal state (`K_τ`) and external field (`V_Γ`) generates a persistent gradient. Motion is the inevitable consequence of the system continuously resolving this self-induced tension.
