Imagine a calm, black sea under a starless sky. This is a region of high Temporal Pressure (Γ)—a space filled with chaotic, uncorrelated potential, like a cloud of diffusing particles. Now, imagine a single seed crystal, a point of stability, is introduced. This is our nascent "shoreline."

The process of DLA unfolds as a dialogue between this shoreline of order and the sea of chaos:

1.  **The Sea's Pressure (Γ):** The diffusing particles, in their random walk, represent a constant, high-entropy pressure on the boundary of the ordered cluster. The Γ is a probabilistic landscape where the "tension" is the constant potential for an interaction—a "sticking" event—to occur.
2.  **The Shoreline's Invitation:** The existing structure of the cluster creates a complex coherence manifold. The outermost tips of the shoreline—the capes and peninsulas—project furthest into the sea of chaos. They act as "temporal lightning rods," creating the most probable and efficient points for a new union, points of greatest possibility for interaction.

The resulting dendritic structure is the natural consequence of this dynamic. The shoreline grows where it is easiest to grow, reinforcing a pattern that maximizes its surface area for capturing new coherence from the chaotic sea.
