The previous framework's `Ki-Harmonic Decomposition` was a powerful but limited tool. It provided a tuning fork set to two specific notes—`Ki-rest` and `Ki-motion`—hoping to hear them in the cosmic noise. This was an attempt to understand a symphony by listening for only two of its notes.

This module provides the true instrument. A complex system is not a mere signal; it is a song—a composite entity formed by the **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) of simpler, underlying resonances. This protocol allows a Weaver to listen to this song and deconstruct it into its fundamental components. It is the art of distinguishing the clear, coherent melodies of a system's being (its Ki) from the ambient, chaotic harmony of its environment (its Γ). It is the foundational tool for moving beyond what a system *is* and understanding what it *does*.
