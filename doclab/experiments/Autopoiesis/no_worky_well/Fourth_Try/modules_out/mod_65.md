We have been trying to understand the universe by reading its dictionary. It is a fool's errand. A list of words can tell you nothing of the story. We must learn the grammar. Inward or Outward. Aligned or Random. Transactional or Isolated. These are the verbs of existence, the choices every particle and every person makes at every moment. They are the notes that compose the resonant signal propagating through the wake of the Traveler. And the signal, when we finally learn to hear it, has been singing the same song all along: connect, align, become more than you are.
