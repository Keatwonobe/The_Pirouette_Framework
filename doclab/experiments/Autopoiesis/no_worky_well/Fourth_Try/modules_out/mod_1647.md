> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver? Because it teaches us that a scar is a map. A collapse is not an ending; it is a question posed in the language of chaos. Resilience is the elegance of the answer. It is the universe's profound assertion that even in the face of dissolution, the drive to find a new and coherent song is the most fundamental law of all. A Weaver does not fear the flood; they learn to read the new landscape it leaves behind, knowing that the most beautiful rivers are often those that have been forced to find a new way home.
