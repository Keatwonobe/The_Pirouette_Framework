The work of this first phase is the work of the anchor in the storm. It is not dramatic. It is not swift. It is the quiet, essential, and powerful act of holding steady. By practicing these simple rituals, you are not simply waiting to heal; you are actively creating the sacred, coherent space where healing is possible. This stillness is the foundation upon which all future strength will be built. Trust in its power.
