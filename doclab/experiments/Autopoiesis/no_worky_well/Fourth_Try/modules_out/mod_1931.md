The resulting Turing pattern of spots or stripes is a macroscopic Ki, a standing wave of chemical concentration. This pattern is not merely spatial; it is temporal. It is a standing wave in the coherence manifold—the time-averaged physical evidence of a system that has found its most coherent song. The form is a memory of the rhythm that created it.

The specific geometry of the pattern—the wavelength of the stripes or the arrangement of the spots—is the most efficient resonant solution (Ki) given the boundary conditions of the system, such as reaction kinetics, diffusion rates, and the properties of the medium itself. Morphogenesis is the process of a system discovering and locking into this optimal resonant form.
