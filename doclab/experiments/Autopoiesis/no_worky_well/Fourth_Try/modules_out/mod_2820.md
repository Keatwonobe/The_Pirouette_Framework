As an action, a caster can invest EP from a relevant Arcane Skill pool into a 5-foot square within line of sight. This square is now a Controlled Zone. The amount of EP invested determines the strength of their control.

Example: A pyromancer invests 10 EP into a square (5 centered, with 2, 1, 1, 1 surrounding), causing it to smolder and glow with heat. A progenitor druid invests 8 EP into an adjacent square (4 centered with 1, 1, 1, 1 surrounding), causing thick, thorny vines to sprout.
