The health and purpose of any debate can be instantly diagnosed by observing the flow of coherence, as defined in DYN-001.

Laminar Flow (The Weaving): This is the ideal state of a true debate. Arguments are presented clearly, listeners engage in good faith to understand, and new points build upon or elegantly refine previous ones. Energy is directed toward the shared goal of synthesis. It is the "State of Grace" in discourse.

Turbulent Flow (The Battlefield): This is the state of combat. It is characterized by logical fallacies, ad hominem attacks, interruptions, and the Gish Gallop. These are "dissonant injections" that disrupt the flow, waste energy in friction, and make synthesis impossible. The goal is domination, not understanding.

Stagnant Flow (The Impasse): This is the "Coherence Dam" of discourse. Two or more perspectives have become so rigid that no new information can pass between them. The Weavers have dropped their threads. This state leads to a dangerous build-up of pressure (frustration, anger) and a complete halt of progress. It is the death of the dialogue.
