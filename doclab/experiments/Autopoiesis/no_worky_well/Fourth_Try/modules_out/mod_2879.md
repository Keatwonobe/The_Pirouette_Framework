An environmental hazard or mechanical trap is the simplest form of challenge: a single, non-regenerating pool of Entropy designed to be spent once.

Mechanic: The hazard's Entropic Budget is its total damage potential. When triggered, it unleashes its full EB as an "attack." Players in the area of effect must use Active Defense (TLE-005) to block the incoming entropic force. Once its budget is spent, the trap is inert.

Example: A 25 EP Fire Trap. When triggered, it attacks everyone in a 10-foot radius with 25 entropic force. A character must spend 25 EP on Active Defense to negate the damage entirely. The trap is now disarmed.
