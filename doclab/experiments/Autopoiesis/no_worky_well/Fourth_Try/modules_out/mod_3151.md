1. **Mandrel prep**
   Tape the threaded rod vertically at the *centre* of the record-player platter.
   The thread’s lead equals its circumference over *one full turn*, so feeding the fibre through the nut while the platter rotates automatically forces pitch $p = 2\pi R$.

2. **Wind $N$ turns**
   – Switch the turntable *by hand* (motor off) and let the nut climb the rod.
   – Keep the fibre loose (no micro-bending) and tape each loop so it cannot slip.
   – For first trials set $N = 5$; length ≈ 5 × (2πR) ≈ 0.8 m (R = 25 mm).

> **Check-point:** hold a ruler: vertical rise per loop ≈ circumference. That’s your critical 45° helix.
