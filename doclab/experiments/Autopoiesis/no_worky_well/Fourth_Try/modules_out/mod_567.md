The Nomad's Grammar (CORE-002) provides the language for this derivation. It describes the interactive posture of any system along the axis of **Communion**, which ranges from the **Isolated Pole** to the **Transactional Pole**.

*   **The Isolated Pole (The Fortress):** The system favors self-containment, repelling outside influence. It must bear the full cost of resisting ambient Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) by itself. Its potential to increase its internal coherence (Kτ) is strictly limited by its own resources. It is a fortress built on sand.

*   **The Transactional Pole (The Weaver):** The system favors exchange, bonding, and resonance. It actively seeks to engage in the Alchemical Union (CORE-012), the process of merging with other systems to form a new, higher-order entity with a more complex and stable Ki pattern. Altruism, in this physical context, is the behavioral posture that most efficiently lowers the activation energy required for a Resonant Handshake and a successful Alchemical Union.
