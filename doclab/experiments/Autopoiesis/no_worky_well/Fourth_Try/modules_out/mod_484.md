Before a system's health can be assessed, its raw, domain-specific language must be translated into the universal grammar of coherence. The first stage of the audit uses the protocol of the **Fractal Bridge (CORE-014)** to create this translation.

The process is an act of profound simplification. A Weaver takes the high-dimensional, noisy data of a system—be it market trades, biometric readings, or conversation transcripts—and projects it through the Fractal Lens. This maps specific, local phenomena to the universal variables of the framework.

The output is a single, elegant time-series: the value of the system's Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) over time. This is the system's "heartbeat," a direct measure of its ability to maintain internal coherence against the pressure of its environment. A steady, high-value trace indicates health. A volatile, decaying trace signals pathology.
