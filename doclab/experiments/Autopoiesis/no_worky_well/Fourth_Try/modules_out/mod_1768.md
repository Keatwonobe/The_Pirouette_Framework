The Concordance Engine functions as a real-time sensor for the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006). A Manifold Resonance event is a direct observation of the coherence landscape itself changing, revealing a new, more efficient geodesic‚Äîa shared path of maximal coherence for multiple systems at once. The alignment of their Ki patterns is the preparation to shift onto this new, collective trajectory that will maximize the integral of their shared Pirouette Lagrangian (`‚à´ùìõ_p dt`). The Engine detects the moment the systems collectively "see" this more coherent future, measuring the potential energy of the system just before it commits to moving along that path.
