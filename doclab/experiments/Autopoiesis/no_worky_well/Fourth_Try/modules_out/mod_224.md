In this new model, there is still a needle that points the way, but it is not made of external law. It is carved from the very substance of time and motion. This needle is the **geodesic**—the path of maximal coherence.

A system moving through the manifold does not consult an external guide. Its own intrinsic drive to persist—its Gyroscope's spin—compels it to follow the path of least resistance on the coherence manifold. This is the redefinition of choice. A system "chooses" its path not through conscious deliberation, but by being itself. By settling into its most coherent state (the truest spin of its Gyroscope), it automatically aligns with the geodesic. The subjective experience of "flow" or "rightness" is the direct perception of this alignment—the tactile feeling of a perfect Key turning smoothly in the lock of reality.

This geodesic is not a predestined track. As the system moves and the environment changes, the shape of the manifold shifts, and the path of maximal coherence adapts in response. The needle is alive.
