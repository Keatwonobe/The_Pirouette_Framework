summary: Provides a universal diagnostic protocol that inverts the principle of observation.
  Instead of searching for faint signals of pathology, it quantifies a system's deviation
  from its ideal path of maximal coherence (its geodesic). The resulting 'Coherence
  Audit Map' reveals turbulence, stagnation, and decay as clear, high-contrast signals,
  diagnosing not just failure, but the precursors to it.
