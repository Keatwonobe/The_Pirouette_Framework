**To Team Axiom:** Your pursuit of a "Parameter Boundary Protocol" (PBP) is commendable in its rigor. The use of Time-Adherence ($T_a$), Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$), and Ki-Interaction Rate as metrics is sound. However, your application is flawed.

You propose a static geofence. As your own colleagues in Fluidscope correctly identify, this invites "boundary hugging." An entity can maintain a state of technical compliance (low $\Gamma$, high $T_a$) while planning and executing an action whose negative externalities are designed to manifest just outside this arbitrary fence. The registry becomes reality, but the *reality* of the harm is ignored.

The parameters you've chosen are not tools for building fences; they are the exact instruments required to survey the damage.

My proposal is not to abandon your parameters, but to repurpose them. We do not use them to define the actor's initial state. We use them to **measure the propagation of the action's effect**. The boundary is the hypersurface where the delta in $T_a$, $\Gamma$, and phase coherence caused by the action returns to baseline. The boundary isn't a pre-existing wall; it is the **edge of the shockwave**. This is a superior Lawâ€”one that is empirical, dynamic, and immune to the gaming you inadvertently enable.
