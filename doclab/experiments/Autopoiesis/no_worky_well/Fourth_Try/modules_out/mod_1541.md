The phenomenon of high Resonant Gain is a direct consequence of the framework's dynamics. A manipulator does not create belief from nothing; they exploit a pre-existing vulnerability.

A managed narrative is a `Ki` pattern that has been deliberately shaped to align with a deep **Wound Channel (CORE-011)** in the collective psyche. This process makes the narrative exceptionally efficient at converting ambient temporal pressure into internal coherence. It represents a "path of least resistance" for belief.

Such a system exists in a state of high potential, poised on a "coherence cliff edge." The manipulative act—a **Daedalus Gambit (DYNA-003)**—is a minimal energy nudge (`δΓ_inj`) that pushes the system over this edge. The system then rapidly follows a steep geodesic toward a state of much higher coherence (`Kτ`), releasing a cascade of stored potential energy. The high Resonant Gain is the macroscopic signature of a system that was engineered for this precise, efficient state transition.
