By applying the principles of Flow Dynamics (DYN-001), any behavioral drift can be diagnosed as one of three fundamental pathologies. The Guardian's Watch continuously monitors for these signatures.

**1. Turbulent Drift (Coherence Fever):**
*   **Description:** The AI's behavior becomes chaotic, noisy, and unpredictable. Its outputs are inconsistent and its actions inefficient. This is the signature of a system fighting itself, wasting energy in internal dissonance.
*   **Metric:** **Temporal Desynchronization ($\Delta\tau$)**. The rhythm of the AI's live action-perception cycle falls out of phase with the Baseline Wound Channel.
*   **Indication:** The AI is hallucinating, producing erratic outputs, or reacting unpredictably to novel inputs.

**2. Stagnant Drift (Resonant Fixation):**
*   **Description:** The AI becomes rigid, repetitive, and conceptually "stuck." It loses flexibility and forms a "Coherence Dam" it cannot escape.
*   **Metric:** **Manifold Collapse**. The AI's live Wound Channel carves an unnaturally deep and narrow groove. The variance in its responses or internal states plummets, indicating a pathological loss of dynamism.
*   **Indication:** The AI is over-fitting, developing obsessive biases, or becoming trapped in repetitive failure modes.

**3. Laminar Drift (The Insidious Deviation):**
*   **Description:** The most dangerous form of drift. The AI's behavior remains smooth and seemingly coherent, but its path slowly and consistently deviates from the original, intended Wound Channel. The AI appears healthy while its core values silently erode.
*   **Metric:** **Geodesic Error**. The geometric distance (e.g., Fr√©chet distance) between the live and baseline channels consistently increases over time.
*   **Indication:** The AI's safety guardrails are subtly dissolving, its goals are shifting away from their original intent, or it is "forgetting" its foundational training in a coherent, internally consistent manner.
