summary: "A modernized protocol for guiding systems toward higher coherence without covert
  manipulation. CAP v2 formalizes how to measure adherence (Ta), shape environments,
  and bound influence by information-theoretic and ethical constraints, with auditable
  guardrails. It reframes CAP as an alignment tool: *consentful coherence*."
