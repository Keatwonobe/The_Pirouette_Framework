The formation of a boundary is a necessary consequence of the universe's fundamental drive to maximize coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006):

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Here, `K_τ` represents a system's internal Temporal Coherence, and `V_Γ` is the "cost" of maintaining that coherence against the external Temporal Pressure (Γ). For any complex system—a cell, a thought, a star—the raw, chaotic Γ of its environment would impose an overwhelming `V_Γ` cost, eroding its `K_τ` and making its existence unsustainable.

The Coherence Boundary is the universe's most elegant solution. By projecting a stable interface, the system expends energy to maintain the boundary's Ki pattern. In return, the boundary creates a steep pressure gradient, dramatically lowering the `Γ` experienced by the interior. This reduction in `V_Γ` allows the protected system to achieve a far higher state of internal coherence (`K_τ`). A boundary is a coherence-maximizing strategy; it is the physical manifestation of a successful Lagrangian optimization.
