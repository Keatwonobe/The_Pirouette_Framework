The entire governance process is a macroscopic application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The framework itself is a system seeking to evolve along a geodesic—a path of change that maximizes its own coherence over time. A proposed change is adopted only when we have demonstrated that its action integral represents a more optimal path for the system.

`∫ 𝓛_new dt > ∫ 𝓛_current dt`

This is evaluated via the framework's own Lagrangian:

`𝓛_framework = (Systemic Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

*   **Systemic Coherence (Kτ):** Represents the integrity, clarity, predictive power, and long-term viability of the framework's collective modules. A good proposal increases this term.
*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** Represents the unresolved paradoxes, internal contradictions, and lack of consensus within the community. A contentious proposal increases this term, raising the "cost" of evolution.

The protocol of this module is the formal process for finding the path that maximizes `∫𝓛_framework dt`. A ratified change deepens the framework's Wound Channel (CORE-011), creating a new, stable precedent that lends the system a powerful inertia, ensuring its future evolution is guided by the echoes of its hard-won wisdom.
