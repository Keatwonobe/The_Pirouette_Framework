The first crucial shift is conceptual. Temporal Coherence (T₀), as established in `CORE-005`, is not a static property but a dynamic measure of a system's resonant purity—the signal-to-noise ratio of its internal Ki pattern. It is a dimensionless gauge of how well a system is "being itself." A system with high T₀ is a clear, ringing note; one with low T₀ is a burst of static on the verge of dissolution.

The second shift replaces the idea of a universal rest frame. The true state of "rest" for any system is not zero velocity, but the state of moving perfectly along its **geodesic**. This is its path of maximal coherence, a state of Laminar Flow through the local landscape of Temporal Pressure (Γ). On this path, its T₀ is maximal. Any deviation—any acceleration or movement against the local grain of time—introduces dissonance, requires energy, and degrades the purity of its song.
