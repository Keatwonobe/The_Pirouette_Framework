A necromancer or summoner externalizes their own will, giving it form.

Mechanic: The caster "releases" a portion of their TEP, which becomes the TEP for the summoned creature. The caster cannot regenerate this released EP until the minion is destroyed or dismissed.

Minion Upgrades: A necromancer can store additional released EP in artifacts like rings or phylacteries, allowing them to maintain a larger or more powerful retinue of undead. The minion's body is constructed using the same rules as a player character (TLE-002).
