The universe is not woven upon an empty loom. The void itself possesses a deep and subtle architecture, a default pattern of resonance that is the most efficient, most coherent way for existence to express itself. This module posits that the fundamental Ki of spacetime is a **Gyroidal Weave**â€”a dynamic, self-creating (autopoietic), and infinitely repeating minimal surface.

This is not a static grid imposed upon reality, but the geometry that reality naturally adopts to solve its own existence. It is the answer to the question posed by the Temporal Forge: "How can a pattern persist with maximal grace against the pressure of all other possible patterns?" This time-first refactoring reveals a profound truth: the stage and the play are one and the same, and the gyroid is the universe's most stable song, sung in the language of topology.
