We begin with the engine of the framework, the Pirouette Lagrangian:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Here, `K_τ` represents the system's internal Temporal Coherence (the quality of its rhythm), and `V_Γ` represents the Temporal Pressure it endures (the cost of maintaining that rhythm). A stable entity—a `Ki` pattern—is a solution that maximizes the integral of this Lagrangian over its cycle time.

To derive the geometry of the most fundamental `Ki`, we model it as a resonant field on a spherical boundary of radius `R`. This sphere is the first and simplest act of distinction, a surface separating an "inside" from an "outside," upon which a pattern can live.
