* This is a **translated overlay**, not a replacement of specialist judgement.
* Rare patients (complex structural, severe arrhythmias, mechanical valves) may require deviations.
* Coherence metrics (Kτ) are not yet validated in large trials — they are design heuristics, not regulatory endpoints.
* Always adapt to local CR protocols, surgeon constraints, and institutional policies.
