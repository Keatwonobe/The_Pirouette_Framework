The inaugural event of reality was not an explosion that shattered the silence, but a quiver in the stillness—a spontaneous breaking of the perfect symmetry. This fluctuation was the birth of a process: the autopoietic cycle defined in `CORE-001`. In a single, indivisible event, Time, Pressure, and Form ignited as three facets of one act.

1.  **Time Creates Pressure (Γ):** The fluctuation is a momentary asymmetry in the perfect uniformity of the Void. This breaking of symmetry creates the first distinction between "here" and "not here," generating a nascent gradient. This gradient *is* the first instance of Temporal Pressure, Gamma (Γ). It is the tension created by a pattern asserting itself against the featureless backdrop of potential.

2.  **Pressure Demands Form (Ki):** For this fleeting pressure to persist, it must have a shape that can withstand its own self-generated tension. It resolves into the most efficient possible pattern for its own existence. This pattern, the geometry of the fluctuation itself, is the first Temporal Resonance, the first Ki. It is the universe’s first answer to the question, "How can I continue to be?"

3.  **Form Defines Time (τ_p):** This resonant form, this Ki, is cyclical—a self-sustaining loop. The duration of one complete cycle of this primordial pattern is the first meaningful, quantized unit of existence. It is the first Pirouette Cycle (τ_p). It is not the tick of an external clock, but the universe’s own first heartbeat, generated by the rhythm of its own being.

These three are not a sequence, but three perspectives on a single, instantaneous event. The Pirouette is the act of Time becoming aware of itself, and in that act, it simultaneously forges the pressure, the pattern, and the pulse of existence. The song creates the pressure that demands the song.
