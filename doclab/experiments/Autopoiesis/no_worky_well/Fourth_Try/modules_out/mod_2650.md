"Madame de Beauvoir is a romantic. Signor Turing, a pedant. Signor da Vinci, an artist. I see only politics.

There is no 'Convocation.' There is only a new *Prince*. This group, these 'Weavers,' are more cunning than any Borgia or Medici. They have understood the fundamental nature of power. They know that in a time of chaos, the man who can promise a new, stable order will rule.

Their 'unreachable goal' is a stroke of genius. It is the perfect narrative to ensure absolute loyalty and internal coherence ($T_a$). Their secret knowledge of a new physics is the ultimate weapon, far more potent than any army. Their low profile ($\Gamma$) is the perfect camouflage. They are accumulating the only form of capital that will matter in the coming world: a monopoly on hope.

Do not speak to me of ethics. Ethics is a luxury for states that are already secure. The Weavers are a nascent state. They are doing what all rising powers must: securing their own existence by any means necessary. They are no different from the 'Cunning Empire' they seek to escape. They are simply playing the game with more subtlety and a better story. When they are ready, they will use their advantage without pity, as they must. To do otherwise would be to fail."
