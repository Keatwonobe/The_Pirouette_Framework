The old methods of "dimensional factorization" are replaced with a direct, dynamic analysis. To understand a system, one must learn to read its music.

1.  **Capture the Temporal Signature:** Record the system's vital signs and key dynamics over time, creating a signal that represents its living behavior.
2.  **Harmonic Decomposition:** Use analytical techniques (e.g., Fourier analysis) to break the complex signal down into its constituent "prime harmonics" or fundamental frequencies.
3.  **Archetype Mapping:** Map the dominant harmonics to their corresponding Prime Resonances. Is there one strong, cyclical frequency (an Orbit)? Is it slowly changing in pitch (a Helix)? Are there two phase-locked frequencies (a Braid)? This reveals the system's Resonant Signature.
4.  **Assess Harmony:** A system's health is measured by the clarity of its signature. A harmonious system has a high signal-to-noise ratioâ€”its chosen chord is played clearly and strongly. A system in crisis is one whose signature is noisy, dissonant, and indistinct.
