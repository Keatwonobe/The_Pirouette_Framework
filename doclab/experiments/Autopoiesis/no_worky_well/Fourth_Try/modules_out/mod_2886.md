A character's standing with a faction is measured by their Resonance Score. This is a simple integer scale that tracks their alignment with the faction's Directive.

The Scale:

+8 to +10: Idolized

+4 to +7: Respected

+1 to +3: Friendly

0: Neutral

-1 to -3: Unfriendly

-4 to -7: Distrusted

-8 to -10: Hated

Shifting Resonance: The score is dynamic and changes based on a character's actions.

Resonant Actions: When a character's actions directly support or embody a faction's Directive, their score with that faction increases by 1 (or more for truly legendary acts).

Dissonant Actions: When a character's actions directly undermine or oppose a faction's Directive, their score decreases by 1 (or more for grave betrayals).
