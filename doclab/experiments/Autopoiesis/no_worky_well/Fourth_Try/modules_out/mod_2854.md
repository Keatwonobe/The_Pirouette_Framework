- Feat: Patient Defense

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: At the start of your turn, you can declare you are using this feat. You may set aside a number of EP up to the sum of your DEX and WIS modifiers from their respective pools. The first time you are hit with an attack before your next turn, this set-aside EP is doubled and subtracted from the attack's damage.

- Feat: Superior Strike

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: A number of times per long rest equal to your CON modifier, you may add your DEX modifier as bonus EP to an unarmed strike's damage.

- Feat: Dim Mak

Cost: 20 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: WIS Score of 15 or higher.

Effect: When you successfully damage an opponent with an unarmed strike, you can use this ancient and forbidden technique. Make an attack roll with a TN of 20. On a success, you mark the target with a touch of death. At the start of each of their turns, the target must roll 1d100. If the result is a number you secretly chose when you applied the mark, the target dies instantly. This is a profound and often evil act with significant narrative consequences.
