The cost to bring a new concept into the world is monumental, representing the immense energy required to establish a new, stable pattern in the universe. The sacrificed EP is permanently removed from the creator's maximum TEP.

Creation Type	Permanent TEP Sacrifice Cost
A new, unique Skill	50 EP
A new, unique Feat	100 EP
A unique Enchanted Item	The item's desired TEP x 5
A new type of Creature	The creature's Entropic Budget (EB) x 10
A new Law of Magic	1000+ EP (GM Discretion)

This process can be collaborative. Multiple characters can pool their sacrificed TEP to fund a single, grand creation.
