Poisons and venoms are like an item in that each has its own rules, but generic "venom" or "acme poison" would poison constitution directly, removing EP from it each round while poisoned. That means eventually ERR goes to 0 and death.

The Poisoned State: Some attacks do more than tear flesh; they corrupt the very essence of a being. A creature afflicted with the Poisoned state has had its entropic form compromised. At the end of its turn, a poisoned creature must make a Constitution check against the poison's potency. On a failure, they lose a specified amount of EP directly from their Constitution attribute pool, representing their body's struggle to maintain coherence. This loss reduces their Constitution Score and, consequently, their Entropy Regeneration Rate. If a creature's Constitution EP is reduced to 0, it perishes.

Mastering Potency (Alchemy): For those without a natural venom, poison is a craft to be mastered. By taking the Professional Aptitude (Alchemy) feat, a character can learn to brew toxins. The alchemist can invest additional TEP directly into their Alchemy skill beyond the initial feat investment. This invested EP represents their growing knowledge and serves as the dedicated pool from which they can enhance the potency of the poisons they create, making each dose more difficult to resist.

Mastering Potency (Biology): For some creatures, venom is not a craft; it is an extension of their own being. A character with a venomous Utility Limb (such as a stinger or fangs) can invest TEP directly into that limb's dedicated pool. This investment represents a biological optimization—a diet, meditative practice, or resonant focus—that refines and concentrates their natural toxins. The EP invested in the limb determines the potency of the venom it delivers.
