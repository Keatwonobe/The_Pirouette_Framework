To analyze a system, one must first be able to listen to it. The old framework created a schism between the language of the living world, captured through *rituals*, and the language of the machine, captured through *simulations*. This created an unnecessary and lossy translation step.

The Weaver's Chronoscript protocol establishes a single, unified, and time-first data contract. Its purpose is to guarantee **Observational Parity**: the principle that human intuition and machine calculation are two equally valid instruments for exploring reality. A time-stream of data from any compliant source—whether a live observation of a human system or a high-frequency numerical simulation—can be ingested and understood by the same analytical tools. This protocol is the unbroken thread that connects the raw chaos of reality to the clarifying lens of the framework, preserving provenance and causality at every step.
