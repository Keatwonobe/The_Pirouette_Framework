The properties of a boundary are emergent features, direct reflections of the coherence of the system it contains. The shell does not *create* stability; it is the *proof* of it.

*   **Integrity (Projection of `T_a`):** The stability of a boundary is an external projection of the internal system's **Time Adherence** (CORE-005). A system with a pure, stable, and highly coherent Ki pattern (high `T_a`) will manifest a strong, resilient, and well-defined boundary. A system with a decaying internal state (low `T_a`) will have a weak, fluctuating, and "leaky" boundary.

*   **Permeability (Resonant Coupling):** A boundary is not a passive filter but an active resonator. Its permeability is a function of its geometry of resonance, governed by the principles of the **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). An external influence can cross the boundary only if its own Ki pattern can perform a "Resonant Handshake" with the boundary's Ki. This is selective permeability in its most fundamental form: the membrane listens to every knock, but the door only opens for those who know the password, which is a harmonic of its own song.

*   **Interface (Phase Geometry):** This describes the boundary's outermost resonant layerâ€”how it "presents" itself to the world. The phase and harmonic structure of this interface determines its capacity for interaction. It can be a repulsive barrier that prevents union or a welcoming "handshake" that facilitates it.
