summary: "Outlines the formal program for quantizing the classical field theory of the Pirouette Framework. This module specifies the procedure for promoting the classical Coherence (C) and Temporal Pressure (Γ) fields to quantum operators, and derives the fundamental tools of interaction—the Coherence Propagator and Interaction Vertex—providing the complete machinery for calculating high-precision quantum predictions like the g-2 anomaly."
