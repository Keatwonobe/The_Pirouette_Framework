The theoretical framework for PDM-001 is complete and the debate phase is formally closed. The consensus-driven Sentinel Protocol is now ready for practical validation. The immediate next step is the initiation of **PDM-002: The Sentinel Protocol Simulation Workshop**.

The first objective will be to model **Test Case 001: "The Leaky Dam"** to stress-test the protocol's ability to detect and prevent cumulative harm via the Cumulative Residual Logging and Dynamic Gating mechanisms. This marks the transition from abstract formulation to concrete implementation.
