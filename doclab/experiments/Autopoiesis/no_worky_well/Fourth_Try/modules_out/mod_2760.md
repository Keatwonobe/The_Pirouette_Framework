Power Cost: The base EP cost for a magical effect is determined by its intended damage or power, as per the Direct Influence rules (TLE-000).

Range Cost: Projecting one's will across a distance relies on the power used. 1 EP spent on damage grants 5 feet of range to the spell. 1 additional EP can be spent on 5-10 feet of distance to the cast via the Spell Sniper's Gambit below.

General Rule: Split Cast

Any spellcaster can target an additional creature with a single-target spell by spending an additional 3 EP from the spell's pool.

- §1 · The Concordant Act: Acting as One
While individual initiative dictates the flow of battle, true power lies in unity. A group of beings can choose to synchronize their actions, weaving their individual efforts into a single, decisive moment.

Declaring Intent: On your turn, if you wish to act in concert with an ally, you must declare your intent and the general nature of your action (e.g., "I'm going to hold my fire spell to combine with Gronk's attack."). You must have at least one action, bonus action, or reaction remaining to do this.

The Lowest Ebb: When two or more individuals agree to act together, they forsake their own place in the turn order. All participants in the Concordant Act will take their actions on the lowest initiative count among the group.

Combined Effect: The effects of all combined actions resolve simultaneously at the designated target or location. The total EP invested from all participants is summed to determine the final effect, following all normal entropy rules.

- §2 · Elemental Synergy & Interaction
Entropy is not static; it is a reactive and volatile force. When different elemental expressions are brought together, they can combine to create new, powerful tertiary effects. This is not a rigid system of rock-paper-scissors, but a fluid principle based on narrative and physical logic.

The Principle of Synergy: When two or more elemental effects (e.g., a Fire spell and a Water spell) target the same creature or occupy the same 5-foot space in the same round, they interact. The resulting effect is determined by the GM based on the nature of the elements involved. Players are encouraged to be creative.

Example 1: A "Lava" spell (Fire + Earth) and a "Frost" spell target the same space. The intense thermal shock could cause the lava to instantly harden into obsidian, creating a permanent physical barrier or potentially trapping a creature.

Example 2: A "Fireball" and a "Geyser" (Water) spell detonate on the same target. The result is a massive, blinding cloud of steam, heavily obscuring the area.

The Smothered Condition: When a creature is fully encased in a solid substance created by an elemental interaction (such as the obsidian from Example 1), they gain the Smothered condition. A Smothered creature cannot move or take actions and begins to suffocate. At the start of each of its turns, it takes irreducible damage equal to 1/8th of its maximum HP. It can use its action to attempt to break free by making a Strength check against a TN set by the GM based on the material's durability.

- §3 · Arcane Dueling: Spell Interception
In a world governed by Entropy, a spell is not an unstoppable force but a tangible projection of will. A skilled caster can learn to unravel an opponent's spell before it ever takes effect, turning arcane combat into a deadly, tactical duel.

The Interception: You can use your reaction to attempt to counter a spell that is being cast by a creature you can see. You must declare that you are targeting their spell, not the caster.

The Contested Will: Intercepting a spell is a contested check. You make an attack roll (d20 + your spellcasting attribute modifier, typically INT or WIS). The Target Number (TN) for this roll is 10 + the total EP the enemy caster invested in their spell.

The Outcome:

Success: Your will overpowers theirs. Your spell collides with their nascent magic, causing both to collapse in a burst of harmless, chaotic energy. Both spells are nullified, and the EP for both is spent.

Failure: Your spell is too weak or too slow. It fails to disrupt the enemy's casting, and their spell takes effect as normal. Your EP is still spent.
