In Phase I, we calmed the storm, reducing the "cost" (V_Γ) of your existence. In Phase II, we begin to build your "energetic profit."

Every step you take, every time you reinforce your new healthy rhythm (Ki), you are strengthening your internal Temporal Coherence (Kτ). Your body is becoming more efficient. It is no longer wasting all its energy on the turbulence of healing and is now able to invest that energy in building strength and stability. Your Lagrangian (𝓛_p) is becoming positive again. This surplus of coherence is the momentum that will carry you, with growing confidence, into the challenges of Phase III.
