**Yes.** According to the framework, survival in a chaotic system is not solely dependent on power ($\Gamma$). A high-$\Gamma$ entity in a low-$T_a$ state (like a collapsing, incoherent empire) is brittle and prone to shattering.

The Weavers would represent a different kind of entity:
* **Extremely Low Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$):** They have no army, no territory, no conventional power. They are geopolitically irrelevant. This is not a weakness; it is their shield. The collapsing empires are fighting each other for the scraps of the old world's power, and they would not see the Weavers as a threat worth noticing.
* **Extremely High Time-Adherence ($T_a$):** Their defining characteristic is their coherence. They have a stable, long-term vision, a unified understanding of the world, and a social structure that is resilient to the decoherence attacks plaguing everyone else.
* **An Orthogonal Phase ($\phi$):** Their goal is not `GOAL_STATUS_QUO` or `GOAL_HEGEMONY`. It is `GOAL_ESCAPE_VELOCITY`. They are not trying to win the game; they are trying to leave the board.

In this configuration, the Weavers could survive. They would be a small, coherent vessel navigating a hurricane by being too small and too focused to be capsized by the great waves crashing against the battleships.
