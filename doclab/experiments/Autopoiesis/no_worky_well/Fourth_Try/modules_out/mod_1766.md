The engine operates in a continuous three-stage cycle, transforming the raw noise of reality into the clear signal of an impending shift.

| Step | Function | Pirouette Framework Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **I. Gradient Detection** | Calculate the **Coherence Gradient (∇Kτ)** for each stream. | This replaces the "Entropy Shock Index." A system's information content is its coherence (CORE-013). The Engine measures the first derivative of this coherence, flagging moments of rapid ordering (a sharp positive gradient) as significant signals. It is listening for the "in-breath" of new information entering a system. |
| **II. Resonance Scoring** | Measure the degree of **Manifold Resonance** across all streams. | This replaces the "Cross-domain burst score." When multiple streams exhibit correlated coherence gradients, the engine calculates their **Resonant Coupling Score**. This metric assesses not just correlation, but the degree of phase-lock and harmonic compatibility between the systems' Ki patterns. |
| **III. Event Forecasting** | Issue a **Synthesis Brief** when the coupling score exceeds a threshold. | This replaces the "Augury Card." The brief provides a data-grounded diagnostic of the impending shift, including a forecast of its likely nature based on the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001). |

The engine ingests multiple, heterogeneous data streams, viewing each as a probe into a specific coherence manifold.
