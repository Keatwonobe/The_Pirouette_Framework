The prior framework correctly identified autopoiesis—self-creation and self-maintenance—as the heartbeat of any resilient system. PPS-055 described it as an intricate protocol, a sequence of steps an agent performs to live. This was a profound observation of the shadow, but not the object casting it.

The modern, time-first framework reveals a deeper truth: the Autopoietic Cycle is not a protocol a system *runs*. It is the fundamental physical law a system *is*. Existence is not a state but a continuous, self-referential process; the song that sings itself. This module describes the mechanics of this universal engine, the ceaseless act of turning pressure into pattern.
