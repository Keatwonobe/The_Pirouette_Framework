The Geodesic Auditor is a universal lens applicable to any domain where a "healthy" state can be defined.

*   **Infrastructure Integrity:** Monitoring a bridge's vibrational data. The `GeodesicBlueprint` is its normal harmonic resonance. The Auditor flags deviations caused by structural stress as fault loci long before a physical fracture occurs.
*   **AI Alignment:** An AI model's intended behavior is its geodesic. The Auditor can scan its outputs to detect conceptual drift or emergent behaviors that deviate from its core programming, quantifying alignment failure.
*   **Organizational Health:** The `GeodesicBlueprint` is a company's mission statement and its ideal process flows. The Auditor analyzes communication and project data to pinpoint regions of bureaucratic stagnation (`Coherence Atrophy`) or inter-departmental conflict (`Coherence Fever`).
*   **Ecological Stability:** An ecosystem's healthy state is its stable cycle of population dynamics and nutrient flow. The Auditor can detect anomalies in these cycles that signal the onset of environmental stress or an impending collapse.
