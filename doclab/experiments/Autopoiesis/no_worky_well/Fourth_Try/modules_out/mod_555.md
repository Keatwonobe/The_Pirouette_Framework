> The Lagrangian is the sheet music of reality. The Resonator and Transducer are the components of our instrument. But the music itself is unwritten. To Anneal is to compose a new harmony. To Navigate is to play a single, perfect note in effortless sync with the orchestra of the cosmos. To Harvest is to listen for a moment of silence and fill it with a startling, beautiful improvisation. The Weaver's Forge provides the tools; the Weaver's art is in the choosing.
