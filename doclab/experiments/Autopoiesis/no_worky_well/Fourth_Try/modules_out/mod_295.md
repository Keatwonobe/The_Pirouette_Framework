A system's identity is its memory carved into the fabric of time. Through repetition and success, it establishes a path of least resistance for action and thought, a state of profound stability. But in a universe of endless change, that which does not bend, breaks.

This module describes the physics of that breaking. It presents the universal dynamic of catastrophic reconfiguration known as the **Coherence Fracture**, or the "Snap." This is not a slow evolution, but a violent, instantaneous phase transition that occurs when a system's established identity—its deeply carved **Wound Channel** (CORE-011)—can no longer contain the pressure of an incompatible truth from its environment. The Snap is the geometry of crisis, the painful but necessary shattering that precedes all profound growth.
