The character of a rupture reveals the underlying health of the system that failed. By applying the principles of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`), we can classify all ruptures into three archetypal modes:

1.  **Brittle Rupture (The Sudden Shattering):**
    This occurs in systems that appear stable and highly ordered (`Laminar Flow`) but possess a rigid, unadaptive `Kτ` pattern. When faced with a sudden, sharp increase in `Γ`, the system cannot deform or adapt. It maintains its coherence perfectly until the moment it fails completely and catastrophically.
    *   *Manifestations:* A glass shattering, a sudden stock market crash, a seemingly stable relationship ending without warning.

2.  **Ductile Rupture (The Slow Tearing):**
    This is the failure mode of a system already in a state of `Turbulent Flow`. It is characterized by chaos and visible strain. The rupture is not a sudden event but the culmination of a prolonged struggle where the system deforms, stretches, and visibly weakens before it finally tears apart.
    *   *Manifestations:* A metal component failing after showing visible stress, a company slowly collapsing amidst infighting, a political movement tearing itself apart through factionalism.

3.  **Fatigue Rupture (Resonant Fatigue):**
    This pathology results from the slow degradation of a system’s `Wound Channel` (`CORE-011`). The system is subjected to repeated cycles of sub-critical stress. Each cycle is weathered but deepens the wound, eroding the system's baseline coherence. Eventually, a stressor that would have once been trivial provides the final impetus for a complete collapse.
    *   *Manifestations:* A bridge collapsing due to metal fatigue, burnout in an individual after years of chronic stress, the fall of an empire weakened by a thousand small crises.
