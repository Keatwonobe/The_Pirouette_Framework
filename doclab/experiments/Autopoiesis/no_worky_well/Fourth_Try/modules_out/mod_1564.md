summary: "Refactors persuasion into a time-first dynamics model called 'coherence\
  \ sculpting.' It replaces the outdated model of 'force vs. resistance' with a protocol\
  \ for guiding a participant's belief system towards a new geodesic\u2014a path of\
  \ maximal coherence. The Weaver achieves this not by coercion, but by introducing\
  \ a new, resonant potential that alters the participant's own coherence landscape,\
  \ making the new belief feel like a natural and insightful evolution."
