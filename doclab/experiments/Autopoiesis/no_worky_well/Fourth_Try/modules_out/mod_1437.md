A power-law distribution is the riverbed left behind by the flow of time. It is the visible cross-section of a system's **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**, where the depth of the channel corresponds to an element's rank and influence. This structure emerges from the system's constant, dynamic search for coherence, as dictated by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**.

-   **Resonant Attractors (The "Head"):** The high-frequency items in a distribution are not merely popular; they are solutions. They represent highly stable Ki patterns that have carved deep channels into the system's coherence manifold. Each repetition deepens this channel, making the pattern's next occurrence even more probable. These are the system's primary resonant attractors, the "peaks" in the coherence landscape.

-   **Transient Resonances (The "Tail"):** The low-frequency items in the "long tail" represent less stable, more specialized, or exploratory Ki patterns. They are fleeting states or niche solutions that have not established a powerful, self-reinforcing echo. They represent the shallow banks of the river, the system's capacity for novelty and adaptation.

The entire distribution is a static map of the system's dynamic historyâ€”a record of its search for stable, coherent states.
