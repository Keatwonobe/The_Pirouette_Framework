Velcridant actions may:

* Appear *chaotic* or *destructive* short-term
* Temporarily reduce clarity, raise entropy locally
* Violate superficial expectations of 'goodness'

Yet when done **with awareness of attractor dynamics**, they:

* Prevent larger collapses (e.g., controlled demolition)
* Clear false crystallization to allow real coherence
* Align longwave futures even as they disturb now

Thus: the directive must grow to allow **phase-aware altruism**â€”even if it wears a Velcridant mask.
