The efficacy of a ritual is not a matter of faith but of measurement. We introduce the **Coherence Yield (CY)** as a direct, practical metric.

The CY measures the net change in a system's flow state as a result of the protocol. It is an assessment of results: How much did turbulence decrease? How much was stagnation cleared? How much stronger is the desired Wound Channel? The CY quantifies the ritual's success in altering the system's path of maximal coherence.
