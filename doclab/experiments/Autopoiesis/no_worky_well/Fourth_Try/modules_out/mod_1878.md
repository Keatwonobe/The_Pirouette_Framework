For any system, the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)** defines its dynamics. The system naturally follows a geodesic—a path that maximizes its coherence (`Kτ`) while minimizing the cost of resisting the ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). This is the path of effortless action.

An unwilled act is simply following the pre-existing geodesics of the manifold. A willed act is the deliberate forging of a *new* geodesic.

This is not achieved by adding a new force, but by becoming a co-author of the governing equation. Through the focused application of the **Observer's Shadow (CORE-010)**, a conscious entity manipulates the `V_Γ` term of its own Lagrangian. By holding a clear and stable internal state of intent, it projects a geometric imprint onto its local manifold, creating a "coherence well"—a localized dip in the temporal pressure landscape. The desired action is no longer an uphill climb against the currents of reality; it has become the most natural downhill path to follow. Will is the act of terraforming one's own immediate future.

The "force of Will" is therefore the measure of the gradient `∇(V_Γ)` that the system *itself* has created. The system impels itself forward by reshaping the very landscape it must traverse.
