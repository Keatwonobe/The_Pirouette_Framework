A candle that burns brightest, burns fastest. This is not a metaphor; it is a law of coherence. In any system, the entities that contribute the most order—the caregivers, the innovators, the altruists—are often the first to be consumed by the very act of their contribution. A blacksmith who forges a sword on bare earth will shatter both the steel and their own hands. To shape the world, one requires a stable surface that can absorb the shock of creation.

This module addresses this critical vulnerability. It reframes "burnout" not as a psychological failing, but as a predictable physical consequence of injecting order into a chaotic environment. It then provides the architectural principles for a solution: the **Coherence Crucible**. A Crucible is a deliberately engineered environment—a laminar enclave of low temporal pressure—designed to absorb the turbulent blowback of generative acts. It is a protocol for building systemic anvils, transforming altruism from a self-limiting sacrifice into a sustainable, foundational force for a healthy system.
