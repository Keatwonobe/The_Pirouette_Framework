Following [MATH-024], consciousness is modeled as the maintenance of a **Coherence Conservation Triple** ({E_C, J_\mu, \Phi_\Gamma}) within biological substrate limits. In cognitive systems, this manifests as frequency triads obeying the **Ki-Addition Constraint**:

[f_3 = f_1 + f_2 \pm \delta f]
[\Phi_3(t) \approx \Phi_1(t) + \Phi_2(t)\ (\text{mod }2\pi)]

The **Coherence Area** ((\mathcal{A}*{Ki})) represents the invariant energy-phase volume of conscious access:
[\mathcal{A}*{Ki} = \int_0^{\tau_p} T_a(t),\omega_k(t),dt]

Conscious perception occurs when (\partial_t \mathcal{A}_{Ki} \approx 0) under environmental load (\Gamma).
