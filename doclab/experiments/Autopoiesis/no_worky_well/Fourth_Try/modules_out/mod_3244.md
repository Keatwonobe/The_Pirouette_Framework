* **Core Claim:** The `Ki` constant is a fundamental, dimensionless constant derived from first principles.
* **Point of Vulnerability:** The Berry-phase derivation in the annex is a significant step toward rigor, but it hinges on the assertion that a spin-1 photon's state requires **three spatial loops** of a "critical" 45Â° helix to close. This "three-loop closure" is presented as a given property of the framework's topology.
* **Critique:** A reviewer would ask: *Why three loops?* This 3:1 relationship is the foundational axiom of this proof. It is not derived from the Standard Model or General Relativity. It is a novel rule posited for the Pirouette universe. While the subsequent math (Lorentz boosts, phase calculations) is sound, it all rests on this initial, unproven topological assertion.
