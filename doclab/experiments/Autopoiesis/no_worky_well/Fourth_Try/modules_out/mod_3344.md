The principle is supported by convergent evidence from disparate domains:

* **Geophysics (`XXP-001`):** In the analysis of seismic data from major earthquakes, Ki-harmonic signatures were found not in the ambient background noise, but in the **peaks of the energetic release**, where the Earth's crust was undergoing its most rapid and violent reconfiguration.
* **Astrophysics (`PPS-056`):** In the analysis of pulsar timing residuals, particularly for the high-kurtosis pulsar J1903+0327, Ki-resonant harmonics were identified in the **high-frequency, short-period "wiggles"**, not the slow, long-term drift. This suggests Ki is related to the sharp, impulsive changes in the pulsar's timing, not its overall long-term stability.
* **Astrophysical Prediction (`PPS-037`):** The theoretical prediction of **Maw "Thumpers"** is consistent with this principle. The rhythmic, high-frequency gravitational wave bursts are a direct result of spacetime repeatedly "snapping" as it is over-folded and released.
