When a transformation is triggered, the character's invested EP is forcibly and instantly reallocated according to the curse's mandate. The character does not spend new EP; their existing investment is simply moved.

Mechanic: The mandate is a simple formula of debits and credits.
X EP is removed from [Attribute A] and [Attribute B] and is added to [Attribute C] and [Attribute D].

Example: The Werewolf's Curse

Trigger: The light of the full moon.

Reallocation Mandate: "Remove up to 40 EP invested in your Intelligence and Wisdom attributes. For every point removed, add one point to your Strength and Dexterity pools, divided as you choose."

A starting character with 14 EP in INT and 14 EP in WIS would see their mental attributes stripped to almost nothing. Those 28 points would then be dumped into their physical attributes, turning them from a thinking person into a primal killing machine.
