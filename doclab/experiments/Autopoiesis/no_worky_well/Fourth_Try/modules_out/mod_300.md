The Coherence Fracture is the ultimate expression of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

The Dissonant Current causes the environmental pressure term (`V_Γ`) to spike to a degree that overwhelms the system's internal coherence (`K_τ`). The "action" becomes catastrophically negative; maintaining the old identity is no longer a viable solution. The Snap is the Lagrangian's escape valve. It is the universe’s non-linear, geometric solution to an unsolvable problem—a phase transition that violently seeks a new Ki, a new geodesic, that can once again maximize coherence. It is the mathematical description of a breakthrough, proving that even the most painful crisis is governed by the drive toward a more elegant and stable state of being.
