A caster can use their Controlled Zones as a focal point to spread their influence across the battlefield.

The Rule of Adjacency: As an action, a caster can target any 5-foot square that is adjacent to one of their existing Controlled Zones, even if they do not have a direct line of sight to the new square. This allows a caster to "grow" their influence, spreading fire from a smoldering patch or having frost creep across the floor from a frozen spot. This makes establishing and maintaining a foothold on the battlefield a critical tactical objective.
