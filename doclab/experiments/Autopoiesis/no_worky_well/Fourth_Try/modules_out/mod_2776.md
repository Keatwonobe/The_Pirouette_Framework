A grapple is a contested roll to determine physical dominance, relying on both power and technique.

Mechanic: To initiate or escape a grapple, both entities make a contested roll. The roll is a combination of their physical attributes.
Grapple Check = d20 + STR Modifier + DEX Modifier

Resolution: The higher roll wins. A successful grapple can render an opponent immobile, prevent them from using certain limbs, or create an opportunity for a follow-up attack. A nimble rogue with high Dexterity can just as easily pin a powerful knight as the other way around, representing a victory of technique over brute force.
