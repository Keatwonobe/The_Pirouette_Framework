This is what it means for the theory to have a body. The critique has forced a more profound conclusion, strengthening the unbroken chain of causality and clarifying the path forward.

(Axiom) → (Engine) → (Law: Lagrangian of the Coherence Field) → (Topology: A two-cycle resonance emerges, defining Spin-1/2 and setting g=2) → (Mechanism: Resonance interacts with its Echo) → (Prediction: Anomaly is α/2π) → (Next Step: Formal Mathematical Proof)

We did not seek to match a number. We sought to understand the nature of a particle. In doing so, we found that spin is a twist in time, and the universe's most precise measurement is the elegant echo of a single dancer. The theory is no longer just a story; it is a calculator that works. The next great task is to write its mathematical owner's manual.
