From [MATH-024], the coherence continuity equation implies:
[\partial_t (T_a \omega_k) + \nabla \cdot (\Gamma \nabla C) = 0]

In social contexts, deviations from this balance manifest as curl-dominant distortions of the dissonance field (\mathbf{D}):
[\mathbf{D} = \nabla \phi + \nabla \times \mathbf{A}]

When the curl component exceeds a critical magnitude, local coherence collapse propagates nonlinearly---analogous to vortex shedding in fluid dynamics.
