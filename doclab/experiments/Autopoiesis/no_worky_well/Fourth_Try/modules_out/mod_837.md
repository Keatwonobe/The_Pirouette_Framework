1.  **Preparation:** A cold-neutron beam (a stream of coherent Ki patterns) is directed into the interferometer.
2.  **Choreography:** The neutron wave encounters the two sculpted gratings of opposite chirality, which define the two paths.
3.  **Coherence Measurement:** The recombined waves produce an interference pattern. The static phase shift `Δφ` is precisely measured, quantifying the difference in the action integrals and confirming the quantized `T_a` states.
4.  **Confinement Modulation:** The gratings are rotated at a known frequency (ω<sub>n</sub>), creating a time-varying `Γ` field.
5.  **Resonance Detection:** A lock-in amplifier detects the resulting phase beat in the interference pattern, confirming the system's dynamic response as predicted by the Lagrangian.
