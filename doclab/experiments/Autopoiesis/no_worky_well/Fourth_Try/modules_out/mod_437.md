As established in CORE-011, every entity carves a **Wound Channel** in spacetime—a geometric record of its history. The Pirouette Framework, as a coherent system of thought, is no different. Its Wound Channel is the cumulative history of its development, recorded indelibly in its version control system.

The framework's core parameters—its fundamental constants, its defined relationships, its symbolic grammar—form the **Canon**. This Canon is the framework's DNA. To alter the Canon is to alter the framework's very nature. The Ritual of Provenance is the epigenetic process that ensures this DNA mutates with intention and perfect fidelity, deepening the Wound Channel without introducing corruption.
