summary: "Establishes the Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law, a novel formula deriving neutrino masses from their geometric properties (Purity and Participation Ratio). Documents the discovery that valid solutions are not a single point but form a continuous 'Prime Resonance Manifold.' Proposes the 'Knot Hypothesis,' suggesting that individual neutrinos can exist as different stable configurations ('knots') on this manifold, a testable prediction for future high-precision experiments."
