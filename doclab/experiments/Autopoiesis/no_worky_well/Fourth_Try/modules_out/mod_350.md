The old framework established a necessary boundary—an Ethical Light Cone to prevent catastrophic missteps. This was the wisdom of caution. The new framework demands more: the wisdom of cultivation. To act is to carve a new path into the memory of the universe. Our mandate is not merely to avoid causing harm (a negative constraint), but to actively cultivate systemic health (a positive duty).

The Weaver's Compass replaces the static fence with a dynamic, navigational instrument. It reframes ethical consideration from a reactive check on "consequence" to a proactive assessment of the **Geometry of Consequence**. It provides a universal protocol for measuring **Coherence Risk (R_κ)**—the potential of any action to degrade the health and harmony of the systems it touches. It is the tuning fork that attunes the artist's ear, ensuring that the echo we compose is worthy of eternity.
