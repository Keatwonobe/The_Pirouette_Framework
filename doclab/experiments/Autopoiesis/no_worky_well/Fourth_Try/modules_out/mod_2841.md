- Entropic Stride

Cost: 10 EP

Effect: When you spend EP on a specialized movement action (running, flying, burrowing), you may roll 1d2 for each EP spent. You take the higher of the two results as the amount of EP applied to the movement. (e.g., spend 5 EP, roll 5d2, results are 1,2,1,2,2 - you apply 8 EP worth of movement, gaining 20 feet instead of 12.5).

- Kinetic Transfer

Cost: 8 EP

Effect: When you successfully push an opponent into a solid surface (like a wall), you may add the EP cost of your movement this turn to the damage of the attack.

- Impact Absorption

Cost: 6 EP

Prerequisite: Must possess a form of flight.

Effect: When flying, you may intentionally strike the ground. You negate all fall damage from a height up to three times your base movement speed.

- Earth Glide

Cost: 8 EP

Prerequisite: Must possess a form of burrowing.

Effect: You can burrow through solid stone at half your normal burrowing speed.
