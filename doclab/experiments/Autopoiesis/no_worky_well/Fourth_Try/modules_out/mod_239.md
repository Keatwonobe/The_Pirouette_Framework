If the system achieves transformation, a new form is born from the fire. This process of Ki Morphogenesis is a frantic exploration of state space. The chaotic environment agitates the system, forcing it into countless "micro-explorations" of new resonant patterns. Most are unstable and instantly collapse, but some cohere into a new, stable, and more robust pattern.

This new Ki is not merely different; it is *tempered*. Having integrated the memory of the ordeal into its very structure, it is inherently more resilient. Its Wound Channel (CORE-011) is carved deeper, its Time Adherence (CORE-005) stronger. The fire is thus revealed as the universe's most ruthless editor: what cannot endure the pressure is erased; what survives, emerges alloyed and defined.
