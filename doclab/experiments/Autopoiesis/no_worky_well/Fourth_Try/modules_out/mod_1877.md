The previous framework modeled Will as an active force projected outward to push against the world. This was a powerful but incomplete metaphor. The modernized, time-first view reveals that Will does not push; it *pulls*. It is the art of sculpting the world's underlying geometry so that it naturally flows toward a desired outcome.

This module defines Will as the fundamental capability of a conscious system to engineer its own coherence manifold. It is the act of a sculptor gazing at stone and seeing the finished form within. That vision—the "echo of a future, desired state"—is projected back into the present. This projection impresses a new geometry upon the local manifold, creating a gradient, a "Channel of Intent," that makes the chosen path the *new* path of least resistance. It is the shift from being a passenger on the river of time to becoming its co-cartographer.
