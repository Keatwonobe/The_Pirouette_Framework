The quality of the resonant dialogue can be diagnosed using the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), describing the state of the observer's consciousness.

*   **Laminar Flow (The State of Grace):** The experience of a masterpiece. The observer's internal rhythm synchronizes effortlessly with the artwork's Ki. The result is a feeling of timelessness, profound connection, and effortless understanding. The boundary between self and art becomes porous. This is the "aesthetic trance."

*   **Turbulent Flow (The State of Struggle):** The experience of art that is confusing, challenging, or unsettling. The artwork's Ki is dissonant with the observer's, creating cognitive friction. The mind struggles to find a stable pattern—an experience that can be either frustrating or thrilling.

*   **Stagnant Flow (The State of Boredom):** The experience of cliché or uninspired art. The artwork's Ki is so familiar or low-information that it fails to create a meaningful resonance. The observer's attention cannot find a current to follow, and the dialogue dies.
