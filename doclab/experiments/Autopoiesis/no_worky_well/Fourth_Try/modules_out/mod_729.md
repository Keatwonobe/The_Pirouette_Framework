The resolution of a Fork is an irreversible act of creation with clear and immediate consequences:

*   **Clean Divergence:** The new paths are coherent and distinct. The system that chose path A and the system that chose path B now inhabit different, stable realities.
*   **Irreversibility:** The formation of a new Wound Channel creates a "coherence debt" that must be paid to return to the choice point. The river has carved its new bed; flowing uphill is now energetically costly.
*   **Information Genesis:** In selecting one path from many, the system resolves uncertainty and creates new information, increasing the complexity and richness of the cosmos (as defined in CORE-013). Every choice is an act of writing the universe.
