1.  **Archive `PPS-035`:** The current version of `PPS-035` will be marked as superseded. Its core insights about Γ as a dynamic field will be preserved, but the section deriving G will be formally deprecated.
2.  **Amend `PPS-001` & `PPS-007`:** The core Lagrangian and Parameter Registry will be updated to clarify that G is the *macroscopic effective value* of Γ, not a separately derived constant.
