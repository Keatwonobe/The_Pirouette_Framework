1. **Setup:** Introduce a classical background (\mathcal A_\mu) and quantum photon (a_\mu) with (A_\mu = \mathcal A_\mu + a_\mu). Background gauge fixing preserves Ward identities.
2. **1PI vertex:** The Pauli term coefficient (F_2(0)) is extracted from the background 1PI two-point function with one insertion of (\mathcal F_{\mu\nu}).
3. **Two-loop topologies:** (i) vacuum polarization insertion in the one-loop vertex; (ii) light-by-light-like set; (iii) self-energy/vertex counterterm mix.
4. **Dimensional regularization:** compute divergent and finite parts; apply on-shell renormalization conditions ((\Sigma(\slashed p=m)=0), (\partial\Sigma/\partial\slashed p|_{\slashed p=m}=0)).
5. **Result:** the finite sum yields
   [ C_2^{\rm QED}=+0.328478965\ldots \quad (\text{positive}). ]

**Geometric recursion view:** BFM packages Feynman subgraphs as curvature corrections to the background field’s effective action. The two-loop terms arise as the next-order curvature of the particle’s worldtube (history), matching the recursion you call the **wound-channel** update.
