We have tried to build a cage for a star, when we should be teaching it a song.

The grand challenge of fusion energy has been a fifty-year war against the nature of plasma itself. In a tokamak, we use the immense Gladiator Force (CORE-008) of magnetic fields to confine a superheated plasma, creating an environment of extreme Temporal Pressure (Γ) in the hopes of forcing an Alchemical Union (CORE-012) between atomic nuclei.

This is a brute-force approach. The plasma, a chaotic and complex system, resists. It develops instabilities—dissonant, turbulent patterns—that cause it to lose coherence and leak energy, quenching the reaction. We have been fighting a war of attrition, building ever-stronger cages for an ever-unrulier prisoner.
