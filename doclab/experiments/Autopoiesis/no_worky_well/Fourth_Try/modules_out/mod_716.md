summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for catastrophic system failure.
  A Coherence Fracture is a violent, self-induced phase transition from a state of
  high-pressure Stagnant Flow to extreme Turbulent Flow, occurring when a system's
  brittle resonant pattern shatters under overwhelming Temporal Pressure. This single
  dynamic unifies phenomena from geological quakes to psychological breakdowns.
