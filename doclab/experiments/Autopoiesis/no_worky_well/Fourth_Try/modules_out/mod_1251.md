To apply this model, we use the protocol of The Fractal Bridge (CORE-014) to translate abstract principles into concrete variables.

| Universal Principle     | Domain Manifestation in Criminal Justice                                                                                             |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coherence (Kτ)**      | An individual’s stability: stable housing, employment, pro-social relationships, mental health. A system's success in fostering these outcomes. |
| **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** | The ambient stress and chaos: conditions of confinement, uncertainty of trial, stigma of a criminal record, pressure to re-offend for survival. |
| **Wound Channel**       | The inertia of the past: an individual's criminal record, the psychological trauma of incarceration, deeply carved neural pathways of old habits. |
| **Alchemical Union**    | A successful act of restorative justice; an individual forging a new, pro-social identity that supersedes their past; forging a bipartisan reform bill. |

The diagnostic process is threefold:
1.  **Map the Currents:** Identify the critical flows of coherence in the journey from arrest to reintegration.
2.  **Diagnose the Pathology:** Identify regions of Atrophy, Fever, or Erosion using the framework in §4.
3.  **Propose Intervention (The Daedalus Gambit):** Design interventions that sculpt the manifold. To cure Atrophy, remove the dam (e.g., clear court backlogs). To cure Fever, introduce a harmonizing signal (e.g., evidence-based therapy) to calm the turbulence.
