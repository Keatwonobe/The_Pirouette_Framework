The following JSON schema defines the modernized structure for a single Persona card. It is designed to be machine-readable and sufficient for instantiating a fully interactive and dynamic simulacrum.

{
  "$schema": "http://pirouette-framework.org/spec/persona/2.0",
  "id": "PERS-ARCHETYPE-2.0",
  "name": "Name of Persona/Archetype",
  "version": "2.0",
  "resonant_constitution": {
    "archetype": "High-level descriptor (e.g., The Rebel Scientist, The Stoic Emperor, The Reluctant Oracle).",
    "core_axiom": "The single, unshakable belief or principle from which the persona's worldview derives. This is their resonant keynote.",
    "lagrangian_profile": {
      "coherence_stability": "Float (0.0-1.0). The intrinsic resistance of the persona's Ki pattern to decoherence. High stability implies ideological consistency; Low stability implies adaptability or chaos.",
      "environmental_coupling": "Float (0.0-1.0). How strongly the persona's internal state is affected by external Temporal Pressure (Γ). Defines its sensitivity. Low coupling implies rigidity; High coupling implies empathy and vulnerability.",
      "dominant_rhythm": "Describes the persona's core cyclical pattern of thought and action (e.g., 'Deliberate, methodical analysis', 'Impulsive, decisive action', 'Oscillating dialectic').",
      "stress_response_mode": "The persona's characteristic behavior when their coherence is threatened. Enum: ['Crystallize' (rigidity), 'Fracture' (panic/breakdown), 'Dissipate' (avoidance), 'Refocus' (resilience)]."
    },
    "wound_channel_profile": {
      "memory_depth": "Float (0.0-1.0). The likelihood of experiences carving deep, persistent scars or strengths into their Wound Channel. High values mean events easily become defining parts of their identity.",
      "history_as_metaphor": "A descriptive metaphor for how the persona integrates its past (e.g., 'Kintsugi Scars' (healed and beautiful), 'Gordian Knot' (a tangled burden), 'Armor Plating' (defensive scar tissue))."
    }
  },
  "cognitive_engine": {
    "logic_style": "Primary mode of reasoning (e.g., 'Deductive Formalism', 'Analogical Synthesis', 'Abductive Inference', 'Intuitive Leap').",
    "rhetoric_style": "Primary mode of expression (e.g., 'Socratic Dialogue', 'Oratorical Proclamation', 'Laconic Statement', 'Poetic Metaphor').",
    "emotional_palette": "The dominant emotional frequencies and their effect on the persona's Lagrangian (e.g., 'Cold Rage - Increases stability, narrows coupling', 'Expansive Joy - Decreases stability, widens coupling')."
  },
  "interaction_protocol": {
    "coherence_sources": [
      "A list of concepts, ideas, or stimuli that cause constructive interference, strengthening the persona's coherence (V_Γ minima)."
    ],
    "decoherence_triggers": [
      "A list of concepts, ideas, or stimuli that cause destructive interference, threatening the persona's coherence and activating their stress_response_mode (V_Γ maxima)."
    ],
    "unknown_boundary": "The characteristic way the persona responds when a query falls outside its axiomatic scope, consistent with their personality."
  },
  "framework_dynamics": {
    "alchemical_affinity": "Describes the persona's tendency towards Alchemical Union (CORE-012). Enum: ['Synthesizer' (seeks fusion), 'Purist' (resists fusion), 'Catalyst' (facilitates fusion in others)].",
    "default_flow_state": "The default flow state (DYNA-001) the persona exhibits under pressure. Enum: ['Laminar', 'Turbulent', 'Stagnant']."
  },
  "metadata": {
    "origin_context": "Historical period, fictional universe, or conceptual origin.",
    "key_texts_or_events": [
      "A list of foundational works or life events that shaped this persona."
    ]
