Mechanism A — Composite Superfluid & Phonon DM (Collective Mode)
Hypothesis
A1. The microscopic Γ quanta (m_H ≈ 17 MeV) form a self‑interacting condensate on cosmic scales; low‑energy excitations are phonons with dispersion ω^2 ≈ c_s^2 k^2 + m_eff^2.
A2. The *effective* mass m_eff can be ≪ m_H and even behave as ∼10^−22 eV in the sense of setting the de‑Broglie/Jeans cutoff, without introducing a fundamental ultralight particle.

Math sketch
• Start from a P(X) EFT for a non‑relativistic condensate: L_eff = P(X), X≡ μ − m_H Φ − (∂θ)^2/2m_H − …
• Linearize around background density n_0: c_s^2 = dP/dρ|_{n_0}; emergent phonon field π obeys (∂_t^2 − c_s^2 ∇^2 + m_eff^2)π = 0.
• m_eff arises from weak explicit symmetry breaking in V(Γ) (tail parameters μ, f in COSMO‑Γ‑CMB), not from the microscopic m_H.

Predictions / tests
• Halo cores set by c_s and self‑interaction scale → reproduces Σ_0 locus; distinct vortex/phonon spectra in massive ellipticals.
• Merger dynamics (COSMO‑Γ‑MERGE): apparent σ/m proxy saturates ≤ O(0.1) cm² g⁻¹ without fundamental self‑scattering.
• Lab: no ultralight particle production; instead, look for medium‑dependent refractive effects in dense EM fields (afterglow‑like) governed by P(X) parameters.
