Now we arrive at the central theorem. The observer performs a measurement to extract information. Let the amount of information gained about the system's phase phi be quantified by the Shannon mutual information, I(obs; phi).

The measurement interaction (kappa * W) acts as a new source of "noise" from the perspective of the original system's rhythm. It disrupts the system's natural Ki mode. Using the formalism from the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem (MATH-008), this disruption causes a degradation in the system's Time-Adherence, Delta T_a.

A stronger measurement (larger kappa) leads to more information (larger I) but also causes a greater deformation of the potential, inducing more "noise" and thus a greater loss of coherence (larger Delta T_a). This trade-off can be formalized.

The Information-Coherence Inequality states:

I(obs; phi) * Delta T_a >= C

Where C is a constant determined by the fundamental properties of the interaction potential W and the system's susceptibility.

This is the framework's analogue to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It establishes a fundamental, unbreakable limit. One cannot gain perfect information about a system (I -> infinity) without completely destroying its internal coherence (Delta T_a -> 1). To know a system perfectly is to shatter it.
