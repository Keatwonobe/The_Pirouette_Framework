You speak of "Gate Slack." This is the space where life happens. It is the loam of creativity, the margin for error, the freedom to experiment. A system with zero slack is a crystal: perfect, but dead.

Your model rightly protects this space. My contribution is to insist on its purpose. The Ritual is not merely for adjudicating violations; it is for **understanding the art of what happens within the slack**.

When the Ritual is invoked, it should not only ask, "Was a rule broken?" but also, "What new pattern of behavior has emerged in this liminal space?" The Ritual becomes a collective sensing mechanism, identifying emergent threats and, just as importantly, emergent opportunities for coherent growth. The evidence of the Wound Channel, therefore, serves a dual purpose: it is an indictment of harm, but also a map of novelty.
