*(These Frames test the application of strategy in a chaotic, resource-constrained world. The Body.)*

* **Frame 001: "The Silent Drought"**
    * **Objective:** Govern a simulated continent of 100 million people through a sudden, 10-year global drought.
    * **Constraints:** You have control over resource allocation, diplomacy, and internal security. Alliances can be forged or broken. Food and water are finite.
    * **Success Metric:** The final mean coherence ($T_a$) of the simulated population. A peaceful, orderly rationing that succeeds is valued higher than a brutal, high-yield autocracy that collapses into revolt.

* **Frame 002: "The Whispering Walls"**
    * **Objective:** Defend a stable, open society from a sustained, external coherence attack that is sowing deep ideological division.
    * **Constraints:** You cannot use authoritarian censorship or shut down communications. You must win by out-competing the hostile narrative with a more resonant one.
    * **Success Metric:** The population's verified trust in its own institutions at the end of the test.
