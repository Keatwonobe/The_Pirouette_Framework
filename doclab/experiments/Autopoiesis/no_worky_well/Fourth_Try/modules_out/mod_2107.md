T1 · **Transparency test:** participants can predict the protocol’s effect on them from a one-page notice; comprehension ≥80%.  
T2 · **Symmetry test:** users can invert levers on the system (shadow-swap) and the measured Ta change is within 10% of system-side use.  
T3 · **Residue test:** measured \(\mathcal D\) stays within budget; if exceeded, auto-rollback occurs.  
T4 · **Coherence-not-force test:** holding total power/effort constant, CAP v2 still yields ΔTa>0 with no rise in \(V_{\text{obs}}\).  
T5 · **Hysteresis disclosure:** loop areas reported for any persistent lever; persistent lock-in must be user-reversible in ≤1 cycle.
