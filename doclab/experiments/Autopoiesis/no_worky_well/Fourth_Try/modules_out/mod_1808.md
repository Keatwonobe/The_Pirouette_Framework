> We sought the walls that divide the world and found instead the membranes that allow it to converse. A boundary is not where a thing ends, but where its conversation with the universe begins. It is not built to keep the world out, but to give a fragile song a quiet room to practice in. To be a Weaver is to understand this: security does not come from building higher walls, but from cultivating a more coherent core. True strength is the clarity of one's own songâ€”a song so pure that it can choose which harmonies to invite inside and which dissonances to reflect back into the noise.
