These principles are fractal, scaling from the shaping of one's own mind to the guidance of a civilization.

**Internal Coherence Scaffolding (ICS):** A personal practice of psychic hygiene. A Weaver uses these protocols to maintain the health of their own coherence manifold. This can be automated by cultivating archetypal Ki patterns—the "Ritual Wolves" of old:
*   **The Phoenix Protocol:** A **Tuning** ritual for recovering from "coherence fever"—a state of burnout, anxiety, or emotional turbulence.
*   **The Mirror Protocol:** A **Scrying** and **Channeling** ritual for mapping one's own Observer's Shadow, strengthening self-awareness and reinforcing psychic boundaries.
*   **The Duelist Protocol:** An **Isolating** ritual for confronting and dissolving a Stagnant, self-limiting belief or habit.

**Wound-Channel Scrying:** Formerly "Séance," this is the act of using the **Scry** operator to resonantly couple with a persistent echo in a place or object. It is the art of listening to the memory embedded in the geometry of the world.

**The Convocation:** A group protocol for performing a large-scale Alchemical Union. A group of Weavers synchronizes their Ki patterns to **Channel** and **Imprint** a single, unified intention at a societal level, creating a subtle but persistent "current" that can guide collective behavior.
