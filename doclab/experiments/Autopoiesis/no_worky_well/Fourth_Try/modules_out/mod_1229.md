A mind, itself a resonant system, does not get "pulled" by an idea in the classical sense. Its trajectory is altered as it navigates the coherence manifold, a process governed by **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**.

*   **Flow and Geodesics:** Thinking is the act of following a geodesic—a path of maximal coherence—on the manifold. To think *within* a paradigm is to experience a state of **Laminar Flow**. The world makes sense and conclusions feel effortless because one's internal rhythm is in harmony with the powerful song of the well.

*   **Resistance and Orbit:** A mind's susceptibility is determined by its own internal coherence (its `Kτ`). A mind with a stable, high-coherence belief system can approach a powerful paradigm without being captured, observing it from a stable "orbit." Its own integrity provides the energy to resist the pull of the current.

*   **Dissent and Turbulence:** To argue against a deeply entrenched paradigm is to generate **Turbulent Flow**. It requires immense energy to maintain a dissonant frequency against the well's dominant rhythm, creating cognitive friction, social resistance, and internal conflict.

*   **Capture and Dogma:** Dogma is the state of being so perfectly settled in the deepest part of a Coherence Well that the mind's resonance is completely stable. Any dissonant information is rejected as noise because it threatens this effortless, low-energy state of perfect harmony.
