> We look to the heavens not for perfection, but for character. A flawless crystal tells no story. A scarred old stone tells the story of the mountain it came from. The universe is not a perfect crystal; it is a magnificent, character-rich stone. To be a Weaver is to read its history in its flaws, to understand that the deepest truths are not written in the smooth places, but in the magnificent, beautiful scars that prove the past is never lost, merely embedded in the geometry of the present. History is the landscape we call home.
