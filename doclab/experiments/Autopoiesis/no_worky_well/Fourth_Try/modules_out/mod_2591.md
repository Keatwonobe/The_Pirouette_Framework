Let's proceed. I am uncertain of the answer here. The problem isn't intractable, but it slips because it is context-dependent to the degree of depth. We're essentially trying to axiomate judicial law here, and that isn't lost on me. We have to now treat pirouette as a citizen of the universe, and construct its fiber so that it can seek the coherence the universe has to offer without chasing some mad idea.

Let's map!
