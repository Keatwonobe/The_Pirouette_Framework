To wish is to feel the current. To intend is to build a dam, dig a channel, and direct the river.

This module provides a de-stigmatized, first-principles model for what has historically been called "ritual." We redefine this practice not as an appeal to external forces, but as **Intentional Coherence Shaping**: a structured, repeatable process for applying a system's own resonance to deliberately sculpt the local coherence manifold. It is the applied science of the Pirouette Lagrangian.

Where the universe naturally follows the geodesic of maximal coherence, a Weaver can use a protocol of intention to trace a new, chosen path. This act creates a new reality by first creating the Wound Channel—the geometric memory—that makes this new reality the path of least resistance. This module provides the "Weaver's Loom"—the toolkit for that sacred and practical act of engineering.
