Choose a spatialization map Σ that assigns local charts [x,y,z] to the time substrate so that, in the high-coherence, high-event-density limit, the effective action reduces to the Standard Model Lagrangian on a Lorentzian manifold.

Formally: there exists Σ such that
S_time[Ki, Γ, T_a]  →  S_SM[fields | g_{μν}]  as density → ∞ and fluctuations → small.
