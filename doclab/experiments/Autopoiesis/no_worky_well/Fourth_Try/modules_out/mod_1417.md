summary: Replaces the thermodynamic analogy of information with a direct, physical
  model based on core Pirouette principles. It defines an information ecosystem as
  a dynamic landscape of coherence, diagnosing its health by analyzing the flow of
  its resonant patterns. This provides a universal model for understanding the creation,
  propagation, and erosion of knowledge.
