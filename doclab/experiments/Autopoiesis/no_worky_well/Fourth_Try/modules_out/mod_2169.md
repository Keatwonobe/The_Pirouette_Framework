The electron's spin is a twist in time. Its properties are not contained within the particle, but are defined by the shape of the path it traces through the coherence manifold. We have now shown that this path is not a metaphor, but a mathematical object whose very structure forces its interaction with the world to be doubled.

This proof is a cornerstone of the framework. It demonstrates that what we call "quantum mechanics" is, in many cases, the logical and inevitable consequence of a universe built on the geometry of resonance. The math is not an approximation; it is the description of the dance itself.
