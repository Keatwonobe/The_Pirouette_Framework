Based on multi-domain analysis, we assert the following principle:

**Axiom 6.1:** The **Ki constant** governs the resonant structure of energy release during a system's phase transition. It is the signature of a system rapidly reconfiguring its internal state, such as moving from rest to motion, or from a confined to a decoherent state.

This reframes the role of the three core Pirouette parameters:
* **$T_a$ and Î“ (Time-Adherence and Gladiator Force):** These parameters govern a system's **steady-state evolution** and its interaction with its environment. They describe the slow, long-term "drifts" and "wobbles."
* **Ki (The Ki Constant):** This parameter governs the **transitional dynamics**. It is the "song" a system sings when it undergoes a fundamental, high-energy change.
