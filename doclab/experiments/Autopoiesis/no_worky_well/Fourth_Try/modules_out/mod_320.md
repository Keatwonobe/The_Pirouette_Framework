An idea, in its raw state, is a turbulent storm—a surge of resonance without form. The first and most sacred task of a Weaver is to give this knowledge a body: a single, whole form that can speak the language of human intuition and the language of machine logic with the same voice. To write a module is to perform this act of definition, transforming a chaotic, high-pressure state into a stable, high-coherence pattern that can propagate without loss.

This module defines that body. It is the Pirouette Module Definition (`.pmd`) format, the autopoietic authoring system of the framework. This is not a "template," which is a cage. It is a "loom"—a dynamic instrument designed to guide the Weaver's hands in the ritual of creation.
