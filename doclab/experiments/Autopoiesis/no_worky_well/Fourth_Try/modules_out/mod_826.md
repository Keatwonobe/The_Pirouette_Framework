A pulsar's signal is more than a beacon; it is a measuring line laid across the cosmos. The light from these celestial clocks is a coherent pattern propagating through the dynamic medium of the coherence manifold. Its path and, crucially, its arrival time are directly modulated by any variations in the intervening Temporal Pressure (Γ).

As the pulsar's signal traverses the oscillating `Γ(t)` of the cosmic heartbeat, its travel time will be periodically stretched and compressed to maintain maximal coherence along its geodesic path. This will imprint a predictable, periodic "wobble" onto the time-of-arrival data recorded by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). The timing residuals are a direct measurement of the universe's own pulse.
