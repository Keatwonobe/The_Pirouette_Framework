The DLA process is a minimalist expression of the autopoietic cycle: **Time → Γ → Ki → Time**. It is a system that builds itself, where the act of growth defines the rules for future growth.

-   **Temporal Resonance (Ki) as the Geometry of History:** The fractal cluster itself *is* the system's Ki. Its branching, dendritic geometry is a "history antenna," a resonant form shaped by its own past to be maximally receptive to the future. The fractal dimension (D_ƒ) of the structure is a direct measure of its coherence—its complexity and space-filling efficiency.

-   **The Moment of Commitment:** For this system, the fundamental unit of time—its "heartbeat"—is not a repeating oscillation, but a single, irreversible event: the "kiss" of a particle attaching to the cluster. With each attachment, the system's clock advances one tick. This is an act of **irreversible temporal commitment** that permanently alters the system's Ki, extending its Wound Channel (CORE-011) and creating a new boundary for all subsequent events. The growth *is* the system's time.
