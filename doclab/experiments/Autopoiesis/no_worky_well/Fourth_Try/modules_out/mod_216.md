With the establishment of a stable, repeating Ki pattern, the final link of the autopoietic cycle (`CORE-001`) snaps into place. The duration of one complete cycle of this helical knot becomes the first meaningful quantum of time (τ_p). This closes the loop:

`Time (fluctuation) → Γ (pressure) → Ki (resonant knot) → Time (rhythm)`

The stability and clarity of this new rhythm is its **Temporal Coherence** (`CORE-005`), the modern understanding of the older concept of Time Adherence (T_a). It is a measure of how perfectly the knot sings its own note without decay. The universe is no longer silent; it has a heartbeat.
