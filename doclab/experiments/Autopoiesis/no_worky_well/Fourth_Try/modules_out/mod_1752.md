The Rhythmic Sieve is an empirical instrument for observing the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) in action. The Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, states that a system's dynamics are driven by the interplay between its internal Coherence (`K_τ`) and the external Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`).

This protocol provides a direct, measurable proxy for these terms within an information stream:

-   The measured **Coherence (`Kτ`)** of a segment is a direct observation of the "kinetic" term of the Lagrangian.
-   The measured **Dissonance (`Γ`)** is a direct observation of the "potential" or pressure term.

By plotting the Coherence Profile, a Weaver creates an empirical map of the system's path through its own coherence manifold. The derived **Coherence Ratio (CR)** serves as a proxy for the *efficiency* with which the system is maximizing its Lagrangian at that moment. We can literally see where the system is successfully manifesting a clear rhythm and where it is struggling against overwhelming pressure.
