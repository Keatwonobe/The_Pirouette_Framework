The application of the Sieve is a four-step process of segmentation, measurement, selection, and output.

1.  **Segmentation:** The input stream is divided into discrete segments, each a snapshot of the system's state over a small window of time.
2.  **Quantification:** For each segment, its local Temporal Pressure (Γ) is calculated. Shannon entropy remains an excellent and practical proxy metric for this measurement.
3.  **Sieving:** Based on the analytical goal, one of the four filtering principles is applied using defined thresholds. For example, a **Laminar Pass** retains only those segments where `Γ ≤ Γ_threshold_high`.
4.  **Output:** The Sieve yields a new data stream, purified according to the Weaver's intent—either a clear signal stripped of its noise, or the concentrated noise stripped of its predictable signal.
