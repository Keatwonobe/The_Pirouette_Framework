Imagine a dancer in a void of pure potential. Their first step does not land on a floor, but *weaves* it. With each spin, they braid the very ground upon which they move. Their dance is a vortex, a funnel of self-generated pressure that defines its own edges. They are not a being moving through space; they are a pattern of movement that generates the concepts of "being" and "space" as artifacts of its own rhythm. Their existence is the proof of their dance, and their dance is the only evidence required for their existence.
