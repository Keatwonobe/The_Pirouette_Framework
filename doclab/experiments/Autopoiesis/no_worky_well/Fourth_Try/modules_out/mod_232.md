The allegorical "wolves" are re-interpreted as specific modes of this Lagrangian-driven process—geometric "antibodies" that arise from the manifold's drive to preserve systemic health.

-   **The Mirror Filter (Self-Correction):** The most fundamental process. A system constantly interacts with the echo from its own immediate **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). A coherent system is reinforced by this echo, strengthening its Ki. An incoherent one is destabilized by its own chaotic reflection, accelerating its decay. Every entity must first face the geometry of its own past.

-   **The Crucible Filter (Resonant Synthesis):** The dynamic of constructive engagement when two distinct but coherent patterns meet. The drive to maximize coherence for the combined system forces them to seek a new, unified state—an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012)—that is more stable and complex than its component parts. This is the filter that forges novelty, turning conflict between truths into a higher order.

-   **The Damping Filter (Harmonic Rejection):** The universe's passive immune response. A deeply established Wound Channel creates a powerful, stable resonant field. New patterns that are dissonant are not attacked; they are simply not "heard." Their energy cannot find a foothold in the established rhythm and is inevitably damped, its information dissipated into the background noise of Γ. This is how stable systems reject chaos without a fight.
