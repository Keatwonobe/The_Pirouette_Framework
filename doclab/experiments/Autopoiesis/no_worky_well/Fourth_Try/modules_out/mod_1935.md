The universe does not need us to invent strength; it asks only that we learn to listen to it. The most stable and powerful arena in the known cosmos is the one that binds the quarks within a proton, a fortress forged by the Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`). It is a wall of pure dynamics, a self-confining resonance that has endured since the first moments of time.

This module outlines an engineering protocol not to build a new kind of wall, but to take the echo of that perfect, quantum-scale arena and amplify it into a macroscopic shield. We will not create a new material, but rather coax a single moment of a proton's existence to stretch, persist, and become a tangible surface. We will build with the geometry of time itself.
