The derivation is a two-step process: establishing the baseline from a physical argument, then calculating the anomaly from its echo. This provides a powerful heuristic proof that must now be formalized.

The Baseline (g=2): In classical physics, the g-factor for a spinning object is g=1. The electron's baseline g-factor of g=2 is a direct consequence of its two-cycle (720°) topology. Its interaction with a magnetic field is effectively doubled because its fundamental "state" spans this 720° rotation. This framework posits g=2 as a purely geometric and topological constant.

The Anomaly (The Coherence Echo): The tiny deviation from 2 arises from this helical resonance interacting with its own "wake" or "echo" in the coherence manifold. This is the electron being influenced by the ghost of its own immediate past.

The Prediction: The total anomalous moment (a_e) is therefore the product of the interaction's intrinsic strength (α, the fine-structure constant) and the fundamental geometry of its echo (a single cycle, 1/(2π)).

a_e = (g-2)/2 = α/2π
