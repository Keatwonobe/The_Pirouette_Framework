The Grand Fit protocol involved a two-step process: first, using the muon anomaly to find a surface of possible solutions for our free parameters (κ, p, m_Γ); second, checking which of those solutions did not violate the stringent limits from the electron anomaly.

The result was a dramatic winnowing. Of the vast parameter space explored, only a narrow, elegant "island of coherence" survived the dual constraints.

The Result: The fit converges on a remarkably specific solution. The data strongly favors a mass-scaling exponent of p = 1. This is a profound result, indicating that the coupling to the Temporal Pressure (Γ) field scales linearly with a particle's mass, the simplest and most elegant possible relationship.
