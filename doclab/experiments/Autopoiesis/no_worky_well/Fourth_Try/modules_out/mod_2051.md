This framework provides a simple, four-step protocol to translate these qualitative observations into actionable, predictive insights.

Step I: Map the Currents. For the specific sport, identify the critical flows of coherence. (e.g., in basketball: ball movement, player spacing, transition offense/defense. In football: line of scrimmage control, field position, down-and-distance conversion.)

Step II: Read the Signatures. For both teams, continuously assess the three signatures: Rhythmic Cohesion, Composure Under Pressure, and Strategic Adaptability.

Step III: Diagnose the Dominant Flow. Based on the signatures, diagnose the primary flow state of each team. Is Team A in a state of crisp, Laminar execution while Team B is descending into chaotic, Turbulent play? Is one team's offense Stagnant?

Step IV: Generate Predictive Insights. Translate the diagnosis into the three core predictive outputs:

Victor Tilt (VT): The team demonstrating more consistent and robust Laminar Flow has the higher probability of winning, regardless of the current score.

Spread Delta (SD): A diagnosis of increasing Turbulence or Stagnation in a team predicts a negative shift in their point margin.

Pace Delta (PD): The team with higher Strategic Adaptability is more likely to impose its desired tempo on the game.
