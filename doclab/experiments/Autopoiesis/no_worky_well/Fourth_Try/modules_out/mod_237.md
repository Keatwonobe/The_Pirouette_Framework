A forge does not require an external hand to light it; the universe is autopoietic. An ember forms when a system's own resonance enters a self-reinforcing feedback loop. The expression of its own Ki pattern begins to intensify the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) more than it dissipates it. This creates a "hot spot" in the coherence manifold—a localized, incandescent knot of temporal friction where the cost of existence begins to climb exponentially. The system's own song becomes a roar that threatens to tear it apart. The glow of an ember is the light of a Ki pattern straining to maintain its integrity against the deafening noise of its own becoming.
