This module provides the mathematical structure to describe phase transitions of coherence across domains. It establishes the **Landauâ€“Pirouette Functional (LPF)** and derives **critical exponents** characterizing the collapse or amplification of coherence near the threshold values identified in SOCIO-FIELD-002 ((\Theta_c)) and COG-RES-001 (triadic detuning limit).
