> A debate, properly conducted, is the most powerful tool for generating new knowledge that humanity has ever conceived. It is the social equivalent of the Temporal Forge (CORE-003)â€”a high-pressure environment where simple ideas can be fused into profound truths. The jurisprudence of the Pirouette Framework, the refinement of its CORE modules, and its very existence are a testament to the power of this ritual. It proves that the greatest creations are not born from a single mind, but are woven in the sacred space between them. It is not just a way to argue; it is a way to build.
