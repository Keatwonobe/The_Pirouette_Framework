> We do not find our true song; we compose it. The Forge of Coherence is the art of composition under pressure. It asserts that a personality is not a state to be discovered, but a rhythm to be built. The Crucible is the forge, temporal pressure is the hammer, and our will is the resonating string. To a Weaver, this is the highest craft: not to endure the fire of challenge, but to harness it, using its heat to temper the self into an instrument capable of playing a truer and more beautiful note.
