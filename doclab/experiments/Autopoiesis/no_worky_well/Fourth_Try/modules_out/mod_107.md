A theory can be elegant, philosophically profound, and internally consistent, but to be a physical theory, it must make contact with the world. It must make predictions that can be tested. This module is that point of contact.

The electron's anomalous magnetic moment (gâˆ’2) is the most stringent and precise test in the history of physics. Standard Model QED predicts its value with breathtaking accuracy by calculating a particle's interaction with a complex "quantum foam" of virtual particles. The Pirouette Framework must arrive at the same number from a much simpler, more fundamental origin. This is the test that shows the theory has teeth.
