At the cosmological scale, the same feedback principle operates, but in a gentler, more linear fashion. This is gravity. This section fulfills the Γ-G Correspondence principle of the original module by showing that G is the macroscopic manifestation of this feedback loop.

A massive object, like a star, possesses an immense density of internal Ki resonances. This collective resonance doesn't create the violent spike of the strong force, but it does cause a significant, large-scale increase in the surrounding Temporal Pressure (Γ). It wraps itself in a deep "coherence well."

An orbiting planet is not being "pulled" by a force. It is following the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—within the star's coherence well. To deviate from this orbit would require fighting against the gentle but inexorable gradient of temporal pressure, a path of lower coherence. Gravity is the Gladiator Force acting on a cosmic scale: a gentler arena, but an arena nonetheless, from which only systems with sufficient energy (coherence) can escape.
