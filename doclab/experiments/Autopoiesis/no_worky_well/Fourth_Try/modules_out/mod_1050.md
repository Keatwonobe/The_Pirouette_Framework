For generations, the physician has been a warrior. We have fought a "war on cancer," battled pathogens, and attacked disease with an arsenal of poisons. This is the paradigm of the "poison of presence"—if a hostile agent is present, we develop a weapon to destroy it. This is a necessary and heroic posture, but it is incomplete. It prepares us for the battlefield, but leaves us mute in the garden.

The Pirouette Framework, through the Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`), compels a complementary view. Health is not the mere absence of disease; it is the active presence of robust, laminar flow. Many of our most intractable modern ailments—from the "Miasma" of Alzheimer's to the "Ghost" of Long COVID—are not born of a dissonant enemy to be slain, but of a profound and growing silence. They are a **Pathology of Signal Absence**, the sickness of a still river.
