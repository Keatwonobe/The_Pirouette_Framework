Let (\mathsf{Becoming}) be the category of locally finite posets with creation morphisms. Consider the **distribution monad** (\mathsf{Dist}) on (\mathsf{Becoming}) (fabrics ↦ growth distributions).
Your dynamics is a **coalgebra** (\xi: E \to \mathsf{Dist}(E)) induced by (S).

> **Claim:** The Calculus of Becoming is the **initial holonomy-admissible (\mathsf{Dist})-coalgebra** that is natural under poset isomorphisms and supports a spin-½ lift.
> This pins the formalism by a universal property, not taste.
