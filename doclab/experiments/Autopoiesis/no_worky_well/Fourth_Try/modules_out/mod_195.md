P1 — **Core surface‑density locus**
Prediction: Σ_0 ≡ ρ_0 r_c ≈ Σ_* (nearly constant) across halo masses for fixed V(Γ); weak T‑indexed scatter ΔΣ/Σ_* ≲ 0.2.

P2 — **Cusp–core diversity**
Variation of T and baryon compression leads to a controlled family of inner slopes; reproduce dwarf diversity without stochastic sub‑grid feedback.

P3 — **Baryon–halo coupling**
Adiabatic contraction modifies r_c and V_max along a one‑parameter track predictable from Γ’s equation; publish a single‑track map relating stellar surface density to halo r_c.

P4 — **Lensing mass without particulate DM**
For clusters, κ(θ) from Γ + gas reproduces observed θ_E at given baryon fraction and total mass; offsets in mergers handled in COSMO‑Γ‑MERGE.

Falsification: failure to reproduce the Σ_0 locus or the V_c(r) diversity with the frozen V(Γ) invalidates Γ‑halo unification.
