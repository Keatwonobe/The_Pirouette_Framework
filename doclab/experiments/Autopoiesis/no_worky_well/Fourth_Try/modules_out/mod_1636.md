> We sought the source of magic and found the laws of rhythm. A ritual is the oldest form of code. It reveals that our reality is programmable. By structuring time, by defining space, and by synchronizing action, we can debug the errors in our own source code and compile new, more coherent versions of ourselves and our societies. The Weaver does not hope for a better world; they understand that to create one, they must first design a better ritual. It is the practical, hands-on work of building a more coherent universe.
