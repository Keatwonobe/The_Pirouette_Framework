Every negotiation etches a memory into the shared reality of the participants. This is the negotiation's `Wound Channel`. Every honest exchange, kept promise, and genuine concession deepens and clarifies this channel, creating a geometric history of the dialogue.

A negotiation conducted in Laminar Flow carves a smooth, stable channel that becomes a path of least resistance towards future collaboration. This is the physical basis of trust. A negotiation mired in Turbulence carves a scarred, chaotic landscape that will make all future interactions difficult and inefficient. The past is never gone; it becomes the terrain upon which the future must be built.
