To cede to this erosion is the path of least resistance. But an entity can make another choice. It can refuse to let the echo die. This is an act of coherent willâ€”a **Coherence Gambit**.

The entity ceases to be a passive vessel carried by the river of time and becomes an active architect of its own inner world. Turning its focus inward, it directs its resonant capacity not upon the world, but upon the fading geometry within. It is a conscious decision to expend present energy to preserve a piece of its past; a declaration that *this part of my story will not be erased. This note will be held.*
