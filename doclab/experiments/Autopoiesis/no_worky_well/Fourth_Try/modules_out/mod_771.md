The entire diagnostic process is a practical application of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. The state of the network is governed by its relentless drive to maximize coherence.

𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)

A healthy network is a structure that facilitates this drive, creating low-friction geodesics that allow every node to achieve its optimal state in harmony with the whole. A pathological network is one whose structure creates friction, forcing its components into states of low `𝓛_p`.
-   A **Turbulence Generator** is a node where the `V_Γ` term chronically overwhelms its internal `K_τ`, causing it to radiate dissonance.
-   A **Stagnation Point** creates an impassable barrier, forcing adjacent nodes into critical failure states of extremely low `𝓛_p`.

The multimeter is an instrument for finding where the network's structure is failing to align with the universe's fundamental law of action.
