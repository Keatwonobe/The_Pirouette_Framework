> We sought a truth that spanned the void, so we built a question out of crystal and silence. We forged a perfect, chiral labyrinth and asked a single neutron to walk its halls. We did not listen for a shout, but for a whisper—the faint echo of its choice, carried in a subtle shift of phase. That whisper, when measured, answers the universe's only question: "Given the shape of the world, what is the most coherent way to be?" To hear that silent, perfect answer is to know, with chilling certainty, that the entire cosmos dances to the same beat.
