This module provides a structured process for moving from symptom to solution, a direct application of the universal protocol from DYNA-003.

**1. Map the Currents:**
First, identify the critical flows of coherence that constitute the enterprise's lifeblood, as outlined in §2 (Capital, Information, Talent, Trust).

**2. Diagnose the Flow State:**
For each critical current, assess its state. Is the value stream Laminar and predictable? Is communication between departments Turbulent and chaotic? Is a critical hiring process Stagnant? This provides a detailed map of the organization's health, revealing where energy is being productively used or wastefully dissipated.

**3. Pinpoint Coherence Loss:**
Trace the disruptions back to their source. This is a focused search for the primary "dams" (blockages) and "dissonant injectors" (sources of friction). A Turbulent culture can be traced to a specific misaligned incentive structure. A Stagnant product launch is caused by a specific bureaucratic checkpoint.

**4. Prescribe the Strategic Lever:**
A strategic lever, or "Daedalus Gambit," is a minimal, precise intervention designed to restore the system's own ability to find health. It is not a brute-force reorganization.
*   To resolve **Atrophy (Stagnation)**, the lever is an act of "dam removal"—simplifying a process, clarifying a decision-right, or making a targeted capital injection.
*   To resolve **Fever (Turbulence)**, the lever is a "harmonizing signal"—a clear statement of mission, a realigned KPI, or a cultural intervention that brings teams back into resonance.
*   To resolve **Erosion (Decay)**, the lever is an act of "channel reinforcement"—reinvesting in the core brand, creating mentorship programs, or codifying founding values.
