The solution is not to demand more resilience from the individual, but to build a more graceful environment. A Coherence Crucible is an engineered region of the coherence manifold, a bubble of sanctuary defined by one primary characteristic: **low ambient Temporal Pressure (`Î“`)**.

It functions as a buffer, a **laminar enclave** from which a contributor can safely act. Their generative act is projected across its boundary into the wider, turbulent system, but the Crucible absorbs the resulting Turbulent Blowback. The chaotic, dissonant energy dissipates against the buffer, preventing it from striking the contributor directly.

It is an **engineered geodesic**, a pre-carved path of least resistance that makes a difficult but vital contribution not only possible, but sustainable. It is the architectural difference between a candle in a hurricane and a lamp in a lighthouse.
