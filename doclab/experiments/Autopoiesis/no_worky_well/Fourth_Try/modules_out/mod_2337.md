children: [MATH-019 (Dictionary), MATH-020 (Non‑Perturbative Solvers)]
summary: "Lock in Pirouette’s predictive status by replacing any post‑hoc calibration or ad‑hoc functional choices with symmetry‑fixed structure, preregistered forecasts, and reproducible validation. This module is **normative** and applies globally unless a child module explicitly supersedes it with proofs. Scope
• Lepton g−2, QED recoveries, portal corrections, running α, EDMs, hyperfine splittings.
• Extends to strongly‑coupled and gravitational limits via RG/soliton tracks.
