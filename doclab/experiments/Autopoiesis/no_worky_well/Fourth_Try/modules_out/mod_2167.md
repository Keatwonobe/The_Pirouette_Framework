To find the g-factor, we must describe how this resonance interacts with an external magnetic field B. The energy of this interaction is described by a term in the system's Hamiltonian, H_int.

H_int = -mu . B

Here, mu is the particle's magnetic moment, which is proportional to its spin angular momentum S. The g-factor is the constant of proportionality between them:

mu = g * (e / 2m) * S

Where e is the elementary charge and m is the mass of the electron. Our goal is to prove that for our topological resonance, g must be 2.
