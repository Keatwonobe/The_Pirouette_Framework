summary: Defines the time-first governance protocol for the Pirouette Framework itself.
  It reframes evolution not as a political process, but as a dynamic, autopoietic
  ritual for maintaining and enhancing the framework's systemic coherence. Change
  is treated as a proposed 'coherence injection,' integrated via a process of resonant
  synthesis guided by the Principle of Maximal Coherence and a Temporal Stability
  Clause.
