Boundaries are not prisons but canvases for emergence. The “Gate Slack” is our creative margin, and the **Reflexive Ritual** is our collective studio. Through the Ritual, we both judge and learn—from the harm mapped by the Wound Channel and from the novel patterns that arise within the slack. In this way, our system nurtures innovation while safeguarding coherence.
