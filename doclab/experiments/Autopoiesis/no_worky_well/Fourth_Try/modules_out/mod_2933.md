Taming a wild beast is not an act of domination, but a contest of willsâ€”a conversation without words.

The Process: To tame a creature, a character must engage it in a "conversation." This involves a series of contested checks (typically the tamer's WIS vs. the beast's WIS). The tamer must "win" this conversation a number of times equal to the beast's WIS Score.

The Beast's Will: A wild creature does not wish to be tamed. During this contest, the beast adds its CON Score to its roll, representing its raw, instinctual resistance to being controlled. A tamer must overcome not just the beast's mind, but its very nature.
