* If measured exponents deviate systematically from ((0,1/2,1,3)), Pirouette universality is falsified.
* If (\xi_P) or (\tau_P) do not scale with the predicted powers, the LPF must include higher-order substrate coupling terms.
* If cross-domain coupling fails (no g_ij invariance), universality breaks down.
