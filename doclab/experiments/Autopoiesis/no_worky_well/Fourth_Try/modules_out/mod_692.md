Flow is the most efficient metabolic state in the framework. Perfect temporal resonance (`Δτ ≈ 0`) maximizes the system's ability to process reality without internal friction, creating a self-reinforcing loop of coherence and satisfying the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

In this state, the agent's forward motion through time is perfectly aligned with the flow of the manifold. Energy is no longer expended fighting against temporal turbulence; instead, the agent draws momentum directly from the coherence of the channel itself. The subjective feeling of "effortlessness" is the direct experience of a near-lossless energetic cycle, where the act of perception seamlessly fuels the act of creation.
