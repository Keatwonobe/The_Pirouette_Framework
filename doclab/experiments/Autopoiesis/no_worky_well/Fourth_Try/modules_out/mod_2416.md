With size L and observation time T:

ξ ~ L at pseudo-criticality,  τ_P ~ L^{z_P}

Dynamic exponent z_P depends on conservation laws (Model A/B-like):

z_P ≈ 2 (non-conserved ψ);  z_P ≈ 3 (with Γ-coupled slow modes)

Predictions for collapse/recovery kinetics in COG (awareness lapses) and SOCIO (post-shock relaxation) follow τ_P scaling.
