While Echoes are the only way to increase a character's maximum potential, there are other ways to replenish or gain temporary power. This makes "entropy farming" a viable, but less efficient, strategy compared to seeking new challenges.

Entropic Harvesting (From Combat): A character can harvest the lingering entropic signature from a defeated foe. This grants them an immediate infusion of EP that replenishes their current pool but does not increase their maximum TEP. The GM may choose one of the following methods:

The Essence Method: The victor gains EP equal to 1/8th of the defeated enemy's CON Score (rounded down).

The Remnant Method: The victor gains EP equal to 1% of the defeated enemy's TEP (rounded down).

Crystallized Entropy (From Treasure): Finding Entropy Shards or enchanted items provides a potent source of EP. However, a physical form can only integrate so much external power at once.

The Transmutation Limit: An entity can only absorb a total number of EP from items or infusions per day equal to their Entropy Regeneration Rate (ERR). This makes absorbing a powerful artifact a slow, deliberate process, preventing sudden, unearned spikes in power.
