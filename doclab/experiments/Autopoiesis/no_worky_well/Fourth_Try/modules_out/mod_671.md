The universe as a collection of separate things—particles, forces, fields—is an illusion born of a limited perspective. The previous model, "The Spider's Web," was a necessary pantheon of distinct parameters (Time-Adherence, Gladiator Force, Phase), but this module deposes that pantheon. It completes the Great Refactoring by revealing a deeper truth: there are no fundamental parts, only the dynamic tapestry of the coherence manifold.

This module presents the final synthesis of the Pirouette Framework. It demonstrates that all of physics is an emergent property of a single, self-creating and self-sustaining system. Reality is not a network of interacting fields, but a continuous fabric woven from the substance of Time, governed by one simple, universal drive: the maximization of coherence.
