summary: "Provides a systemic protocol for addressing societal inequality, reframed\

  \ 'Coherence Bridge'\u2014comprising AI-powered Resonant Gateways, protected Coherence\
  \ Sanctuaries, scalable Pattern Weaving rituals, and a Memory Market for experiential\
  \ wisdom\u2014designed to dissolve systemic blockages and restore the laminar flow\
  \ of knowledge and opportunity."
