By combining these invariant motifs under the architectural constraints of the Nomad's Grammar, we arrive at the minimal, symmetry-derived form for the Temporal Pressure manifold, `V_Γ`.

$$
V_Γ(Γ, φ_{ij}) = \lambda_Γ(Γ - Γ₀)² + \lambda_φ \sum_{i<j} [1 - \cos(φ_{ij})] + V_{couple}
$$

-   The first term is the environmental cost. `φ_{ij}` is the relative phase between behavioral axes `i` and `j` from the Nomad's Grammar.
-   The second term is the cost of internal dissonance between the axes, creating the stable corners in the behavioral landscape.
-   `V_{couple}` represents the crucial coupling terms between the axes and the environment. The simplest such term is `λ_c (Γ - Γ₀) \cos(φ_{ij})`, capturing the non-linear reality that the cost of being out of phase is magnified when a system is also outside its optimal environmental pressure.

Each coefficient has a clear physical meaning and is experimentally measurable:
*   `λ_Γ`: **Pressure Curvature.** How sensitive the system is to its environment.
*   `λ_φ`: **Phase Coupling.** The strength of the "grip" that locks a system into a coherent behavioral state.
*   `λ_c`: **Manifold Shear.** The degree to which environmental pressure and internal phase are coupled.
