Define the effective Ki as
\[
K_i^{\rm eff}(v,\Gamma,T_a)
=K_{i,\text{rest}}
+ \Delta K_i\,\sigma[\alpha(\Xi-\Xi_c)],
\]
with logistic switch σ and composite driver \(\Xi(\dot\phi,\Gamma,T_a)\).
Crossing \(\Xi_c\) triggers the **snap**—a topological shift from the 4π manifold to the 2π triadic manifold.
This tether-snap pair forms the microscopic analog of the cosmological 4π↔2π “kick.”
