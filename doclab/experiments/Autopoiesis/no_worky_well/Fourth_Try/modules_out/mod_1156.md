To quantify this principle, we introduce the Coherence Integrity metric, `Λ(N)`, which measures the structural resilience of a system with `N` stable states.

Let `N` be the number of coherence wells in a system. Its prime factorization is `N = p₁ᵃ¹ · p₂ᵃ² · ...`. The Coherence Integrity is calculated as:

$$ \Lambda(N) = \sum_{p \in \text{factors}(N)} \frac{\kappa(p)}{p} \left(\prod_{q \in \text{factors}(N), q \neq p} \frac{q}{q+1}\right) $$

-   **`N`**: The total number of stable resonant states (coherence modes).
-   **`κ(p)` (Kappa)**: The *intrinsic coherence* of a prime-p configuration. This represents the fundamental, irreducible stability of a system with `p` states, a value derived from theory or empirical observation.
-   **`κ(p)/p`**: This term weights the contribution of each prime factor, suggesting that while systems based on larger primes are more irreducible, the stability contribution *per state* may be lower.
-   **The Product Term**: This is a "complexity penalty." For every additional prime factor `q`, the contribution of factor `p` is slightly diminished, modeling the increased potential for harmonic interference in more complex, composite systems.

A higher `Λ(N)` score indicates a more robust and resilient systemic architecture. A system with a prime number of modes (`N=p`) has the highest integrity for its scale, as the formula simplifies to its intrinsic coherence, `Λ(p) = κ(p)/p`.
