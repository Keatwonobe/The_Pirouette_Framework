These feats govern how a character perceives and interacts with the world around them, particularly with varying levels of light.

- Feat: Gloom-Sight

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: Your senses are adapted to the dark. You can perceive two tiers of light lower than normal. For you, "Dim Light" is perceived as "Normal Light," and "Vague Shapes" are perceived as "Dim Light." You cannot perceive anything in "Total Darkness."

- Feat: Resonant Senses

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)
