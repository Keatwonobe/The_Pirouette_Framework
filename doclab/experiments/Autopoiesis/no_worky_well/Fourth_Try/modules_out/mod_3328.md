This module specifies the **Triaxial Semantic Sensor**, a Python script that implements Phase 1 of the Universal Ki-Signature Detection Protocol (`PPS-064`). Its purpose is to ingest any raw text document and transduce it into a standardized, multivariate time-series representing the evolution of the three core Pirouette fields. It achieves this by segmenting the text and, for each segment, calculating robust proxy metrics for Time-Adherence ($T_a$), Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$), and Phase ($\phi$). The output of this script serves as the standardized input for the **Ki-Signature Analyzer (`TEN-KID-1.0`)**.
