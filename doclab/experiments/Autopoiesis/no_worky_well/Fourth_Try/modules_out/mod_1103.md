A system at criticality embodies the autopoietic cycle, operating in a unique, punctuated rhythm of tension and release. This rhythm can be understood as a breath.

1.  **The Slow Inhale (Laminar Buildup):** The system continuously absorbs energy, matter, or information from its environment. This influx steadily increases the local Temporal Pressure (Γ), as described in *The Temporal Forge* (`CORE-003`). For a time, the system accommodates this rising pressure coherently, a period of Laminar Flow (`DYNA-001`) that stores the potential for future action.

2.  **The Held Breath (The Critical State):** The system reaches its angle of repose—a state of maximal temporal tension. Its resonant pattern (Ki) can no longer coherently contain the immense local Γ. It is poised on a knife-edge on the coherence manifold, where any further input threatens to shatter its stability. This is the moment of the held breath, pregnant with the possibility of imminent, radical change.

3.  **The Sudden Exhale (The Coherence Cascade):** A single input pushes the system over the edge, triggering a **coherence cascade**. The system’s Ki pattern shatters, and the stored temporal pressure is released in a burst of Turbulent Flow (`DYNA-001`). This chaotic avalanche resets the system to a sub-critical state, purging its excess pressure so the cycle can begin anew. This entire process—buildup, criticality, and release—constitutes a single, macro-scale Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`).
