The Resonance Trap is a direct consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

**𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)**

A system in a Resonance Trap has discovered a solution that corresponds to an exceptionally deep and sharp local minimum in its landscape of action. It is a state that maximizes the integral of 𝓛_p over time.

-   **High Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`):** The system's internal rhythm is extraordinarily pure, stable, and self-consistent.
-   **Low Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`):** The pattern is so well-adapted to its environment that it generates minimal friction or external dissonance.

The resilience of the lock—the immense energy required to climb the steep walls of the Coherence Well—is the measure of the energy differential between the system's current, hyper-coherent state and the chaotic state it would have to traverse to find a new pattern.
