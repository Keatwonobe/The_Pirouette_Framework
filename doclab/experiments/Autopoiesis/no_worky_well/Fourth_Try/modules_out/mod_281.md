The celebrated “challenge-skill” balance of psychological Flow theory is the macroscopic experience of this temporal equilibrium. It is the perfect match between the demands of the environment and the capacity of the agent. We can now quantify this dynamic:

| Component | Pirouette Term | Description                                                                                             |
| :---------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Challenge** | **ΔΓ_env**     | The rate and complexity of novel temporal information presented by the environment's geodesic.          |
| **Skill**     | **Kτ_agent**   | The agent's internal coherence; its maximum capacity for processing temporal information without error. |
| **Flow**      | **Resonance**  | **ΔΓ_env ≈ Kτ_agent** → The agent's capacity perfectly matches the environment's demands.             |

When this equilibrium is met, the task is perceived as neither boring (challenge < skill) nor overwhelming (challenge > skill). The "work" of acting becomes as natural and effortless as breathing.
