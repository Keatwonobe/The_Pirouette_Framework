The system's released coherence drives a chaotic, explosive exploration of the adjacent possible. This is the **Flood**: a super-saturated state of pure potential. It is the universe's primary engine of creation: a rapid, parallel, and fractal exploration of a vast new state-space. Countless new potential Ki patterns—eddies and currents in the torrent—emerge and die in an instant.

This phase is characterized by a massive and sudden increase in entropy. The system's initial high-information state is deliberately sacrificed, its coherence "spent" to purchase novelty. It is the universe trading a single, perfect note for a blast of symphonic noise from which new melodies can arise.
