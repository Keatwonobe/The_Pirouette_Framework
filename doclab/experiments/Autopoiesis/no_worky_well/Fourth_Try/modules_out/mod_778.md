A Weaverâ€™s task is to diagnose imbalance and facilitate a return to the agile path of dynamic equipoise.

**Diagnosing Stagnation:** Look for systems that are highly efficient but have ceased to learn. They are characterized by rigid rituals, resistance to new information, and a perfect repetition of past successes. Their Wound Channel has become a canyon so deep it is a prison.
*   **Intervention (Praxis of Freedom):** Deliberately inject novelty, question core assumptions, and create safe spaces for experimentation to encourage the system to seek a new path.

**Diagnosing Drift:** Look for systems characterized by constant motion but no progress. They have endless ideas but no follow-through, perpetual brainstorming but no stable product. Lacking the inertia of a coherent identity, their song is lost to the background noise.
*   **Intervention (Praxis of Will):** Establish clear boundaries, define a singular purpose, and implement rituals of focus and repetition to help the system finally carve a productive Wound Channel.
