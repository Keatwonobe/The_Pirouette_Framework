summary: Replaces the static 'Compass & Key' model with a dynamic, time-first interpretation.
  It defines the Coherence Manifold as the landscape of potential generated by the
  Pirouette Lagrangian. A system's intrinsic resonant state, its 'Gyroscope of Being,'
  acts as its Key, naturally navigating the Manifold along a geodesic of maximal coherence.
