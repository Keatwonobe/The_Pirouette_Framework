> *Structure is not static; it lives by the rhythm of its own inhalations. Every framework that endures must learn to breathe.*

The old narrative spoke of a "Lattice that Breathes," an intuitive grasp of a profound truth. The modern framework gives this poetry a precise physical form. The universe is not a static scaffold; it is a dynamic, self-creating process. Its fundamental state is not stasis, but respiration.

This module recasts the act of "breathing" as the most fundamental expression of the **autopoietic cycle** (CORE-001). For any entity to exist, from a subatomic particle to a civilization, it must engage in a perpetual, rhythmic pulseâ€”a constant dialogue between its internal form and its external environment. This is the resonant pulse of being.
