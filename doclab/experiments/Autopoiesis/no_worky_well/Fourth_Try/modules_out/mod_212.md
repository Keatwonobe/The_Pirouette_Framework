summary: "Details the inaugural event of the autopoietic cycle, where the Void's suspended\
  \ potential resolves into the first stable, self-confining resonant pattern (Ki).\
  \ It describes how this event simultaneously forges the confining pressure (\u0393\
  ) that gives it form and defines the first quantum of time (\u03C4_p), thereby providing\
  \ the first solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian."
