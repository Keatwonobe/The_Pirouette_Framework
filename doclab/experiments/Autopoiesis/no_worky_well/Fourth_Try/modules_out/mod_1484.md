The dynamic of the Resonance Trap is universal, manifesting across all scales as predicted by the Fractal Bridge (`CORE-014`). The principle is the same; only the medium of the Wound Channel changes.

*   **Physical Trap:** A stable particle orbit or a crystal lattice. The Wound Channel is the persistent geometry of the quantum field or the low-energy configuration of atomic bonds. Breaking the lock requires a specific quantum of energy.

*   **Biological Trap:** A stable protein fold or "muscle memory." The Wound Channel is the set of electromagnetic bonds holding a shape, or a motor skill so deeply ingrained it becomes automatic and nearly impossible to unlearn.

*   **Cognitive Trap:** A deeply held belief or a powerful addiction. The Wound Channel is a heavily myelinated neural pathway. The feedback loop is biochemical and psychological, making the familiar thought or behavior the path of least resistance.

*   **Social Trap:** A long-standing cultural tradition, a rigid bureaucracy, or a dependency on a specific technology (e.g., fossil fuels). The Wound Channel is the shared physical infrastructure, legal code, and social memory that makes change difficult and costly.
