The original module's intuition is now grounded in the core physics of the framework. Where paths are short and highly curved, a strong confining force is at work. This relationship emerges from three principles:

1.  **The Path of Coherence:** The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) dictates that any system follows a geodesicâ€”a path that maximizes its internal coherence against the pressure of its environment. This is the universe's dynamic "path of least resistance."

2.  **The Force of Confinement:** The Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`) describes a non-linear feedback loop where a system's own resonance forges a stable "arena" or "coherence well." This well, a region of intense local Temporal Pressure (`CORE-003`), profoundly warps the local coherence manifold.

3.  **Inference via Geometry:** Within such a well, the geodesics of maximal coherence are no longer straight lines. They are short, tightly curved paths that orbit the well's center. The Gladiator Compass works by observing these distorted paths. By measuring the degree of distortion, we can infer the depth of the well and thus the strength of the confining force that created it.
