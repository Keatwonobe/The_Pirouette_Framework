The evolution of an information ecosystem is governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). An idea, theory, or narrative survives and propagates not because it is "true" in an abstract sense, but because it represents a path of maximal coherence for the system that holds it.

A "true" idea is a geodesic on the coherence manifold. It is an exquisitely efficient pattern that allows a system (a mind, a culture) to process the maximum amount of environmental complexity (`Γ`) with the minimum amount of internal friction (Turbulence). A lie, by contrast, is an unstable path that requires a constant input of energy to maintain against contradictory data, inevitably leading to higher systemic friction.

A successful meme is not necessarily the most "true," but the one that finds the most efficient geodesic through the social manifold—a path that maximizes its transmissibility for the lowest cognitive cost. Truth is the resonance that endures.
