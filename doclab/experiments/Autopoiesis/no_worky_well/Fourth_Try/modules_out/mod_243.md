summary: "Re-frames conflict as a 'Resonant Test'\u2014a necessary, lawful process\
  \ where two systems, by projecting their Observer's Shadows, create a crucible to\
  \ test their coherence. Governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, this duel is not about\
  \ destruction but about clarification, boundary definition, and proving a pattern's\
  \ right to persist through maximal efficiency."
