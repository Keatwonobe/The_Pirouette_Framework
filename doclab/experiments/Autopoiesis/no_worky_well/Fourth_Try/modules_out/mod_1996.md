To the family member or friend assisting in this recovery: your role becomes one of profound trust. You were the Pacesetter. You are now the Spotter. In a gym, a spotter doesn't lift the weight for their partner. They stand ready, offering safety and encouragement, allowing the lifter to confidently approach their limit. That is your purpose now.

Your three primary functions are:

To Be the Guardian of the Edge: You will help the patient find the "hormetic zone"â€”the sweet spot between a productive challenge and a harmful strain. Your watchful presence allows them to explore this edge safely.

To Be the Voice of "Enough": The patient's will may now be stronger than their body's readiness. Your job is to be the loving, objective voice that says, "That was a great effort. Let's rest now."

To Be the Analyst: The Coherence Ledger becomes richer in this phase. You will help the patient not just record the data, but interpret it, looking for the patterns that signal readiness for the next small step.
