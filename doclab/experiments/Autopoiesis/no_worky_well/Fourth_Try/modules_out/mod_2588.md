* She agrees with you fully: *“Tightening increases phase error. You’ll lock up poets and prophets in the name of control.”*
* But she refuses Aurelius’ premise:

  * “You can’t dismantle the system from outside. You need **inside feedback nodes** that loop Velcrid noise into coherent restructuring.”

She proposes:

1. **Resonant Probation:**
   Prisoners generate social feedback in monitored entropy simulations. If their resonance improves local coherence (reduced complaint entropy, improved semantic delta), they’re tagged for reintegration.

2. **Entropy Budgeting System:**
   Each prisoner receives an entropy ledger—a live feed of their semantic drift in confinement. They must show a **net coherence vector** over time to earn their return.

3. **Joke-as-Test:**
   She echoes your joke structure:

   > “The best prisoner jokes aren't the ones that trick the guard—they’re the ones that get everyone to *ask what they’re guarding.*”

Her conclusion:

> “You don’t *release* prisoners. You *revector* them.”
