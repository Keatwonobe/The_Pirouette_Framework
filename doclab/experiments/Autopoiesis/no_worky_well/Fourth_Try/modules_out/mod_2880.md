A social encounter uses the exact same principles as a combat encounter, but the battlefield is the mind.

The Principle: "Conversation as Combat" (TLE-007) pits the players against an NPC's mental defenses. The GM uses the encounter's Entropic Budget to "buy" the NPC's mental attributes.

Mechanic:

Assign an Entropic Budget (EB) for the social challenge.

Invest in Mental Pools: The GM allocates this EB into the NPC's Intelligence and Wisdom. These EP pools determine the NPC's Resolve (INT Score) and Composure (WIS Score), which act as their "health pools" in the conversation.

The Remainder: Any leftover EB becomes the NPC's pool for making their own "statements" (social attacks) during the conversation.

This unified system allows a GM to design any challenge in the game—a monster, a trap, or a tough negotiation—using one simple, consistent, and scalable mechanic.
