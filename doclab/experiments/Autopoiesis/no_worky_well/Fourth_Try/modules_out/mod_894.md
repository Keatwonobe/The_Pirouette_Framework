Each Geodesic Template is a codified piece of wisdom, a compact instruction for navigating a specific type of temporal terrain. It is formally defined by three components:

1.  **Trigger Condition:** The specific pattern of system state and Temporal Pressure (Γ) that activates the template. It is the signature of a situation where this shortcut is valid (e.g., "when Γ is high and rising, but internal coherence Kτ is stable").

2.  **Prescribed Action:** A simple, computationally inexpensive directive. This is the heuristic itself (e.g., "shed low-priority processes," "reinforce core identity," "prioritize the action with the steepest positive coherence gradient").

3.  **Coherence Bound:** An estimate of the maximum potential coherence loss incurred by using the template. This is the known risk, the guaranteed "safety margin" that makes the shortcut viable.
