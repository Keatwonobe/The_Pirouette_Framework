This is an act of human reason and translation. It replaces the old, rigid "Fractal Menu" with a dynamic, conceptual mapping, allowing a Weaver to analyze a system by translating its components into the language of the framework.

First, the core variables are mapped using the Principle of Correspondence:

| Universal Principle   | Mapping Question                                                | Domain Examples                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coherence (Kτ)**    | What is the stable, resonant pattern of identity?               | **Physics:** A particle's quantum state. **Biology:** A viable species. **Economics:** A stable market equilibrium. **Psychology:** A coherent personality.                      |
| **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** | What is the ambient, chaotic pressure the system must resist? | **Physics:** The quantum vacuum/temperature. **Biology:** Environmental selection pressure. **Economics:** Market volatility. **Psychology:** Social and psychological stress.    |
| **Wound Channel**     | What is the medium and mechanism of memory and inertia?         | **Physics:** Spacetime geometry. **Biology:** DNA and epigenetic markers. **Economics:** Infrastructure and trade agreements. **Psychology:** Neural pathways and ingrained habits. |
| **Alchemical Union**  | What is the process of synthesis into a higher-order whole?     | **Physics:** Nuclear fusion. **Biology:** Symbiosis. **Economics:** A successful corporate merger. **Psychology:** A moment of creative insight (synthesis of ideas).        |

With this mapping, a four-step scaling protocol can be applied:

1.  **Define the System and Boundary:** Clearly state what entity you are analyzing (the "instrument") and what constitutes its environment (the "orchestra").

2.  **Map the Core Variables:** Using the table above as a guide, perform the translation. Identify the specific, measurable phenomena in your domain that correspond to the universal principles.

3.  **Locate the Geodesic:** Apply the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. Knowing the system's drive to maximize its internal coherence (Kτ) against the local environmental pressure (Γ), what is its most likely path of evolution?

4.  **Identify Resonant Handshakes:** Analyze the system's interactions with its environment. Where are the conditions for an Alchemical Union (CORE-012) being met? Where is the potential for a phase shift into a new, more complex state of being?
