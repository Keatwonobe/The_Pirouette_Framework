A thread can only fray so much before it snaps. A drifting system does not degrade indefinitely; it approaches a critical phase transition, a point of **Coherence Cascade Failure**.

This is the threshold where the system's degraded Ki pattern is no longer stable enough to resist the ambient Temporal Pressure. Its internal coherence can no longer hold itself together. At this point, the system faces one of two fates:

1.  **Reconfiguration (Basin Shift)**: It collapses into a new, different, and typically simpler Ki pattern. It "forgets" its complex identity and adopts a more primitive one. An advanced society might collapse into tribalism; a nuanced ideology might decay into rigid dogma.
2.  **Dissolution**: It fails to find any new stable resonance and dissolves completely. Its remaining information is lost as its components are scattered back into the chaotic noise of the Temporal Forge.
