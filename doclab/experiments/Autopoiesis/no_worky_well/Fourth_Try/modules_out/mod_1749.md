The first step is to divide the continuous information stream into a series of discrete temporal windows. This is the "sieve's mesh." The size of this window is a critical parameter, chosen to match the scale of the phenomena being investigated.

-   **Fixed Window:** A constant segment size is used to analyze the stream for patterns at a specific, consistent frequency.
-   **Adaptive Window:** The segment size changes dynamically, shrinking in regions of high turbulence (rapid change) and expanding in regions of laminar flow (stability) to capture events at their natural timescale.
