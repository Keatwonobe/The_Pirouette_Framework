The stability of any system is governed by its **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**, $\mathcal{L}_p = K_\tau - V_\Gamma$. **Coherence Stress** is the fundamental tension within this dynamic, forcing the Lagrangian towards zero or below and making coherence costly to maintain. It manifests in two ways:

1.  **Pressure Overload:** The external Temporal Pressure increases dramatically ($V_\Gamma \uparrow\uparrow$). The environment becomes too chaotic or demanding for the system's rhythm.
2.  **Rhythm Disruption:** The stress directly degrades the system's internal song, causing its Temporal Coherence to falter ($K_\tau \downarrow\downarrow$).

The *measure* of this stress is the gradient of the Lagrangian across the system's coherence manifold. A system is "stressed" when this manifold becomes steep and treacherous, forcing it to expend enormous energy to follow its path of maximal coherence.

-   **Low Stress**: A flat, wide "valley" in the manifold. The system is in a state of **Laminar Flow (DYNA-001)**.
-   **High Stress**: A warped, steep "ridge" in the manifold. The path of coherence is narrow and dangerous, and the system enters a state of **Turbulent Flow**.
