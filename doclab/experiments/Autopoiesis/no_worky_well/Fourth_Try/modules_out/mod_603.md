summary: Provides a unified, time-first model for systemic failure, replacing classical
  mechanics. It reframes stress, yield, and fracture as geometric consequences of
  a system's struggle to maintain coherence. Failure is defined as a phase transition
  in the Pirouette Lagrangian, where a system either scars itself by re-carving its
  Wound Channel (yielding) or decoheres catastrophically (fracture).
