In Phase I, we found stillness. We calmed the storm and allowed the waters to settle. Now, in Phase II, we do something remarkable: we begin to move again. This is the most courageous step in the journey of recovery.

This guide is for you and your helper. It outlines the gentle, steady process of turning that initial stillness into a new, healthy current. We will not force the river; we will simply show it the most natural and efficient path to follow. This is the art of transforming the first step into a steady, life-giving rhythm.
