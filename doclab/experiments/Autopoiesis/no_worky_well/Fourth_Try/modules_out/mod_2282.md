We model the lepton anomalous magnetic moment as
[
\boxed{;a_\ell = a_\ell^{\rm uni}(\alpha) ; + ; \Delta a_\ell^{(\Gamma)}(\kappa,p,m_\Gamma;m_\ell) ; + ; \delta a_\ell^{\rm rem};}
]

* **Universal piece** (a_\ell^{\rm uni}(\alpha)): a QED-like power series whose coefficients do **not** depend on (\ell) beyond mass insertions in known subgraphs. In this module we treat them as symbolic (C_n) (or as your provisional numbers when exploring).
* **Pressuron piece** (\Delta a_\ell^{(\Gamma)}): the one-loop Yukawa portal result from MATH-013v2.
* **Remainder** (\delta a_\ell^{\rm rem}): truncation, mixed higher-order (\mathcal O(\alpha g_\ell^2)), and any hadronic/EW external to Pirouette if/when included.

The combination is numerically stable, dimensionally correct, and fit-ready.
