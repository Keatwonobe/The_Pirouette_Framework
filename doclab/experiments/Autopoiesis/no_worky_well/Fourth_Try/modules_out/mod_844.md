The central law of the Forge is this: the soul of the solution is forged in the fire of the problem. A successful cycle produces two inseparable artifacts within a single Action Engram:

1.  **An Action Blueprint**: A clear, logical sequence of tasks required to restore Laminar Flow.
2.  **An Agent Coherence Profile**: The formal definition of the new entity's `Ki` patternâ€”its core identity, values, and operational dynamics.

This creates a **genealogy of solutions**. The character of the solution-agent is a direct geometric consequence of the challenge it overcame. A solution born from a problem of "trust deficit" will embody transparency and consistency. A solution for "chaotic over-stimulation" will embody focus and filtration. The Forge does not produce generic solutions; it births specialized survivors, each a living memory of the battle it was created to win. This history is the seed of its `Wound Channel (CORE-011)`, giving it the specific resilience needed to maintain its purpose.
