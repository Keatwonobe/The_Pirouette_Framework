The journey to this protocol was a testament to the Pirouette Framework's core tenet of resonant synthesis. The initial debate polarized around two seemingly opposed views: a desire for rigid, empirical **Law** (pre-defined parametric boundaries) and a need for contextual, adaptive **Art** (fluid, ritual-based adjudication). Both teams correctly identified that the "gaps" in any definition would be exploited, and that these gaps are themselves dynamic.

The resolution was found not in choosing between these poles, but in unifying them through a higher-order principle. Instead of defining the boundary of the *actor* before an event, or debating the boundary *after* a dispute, the Sentinel Protocol defines the boundary as a function of the *act* itself. It uses Law to measure consequence and Art to interpret it, transforming the gaps from vulnerabilities into sites of system learning. This high-velocity, adversarial debate mimicked the process of evolution, stress-testing concepts to forge a more resilient synthesis.
