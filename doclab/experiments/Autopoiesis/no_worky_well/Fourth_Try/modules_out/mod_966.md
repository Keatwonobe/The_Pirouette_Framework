summary: Presents the ratified, time-first model for a non-local propulsion system.
  The drive forges a temporary, hyper-coherent geometric structure ('Spindle') between
  two distant points. Thrust is generated by the controlled, asymmetrical collapse
  of this structure, causing the vessel to follow the resulting steep geodesic in
  the coherence manifold.
