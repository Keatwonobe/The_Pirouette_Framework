A creature is a simplified character sheet, built in moments using its Entropic Budget.

The Process:

Assign an Entropic Budget (EB) based on the desired difficulty.

Allocate to Health Pool: A portion of the EB is invested in the creature's Torso to become its HP. This is its raw durability. (e.g., 50% for a standard creature, 75% for a brute).

Allocate to Attack Pools: The remaining EB is invested into one or more Attack Pools. These function exactly like a player's Size Entropy (TLE-002), fueling the creature's primary attacks (e.g., "Claw," "Bite," "Fire Breath").

Determine ERR: For simplicity, a creature's Entropy Regeneration Rate can be set to 10% of its total EB per round (rounded down).

Assign Actions: The number of actions a creature can take is determined by its nature (e.g., 1 for a simple beast, 2-3 for a legendary monster).

Example: A 60 EP Ogre (Hard encounter for a party with an average TEP of ~48)

Health Pool: 30 EP invested in its Torso (30 HP).

Attack Pool: 30 EP invested in a "Greatclub" arm. It can spend up to 30 EP for a single massive 1d30 damage swing.

ERR: 6 EP per round.

Actions: 1 per turn.
