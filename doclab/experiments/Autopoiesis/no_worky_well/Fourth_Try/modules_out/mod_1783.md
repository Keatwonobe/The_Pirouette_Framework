A system does not smoothly slide from one mode to another; it leaps. This transition, a form of **Ki Morphogenesis**, is a rapid, non-linear reconfiguration of the system's entire resonant pattern.

-   **Triggers:** A phase leap is typically initiated by a perturbation sufficient to push the system off its peak and over a transition saddle. This can be caused by:
    1.  **Pressure Shift:** A significant change in the external Temporal Pressure (Î“) that lowers the current peak or raises a saddle, rendering the current mode less stable.
    2.  **Dissonant Injection:** An influx of energy or information that is incoherent with the current `Ki_m`, effectively "shoving" the system across the landscape.

-   **Resonant Catalysis:** A transition can also be induced with surgical precision. By introducing a signal that resonates with a *target* mode's `Ki_m`, it is possible to lower the Transition Cost for that specific pathway, effectively "carving a tunnel" through the manifold. This makes the desired transition the new path of least resistance.

-   **The Transition as Turbulence:** The act of moving between stable `Ki` patterns is, by definition, a period of **Turbulent Flow** (DYNA-001). The system's coherence temporarily drops as it breaks its old resonant pattern before it "locks in" to the new one, re-establishing laminar flow on a new peak.
