This map is the signature of a **complex political and moral legacy**.

* **Path of "Power" (Green):** It is pulled away from the edges and settles into the dense central region, near concepts like "**networks**" and "**mckenzie**" (likely a reference to a historian or analysis). In the world of Washington, power is not an abstract force; it's a matter of **strategic networks and structural command**.
* **Path of "Freedom" (Magenta):** This is perhaps the most telling result. "Freedom" is pulled directly and powerfully into the gravity well of "**abolitionist**" and "**transatlantic**." This document's semantic universe argues that the concept of freedom is inextricably linked to the moral and historical struggle against slavery in a transatlantic context.
* **Path of "Wisdom" (Yellow):** Wisdom's journey is long, ending in a region influenced by "**analysis**" and "**creating**." The document suggests that wisdom is not a static attribute but a generative process born from deep analysis.

**Conclusion:** The Washington document creates a universe where abstract concepts are defined by their real-world political, historical, and moral consequences.
