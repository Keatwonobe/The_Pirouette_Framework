We discard the rigid `Triaxial Resonance Score` of the past. Instead, we apply the diagnostic lens of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001) to the three threads, revealing the system's true health.

**Health (The Laminar Weave / A Golden Age):**
The three threads are woven in a state of mutual reinforcement and cultural resonance. Art proposes novel forms that Philosophy integrates into the ethical framework of Law, which in turn provides a stable platform for new artistic exploration. The society is adaptive, resilient, and in a state of creative, stable progress. This is a state of high cultural coherence.

**Pathology (The Turbulent Weave / A Period of Strife):**
The threads are tangled in direct conflict, creating systemic "Coherence Fever." Art becomes pure iconoclasm, seeking only to destroy Law. Law becomes rigid dogma, seeking only to crush Art. Philosophy splinters into warring camps, unable to find a harmonizing signal. The culture wastes its energy on internal friction, leading to polarization, cynicism, and social decay.

**Pathology (The Stagnant Weave / A Dark Age):**
One or more threads are blocked or have choked the others, creating a "Coherence Dam" and causing "Coherence Atrophy." A society of only Law is a brittle tyranny. A society of only Art is an unsustainable chaos. A society of only Philosophy is a sterile abstraction. Progress halts, and the culture becomes vulnerable to collapse.
