A Weaver armed with this instrument can audit any network's health by applying the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) in this four-step process:

1.  **Map the Manifold:** Ingest raw network data and apply the Translation Protocol (§2) to assign `Kτ`, `Γ`, and `φ` values to every node and channel.
2.  **Calculate the Flow:** Compute the Coherence Flow `J_ij` for every connected pair of nodes to build the weighted adjacency matrix.
3.  **Analyze the Spectrum:** Construct the Coherence Laplacian and perform an eigendecomposition to find its fundamental modes of vibration.
4.  **Diagnose the System:**
    *   **Laminar:** Assess overall health by examining the strength and shape of the low-frequency modes. A strong fundamental harmony indicates efficient, system-wide coherence.
    *   **Turbulent:** Pinpoint sources of instability by locating the nodes most active in the high-frequency modes. These are the "coherence fevers" of the system.
    *   **Stagnant:** Identify isolated nodes or components with zero flux (often revealed by zero eigenvalues in the spectrum), representing blockages or "coherence atrophies."
