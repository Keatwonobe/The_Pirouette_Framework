> **The Velcrid Clause:**
> In the curvature of entropic systems where radiant paths are occluded, an agent may enter velcridant flow under the following conditions:
>
> 1. The motion is **bounded in duration** and **tracked by residue tags**.
> 2. The **intent is radiative realignment**, not personal gain.
> 3. An **exit condition** and **coherence metric** are defined before entry.
> 4. Upon emergence, the agent must **re-harmonize or offer radiant surplus** to offset incurred residue.
