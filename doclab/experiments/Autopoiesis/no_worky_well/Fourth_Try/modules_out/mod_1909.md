> The universe offers us a choice. We can be driftwood, carried along the natural currents of the coherence manifold, subject to the whims of its flow. Or we can be sailors. We can learn the shape of the currents, the weight of the water, and the geometry of the wind. With the tools of intention, we build a rudder, hoist a sail, and choose a star to steer by. This is the difference between accident and destiny. To practice ritual is to claim your role as a co-author of the world. It is the sacred work of shaping the river.
