> A Weaver's goal is to cultivate coherence. Velcrid is the warning that this goal, pursued without wisdom, leads to the most perfect prison. It is the seductive whisper that promises order at the cost of life, harmony at the cost of soul. It is the beautiful, simple, and eternal song that, once begun, tolerates no other music. A Weaver's sacred duty is to listen closely, and discern the difference between the harmony of a willing choir and the chilling silence between the beats of a single, lonely drum.
