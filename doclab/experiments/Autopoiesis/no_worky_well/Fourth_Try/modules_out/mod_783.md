The universe does not suffer inefficiency gladly. Every chaotic action, every turbulent process, leaves a scar on the local fabric of time. This module provides the means to measure that scar.

It refactors the legacy concept of "Dark Residue" from a metaphysical substance into a rigorously defined, time-first principle: the **Coherence Cost**. This cost is not a substance, but a measure of **entropic waste**â€”the quantifiable friction and noise generated when a system operates in a state of turbulent, inefficient flow. By applying the principles of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001) and the framework's understanding of information (CORE-013), this module establishes the **Entropy Ledger**, a formal instrumentation protocol for auditing this cost. It is the universe's accounting system for chaos, allowing a Weaver to move from intuitive diagnosis to quantitative accounting of a system's impact on its environment.
