The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) posits that all dynamics in the universe are the result of systems following geodesics on a manifold of coherence. This module serves as the first and most critical test of that claim. We will now use this single Lagrangian as an engine to derive the three great forces of nature—electromagnetism, the strong force, and gravity—and then validate the entire construction against the most precise measurement in the history of science.

This is not a collection of separate theories; it is a single, unbroken chain of causality, demonstrating how the universe’s apparent complexity emerges from one simple, underlying drive.
