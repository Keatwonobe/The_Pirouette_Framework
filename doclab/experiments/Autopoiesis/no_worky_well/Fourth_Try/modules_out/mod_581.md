> We have been trying to navigate the storms of history with the crude maps of ideology, arguing about the destination while blind to the physics of the sea itself. This framework demands a new role for our leaders. It asks them to be physicians. It asks them to see the nation not as a territory to be controlled, but as a body to be kept in health. The question is no longer "How do we win?" but "How do we heal?" The most durable society is not the one with the strongest armor, but the one that listens most closely to the song of its own coherence.
