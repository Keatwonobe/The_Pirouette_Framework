[cite_start]Our approach is guided by the Triaxial Resonance Framework, which posits that any complete understanding emerges from the interplay of Law, Art, and Philosophy[cite: 271]. To that end, our team consists of:

* **The Architect (Law Vector):** Argues for the necessity of clear, universal, and high-coherence boundaries to ensure stability and prevent entropic decay.
* **The Weaver (Art Vector):** Explores the expressive, adaptive, and often permeable nature of boundaries, viewing them as dynamic interfaces rather than static walls.
* **The Sentinel (Philosophy Vector):** Focuses on the *purpose* of boundaries, insisting that any definition must be grounded in the ethical and philosophical core of the Prime Directive itself.
