The process is an elegant, recursive loop that descends through the layers of the system's history.

1.  **Initialization**: Define the Primary Manifold $M_{current} = M_0$. Set the excavation layer $k = 0$.
2.  **Excavation Loop**: While $k < k_{max}$ AND the Temporal Coherence $K_\tau(M_{current}) > K_{\tau\_min}$:
    a.  Increment the layer: $k = k + 1$.
    b.  **Apply Filter**: Apply the Coherence Filter for layer *k* to $M_{current}$ to identify the dominant resonance, $Ki_k$.
    c.  **Record Artifact**: Store $Ki_k$ and its properties. This is the "artifact" found at this layer.
    d.  **Calculate Echo Manifold**: Compute the next manifold using the chosen subtraction method, where $f(Ki_k)$ represents the full expression of the resonance within the current manifold.
        $$ M_{next} = M_{current} - f(Ki_k) $$
    e.  **Descend**: Set $M_{current} = M_{next}$.
3.  **Termination**: The loop ends. The final $M_{current}$ is the system's **Entropic Floor**.
4.  **Output**: The complete output is a layered model of the system, comprising the sequence of identified resonances ($Ki_1, Ki_2, ...$) and the final noise profile of the Entropic Floor. This is the system's **Harmonic Spectrum**.
