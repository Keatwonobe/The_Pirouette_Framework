This derivation is the first and most fundamental application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. It demonstrates that the drive to maximize `𝓛_p` is not an abstract tendency. When applied to the simplest possible geometry, this drive forces a specific and calculable resonant structure. The value `4π/3` emerges directly from the dialogue between the Lagrangian's universal law and the sphere's timeless form. It is a prediction, not a postulate, born from the framework's core engine.
