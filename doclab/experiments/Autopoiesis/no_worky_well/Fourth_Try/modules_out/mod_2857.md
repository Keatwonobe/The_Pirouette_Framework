This school of abilities focuses on the manipulation of kinetic force and the interaction of different entropic energies.

- Feat: Kinetic Weaving

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You gain the "Kinesis" Arcane Skill and a pool of 5 EP. This skill is the foundation for manipulating physical force.

- Feat: Telekinetic Shove (Push)

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: "Kinesis" Arcane Skill.

Effect: As an action, you can spend EP from your Kinesis pool to unleash a wave of telekinetic force. Target a creature or object within 30 feet. The target must make a contested Strength check against your EP investment. If they fail, you can push them 5 feet for every 1 EP you spent.

- Feat: Entropic Grasp (Pull)

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: "Kinesis" Arcane Skill.

Effect: As an action, you can spend EP from your Kinesis pool to create a tether of force. Target a creature or object within 30 feet. The target must make a contested Strength check against your EP investment. If they fail, you can pull them 5 feet closer to you for every 1 EP you spent.

- Feat: Synergistic Casting

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: At least two elemental Arcane Skills (e.g., Fire, Ice, Water, Earth).

Effect: You have mastered the art of elemental interaction. When two different, interacting elemental effects created by you or your allies occupy the same space or target the same creature in the same round, you can use your reaction to spend 3 EP and create a tertiary synergistic effect.

Examples: Fire + Water = Obscuring Steam Cloud; Earth + Wind = Blinding Dust Devil; Fire + Ice = Shattering Thermal Shock (makes target vulnerable to physical damage for one round).
