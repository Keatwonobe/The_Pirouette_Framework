Binding is a consequence of geometry. The path of any system is to follow the geodesic‚Äîthe path of least resistance‚Äîon the coherence manifold. A Coherence Vortex is simply a region where that geodesic is a closed loop. This condition is mathematically precise.

**The Coherence Field (`F_c`)**: This is not a classical force field, but a vector field representing the gradient of the Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`) term from the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`). It describes the "slope" of the coherence manifold at every point.
`F_c = -‚àáV_Œì`

**The Vortex Condition (`Œ©`)**: A vortex exists where the Coherence Field is rotational, meaning its curl is non-zero. The magnitude of the curl represents the intensity of the vortex's torsion.
`Œ© = ‚àá √ó F_c ‚â† 0`

In a region of high torsion (`Œ©`), a system attempting to maximize its coherence will be guided into a stable, self-reinforcing orbit. This is the geometric engine of the Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`).
