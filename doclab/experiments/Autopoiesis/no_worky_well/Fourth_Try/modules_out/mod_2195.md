The core physical assumption is that Temporal Pressure Gamma is not a static background value. It is the sum of the ambient environmental pressure (Gamma_env) and a term that depends on the system's own state.

We define the feedback law as:

Gamma(r) = Gamma_env + lambda * F(K_tau, rho, r)

Where:

lambda is a coupling constant.

F is the feedback function, which depends on the internal coherence (K_tau), the density of the resonance (rho), and, crucially, the characteristic scale or distance (r) of the system.

The potential V is a function of this dynamic Gamma: V(Gamma(r)). Our goal is to find an effective potential V_eff(r) that describes the system's dynamics.
