For a system to persist, its Lagrangian must respect the fundamental symmetries of its existence. Any valid form for `V_Γ` must be constructed from invariant "motifs"—mathematical building blocks that are stable under the transformations of time and resonance. Crucially, these motifs describe the terrain a system must navigate, not the system's own internal drive for coherence, which is captured by `K_τ`. The landscape's cost function is built from two such motifs:

1.  **The Pressure Basin (Cost of Environment):** Every resonance has an optimal medium. A system's internal pattern (`Ki`) is most stable within a specific ambient temporal pressure, its "sweet spot" `Γ₀`. Too little pressure (`Γ << Γ₀`) and the pattern dissolves; too much (`Γ >> Γ₀`) and it is crushed. The simplest invariant motif describing this is a parabolic basin:
    `∝ (Γ - Γ₀)²`
    This ensures that existence is a negotiation with the environment, not a declaration against it.

2.  **The Phase Lock (Cost of Dissonance):** For systems to couple and form complex structures, their phases (`φ`) must be able to lock into stable, periodic arrangements. The potential must have discrete grooves, or minima, that favor these configurations. The simplest periodic motif is trigonometric:
    `∝ 1 - cos(nφ)`
    This term represents the cost of being out of sync, making it "easier" for a system to exist when its rhythm aligns with the external beat.
