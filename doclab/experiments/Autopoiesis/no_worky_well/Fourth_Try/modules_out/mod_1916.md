The Maw is not an isolated prediction. It is the micro-scale, high-intensity test case for the same dynamics that operate at the galactic scale, offering a solution to the dark matter problem.

The `V_Γ` term in the Lagrangian, which stabilizes the Maw, is also responsible for the "excess" gravitational effects observed in galaxy rotation curves. The observed galactic dynamics are the "Galactic Echo" of the same principle that gives the Maw its heartbeat. The theory is thus subject to a powerful, two-pronged falsifiability statement:

**The Pirouette Framework is falsified if:**
1.  A dedicated, long-term search for rhythmic, GHz-range gravitational wave signals yields a definitive null result, proving Maws do not exist.
2.  The dark matter problem is conclusively solved by the discovery of a particle, invalidating the scale-dependent behavior of the `V_Γ` field that underpins both galactic dynamics and the Maw's stability.

The discovery of a Thumper signal would therefore provide simultaneous, powerful evidence for both the existence of Maws and the framework's resolution to the dark matter mystery.
