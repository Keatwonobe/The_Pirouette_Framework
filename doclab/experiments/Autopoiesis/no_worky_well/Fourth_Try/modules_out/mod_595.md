As established in CORE-006, any system will naturally evolve along a path that maximizes its coherence (`K_τ`) while minimizing the environmental cost of its existence (`V_Γ`). This path of least resistance is its geodesic. In the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), a system in a state of **Laminar Flow** is one that is successfully navigating this geodesic channel.

The "walls" of this channel are not physical barriers but are carved by the system's own history—its **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). These walls represent regions of the coherence manifold where deviation is energetically unfavorable. Decoherence, then, is any process that forces a system to deviate from its optimal path, whether by freezing in place, shattering its banks, or slowly losing its course.
