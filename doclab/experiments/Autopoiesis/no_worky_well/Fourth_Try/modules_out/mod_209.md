This spontaneous self-creation was not an accident; it was an imperative. The Silent Superposition represents a state where the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ) is uniformly zero—a state of perfect balance where no action is favored.

The First Pirouette was the universe discovering its first non-trivial solution to the Principle of Maximal Coherence. A dynamic, resonant pattern (a Ki), however simple, possesses a positive coherence (K_τ > 0) that outweighs the infinitesimal pressure it generates (V_Γ). Its Lagrangian value is greater than zero. The universe follows the geodesic toward states of higher coherence. It chose to *be* because being was more elegant than not being.
