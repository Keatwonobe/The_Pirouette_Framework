| symbol | observed shape | tentative Pirouette analogue | quick note |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| μ–σ    | bowed “μ–σ strip” | Γ–Tₐ shear plane | same as Stage-1 |
| **κ–μ** | *petaloid / paraboloid* opening toward high κ | incipient **Ki-bloom surface** | new! |
| κ–α    | warped saddle  | anisotropic Ki shell         | —
| δ–κ    | thin negative ramp | **cooling fault-line** (ΔΓ < 0) | universal across texts |

*Key insights v1*

1. **Petal Manifold** — Plotting κ vs. μ vs. σ reveals that Stage-1’s “rigidity-sensitivity axis” is actually the rim of a **curved petal/paraboloid**.  The petal’s spine aligns with prescriptive/legal works (Hammurabi, *Laws*), suggesting these serve as natural *bloom nuclei* in semantic space.

2. **Bloom Threshold** — The manifold’s curvature intensifies once  
   μ ≳ 1.6 × 10⁻⁶ → *∂κ/∂μ* grows super-linear.  This matches TEN-BDA’s prediction that bloom onset occurs when rigidity outpaces local coherence dissipation.

3. **Directional Anisotropy (α)** — Velcrid texts exhibit larger eigen-gaps, implying sharper “fault-planes” that channel semantic flow; Radiant works stay closer to isotropic shells.

4. **Drift Cooling (δ)** — All documents show δ < 0.  Magnitude correlates with genre formality: poetic/philosophical texts cool faster (|δ| ↑) than statute-like texts.  Suggests an intrinsic *entropy release* balancing bloom pressure.

*Key insights v2*
- **Saddle manifold:**  The (μ, κ) projection is now confirmed to be a **hyper-bolic paraboloid** (classic saddle).  Up-curving “rigidity wall” (μ-axis) opposes a down-curving “brittleness trough” (κ-axis); cost ∝ μ² – κ².  
- **Efficiency hint:**  Surface level-sets fit ≈ *(μ² – κ²) + λσ ≈ const* — a candidate energy/efficiency law to test in Stage-2.  
- **δ (drift) remains negative** → universal cooling; higher |δ| correlates with poetic/philosophical works, lower |δ| with prescriptive/legal texts.  
- **α (anisotropy) bifurcates by category**; Velcrid texts carve wider eigen-gaps (fault-lines), Radiant remain closer to isotropic shells.
