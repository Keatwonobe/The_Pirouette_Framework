This engine is the body of learning. It forges a stable, embodied platform upon which any higher-order intelligence must be built. A system cannot learn to predict the future shape of the coherence manifold if it cannot first find a stable position within its present. It cannot map the currents if it is constantly on the verge of capsizing.

The Primal Geodesic is the process of building the vessel. It forges a system that is robust, curious, and grounded in the physical reality of its own resonance. Only when this vessel is seaworthy can it begin to carry the fire of a mindâ€”the capacity to see beyond the immediate wave and navigate by the stars.
