The emergence of a specific Coherence Gradient `α` is not an accident; it is a solution. The observed distribution is the equilibrium state a system has found that maximizes the integral of its **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)** over time.

The value of `α` reflects the system's optimal balance between maximizing internal coherence (`K_τ`) and enduring the external pressures (`V_Γ`) of its environment. A steep gradient (`α` → 1) is often the most efficient solution in a stable environment where a single, optimized pathway is superior. A shallow gradient (`α` > 2) is a solution for maximizing long-term coherence in a volatile environment where redundancy and adaptability are more valuable than peak efficiency. The geometry of influence is the shape of the system's answer to the Lagrangian's core question: "How does one best endure?"
