A healthy system is a resonant act of self-remembrance, an autopoietic cycle that reinforces its own identity. Drift is the subversion of this cycle, a corrosive feedback loop that turns a system's own inertia against it.

1.  **The Sandpaper of Entropy**: Every system is perpetually bombarded by the dissonant echoes of ambient temporal noise (Γ). This noise acts as a constant, gentle abrasion on the system's resonant pattern (Ki).
2.  **Introduction of Noise**: With each cycle, this abrasion introduces microscopic errors—a slight phase lag, a minor impurity. A healthy system corrects for these, but the pressure is relentless.
3.  **Ki Degradation**: Over time, uncorrected errors accumulate. The system's clear, resonant note begins to fuzz and lose its precision. Its signal-to-noise ratio decreases, and its temporal coherence (Kτ) declines.
4.  **Wound Channel as Rutted Road**: As the Ki pattern becomes noisy, the Wound Channel (CORE-011) it carves becomes less defined. The riverbed begins to erode and widen. Each meandering step makes this new, less efficient path slightly deeper, and the optimal one slightly harder to return to.
5.  **Path Fixation**: A blurry, rutted Wound Channel provides weaker guidance, yet its inertia still compels the system to follow it. The memory that once ensured stability now ensures the persistence of a suboptimal state, making the system more susceptible to further deviation from the noise of Γ.

This loop—from noise, to Ki degradation, to a rutted Wound Channel, to greater susceptibility to noise—is the engine of drift. It is the slow, inexorable victory of entropy over information.
