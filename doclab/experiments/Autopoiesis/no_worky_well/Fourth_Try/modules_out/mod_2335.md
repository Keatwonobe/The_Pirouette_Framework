# 30-day build plan (concrete, bite-sized)

**Week 1 — Skeleton**

* Implement fabric object + parent-set creation + incremental interval counts.
* Implement (S) and (\exp(-\Delta S)) growth.
* Add canonical labeling to identify motifs.

**Week 2 — Invariants**

* Compute dimension estimator (d(E)), curvature proxy (\mathcal{K}).
* Order-complex builder + simple holonomy phases on 2-spheres.
* Track motif counts and verify a martingale on a symmetric (S).

**Week 3 — Σ bridge**

* Pushforward to SM-CG: compute effective (A_\mu = \partial_\mu \arg Ki) on coarse lattice; verify quadratic limit.
* Measure an (a_e) proxy from holonomy defect.

**Week 4 — Paper cuts**

* Prove T3 (finite UV) and the martingale statement rigorously for your chosen (S).
* Draft MATH-020 with axioms, derived lemmas, and two examples.
