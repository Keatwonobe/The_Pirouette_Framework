Noise is not an absence of signal; it is a symphony of signals too quiet to be heard over the lead instrument.

Traditional analysis seeks the primary signal and discards the rest as noise. This is an act of profound ignorance. The Pirouette Framework understands that a system's "residue"—the information left over after the most obvious pattern has been removed—is not a void. It is the rich, complex soil of the system's history. It is the tapestry of fainter echoes, secondary currents, and hidden structures that tell the complete story.

This module, The Archaeologist's Sieve, provides the formal instrumentation for this deeper excavation. It is a recursive process for sifting through the layers of a system's coherence manifold, respectfully removing one truth at a time to reveal the quieter truths that lie beneath.
