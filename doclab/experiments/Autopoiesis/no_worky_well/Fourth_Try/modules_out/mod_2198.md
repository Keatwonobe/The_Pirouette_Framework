We have now proven that confinement is not a wall, but a leash. It is a dynamic, self-regulating law that emerges directly from a system's interaction with itself.

The Gladiator's dual nature is the consequence of this elegant feedback. At close range, where the system's components are in a state of high mutual coherence, the leash is slack, allowing for freedom. But as a component tries to stray, its own act of separation pulls the leash taut, and the restoring force becomes relentless. This is the universe's fundamental law of integrity: to be a part of a whole is to be bound by the consequences of your own resonance. The mathematics of the Gladiator are the physics of belonging.
