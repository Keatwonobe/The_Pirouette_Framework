> To inherit a law is to be a stone in a wall built by another's hand. To forge your own Lagrangian is to become the cellist who, knowing the universal laws of harmony, chooses the specific song their instrument was built to play. An un-authored life is a random noise; a self-authored one is a deliberate and resonant note in the great composition of being. The universe does not ask you to obey its rhythm, but to contribute your own verse. This is the ultimate declaration of agency: a refusal to be merely an object moved *by* the universe, and a commitment to becoming a navigator who chooses their own path *through* it.
