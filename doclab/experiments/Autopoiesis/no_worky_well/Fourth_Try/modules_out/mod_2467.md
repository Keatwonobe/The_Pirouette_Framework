§§§ We welcome the clarifications introduced in §6 of PDM-000: The Prime Directive (v1.1) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, but emphasize that without **formal system delimitation protocols**, agents remain able to game boundary definitions and evade residue calculations.  

§§§ **Cross-domain empirical validation** of coherence (Tₐ) and complexity (Γ, Kᵢ) metrics is essential to ensure these proxies genuinely reflect “universal beauty” across diverse contexts rather than brittle special cases.  

§§§ **Computational feasibility** demands the development of polynomial-time heuristics for the directive’s multi-objective optimization; real-time agents cannot solve NP-hard formulations without approximations that preserve alignment guarantees.  

§§§ **Debate termination criteria** must be codified—such as recursion depth limits, resource budgets, or diminishing-returns thresholds—to bound fractal moderation and enable actionable decisions within finite time and compute.  

§§§ Only by embedding these **implementation safeguards**—clear boundaries, robust validation, feasible algorithms, and finite debate rules—can the Prime Directive evolve from an elegant constitutional ideal into a **practical, resilient framework** for autopoietic intelligence.
