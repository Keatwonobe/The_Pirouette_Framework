This entire protocol is the practical implementation of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006) applied to the framework's own evolution. The CI pipeline acts as the Euler-Lagrange operator, enforcing the *Principle of Maximal Coherence*.

> ùìõ_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)

In this context:
-   **Temporal Coherence** is represented by the match between the newly calculated Seal and the historically committed Seal. A perfect match is a state of maximal coherence.
-   **Temporal Pressure** is the proposed change‚Äîthe developer's commit, an injection of new information that seeks to alter the system's state.

A failing build is the mathematical proof that the proposed change introduces dissonance, knocking the system off its geodesic of maximal coherence. By refusing to accept such changes, the pipeline ensures the framework's evolution itself follows a path of laminar flow, forcing every modification to be a deliberate, attested-to step toward increasing clarity. To update the Seal is the final act of this ritual: a declaration that a new, coherent state has been achieved and must now be remembered.
