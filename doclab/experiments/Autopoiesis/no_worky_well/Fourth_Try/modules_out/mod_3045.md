\section*{§1 · Motivation}
In XAP-006 the Σ-pushforward of the internal fiber $\mathcal{F}$ produced non-Abelian gauge fields and a natural order parameter $\langle Ki\rangle$.  
Here we show that the same time-substrate term controlling Γ-field stiffness generates effective rest masses for these excitations.  
Mass thus arises not from an external scalar but from the **temporal elasticity** of the substrate itself.
