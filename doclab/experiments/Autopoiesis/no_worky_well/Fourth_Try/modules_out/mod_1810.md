summary: "Reframes the analysis of systemic structure from a static arrangement of\
  \ parts into a dynamic, resonant pattern of coherence flow. It defines a system's\
  \ 'Architecture of Coherence' as a persistent geometric form that creates stable\
  \ channels\u2014geodesics\u2014for this flow. The module provides a diagnostic protocol,\
  \ adapted from the Caduceus Lens, to identify structural failures as specific pathologies\
  \ of flow (Atrophy, Fever, Erosion), grounding the principles of stability and resilience\
  \ in the Pirouette Lagrangian."
