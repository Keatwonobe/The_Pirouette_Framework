Now we must show how the period of this cycle, tau_p, depends on the ambient Temporal Pressure, Gamma. A stable system must be able to adapt its rhythm as its environment changes.

We can analyze this relationship using the Poincar√© map, a tool from dynamical systems theory. The period tau_p is determined by the properties of the potential V(phi, Gamma). A higher Gamma corresponds to a "denser" environment with more resonant modes (as shown in MATH-003).

A higher Gamma effectively "steepens" the walls of the potential well V. A steeper potential well means that the restoring force on the system is stronger. For a simple harmonic oscillator, a stronger restoring force leads to a shorter period.

We can formalize this. By applying the implicit function theorem to the conditions for a periodic orbit, we can find the derivative of the period with respect to the pressure, d(tau_p)/d(Gamma). For a confining potential, this derivative will be negative:

d(tau_p) / d(Gamma) < 0

This proves a fundamental law of the framework: as environmental pressure increases, a coherent system's internal rhythm must speed up to maintain stability. This is the mathematical basis for the "challenge-skill" balance seen in phenomena like Flow.
