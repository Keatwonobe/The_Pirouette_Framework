This entire process is a direct expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

*   **Turbulent State (Resistance):** The system fights a steep gradient in the potential term (`V_Γ`). It attempts to maintain its internal coherence (`K_τ`) at a prohibitively high energetic cost, resulting in low action (`S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`) and the subjective feeling of struggle.

*   **Laminar State (Flow):** The system has found the geodesic—the path of maximal action. By attuning its rhythm, it minimizes the experienced `V_Γ`, allowing its `K_τ` to be expressed almost perfectly. The subjective feeling of "effortlessness" is the direct experience of a system that has solved its own Euler-Lagrange equation in real-time.
