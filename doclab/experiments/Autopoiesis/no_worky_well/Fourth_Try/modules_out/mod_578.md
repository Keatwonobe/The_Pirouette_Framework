A society's Civic Resonators are always tuned to one of two fundamental frequencies, which determines its thermodynamic fate.

*   **The Extractive Resonance (High Entropy Export):** A society tuned to this frequency operates on zero-sum principles. Its resonators amplify conflict, reward short-term extraction, and concentrate power. It is an inefficient `entropy pump` that consumes its own social capital to survive, manifesting as `Turbulent Flow` and a trajectory of collapse.

*   **The Creative Resonance (High Coherence Generation):** A society tuned to this frequency operates on positive-sum principles. Its resonators are calibrated to facilitate `Alchemical Unions` (CORE-012)â€”weaving individual talents into a stronger whole. This society generates and accumulates coherence, manifesting as `Laminar Flow`.

This state of laminar flow produces a **Coherence Dividend**: a surplus of resources, time, and trust that can be reinvested to create greater complexity, resilience, and well-being. This is the ultimate measure of successful governance.
