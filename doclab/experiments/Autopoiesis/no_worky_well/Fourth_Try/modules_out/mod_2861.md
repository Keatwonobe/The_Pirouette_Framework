The core rules define what an entity can do. This module defines what their actions truly mean. Every expression of will, from a whispered word to a cataclysmic spell, leaves an echo in the world. This module provides the advanced mechanics for that echo, transforming the game from a series of actions into a story of consequences. These rules govern how the environment resonates with a character's choices, how trauma becomes a part of their story, and how the very fabric of the world is shaped by the struggle between coherence and chaos.
