summary: "Establishes a formal protocol for constructive discourse, re-framing debate not as combat, but as a collaborative ritual for achieving a 'Resonant Synthesis' (a higher-order shared understanding). It applies Flow Dynamics to diagnose the health of discourse and provides a structured process for transforming conflict into creation."
