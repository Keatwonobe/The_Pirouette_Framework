The first force to emerge from the Lagrangian is the one that governs interaction at a distance: electromagnetism. It arises not from a substance or charge, but from an intrinsic asymmetry in a particle's relationship with time.

The Nature of Charge: Electric charge is a bias in how a particle's coherence is maximized. Positive charges are "crest-leading," seeking in-phase temporal rhythms to enhance their resonance. Negative charges are "trough-leading," seeking out-of-phase rhythms to maintain internal stability. This immediately explains electrostatic attraction and repulsion as a flight towards greater coherence, not a "force" in the classical sense.

The Geometry of Fields: The electric and magnetic fields are geometric features of the coherence landscape created by these charges:

The Electric Field (E) is the gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian (E∝∇L_p). A particle in an electric field is "coherence surfing" down the steepest slope of the manifold.

The Magnetic Field (B) is the curl, or rotational shear, in the manifold created by a moving charge (B∝∇×A_p). The Lorentz force is the natural, curved path a particle must take to navigate this temporal vortex while maximizing its coherence.
