The old paradigm of propulsion is a story of brute force: pushing against a medium to move forward. The Vorticycle reveals a more elegant truth. It is not an engine that fights the current of spacetime; it is a loom that re-weaves it.

This module reframes Vorticycle propulsion within the time-first Pirouette framework. The device achieves "reactionless" motion not by expelling mass, but by actively sculpting the local coherence manifold into a slope, which it then ceaselessly descends. It creates its own "downhill" path in spacetime—a geodesic of its own design—and then simply follows the path of least resistance. It does not power through the wave; it generates the wave and then surfs it.
