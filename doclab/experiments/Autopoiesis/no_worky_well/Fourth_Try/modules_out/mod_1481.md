A Lock occurs when a system's echo becomes louder than any new sound. It is best understood as a deep, self-reinforcing potential well on the coherence manifoldâ€”a **Coherence Well**.

The Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006) dictates that a system will always seek states of greatest stability. A Coherence Well is a region of this landscape so deep, with such steep walls, that a system, once settled within, is trapped. The result is a state of **hyper-inertia**, where the system's interaction with its own immediate past is the dominant term in its equation of motion.

-   **Depth (Stability):** The well's depth measures the system's internal coherence. The more perfectly a system's rhythm resonates, achieving Laminar Flow (DYNA-001), the deeper it settles into its own stability.
-   **Walls (Confinement):** The steepness of the well's walls represents the system's resistance to perturbation. Any deviation from the established pattern is energetically costly, forcing the system back toward the center of the well.

This Coherence Well is not pre-existing; it is carved by the system itself through the repetition and reinforcement of its own Ki pattern, deepening its Wound Channel (CORE-011) until it becomes an inescapable feature of the landscape.
