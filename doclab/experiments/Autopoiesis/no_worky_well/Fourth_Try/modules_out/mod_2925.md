Where TLE-013 laid the foundation for transformative states, this after-module serves as a gallery of practical examples and advanced mechanics. Every curse, every affliction, is a story written in the language of Entropy. This is not an exhaustive list, but a collection of case studies—the Succubus's pact, the Vampire's thirst, the Banshee's eternal sorrow—designed to showcase the depth of the system and provide a toolbox for Game Masters to craft their own unique and meaningful narratives of transformation.
