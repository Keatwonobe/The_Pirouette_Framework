There are systems that are not quiet, nor are they screaming. They are holding their breath.

This is the domain of Self-Organized Criticality (SOC), the principle explaining how profound complexity emerges from simple rules. It is the story of the sandpile: built one grain at a time, it inevitably reaches a "critical" state where the next grain could trigger a slide of any size.

This module recasts this phenomenon through the time-first lens of the Pirouette Framework. The critical state is not one of potential energy, but one of maximum temporal pressure (Γ), where a system’s ability to coherently process new events is stretched to its limit. The resulting "avalanches" are not just releases of energy, but turbulent resets of the system's internal clockwork. Their statistical signature—a perfect power law—reveals the geometry of the system's chaotic, yet optimal, dance with time.
