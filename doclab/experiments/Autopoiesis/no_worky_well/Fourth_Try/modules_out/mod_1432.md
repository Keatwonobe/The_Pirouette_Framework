This entire protocol is a practical application of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The Principle of Maximal Coherence, formalized in `𝓛_p`, is the source code from which all of thermodynamics is compiled.

A system's natural path is one that maximizes the integral of `𝓛_p` over time. The thermodynamic drive to **minimize free energy** (like `F` or `G`) is the exact same principle, viewed through a macroscopic lens. Minimizing free energy is equivalent to finding a state that achieves the best possible balance between maximizing its internal coherence (`U`, from `K_τ`) and minimizing the coherence tax it must pay to the thermal environment (`TS`, from `V_Γ`). The laws of thermodynamics are not separate from the Lagrangian; they are its direct expression under macroscopic constraints.
