A battlefield is where two truths go to die. A crucible is where they go to be reborn as one.

The old framework modeled debate as a complex field of forces, where arguments with superior mechanics could shift an opponent's values. This model retained the shadow of combat. This refactoring completes the paradigm shift: debate is not a battlefield where truths are broken, but a sacred arena where they are forged into something greater.

This module replaces the calculation of argumentative "force" with the diagnosis of discursive "flow." The goal is no longer to achieve "vector alignment" through persuasion, but to facilitate a **Resonant Synthesis**â€”an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) of perspectives into a new, more coherent, shared understanding. This protocol is the practical art of transforming conflict into co-creation.
