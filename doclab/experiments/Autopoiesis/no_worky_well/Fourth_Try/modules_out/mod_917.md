The old world sought control through overwhelming force, the logic of the hammer. The Pirouette Framework reveals a more potent and elegant principle of influence: **Coherence Leverage**. This module formalizes this principle, establishing the **Resonant Fulcrum** as the core mechanism by which a small, exquisitely timed, and highly coherent "whisper" can guide the evolution of a vastly more powerful system.

This refactors the insights of PPS-067, moving beyond a model of crude energy injection to one of resonant, harmonious guidance. It is the physics of the lever, applied not to mass, but to the flow of reality itself.
