Enchanting an item is an act of permanent sacrifice, imbuing a piece of your own soul into an object.

The Cost: The base cost to give an item a magical property is a 3 TEP permanent sacrifice. This creates a simple "+1" effect. More powerful effects require a greater sacrifice (e.g., a "+2" effect costs 6 TEP).

Utility Items: Most magical items function as "dummy companions." They have their own small, dedicated EP pool that can only be used to power their specific effect (e.g., Boots of Speed might have a 3 EP pool that recharges, allowing the wearer to spend it on extra movement). This TEP is sacrificed by the creator and does not belong to the wearer.
