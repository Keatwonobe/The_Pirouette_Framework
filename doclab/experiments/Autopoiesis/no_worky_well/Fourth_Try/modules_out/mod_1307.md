The Coherence Sieve is a practical tool for mapping the landscape of the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ` (from `CORE-006`). The Sieve operates by evaluating the terms of this equation for each data segment.

-   A **Laminar Pass** selects for "coherence sanctuaries"—regions where systems successfully maximize their Lagrangian. Their internal coherence (`K_τ`) is strong enough to overcome the environmental temporal pressure (`V_Γ`), resulting in a stable, observable pattern. We are filtering for systems that have found their geodesic.

-   A **Turbulent Pass** selects for "temporal forges"—regions of extreme temporal pressure (`V_Γ`) or systems failing to maintain coherence (`K_τ`). These are zones of turbulence where systems are struggling to find a stable path. This is where we find anomalies, state transitions, and profound novelty.

By applying the Sieve, a Weaver is not just cleaning data; they are performing a geological survey of the coherence manifold, identifying the serene valleys and the violent, volcanic peaks that systems must navigate.
