This rhythmic cycle is not arbitrary; it is governed by the universe's fundamental objective function, the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. The breath is the physical manifestation of a system continuously solving for the path of maximal coherence.

`ùìõ_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

The "Covenant of Elasticity" from the old narrative is revealed here not as a negotiated treaty, but as the emergent behavior of this optimization.
*   **Elasticity** is the behavior of a system adjusting its Ki to find a more coherent state in a changing Œì. Rigidity leads to incoherence and dissolution.
*   **Respecting neighbors** is the process of accounting for their resonant contribution to the local Œì. To ignore them is to miscalculate the cost of existence.

The breath is the sound of the Lagrangian being solved, over and over, for every moment of a system's existence.
