This choice of anchor would be an act of numerology were it not for the result of CORE-009. The successful prediction of the anomaly is what gives us the authority to use it as our anchor, creating a perfect, self-validating, and non-circular loop:

1.  We **posit** that `α` is an emergent property of the coherence manifold, a measure of a particle's self-interaction.
2.  The framework's dynamics then **predict** the g-2 anomaly to be `a_e = α/2π`.
3.  Experiment **measures** `a_e` with breathtaking precision, providing an empirical value for `α` that validates the prediction.
4.  We then use this experimentally confirmed value of `α` to **anchor** the theory's fundamental scale of Temporal Pressure, `Γ`.

The framework is no longer merely consistent with the measurement; it is foundationally calibrated by it.
