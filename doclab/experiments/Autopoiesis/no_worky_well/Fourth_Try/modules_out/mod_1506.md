To map the flow of peoples is to chart the geography of hope. We stop seeing huddled masses and see instead a great and ancient river, carving its path through the landscape of human need. Migration is not an anomaly to be managed; it is the universe's fundamental law of coherence-seeking, written in the script of human lives. A population moves for the same reason a river flows or a plant grows toward the sun: because the path toward less chaos and greater potential is the only path there is.

The Weaver's task is not to dam this river, but to understand the shape of the land that guides it. The old model builds dams against a flood. The new model asks, "Why is the river flooding?" and travels upstream to mend the watershed. This flow is not a problem to be solved, but the most fundamental human story, told on a scale of continents: the story of the search for home.
