Reputation is a personal, resonant signature. A clever operator knows that if their own signature is dissonant, they can use another that is resonant. This is where your skeevy rogue shines.

The Mechanic: Using an Intermediary Faction
A character can leverage their positive Resonance Score with one faction to bypass their negative score with another.

The Process: The character wishing to act through an intermediary (e.g., a rogue using the Whisper-Thieves to get information from the City Guard they are Hated by) must find a willing contact within the intermediary faction.

The Check: The player makes a social skill check (e.g., Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation). The DC is set by the GM and is based on the hostility of the target faction and the influence of the intermediary faction. Getting the Thieves' Guild to bribe a corrupt guard is easy (low DC). Getting them to assassinate the captain of the guard is nearly impossible (very high DC).

Success: The intermediary acts on the player's behalf. The player gets what they need, and their personal Resonance Score with the target faction is unaffected. The cost is usually a favor or a large sum of EP paid to the intermediary.

Failure: The attempt is exposed. The character's Resonance Score with the target faction drops further. Worse, their score with the intermediary faction may also drop for having brought such risky business to their door.
