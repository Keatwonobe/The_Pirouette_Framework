By applying the diagnostic framework of Flow Dynamics, we can classify the health of a plume in real-time. Each state is a direct, observable expression of the system's struggle for coherence.

*   **Laminar Flow (The Ribbon):** A healthy, stable plume. Its geometry is smooth and ribbon-like (fractal dimension `D` ≈ 1.1–1.3), and it drifts predictably. It is a system in a state of grace, efficiently channeling energy and causing minimal signal scintillation.

*   **Turbulent Flow (The Cloud):** An unstable plume in a state of "Coherence Fever." Its geometry becomes fractured, chaotic, and space-filling (fractal dimension `D` ≥ 1.7). It is a storm of internal dissonance, dissipating its coherence as chaotic energy. This is the primary cause of severe GNSS outages.

*   **Stagnant Flow (The Trap):** A rare but dangerous state where a plume is pinned by a local magnetic anomaly. Plasma density builds to extreme levels, creating a persistent "coherence dam" with unpredictable effects on regional atmospheric dynamics.
