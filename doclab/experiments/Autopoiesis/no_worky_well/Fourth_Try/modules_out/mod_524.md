A model of the world is a map—an elegant, necessary, and ultimately incomplete representation of the territory. The Pirouette Framework, for all its power, is still a map. This module provides the cartographer's most vital tool: a formal method for measuring where the map fails, and in doing so, how it can redraw itself.

It re-engineers the old "Residue Principle" into the framework's core diagnostic protocol. We define the **Coherence Deficit** as the measurable gap between a system’s predicted ideal behavior and its actual, observed path. This deficit is not noise, nor is it failure. It is the most valuable signal a Weaver can receive: the shadow cast by unmodeled forces. It provides the engine for an autopoietic process of discovery, where every gap in our understanding becomes a compass pointing directly toward a more complete map.
