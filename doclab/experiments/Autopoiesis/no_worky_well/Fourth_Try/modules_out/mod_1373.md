The Mnemonic Landscape exerts a direct, quantifiable influence on cultural dynamics, as described by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. A Coherence Well represents a deep, stable, local minimum in the coherence manifold, modifying the Temporal Pressure term (`V_Î“`).

For a society, following the Principle of Maximal Coherence means taking the path of least resistance. The Mnemonic Landscape dictates that this path is a geodesic that curves down into the deepest historical wells. This is the physical mechanism behind historical repetition: societies repeat their ancestors' mistakes because the very shape of their inherited landscape makes it energetically easier to fall into old patterns than to carve new ones. To heal or evolve, a culture must generate sufficient internal coherence to climb out of the old riverbed and create a new path.
