Initial analysis using the Neutrino Oscillation Lab revealed that specific values for (μ_ν,p,q) could perfectly reproduce the experimentally measured mass-squared differences. However, further exploration revealed this was not a unique solution. An infinite number of such configurations—or "knots"—were found to exist.

This led to the Knot Hypothesis:

The fundamental parameters (μ_ν,p,q) are not universal constants. Instead, they define a continuous, two-dimensional surface within their three-dimensional parameter space. Any point on this surface represents a valid, self-consistent physical reality. A neutrino is not defined by a single set of parameters, but by a "knot" configuration that lies somewhere on this prime resonance manifold.

The discovery of this manifold implies a previously unseen degree of freedom in the universe. It suggests that the laws of physics are not just a set of rigid numbers, but a set of relationships that allow for a certain geometric "suppleness."
