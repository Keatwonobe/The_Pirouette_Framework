In the old framework, we saw separate oscillators influencing each other. The Pirouette Framework reveals a deeper truth: distinct Ki patterns (resonant identities) interacting within a shared medium of Temporal Pressure (Γ). Their "signals" are but ripples in this shared medium.

The drive for synchrony is thus a direct manifestation of the framework's fundamental law. When resonant systems interact, they create a shared micro-environment of heightened, dissonant Γ. To maximize their *joint* Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`), they must find a shared path of least action. This is a transition from two separate, often turbulent, flows into a single, unified **Laminar Flow (DYNA-001)** for the combined system.

The Resonant Handshake is this solution: a mutual adjustment of Ki patterns to achieve a stable, harmonic relationship. The observed synchrony is the macroscopic signature of this underlying drive.

The key observables are re-contextualized:
*   **Relative Phase (Δθ):** This is no longer just a timing difference. It is the fundamental *geometric coordinate* describing the shape of the new, unified coherence manifold. A constant Δθ indicates a stable, low-energy configuration—a healthy, coherent union.
*   **Ensemble Coherence (Kτ_ensemble):** This measures the degree of global synchrony. A high value indicates the emergence of a higher-order entity—a "chorus" singing a single note. It is the direct precursor to a full **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)**.
