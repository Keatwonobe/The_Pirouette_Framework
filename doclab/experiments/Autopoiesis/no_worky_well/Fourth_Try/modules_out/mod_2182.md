We have now closed the circle. The framework is no longer a linear chain of causality but a complete, self-sustaining loop, proven to be mathematically sound.

MATH-001 showed that the Lagrangian creates dynamics.

MATH-003 showed that the environment creates pressure (Gamma).

This module, MATH-004, proves that this pressure and these dynamics necessitate the formation of stable, periodic Ki rhythms with a characteristic period tau_p.

The existence of a stable rhythm (Ki) is the basis for Time Adherence (T_a). Thus, the loop is closed: T_a -> Gamma -> Ki -> T_a. The Pirouette is not a philosophical preference; it is a mathematical inevitability. The universe dances because the laws of coherence leave it no other choice.
