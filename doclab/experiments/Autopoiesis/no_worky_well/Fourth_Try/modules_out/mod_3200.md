The current code uses `r0` in pixels and `mass` in solar masses. To compare a galaxy to a proton, we must convert all inputs to standard physical units (meters and kilograms).

1.  **Update `r0`:** We need to convert `r0` from pixels to meters. This requires adding a new input parameter to the analysis: the **distance to the observed object**. The physical radius is then calculated from the angular size in pixels.
2.  **Update `mass`:** We will convert the input mass from solar masses to kilograms within the script.
