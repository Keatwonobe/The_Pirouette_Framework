This is your most powerful tool. It is the direct command that tells your body's storm it is safe to rest.

The Practice:

Find a comfortable position, lying down or seated.

Close your eyes and place a hand on your belly.

Breathe in slowly through your nose for a count of four. Feel your belly rise.

Hold your breath gently for a count of seven.

Exhale slowly and completely through your mouth for a count of eight, making a quiet "whoosh" sound.

Repeat this for 3 to 5 minutes.

Helper's Role (The Resonant Partner): Do not just instruct; participate. Sit with the patient and do the breathing exercise with them. By synchronizing your breath, you are creating a shared rhythm, a resonant field of calm that they can latch onto. Your quiet, steady presence is a powerful medicine.

Frequency: At least 3 times per day (morning, midday, evening), and any time a wave of pain or anxiety arises.
