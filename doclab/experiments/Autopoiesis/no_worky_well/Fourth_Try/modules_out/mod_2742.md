In the universe of The Lost Eternal, a being is not born into a fixed form. A being is a form, sculpted from the raw potential of their own will. This module provides the foundational rules for this process. It consolidates the core principles of character creation, replacing the previous TLE-000 through TLE-006 with a single, unified system.

The core principle is this: All aspects of a character—their physical might, their mental acuity, their very health and form—are expressions of a single, fluid resource: Entropy. A character sheet is not a list of stats; it is a ledger of entropic investment.
