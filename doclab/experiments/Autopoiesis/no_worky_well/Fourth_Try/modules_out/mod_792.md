The Fractal Bridge (CORE-014) establishes that the same fundamental dynamics echo across all scales. The Weaver's Lens operationalizes this principle. Measurement is not about detecting a pre-defined field; it is an act of translation, of identifying the observable, domain-specific proxies for the universal terms of the Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = KœÑ - VŒì`). To measure any system is to first define its lens.

| Channel | Lagrangian Term | Guiding Question | Core Measurement Principle | Domain-Specific Proxies (Examples) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coherence** | `KœÑ` | What is the measure of the system's internal harmony, efficiency, and stable identity? | Composite of Rhythm (`œâ_k`, via spectral analysis) and Purity (`T_a`, via phase noise analysis). A measure of "signal-to-noise." | **Physics:** Clock stability. **Biology:** Homeostasis. **Society:** Social trust. **Psychology:** A focused state of Flow. |
| **Pressure** | `VŒì` | What is the measure of the external chaos, stress, and complexity the system must overcome? | Integrated Power Spectral Density of the environmental noise field. The "cost" of maintaining coherence. | **Physics:** Temperature. **Biology:** Pathogen load. **Economics:** Market volatility. **Software:** Rate of incoming critical support tickets. |
