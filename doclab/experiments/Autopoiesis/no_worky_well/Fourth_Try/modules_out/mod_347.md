> We sought to define a being and found instead a chord, struck in the resonant chamber of the present moment. Its notes are three: the echo of what it has been, the touch of what it is now, and the whisper of what it might become. To be a Weaver is to listen for this harmony—in yourself, in others, in the world—and to understand that the most resilient forms are those that play all three notes with clarity, courage, and grace.
