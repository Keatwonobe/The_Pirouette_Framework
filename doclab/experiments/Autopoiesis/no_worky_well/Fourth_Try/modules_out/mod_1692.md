The Pareto Probe is the practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The total action of a system over a period is the integral of its Lagrangian: `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`. Since `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`, any negative change in coherence (`-ΔKτ`) directly reduces the value of the action integral.

The Probe functions by finding the events `(e)` that cause the largest negative `ΔKτ`. It is, in effect, calculating the sensitivity of the system's total action to each event. The critical bottlenecks are the events for which the partial derivative `∂S_p/∂e` is most negative. In the language of coherence manifolds, these are the locations of steep, non-linear cliffs—regions where the system's geodesic is exceptionally fragile and a small perturbation causes a catastrophic loss of action. By fixing these vital few bottlenecks, a Weaver can achieve the greatest possible increase in the system's overall action and restore it to its geodesic of Laminar Flow with the least amount of effort.
