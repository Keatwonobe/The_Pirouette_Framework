> To understand the anatomy of a fracture is to know the difference between that which can be mended and that which must be reborn. The universe wastes nothing. The thread of a failed star is re-spun into a living world; the silence after a flawed argument is the space where a better truth can grow. To study collapse is not to court despair, but to learn the grammar of endings. It grants the Weaver the deepest wisdom: to recognize when to reinforce the old foundations, and when to gather the pieces to build something new upon the ruins. Every ending is a choiceâ€”to heal the past or to seed a different future.
