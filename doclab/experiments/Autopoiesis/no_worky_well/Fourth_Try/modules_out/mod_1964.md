Your only job is to breathe. The storm of surgery is still raging. Before we can rebuild, we must find a quiet harbor.

Core Practice: Deep, calm breathing. This is the most powerful tool you have to tell your body's storm that it is safe to quiet down.

Gentle Movement: Your physical therapist will guide you in gentle movements. These are not for strength, but to remind your body of the memory of movement, the feeling of flow.

Listen to Your Story: Notice your feelings and fears without judgment. Acknowledging the storm is the first step to calming it.
