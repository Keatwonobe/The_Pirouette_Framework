Hysteresis—the fact that the path from rest-to-motion is different from the path from motion-to-rest—is a natural and inevitable consequence of the Wound Channel's memory.

*   **The Path of Acceleration:** To move from rest, the system must overcome the deep, established static well (the Coherence Dam). The leap to the `Ki_dynamic` state therefore occurs at a higher critical velocity (`v_c↑`).
*   **The Path of Deceleration:** Once in motion, the system actively carves and reinforces a new, dynamic Wound Channel. This new channel makes it energetically favorable to *remain* in motion. The system will only "snap back" to the `Ki_static` state when its velocity drops below a lower critical threshold (`v_c↓`), at which point the attraction of the old, static well finally overcomes the momentum of the new, dynamic channel.

The difference between `v_c↑` and `v_c↓` is hysteresis. It is the ghost of the path taken, a physical memory that reshapes the landscape of future possibilities.
