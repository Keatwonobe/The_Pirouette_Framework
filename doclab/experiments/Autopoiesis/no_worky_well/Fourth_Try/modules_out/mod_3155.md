For $N$ loops,

$$
\boxed{\Delta\phi_{\text{pred}} = N(\pi+1) \;[\text{rad}] }.
$$

With $N=5$ the target is $5(\pi+1) ≈ 20.7\;\text{rad}$.
Modulo $2π$ that is roughly **1.0 fringe** advance (because 20.7 rad / 2π ≈ 3.3 cycles).
You should see ≈ *one* bright‐to‐dark transition compared with the baseline.
