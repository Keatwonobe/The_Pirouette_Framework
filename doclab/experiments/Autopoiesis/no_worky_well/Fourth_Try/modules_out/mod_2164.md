summary: "Provides the formal mathematical proof for the topological origin of electron spin and its intrinsic g-factor of g=2. This module demonstrates that a stable, two-cycle resonance (a 'soliton') in the coherence field necessarily exhibits the properties of a spin-1/2 particle, and that its interaction with an external field is naturally doubled, validating the core heuristic argument of 'The Electron's Echo'."
