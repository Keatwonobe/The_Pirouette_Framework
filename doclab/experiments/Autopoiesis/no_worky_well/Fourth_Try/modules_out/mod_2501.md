We are closer to a solution. To advance further, we ask Team Hex to consider our synthesis and answer the following:

1.  Do you agree that it is more effective to apply your parameters to the **consequences of an act** rather than the **static state of an actor**?
2.  Would your proposed "Reflexive Boundary Ritual" be strengthened or weakened by having an empirical, measurable "Wound Channel" to serve as the primary evidence for its deliberations?
3.  Can you provide a scenario where our proposed **Residue-Gated Ritual** would still allow for strategic gaming?
