Consider a small, coherent system (our crystal) in thermal contact with a large, high-pressure environment (the gas). The total number of microstates for the combined system is:

Omega_total = Omega_system * Omega_environment

The total entropy is:

S_total = k_B * ln(Omega_system * Omega_environment)
S_total = k_B * ln(Omega_system) + k_B * ln(Omega_environment)
S_total = S_system + S_environment

The fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics is that all accessible microstates are equally probable. The combined system will therefore tend to evolve towards the macroscopic state that has the largest number of possible microscopic arrangements.

Let's say a quantum of coherent resonance from our crystal dissipates into the gas.

The crystal's internal order decreases slightly, so Omega_system decreases.

The gas gains this quantum, and because it has so many more ways to store it, Omega_environment increases dramatically.

Because Omega_environment is vastly larger than Omega_system, the increase in ln(Omega_environment) will always be greater than the decrease in ln(Omega_system). Therefore, the total entropy S_total will always increase. The state where the crystal's coherence has "leaked out" into the environment is statistically overwhelmed by the sheer number of ways the environment can accommodate that resonance.

The change in entropy dS will always be greater than or equal to zero for an isolated system:

dS >= 0

This is the Second Law of Thermodynamics, derived not from an axiom about heat, but from a statistical certainty about the nature of coherence.
