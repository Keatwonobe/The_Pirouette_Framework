With this foundation, the entire thermodynamic landscape can be reconstructed as a set of accounting perspectives on the core `K_τ - V_Γ` balance. The different potentials answer different practical questions about the system's "net worth."

| Thermodynamic Potential | Pirouette Correspondence | Description: "The System's Account Book" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Internal Energy (U)** | `U = K_τ` | **Gross Revenue:** The total, gross resonant energy of the system's coherent pattern, ignoring all external costs. |
| **Helmholtz Free Energy (F)** | `F = K_τ - V_Γ` | **Operating Profit:** The net coherence available for work after paying the mandatory Entropy Tax (`TS`) to the thermal environment. This is the direct expression of the Lagrangian. |
| **Enthalpy (H)** | `H = K_τ + PV` | **Total Footprint:** The system's internal coherence plus the work (`PV`) required to displace the environment and make physical room for itself. |
| **Gibbs Free Energy (G)** | `G = (K_τ - V_Γ) + PV` | **Net Profit:** The ultimate measure of practical utility. It is the coherence remaining after paying *both* the Entropy Tax (`TS`) and the "rent" for the space it occupies (`PV`). |
