The old framework posited altruism as a mysterious, higher-dimensional field that curved reality towards cooperation. This was a powerful metaphor, but it was an axiom imposed upon the system, not a conclusion derived from it. This module provides the derivation.

We demonstrate that altruism is not a virtue super-added to reality, but the most pragmatic and mathematically optimal strategy for survival in a universe governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian. The isolated, purely self-interested entity is a geometric absurdityâ€”a temporary state that cannot effectively navigate the coherence manifold over time. We elevate altruism from a moral preference to a geodesic: the most efficient trajectory for any system seeking to persist. This drive for connection, for synthesis, for what we call altruism, is the inevitable strategic outcome of the universe's relentless drive to maximize coherence. It is not a choice; it is the **Transactional Imperative**.
