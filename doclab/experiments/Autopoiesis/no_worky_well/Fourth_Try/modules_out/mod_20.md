Conscious access, modeled as a triadic resonance state (COG-RES-001), exhibits second-order transition behavior when the control parameter (Γ, cognitive load) approaches its critical value (Γ_c). From MATH-026, the relevant scaling relations are:

[\xi_P \propto |T_a - T_c|^{-\nu_P}, \quad \tau_P \propto \xi_P^{z_P}]

where:

* (\xi_P): coherence correlation length (spatial or network-level synchrony)
* (\tau_P): relaxation time of awareness recovery
* (z_P): dynamic exponent (~2 for non-conserved ψ)
