- **Clarify Definitions:** Insist on operational protocols for \(H_p, H_t, D\).  
- **Incorporate Autonomy:** Add variance and threshold terms to objective.  
- **Iterative Trials:** Use fractal “mini-debates” on each parameter: \(\lambda\), \(\mu\), bounds, ensuring no universal coercion.  
- **Fractal Moderation:** Each cycle spawns sub-debate on a single parameter until convergence on metrics that respect both harmony and freedom.
