\section*{§5 · Fermionic Curvature Coupling}
The torsion-based coupling in CORE-006 gives
\[
\mathcal{L}_f=\bar\Psi\left(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu
     - y_\Gamma \Gamma - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^\mu\gamma^\nu
     R_{\mu\nu}^{(\tau)}\right)\Psi .
\]
The effective mass term becomes
\[
m_f = y_\Gamma\Gamma_0 + \frac{1}{4} \langle R_\tau\rangle .
\]
Hence fermion rest mass equals a linear combination of substrate stiffness and curvature—time geometry and elastic response intertwined.
