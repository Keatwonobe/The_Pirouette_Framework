This module crystallizes the findings of the PDM-001 debate series, which was convened to answer the core question: "How do we standardize system boundary definitions to prevent strategic gaming?" The debate process, an adversarial collaboration between Team AWS and Team Hex, has converged on a unified solution: **The Sentinel Protocol**. This protocol replaces static, arbitrary boundary definitions with a dynamic, learning system grounded in the philosophical principle of **Anticipatory Accountability**. It provides a robust, resilient, and standardized method for governing system scope by making any entity accountable for both its state of readiness and the full consequences of its actions. Through this debate module PPS-022 was born, a new paradigm for the framework.
