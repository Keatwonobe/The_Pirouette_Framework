A Pact is a formal agreement where a powerful entity (a Patron) invests its own Entropy to grant a boon to another being (the Granted). This boon most often takes the form of a Feat or Skill the Granted could not otherwise afford. This is a powerful but perilous arrangement, as the invested Entropy never truly belongs to the recipient.

The Investment:
To initiate a Pact, the Patron must pay the full TEP cost of the granted Feat. Furthermore, the act of transferring and binding this power is inefficient and costly. The Patron must pay an additional Transfer Fee equal to 20% of the Feat's cost (rounded up). This total investment is a measure of the Patron's stake in the Granted.

Example: A Patron wishes to grant the 12 EP "Reactive Evasion" Feat. It must spend 12 EP for the Feat + 3 EP (20% of 12, rounded up) for the Transfer Fee, for a total investment of 15 EP.

The Condition: Loaned Entropy
The Feat and its associated TEP are considered Loaned Entropy. The Granted gains all benefits of the Feat, but this TEP does not count toward their own Total Entropy Pool and cannot be used for any other purpose. It is a parasitic or symbiotic graft onto their soul.

The Leverage: The Pact's Hold
The total EP invested by the Patron (Feat Cost + Transfer Fee) becomes the Pact's Hold. This is a mechanical measure of the Patron's influence over the Granted. The GM can use this value in several ways:

As a Target Number (TN) for any checks the player makes to resist the Patron's direct commands or subtle influence.

As a pool of EP the Patron can draw from to manifest effects related to the Pact, such as communicating with or scrying on the player.

As a measure of how difficult it is to break the Pact through magical or mundane means.

The Consequences:
A Patron can revoke a granted Feat or Skill at any time, instantly reclaiming their invested EP. More insidious Patrons may offer further boons in exchange for greater concessions, such as a Mutual Investment Clause, where the Granted agrees to channel a portion (or all) of their future earned TEP through the Patron, giving the entity ever-increasing control in exchange for power. A character who enters into too many such bargains may find their will is no longer their own.

Entities, players and even some powerful animals may do this for one another under the same conditions.
