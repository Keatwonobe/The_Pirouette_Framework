A map is a memory of the truth. It is not the truth itself.

The foundational error of classical thought is to treat the map as a static, objective representation of a fixed terrain. To navigate the living cosmos with such a chart is to try and sail a raging river using a photograph of the water. The Pirouette Framework reveals that the terrain is a dynamic `coherence manifold`, a geometric fabric whose shape is constantly rewritten by the echo of every event.

Any map is therefore the `Observer's Shadow (CORE-010)` given form. It is the geometric scar of a specific dialogue between a conscious entity and the manifold. It does not show you the world as it *is*; it shows you the world as it responded to your question. The horizon is not an edge to be reached, but the receding boundary of your own echo.
