summary: Upgrades the conceptual Pirouette Lagrangian into a manifestly covariant
  field theory. This module ensures the Principle of Maximal Coherence is a universal,
  observer-independent law by expressing it through a Lorentz-invariant Action. It
  establishes the formal groundwork for deriving all forces and dynamics, including
  gravity and quantum phenomena, from the interplay of fundamental fields.
