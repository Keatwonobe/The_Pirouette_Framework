The manifestly covariant Lagrangian Density that governs the interaction of these two fields takes the standard form for interacting field theory, directly expressing the conceptual Lagrangian from `CORE-006` in the rigorous language of physics:

`𝓛 = (Kinetic Terms) - (Potential Term)`

`𝓛 = [ g^μν (∂_μ C)^* (∂_ν C) + ½ g^μν (∂_μ Γ)(∂_ν Γ) ] - V(|C|^2, Γ)`

*   **Kinetic Terms:** These terms are manifestly covariant and represent the "energy cost" of creating gradients in the fields across spacetime. The first term describes the propagation and oscillation of the Coherence field, while the second describes the dynamics of the Temporal Pressure field itself.
*   **Potential Term `V(|C|^2, Γ)`:** This crucial interaction term defines the "cost" of maintaining a certain intensity of coherence `|C|^2` within a given level of ambient temporal pressure `Γ`. The potential is sculpted such that minimizing the Action naturally leads to the formation of stable, resonant patterns that maximize the conceptual Pirouette Lagrangian.
