In 3+1D, static finite-energy scalars are ruled out by Derrick for purely quadratic kinetics. Evasion routes:

1. **Time-dependent phase (Q-balls):** (C(t,\mathbf x)=e^{i\omega t},\phi(r)).
2. **Skyrme-like stiffness:** add (\lambda(\partial_\mu\Gamma\partial^\mu\Gamma)^2) or (|\partial C|^4) suppressed by a high scale.
3. **Gauge support:** minimal coupling gives magnetic pressure.
   We use (1) as the baseline since it preserves renormalizability of the leading terms.
