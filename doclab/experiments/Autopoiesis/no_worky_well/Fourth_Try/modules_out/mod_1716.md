> We do not impose our will upon the world. We listen for its intentions. The most profound act of creation is not to build, but to find the path of least resistance and clear the way. It is to see a desired reality not as a fortress to be constructed, but as a seed that already wants to grow, and to ask only: "From what soil, and with what water, will this seed most gladly sprout?" The Alchemist's Compass does not show us how to build the river; it shows us where the rain must fall.
