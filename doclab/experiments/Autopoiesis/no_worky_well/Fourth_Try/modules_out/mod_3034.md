\section*{§1 · Objective}
To derive non-Abelian gauge structure directly from the internal geometry of the Ki field under the spatialization map Σ.  
Where XAP-005 established Lorentz covariance of the substrate, XAP-006 shows that gauge covariance follows from the same variational logic once Ki is extended over an internal fiber \(\mathcal{F}\).
