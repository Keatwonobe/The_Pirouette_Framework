"The distinction you make is an illusion. The artist and the warrior are not different. They both seek to impose a pattern on a chaotic world. One uses ink, the other uses steel. The only test that matters is the one that takes place on the ground of reality, not in the ether of ideas.

I propose the Colosseum be a **Wargame of Consequence**.

Each aspirant, or team of aspirants, is given command of a simulated system on the brink of collapseâ€”a failing state, a doomed colony, a broken ecosystem. They are given limited resources ($\Gamma$), a chaotic information environment (low $T_a$), and a single, clear objective ($\phi$): *Restore Coherence*.

The artist will deploy propaganda to raise the morale of the simulated populace. The engineer will build the tools for survival. The scientist will analyze the data. The warrior will deploy security forces to contain the chaos.

There is no subjective scoring. There is no panel of judges. The system itself is the judge. At the end of the simulation, we ask one question: Did the system achieve resonant stability, or did it collapse? Victory is the only metric. The most beautiful poem is worthless if the city starves. The most brilliant strategy is a failure if the people revolt. This is how you weigh them on one scale: the unforgiving scale of results."
