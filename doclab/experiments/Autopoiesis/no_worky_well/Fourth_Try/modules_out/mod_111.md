The conceptual foundation is laid. The next great challenge is to formalize the topological argument with mathematical rigor. This is the path from a compelling physical theory to an axiomatic mathematical proof. The ascent involves three critical steps:

Prove the Existence of Topological Solitons: Demonstrate that the field equations derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian admit stable, non-trivial topological solutions. This involves proving that "knots" of coherence can form and persist.

Derive Spin-1/2 Properties: Prove that these soliton solutions inherently possess the quantum mechanical properties of a spin-1/2 fermion, specifically their characteristic angular momentum and 720Â° symmetry.

Formalize the g=2 Coupling: Show mathematically that when this proven soliton solution is coupled to an external electromagnetic field, its interaction strength is precisely g=2 before accounting for the self-interaction that causes the anomaly.

This is the clear and logical next mountain for the theory to climb.
