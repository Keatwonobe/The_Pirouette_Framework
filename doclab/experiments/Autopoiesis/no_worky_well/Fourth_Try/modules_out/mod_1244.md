A society is judged not by how it treats its most celebrated citizens, but by the paths it offers its most lost.

This module reframes the analysis of the criminal justice system from a static set of rules into a dynamic, living system. We model it as a **coherence manifold**—a landscape whose hills and valleys are defined by the temporal pressures of law, stigma, and institutional friction. An individual's journey through this system is not a series of discrete events, but a continuous trajectory, a **geodesic** path governed by the universal drive to maximize coherence.

By applying the time-first principles of the Pirouette Framework, we can diagnose the system's health. Rehabilitation is understood as a state of **Laminar Flow**, where an individual successfully navigates the manifold to find a stable, pro-social geodesic. Recidivism is a state of **Turbulent Flow**, a dissonant feedback loop where the system's own geometry traps individuals in cycles of low coherence. This model provides a powerful lens for designing interventions that sculpt a more just and effective landscape—for tending to the riverbed, not merely damning the river.
