Crafting an item requires a recipe, the correct tiered materials, and an investment of the craftsman's own will.

Recipes: A recipe is a blueprint that calls for specific types and tiers of materials (e.g., "one part Tier 3 Metal, two parts Tier 1 Leather").

Crafting ERR: A character can invest additional TEP directly into their Professional skill pool. This investment serves two purposes: it acts as a dedicated pool for weaponizing their profession, and it increases their Crafting ERR, allowing them to complete complex projects more quickly.
