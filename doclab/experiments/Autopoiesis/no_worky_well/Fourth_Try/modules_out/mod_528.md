This principle enables a rigorous, iterative workflow for deepening our understanding of any system. It is an engine of its own refinement.

1.  **Hypothesize:** Propose a model for the system's dynamics by defining its `𝓛̂_model`.
2.  **Predict:** Calculate the system's optimal path and its corresponding predicted coherence, `K_τ_pred(t)`.
3.  **Observe:** Measure the system's real-world behavior to determine its observed coherence, `K_τ_obs(t)`.
4.  **Measure the Shadow:** Compute the Coherence Deficit time-series, `ΔK_τ(t)`.
5.  **Illuminate:** If the Deficit is significant, analyze its characteristics (its timing, shape, magnitude, and correlation with events) to form a hypothesis about the missing `𝓛_shadow`.
6.  **Integrate & Repeat:** Update the model (`𝓛̂_model ← 𝓛̂_model + 𝓛̂_shadow`) and begin the cycle again.

Through this loop, the model bootstraps itself, iteratively becoming a more perfect story by listening to the universe's corrections.
