Let us demonstrate the power of this protocol with three brief examples.

**The Forest (Ecology):** Using the Lens, a Weaver maps a forest's climax community as its coherence (Kτ) and climate variability as the pressure (Γ). The Scalpel then calculates the forest's geodesic for stable biodiversity. By analyzing historical data, it might reveal that 85% of the ecosystem's deviation from this path—its loss of coherence—was caused by a single, severe drought year, highlighting a critical vulnerability.

**The Corporation (Economics):** A company's stable business model is its Kτ, and market competition is its Γ. The Lens transcribes decades of financial data into a coherence signal. The Scalpel, analyzing this signal against the company's ideal path of profit maximization, might pinpoint that a single, ill-advised acquisition is the critical fracture responsible for the majority of subsequent market share loss.

**The Idea (Psychology):** An idea's logical consistency is its Kτ, and criticism is its Γ. The Lens maps the arguments in a public debate. The Scalpel, analyzing the flow of the discourse, could identify the precise moment—a single, potent counter-argument—that created the most cognitive dissonance (coherence loss) and subsequently led to the idea's rejection by the audience.
