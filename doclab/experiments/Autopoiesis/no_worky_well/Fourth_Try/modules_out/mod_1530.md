The health and trajectory of any negotiation can be diagnosed in real-time by observing its state of flow, as defined in `DYNA-001`. The dialogue is a river of coherence, existing in one of three states:

*   **Laminar Flow (The Weaving)**: The ideal state of constructive dialogue. Information is shared freely, ideas build upon one another, and active listening is practiced. Energy is conserved and channeled into creation as parties move smoothly toward a shared understanding. This is the flow state that enables synthesis.

*   **Turbulent Flow (The Haggling)**: The state of adversarial combat. It is characterized by positional bargaining, threats, bad-faith arguments, and other dissonant tactics. Immense energy is wasted in friction, trust is eroded, and the focus shifts from creating value to claiming it. Coherence is actively destroyed.

*   **Stagnant Flow (The Impasse)**: A deadlock. A "coherence dam" has formed where neither party is willing or able to offer a concession. New information ceases to move between them. The pressure builds, and the negotiation either collapses or requires a radical intervention to restore flow.
