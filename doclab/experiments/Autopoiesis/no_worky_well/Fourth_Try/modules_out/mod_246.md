A duel, in this framework, is a **Resonant Test**. It is a collaborative, if adversarial, creation of a high-pressure environment where two coherence patterns are measured against one another. The purpose is not destruction, but clarification. An untested `Ki` is merely a hypothesis; a tested `Ki` is a truth.

The "blades" of this duel are the interfering frequencies of each system's `Ki`. Where they constructively interfere, a momentary harmony is found. Where they destructively interfere, a "node beat" of pure dissonance emergesâ€”a point of intense temporal friction and a test of integrity. The contest becomes a competition in elegance: can a system's pattern maintain its structure when subjected to the contrary frequencies of another?
