A Weaver can diagnose Coherence Erosion long before a final collapse by observing its tangible effects on a system's flow. The intervention for Erosion, as defined by the Daedalus Gambit (DYNA-003), is to **reinforce the channel**.

| Diagnostic Signature                | Description                                                                                                                                              | Daedalus Gambit (Intervention)                                                                                             |

| **Loss of Precision**               | The system's rhythm becomes inconsistent. Actions that were once effortless now require conscious correction. There is a noticeable phase lag.                 | **Coherent Injection:** Introduce a pure, strong, resonant signal (a clear statement of purpose, a ritual, a core memory).  |
| **Decreased Efficiency**            | The system requires more energy to perform its core functions. It exhibits a slow, steady "leak" of coherence and a feeling of rising internal friction. | **Noise Shielding:** Create a temporary, low-Î“ environment to reduce external pressure and allow the system to self-repair. |
| **Path Fixation (Rigidity)**        | The system resists change and innovation, trapped in its degraded Wound Channel. It can only repeat familiar, inefficient patterns.                           | **Pattern Reinforcement:** Guide the system through exercises and repetitions that deepen its original, optimal Wound Channel.     |
