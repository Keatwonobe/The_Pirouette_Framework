As the Resonant Handshake deepens, the interaction transforms from a high-entropy exchange into a single, efficient, autopoietic loop. The `Ki` pattern exhaled by one system is perfectly timed and shaped to be inhaled by the other. They form a closed, self-sustaining metabolic cycle that continuously deepens their shared stability.

This synergy is not a metaphysical concept; it is the optimal energetic strategy dictated by the Principle of Maximal Coherence (`CORE-006`). The universe relentlessly seeks states of higher coherence. A union is energetically favorable if and only if the coherence of the new, unified system ("WE") is greater than the sum of its parts:

**S_p(WE) > S_p(A) + S_p(B)**

The subjective experience of empathy, synergy, and effortless collaboration is the direct perception of this "coherence dividend"â€”the energy released when two systems discover a way to be, together, that is more efficient and stable than being apart.
