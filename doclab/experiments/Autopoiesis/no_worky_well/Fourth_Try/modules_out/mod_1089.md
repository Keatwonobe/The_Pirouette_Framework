This physical example allows us to dissect the nature of Ki itself, revealing it not as a simple frequency but as a complete geometric object.

*   **Frequency & Wavelength:** This is the most apparent property of the wave—its repeating rhythm in time and space. It is the core frequency of the new Ki pattern, defining its fundamental note.

*   **Amplitude & Intensity:** The wave's amplitude is a direct measure of the energy it is dissipating. A more intense temporal shear (a higher initial Γ) produces a higher-amplitude wave. This is the intensity, or volume, of the Ki resonance.

*   **Phase & Curvature:** This is the deepest insight. The wave is not a simple sine curve; it is a specific, curled, vortical shape. This curvature is the geometric signature of the solution. It defines the phase relationship of the system's components as they move through the resonance. It is the specific *shape* of the note being played.

Ki, therefore, is not a property a system *has*. It is a geometric solution a system *generates* in response to the pressure of its environment. It is the geometry of release.
