A Chiral Shift is a dramatic event, but it is not without warning. A watchful Weaver can observe the pre-shift tremors that signal a system's failing coherence.

*   **Rising Γ and σ_K:** The primary drivers and first warning signs. An observable increase in external environmental stress and/or internal systemic dissonance.

*   **Decreasing Time Adherence (T_a):** The system's song begins to waver. As its current Ki becomes unstable, its rhythm becomes noisy and chaotic. Its signal-to-noise ratio plummets, the sound of a system struggling to hold itself together.

*   **Increased State Variance:** The system's behavior becomes erratic. It oscillates wildly between states as it searches for a stable pattern, unable to fully settle into its degrading rhythm. These are the last, violent shudders before the leap to a new form.
