The initial challenge was to create a unique "fingerprint" for a document. Early versions of the analyzer produced maps that were structurally similar, regardless of the input text. A key insight revealed that the analyzer was mapping the structural boilerplate of the source (e.g., link IDs in a Wikipedia article), effectively creating a "connectome" of the information's container rather than its content.

This led to two critical upgrades:

Smarter Filtering: The concept extraction process was refined to filter out non-semantic noise (numbers, common stop words), focusing the analysis on the true conceptual core of the text.

Content-Based Seeding: The layout of the conceptual space is now seeded with a hash of the input file's name. This ensures that each document generates a unique, yet perfectly reproducible, geometric arrangement of its core concepts.

The result is a static map that is a true "Seeded Static" fingerprint of the document's semantic soul. The final step was to bring this map to life.
