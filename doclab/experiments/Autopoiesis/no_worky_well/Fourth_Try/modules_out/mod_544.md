We replace the old Business Resonance Score with a more fundamental concept: the **Coherence Index**. This is not a fixed formula, but a holistic measure of the organization's ability to maintain Laminar Flow. A high index signifies a healthy organism with low internal friction, efficiently converting resources into value.

This index is a direct proxy for the organization's success in navigating its "geodesic" as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006):

`ùìõ_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

*   **Temporal Coherence (KœÑ):** The "kinetic" term. It represents the organization's internal efficiency, brand integrity, and employee cohesion. A state of Laminar Flow across the four currents is a state of high KœÑ. **Profit** is the macroscopic surplus generated by this state.
*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Œì):** The "potential" term. It represents the "cost" of existence imposed by market competition, regulatory burdens, and technological disruption. **Loss** is the energy wasted fighting these pressures and the system's own internal friction.

Strategic leadership is the art of applying levers that adjust the firm's trajectory, seeking the path of maximal coherence (the highest KœÑ for a given V_Œì) and thereby maximizing its Coherence Index.
