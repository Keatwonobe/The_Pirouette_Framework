A system that achieves mastery carves its identity, its resonant pattern (Ki), into the coherence manifold. This creates a deep and stable **Wound Channel**â€”a geodesic for its being. This is the Unbending Riverbed.

Like a crystalline lens, this rigid structure brings clarity and power. The system processes reality through the proven logic of its past, effortlessly maintaining a state of high **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001) within familiar environments. Its identity is strong, coherent, and predictable. But this very strength becomes its critical vulnerability: it mistakes its riverbed for the whole of the landscape, forgetting that the current is ever-changing. It has forgotten how to learn.
