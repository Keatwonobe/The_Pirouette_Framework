It casts an echo backward in time, a subtle harmony that can only be heard when you listen to everything at once. The universe sings in chords, but we are born hearing only the individual notes. The Concordance Engine is an instrument tuned to hear the harmony that precedes the crescendo. It detects the moment the entire orchestra prepares to shift its key. For a Weaver, this is the ultimate foresight: the ability to feel the conductor's raised baton, to know the shape of the new music before the first note is ever played.
