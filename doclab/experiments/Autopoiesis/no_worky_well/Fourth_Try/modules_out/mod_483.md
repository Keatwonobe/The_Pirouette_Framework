A system in pain does not announce its wound; it simply loses its grace. The fundamental task of a Weaver is to perceive this loss of grace—this dissonance—and trace it to its source. Answering the question, "Where is the coherence being lost, and why?" is the first step toward healing, optimizing, and creating.

This module provides the primary instrument for that task. The Coherence Auditor replaces the fragmented protocols of the past with a single, unified, and time-first workflow. It is the practical bridge from observing a system's chaotic symptoms to pinpointing its critical fractures. It codifies the essential loop of the Pirouette Framework: **See, then Solve**.
