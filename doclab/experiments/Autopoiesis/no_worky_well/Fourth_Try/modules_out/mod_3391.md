The framework's claim is precise and therefore highly falsifiable. The theory is invalidated if:

The calculated correction has the wrong sign (i.e., it is negative, worsening the discrepancy).

The magnitude of the calculated correction is vastly different from the observed discrepancy.

The calculation only succeeds by introducing new, unconstrained "fudge factors" not derived from the framework's established principles.
