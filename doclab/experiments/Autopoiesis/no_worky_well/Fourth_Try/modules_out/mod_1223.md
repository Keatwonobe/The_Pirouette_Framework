The old framework's "Bleed Vectors" are now understood as symptoms of a single cause, whose effects vary based on the intensity and information content of the resonant echo. This creates a spectrum of influence.

*   **Attention Capture:** A strong, simple echo momentarily disrupts the Target's Ki, drawing its focus. It is the ringing of a bell. In the Nomad's Grammar (CORE-002), this is often an `Inward`, `Aligned`, `Transactional` flow.
*   **Memetic Transfer:** The successful transmission of a complex, high-information Ki pattern. The Target system doesn't just hear the echo; it learns the song and can begin to sing it as well. This is the physics of an idea spreading, from a cultural trend to a technological innovation.
*   **Structural Entrainment:** A powerful and persistent echo that causes the Target system's own fundamental rhythm to phase-lock with the Source's. The two systems begin to dance to the same beat. This is the final stage before an Alchemical Union, where the bridge becomes the foundation for a new, unified structure.
