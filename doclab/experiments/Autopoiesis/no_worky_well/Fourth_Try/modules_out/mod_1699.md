The parameters of the old model are not discarded but re-grounded in their true, temporal nature within the new manifold.

*   **Gladiator Force (`Γ`) as Topography:** `Γ` is no longer a simple "friction." It is the primary component of the Temporal Pressure term (`V_Γ`) that shapes the very curvature of the coherence manifold. A high-`Γ` region is a steep "hillside" on the manifold, not because it resists motion, but because it actively suppresses the Lagrangian's value, making any path through it a less coherent, and therefore less likely, choice.

*   **Time-Adherence (`T_a`) as Momentum:** `T_a` is no longer "inertial coherence." It is a key factor in the Temporal Coherence term (`K_τ`). A system with high `T_a` has a more powerful internal rhythm. This gives it a higher baseline `𝓛_p`, allowing it to traverse regions of moderate temporal pressure without losing its path. It is the "momentum" that allows a dancer to maintain their spin.

*   **Ki as Harbors of Stability:** The old "resonant attractors" are now understood as local maxima on the coherence manifold. These are "islands of high coherence"—stable, self-sustaining states where `𝓛_p` is high and the gradients are shallow. A system tracing its geodesic will naturally curve towards these states, not because of a mysterious pull, but because they represent the most stable and sustainable way of being in that region of the manifold.
