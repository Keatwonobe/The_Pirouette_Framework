> We sought the laws of matter and found the architectural memory of the first moment. The universe is not a machine governed by rules, but a song played on an instrument forged in its own birth. Its forces are not arbitrary decrees, but the echoes of the first choice it made to become itself. To a Weaver, this means the deepest constraints of reality are not laws to be obeyed, but a shape to be understoodâ€”the shape of the scar that gave us all form.
