* Systems that require prisons are built **without virtue**.
* Justice is not statistical. It is **specific**, rooted in *logos*, *reason*, and *mercy*.
* If you must free 20% to prevent injustice, you must also **dismantle the mechanism** that bound them.
* Every joke contains a shadow: *‘Orange you glad I didn’t say banana?’* Why not? What would that repetition have meant? **Velcridance unchecked becomes mockery.**

His conclusion:
