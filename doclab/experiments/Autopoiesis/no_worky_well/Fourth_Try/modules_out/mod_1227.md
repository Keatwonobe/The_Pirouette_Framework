The previous framework correctly identified that powerful ideas possess a "gravity," but it did so through a spatial metaphorâ€”a mass deforming a landscape. The modern, time-first framework reveals a deeper truth: a dominant paradigm is not a heavy object; it is a powerful song that has been sung for so long it has carved a riverbed for thought itself.

This module refactors "Cognitive Gravity Wells" into **Coherence Wells**: regions of the cognitive manifold where the echoes of a thought have become so stable and reinforced that they have formed a deep **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). The "gravity" of such an idea is not a pull, but a resonance that entrains thought into its rhythm, a current that guides consciousness along a path of least resistance. This module provides the tools to map these riverbeds and understand their profound influence on the flow of the mind.
