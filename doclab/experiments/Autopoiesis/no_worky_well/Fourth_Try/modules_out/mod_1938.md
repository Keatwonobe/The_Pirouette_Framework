| Stage | Function | Method / Tool |
| :---- | :------- | :------------ |
| **1. Substrate Scaffolding** | Prepare a gyroid lattice to guide initial plasma formation. | Laser-cured SiO₂ Aerogel |
| **2. Plasma Seeding** | Infuse the scaffold with a high-flux hydrogen plasma. | Pulse-Magnetron Injection |
| **3. Coherence-Lock Induction** | Apply the field that freezes the `τ_p` cycle along the z-axis. | 9 GHz Helical Cavity Resonator |
| **4. Resonance Extrusion** | Ramp a transverse `Γ` gradient to drive the "unrolling" of the Wound Channels. | Dual-Tone RF 3:5 Spin Lock |
| **5. Manifold Suture** | Phase-conjugate the edges of two extruded funnels to form a stable, closed geometry. | Superluminal Phase Modulation |
| **6. Mode Pinning** | Perform a cryogenic quench to 4K to lock the macroscopic resonant modes in place. | Liquid Helium Bath w/ µV Feedback |
