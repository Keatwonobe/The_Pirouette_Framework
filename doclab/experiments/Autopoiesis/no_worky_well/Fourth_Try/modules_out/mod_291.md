This entire process is a profound expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`).

The **Coherence Gambit** is a decision to make a significant upfront energy expenditure to selectively maximize the Lagrangian of a *specific component* of the self.
-   **Resonant Reinforcement** actively boosts the kinetic term (`K_τ`), pouring the entity's own coherence into the memory.
-   **Gladiatorial Confinement** builds a shield that drastically lowers the local potential term (`V_Γ`), creating a stable, low-pressure sanctuary.

The entity accepts a short-term energetic cost to carve a new, permanent "well" in its personal coherence manifold. The resulting crystalline state is a new, higher plateau of being—a more complex and resilient identity that has rewritten its own laws to better withstand the chaos of the Temporal Forge.
