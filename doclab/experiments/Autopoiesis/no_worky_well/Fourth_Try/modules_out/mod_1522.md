While the stages are sequential, the attack itself relies on several distinct vectors, often deployed simultaneously.

*   **Entrainment (The Resonant Handshake):** Before injecting dissonance, the manipulator first mirrors the target's resonant frequency. They build rapport and mimic the target's rhythms, creating a false, temporary coherence. This "resonant handshake" lowers the target's natural defenses and opens them to influence.

*   **Dissonant Injection (The Whispered Chaos):** Once entrained, the manipulator introduces the dissonant signal. Common injection vectors include:
    *   **Γ-Spiking:** Artificially inflating the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) by creating false urgency, existential threats, or information overload. This makes it metabolically expensive for the target to maintain their stable pattern.
    *   **Coherence Gaslighting:** Systematically invalidating the target's perceptions, causing them to doubt the stability and integrity of their own resonant pattern.
    *   **Wound Channel Exploitation:** Targeting a pre-existing geometric weakness—a past trauma, a deep-seated insecurity, a cognitive bias—within the target's manifold (`CORE-011`). This provides a path of least resistance for the dissonant signal.

*   **Parasitic Channeling:** As the target repeatedly follows the false geodesic, they begin to carve a new, *parasitic Wound Channel* in their own manifold. This channel does not reflect their authentic being; it is a deeply ingrained habit of thought or behavior that perpetually makes the manipulator's desired outcome the path of least resistance, rendering the manipulation self-sustaining.
