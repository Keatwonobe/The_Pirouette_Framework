The old module's complex equations are now collapsed into a more elegant and powerful set of direct identities. We no longer need an analogy; we have an identity.

| Old Concept (Analogy) | New Concept (Identity) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Information (`I` or `J_info`) | **Coherence (`Kτ`)** | Information is not data; it is the degree of order in a system's resonance. A scientific theory, a line of code, or a compelling narrative is a coherent structure (`Ki`). Its "information content" is a measure of its internal consistency, stability, and elegance—energy bound into a useful, stable form. |
| Entropy (`S` or `S_info`) | **Temporal Pressure (`Γ`)** | Entropy is not a property of the information itself, but the chaotic, incoherent noise of its environment. It is the ambient pressure of competing signals, cognitive overload, and distraction that constantly seeks to erode all patterns. It is vacant energy, unavailable for coherent work. |
| Memory Traces (`Φ_info`) | **Wound Channels** | The persistence of an idea is a physical phenomenon. A shared belief, a cultural myth, or a scientific paradigm carves a **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) into the collective coherence manifold, creating a path of least resistance that makes the idea easier to think and transmit. |
| Information Creation | **Resonant Synthesis** | New knowledge is not created ex nihilo. It is forged in an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) of resonant synthesis. The "eureka" moment is the fusion of two or more coherent ideas into a new, higher-order pattern with greater explanatory power. |

The Second Law of Thermodynamics is thus the simple, profound observation that any note, if left unsupported, will eventually be drowned out by the roar of the universe.
