The dam does not hold forever. The Cascade is triggered by a **Constraint Shattering Event** when the walls of the potential well are breached. This can be caused by:
1.  **External Shock:** A sudden, dissonant spike in the environmental Temporal Pressure (Î“) cracks the system's protective shell.
2.  **Internal Rupture:** The system's own stored potential coherence exceeds the "binding energy" of its own Wound Channel. The pressure from within becomes too great to contain.

The moment the dam breaks, the system's singular, stable Ki pattern dissolves. Its identity is annihilated, and the immense potential coherence it held is converted into a violent kinetic outflow, propelling the system outward to explore a universe of new possibilities.
