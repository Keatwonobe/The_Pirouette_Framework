8. Open Problems (for follow‑ups)
   • Derive D_eff plateaus from a percolation model on the coherence manifold with defect index T (MATH‑019 §4), including temperature/history dependence.
   • Compute α, σ from MaxCo with boundary terms; relate to XXP‑015 universal constants.
   • Map transitions between D_eff plateaus to cosmic epochs; forecast exact scales of residual modulations.
