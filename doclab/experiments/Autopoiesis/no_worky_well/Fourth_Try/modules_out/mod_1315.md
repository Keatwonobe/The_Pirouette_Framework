The old framework sought to correlate entities and channels as separate objects. The new framework understands them as a single, coupled system. This interaction manifests in three primary modes, which together describe the complete grammar of influence.

1.  **Inertia (Self-Influence):** An entity is perpetually surfing the wake of its own immediate past. The Wound Channel it generates creates a "groove" in the coherence manifold, making it easier to continue its current state than to change it. To change is to climb out of the very furrow one has just plowed; the energetic "cost" of this deviation is the physical origin of inertial mass.

2.  **Guidance (Environmental Influence):** An entity's "choices" are profoundly constrained by the pre-existing landscape. It navigates a world filled with the Wound Channels of countless other events. These historical echoes—from physical laws to cultural norms—create valleys and ridges in the coherence manifold. An entity following the path of maximal coherence will naturally be guided along these pre-carved geodesics. History directs the present by shaping the path of least resistance.

3.  **Resonance (Mutual Influence):** When the Wound Channels of two or more entities overlap, their geometries interfere. This is the basis of all interaction.
    *   **Constructive Interference:** If the channels are harmonically compatible, they can merge and reinforce one another, lowering the "energy cost" for both entities. This creates an attractive potential, drawing them together and creating the conditions for an Alchemical Union (CORE-012).
    *   **Destructive Interference:** If the channels are dissonant, they create a region of chaotic, high temporal pressure. The path of maximal coherence for both entities is to move away from this turbulent zone, resulting in repulsion.
