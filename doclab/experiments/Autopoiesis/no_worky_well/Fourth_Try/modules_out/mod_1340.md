A Watershed Event unfolds in a three-act structure, which can be diagnosed using the principles of **Flow Dynamics** (DYNA-001).

1.  **Coherence Instability (The Approach):** As a system approaches the watershed, its established **Laminar Flow** degrades. Its resonant pattern (Ki) becomes unstable, flickering between potential new states under rising Temporal Pressure (Γ). This corresponds to the faltering of Time-Adherence (Tₐ) in the old model—the experience of a system losing its clear path forward.

2.  **Turbulent Crucible (The Cusp):** At the exact point of decision, coherence collapses. The system is thrown into a state of intense **Turbulent Flow**, a crucible where its energy is consumed by internal chaos as it "feels out" the multiple viable paths ahead. This is the critical point, a moment of maximum sensitivity where the smallest fluctuation can have an outsized impact on the outcome.

3.  **Divergent Resolution (The Aftermath):** The system resolves the turbulence by "choosing" a new path. It collapses into one of the available downstream channels, undergoing a **Ki Morphogenesis** to adopt a new, stable resonant pattern. Its flow once again becomes **Laminar**, but along a new trajectory. Coherence is restored, but the system is irrevocably changed, now following a different destiny.
