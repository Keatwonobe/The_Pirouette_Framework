summary: "Provides an instrumentation protocol for diagnosing the health of an information\
  \ ecosystem. It distinguishes organic narratives from manipulation by measuring\
  \ Resonant Gain\u2014the ratio of a narrative's systemic impact to the observable\
  \ energy of its injection. It is the framework's core tool for detecting the whispers\
  \ that start avalanches."
