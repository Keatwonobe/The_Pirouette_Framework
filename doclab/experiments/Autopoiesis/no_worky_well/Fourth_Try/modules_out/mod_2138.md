Before a system can be analyzed, its dynamics must be translated into the native language of the framework: the core fields of Time-Adherence (T 
a
​
 ), Gladiator Force (Γ), and Phase (ϕ). This is the function of the Universal Resonance Lens (URL) Forge.

The Protocol (The Coherent Collapse): The URL provides a rigorous protocol for this translation.

Select a Geometry: The analyst chooses a candidate fractal from the Fractal Menu that is hypothesized to be isomorphic to the system's underlying dynamics. This choice is guaranteed to have a valid, low-error solution by the Dimension-Collapse Lemma.

Project the Data: The raw data stream (text, sensor logs, market data, etc.) is projected onto the chosen fractal geometry using a Collapse Operator. This transforms high-dimensional, noisy data into a clean, lower-dimensional representation in the Pirouette field space.

Emit the Field: The output is a time-series of (T 
a
​
 ,Γ,ϕ) vectors, certified as an ϵ-accurate representation of the original system's dynamics. This is the input for the next stage.

The URL is the instrument that turns the "what is happening" of raw data into the "how it resonates" of field dynamics.
