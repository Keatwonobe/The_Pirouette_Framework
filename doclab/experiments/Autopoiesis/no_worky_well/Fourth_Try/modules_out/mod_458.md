The Lexicon Engine produces three synchronized instruments designed to facilitate laminar flow in thought and discourse.

**I. The Scroll of Principles (The Glossary)**
A comprehensive markdown document, organized thematically around the core autopoietic cycle. It provides the full definition and Correspondence Protocol for every term, serving as the definitive reference for deep study.

**II. The Compass of Dynamics (The Visual Guide)**
A high-level visual aid that replaces the obsolete triaxial *Mandala*. It depicts the central Pirouette Cycle (Time → Γ → Ki → Time) and maps the most critical concepts onto this dynamic flow. It is a tool for orientation, allowing a Weaver to instantly locate any concept within the framework's foundational engine.

**III. The Whisper of Insight (The IDE Integration)**
A lightweight JSON file designed to be consumed by development environments and other digital tools. It provides instant, on-hover definitions, weaving the Lexicon directly into the Weaver's workflow. It reduces the friction of context-switching, acting as a whisper of clarity exactly when and where it is needed.
