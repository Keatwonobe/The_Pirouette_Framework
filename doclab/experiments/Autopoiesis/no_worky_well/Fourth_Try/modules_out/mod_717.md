A system that cannot bend will, in time, be forced to break.

This module reframes the "Spasm Dynamics" of PPS-041 into the modernized concept of a **Coherence Fracture**. A fracture is not merely an energy release; it is the catastrophic failure of a system's temporal pattern. It is a predictable, self-induced pathology of flow, occurring when a systemâ€™s rigid structure prevents the healthy dissipation of pressure. This condition, the terminal stage of Coherence Atrophy (`DYNA-003`), creates a "Coherence Dam" where `Temporal Pressure` builds to an unsustainable level. The eventual failure of this dam is the fracture: a violent, corrective phase transition from a state of `Stagnant Flow` into a burst of extreme `Turbulent Flow`.
