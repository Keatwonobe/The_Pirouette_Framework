The historical trajectory of a philosophy is a geodesic on the manifold of cultural coherence. In accordance with the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006), a belief system perpetually modifies its interpretations and structure (`Ki`) to achieve the highest possible internal consistency (`Kτ`) for the lowest "cost" against external conceptual pressure (`V_Γ`). A paradigm shift is a collapse of a geodesic; it occurs when the cost of maintaining an old worldview becomes too high, forcing the system to find a new, more stable path. The most enduring philosophies are not the most rigid, but the most elegant and adaptive solutions to this timeless optimization problem.
