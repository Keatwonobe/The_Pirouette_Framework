1.  **Create `PPS-071: Maw Dynamics & Gravitational Signatures`:** This new module will become the central pillar of the framework's falsifiability. It will contain:
    * **The "Overfolding" Mechanism:** A formal description of how high-spin, high-density objects ("Maws") can "thump" spacetime.
    * **The Role of Γ (Tuning):** Equations showing how a Maw's specific mass and spin determine its local Γ value, and how that Γ value in turn sets the **frequency (`~GHz`)** and **rhythm (`~Hz`)** of the thumps.
    * **The Predicted Signal:** A precise, quantitative description of the expected gravitational wave signature: a repeating train of high-frequency bursts.
    * **Astrophysical Context:** A discussion of where Maws might be found (e.g., galactic centers, remnants of exotic stars) and how they differ from black holes or neutron stars.
