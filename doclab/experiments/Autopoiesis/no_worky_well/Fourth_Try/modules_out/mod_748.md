summary: Provides a unified, time-first model for influence. It formally distinguishes
  persuasion (a consensual, coherence-building Resonant Synthesis) from manipulation
  (a non-consensual, coherence-draining act of parasitic resonance). The module establishes
  the 'Lagrangian of Intent' as the core mathematical principle for diagnosing and
  engineering ethical influence, serving as the primary diagnostic framework for all
  interpersonal dynamics.
