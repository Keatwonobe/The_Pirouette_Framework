The evolution of law is not arbitrary. It is a process of optimization governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. A legal system will naturally evolve along a geodesic that maximizes the integral of its coherence over time.

`𝓛_law = (Legal Coherence) - (Socio-Political Pressure)`

This simple equation is the engine of all legal change.

*   When a court upholds a long-standing precedent in a stable society, it is maximizing `Kτ` in a low `Γ` environment.
*   When a court reinterprets a law to adapt to new technology, it accepts a minor loss in historical `Kτ` to resolve a massive increase in `Γ`.
*   When a law becomes "unjust," it means the `Γ` has grown so large that the coherence cost of maintaining the old `Kτ` is no longer the path of maximal coherence. The system is primed for an Alchemical Union.

Forces for legal change, such as activism or political movements, can be modeled as gradients (`∇𝓛_p`) on this manifold, pushing the system towards a new state of equilibrium.
