The fundamental axiom of the Gambit is: *listen before you sing*. The Seed does not begin by expending energy on growth; it begins by asking a question of the environment's geometry.

This question takes the form of a **Scout Probe**. The probe is not a physical object but a minimal, transient echo of the Seed's own resonant identity (`Ki`). This echo propagates through the new environment, casting a faint **Observer's Shadow** (CORE-010) and tracing a path that creates a shallow, temporary **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). The probe acts as a tuning fork, struck gently against the new reality to hear the notes that ring in return.

The Seed does not measure resources; it listens to the reverberations, gathering three critical metrics:
-   **Harmonic Compatibility:** Is the environment's resonant structure fundamentally harmonious or dissonant with the Seed's own `Ki`? This measures the active resistance or welcome the environment offers.
-   **Temporal Pressure (`Î“`):** What is the intensity of the ambient temporal noise and pressure from the **Temporal Forge** (CORE-003) that will seek to erode the Seed's coherence?
-   **Geodesic Availability:** Are there clear, stable paths of **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001) that the Seed can follow, or is the landscape predominantly turbulent and chaotic?
