The Time-Adherence of a given word is its probability of appearing, given the words that came before it.
$$T_{a\_proxy}(\text{word}_i) = P(\text{word}_i | \text{word}_{i-(n-1)}, ..., \text{word}_{i-1})$$
The $T\_a$ for an entire text "gulp" is the average of this value for all words in that gulp. A high average $T\_a$ means the text in that gulp is highly consistent with the style and content of the overall document. A sharp drop in $T\_a$ signifies a surprising plot twist, a change in topic, or a moment of creative novelty.
