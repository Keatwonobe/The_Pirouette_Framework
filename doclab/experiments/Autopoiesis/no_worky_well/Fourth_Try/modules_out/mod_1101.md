summary: "Re-frames Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) in the time-first language of\
  \ the Pirouette Framework. It models the critical state as a threshold of maximum\
  \ temporal pressure (\u0393), where avalanches are 'coherence cascades'\u2014turbulent\
  \ releases that restore equilibrium. The resulting power-law distribution is identified\
  \ as the temporal signature of the system's strategy for navigating a 'statistical\
  \ geodesic' on its coherence manifold, thereby maximizing its long-term coherence."
