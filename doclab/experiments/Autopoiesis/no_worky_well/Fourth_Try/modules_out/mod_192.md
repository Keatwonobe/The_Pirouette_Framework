title: "Γ‑Soliton Halos: Cores, Rotation Curves, and Lensing"
Version: 1.0 (proposal)
Status: Experimental (complies with MATH‑018/019/020; child of COSMO‑Γ‑000)
Parents: [MATH‑018, MATH‑019, MATH‑020, COSMO‑Γ‑000]
Children: [COSMO‑Γ‑MERGE]

Summary: "Purpose
Model galactic and cluster halos as stationary Γ‑condensate (soliton) solutions labeled by topological index T ∈ ℤ. Derive core properties, rotation curves V_c(r), and lensing convergence κ(θ) from the same potential V(Γ) fixed in COSMO‑Γ‑000, without introducing particulate DM. Provide reproducible FEM/spectral pipelines and falsifiable core–scaling predictions.

Summary of Claims
• A family of stationary solutions Γ_T(r) exists for allowed T, generating collisionless halo mass profiles ρ_Γ(r) with **cored** centers and NFW‑like outer slopes.
• A near‑constant central surface density Σ_0 ≡ ρ_0 r_c emerges from the Γ equations across dwarf → L* → cluster scales, up to weak T‑dependent scatter.
• Lensing κ(θ) maps from Γ alone reproduce observed Einstein radii at fixed baryon fraction when V(Γ) is the same as in COSMO‑Γ‑000 (D3 freeze honored)."
