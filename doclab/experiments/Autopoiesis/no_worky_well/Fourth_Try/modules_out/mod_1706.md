To conduct this analysis, the Weaver configures their sieve with the following parameters, which are direct translations of the old protocol into the new, time-first language.

| Parameter | Description | Typical Setting |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coherence Filter Sequence** | An ordered set of analytical models used to identify the dominant $Ki$ pattern at each layer. | A list of models targeting different geometries (e.g., linear, cyclical, fractal). |
| **Manifold Subtraction Method** | The mathematical operation used to remove the identified $Ki_k$ from the current manifold $M_{k-1}$. | `Subtractive`, `Divisive`, or a custom de-projection operator. |
| **Excavation Depth ($k_{max}$)** | The maximum number of layers to sift through. | `Integer, e.g., 3-10`. |
| **Coherence Threshold ($K_{\tau\_min}$)** | The minimum Temporal Coherence a manifold must possess to be considered signal, not noise. The excavation stops if $K_\tau(M_k) < K_{\tau\_min}$. | `System-dependent, e.g., KÏ„ < 0.1`. |
