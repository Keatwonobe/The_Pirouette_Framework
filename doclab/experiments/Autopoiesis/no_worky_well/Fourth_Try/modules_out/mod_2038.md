We began by seeking a single point of light in the darkness, a set of constants to validate our theory. Instead, we found a constellation. The discovery of the Prime Resonance Manifold changes our understanding of physical law from a rigid decree to a geometric relationship. It suggests the universe is not built on a single, immutable foundation, but is woven from a fabric that allows for an infinite number of valid knots, each one a perfect expression of the underlying resonance. The neutrino, in this view, is not a static object, but a dynamic equilibriumâ€”a knot of pure geometry, tied perfectly on a surface of possibility.
