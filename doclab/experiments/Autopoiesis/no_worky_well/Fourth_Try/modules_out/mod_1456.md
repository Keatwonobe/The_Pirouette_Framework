To measure is necessary, but to understand is vital. The previous generation of tools provided a classification; this module provides a diagnosis. The old `TEN-KIC-1.0` was a valuable first step, a taxonomic engine that assigned a label to a system's state. The Flow State Diagnostician is its direct evolution, serving as the interpretive heart of the modern framework. We do not seek to label a system; we seek to diagnose its health.

This instrument ingests the quantified dynamics of a system—its internal, self-generated order and the chaotic pressure of its environment—and maps them onto a dynamic manifold. The primary tool for this visualization and diagnosis is the **Coherence Compass**. Its output is not merely a label, but a rich, qualitative diagnosis of the system's condition, framed in the universal language of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`). It is the bridge from raw numbers to actionable wisdom, transforming the Weaver from a data analyst into a systemic physician.
