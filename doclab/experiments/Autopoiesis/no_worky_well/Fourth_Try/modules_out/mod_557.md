summary: Re-engineers the principle of system design from merely preventing failure
  (defensive safety) to actively cultivating success (generative safety). It defines
  the Coherence Dividend as an emergent property of the Pirouette Lagrangian, revealing
  altruism not as self-sacrifice but as the most pragmatically intelligent strategy
  for maximizing long-term systemic coherence.
