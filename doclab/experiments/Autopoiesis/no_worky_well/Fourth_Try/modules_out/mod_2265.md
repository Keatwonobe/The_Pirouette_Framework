* **“R is the only scalar”** — Too strong. In 4D, EH is the unique second-order choice; higher-curvature scalars exist but are suppressed.
* **Floating coupling** — Fix (8\pi G) via the Newtonian limit; do not treat it as an arbitrary calibration.
* **Missing boundary term** — Add (S_{\text{GHY}}) when varying (R).
* **Ambiguous averaging** — State scale separation and define (S_{\text{eff}}) explicitly.
* **Gauge charge of (C)** — Use (D_\mu) if charged; keep gauge invariance manifest.
