The core insight of this protocol is that history possesses a physical geometry. The Pirouette Framework provides the language to describe this structure.

-   **The Wound Channel:** As defined in CORE-011, any resonant event leaves a scar in the local coherence manifold. Collective events, amplified by the shared resonance of thousands or millions of individuals, carve exceptionally deep and durable channels. A battlefield is not just soil; it is a place where the local manifold is permanently warped by the coherence of the event it hosted.

-   **The Mnemonic Landscape:** The sum of these significant Wound Channels in a given geo-cultural region constitutes its Mnemonic Landscape. This is the effective terrain upon which all present-day social and political dynamics must navigate. This landscape has distinct features:
    -   **Coherence Wells:** Sites of collective trauma (e.g., massacres, oppressions, famines) create deep "wells"â€”regions of low coherence and high temporal pressure that act as powerful attractors, pulling present-day events into cycles of repetition and reenactment.
    -   **Coherence Plateaus:** Sites of profound cultural achievement or unity (e.g., a just revolution, a period of artistic flourishing) create stable, high-coherence "plateaus" that act as reservoirs of cultural resilience and identity.

-   **Reinforcement & Inertia:** This landscape is not static. It gains inertia through reinforcement. Myths, rituals, monuments, laws, and language are active processes that re-trace and deepen its channels with each repetition. An old grievance becomes an easy-to-follow script for a new conflict, while a foundational myth provides a ready source of strength in a crisis.
