This module presents the formal theoretical basis for a new class of compact object predicted by the Pirouette Framework: the **Maw**. Where General Relativity predicts an inevitable singularity, this framework finds a song. The Maw is a dynamic, self-sustaining state of extreme temporal resonanceâ€”a stable knot tied in the fabric of coherence itself. It does not possess a static event horizon.

Instead, its existence is broadcast through a unique gravitational signature: the "Thumper," a rhythmic train of high-frequency bursts generated by a periodic, catastrophic phase transition in the local coherence manifold, a process termed a **Coherence Quake**. The detection of this signal would not only validate the Maw's existence but would also serve as a direct measurement of the same universal dynamics that offer a compelling alternative to the dark matter hypothesis.
