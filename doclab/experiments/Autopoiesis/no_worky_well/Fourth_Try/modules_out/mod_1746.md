To understand a river, one does not simply measure its volume. One must listen to its current, distinguish the steady flow from the turbulent eddy, and map the deep, silent channels hidden beneath the surface noise.

This module provides the instrumentation for such an act of listening. It refactors the legacy "Stochastic Gulping" protocol into The Rhythmic Sieve, a time-first method for analyzing any information stream. The core insight is preserved—that examining a stream in discrete segments reveals its underlying structure—but we now reframe this process not as a crude measurement of disorder, but as a sophisticated act of separating a signal's **Coherence** from its ambient **Dissonance**. It is a stethoscope for the stream, a tool for diagnosing the very health of information itself by revealing its hidden rhythms and patterns of flow.
