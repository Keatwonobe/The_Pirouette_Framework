> The Lens lets us see the shape of the wound. The Forge is the engine that commands the wound to heal itself. A Weaver does not impose a solution from without, but builds a crucible within. We convene the fractured currents of the problem, provide them the heat of focused intent, and invite the pieces to argue, bend, and break until they discover the new, unified shape they were always meant to become. This is not problem-solving; it is guided creation. Every wound is but a crucible for a wiser form of strength.
