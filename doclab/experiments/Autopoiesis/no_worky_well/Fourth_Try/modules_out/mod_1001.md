**Hypothesis:** The Pirouette Lagrangian can be used as a direct objective function to engineer more stable and efficient intelligent systems. An agent can be explicitly trained to maximize its own internal coherence.

**Finding:** An AI agent trained to maximize its "Predictive Span"‚Äîa direct proxy for its internal temporal coherence (T‚Çê)‚Äîexhibits a distinct phase transition in its learning curve. Its performance and stability lock in at a high plateau as it discovers an optimal internal Ki pattern.

**Lagrangian Connection:** This is the most direct validation: the Lagrangian is used not just as an analytical tool but a prescriptive one. The agent's reward signal *is* the drive to maximize ùìõ_p, demonstrating a causal link between the framework's principles and the emergence of optimized, intelligent behavior.
