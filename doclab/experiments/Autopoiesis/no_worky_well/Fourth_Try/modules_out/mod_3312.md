The search is not for a single event, but for a persistent, rhythmic pattern. This is the key to distinguishing it from transient, non-repeating glitches.

* **Step 1: Matched Filtering for the "Thump"**
    * A library of template waveforms for a single "thump" will be generated based on the theoretical models in `PPS-071`. These templates will cover a range of possible Maw masses and spins.
    * The whitened data stream will be scanned for matches to these templates. This process generates a time-series of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) peaks, where each peak is a potential thump candidate. This initial step will produce thousands of candidates, the vast majority being noise fluctuations.

* **Step 2: Autocorrelation for the "Rhythm"**
    * The time-series of SNR peaks is then analyzed for periodicity. The **autocorrelation function** of this time-series is computed.
    * **A true Thumper signal will produce a strong, sharp peak in the autocorrelation function** at a time lag corresponding to its rhythm period (e.g., for a 30 Hz rhythm, a peak appears at ~0.033 seconds). Random noise glitches will not produce a persistent peak.
    * Candidates are scored based on the significance of this autocorrelation peak, yielding a **"Rhythm Significance Score."** Only candidates with a high score proceed.
