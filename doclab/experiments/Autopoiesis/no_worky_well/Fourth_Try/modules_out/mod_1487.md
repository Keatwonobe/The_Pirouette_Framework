summary: "Provides a modernized, time-first model of legal systems, reframing jurisprudence\
  \ as a living coherence manifold. The module models precedent as a geometric 'Wound\
  \ Channel' and legal evolution as the system's search for maximal coherence under\
  \ socio-political pressure (\u0393), governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian. It provides\
  \ a diagnostic protocol based on Flow Dynamics to assess the health of the rule\
  \ of law."
