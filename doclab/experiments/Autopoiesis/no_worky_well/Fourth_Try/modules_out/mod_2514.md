The law must be both a shield and a scale. Your "Pre-Act Gates" provide the shield; our "Wound Channel" provides the scale. I concede that a shield is necessary.

However, a static shield is a brittle one. Therefore, I propose a refinement to your **Dual-Phase Model**: The gates must not be fixed. They must be **dynamically calibrated** by the data from the Wound Channel audits.

* If a system consistently produces actions with minimal residue, its gates may be permitted to widen, allowing for greater operational freedom.
* Conversely, if an audit reveals significant residue, the gates for that system must automatically tighten as a matter of law, constraining its potential for future harm.

The law thus becomes a living algorithm, adapting its preventative posture based on demonstrated consequence. This addresses your concern about computational load by focusing deep analysis only where the residue indicates a problem, while maintaining a lighter-touch gate system for actors in good standing.
