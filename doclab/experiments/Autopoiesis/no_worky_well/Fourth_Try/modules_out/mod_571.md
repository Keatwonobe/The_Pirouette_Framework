Emotion is not a distraction from rational thought; it is the organism's native instrumentation for navigating the coherence manifold. Affect is the direct, physiological experience of the gradient of the Lagrangian action (`∇S_p`).

*   **Joy, Compassion, Empathy (`∇S_p > 0`):** The feeling of moving *up* the gradient. These are the subjective sensations of a successful Resonant Handshake or Alchemical Union, when our coherence is increasing as part of a larger, healthier system.
*   **Anxiety, Fear, Greed (`∇S_p < 0`):** The feeling of moving *down* the gradient. These are the sensations of decoherence, the friction of turbulence, and the gnawing emptiness of a stagnant, isolated state.

Our emotions are a compass, calibrated by evolution to constantly point toward the Altruistic Geodesic.
