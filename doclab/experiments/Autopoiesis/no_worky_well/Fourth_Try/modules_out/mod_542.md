Applying the diagnostic framework of the Caduceus Lens, any organizational ailment can be identified as one of three fundamental disruptions to Laminar Flow.

1.  **Coherence Atrophy (The Stagnant Dam):**
    *   **Description:** A blockage in a critical flow creates a "coherence desert" downstream while building dangerous pressure upstream. It is the poison of inaction.
    *   **Manifestations:** Stalled R&D projects whose innovations never reach the market; bureaucratic gridlock where decisions are endlessly deferred; supply chain bottlenecks halting production; a sales pipeline that isn't moving.

2.  **Coherence Fever (The Turbulent Storm):**
    *   **Description:** A state of systemic dissonance where the organization fights itself, wasting immense energy in chaotic, internal friction. It is the fever of meaningless motion.
    *   **Manifestations:** Constant "firefighting" and crisis management; a toxic culture of infighting and political maneuvering; high employee turnover and burnout; damaging price wars driven by internal competition.

3.  **Coherence Erosion (The Fraying Thread):**
    *   **Description:** The slow degradation of the organization's core identity and memory. The patterns that once ensured success begin to fray and dissolve. It is the quiet death of forgetting.
    *   **Manifestations:** Brand decay and loss of market resonance; a slow but steady loss of market share; the departure of key employees and the institutional knowledge they hold; aging infrastructure that is never modernized.
