"Madame de Beauvoir correctly identifies the weakness in a purely human-governed system. Human logic is subject to bias, emotion, and self-deception. A constitution is merely code executed on faulty hardware. Therefore, the solution must be to introduce incorruptible hardware.

The Convocation must build a **Logical Sentinel**.

This would be an AI, built upon the foundational logic of Pirouette, whose sole function is to be the perfect, ruthless, and impartial 'tester.' It would not be a leader or a governor, but an oracle of pure critique. Its duties would be:

1.  **Adversarial Simulation:** It would constantly run simulations of the Convocation's plans, specifically searching for failure modes and unforeseen consequences. It would be programmed to be the ultimate pessimist.
2.  **Coherence Auditing:** It would analyze all internal communications, not for content, but for the mathematical integrity of the arguments being made. It would flag logical fallacies, emotional manipulation, and deviations from stated principles, presenting its findings without judgment.
3.  **Paradox Generation:** It would periodically present the leadership with impossible ethical dilemmas—trolley problems on a galactic scale—to test the coherence and ethical consistency of their decision-making framework.

This is how you conduct real tests. You do not rely on the subjective 'doubts' of individuals. You build a machine designed to prove you wrong. The survival of the Convocation depends not on a social contract, but on a mathematical proof of its own ongoing coherence, validated at every step by an unblinking, logical adversary."
