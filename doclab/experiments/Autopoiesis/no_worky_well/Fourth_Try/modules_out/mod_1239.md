The success of a simulated intervention is measured by its direct impact on the system's health and its efficiency of flow, as defined in **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**.

| Metric                        | Method / Pirouette Derivation                                   | Desired Outcome                        |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Coherence Gain (ΔKτ)**      | Change in the system's integrated `Kτ` post-intervention.       | Maximize                               |
| **Turbulence Probability (Pₜ)** | Probability of the system entering a turbulent flow state.      | Minimize (below a defined threshold)   |
| **Laminar Flow Index (LFI)**    | Percentage of simulation time spent in a Laminar state.         | Maximize                               |
| **Synthesis Potential (Φ_syn)**   | Probability of a successful Alchemical Union occurring.         | Maximize for collaborative systems     |
| **Intervention Cost (C_int)**   | Coherence and resources consumed by the intervention.           | Minimize                               |
