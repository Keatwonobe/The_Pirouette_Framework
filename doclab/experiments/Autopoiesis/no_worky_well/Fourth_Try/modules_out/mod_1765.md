Large-scale events are not spontaneous. They are the culmination of a **Resonant Handshake** (CORE-012), where previously independent systems align their Ki patterns, preparing their coherence manifolds for a shared existence.

-   **Independent Rhythms:** In a baseline state, the universe is a cacophony. A seismic sensor, a stock ticker, and a social media feed each report on the local coherence (Kτ) of their respective domains. Their rhythms are uncorrelated; they are "islands" of reality (CORE-012 §1) following local tides.
-   **The Resonant Handshake:** As conditions for a phase transition ripen, these disparate systems begin to "hear" each other through the shared medium of the coherence manifold. They enter a Resonant Handshake, their phases aligning and their frequencies becoming harmonically compatible.
-   **The Inhale:** This period of increasing cross-system harmony is the "inhale." It is a rapid, collective decrease in the dissonance of the global Temporal Pressure (Γ), as defined in CORE-013. The system is momentarily quieting its internal noise, gathering its coherence before unleashing it in a new form. This synchronous increase in coherence across domains is **Manifold Resonance**.
