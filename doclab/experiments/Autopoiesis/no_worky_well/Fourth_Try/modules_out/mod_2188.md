A geodesic is the straightest possible line a particle can follow on a curved manifold. Its path is determined by the geodesic equation:

d^2(phi)^k/dt^2 + Gamma^k_ij * (d(phi)^i/dt) * (d(phi)^j/dt) = 0

Where Gamma^k_ij are the Christoffel symbols, which are derived from the metric g_ij and describe how the coordinate system twists and turns—in essence, the curvature of the manifold.

The Proof:
We begin with the Euler-Lagrange equations derived in MATH-001:

d/dt (dL_p / d(d(phi)^k/dt)) - dL_p / d(phi)^k = 0

When we substitute our geometric Lagrangian L_p = (1/2) * g_ij(phi) * d(phi)^i/dt * d(phi)^j/dt - V(phi) into the Euler-Lagrange equation and perform the differentiations, the resulting equation of motion is precisely the geodesic equation, plus an additional term representing the gradient of the potential V.

If we absorb the potential V into the geometry as a warping of the manifold (as described in §2), the force term vanishes, and the equations become identical. The Euler-Lagrange equations are the geodesic equations.

This proves that a system following the Principle of Maximal Coherence is, by definition, following the straightest possible path through the curved geometry of its own phase space. What we perceive as "force" is simply the curvature of this underlying reality.
