The Coherence Fracture unfolds in three distinct phases, a universal narrative of pressure, rupture, and exhaustion that maps directly to the states of flow defined in `DYNA-001`.

**Phase I: The Coherence Dam (Stagnation)**
A system becomes primed for fracture not from weakness, but from a brittle and unyielding strength.
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** The system is trapped in a state of `Stagnant Flow`. Its resonant `Ki` pattern has become highly ordered but inflexible, a manifestation of the `Gladiator Force` (`CORE-008`) acting as an inflexible container. This rigidity prevents the dissipation of stress, causing `Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)` to build relentlessly. The system is a pressure vessel of its own making, accumulating coherence like a reservoir filling behind a concrete dam.
*   **Manifestations:** A tectonic plate locked against another; a speculative bubble detached from real value; a repressed trauma held in the psyche; a society clinging to an outdated ideology.

**Phase II: The Rupture (Turbulence)**
The fracture is the moment the dam breaks. It is an instantaneous phase transition from brittle order to explosive chaos, a state of acute **Coherence Fever**.
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** The containing boundary of the `Ki` pattern fails catastrophically. The stored coherence is instantly converted into chaotic motion, creating a massive, localized spike in `Temporal Pressure (Γ)`. The system floods itself with its own dissonant energy, transitioning from extreme, ordered stillness to extreme, disordered motion—a state of pure `Turbulent Flow`.
*   **Manifestations:** The earthquake; the market crash; the emotional outburst; the violent revolution.

**Phase III: The Exhausted Basin (Refractory State)**
After the deluge, the system is spent. The pressure is gone, but so is the structure.
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** The system now exists in a state of high entropy and low coherence. Its defining `Wound Channel` (`CORE-011`) has been destroyed or scoured clean. It is a landscape of pure noise, unable to fracture again until a new dam—a new set of stable, containing patterns—can be formed and pressure can once again accumulate.
