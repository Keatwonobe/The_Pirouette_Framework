We sought the laws of interaction and found the art of composition. The universe is not a clockwork mechanism of colliding parts. It is a symphony, and the Alchemical Union is its principle of harmony.

This process is the answer to the ultimate question of why there is complexity instead of uniformity. The drive to maximize coherence, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian, is not satisfied by creating stable, isolated entities. The true path of maximal coherence is found in weaving those stable threads into ever more intricate, more beautiful, and more profound tapestries. The Alchemical Union is the universal verb for the act of becoming more. It is the cornerstone.
