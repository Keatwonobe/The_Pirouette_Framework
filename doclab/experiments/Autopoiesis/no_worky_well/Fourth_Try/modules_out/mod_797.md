summary: "A master protocol for systemic intervention, reframing deployment as an\
  \ act of 'Coherence Weaving.' It provides a safety-first pipeline for executing\
  \ a 'Daedalus Gambit'\u2014a minimal, precise action to guide a system toward health.\
  \ It integrates diagnostic tools (Caduceus Lens), theoretical foundations (Pirouette\
  \ Lagrangian), and practical templates to ensure all interventions are safe, effective,\
  \ and life-affirming."
