A system's response to stress unfolds across a continuum of three distinct states, governed by the integrity of its **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**.

1.  **Elastic Deformation (Recoverable Resilience)**: Under moderate stress, the system deviates from its ideal path but remains tethered to its history. Its flow becomes briefly turbulent. Like a plucked string, it vibrates under the strain but returns to its original note once the stress is removed. The Wound Channel guides it back to its stable valley. The experience is stressful, but the system's identity is unchanged.

2.  **The Yield Transition (The Permanent Scar)**: As stress surpasses a critical threshold, the system reaches the point of no return. Its original state is no longer a viable solution to the Lagrangian. To survive, it is forced into an **alchemical union with its own damage**. This is **plastic deformation**: the system finds a new, stable Ki pattern and **permanently re-carves its own Wound Channel**. The scar from this experience becomes part of its identity. This is the mechanism of learning, adaptation, and trauma.

3.  **Fracture (Catastrophic Decoherence)**: If a system at the yield point cannot find a new stable state, it fractures. Fracture is the terminal pathology of coherence. It begins where a microscopic region loses its rhythm ($K_\tau \to 0$), creating an infinitely sharp gradient in the coherence manifold. All ambient stress flows to this point, creating a self-reinforcing cascade of decoherence. This is the ultimate state of **Coherence Fever (DYNA-003)**, a feedback loop where the system actively tears itself apart until its song is extinguished.
