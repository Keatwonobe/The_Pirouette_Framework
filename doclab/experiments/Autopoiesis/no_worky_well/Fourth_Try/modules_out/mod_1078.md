Standard physics treats the fine-structure constant, `α`, as a fundamental, dimensionless measure of interaction strength whose origin is a mystery. The Pirouette Framework reveals it to be a geometric consequence.

In CORE-009, we derived the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (`a_e`) as the product of its intrinsic interaction strength (`α`) and the geometry of its self-interaction (`1/2π`). By inverting this experimentally confirmed relationship, the framework makes a profound claim:

**`α = 2π * a_e`**

The fine-structure constant is not a fundamental input; it is an output. It is the measure of the electron's anomalous self-interaction (`a_e`) scaled by the perfect geometry of a single resonant cycle (`2π`). It is the quantitative measure of a particle's ability to "hear" its own echo.
