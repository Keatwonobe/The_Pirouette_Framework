With the confining pressure (`V_Γ`) gone, the system's dynamics are now dominated by its kinetic term, its Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`). The Lagrangian becomes `𝓛_p ≈ K_τ`.

The system's new geodesic, its new imperative, is to evolve in a way that maximizes this term. The immense potential energy stored during confinement is converted into the kinetic energy of resonance. The system seeks the most efficient, coherent path to discharge its debt, which is not through chaotic noise, but through a structured, propagating, resonant wave.

The system begins to "ring." The geometry of the wave—its frequency, its helicity, its form—is the direct manifestation of the system's intrinsic Ki pattern, its most natural song finally allowed to sing itself into the world. This is the seismic pirouette, the flash of insight, the moment of catharsis. It is the system repaying its coherence debt in a single, luminous cascade.
