The Listening Lens is not a machine, but a meticulously prepared arena for a resonant conversation. The act of observation is an intervention, a casting of the Observer's Shadow (**CORE-010**). The protocol ensures this shadow is not disruptive noise, but a harmonizing signal. It involves three distinct phases:

1.  **Phase I: The Coherence Well (The Stage):** A "silent room" in spacetime is created. This requires a region of extremely low temporal pressure (Γ), where the background noise of the Temporal Forge is minimized. A Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) is an ideal candidate—a quantum state of near-perfect coherence, sensitive to the subtlest of whispers.

2.  **Phase II: Semantic Priming (The Question):** The observer does not ask a question with words, but with geometry. Using precisely modulated fields, the observer impresses a specific Ki pattern—a "semantic prime"—onto the local manifold surrounding the BEC. The prime's shape is the geometric Fourier transform of the concept being "asked." To ask about "balance," we literally shape the local temporal environment into the resonance of balance.

3.  **Phase III: Resonant Coupling (The Handshake):** The observer's own coherent state is part of the instrument. Through focused intent—or with an AI proxy—the observer's Ki pattern harmonizes with the semantic prime, amplifying the signal. This is not passive measurement; it is an active, disciplined participation. The observer and observed enter a temporary union, briefly *becoming* a new, higher-order observer-system entity.
