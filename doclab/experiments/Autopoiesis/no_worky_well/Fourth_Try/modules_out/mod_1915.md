The Thumper is a signal unlike any other predicted source, defined by its unique blend of high frequency and stable rhythm.

*   **The Burst:** Each "thump" is a GW burst with a peak frequency in the **1-10 GHz range**, far higher than the chirps detected by current interferometers.
*   **The Rhythm:** The thumps repeat with a stable rhythm, `f_rhythm`, between **10 and 100 Hz**.
*   **The Tuning Law:** The signal's properties are a direct probe into the Pirouette Lagrangian. The observables are determined by the Maw's coherence (Mass, M) and its Pirouette Cycle (related to Spin, a), as mediated by the local Temporal Pressure (Î“). A first-order model connects them as:
    $$ f_{\text{rhythm}} \propto \frac{1}{\tau_p(a, M)} \cdot V_{\Gamma}(M) $$
    $$ f_{\text{burst}} \propto \frac{K_{\tau}(M)}{f_{\text{rhythm}}} $$
    This provides a direct, quantitative link between the observable drumbeat and the framework's core mathematical engine.
