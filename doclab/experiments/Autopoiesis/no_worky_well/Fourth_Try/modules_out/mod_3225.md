1. **Replace** the one-sentence “$T_a$ red-shifts like Ki” note in PPS-002 §4 with Eqs. B1–B4 and the invariance argument.
2. **Figure T-2**: plot $T_a^{\rm lab}(\Delta t)$ for γ = 1, 5, 20 to visualise time-dilation of coherence.
3. **Boxed lemma**: “$T_a$ is a Lorentz scalar; its derivative transforms as $1/\gamma$.”
