The dynamics of this system are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), which provides the mathematical soul of this model. For an individual within the system, their path is the one that maximizes their coherence over time.

**𝓛_p = Kτ - VΓ**

*   **Temporal Coherence (Kτ):** This term represents the "kinetic energy" toward a stable life. It is the measure of an individual's internal resources: their resilience, self-worth, skills, emotional regulation, and the strength of their pro-social identity. A successful rehabilitation program is one that actively increases an individual's Kτ.

*   **Temporal Pressure (VΓ):** This term represents the "potential energy" cost imposed by the system's landscape. It is the sum of punitive laws, social stigma, economic barriers, systemic bias, and the chaotic stress of incarceration. A purely punitive system is one that maximizes VΓ, creating a high-cost environment where maintaining coherence is nearly impossible.

A truly **rehabilitative** system works on both sides of the equation. It seeks to **increase an individual's Kτ** while actively **decreasing the VΓ** of the pro-social path. It makes the geodesic of rehabilitation the path of least resistance.
