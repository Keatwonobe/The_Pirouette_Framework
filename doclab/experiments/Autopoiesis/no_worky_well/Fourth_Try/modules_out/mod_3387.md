The electron's echo gave our framework its first empirical anchor. The muon—the electron's heavier, unstable sibling—offers something more profound: a chance to solve a mystery. The muon's anomalous magnetic moment (a 
μ
​
 ) exhibits a persistent, statistically significant deviation from the Standard Model's predictions. This is not a problem for the Pirouette Framework; it is a profound opportunity.

This protocol outlines the theoretical calculation of a_μ from our first principles. We posit that the anomaly is not a sign of exotic new particles, but the direct, measurable consequence of the muon's greater mass causing it to couple more strongly to the ever-present quantum fluctuations of the background Temporal Pressure (Γ) field. This calculation is the framework's first major predictive test against a frontier of particle physics.
