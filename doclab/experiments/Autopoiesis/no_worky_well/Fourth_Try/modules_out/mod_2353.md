Mechanism B — Clockwork/Alignment in a Multi‑Γ Chain (Two Eigenstates from One Sector)
Hypothesis
B1. Γ is a *sector* of N coupled scalars with nearest‑neighbor couplings producing exponentially hierarchical eigenmasses (clockwork/alignment).
B2. Heavy eigenstate Γ_H couples to leptons (g−2 portal) with O(1) mixing; light eigenstate Γ_L is exponentially light and weakly coupled, sourcing cosmology.

Math sketch
• L = Σ_i ½(∂ϕ_i)^2 − ½ m^2(ϕ_i − q ϕ_{i+1})^2 − V_tail(ϕ_N)
• Diagonalize M^2 → eigenvalues {m_H ≈ m, …, m_L ≈ m/q^{N}}; eigenvectors fix couplings.
• Choose q,N from symmetry (discrete shift), not from data (MATH‑018 D2/D3).

Predictions / tests
• Specific pattern of couplings: g_e : g_μ : g_τ differ for Γ_H vs Γ_L; loop‑level portal interferences appear in precision EW fits.
• Fifth‑force/EP tests: Γ_L coupling to baryons suppressed by q^{−N} → natural evasion with a calculable residual.
• Cosmology: Γ_L behaves as ultralight DM/DE hybrid per COSMO‑Γ‑CMB; CMB phase shifts constrain (q,N) space.
