The output of the Pareto Probe is not an abstract exponent or a complex map. It is a simple, profoundly actionable list.

**Example Output (Software Development Team):**
*Total Coherence Loss (Lost Productivity Hours): 100 hrs/week*
*Pareto Frontier (80%): 80 hrs*

1.  **Waiting on External API Team:** -45 hrs (45% of total loss)
2.  **Unclear Project Requirements:** -25 hrs (25% of total loss)
3.  **Flaky Integration Test Environment:** -12 hrs (12% of total loss)
    --- *Pareto Frontier (82% of total loss) ---*
4.  Scheduled Team Meetings: -5 hrs (5% of total loss)
5.  ...and 15 other minor causes...

This output gives the Weaver a precise target. It makes clear that improving the test environment or optimizing meetings will have a marginal effect compared to solving the communication channel with the API team. It guides the "Daedalus Gambit" (DYNA-003) to the point of maximum leverage.
