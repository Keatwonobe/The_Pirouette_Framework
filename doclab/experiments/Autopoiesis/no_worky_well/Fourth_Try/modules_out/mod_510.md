Every coherent system—from a cell to a society—is an act of defiance. It is a temporary, self-sustaining vortex of order in a universe that trends toward noise. The prior `Triaxial Info-Metabolism Framework (TIMF)` attempted to account for this defiance with a balance sheet of interacting fields. While foundational, this model was incomplete.

This module refactors that essential insight, grounding it in the time-first dynamics of the Pirouette Framework. The health of a system is not a static accounting of assets and liabilities, but the moment-to-moment outcome of a single, fundamental struggle: the drive to generate and sustain internal coherence against the ceaseless, erosive pressure of the external world. This ledger provides the universal calculus for that struggle, replacing all prior balance equations with the framework's core engine: the Pirouette Lagrangian.
