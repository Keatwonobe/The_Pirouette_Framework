summary: "Purpose
Provide concrete, reproducible procedures to compute Pirouette predictions beyond perturbation by (A) solving the soliton echo problem that generates lepton a_ℓ non‑perturbatively and (B) running a coarse‑graining renormalization group (RG) flow on (Γ,K) to expose UV/IR structure, confinement‑like behavior, and gravity‑limit phenomenology.

Scope
• Observables: a_ℓ (ℓ∈{e,μ,τ}), muonium hyperfine Δν, running α(q²) corrections, EDM suppression checks, and ratio tests (hadronic insulation).
• Outputs are used by the Preregistered Prediction Docket (MATH‑018 P4) and must comply with Dictionary mappings (MATH‑019)."
