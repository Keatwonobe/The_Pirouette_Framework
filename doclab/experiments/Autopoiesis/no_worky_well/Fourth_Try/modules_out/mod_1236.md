To heal a system is not to command it, but to teach it a more graceful song. A Weaver does not act on hope; they act on a well-tested hypothesis. The Crucible of Coherence is the primary instrument for forging that hypothesis. It is a predictive sandbox, a digital rehearsal space where the choreographer of coherence can test and refine their interventions before conducting the final performance.

This module provides the architecture for a simulator that moves beyond simple agent-based modeling. The Crucible models the very geometry of a systemâ€™s coherence manifold, allowing a Weaver to sculpt the landscape of possibility and observe how the system, following the **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)**, rediscovers its own most elegant path from diagnosis to cure.
