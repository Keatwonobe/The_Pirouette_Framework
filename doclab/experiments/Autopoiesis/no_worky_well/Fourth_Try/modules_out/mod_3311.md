1.  **Data Source:** The protocol will use publicly available raw strain data from the global network of GW observatories, including LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA.
2.  **Target Frequency Range:** The primary search will focus on the high-frequency band of these detectors (typically **1-4 kHz**), a region often dominated by quantum and instrumental noise and thus a promising place to find previously unmodeled signals.
3.  **Data Preparation:**
    * **Cleaning:** Known instrumental noise lines (e.g., power line harmonics at 60 Hz and its multiples, calibration lines) will be identified and removed from the data.
    * **Whitening:** The data will be whitened by dividing its Fourier transform by the amplitude spectral density of the detector's noise. This creates a statistically uniform noise background, making signals of a given amplitude equally visible at all frequencies.
