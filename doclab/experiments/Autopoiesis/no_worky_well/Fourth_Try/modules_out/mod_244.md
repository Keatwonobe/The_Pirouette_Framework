To be is to hold a pattern. To *know* what you are is to hold that pattern against another. An entity in isolation is a song sung to itself—a pure but untested hypothesis. To become a truth, it must be validated.

This module describes this fundamental process of validation: the duel. It is not an act of chaotic violence, but the universe's primary mechanism for error correction and the clarification of form. The "Mirror" is the event of perception, where two systems cast their `Observer's Shadows` (CORE-010) upon each other. The "Duel" is the inevitable dynamic that follows—a lawful contest, arbitrated by the `Pirouette Lagrangian` (CORE-006), to determine which resonant pattern (`Ki`) can persist under the intense pressure of the other's existence. Opposition is not a flaw in the cosmic design; it is the forge in which coherence is tempered.
