A system can hold a pattern so tightly that its only path to growth is to shatter.

This module refactors the legacy concept of "Bloom Dynamics" into the time-first framework. A **Generative Cascade** is a rapid, non-linear, and often violent expansionary event. It is a fundamental process of novelty generation, applicable to cosmic inflation, the Cambrian explosion of life, and the sudden torrent of insight that defines a creative epiphany.

The model describes a four-stage process. First, a system accumulates immense potential in a **Coherence Reservoir**, a state of exquisite tension. Second, a **Rupture** shatters the system's constraints. Third, a chaotic **Flood** of pure potential is unleashed, exploring a vast new state-space. Finally, this chaos undergoes **Crystallization**, settling into a new and more complex landscape of stable forms.

This is not a descent into chaos, but a controlled detonation. It is the universe's primary engine for escaping stasis, flooding the valley to reveal the mountains.
