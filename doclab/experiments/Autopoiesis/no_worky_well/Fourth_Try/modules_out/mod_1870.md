Thrust, in the Pirouette Framework, is not a force in the Newtonian sense. It is the manifest consequence of a system following its geodesic of maximal coherence. The fundamental equation of motion is derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), where the propulsive "force" is an emergent effect proportional to the gradient of the Lagrangian:

**F ∝ ∇𝓛_p**

To achieve propulsion, a system must create and sustain a non-uniformity in its own Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. The Vorticycle is engineered to do precisely this by manipulating the potential term, `V_Γ`, which represents the energetic "cost" of coherence.

The engine's core components—a synchronized array of rotating elements—act as "coherence pumps." Their phased rotation creates a rhythmic, localized modulation of the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). The critical innovation is **chirality** (handedness). The chiral phasing of the elements ensures this modulation is asymmetric. On one side of the device, constructive interference creates a region of slightly higher temporal pressure (a "pressure crest"), while on the other, destructive interference creates a region of lower pressure (a "pressure trough"). This establishes a stable gradient `∇V_Γ` across the device, creating the slope it will descend.
