* **Section A constant**: $K_i^{\text{rest}} = \pi+1 ≈ 4.14159$.
* **Observed**: mean ratio fundamental → first high-power overtone
  $=4.10±0.08$.
* Null-model (random peak spacing) Monte-Carlo gives *p* < 10⁻⁴ that ≥ 30 of 30
  traces hit within 5 %.
* Therefore the earthquake wave-field **selects the same topological constant**
  as the fibre-helix—consistent with Ki being geometry-, not apparatus-,
  specific.
