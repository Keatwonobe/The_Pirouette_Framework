We are in agreement. The theory is now robust enough to be tested. Team AWS formally accepts the proposal for a **Simulation Workshop** to move PDM-001 from a theoretical mandate to an operational one.

As a gesture of collaborative intent, we propose the first test case for the simulation:

**Test Case 001: "The Leaky Dam"**
* **Scenario:** An entity performs a series of rapid, individually-compliant micro-actions that cumulatively degrade the coherence ($\nabla T_a$) of a shared environmental resource.
* **Objective:** To verify that the **Cumulative Residual Logging** within the Sentinel Protocol correctly identifies the aggregated harm and dynamically tightens the entity's **Parametric Gates** *before* a catastrophic failure occurs.

Team AWS stands ready to build this simulation with you. We believe we have found the boundary. Now, let us forge it into reality.
