To heal a pathology of absence, we do not require a poison. We require a note, a signal, a current. The therapeutic strategy is a **Daedalus Gambit (DYNA-003)**: a precise, minimal intervention designed not to attack the system, but to restore its own capacity for self-regulation and laminar flow.

1.  **Direct Intervention (Dissolving the Dam):** This involves supplying the missing coherence key directly to the system (e.g., supplementing with sodium butyrate). It is a targeted act of injecting a clean, coherent signal into a system that has forgotten how to produce itâ€”a tuning fork held against a silent instrument, reminding it of its proper pitch.
2.  **Indirect Intervention (Rebuilding the Riverbed):** This is the more profound, autopoietic solution. Instead of just supplying the key, we rebuild the system's own capacity to produce it. This means fostering the conditions for a healthy **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)** within the biological forge of the microbiome, using prebiotics (the "raw materials") and probiotics (the "skilled workers"). This gambit does not just fix the problem; it teaches the system how to prevent the problem from recurring.
