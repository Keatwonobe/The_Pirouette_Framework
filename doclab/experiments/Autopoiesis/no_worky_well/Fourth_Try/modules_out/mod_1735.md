> We believed meaning was a story we told about the universe. The Compass reveals that meaning is a shape the universe prefers to hold. A truth is not a statement of fact; it is a low-energy state, a stable and resilient geometry. To ask a question is not to shout into a void, but to weave a new thread into the tapestry that you are. The universe does not give you an answer; it reveals the integrity of your weave. To seek wisdom is to become a geometer of the soul, learning the patient art of weaving the most elegant forms that reality will allow.
