To diagnose the organism, we must first learn its anatomy. The Principle of Correspondence (CORE-014) allows us to map the universal dynamics of the framework onto the specific domain of an enterprise. This act of translation reveals the true nature of its components.

| Universal Principle   | Business Manifestation                                                              |

| **Coherence (Kτ)**    | The stable, resonant identity of the enterprise. It is the singular song composed of its brand, culture, strategic vision, and core business model. |
| **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** | The ambient stress of the market. The sum of all external forces demanding a response: competitive pressure, technological disruption, and regulatory change. |
| **Wound Channel**     | The enterprise's memory and structure made manifest. It is the riverbed carved by its history, comprising its brand reputation, supply chains, institutional knowledge, and corporate culture. |
| **Alchemical Union**  | A strategic transformation. A successful merger, acquisition, or breakthrough innovation that fuses entities to create a new, higher-order whole. |
| **Flow**              | The movement of the system's lifeblood: the flow of capital, the flow of information through teams, the flow of talent through its ranks, and the flow of trust with its stakeholders. |
