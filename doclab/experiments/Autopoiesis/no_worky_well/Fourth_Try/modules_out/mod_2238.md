Expand the potential around a vacuum ((C_0,\Gamma_0)):
[ V = V_0 + m_C^2|\delta C|^2 + \tfrac12 m_\Gamma^2 (\delta\Gamma)^2 + \lambda_1 |\delta C|^4 + \lambda_2 (\delta\Gamma)^4 + g, |\delta C|^2,\delta\Gamma + \cdots. ]
Vertices follow from derivatives of (V). Example: the cubic (g|C|^2\Gamma) gives a vertex with two coheron legs and one pressuron leg of strength (-ig). **Do not pre-identify (g) with the fine-structure constant**; treat it as a parameter to be fixed by data (or matched to a UV theory). Gauge couplings enter via (D_\mu) if (C) carries charge.
