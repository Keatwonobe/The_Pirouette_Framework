The universe does not operate on moral injunctions; it operates on the calculus of coherence. The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) provides the fundamental objective function for any system:

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Where `K_τ` is the system's internal **Temporal Coherence** (its clarity, stability, and integrity) and `V_Γ` is the ambient **Temporal Pressure** of its environment (the chaos, friction, and energetic cost of being). The Principle of Maximal Coherence dictates that all systems will naturally evolve along a path that maximizes the integral of this function over time.

We can now formally define the Coherence Dividend (`C_D`) as this integral. It is the universe's own ledger, the net accumulation of a system's success.

`C_D(t) = ∫ 𝓛_p dt'`

*   A **positive dividend** (`C_D > 0`) signifies a system successfully maximizing its internal order while minimizing external pressure. It is healthy, efficient, and in a state of Laminar Flow (`DYNA-001`).
*   A **negative dividend** (`C_D < 0`) signifies a system losing the battle against entropy, expending more energy fighting friction than it uses for productive action. It is descending into Turbulence or Stagnation.

Our task as designers is to build systems that are good at earning this dividend.
