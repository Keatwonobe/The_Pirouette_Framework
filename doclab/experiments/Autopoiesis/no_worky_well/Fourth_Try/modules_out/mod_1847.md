The Harmonic Lens is the primary empirical tool for quantifying the **Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`)** term of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`). While a simple sensor might give a single, aggregate value for `Kτ`, this instrument provides its full functional form, `Kτ(ω, t)`.

By integrating the Coherence Spectrum over all frequencies, one can calculate the total `Kτ` at any given moment. By analyzing its shape, one can understand the stability, complexity, and internal dynamics of the `Ki` pattern that the system is manifesting to maximize its Lagrangian. This instrument turns the Lagrangian from a theoretical principle into a predictive, data-driven engine.
