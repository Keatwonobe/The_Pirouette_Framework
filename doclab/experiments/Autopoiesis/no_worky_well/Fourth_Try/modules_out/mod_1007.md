This standard formalizes a resource-efficient approach to diagnostics by layering analytical rigor based on observed risk.

| Tier | Name | Scope & Purpose | Mandatory Operations |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **0** | **Rapid Scan** | Continuous, real-time monitoring; broad environmental sweeps. | Monitor the **Pressure (P)** and **Resonance (R)** channels only using efficient proxies. |
| **1** | **Guard Band** | Anomaly-triggered cross-check to validate the proxy model. | Upon a Sentinel trigger, perform a subsampled, partial solve of the full **Lagrangian (𝓛_p)** to verify the P/R diagnosis. |
| **2** | **Forensic Audit** | Post-incident analysis; deep research; root cause analysis. | Perform a full integration of the **Lagrangian (∫𝓛_p dt)** to map the system's geodesic and derive its equations of motion. |
