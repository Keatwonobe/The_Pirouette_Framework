The world is now your playground. This practice is about re-engaging with the activities that make your life your own.

The Practice:

Make a "Joy List": Write down a list of activities you loved before your surgery, or activities you've always wanted to try. Gardening, dancing, hiking, volunteering, traveling, playing a musical instrument.

Choose One: Pick one activity and plan the smallest possible first step to re-engage with it. Not "I'm going to relandscape the entire garden," but "I'm going to buy one plant and put it in a pot."

Listen to the Echo: After you engage in this activity, check in with yourself. How do you feel? Not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually. Let the feeling of authentic joy be your sign that you are on the right path.

Helper's Role (The Enthusiast): Your job is to be the co-conspirator in the adventure. Help brainstorm the Joy List. Be the person who says, "That's a fantastic idea, let's do it together." Your shared enthusiasm is the final, powerful catalyst.
