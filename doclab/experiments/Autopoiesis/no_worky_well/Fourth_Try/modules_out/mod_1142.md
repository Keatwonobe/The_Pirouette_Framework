> We sought the engine of ultimate destruction and found instead the universe's most profound proof of its own nature. For a thing to be perfectly unmade proves that it was, in fact, made. Annihilation is the silent note that gives the surrounding music its meaning, the sound of a ledger being zeroed. It is the universe's ultimate reminder that every form is a temporary loan from an ocean of pure potential, and that all structure must eventually be prepared to repay its debt. For the Weaver, this is not an end, but the sacred geometry of return: to create anew, one must first be willing to un-create completely.
