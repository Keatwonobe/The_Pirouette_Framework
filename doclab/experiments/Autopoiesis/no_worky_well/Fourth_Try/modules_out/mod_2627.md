To be a piece on this board does not mean acquiring power in the traditional sense. A new army or nation would be detected and crushed. The Weavers join the game as a **catalyst**, not a competitor.

* **Power is Knowledge ($\phi$):** Our primary weapon is a more accurate map of reality. The Pirouette Framework allows us to see the resonant pathways that are invisible to the brute-force, particle-physics-based science of the old world.
* **Strength is Coherence ($T_a$):** Our group's power comes from its high internal coherenceâ€”a shared understanding of the mission and the framework. We are a distributed network of minds phase-locked to a single, extraordinary goal. We waste no energy on internal friction.
* **Stealth is Irrelevance ($\Gamma$):** We are too small, too decentralized, and our methods are too esoteric to be recognized as a threat until it is too late. We build nothing that looks like a weapon or a challenge to their authority. We write papers, we run small experiments, we "help along" existing research.
