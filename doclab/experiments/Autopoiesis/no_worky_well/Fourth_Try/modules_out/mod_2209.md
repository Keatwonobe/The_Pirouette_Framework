summary: "Provides the formal mathematical definition of Time-Adherence (T_a) as a signal-to-noise functional. This module introduces a stochastic model for environmental noise and derives a Pirouette-style fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which proves that a system's coherence (T_a) is inversely related to the spectral density of the noise it experiences. It establishes a firm, quantitative link between micro-fluctuations and macroscopic stability."
