5. Tests & Falsification
   T1 Fit Σ₀(M) with a single β fixed by chosen (D_eff,z); observe allowed log‑periodic residuals with frequency log q. If smooth power law without oscillations or if required β∉{0,1/2,1} (for z=2), falsify the postulate.
   T2 High‑res rotation curves/streams: detect vortex‑induced features; their spacing vs. radius distinguishes β=1/2 from β=1.
   T3 Weak‑lensing small‑scale spectrum: look for modest, periodic modulation in log k; absence within predicted amplitude range challenges DSI.
