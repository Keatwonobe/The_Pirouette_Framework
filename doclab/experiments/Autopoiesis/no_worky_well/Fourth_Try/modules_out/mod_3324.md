The observed frequencies are then compared against the frequencies theoretically predicted by the framework.
* **Process:** The frequencies identified in Phase 2 are checked for mathematical alignment with the theoretically-derived Ki-harmonics from `PPS-033`. The analysis searches for matches with $n \cdot f_{Ki}$, $f_{Ki} / m$, and other simple integer and rational relationships.
* **Outcome:** A **Ki-Resonance Score (0.0 - 1.0)** that quantifies how closely the system's natural rhythms match the fundamental cadence of the Ki constant.
