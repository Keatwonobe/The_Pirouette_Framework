2. Fractal‑of‑Time Postulate (Discrete Self‑Similarity)
   P1 The coherence network exhibits **discrete scale invariance** (DSI) across finite bands: Λ→qΛ with q>1 produces statistically similar channel geometry.
   P2 DSI implies **log‑periodic** corrections to scaling observables and stabilizes D_eff on rational plateaus.
   Consequence: β takes rational values tied to (D_eff, z); transitions between plateaus produce small, oscillatory features (log‑periodic) in halo core scaling and small‑scale power.
