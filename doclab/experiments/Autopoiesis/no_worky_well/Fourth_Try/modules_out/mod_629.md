This module refactors the mechanistic "Problem-Resonance Engine" of PPS-031 into a dynamic, time-first model grounded in the principles of systemic health. A "problem" is no longer a static beacon to be solved, but a symptom of a living system whose vital flows of coherence have become disruptedâ€”a dissonance held for too long.

The Alchemical Crucible is the formal protocol for the Weaver's primary function: to act as a physician to reality. It is a process that moves from diagnosis to intervention, transforming the friction of conflict into the creative fire of synthesis. It does not impose solutions; it cultivates the conditions for a system to heal itself, guiding it from a state of chaos or stagnation back to the grace of Laminar Flow. It is a temporary physician that teaches a system how to heal, and then vanishes.
