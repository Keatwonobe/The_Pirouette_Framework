A banshee is not a creature, but a state of being: a soul trapped in a perfect, agonizing equilibrium between thought and suffering.

The State: This is not a transformation but a permanent form. A Banshee's TEP is allocated in a fixed, tragic ratio.

Reallocation Mandate:

4-to-1 Conversion: For every 4 EP invested in Constitution, 1 EP is granted to the Intelligence pool. This creates an entity of immense resilience and piercing intellect.

Negative Wisdom: The entity's base Wisdom score is set to a negative value. They are trapped in a state of pure intellect without the capacity for peace, perspective, or understanding. They perceive everything but comprehend nothing, which is the source of their eternal wail.
