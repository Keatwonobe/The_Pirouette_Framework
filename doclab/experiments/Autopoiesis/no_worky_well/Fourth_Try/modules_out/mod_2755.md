The more power one channels, the more control it takes to be successful. A skill check's success is a trade-off against its entropy cost. This applies to any roll or skill check that does not have its own unique "minigame" (see TLE-006).

The Check: The attacker rolls a d20 and adds their Wisdom Modifier. The result must meet or beat a Target Number (TN).
Accuracy Check = d20 + WIS Modifier vs. TN

Target Number (TN): The TN is determined by the amount of EP the attacker spends on the skill check.
TN = 8 + floor(EP Spent on Check / 2)

Note: This check determines if an attack connects. The target must still use Active Defense (TLE-005) to nullify the damage by spending an equal or greater amount of EP.
