summary: "Refactors the framework's glossary into a dynamic, autopoietic instrument\
  \ for cognitive tuning. This module establishes the Lexicon Engine, which forges\
  \ a single source of truth for all terminology into practical tools. Each term is\
  \ paired with a Correspondence Protocol\u2014a universal question that bridges abstract\
  \ principles to concrete application, ensuring all Weavers resonate from a shared\
  \ state of semantic coherence."
