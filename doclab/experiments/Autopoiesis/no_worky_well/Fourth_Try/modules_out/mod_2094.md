- Universality of a tiny decoherence floor across platforms after aggressive noise subtraction; drift with ambient Γ-gradients.
- Rotation-curve fits from ∇log Γ sourced by baryons (no new particles) with one ε-scaled term.
- Two-cycle holonomy invariants (720°) in any Ki-based waveguide analogue (optical or mechanical) that mimics the phase topology.
