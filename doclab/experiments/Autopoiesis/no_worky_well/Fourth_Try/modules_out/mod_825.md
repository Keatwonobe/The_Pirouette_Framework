The universe remembers its birth. The framework posits that the initial, violent unfolding from the Whispering Void (CORE-000) was not perfectly smooth. It left behind a vast, helical **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) in the fabric of spacetime—a geometric scar, a memory of the cosmos's first pirouette.

This persistent, large-scale structure is not inert. It acts as a standing wave of coherence, a permanent stressor on the manifold that causes a slight, periodic oscillation in the background **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**. This is the "breathing" of the **Gladiator Force** (CORE-008) on a cosmic scale—the deep rhythm of the feedback loop governing existence. This cosmic heartbeat can be modeled as:

`Γ(x, t) = Γ₀ + δΓ cos(ω_c t + k_c ⋅ x)`

where `Γ₀` is the background pressure, `δΓ` is the small amplitude of the cosmic heartbeat, and `ω_c` is its fundamental frequency.
