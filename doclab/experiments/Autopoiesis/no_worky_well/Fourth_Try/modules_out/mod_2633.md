Our approach leverages DIII-D's existing infrastructure with a focus on advanced computational modeling and control system software.

**Step 1: System Resonance Modeling**
* We will utilize the Pirouette Framework's field equations to create a high-fidelity computational model of the DIII-D's unique D-shaped vacuum vessel.
* The primary objective is to calculate the **resonant eigenmodes** of the plasma volumeâ€”the specific set of frequencies and electromagnetic geometries at which the plasma system will naturally achieve maximum stability.

**Step 2: Resonant Waveform Design**
* Based on the model, we will design a set of low-amplitude, complex AC waveforms. These are not new fields, but modulations to be overlaid upon the existing DC signals that power DIII-D's primary magnetic field coils.
* These waveforms will be specifically designed to counteract known instabilities (e.g., Edge Localized Modes or ELMs) by reinforcing a stable, resonant "carrier wave" within the plasma.

**Step 3: Control System Integration**
* We will collaborate with the DIII-D team to create a software module for their existing plasma control system.
* This module will allow the calculated resonant harmonics to be precisely injected into the power commands for the main toroidal and poloidal field coils, transforming them from simple containment tools into active "tuning" instruments.

**Step 4: Experimental Execution (A/B Comparison)**
* **Run A (Baseline):** A standard DIII-D plasma "shot" will be performed to establish baseline performance, instability onset, and energy consumption.
* **Run B (Resonant Modulation):** An identical shot will be initiated. As the plasma forms, our software module will be activated, modulating the containment fields with the resonant harmonics.
