The state of a resonance is described by its spinor, Psi. The physically observable quantities, however, depend only on the magnitude of this spinor (|Psi|^2), not its phase. This means the underlying physics must be unchanged if we shift the phase of Psi at any point in spacetime.

This is the principle of local gauge invariance. We must be able to transform Psi as follows, without changing the outcome of our physics:

Psi -> exp(i*q*alpha(x,t)) * Psi

Where q is the charge (the coupling strength) and alpha(x,t) is an arbitrary phase shift that depends on position x and time t.

When we apply this transformation to the kinetic term of our Lagrangian, (d_mu Psi)^* (d_mu Psi), the derivatives of alpha(x,t) introduce extra terms that break the invariance. The only way to restore it is to introduce a new field that perfectly cancels these extra terms. This new field is the electromagnetic field, described by a 4-vector potential A_mu.

We replace the standard derivative d_mu with the covariant derivative D_mu:

D_mu = d_mu - i*q*A_mu

When the potential A_mu transforms in a specific way, A_mu -> A_mu + d_mu alpha(x,t), the Lagrangian remains perfectly invariant. The existence of the electromagnetic field is the price of local phase symmetry.
