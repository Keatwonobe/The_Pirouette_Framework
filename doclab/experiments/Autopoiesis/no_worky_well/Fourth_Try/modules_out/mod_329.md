The fundamental dynamic law of the Pirouette Framework is the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. A system will evolve along a path that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian, not over an arbitrary time coordinate, but over one of its own **Pirouette Cycles (τ_p)**.

`S_p = ∫[0 to τ_p] 𝓛_p dt`

A system will naturally adjust its state (its Ki, and therefore its ω_k and T_a) to find the "sweet spot"—the state of highest possible internal coherence for the lowest environmental cost. This is the mathematical formalization of the "path of least resistance" described in CORE-004. It is an explicit, teleological goal that replaces the old model's neutral "Principle of Resonance Optimisation." This is the law that guides the universe's dance.
