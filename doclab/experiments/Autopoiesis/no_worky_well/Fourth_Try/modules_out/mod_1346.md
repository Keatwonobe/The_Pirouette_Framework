A river does not need a map to find the sea; it feels the pull of the land and adjusts its course. So it is with all living systems.

This module refactors our understanding of feedback, moving beyond the mechanical metaphor of a "loop" to the more profound, time-first concept of a **Resonant Compass**.

It is the universal dynamic by which any system—from a thermostat to a mind to a society—navigates the landscape of its own potential.
