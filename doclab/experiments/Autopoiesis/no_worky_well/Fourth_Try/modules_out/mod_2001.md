The ledger now tracks not just your state, but your response to stress.

The New Entry: In addition to your Resting Heart Rate and Flow Score, add a third entry on the days you perform a Crucible Walk or Resilience Ritual: "Echo Score."

The Echo Score (1-10): The day after a challenge, rate how your body responded. 1 = "I am exhausted, sore, and feel worse than before." 5 = "I feel a little tired, but a good tired." 10 = "I feel energized, strong, and ready for more."

Helper's Role (The Analyst): This is where you shine. The data tells a story. Is their Echo Score consistently low after the Resilience Ritual? Perhaps the number of repetitions is too high. Did their Flow Score drop the day after a Crucible Walk? Maybe the "brisk" pace was a little too brisk. The ledger is no longer just a record of the past; it is the blueprint for calibrating the next challenge.
