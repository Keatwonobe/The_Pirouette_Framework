summary: Establishes the Renormalization Flow of Coherence (RFC). Defines scaling operators, beta-functions, fixed points, and crossover structure for Pirouette’s Landau–Pirouette Functional (LPF). Unifies substrate-specific microdynamics with macro-level coherence via RG transformations acting on (a,b,c) and Γ-couplings.
