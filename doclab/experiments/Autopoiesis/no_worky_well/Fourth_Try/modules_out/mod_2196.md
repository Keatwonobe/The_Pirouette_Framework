For many physical systems, we can approximate the potential V(Gamma(r)) with a Taylor expansion around a baseline pressure. A first-order expansion of this feedback mechanism under the conditions of quantum chromodynamics (where the feedback is strong) yields the characteristic potential for a confined system:

V_eff(r) = a/r + b*r

Here:

a/r is the familiar inverse-distance potential, analogous to a Coulomb or gravitational field. It arises from the standard interaction with the field.

b*r is the linear confinement term. It is the direct mathematical consequence of the feedback loop F becoming dominant at larger distances r. This term represents the energy stored in the field between the confined particles.
