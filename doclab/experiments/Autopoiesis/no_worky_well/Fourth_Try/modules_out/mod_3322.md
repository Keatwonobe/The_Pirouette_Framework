To compare disparate data (e.g., text, seismic waves, market data), we must first translate them into a common language.
* **Process:** The raw data is processed through the **Universal Resonance Lens (URL) Forge** as specified in `PPS-015`. The URL's Semantic-Field Transducer maps the input stream into a standardized time-series of the three core Pirouette fields: **Time-Adherence ($T_a(t)$), Gladiator Force ($\Gamma(t)$), and Phase ($\phi(t)$)**.
* **Outcome:** A universal, standardized representation of the data's evolution in the language of resonance.
