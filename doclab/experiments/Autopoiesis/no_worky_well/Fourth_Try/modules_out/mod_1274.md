This framework transforms decay analysis from passive measurement into an active diagnostic tool.

1.  **Isolate the Thread:** Identify and isolate the data stream that represents the system's degrading coherence. This could be the amplitude of a physical wave, the information content of a memory trace, or the signal integrity in a communication channel. This quantity is the measure of the system's remaining `Kτ`.

2.  **Measure the Fade:** Apply the appropriate Unified Fade Equation to the data to extract the empirical **Coherence Lifetime (τ_fade)**. This single metric quantifies the precise rate of decay. The choice of model (simple or oscillatory exponential) is itself a hypothesis about the physics of the system's dissipation.

3.  **Diagnose the Cause:** The crucial insight comes from understanding *why* `τ_fade` has the value it does. Is the system decaying quickly because its internal coherence is low (a weak, frayed thread), or because the external temporal pressure is exceptionally high (a violent storm)? This diagnosis dictates the strategy for intervention. To increase persistence, a Weaver must either **strengthen the thread** (increase `Kτ`) or **shield it from the storm** (decrease local `Γ`).
