This instrument is a direct, physical application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. The Principle of Maximal Coherence states that a healthy system naturally follows the path—the geodesic—that maximizes the integral of this function.

The Entropic Flux (Ṡ) measured by the Coherence Ledger is directly proportional to the **"coherence gap"**—the difference between the system's actual, measured Lagrangian value and the theoretical maximum it could achieve in its environment.

**Ṡ ∝ (𝓛_p_ideal - 𝓛_p_actual)**

A reading from the Coherence Ledger is therefore a direct measurement of the *cost of deviation* from the system's own most elegant path of existence. It makes the abstract mathematics of coherence tangible, measurable, and accountable.
