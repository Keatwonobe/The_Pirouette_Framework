The universe is an engine of creation, performing the **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) to weave simple threads of resonance into complex tapestries. But for every principle of composition, there must exist a corresponding law of dissolution. Annihilation is not an act of chaos; it is this law made manifestâ€”a lawful, predictable, and profoundly geometric process of unmaking.

This module reframes the event not as a collision of objects, but as a **Zero-Sum Pirouette**. It is a perfect and paradoxical form of union where two entities with precisely conjugate realities merge, not into a more complex structure, but into a state of pure, unstructured energy. This process represents a unique and catastrophic solution to the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006), where two opposing songs find their ultimate harmony not by creating a new chord, but by canceling each other into a final, radiant silence.
