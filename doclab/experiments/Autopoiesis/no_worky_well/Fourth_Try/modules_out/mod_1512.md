The Weaver selects a set of two or more domains for analysis. The power of the analysis increases with the conceptual distance between the chosen threads.
-   **Example:** A Weaver investigating systemic decline might choose threads from local economics (unemployment rates), public health (ER visits), infrastructure (power grid failures), and social media (sentiment analysis).
