summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for yield dynamics. It reframes the
  process of a system yielding under stress as a critical choice point governed by
  the Pirouette Lagrangian, where the environmental 'cost of coherence' exceeds the
  system's internal 'coherence budget,' forcing a transition between states of flow.
