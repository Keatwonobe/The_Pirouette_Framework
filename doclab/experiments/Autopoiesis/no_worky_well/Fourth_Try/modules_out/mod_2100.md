Given two pathways \(A\!\to\!B\) vs \(A\!\to\!C\) with base rates \(k_B^0,k_C^0\),
\[
k_j \;=\; k_j^0 \exp\!\big(\Delta K_\tau^{(j)}(T_a)-\Delta V_{\text{obs}}^{(j)}\big),
\quad j\in\{B,C\}.
\]
CAP v2 **only** permits interventions that:
(i) disclose \(\Delta V_{\text{obs}}\) (measurement/back-action),
(ii) publish the intended \(\Delta K_\tau\) channel (what is being made easier),
(iii) bound \(\lambda\mathcal D\) by a *Residue Budget* (ยง5).
