Define scale transformation with factor ℓ>1:

x → x' = x/ℓ,   ψ(x) → ψ'(x') = ℓ^{ζ} ψ(x)

Choose ζ so that the gradient term remains form-invariant:

c|∇ψ|^2 → c'|∇'ψ'|^2 with c' = c

This yields ζ = (2−d)/2.

Coupling rescalings at tree level:

a' = ℓ^2 a,   b' = ℓ^{4−d} b

Γ enters via U(Γ,S); write the leading Γ-coupling as λ multiplying |ψ|^2Γ, giving λ' = ℓ^{2−d} λ at tree level.
