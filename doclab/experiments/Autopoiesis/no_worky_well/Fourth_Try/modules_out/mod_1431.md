This is the practical workflow for generating a complete Coherence Ledger from a single, known potential.

1.  **Anchor the Measurement:** Begin with a complete description of one thermodynamic potential in its natural variables. For example, an equation for Helmholtz Free Energy, F(T,V). This is your anchor point on the manifold.
2.  **Use the Compass:** Apply the Legendre Compass. Calculate the partial derivatives of your anchor potential with respect to its natural variables to find their conjugates. (e.g., From F(T,V), derive S and P).
3.  **Complete the Ledger:** Use the inverse transforms—the fundamental thermodynamic relations—to reconstruct all other potentials from the information you now have.
    *   `U = F + TS`
    *   `H = U + PV`
    *   `G = H - TS`

The output is the Coherence Ledger: a complete set of functions for U, F, H, G, S, T, P, and V. You have transformed one complete path up the mountain into a topographical map of the entire mountain.
