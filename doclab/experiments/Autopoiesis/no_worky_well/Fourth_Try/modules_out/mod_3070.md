\section*{§2 · Residual Stiffness in the Low-Coherence Limit}
Let $\Gamma(\tau)=\Gamma_0+\delta\Gamma(\tau)$ with $\langle\delta\Gamma\rangle=0$.  
From the substrate action,
\[
\langle V(\Gamma)\rangle = V(\Gamma_0) + 
\frac{1}{2}V''(\Gamma_0)\langle(\delta\Gamma)^2\rangle + \cdots .
\]
As coherence length $L_c\to\infty$, fluctuations freeze out and the remaining potential energy
\[
\rho_{\Gamma,\text{res}} = \frac{1}{2}V''(\Gamma_0)\langle(\delta\Gamma)^2\rangle
\]
acts as a uniform background pressure.
