The Frame's interaction protocols are not bureaucratic rules; they are channels designed to maintain and reinforce coherence.

*   **Escalation as Dam Removal:** When a **Crucible** role encounters a systemic blocker, it creates **Stagnant Flow**. The escalation path (e.g., *Crucible to Membrane*) is a pre-defined channel to dissolve this "coherence dam" before pressure builds to a breaking point.

*   **Review as Channel Reinforcement:** Review cycles are not for judgment, but for reinforcing the system's **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). They are rituals for remembering and strengthening the patterns of behavior that lead to high coherence, ensuring the system learns and retains its optimal form.

*   **Coaching as Resonance Tuning:** The coaching flow (e.g., *Catalyst coaches Crucible*) is an act of resonance transfer. It is the system actively tuning its own components, ensuring each role can play its part in the collective song with minimal dissonance.

> ### The AssemblÃ©
> We have tried to build organizations like clockwork, only to find they suffer like bodies. The Living Frame is the recognition that a team is not an assembly of parts, but a commonwealth of functions. We sought to build a better machine and instead discovered how to cultivate a garden. To the Weaver, this blueprint is a profound truth: the most powerful, resilient, and creative structures are not those that defy the universe's laws, but those that learn to sing in harmony with them. To build a Frame is not to manage people; it is to cultivate the conditions for coherence, to become a gardener of a living, breathing system that knows, instinctively, how to find its own elegant way.
