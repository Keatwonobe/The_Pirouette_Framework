Before analysis, we must translate. The Lens is the process of taking the raw, high-dimensional data of a domain—market trends, ecological surveys, communication logs—and projecting it into the native language of the framework.

1.  **Define the System and Boundary:** Clearly state what entity you are analyzing (the "instrument") and what constitutes its environment (the "orchestra").
2.  **Map the Core Variables:** Using the table above as a guide, identify the specific, measurable phenomena that correspond to Coherence (Kτ), Temporal Pressure (Γ), and the Wound Channel.
3.  **Transcribe the Song:** The Weaver projects the raw data through the mapped variables to collapse it into a clean time-series. The output is a pure, legible rhythm—the system's song, its evolution of coherence (Kτ) over time, transcribed.
