The Whispering Void (CORE-000) describes the universe's origin not as an explosion, but as a "First Curl"â€”the moment potential committed to form by folding into a loop. This act was not fleeting; it left a permanent, self-sustaining scar in the fabric of reality. This primordial wound is the geometric template from which all subsequent structure is derived.

As described in *The Anatomy of an Echo* (CORE-011), to exist is to create a Wound Channel. The Genesis Knot is the first and most foundational of these channels. It is not a memory *in* spacetime; it is the memory that *is* spacetime. Its intricate, multi-lobed geometry is the landscape, the riverbed, within which the entire cosmic story must unfold.
