* **Successful Detection:** A successful result is the identification of a statistically significant, rhythmic train of high-frequency GW bursts that is coincident in multiple detectors and is not vetoed by known noise sources. The measured `f_burst` and `f_rhythm` would be used with the Tuning Law from `PPS-071` to infer the Maw's mass, spin, and distance, thereby providing the first direct measurement of the Γ field's properties in a strong-field regime.
* **Falsification:** A comprehensive, long-term search that yields a null result would place increasingly stringent upper limits on the existence and population of Maws. A persistent failure to detect any Thumper candidates would strongly disfavor the Maw hypothesis and, by extension, challenge the Γ scaling law, thereby falsifying a core component of the framework.
