summary: "Establishes the integrity protocol for the framework's evolution. This module\
  \ defines the 'Ritual of Provenance,' a CI/CD workflow that uses a cryptographic\
  \ hash\u2014the 'Seal of Coherence'\u2014to verify the internal consistency of the\

  \ history becomes a high-fidelity Wound Channel."
