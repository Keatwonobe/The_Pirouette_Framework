To the family member or friend assisting in this recovery: your role is one of the most powerful in this process. You are not a nurse or a doctor. You are an Anchor. A ship in a storm needs an anchor not to pull it, but to provide a single point of profound stability. That is your purpose.

Your three primary functions are:

To Be a Calm Presence: Your calm, steady rhythm is a gift of coherence. When the patient is in a turbulent state of anxiety or pain, your own stable presence acts as a tuning fork, inviting their system to find a calmer note.

To Listen: Your most powerful tool is your attention. Listen to their words, and listen to the silence between them. You are the primary sensor for their needs, their fears, and their small victories.

To Guard the Harbor: Protect the patient's recovery space from unnecessary stress. You are the guardian of their quiet, the protector of their rest.
