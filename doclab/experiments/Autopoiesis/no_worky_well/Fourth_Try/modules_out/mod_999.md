**Hypothesis:** High-volatility financial events represent phase transitions in collective human behavior, governed by the principles of **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**. These transitions should exhibit signatures of the framework's stability boundaries.

**Finding:** The framework's core resonant values mark a critical, non-trivial boundary in the distribution of market volatility (volume kurtosis). They are the threshold where the system's Ki pattern shifts from normal stochastic behavior into a distinct, high-energy resonant state of panic (Turbulence) or herd behavior (Coherence).

**Lagrangian Connection:** A market crash is a coherence collapse. The system's K_τ dissolves as its V_Γ (panic, uncertainty) spikes, entering a high-action state of turbulent search. The observed values mark the geometric edge of the market's stable manifold.
