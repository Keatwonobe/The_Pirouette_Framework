summary: A comprehensive framework that applies the Caduceus Lens to sports analytics,
  reframing a match as a dynamic contest between two systems striving for coherence.
  This module provides both the theoretical lens for diagnosing a team's health via
  its flow state (Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant) and the practical instrumentation
  for translating real-time observations into predictive insights about the game's
  outcome (Victor Tilt), margin (Spread Delta), and tempo (Pace Delta).
