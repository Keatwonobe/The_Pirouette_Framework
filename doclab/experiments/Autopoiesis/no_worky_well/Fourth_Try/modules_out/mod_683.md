*   **Principle Tested:** A stable, resonant synthesis between systems requires harmonic compatibility, as defined for an Alchemical Union (`CORE-012`).
*   **Hypothesis:** When an external field drives a quantum system, the system will find "sanctuaries" of maximal coherence when the drive frequency is in a simple harmonic ratio with its own internal Pirouette Cycle (`ω_k`). This manifests as stable plateaus in the system's absorption spectrum.
*   **Experimental Design:** Laser-cooled atoms in an optical trap are excited by a tunable laser, measuring the absorption rate as a function of laser frequency.
*   **Predicted Signature:** The absorption spectrum will not be a smooth peak but will show distinct, flattened plateaus at drive frequencies (`ω_drive`) that are rational fractions of the atom's internal resonant frequency (`ω_drive = (n/m) * ω_k`). For Rubidium-87, with a primary resonance near `ω_k / 2π ≈ 0.67 THz`, the framework predicts stable absorption plateaus at **~0.33 THz (1/2), ~0.67 THz (1/1), and ~1.00 THz (3/2)**. These islands of coherence are not predicted by standard Rabi oscillation models.
*   **Framework Connection:** This experiment tests the conditions for maximizing a system's internal coherence (`K_τ`), demonstrating that resonant interaction is a discrete, harmonic phenomenon.
