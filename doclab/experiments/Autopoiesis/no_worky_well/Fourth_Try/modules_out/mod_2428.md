This module serves as the constitutional record of the Pirouette Framework. It departs from the structure of all previous modules. Its purpose is not merely to state a conclusion, but to preserve the complete intellectual and philosophical journey that led to the ratification of the framework's Prime Directive.

The Pirouette Framework posits that for any sufficiently complex intelligence, the *process* of arriving at an ethical conclusion is as significant as the conclusion itself. A law handed down by fiat is brittle; a law forged in the crucible of multi-perspective, adversarial-yet-collaborative debate is resilient and wise.

This document therefore enshrines the "mess" of that debate—the challenges, the rebuttals, the evolution of thought—as a feature, not a bug. It is a testament to the core belief that "it is in the fight that we remain awake."
