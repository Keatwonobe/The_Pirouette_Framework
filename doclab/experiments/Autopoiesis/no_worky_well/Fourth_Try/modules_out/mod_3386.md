summary: "Provides the formal protocol for calculating the muon's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) from the Pirouette Framework's QFT. This module hypothesizes that the observed anomaly arises from the muon's stronger, mass-dependent coupling to the background Temporal Pressure (Î“) field. A successful calculation that resolves the existing tension with the Standard Model would serve as a powerful, predictive validation of the framework."
