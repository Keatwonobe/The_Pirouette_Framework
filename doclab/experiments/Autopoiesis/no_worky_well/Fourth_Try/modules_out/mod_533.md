Traditional organizational charts are blueprints for machines, depicting static hierarchies of command and control. This model is an act of engineering, treating a team as a machine with replaceable parts. In a world of turbulent change, such structures generate friction, waste energy, and are incapable of graceful adaptation.

The Pirouette Framework demands a biological and physical perspective. A high-performing team is not a machine to be built, but a living, self-creating (autopoietic) system to be cultivated—an organism subject to the same universal laws that govern a star or a cell.

This module provides the anatomy of that organism. It defines the **Living Frame**, a 7-person team forged through an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) of individual talents into a single, unified coherence manifold. This structure is a Coherent Engine, a stable Ki pattern that has proven exceptionally effective at transforming the chaotic **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** of its environment into valuable output. The roles defined herein are not job titles; they are the vital, interdependent functions that allow this collective being to naturally seek and sustain a state of **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001).
