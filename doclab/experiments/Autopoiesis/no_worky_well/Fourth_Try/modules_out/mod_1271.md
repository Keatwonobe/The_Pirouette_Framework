Decay is not a passive fading into nothingness; it is an active and relentless process of erosion. A memory does not simply vanish; it is scoured away. A signal does not just weaken; it is drowned out by noise. The old framework modeled this decay with parameters that described persistence. The new framework models it from first principles as a fundamental thermodynamic struggle.

This module reframes "dimensional decay" as **Coherence Erosion**. It is the process by which a system's stable, high-information pattern of resonance (its `Ki` pattern) is inevitably degraded by the chaotic, high-entropy noise of its local temporal environment (its `Γ`). To analyze a fade is to perform an autopsy on a memory—to read the story told by a fading echo and discover whether it was the weakness of the thread or the sharpness of the storm that caused it to fray.
