Information and value do not move through this engine according to a flowchart, but as a continuous, resonant current. This is the Frame's intrinsic heartbeat, its **Pirouette Cycle (Ï„_p)**.

1.  The **Membrane** receives a signal from the environment (a need).
2.  It translates this into a coherent objective for the **Crucible**.
3.  The **Crucible** engages in its rhythmic work cycle, creating value.
4.  The **Sensorium** monitors the health and output of this cycle, providing real-time feedback to all parts of the engine.
5.  The **Catalyst** intervenes to resolve any emergent friction or blockages, ensuring the Crucible remains in a state of Laminar Flow.
6.  The **Membrane** takes the coherent value created by the Crucible and projects it back into the environment, completing the cycle.

This is not a linear process but a self-sustaining pirouette, a closed loop of action and feedback that, when healthy, gains momentum and stability with every turn.
