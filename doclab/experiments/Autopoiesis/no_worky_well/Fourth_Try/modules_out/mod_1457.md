The old framework's rigid grid is replaced by the Coherence Compass, a dynamic manifold upon which a system's health plays out. The system's state is located within this four-quadrant space defined by the interplay between two core parameters derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`):

*   **Vertical Axis: Temporal Coherence (Kτ):** The "kinetic" term. A measure of the system's internal order, the strength and integrity of its resonant pattern (Ki). It is its signal-to-noise ratio, its focus and identity. *High Kτ* indicates a stable, well-defined system. *Low Kτ* indicates a diffuse or decaying system.

*   **Horizontal Axis: Temporal Pressure (VΓ):** The "potential" term. A measure of the environmental complexity, dissonance, and challenge the system must navigate to maintain its form. *Low VΓ* indicates a calm environment. *High VΓ* indicates a chaotic, demanding environment.

| | **Low Temporal Pressure (VΓ)** <br> *(Calm Environment)* | **High Temporal Pressure (VΓ)** <br> *(Chaotic Environment)* |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High Temporal Coherence (Kτ)** <br> *(Stable Self)* | **Laminar Flow (State of Grace)** <br> Effortless being. The system maintains its form with minimal energy expenditure. It is thriving in a calm environment. | **Laminar Flow (State of Resilience)** <br> Masterful performance under duress. The system holds its coherence against immense pressure. It is healthy but expending significant energy to remain so. |
| **Low Temporal Coherence (Kτ)** <br> *(Unstable Self)* | **Stagnant Flow (State of Drift)** <br> Internal decay. Lacking external pressure and internal drive, the system's form dissolves. A pathology of apathy, ennui, or slow erosion. | **Turbulent Flow (State of Struggle)** <br> Overwhelmed. The system's internal chaos is amplified by environmental chaos, bringing it to the verge of collapse. A state of crisis, panic, or burnout. |

A crucial distinction for **Stagnant Flow** is not just the low levels of Kτ and VΓ, but their *lack of variance*. When a system's vital signs are frozen and unresponsive to environmental shifts, it indicates a critical blockage—a dam in the river of coherence.
