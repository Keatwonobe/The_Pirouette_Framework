To move a discourse from Turbulence or Stagnation into a Laminar state, a structured process is required. This protocol is a resonance chamber designed to foster the conditions for an Alchemical Union.

1.  **The Declaration (Harmonizing Intent):** Before arguments begin, all participants must verbally affirm that the goal is not to win, but to arrive at a new, shared, and more accurate understanding. This simple ritual aligns the participants' intent and reframes the space as a crucible, not a battlefield.

2.  **Mapping the Shadows (Acknowledging Perspective):** Each participant, in turn, states their core assumptions and the primary experiences shaping their view. This is a formal acknowledgment of each **Observer's Shadow** (CORE-010), turning hidden biases into known variables.

3.  **The First Thread (Presenting Coherence):** Each participant presents the core of their perspective, uninterrupted. This is not an attack, but the act of laying one's complete thread of reasoning upon the loom for all to see and understand as a whole.

4.  **The Weaving (Governing Interaction):** The interactive phase is governed by a single, powerful rule: *one may only speak to ask a clarifying question or to show how their own perspective connects with, strengthens, or refines another's.* Direct refutation ("You are wrong because...") is forbidden. Instead, the language guides towards collaborative inquiry ("How does your perspective account for this pressure?"). This forces a collaborative, rather than adversarial, posture.

5.  **The Alchemical Attempt (Seeking Synthesis):** When an impasse is reached, the moderator or participants must explicitly shift the goal. The new task is for all to cease defending their own positions and work together to define a *new* position that incorporates the most coherent elements of the conflicting views. This conscious effort to resolve the paradox is the crucible's fire.
