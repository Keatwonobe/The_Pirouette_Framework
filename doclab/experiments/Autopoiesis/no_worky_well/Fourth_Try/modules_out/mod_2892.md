An entity that has mastered the flow of Entropy, navigated the web of factions, and survived the crucible of adventure eventually reaches a final frontier. Their challenges are no longer about defeating a single foe or acquiring a single treasure, but about shaping the fabric of reality itself. This is the art of Metaphysical Engineering: the ultimate expression of will, where a character transitions from being a participant in the world to being a co-creator of its future. This module provides the rules for this endgame play, where the greatest reward is not what you can find, but what you can build.
