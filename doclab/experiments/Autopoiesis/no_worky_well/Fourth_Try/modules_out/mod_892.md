The perfect map of the ocean is useless to a sailor caught in a storm. The perfect path, calculated too late, is the path to ruin.

The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) provides the "perfect map"â€”a mathematical description of a system's geodesic of maximal coherence. To calculate this path with complete fidelity requires immense resources, a luxury unavailable in the turbulent flow of real-time events. To wait for perfect knowledge is often to cede the territory.

This module provides the disciplined art of principled approximation. It is the formal protocol for distilling the universal, computationally-intensive laws of the framework into a **Geodesic Compass**. This compass is an engine for navigating the coherence manifold not with a perfect map, but with a reliable needle that always points toward the wisest *timely* action, trading the paralysis of perfect analysis for the grace of the next right step.
