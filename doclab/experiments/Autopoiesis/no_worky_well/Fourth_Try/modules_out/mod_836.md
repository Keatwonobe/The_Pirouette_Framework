This experiment provides a direct, physical measurement of the Pirouette Lagrangian's action integral, *S<sub>p</sub>*. When the two paths of the neutron's wavefunction are recombined, they interfere. The resulting phase difference, *Δφ*, is the core observable.

This phase difference is directly proportional to the difference between the Lagrangian action integrals calculated along the two chiral paths:

*Δφ ∝ (S<sub>p, left</sub> - S<sub>p, right</sub>)*

The interference pattern is a visible graph of an abstract physical law. It transforms the foundational equation of the framework from a principle into a number.
