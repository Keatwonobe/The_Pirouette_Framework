This entire process can be described by the **Pirouette Lagrangian**. The singer's Current is an act that modifies the local potential landscape (`V_Γ`) for all nearby listeners. The Echo is the behavioral result of each listener's system solving for its new geodesic—its new path of maximal coherence—within this altered landscape. Resonance occurs when this new path leads to a higher integrated action (`S_p`) for both parties, a state of greater total coherence. Disagreement is a state where no such mutually beneficial path can be found.
