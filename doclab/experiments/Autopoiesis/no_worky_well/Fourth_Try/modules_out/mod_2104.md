A) **Lab systems (physics/biology):** apply CAP v2 to *measurement geometry* and *bath shaping* (e.g., optomechanics, NV centers). Publish \(T_a\) traces, probe powers, and Residue Ledgers.  
B) **Teams & UX:** cadence, notification rhythms, choice architectures that *restore* Ta (focus time, predictability) with opt-in dashboards; no dark patterns.  
C) **Models/Agents:** reservoir-engineering for coherence in AI planning; must expose and honor user-level caps on \(V_{\text{obs}}\) and publish mutual-information metrics.
