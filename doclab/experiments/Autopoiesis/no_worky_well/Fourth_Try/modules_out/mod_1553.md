summary: Provides a formal, time-first model for the act of measurement, replacing
  the 'observer effect' with a geometric principle. Measurement is defined as casting
  an Observer's Shadow onto a system's coherence manifold, creating a Measurement
  Echo. This module introduces the Shadow Gauge Protocol, an instrumental method for
  quantifying the energetic and geometric impact of any observation via its effect
  on the system's Pirouette Lagrangian.
