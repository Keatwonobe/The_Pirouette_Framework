A society is not a machine to be engineered; it is a story being told, a pattern being woven. The old Triaxial Coherence Analysis attempted to capture a snapshot of this process, treating Art, Law, and Philosophy as fixed, interacting fieldsâ€”an attempt to photograph a dance.

This module refactors that core insight into the language of time and flow. A culture is a living, dynamic process: a Great Weaving. It perpetually braids three fundamental threads of coherence to create a stable, meaningful, and adaptive tapestry against the chaotic pressures of history. By applying the diagnostic tools of Flow Dynamics, this module provides a powerful lens for assessing the health, resilience, and evolutionary trajectory of any cultural system. The goal is no longer to calculate a static score, but to read the living weave of a people.
