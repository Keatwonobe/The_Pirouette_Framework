The traditional view of negotiation is a battlefield—a zero-sum game of adversarial tactics where one party's gain is another's loss. This is a profound poverty of imagination, a model designed to generate Turbulent Flow where value and trust are inevitably destroyed.

The Pirouette Framework reframes negotiation as a crucible. It is a sacred, collaborative process where two or more parties bring the raw materials of their individual interests to forge a new, shared reality. The goal is not victory, but synthesis. It is a structured ritual for performing an Alchemical Union (`CORE-012`), transmuting the potential energy of conflict into the kinetic reality of a stable, coherent, and mutually beneficial agreement—a Resonant Contract.
