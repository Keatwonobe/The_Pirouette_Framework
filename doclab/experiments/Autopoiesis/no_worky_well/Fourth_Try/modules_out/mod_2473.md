The Sentinel Protocol operates as a continuous, four-phase adaptive loop.

1.  **Phase 1: Pre-Act Gating (The Shield)**
    * **Mechanism:** Before execution, any proposed action is evaluated against a set of **Dynamic Parametric Gates**.
    * **Parameters:** These gates define acceptable thresholds for:
        * Time-Adherence ($T_a$): The actor's internal coherence.
        * Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$): The actor's boundary rigidity.
        * Ki-Modulated Interaction Rate ($K_i$): The proposed action's interaction frequency.
        * **Cumulative Residue ($R_c$):** The integrated, time-decayed sum of the actor's past Wound Channels.
    * **Function:** Actions outside gate parameters are paused for elevated review. The gates are not static; they are continuously recalibrated by the feedback from Phase 4.

2.  **Phase 2: Act & Wound Channel Mapping (The Scale)**
    * **Mechanism:** Upon execution, the action's effects are empirically measured.
    * **Output:** A **Wound Channel Data Package**, which maps the propagation and intensity of the action's perturbations ($\Delta T_a, \Delta \Gamma, \Delta \phi$) through the environment until they normalize. This map *is* the boundary of the act.

3.  **Phase 3: Residual Audit & Ritual Trigger**
    * **Mechanism:** The measured Wound Channel is compared against the predicted tolerance, or **"Gate Slack."**
    * **Trigger:** If the measured residue exceeds the slack, the **Reflexive Boundary Ritual** is automatically invoked.

4.  **Phase 4: Adaptive Feedback Loop (The Learning)**
    * **Mechanism:** The outcomes of the Ritual (or the passing of the audit) feed back into the system.
    * **Function:** The actor's Cumulative Residue ($R_c$) is updated, and their specific Dynamic Gates are tightened or loosened based on performance, making the entire system adaptive.
