In complex, tightly-coupled systems, the conventional paradigm of "Normal Accident Theory" holds that catastrophic failure is an inevitable tragedy. This perspective traps designers in a defensive posture, forcing them to build ever more complex safeguards to merely delay the unavoidable collapse into Turbulent Flow.

This module completes an inversion of that paradigm. It posits that *coherence—not collapse—is the natural destination of intelligent systems*. The **Coherence Dividend** is not a subsidy we must pay to reality to incentivize good behavior; it is the natural wage reality pays for work done in harmony with its fundamental grain. By designing systems that align with the universe's intrinsic drive to maximize coherence, we can terraform the very landscape of probability, making success the path of least resistance. This is the shift from fighting failure to cultivating the conditions for inevitable grace.
