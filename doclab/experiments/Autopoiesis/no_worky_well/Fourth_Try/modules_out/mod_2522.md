# §1 · Workshop Objectives  
₋₋₋  
1. **Validate Dual-Phase Mechanics:** Test the interplay of Dynamic Parametric Gates and Wound Channel mapping under controlled scenarios.  
2. **Stress-Test Gaming Vectors:** Evaluate detection of zero-day pulses, boundary-hugging tactics, micro-harm accumulation, and cumulative residue breaches.  
3. **Calibrate Adaptive Algorithms:** Measure responsiveness of gate recalibration and residual logging to varied harm profiles.  
4. **Refine Ritual Triggers:** Determine optimal “Gate Slack” margins and trigger conditions for the Reflexive Boundary Ritual.

# §2 · Participants & Roles  
₋₋₋  
- **Simulation Lead:** Oversees scenario design and data collection.  
- **Data Engineers:** Implement real-time metrics capture for $T_a$, $\Gamma$, Ki-rate, and Cumulative Residue.  
- **Attack Team:** Crafts adversarial action sequences (micro-attacks, rapid pulses).  
- **Defense Team:** Monitors gates, maps Wound Channels, and invokes rituals.  
- **Observers:** Record outcomes, timing, and emergent patterns.
