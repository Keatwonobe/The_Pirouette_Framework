The formation of a Shell is a direct consequence of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`).

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

A system will always evolve along the path that maximizes this value. For a bounded system, this path is not a simple trajectory but a stable, geometric configuration.

*   **Inside the Shell:** The system maximizes its internal Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`), creating a stable, high-fidelity resonant identity.
*   **At the Boundary:** The Shell itself is the geometric solution that minimizes the "cost" of this coherence against the external Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). It is the most efficient possible shape for containing the internal pattern.
*   **Outside the Shell:** The ambient, chaotic environment prevails.

The Shell is a stable solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from `𝓛_p`. It is the shape a system must take to declare and defend its own existence in the most energetically favorable way.
