The search for Ki is not a search for a number, but for a **signature of behavior**. A system is considered Ki-resonant if it exhibits a multi-faceted signature characterized by:

* **Periodicity:** The system's dynamics show cycles whose frequencies have a clear harmonic relationship with the base Ki constants (`Ki_rest` and `Ki_motion`).
* **Symmetry:** The system's structure or phase space exhibits symmetries related to the threefold geometry that underpins the Ki constant's origin.
* **Phase Evolution:** The system's state transitions over time follow the patterns and rules described by the Ki-Mode & Phase Algebra of `PPS-002`.
