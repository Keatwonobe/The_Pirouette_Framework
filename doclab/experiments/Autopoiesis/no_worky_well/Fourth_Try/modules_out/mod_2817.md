A 5-foot square of terrain that has been made difficult—such as by creating slick ice, grasping thorns, or super-heated air—impedes movement.

Movement Cost: To move through a 5-foot square of difficult terrain, a creature must succeed on a d2 roll. On a result of 1, their movement for the turn ends, though they still expend 5 feet of movement.

Creating Difficult Terrain: As an action, a character can spend 3 EP to make a 5-foot square within 30 feet into difficult terrain.

Intensifying Terrain: A character can intensify an existing patch of difficult terrain by spending an additional 5 EP. For each 5 EP spent in this way, a creature must make one additional successful d2 roll to pass through the 5-foot square.

Verticality & Falling: Each d2 roll required to move through a space is considered the equivalent of 5 feet of movement for the purposes of verticality. A creature falling through a 15-foot cube of turbulent air would need to make three successful d2 rolls to stop their fall; failure would result in them taking fall damage.
