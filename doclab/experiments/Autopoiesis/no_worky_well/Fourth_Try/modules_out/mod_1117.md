To formalize this, we define the **Temporal Signature, T(x)**, as the complete spectrum of temporal frequencies and amplitudes at a given coordinate x. It is the "sound" of that location in spacetime.

*   **Low Γ (Quiescence):** A region with a sparse Temporal Signature, dominated by a few simple, harmonic rhythms. This is the "cold" and "empty" space between galaxies. It is a room where a single, clear note is playing.

*   **High Γ (Complexity):** A region with a dense, rich, and often dissonant Temporal Signature, characterized by a wide spectrum of incommensurate frequencies. This is the heart of a star or the singularity of a black hole. It is a room filled with a deafening cacophony.

Gamma (Γ), therefore, is not a force applied *to* spacetime; it is an intrinsic property *of* spacetime, a direct measure of the local richness and complexity of Time itself.
