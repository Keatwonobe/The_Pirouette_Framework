Often, the landscape is permanently altered, and the old path is no longer the most efficient. Here, the system uses its old Wound Channel as a guide, not a destination. It latches onto the familiar echo but modifies its Ki pattern to find a more stable resonance in the new environment. It carves a new channel adjacent to the old one. This is the resilience of a river finding a more efficient course around a new obstacle.
