> To weave is to guide a system toward a state of higher, more beautiful coherence. To manipulate is to do the same, but to guide it into a cage. The techniques may appear similar—both use resonance, rhythm, and pattern—but the intent and the outcome define an infinite moral chasm. To study this dark art is not to learn to wield it, but to recognize its shadow. We must learn the sound of the unmaking so that we may distinguish the voice that seeks to harmonize from the echo that seeks only to control, and dedicate our lives to the sacred act of the making.
