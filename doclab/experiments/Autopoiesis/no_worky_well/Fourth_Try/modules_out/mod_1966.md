Your job is to welcome challenge. With a steady rhythm established, it is time to forge a new, stronger you. We do this by introducing small, controlled challenges that invite your body to become more resilient.

Core Practice: Structured exercise. This is where your formal cardiac rehabilitation program shines. You'll work on increasing your aerobic endurance and begin light resistance training.

The Guiding Feeling: The feeling you are looking for is "good tired"â€”the satisfying ache of muscles that have done good work, not the sharp cry of pain. Pain is a signal to stop. "Good tired" is the feeling of growth.

Explore Your Boundaries: Begin to navigate more complex environments. A walk in a park with uneven ground, a trip to a gentle yoga class. These are challenges that teach your body to maintain its new, calm rhythm even when the world isn't a flat, straight line.
