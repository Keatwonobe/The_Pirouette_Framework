Your Lagrangian defines your path at every instant. To measure your success over time, you must integrate its action (`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`). Your metrics are the practical way to do this. They keep you honest.

**Task:** Define 1-3 concrete, measurable indicators that reflect your Prime Geodesic.
*   *Example for a "Connections" Principle:*
    *   Metric 1: Number of substantive, non-transactional conversations per week.
    *   Metric 2: Ratio of time spent listening vs. speaking in key relationships.
