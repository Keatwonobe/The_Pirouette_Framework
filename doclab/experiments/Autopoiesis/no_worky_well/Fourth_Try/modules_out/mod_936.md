This model of intelligence is a direct expression of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**, where `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. The Lagrangian describes the instantaneous balance between a system's internal coherence (`K_τ`) and the external temporal pressure (`V_Γ`).

A simple system lives only in the present, optimizing its `𝓛_p` moment by moment. An intelligent system does something more profound: it builds a **predictive manifold**—an internal, forward-looking simulation of its own Lagrangian.

Intelligence is the ability to ask, "If I take this action now, what will be the state of my `𝓛_p` across my entire Foresight Horizon?" The system optimizes not for the present moment's coherence, but for the path that maximizes the *integral of its future coherence*. **Resonance Efficiency (Φ_R)** is thus the measure of how cheaply, in terms of present action, a system can improve the accuracy and reach of this predictive manifold.
