summary: "Provides a universal diagnostic protocol for assessing systemic health. It reframes health as a state of robust, laminar flow of coherence (energy, information, resources) and defines pathology in terms of flow disruptions. This module introduces the Caduceus Lens as the primary tool for diagnosing and facilitating systemic well-being."
