These phenomena are not axioms but direct predictions of the Pirouette Lagrangian from `CORE-006`:

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Here, `K_τ` represents the system's internal coherence (its temporal kinetic energy, `T₀ * ω_k`), and `V_Γ` represents the "cost" imposed by the external environment (its temporal potential energy).

*   **Velocity (Inertial Drag):** Moving off the geodesic increases the effective `V_Γ` through self-interaction with the wake. To maximize the action, the system's optimal strategy is to lower its internal frequency (`ω_k`), thereby preserving the highest possible T₀.
*   **Gravity (Temporal Pressure):** A high-Γ environment is, by definition, one with a high `V_Γ`. Again, the most efficient way for a system to maximize the Lagrangian and maintain its existence is to lower `ω_k`, adopting a slower, more stable rhythm.

Relativity is thus re-contextualized: it is the study of the universe's resonant-engineering solutions to the problem of maintaining coherence under stress.
