summary: "Provides the next layer of precision for the framework's g-2 calculation. This module models the third-order self-interaction of a lepton as a 'resonant leak' in the second-order 'self-damping' field. It derives the geometric coefficient for the O(α³) term, demonstrating the framework's ability to generate a full perturbative series that asymptotically approaches experimental reality."
