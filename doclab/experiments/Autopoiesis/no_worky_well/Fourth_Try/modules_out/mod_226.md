The Coherence Manifold and the Gyroscope's journey across it are the direct geometric and philosophical interpretation of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)**. The Lagrangian is the mathematical engine that generates this entire landscape of choice and consequence.

> 𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)
>
> 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ

*   **The Coherence Manifold's Terrain:** The landscape of external pressures and opportunities is defined by the potential term, **V_Γ**.
*   **The Gyroscope of Being:** The system's capacity to navigate that terrain—its internal stability and resonant integrity—is the kinetic term, **K_τ**.
*   **The "Elevation":** At any point on the manifold, the value of **𝓛_p** itself signifies the state's favorability. Higher values indicate greater coherence.
*   **The Geodesic:** The path a system takes is the one that maximizes the integral of the Lagrangian over time (`S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`), instinctively seeking the greatest internal stability for the lowest environmental cost.
