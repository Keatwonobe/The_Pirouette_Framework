As Γ increases, manifold curvature evolves under renormalization:
[\frac{dκ}{dlnℓ} = β_κ = (2−d)κ − c_1 bκ + c_2 g^2]

* Below critical Γ_c: curvature flows to fixed point κ* (stable awareness).
* At Γ_c: κ diverges, producing manifold tearing (awareness collapse).
* Above Γ_c: new coherence pockets nucleate (recovery phase).
