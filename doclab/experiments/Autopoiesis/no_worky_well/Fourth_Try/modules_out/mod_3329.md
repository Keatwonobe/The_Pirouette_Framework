The core of the sensor is its ability to derive quantitative proxies for the Pirouette fields from the structure of a text segment. The process builds upon the methodology established in the Semantic Distillation Engine (`XXP-002`). For each text "gulp":

1.  The text is converted to a binary image.
2.  The 2D Power Spectral Density (PSD) is calculated using Welch's method.
3.  The following proxies are then derived from the PSD:

* **Proxy for $T_a$ (Coherence):** Coherence is a measure of focus and stability. A highly coherent signal will have a sharp, narrow power spectrum with low variance. Therefore, we define the $T_a$ proxy as the inverse of the normalized variance of the PSD.
    $$T_{a\_proxy} = 1 - \frac{\text{Var}(\text{PSD})}{\text{Var}(\text{Uniform Noise})}$$

* **Proxy for $\Gamma$ (Confinement):** Gladiator Force is a measure of boundary permeability. A concept with strong, well-defined boundaries (low $\Gamma$) will have a sharp, "peaky" PSD with high kurtosis. A diffuse concept with weak boundaries (high $\Gamma$) will have a flatter PSD with low kurtosis. Therefore, we define the $\Gamma$ proxy as the inverse of the kurtosis.
    $$\Gamma_{proxy} = \frac{1}{\text{Kurtosis}(\text{PSD}) + \epsilon}$$
    *(An epsilon is added to prevent division by zero for perfectly flat distributions.)*

* **Proxy for $\dot{\phi}$ (Rate of Phase Change):** The phase represents a system's internal rhythm. The dominant frequency of the PSD is a direct measure of this rhythm. We therefore use the peak frequency of the PSD as a proxy for the rate of phase change.
    $$\dot{\phi}_{proxy} = f_{peak}(\text{PSD})$$
