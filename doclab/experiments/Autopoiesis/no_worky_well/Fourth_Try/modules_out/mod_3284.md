This map is the signature of a **focused historical record**. Notice how nearly all paths converge on the same central region.

* **All Paths Lead to the Archive:** "Power," "freedom," and "wisdom" are all inexorably pulled into the dense gravitational cluster defined by "**register**," "**genealogical**," "**dissertation**," and "**diary**."
* **Interpretation:** In the context of Henry Knox, a figure known more to historians than to the public, the very meaning of these grand concepts is secondary to the evidence that defines him. His power, his freedom, his wisdomâ€”all are interpreted *through the lens of the historical record*. The document's gravity is that of the archive; it asserts that truth is found in the primary sources.

**Conclusion:** The Henry Knox document creates a universe governed by evidence. The "pull" is not toward abstract ideals, but toward the concrete proof of the historical archive.
