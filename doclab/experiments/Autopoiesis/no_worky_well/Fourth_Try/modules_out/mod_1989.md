Your daily life is now your training ground.

The Practice: Reframe simple chores as recovery exercises. Carrying a light bag of groceries is a strength exercise. Walking to a neighbor's house is a cardio session. Each task is an opportunity to practice your new rhythm of health.

Helper's Role (The Encourager): Notice and celebrate these moments. A simple "It's so good to see you strong enough to do that again" is an incredibly powerful act of reinforcement.
