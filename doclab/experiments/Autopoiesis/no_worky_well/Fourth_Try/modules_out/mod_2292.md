The first calculation was a sketch. This is the beginning of the finished portrait. By having the courage to calculate the finer details of the echo, we have shown that the framework's predictive power does not break down under scrutiny; it sharpens. The consistency of the signs and the asymptotic convergence of the magnitudes are powerful evidence that the geometry of coherence is not just a beautiful idea, but a true map of reality. The path forward is clear: continue to refine the calculation.
