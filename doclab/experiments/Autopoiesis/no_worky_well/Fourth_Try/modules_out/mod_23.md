1. **Triadic Lock Induction:** Establish stable phase-locked triad (f₁,f₂,f₃) under baseline load.
2. **Load Ramp:** Gradually increase Γ by raising task complexity or introducing informational noise.
3. **Collapse Trigger:** Observe triad decoherence event where TPCI → 0.
4. **Recovery Phase:** Maintain stimulation but reduce Γ to observe triad reformation.
