The electric field (E) is the mathematical representation of this coherence landscape. For a static charge, the electric field is directly proportional to the gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian in the surrounding space.

E ∝ ∇𝓛_p
 
A test charge placed in this field doesn't feel a "push" or "pull." It senses a slope in the coherence manifold. The "force" it experiences is simply the consequence of it following the steepest path towards its own state of maximal coherence. It is "coherence surfing" down the gradient established by the source charge.
