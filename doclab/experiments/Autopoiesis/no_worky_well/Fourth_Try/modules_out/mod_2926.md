The will is not a switch to be flipped but a mountain to be weathered. True control over another being cannot be achieved with a single spell but must be won through a grueling battle of entropic attrition.

The Process: The attacker targets a victim's mental attributes (Intelligence or Wisdom). To "damage" these attributes, the attacker must spend 2 EP from their own pool for every 1 point of EP they wish to remove from the target's invested attribute pool. This represents the immense inefficiency of imposing one's will upon another.

The Battle: This is a contested process. The target can use their Active Defense (spending their own EP) to resist the mental intrusion on a 1-to-1 basis. This creates a drawn-out struggle where the attacker tries to drain the defender's mental reserves.

The Goal: The attacker's goal is to reduce the target's Intelligence Score or Wisdom Score to 0, at which point the victim falls under their control as per the Coherence Threshold rule (TLE-013). This makes mind-controlling a "steely-minded warrior" a monumental undertaking, as it should be.
