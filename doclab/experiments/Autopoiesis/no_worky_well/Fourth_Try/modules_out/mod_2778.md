This is a direct assault on an entity's Intelligence score.

Mechanic: The attacker makes a contested roll of their (d20 + INT Mod + WIS Mod) against the target's (d20 + INT Mod + WIS Mod). If the attacker wins, they temporarily reduce the target's Intelligence Score by the difference.

The Handicap: For each point the target's Intelligence Score is pushed into the negative, they suffer an "entropy handicap." Any action they attempt that is not permitted by the controller costs an additional EP equal to their negative Intelligence Score.

Full Control: If the handicap becomes greater than the target's Entropy Regeneration Rate, they are effectively puppeted by the controller, who can now spend their own Actions to command the target.

Caster Cost: EP spent to maintain a mind control effect is locked and cannot be regenerated until the effect is released.
