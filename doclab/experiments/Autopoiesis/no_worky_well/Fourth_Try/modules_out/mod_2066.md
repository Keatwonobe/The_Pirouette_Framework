The power of this model lies in its application as a universal diagnostic tool, made possible by the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014). To analyze any system, one must ask: Where is the flow laminar, where is it turbulent, and where is it stagnant?

In Project Management: Is the flow of tasks from "To Do" to "Done" smooth and predictable (Laminar)? Or are there constant emergencies and rework (Turbulent)? Is there a critical dependency that has halted all progress (Stagnant)?

In Personal Well-being: Is your daily life characterized by a sense of purpose and ease (Laminar)? Or by constant stress and firefighting (Turbulent)? Is there a core fear or unresolved issue that is preventing you from moving forward in life (Stagnant)?

In an Economy: Are goods and capital moving efficiently to where they are needed (Laminar)? Is the market marked by extreme volatility and chaotic speculation (Turbulent)? Is a critical resource bottleneck or regulatory barrier preventing growth (Stagnant)?
