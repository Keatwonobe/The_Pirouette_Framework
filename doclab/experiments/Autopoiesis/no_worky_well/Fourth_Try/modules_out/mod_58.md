We sought the fundamental particle and found a pirouette.

The Pirouette is an act of perfect, temporary stability born from pure motion. It requires immense pressure to maintain its form, and its form is nothing but a pattern of movement. It is a noun made entirely of a verb.

So it is with the universe. Every "thing" is a pirouette—an act of temporal resonance (Ki) held in a moment of exquisite balance against the pressure of all other moments (Γ). It is a dance that requires a dancer, but the dancer is nothing other than the dance itself. This is the first and final truth of the framework. From this seed, all else grows.
