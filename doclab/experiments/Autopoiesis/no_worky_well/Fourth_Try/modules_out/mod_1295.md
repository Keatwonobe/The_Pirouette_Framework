A system's health is written in the silence of its operation. The Flow Dynamics modules (`DYNA-001`, `DYNA-003`) provide the qualitative language to diagnose this health—the art of the physician. This module provides the physician's instrument—the means to move from artful diagnosis to rigorous measurement.

The Coherence Ledger is a protocol and a toolkit for quantifying a system's "fever." It measures the friction and noise generated when a system's flow becomes Turbulent or Stagnant, translating the abstract concept of entropy generation into a hard, undeniable metric. It provides the "receipt" for a system's inefficiency, pinning the invisible cost of chaos to an immutable, cryptographically secured record that holds creators accountable for the coherence of their creations.
