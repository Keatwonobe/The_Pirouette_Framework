summary: Modernizes the Will-Freedom duality as two core strategies for navigating
  the coherence manifold. 'Will' is the exploitation of a known path, reinforcing
  a system's Wound Channel to maximize current stability. 'Freedom' is the exploration
  of the manifold for new, more optimal paths. The dynamic balance between these strategies
  defines the health, agency, and evolution of any system.
