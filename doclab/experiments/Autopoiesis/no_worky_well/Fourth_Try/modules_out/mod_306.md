The response, or **Echo**, is how another entity's system interacts with the new geometry of the Current. This is not a passive reception of information, but an active, physical navigation. The response is governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006): the entity will behave in a way that maximizes its own internal stability. The Current has just changed the cost function of its environment.

This change is felt through the listener's **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`). The singer's Current directly alters the potential energy term (`V_Γ`) for the listener. A persuasive Current is an invitation; it sculpts the listener's reality so that the proposed path becomes their new path of least resistance—a state of higher potential coherence.
