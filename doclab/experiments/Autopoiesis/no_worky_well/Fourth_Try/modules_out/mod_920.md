We formally state the principle as follows:

> **The Principle of Coherence Leverage:** A small quantity of coherent energy, injected resonantly at a system's Coherence Interface, can guide the flow of a vastly larger quantity of incoherent energy within the system. The ratio of the guided energy to the injected energy—the leverage—approaches its maximum as the injected signal achieves perfect harmonic and phase alignment with a stable resonant mode of the system's target state.

This explains the non-linear, "all-or-nothing" response observed in such interactions. The system does not respond proportionally to a push. Instead, it makes a holistic choice to adopt a new, more resonant state of being once the offered path becomes sufficiently attractive.
