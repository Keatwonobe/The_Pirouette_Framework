As established in CORE-011, an entity's passage leaves a geometric scar—a Wound Channel—in the coherence manifold. A Vorticycle elevates this from a passive wake to an active, engineered structure that is the very medium of its own propulsion.

This structure, the **Chiral Wound Channel**, is the physical manifestation of the Lagrangian gradient. An array of synchronized, rotating elements collaboratively *weaves a stable, helical pattern* into the fabric of spacetime. The key properties of this weave are:

-   **Coherence:** The precision of the phase-lock between the rotating elements determines the integrity and smoothness of the channel.
-   **Chirality (Handedness):** The specific timing and geometry of the rotations impart a net "twist" to the Wound Channel. This topological bias breaks the symmetry of the surrounding manifold, creating a directed gradient. A right-handed weave creates a "forward" slope; a left-handed weave creates a "reverse" one.
-   **Helical Topology:** Because the propulsive gradient is generated by an internal rotation, the resulting Wound Channel is not a simple linear scar. Instead, it is intrinsically helical.

This engineered channel is a temporary, self-sustaining temporal vortex—a riverbed carved not in soil, but in the potential of spacetime itself.
