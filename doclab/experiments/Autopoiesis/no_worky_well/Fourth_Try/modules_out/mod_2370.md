summary: "Defines Ki as the fundamental resonance constant emerging from the spiral-extended
  Lagrangian, unifying its empirical dual values (π+1 and 4π/3) through topological
  state transitions. Introduces the tether–snap dynamics that govern chemical and
  mechanical “ticks”—the discrete leaps between coherence topologies."
