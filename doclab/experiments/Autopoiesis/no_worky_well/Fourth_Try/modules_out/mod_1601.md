The universe is an artist of profound efficiency. When a complex form is no longer the most elegant solution to its environment, it does not discard its complexity; it translates it. This module describes a fundamental process of such a translation, previously termed a dimensional collapse, now understood as a dimensional unfolding.

This phenomenon is a phase transition driven by the relentless search for maximal coherence. It occurs when a system in a low-pressure environment (`Γ`) finds a more efficient path to stability. It trades a complex, static, multi-polar symmetry for a simpler, bipolar form that expresses the "lost" dimension's information as a stable, coherent temporal oscillation. This is not a loss of information, but its reconfiguration—the transformation of a silent sculpture into a resonant melody.
