An entity is a coherent pattern of will, but some experiences—a divine blessing, a vile curse, a profound trauma—are so powerful they can permanently alter that pattern. They become a resonant scar, a Wound Channel that does not just weaken the soul but actively rewrites it under specific conditions. This module provides the framework for these transformative states, allowing for the creation of classic archetypes like werewolves, vampires, and demigods using the core physics of the system.
