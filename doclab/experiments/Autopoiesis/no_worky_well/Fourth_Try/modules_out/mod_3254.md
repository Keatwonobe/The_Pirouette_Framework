1.  **Draft a New `PPS-035 v2.0`:** This new module will state the correspondence principle explicitly.
    * **The New Axiom:** "The Gladiator Force (Γ) is a fundamental scalar field governing confinement at all scales. Newton's Gravitational Constant (G) is the effective, low-energy, macroscopic value of Γ as determined by the confinement of baryonic matter."
    * **The Scaling Law:** The module will focus on the scaling law (`Γ(M) ∝ M⁻ˣ`) as the key dynamic, showing how the same field can produce both strong force-like confinement at the quark scale and gravity at the stellar scale.
