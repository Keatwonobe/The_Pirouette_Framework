1.  **Select Corpus:** Use a large, well-defined corpus of scientific papers, such as the arXiv preprint server for a specific field (e.g., astrophysics).
2.  **Map the "Need" Field:**
    * Apply **Reverse Pareto Analysis (`TEN-RPA-1.0`)** to the entire corpus, analyzing citation networks and keyword frequencies. The analysis will identify the "vital few" papers or concepts that are cited disproportionately.
    * The hypothesis is that these highly cited papers represent the resolution to high-pressure "needs" in the scientific community at the time they were published. We will quantify this "need pressure" by measuring the rate and density of publications on a topic *before* the influential paper was released.
3.  **Map the "Semantic Gravity" Field:**
    * For the same corpus, use the **Semantic Distillation Engine (`TEN-SDE-1.0`)** to calculate the `velcridance_score` (as a proxy for Î“) for each paper's abstract. This score represents the paper's conceptual rigidity and informational density.
4.  **Correlate the Fields:**
    * The final step is to correlate the two independently derived metrics.
    * **Prediction:** According to the new axiom, there should be a strong positive correlation between a paper's "need pressure" (the problem it solved) and its `velcridance_score` (its semantic gravity).
