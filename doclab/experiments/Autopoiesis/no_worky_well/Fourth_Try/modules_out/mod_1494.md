summary: Provides the meta-protocol for applying the CORE principles to any specific
  domain. It establishes the Principle of Correspondence, showing that universal dynamics
  are expressed through domain-specific variables. This module is the 'user's manual'
  for the framework, enabling the analysis and prediction of system behavior at any
  scale.
