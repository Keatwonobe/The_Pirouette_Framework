summary: Presents a compendium of cross-domain evidence validating the Pirouette Framework.
  It demonstrates how the universal drive to maximize coherence, governed by the Pirouette
  Lagrangian, manifests as consistent, fractal resonance patterns in systems ranging
  from geophysics and biology to economics and artificial intelligence, re-framing
  consilience as the core principle of empirical validation.
