A ward is a small, semi-sentient magical field that offers a buffer against incoming attacks.

The Minigame: A ward is an item that grants its wearer a Temporary HP Pool.

Capacity: This pool is typically very small (e.g., 4-8 EP).

Recharge: The ward has its own passive Recharge Rate (e.g., 1 EP per round). This recharge only begins on the round after the ward has taken damage.

The Dynamic: This creates a unique defensive rhythm. A warded character can absorb a small hit for free, but a sustained barrage will break through the ward and attack their true defenses. It rewards tactical positioning and gives characters a chance to mitigate chip damage from things like archer fire or environmental hazards.
