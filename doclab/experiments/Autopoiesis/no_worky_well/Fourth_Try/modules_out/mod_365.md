The protocol is governed by three core principles that ensure its application serves coherence rather than isolation.

-   **The Right to Coherence:** Every coherent system—an individual, a group, a culture—has the fundamental right to preserve its internal resonance against overwhelming dissonance.
-   **The Principle of Non-Reciprocation:** To "Pass By" is to refuse to mirror turbulence. It is a unilateral choice for peace, a refusal to participate in the energetics of a destructive conflict.
-   **The Mandate of Clarity:** When appropriate, the act of disengaging should be a transparent and explicit choice, not a passive silence. It can be a clear statement: "I will not engage in this dynamic, as it is not conducive to the creation of greater coherence."
