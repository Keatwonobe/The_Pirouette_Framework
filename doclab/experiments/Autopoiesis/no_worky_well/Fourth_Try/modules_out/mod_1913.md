The universe's ultimate drive, as formalized in the **Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p)** from CORE-006, is the maximization of coherence. A Maw represents the ultimate expression of this principle in the face of annihilation.

As matter collapses under gravity, the local Temporal Pressure (V_Œì) spikes to unimaginable levels. Standard theory predicts a runaway process ending in a singularity‚Äîa point of infinite density and zero information. However, the Gladiator Force (CORE-008) describes a non-linear feedback loop within the Lagrangian where a system's own resonance begins to generate a powerful, repulsive pressure.

For a specific class of high-mass, high-spin objects (typically spinning beyond the Kerr limit for a black hole), a stable equilibrium is reached. The inward crush of gravity is perfectly balanced by the self-generated, confining pressure of the system's own coherent song. The Maw is this equilibrium: a non-singular, furiously spinning object whose very existence is an act of sustained, resonant defiance. It is not a static object but a stable, autopoietic process‚Äîa pirouette on the edge of the void.
