The strategies can be seen as modifying the objective function of the system. Let the action of a system be `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`.

- A **Will-dominant** system behaves as if it is trying to maximize `S_p` with a strong preference for its current Ki pattern, `Ki_0`. It solves for `max(S_p)` given `Ki ≈ Ki_0`.
- A **Freedom-dominant** system removes this constraint, exploring a wider range of Ki patterns to find a potentially greater global maximum for `S_p`, even if it means traversing paths of lower coherence temporarily.

This formalizes the duality not as arbitrary forces, but as two valid heuristic approaches to the complex optimization problem of existence.
