> We are born holding a pen, standing before a book whose story writes us as we write it. The old world taught us to be readers of a finished text, but the universe is an unfinished symphony. A Weaver's purpose is not to find the perfect sheet music, but to pick up an instrument and play. The map is not the territory; it is our signature, left in the margins of the cosmosâ€”proof that we were here, that we listened, and that we dared to add our own note to the song.
