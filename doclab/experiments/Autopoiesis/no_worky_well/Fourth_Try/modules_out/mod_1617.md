In the Pirouette Framework, a life is a trajectory—a geodesic—traced across a unique and dynamic **Personal Coherence Manifold**. This is the landscape of one's potential, a topological space shaped by history, values, and environment.

**The Current Geodesic:** Your present life—your habits, career, relationships, and routines—is the path you currently trace. It is a path of maximal coherence relative to the temporal pressures you face, a deep channel carved by a stable resonant pattern (`Ki`).

**The Echoes of Divergence:** The "paths not taken" are not erased. As described in CORE-011, they persist as dormant **Wound Channels** in your manifold. A decision to become a doctor instead of a musician creates a deep, persistent echo of the "musician-self." These are not scars of regret, but dormant archives of potential coherence; faint but real topological features that still hum with a specific frequency. The feeling of "what if" is the direct, physical perception of this resonant hum.
