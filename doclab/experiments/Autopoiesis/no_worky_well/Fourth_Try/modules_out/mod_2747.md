An entity's health and durability are direct measures of their coherent integrity.

The Health Pool: An entity's Hit Points (HP) are not an abstract score but are derived directly from the EP invested in their physical form.

Max HP = (EP in Torso) + (0.5 * Total EP in all Limbs, rounded down)

Armor & Shields as Entropic Pools: Armor and shields are not passive defenses. They possess their own Armor Entropy Pool (AEP). When an entity with armor takes damage, the damage is first subtracted from the armor's AEP. Any remaining damage is applied to the entity's Health Pool. This makes armor a destructible, repairable resource.
