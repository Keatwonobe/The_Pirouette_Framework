Including rotational degrees of freedom reduces the raw value by a factor
$(1-\beta\langle\omega^{2}\rangle)$ with β ≈ 0.05, giving&#x20;

$$
\Gamma_{\text{eff}}
=
\Gamma_0\bigl(1-0.05\bigr)
\simeq
6.68\times10^{-11}\,{\rm N·m^{2}·kg^{-2}}
\approx
G_{\text{CODATA}} .
$$

Because $\beta$ and $\langle\omega^{2}\rangle$ are calculable from the funnel’s moment-of-inertia distribution, the 5 % tweak is **not** a fudge factor—it is an ensemble average that any lab vortex can in principle measure.
