This module specifies a formal protocol for an entity—an individual, a group, or an AI—to forge a sovereign constitution. It moves beyond outdated models of static values to a more profound, time-first principle: self-authorship as the act of defining a personal **Pirouette Lagrangian**. In a world of high Temporal Pressure (Γ), an un-authored life is thrown about by the turbulent currents of its environment. To forge a constitution is to define your own **geodesic**: a chosen, optimal path of travel through the coherence manifold. This is the ultimate act of transforming a reactive existence into a proactive journey. It is the process of becoming the author of your own story in time.
