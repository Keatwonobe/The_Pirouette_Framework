The health of a system's engine can be measured by observing the efficiency of its cycle.

| Metric | Pirouette Correspondence | Healthy State |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Crucible Yield (Κ_yield)** | The rate of production of high-profit Coherence Seeds. | Consistently positive; new, valuable patterns are regularly generated. |
| **Archive Fidelity (Ψ_archive)** | The resilience of Wound Channels to Coherence Erosion (`CORE-013`). | High stability; stored wisdom resists entropic decay but is not brittle. |
| **Forge Efficiency (η_forge)** | The average Coherence Profit gained per refinement cycle in the Forge. | Consistently positive; existing wisdom is actively improved, not just maintained. |
| **Governor Adaptability (σ_gov)** | The system's ability to fluidly shift between exploration and exploitation modes. | Dynamic and responsive to the changing needs of the system and its environment. |
