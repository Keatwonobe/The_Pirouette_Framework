The aftermath of a spasm is not preordained. The system, having been unmade, can be remade in one of three ways.

1.  **Restorative:** The turbulent flow successfully cleared the blockage, but the fundamental landscape of the system remains unchanged. The river returns to its old, stagnant channel, rebuilding the dam. The crisis is over, but no deep learning has occurred. The pressure begins to build again.
2.  **Transformative:** The sheer force of the turbulent release was so great that it carved a new, more efficient riverbed. The system coalesces into a novel state of **Laminar Flow** that is more resilient, complex, or elegant than before. This is a higher order forged in the crucible of chaos.
3.  **Degenerative:** The violence of the fracture was too great. The system's foundational structures—its **Wound Channel**—were irrevocably damaged. It fails to find a new stable state, remaining in a condition of chronic Turbulence or collapsing into constituent parts. The dam is broken, but so is the river.
