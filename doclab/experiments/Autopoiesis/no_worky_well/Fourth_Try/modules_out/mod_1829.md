The power of the Resonance Gauge lies in its diagnostic interpretation. The resulting Coherence Index places the system on a spectrum of health and systemic integrity.

-   **Coherence Index ≈ 1 (Laminar Coherence):** The system is in a state of grace. Its components act in unison, its energy transfer is efficient, and its form is stable. This is the signature of health and order. Examples: a crystal lattice, a person in a deep flow state, a well-run organization.
-   **0 < Coherence Index < 1 (Turbulent Coherence):** The system is in a state of struggle, beset by internal friction and external pressure. Energy is being wasted, and its pattern is noisy and inefficient. This is the signature of stress and chaos. Examples: a turbulent fluid, a society in civil conflict, a mind consumed by anxiety.
-   **Coherence Index ≈ 0 (Coherence Collapse):** The system has lost its identity. Its components are in complete disarray, and no coherent pattern can be discerned. It is dissolving back into the undifferentiated noise of the background Γ. This is the signature of systemic failure or death.
