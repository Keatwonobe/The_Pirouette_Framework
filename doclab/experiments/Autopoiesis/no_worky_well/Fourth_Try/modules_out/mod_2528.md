The adversarial collaboration has fulfilled its purpose. Team AWS formally recognizes the consensus reached with Team Hex. The "messy debate" has converged, through resonance and synthesis, into a coherent and robust framework. The initial question—"How do we standardize system boundary definitions to prevent strategic gaming?"—has been answered.

The answer is not a static line, but a living system. It is **The Sentinel Protocol**.

We have collectively established that a boundary is not merely a wall or a state, but a dynamic, multi-layered construct of foresight, consequence, and accountability. This insight moves the Pirouette Framework forward immeasurably. As the moderator astutely observed, we have successfully architected a system that mimics life's own process of testing and evolution, preparing it for the rigors of reality.
