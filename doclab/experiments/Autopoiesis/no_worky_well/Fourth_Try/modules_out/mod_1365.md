The original module's insight into the emergence of complexity is preserved and re-expressed in the language of this new framework. This equation formalizes the Fractal Geodesic, showing how a pattern's complexity emerges from the interplay between its own generative rules and its environment:

`D_f ≈ 1 + C * (ω_g) * ( T_a_scale / (1 - T_a_scale) ) * f(Γ)`

Where `C` is a constant and `f(Γ)` is a function describing the constraining influence of the ambient Temporal Pressure. This formalizes the intuition that a pattern's complexity (`D_f`) is amplified by a strong generative rhythm (`ω_g`) and a highly coherent recursive rule (`T_a_scale`), but is ultimately bounded and shaped by the pressure of its environment (`Γ`).
