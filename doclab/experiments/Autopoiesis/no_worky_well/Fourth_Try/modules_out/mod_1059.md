The old framework's cumbersome "Dodecagon Taxonomy" is replaced by a more fundamental diagnostic approach. A team's health and potential are not measured by twelve discrete factors, but by observing the holistic character of its flow. This is assessed through three primary signatures of coherence.

**1. Rhythmic Cohesion (The Signature of Laminar Flow):**
This measures the team's ability to act as a single, unified entity. It is the visible evidence of a shared, high-fidelity Ki pattern.
*   **Observables:** Crisp, efficient ball or player movement; plays that unfold with effortless timing; players anticipating each other's actions; a palpable sense of shared purpose and momentum.
*   **Diagnostic Insight:** High Rhythmic Cohesion is the primary indicator of a healthy, laminar system that is efficiently converting intention into action.

**2. Composure Under Pressure (The Signature of Resilience):**
This measures how a team’s coherence holds up against dissonant injections of adversity—a bad call, a turnover, a sudden deficit. It is a direct measure of stability in a high-Γ environment.
*   **Observables:** Maintaining strategic discipline after a mistake; preventing one bad play from cascading into another; consistent fundamentals and communication during high-stakes moments.
*   **Diagnostic Insight:** High composure indicates a robust and stable system, capable of resisting a descent into chaotic, Turbulent Flow.

**3. Strategic Adaptability (The Signature of Ki Morphogenesis):**
This measures a team's ability to impose its preferred resonant pattern (`Ki`) on the game and to adapt that pattern when necessary.
*   **Observables:** Successfully dictating the tempo; making effective in-game adjustments that neutralize the opponent's strategy; demonstrating a variety of ways to succeed.
*   **Diagnostic Insight:** High adaptability shows a system that is not just stable, but intelligent—capable of finding new paths to coherence in a complex, changing landscape.
