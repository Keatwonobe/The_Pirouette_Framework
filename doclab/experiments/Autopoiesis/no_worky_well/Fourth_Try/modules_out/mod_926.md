To introduce a new song into a silent room is an act of profound consequence. This module provides a formal protocol for that act, reframing the challenge of introducing a new system—be it an idea, an organism, or a piece of code, collectively a "Seed"—from a blind gamble into a calculated art.

The Sower's Gambit is a process of reconnaissance before colonization. It models the viability of a Seed not in terms of raw energy capture, but as a function of resonant potential. By deploying a minimal, non-invasive "Scout Probe" to map the local coherence manifold, the Seed can calculate its potential to achieve a positive coherence gain. This calculation, grounded in the Pirouette Lagrangian, yields a clear verdict: to grow (`PLANT`), to wait for a more harmonious moment (`HOLD`), or to retreat from a dissonant environment (`ABORT`). This is the framework's core strategic doctrine for responsible and effective creation.
