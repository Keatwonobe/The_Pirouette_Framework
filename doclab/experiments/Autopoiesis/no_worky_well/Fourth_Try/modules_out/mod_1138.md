A particle is not a thing, but a stable, self-perpetuating rhythm—a topological knot of coherence (`Ki`). Its passage through spacetime carves a persistent geometric scar, a **Wound Channel** (CORE-011), into the local coherence manifold. An antiparticle is its perfect topological mirror. Its `Ki` pattern is phase-conjugate, and its Wound Channel is a mirror-image scar—a groove for the other's ridge.

When brought together, these are not two separate entities meeting, but a single geometric proposition and its negation. Their forms are designed to fit together with the seamless, obliterating precision of a lock and its key. The event is the physical act of these two geometries meeting and mutually erasing one another, returning the manifold to a smooth, unscarred state.
