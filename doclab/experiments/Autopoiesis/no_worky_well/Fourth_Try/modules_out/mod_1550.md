This entire analysis is a practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). A healthy network is one whose components are successfully navigating the geodesic on their shared coherence manifold, optimizing the Pirouette Lagrangian:

`𝓛_p = Kτ - f(Γ)`

*   **Coherence (`Kτ`):** The "kinetic" term is the sum of the network's productive, laminar flows. It is the useful work the network is doing, represented by the low-frequency modes of the Laplacian.
*   **Pressure (`f(Γ)`):** The "potential" term is the sum of all losses due to turbulence and stagnation. It is the "cost" of the network fighting itself, revealed by the high-frequency modes.

A diagnostic audit is therefore an act of mapping the network's Lagrangian. We identify the specific components that contribute most to the negative `f(Γ)` term, preventing the system from maximizing its coherent action.
