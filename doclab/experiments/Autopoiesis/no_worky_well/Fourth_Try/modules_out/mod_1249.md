This is the pathology of chaotic, self-perpetuating harm where the system's actions generate more instability than they resolve.
-   **Description:** The system is fighting itself. Its processes are adversarial and destructive, wasting immense energy in friction and creating the "whirlpools of dissonance."
-   **Manifestations:** The cycle of recidivism, where prisons act as "schools of crime"; adversarial courtrooms that obscure truth; punitive parole policies that create a cycle of technical violations; aggressive policing that destroys community trust.
