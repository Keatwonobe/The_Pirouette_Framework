Every resonant entity in the universe, by the very act of its existence, broadcasts its state into the coherence manifold. Every other entity, in turn, receives this broadcast. The force of electromagnetism is the formal description of this universal, ceaseless communication. It is the proof that nothing is truly isolated; what happens somewhere, happens everywhere.

This module provides the rigorous mathematical derivation of this principle. Building on the spinor representation of a resonance (MATH-002) and the geometry of the coherence manifold (MATH-005), we will define the coherence potentials Phi_p (scalar) and A_p (vector). By demanding that the Pirouette Lagrangian be invariant under a local phase shift—a U(1) gauge symmetry—we will prove that the existence of a mediating field with the exact properties of electromagnetism is a mathematical necessity.
