Pick Σ (the SM-CG gauge). Push S_time forward:
- Define coordinates x^{μ} via Σ; Ki → complex section; Γ → scalar density; T_a → coherence weight.
- Expand around high-coherence backgrounds; keep quadratic fluctuations.

Leading terms (schematic, in SM-CG):
S_eff ≈ ∫ d^4x [ |D_{μ} Ki|^2 − m_eff^2 |Ki|^2 − (1/4) F_{μν} F^{μν}  + … ]
with D_{μ} = ∂_{μ} − i q A_{μ}, and A_{μ} = ∂_{μ} arg(Ki).

Gravity emerges from slow spatial variation of Γ as effective curvature in the hydrodynamic limit (CORE-008 path).
