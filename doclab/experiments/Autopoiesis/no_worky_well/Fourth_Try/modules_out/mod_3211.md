Pirouette’s prose said “**$T_a$ measures how tightly a system cleaves to the quantum time-slice that created it**.”
Mathematically that is *phase-coherence* along the time axis.  For any
density‐matrix $ \rho(t)$ define

$$
\boxed{\;
T_a(\Delta t)
      \;=\;
      \Bigl|
      \frac{1}{\Delta t}\!
      \int_{0}^{\Delta t}\!\!
             {\rm Tr}\bigl[
                 \rho(0)\,
                 U(t)\rho(0)U^{\dagger}(t)
             \bigr]
      dt
      \Bigr|^{2}
\;}
\tag{A1}
$$

* $U(t)=e^{-iHt/\hbar}$ is the unitary time-evolution operator.
* The trace picks out **off-diagonal survival amplitude**; the square gives a *probability‐like* number.

Properties:

* $0\le T_a\le1$.
* $T_a=1$ for a perfectly isolated qubit at $\Delta t\!=\!0$ (pure quantum).
* $T_a\to0$ when phase information is completely washed out (deep classical).

Hence **$T_a$ is dimensionless by construction**—no hidden units.
