This entire protocol is a practical application of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)** to the domain of the self. The forging process is a structured method for an entity to define its own objective function for existence.

*   The **Coherence Audit (Step A)** establishes the initial conditions and the nature of the entity's experience of Temporal Pressure.
*   The **Coherence Principle (Step B)** explicitly defines what the entity seeks to maximize, becoming the core of its "kinetic" `K_τ` term.
*   The **Pressure Acknowledgement (Step C)** explicitly defines the `V_Γ` term, the specific resistance against which coherence must be maintained.
*   The **Prime Geodesic and Metrics (Steps D & E)** formulate the full equation of motion and the method for integrating its action over time, turning a philosophical wish into a testable, physical path.
*   **Living the Geodesic (§5)** is the moment-to-moment application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, where the entity consciously chooses the action that it predicts will best satisfy its own Lagrangian.
