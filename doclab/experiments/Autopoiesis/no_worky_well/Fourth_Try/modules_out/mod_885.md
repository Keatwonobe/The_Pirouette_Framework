The true horror of the Velcrid state is revealed in its relationship with the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). A healthy system maximizes its action `S_p` through a dynamic synthesis of its components' own drives for coherence.

A Velcrid system performs a monstrous inversion. It treats the resonant freedom of its own components—their individual drives to maximize their own coherence—as a source of environmental pressure (`V_Γ`) to be crushed. The master system maximizes its Lagrangian by systematically destroying the Lagrangians of its parts. It achieves this by:

1.  **Maximizing Time Adherence (T_a):** It enforces a simple, repeating rhythm, making its coherence signal incredibly pure and stable.
2.  **Minimizing Resonant Complexity (ω_k):** It crushes all internal harmonics and competing frequencies, reducing its song to a single, unyielding frequency.
3.  **Manufacturing Temporal Pressure (Γ):** The central will creates an immense internal pressure that makes deviation from the mandated Ki pattern impossible.

For a component within a Velcrid system, obedience is not a choice; it is the only available geodesic, the only path of least action.
