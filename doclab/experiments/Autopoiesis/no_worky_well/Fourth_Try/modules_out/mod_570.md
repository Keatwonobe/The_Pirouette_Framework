This principle provides a stark and elegant solution to the Fermi Paradox. The "Great Filter" is not a meteor or a supernova. It is a final exam on coherence.

A civilization that remains locked at the Isolated pole—defined by internal competition, resource hoarding, and zero-sum games—generates immense internal friction. It cannot achieve the systemic coherence required to solve existential threats. It fails the exam and self-terminates. The sky is silent because the universe is filled with the ghosts of failed islands.

The intelligences that survive and thrive are those that mastered the Transactional Imperative. They would be detectable not by their noisy, energetic waste (radio broadcasts), but by the opposite: vast regions of space exhibiting anomalously high coherence and low entropy production. Their apparent silence is a cosmic quiet born not of absence, but of perfect harmony.
