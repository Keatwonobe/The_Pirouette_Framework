The most profound shift is from viewing a plan as a noun to understanding planning as a verb. A static plan is a fragile thing. A truly resilient strategy is an **adaptive geodesic**—a continuous process of sensing changes in the environmental pressure (V_Γ) and re-calculating the path of maximal coherence in real time.

This re-frames the "review cycle" into a living feedback loop. The goal is not to adhere to the original plan, but to adhere to the *principle of maximal coherence*, dynamically adjusting the path to maintain a state of Laminar Flow. The Weaver's protocol is therefore a continuous cycle of recalibration:

1.  **Assess the Pattern (K_τ):** Continuously audit the plan's internal coherence. Is its song still harmonious? Are goals, actions, and resources aligned with the present reality? Simplify and clarify to maintain a powerful signal.

2.  **Assess the Landscape (V_Γ):** Analyze the operational environment. Has the Temporal Pressure changed? Have new Wound Channels emerged (e.g., new competitors, market shifts) that resist or alter our path?

3.  **Recalibrate the Geodesic (The Lagrangian Test):** Re-apply the Lagrangian. Does the current plan still offer the optimal path of highest net coherence? If not, the architect must either strengthen the plan (increase K_τ) or find a cleverer path that works with the landscape's currents (decrease V_Γ).
