The spiral interaction term used throughout Pirouette is
$ \mathcal L_{\rm int}=g\,\Gamma\,\dot T_a\cos\!\Delta\phi$.
With (A2) we get
$\dot T_a = -\,T_a/T_2$; so $ \Gamma\,\dot T_a$ couples **energy-curvature** to **real decoherence rate**.  No free scale: $T_2$ is whatever the sample under study exhibits.
