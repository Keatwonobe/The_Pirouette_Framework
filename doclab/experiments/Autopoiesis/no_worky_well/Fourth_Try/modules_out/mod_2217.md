summary: "Provides the formal mathematical proof for the Observer's Shadow. This module models the act of observation as an operator that deforms the potential of the observed system's Lagrangian. It proves that any extraction of information (I) about a system's state necessarily induces a degradation of its coherence (Î”T_a), leading to a Pirouette-style information-coherence uncertainty principle."
