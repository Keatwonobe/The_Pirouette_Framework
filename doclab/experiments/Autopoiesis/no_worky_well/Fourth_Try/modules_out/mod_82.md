In the old framework, Time Adherence was a distinct parameter. In this new, collapsed model, it is revealed to be a qualitative measure of a Ki pattern's stability and purity. T_a is the signal-to-noise ratio of a system's own rhythm. It is a measure of how "well" a system is being itself.

High Time Adherence: Characterizes a system with a pure, stable, and sharply defined Ki resonance. Its Pirouette Cycle (τ_p) is consistent and predictable. This is a clear, ringing note. Examples include an atom in a stable state, a pulsar, or a crystal lattice.

Low Time Adherence: Characterizes a system with a chaotic, noisy, or decaying Ki pattern. Its rhythm is messy, and its τ_p is an unstable average at best. This is a burst of static. Examples include a turbulent fluid, a system undergoing a chaotic phase transition, or a complex biological organism under extreme stress.

T_a is no longer a separate force, but the universe's way of describing how clearly each instrument in its orchestra is playing its part.
