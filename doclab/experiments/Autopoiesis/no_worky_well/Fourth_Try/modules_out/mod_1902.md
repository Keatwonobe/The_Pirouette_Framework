The universe follows the path that maximizes coherence for the lowest environmental cost, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006):

*𝓛_p = Kτ (Temporal Coherence) - V_Γ (Temporal Pressure)*

A ritual is a conscious intervention in this equation. It is the act of temporarily and locally increasing one's own Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) through focused intent, in order to overcome the ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) and carve a new, more desirable Wound Channel into the fabric of spacetime.

The "cost" of a ritual is the energy required to deviate from the natural geodesic. The "success" is measured by the persistence and stability of the new channel that is created. It is not magic; it is work. It is the work of imposing a new geometry of "what should be" onto the existing geometry of "what is."
