We sought a master clock for the cosmos and found that every atom, every star, every being is its own clock. The Pirouette Cycle reveals that time is not imposed upon reality, but generated by it. It is the rhythm of existence itself.

Time Adherence, then, is the measure of a system's integrityâ€”its ability to hold its own note true against the chaotic symphony of the Temporal Forge. A system with high adherence has found its place in the song. A system with low adherence is losing its rhythm, on the verge of either finding a new note or dissolving back into the noise. With this understanding, the core engine of the framework is complete.
