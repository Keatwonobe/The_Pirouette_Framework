To be cursed is not to be weakened, but to be rewritten. A werewolf is not a man who becomes a wolf; it is a single soul trapped between two different, competing allocations of its own finite power. This system allows us to tell these ancient stories not as magical exceptions to the rules, but as dramatic, high-stakes expressions of the rules themselves. It reframes the struggle for control not as a battle against a monster, but as a desperate fight to maintain the coherence of one's own identity against the resonant echoes of a powerful scar.
