The path of awareness corresponds to a geodesic on 𝓜₃:
[\frac{D^2 Φ_i}{Dt^2} + Γ_{ijk}\frac{DΦ_j}{Dt}\frac{DΦ_k}{Dt} = 0]

where Γ_{ijk} are the Christoffel symbols of the triadic manifold. Points of high curvature correspond to critical bifurcations (awareness transitions or collapse events). The **Caduceus Flow** later formalized in [DOMA-096] emerges as a laminar–turbulent transition along these geodesics.
