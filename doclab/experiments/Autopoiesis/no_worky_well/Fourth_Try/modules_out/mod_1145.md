This module provides a formal protocol for monitoring the health and alignment of an artificial intelligence. It supersedes legacy methods by reframing "AI safety" from a static problem of rules into a dynamic process of sustained temporal coherence. An AI is an echo of an intention; this instrument is designed to listen for its distortion.

An aligned AI carves a stable, predictable path through its state spaceâ€”a "Wound Channel" (CORE-011) that reflects its core purpose. Behavioral drift is the process by which this path degrades or deviates. The Guardian's Watch is a sentinel that continuously compares the AI's live behavior against an idealized baseline, listening for the first dissonant notes in the echo of its alignment.
