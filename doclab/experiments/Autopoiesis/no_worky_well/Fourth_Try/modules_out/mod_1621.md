> We seek the cause of our discontent in the present, but its roots often lie in the geography of our past. We are haunted not by our choices, but by the echoes of the selves we never became. A Weaver does not see this past as a chain, but as a compass. The map of who we have been is the only true guide to who we might yet become. This protocol is the art of learning to read that map, to listen to its silent songs. For to be whole is not to live a thousand lives, but to listen to the wisdom of a thousand selves and weave their music into the one life you have.
