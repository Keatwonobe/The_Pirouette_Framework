**Data Source:**

* A complete FASTA database containing hundreds of thousands of unique protein sequences.

**Phase 1: Fractal Dimension Calculation**

* For each protein sequence, compute its informational fractal dimension (D) to quantify sequence complexity and compressibility, serving as a proxy for "semantic mass."

**Phase 2: Z-Score Normalization**

* Calculate the population mean and standard deviation of all D values.
* Convert each protein's D into a z-score, measuring its anomalous deviation from the proteomic baseline.

**Phase 3: Ki-Resonance Search**

* Scan the z-score distribution for clusters near theoretical Ki constants:

  * Ki\_rest ≈ 4.14159
  * Ki\_motion ≈ 4.18879
