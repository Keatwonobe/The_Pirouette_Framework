Every settlement, from a tiny village to a great roaming city, has a collective City Entropy Budget. This is a measure of its overall stability, needs, and ability to withstand threats.

Formula: The GM can estimate a city's budget by multiplying its approximate population by an "Average Individual Budget" (AIB) that reflects the local standard of living.
City Budget = Population * AIB

A Tool for Adventure: This budget is a powerful tool for the GM to generate quests. By comparing the City's Budget to the entropic signature of its surroundings, a clear picture of the city's needs emerges:

If Environment EP > City EP: The city is in immediate danger from an overwhelming external threat (e.g., a massive bee swarm, an approaching fungal storm).

If a High EP Bubble is Nearby: The city may feel threatened by an unknown power and hire adventurers to investigate.

If Environment EP is Low: This signals a problem like a magical blight, a severe drought, or a curse, prompting the city to seek a solution.
