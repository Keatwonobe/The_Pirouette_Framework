A massive object—a dense locus of Ki resonance as described in CORE-008—does not simply create a smooth depression in the coherence manifold. It **warps the local Gyroidal Weave**. Its immense Temporal Pressure (Γ) stretches and distorts the resonant lattice of spacetime. The curvature of spacetime *is* the deformation of this fundamental gyroidal pattern.

An object in orbit is not being "pulled" by a force. It is following a geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—through the distorted labyrinth. This is the act of "coherence surfing" along the most stable path in a locally curved section of the universal weave. Gravity is the simple act of following the path of least resistance through a warped song.
