Version: 1.0 (proposal)
Status: Normative research program (complies with MATH‑018/019/020; links to COSMO‑Γ series)
Parents: [MATH‑018, MATH‑019, COSMO‑Γ‑000, COSMO‑Γ‑CMB, XXP‑015]
Children: [SECT‑Γ‑A, SECT‑Γ‑B, SECT‑Γ‑C]

Summary: "Purpose
Formalize and resolve the 29‑order‑of‑magnitude 'mass tension' between the lepton‑scale Pressuron mass (m_H ≈ 17 MeV from XXP‑015) and the cosmology‑scale requirement (m_L ≈ 10^−22 eV in fuzzy‑DM language) without violating MATH‑018 predictivity rules. Provide candidate mechanisms, minimal maths, falsifiable signatures, and code hooks.

Summary of the Tension
• Particle (UV/leptonic): XXP‑015 → a heavy Γ quantum m_H ≈ 17 MeV fits lepton g−2 portal effects.
• Cosmology (IR/halos): COSMO‑Γ requires galaxy‑scale coherence typically modelled by an ultralight field m_L ∼ 10^−22 eV *or* an equivalent long‑wavelength collective mode.
• Goal: show that (i) both phenomena arise from a single Γ sector, and (ii) the light mode governing structure is a *derived* eigenmode/collective excitation, not an ad‑hoc second particle with tuned mass."
