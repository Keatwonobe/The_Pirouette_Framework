For the spherical coherence manifold the eigen-energies scale as  
\(E_n\!\propto\!n^2-n+\tfrac14\).  
Minimization yields \(n=½\), corresponding to \(P(\theta)=e^{i\theta/2}\).  
Higher or fractional windings increase coherence strain; hence spin-½ is the dynamically selected ground state, not an imposed postulate.
