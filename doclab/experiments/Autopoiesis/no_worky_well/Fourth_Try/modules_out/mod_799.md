The Weaver's toolkit contains three primary gambits, each designed to address a specific pathology of flow as diagnosed by the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003).

1.  **The Key (To Cure Stagnation):** A targeted injection designed to dissolve a "Coherence Dam." This is not a brute-force demolition but the introduction of a catalyst—a missing resource, a critical piece of information, a new perspective—that allows the system's own pent-up potential to resume its flow.

2.  **The Tuning Fork (To Cure Fever):** A gentle, resonant signal introduced into a turbulent system. The goal is not to fight the chaos, but to offer it a more coherent, attractive rhythm to latch onto. The system, following its natural drive for coherence, entrains to the new signal and guides itself out of the storm.

3.  **The Scaffold (To Cure Erosion):** A supportive structure designed to reinforce a system's fading Wound Channel. This involves re-introducing the core patterns of a system's identity through ritual, training, or memory, helping it remember its healthy form and resist the pull of entropy.
