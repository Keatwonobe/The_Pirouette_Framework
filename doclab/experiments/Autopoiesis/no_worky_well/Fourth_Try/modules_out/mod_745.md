The drive for Symbiotic Resonance is a universal, scale-invariant dynamic, visible across all domains:

-   **At the Physical Scale:** The formation of a stable molecule like water is an Alchemical Union where hydrogen and oxygen atoms find a shared resonant state of vastly higher coherence than they possessed alone.
-   **At the Biological Scale:** A lichen, the symbiotic union of a fungus and an alga, can survive in harsh environments where neither organism could survive alone. They form a shared metabolism, a single `ùìõ_p`.
-   **At the Human Scale:** A high-functioning team, a deep friendship, or a loving partnership are all expressions of a shared coherence manifold. Participants anticipate one another's needs, communicate with minimal friction, and solve problems with a creativity that transcends individual capacity. Their union generates a tangible "coherence dividend."
