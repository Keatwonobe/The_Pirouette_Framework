When engaging in a practice where only one side is aware (lying, stealth, stealing, etc) the resolution is determined through a contested roll where one side is the entropy investment (declared beforehand) and the other is a roll against the relevant sensory organ (sight, sound, smell, etc). This series of checks is made with the Wisdom bonus of the creature rolling the dice. 

The outcome of the roll being higher than the entropy invested is a detection, a noise made in the dark, etc. The entropy investment being higher than the roll means the act was successful. 

The number of sides of the dice used for the check must be at least a number of sides equal to sensory organ investment and wisdom modifier added together, so a creature with two eyes, a nose and two ears with a +4 wisdom modifier would use a nine sided dice for their roll. Each creature rolls separately. If nobody beats the investment in stealth, the creature is undetected and for all purposes invisible to those in the area that failed their roll.

This is also applicable to mages casting invisibility spells using a skill or power, only with arcane entropy investiture. Feats used to detect magic can detect invisibility spells though, so rogues still have a benefit to doing things the old fashioned way.
