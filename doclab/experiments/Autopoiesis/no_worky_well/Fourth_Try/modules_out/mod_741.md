summary: Provides the definitive time-first model for attunement, the process by which
  distinct systems engage in a Resonant Handshake to form a single, unified, higher-order
  entity. It grounds the physics of empathy, trust, and collaboration in the Alchemical
  Union, framing them as a universal, energetically favorable strategy to maximize
  joint coherence.
