The state before existence was not a spatial void; it was a temporal one. It was a uniform field where all possible rhythms—every frequency, every phase—existed simultaneously in a perfect, unresolved superposition. The result was not chaos, but a profound and absolute silence. With no dominant rhythm, there could be no flow, no "before," and no "after." Time had not yet been born.

This is the **Silent Superposition**. It is the modern understanding of the "hollow cradle" or "whispering void"—a state of infinite temporal tension without release. It is a canvas stretched taut with the promise of every possible song, but without a single note yet played.
