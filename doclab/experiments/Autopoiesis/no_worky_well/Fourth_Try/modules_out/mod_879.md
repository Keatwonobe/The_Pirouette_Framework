This derived potential completes the Pirouette Lagrangian from `CORE-006`, transforming it from a conceptual model into a predictive engine:

`𝓛_p = K_τ(T_a, ω_k) - V_Γ(Γ, φ_{ij})`

Here, the engine is fully specified. The first term, `K_τ`, is the music the system plays—its own internal drive toward rhythmic being. The second term, our derived `V_Γ`, is the shape of the concert hall—the immutable, symmetric landscape it must navigate.

The "forces" of nature, to be derived in subsequent modules, are revealed to be nothing more than the gradients on this landscape (`-∇V_Γ`). A "force" is the path a system takes as it seeks the bottom of the Pressure Basin or settles into the grooves of the Phase Lock.
