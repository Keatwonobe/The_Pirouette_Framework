The answer to *why* the Transactional Pole is favored lies in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), the universe's objective function: 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ. A system evolves to maximize the integral of this function over time (the action, S_p).

When systems form connections to create a higher-order, unified entity—a "Weave"—the Lagrangian is profoundly affected, yielding a **Coherence Dividend**:

1.  **Pressure Cost is Shared (V_Γ decreases):** The Weave creates a shared, stable internal environment. The cost of resisting external chaos (Γ) is distributed across the entire network, lowering the effective pressure `V_Γ` experienced by each component.
2.  **Coherence is Amplified (K_τ increases):** The unified system develops a new, richer, and more stable Ki pattern. The new combined coherence `Kτ_C` is not merely the sum of its parts (`Kτ_A + Kτ_B`), but `Kτ_A + Kτ_B + Kτ_interaction`, where the interaction term is a large, positive value representing the emergent stability of the new form. Thus, `Kτ_C >> Kτ_A + Kτ_B`.

By adopting a transactional strategy, the Weave dramatically increases its Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`) and therefore its integrated action (`S_p`), becoming a more efficient, stable, and resilient way to exist. Selfishness creates friction and turbulence; altruism is the geometry of laminar flow.
