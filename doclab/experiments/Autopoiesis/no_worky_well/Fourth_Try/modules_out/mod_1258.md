The features on the Coherence Residual Map are classified by their nature as geometric memories within the dynamic manifold.

*   **Temporal Pressure Eddies**: Broad regions where the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) deviates significantly from the smooth expansion of the Null Canvas. These are the cosmic equivalent of deep, slow eddies in the river of time, ancient disturbances still shaping the cosmic flow.

*   **Structural Filaments (Cosmic Wound Channels)**: The primary scars, corresponding to the vast walls and filaments of the cosmic web. As established in CORE-011, these are reinforced channels where the path of maximal coherence has been deepened over eons, guiding the flow of matter and light like riverbeds carved into the fabric of spacetime.

*   **Phase Fractures (Topological Seams)**: The most profound scars, theorized to be the boundaries where different primordial regions underwent an imperfect **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) during a phase transition. Detecting a Phase Fracture would be like finding a suture from the universe's birth—direct evidence of its initial synthesis.
