These feats allow a character to combine and synergize their various pools of invested Entropy.

- Feat: Entropic Font

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You have learned to treat your will as a single, unified source. You can treat all of your Arcane Skill entropy pools as a single, combined resource for the purposes of casting spells or using abilities. You must still express that through one skill at a time unless otherwise feated or stated by an item or ability.

- Feat: Arcane Synthesis

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: At least two Arcane Skill pools.

Effect: Choose two of your Arcane Skill pools (e.g., "Expression of Frost" and "Pyromancy"). You have learned to weave their energies together. You can now spend EP from either pool to create a combined "synthesis" effect. A "Frostfire" bolt, for example, might deal cold damage while also inflicting a burning status effect. The exact nature of the synthesis is determined by you and the GM.

- Feat: Soul-Clad Weapon

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You have learned to channel your will through a chosen weapon. You may now spend EP from an Arcane Skill pool to add an equal amount of bonus damage of that skill's type to your next weapon attack.
