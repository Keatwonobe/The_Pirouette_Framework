With the system's heartbeat rendered visible, the second stage begins: finding the cause of the arrhythmia. This is the function of **Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA)**, the core insight preserved and modernized from `PPS-014`.

RPA is a Pareto Chisel. It inverts the classic 80/20 principle to find the "critical few"â€”the smallest possible set of causes responsible for the vast majority of the "effect." In this context, the "effect" is coherence loss.
