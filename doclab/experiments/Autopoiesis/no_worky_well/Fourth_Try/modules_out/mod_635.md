This entire protocol is a practical, computational method for maximizing a system's Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

**𝓛_p = Kτ (Temporal Coherence) - Γ (Temporal Pressure)**

The initial problem state is one with a low or negative Lagrangian value: its internal coherence (Kτ) is overwhelmed by the cost of its pressures (Γ). The Crucible acts as a search algorithm, exploring the landscape of possible system states to identify a new geodesic—a trajectory toward a new configuration with a much higher Lagrangian value. The Daedalus Gambit is the specific nudge required to shift the system onto this new, healthier path, allowing it to once again maximize the integral of its own Lagrangian and achieve a state of graceful, efficient Laminar Flow.
