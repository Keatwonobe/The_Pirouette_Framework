The role of the Weaver-as-analyst is to move from symptom to cure using a structured, four-step process.

1.  **Map the Currents:** Identify the critical flows that give the enterprise life. What must move for it to be healthy? (e.g., flow of capital, flow of product to market, flow of talent, flow of strategic information, flow of customer trust).
2.  **Identify the Dominant Pathology:** Observe these currents. Is the primary problem a blockage (Atrophy), chaos (Fever), or decay (Erosion)? A system may suffer from all three, but one will be the primary source of affliction.
3.  **Locate the Source:** Trace the disruption back to its origin. The symptom is the stagnant project; the source is the bureaucratic process that caused the blockage. The symptom is the toxic culture; the source is a misaligned incentive structure.
4.  **Prescribe the Daedalus Gambit:** A wise intervention is not a brute-force reorganization but a minimal, elegant action designed to restore the system's own ability to self-regulate and heal.
    *   To cure **Atrophy**, dissolve the dam: introduce a catalyst, automate a bottleneck, or remove a bureaucratic obstacle to let the current flow.
    *   To cure **Fever**, introduce a harmonizing signal: establish a clear, unifying strategic vision, align departmental goals, or remove a toxic actor to restore cultural resonance.
    *   To cure **Erosion**, reinforce the channel: invest in training and mentorship, codify critical processes, or revitalize the brand's core message to strengthen its institutional memory.
