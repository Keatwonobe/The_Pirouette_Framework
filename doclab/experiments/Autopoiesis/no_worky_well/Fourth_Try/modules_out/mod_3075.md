\section*{§7 · Coupling to the Pressuron Field}
SECT-Γ-A describes a superfluid pressuron condensate with density $\rho_p$ and sound speed $c_s$.  
Identify
\[
\rho_p = \rho_{\Gamma,\text{res}},
\qquad
c_s^2 = \frac{\partial P_\Gamma}{\partial\rho_\Gamma}
      = \frac{1}{3}(1-\epsilon).
\]
Hence the pressuron behaves as a *superfluid cosmological constant*: it provides pressure $P_p=-\rho_p$ at large scales yet supports phonon excitations that may source small dark-matter-like corrections.
