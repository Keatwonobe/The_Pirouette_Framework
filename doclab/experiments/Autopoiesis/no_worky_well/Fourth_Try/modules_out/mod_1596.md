The process of entrainment is a direct manifestation of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)**.

Two uncoupled systems each follow their own geodesic, independently maximizing the integral of their own Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`). When they interact, the resonance of each system introduces a new, fluctuating term into the other's experience of Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). This creates a turbulent, inefficient state for both.

Entrainment is the process by which the coupled systems collaboratively discover a new, shared geodesic—a stable relative phase `Δθ`—that maximizes the coherence of the *total combined system*. The locked state is not a coincidence; it is the optimal, most efficient solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations for the new, unified entity. It is the path of least action for the whole.
