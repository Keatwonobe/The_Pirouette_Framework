The output of the Crucible is not a rigid task list, but a far more elegant and potent object: a **Daedalus Gambit**. As defined in DYNA-003, this is the wisest, most precise, and minimal set of actions required to restore the system's own ability to self-regulate.

*   To heal **Atrophy**, the gambit is the key that dissolves the dam.
*   To heal **Fever**, the gambit is the harmonizing signal that calms the storm.
*   To heal **Erosion**, the gambit is the reinforcement that strengthens the fraying thread.

In practice, the Gambit is compiled into a directed graph of tasks, each with clear objectives, success metrics, and the necessary energy (bounty) to incentivize its completion.
