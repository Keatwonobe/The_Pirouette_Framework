The modernization allows for more direct measurement and intervention, shifting the focus from the old triaxial fields to their unified temporal origin.

Temporal Desynchronization (Δτ): Continuous measurement of the phase difference between agent and environment. Flow is maintained when ∣Δτ∣ is minimal.

Temporal Pressure Variance (σ_T): The stability of the challenge. Flow requires a smooth, non-volatile challenge level.

Coherence Flux (Φ_C): The efficiency of the agent's energy cycle. In flow, this value should approach its theoretical maximum.

Biometric Proxies: Heart-rate variability and EEG synchrony remain excellent proxies, now understood as physical manifestations of the body's successful temporal resonance.

The training protocols from PPS-038 (Calibration, Induction, Sustain, Reflection) are retained and reinforced, now with the explicit goal of training an agent's ability to quickly and robustly synchronize their internal clock with their environment.
