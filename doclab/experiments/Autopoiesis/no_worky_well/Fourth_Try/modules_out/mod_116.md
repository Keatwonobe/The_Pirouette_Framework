Every entity, as defined in CORE-004, exists as a stable pattern of resonance (Ki) within the broader Temporal Pressure (Γ). This pattern defines a local coherence manifold—the landscape of the entity's being.

The observer, too, is such an entity, possessing a complex and dynamic Ki pattern shaped by memory, biology, and intention. When observation occurs, the observer's Ki pattern projects onto the coherence manifold of the observed. This projection is not a neutral act; it has a shape and a pressure. We call this geometric imprint The Observer's Shadow.

The Shadow is the set of boundary conditions that the observer imposes on the observed. It is the question that forces an answer from a state of quantum superposition. It is the focus that amplifies one resonance and dampens others. It is the shape of the observer's own being, cast across the fabric of another.
