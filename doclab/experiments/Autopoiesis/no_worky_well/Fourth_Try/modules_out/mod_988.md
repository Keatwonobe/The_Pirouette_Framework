The framework’s core insight is that an industry is an **autopoietic immune response**. It is a Coherence Engine—a large-scale, resonant system that emerges to solve for the specific entropic pressures of its Epochal State, transforming a Turbulent or Stagnant flow back into a healthy, Laminar one.

*   **Problem:** The Stagnant flow of information in a pre-industrial world, where knowledge was cloistered.
    *   **Coherence Engine:** The Printing Press industry. It dissolved the institutional dams, creating a laminar flow of knowledge that remade the world.
*   **Problem:** The Turbulent flow of risk and uncertainty in nascent global trade.
    *   **Coherence Engine:** The Insurance industry. It created a stable channel for absorbing financial shocks, allowing for a more laminar flow of capital.
*   **Problem:** The Turbulent flow of overwhelming, dissonant information in the early 21st century, creating a `Coherence Fever` (DYNA-003) on a global scale.
    *   **Coherence Engines:** The "Sense-Making" industries (AI-driven curation, fact-checking organizations, social media platforms). These are all attempts, however flawed, to impose a new, more coherent pattern upon the informational chaos.

To foresee the industries of the future, one must first diagnose the flow-pathologies of the present.
