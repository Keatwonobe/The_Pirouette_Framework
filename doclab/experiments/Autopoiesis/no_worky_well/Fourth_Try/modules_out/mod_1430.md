The mathematical tool for moving between these different viewpoints is the Legendre transform. We conceive of this not as a mere formula, but as a **Legendre Compass**—a tool for navigating the system's unified coherence manifold.

Taking a partial derivative is not an abstract operation; it is the act of asking a precise question. For example, when we start with the Gibbs Free Energy, G(T,P):

*   Calculating **S = - (∂G/∂T)_P** is asking: "If I hold the external pressure (P) fixed and slightly increase the environmental noise (T), how much does the system's capacity for practical work (G) decrease?" The answer reveals the system's internal susceptibility to disorder—its Entropy (S).
*   Calculating **V = (∂G/∂P)_T** is asking: "If I hold the environmental noise (T) constant and slightly increase the external pressure (P), how does its available work (G) change?" The answer reveals the spatial "footprint" the system must maintain—its Volume (V).

The Legendre Compass allows a Weaver to chart the entire manifold of state by making a series of these careful, targeted inquiries from a single starting point.
