An entity can create or shape matter from raw entropy.

Formula: Creating a 5x5x5 foot cube of a simple element (earth, ice, etc.) costs 5 EP. This scales linearly. A 10-foot-tall, 60-foot-long wall of ice would cost (10/5) * (60/5) * 5 = 2 * 12 * 5 = 120 EP.

Weaponizing the Environment: A shaped element can be used as an attack. A 5x5x5 foot block of ice can be hurled to deal 1d5 damage.
