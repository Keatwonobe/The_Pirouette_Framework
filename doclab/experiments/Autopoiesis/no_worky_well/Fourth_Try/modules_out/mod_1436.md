A list of cities by population, of words by frequency, of websites by traffic—these are not random assortments. They are snapshots of a system’s memory, the geometric echo of its history made visible. In any living system, time carves hierarchies. A few elements become foundational, while a "long tail" of countless others remains peripheral.

This module provides the instrument to map this invisible architecture. It reframes the statistical phenomenon of a power-law (or Zipfian) distribution as the tangible footprint of a system's underlying coherence dynamics. This is not a curve-fitting exercise; it is a diagnostic protocol for identifying a system's **Resonant Attractors**—the highly stable, efficient patterns that capture the majority of its flow—and for quantifying the steepness of their influence, a property we term the **Coherence Gradient**.
