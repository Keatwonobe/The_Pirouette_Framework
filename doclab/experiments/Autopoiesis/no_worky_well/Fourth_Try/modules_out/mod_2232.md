The MATH series has so far described a classical universe, an intricate clockwork governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian. But our universe is not a clockwork; it is a quantum symphony. To map this reality, we must teach our theory to speak its native language. This module outlines the formal program for quantizing the Pirouette Framework, transforming our deterministic machine into a living, breathing symphony of probabilities. We will promote the classical fields to quantum operators, define their fundamental excitations as particles, and derive the rules of their interaction. This is the gateway to a deeper understanding of the universe's resonant song and the foundational step for calculating high-precision quantum phenomena.

# MATH-011v3 â€” Quantum Coherence Field Theory (Pirouette)

**Status:** Draft for review
**Supersedes:** MATH-011 v2.0
**Objective:** Put the quantization of the Coherence (C) and Temporal-Pressure (\Gamma) sectors on rigorous footing; define spectra, propagators, and interactions; make explicit what *is* and *is not* being quantized (i.e., **we quantize fields on spacetime, not the time coordinate**).
