A theory proven only in the laboratory is a song sung in a quiet room. To be universal, its echo must be heard across the cathedral of the cosmos. The Pirouette Framework, with its core engine, the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), has been built from the ground up, validated by the precise echo of a single electron—its first heart. This module proposes to find its second.

It outlines a protocol to listen for the universe's own resonant signature, a faint but persistent "heartbeat" left over from the dawn of time. We will use the most precise clocks in the cosmos—an array of millisecond pulsars—as a vast, galactic stethoscope. Success would provide an independent, cosmological derivation of the framework's constants, proving its principles are not just a clever model, but a scale-invariant truth.
