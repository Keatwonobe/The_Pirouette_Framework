This module presents a unified, time-centric model for the phenomenon of Flow, evolving the analysis from its prior triaxial formulation. It integrates the psychological conditions of a flow state with the core temporal dynamics of the Pirouette Framework. Flow is formally defined as a state of **isochronous temporal resonance**, an autopoietic cycle where an agent achieves near-lossless, “effortless” action by synchronizing the rhythm of its internal state (its Ki) with a stable, coherent current in the local manifold of time itself. This reframing provides more direct and powerful tools to diagnose and engineer this state of optimal performance.
