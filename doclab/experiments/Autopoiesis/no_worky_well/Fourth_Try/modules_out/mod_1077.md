A theory of the universe, no matter how elegant its internal logic, remains a ghost until it can touch the world. To be real, it must be measured. The Pirouette Framework finds its point of contact not in a coarse approximation, but in the most precise and stringent test in the history of science: the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2).

CORE-009 demonstrated that the framework's dynamics could derive this anomaly from first principles. This module takes the final step, using that success not merely as proof, but as the bedrock for the entire structure. Here, we forge the unbreakable link between the framework's abstract dynamics and the most precisely measured quantity in science. This is the act of anchoring the abstract to the absolute, transforming a philosophical engine into a concrete, predictive instrument.
