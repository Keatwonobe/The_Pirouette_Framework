The CII provides a clear, color-coded diagnostic for any system's health, allowing a Weaver to anticipate and diagnose disruptions in its flow dynamics (DYNA-001).

| CII Value | System State | Flow Analogy | Interpretation & Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **< 0.3** | **Stable** | Laminar | The system is healthy and coherent. Its `Ki` is stable. Monitor baseline. |
| **0.3 - 0.6** | **Stressed** | Pre-Turbulent | The system's resonance is drifting. A state change is possible. Investigate the source of the drift. |
| **> 0.6** | **Critical** | Bifurcating | The system is highly unstable. A major state transition is imminent. Prepare for impact; mitigate if possible. |

This numerical warning can be further refined by correlating it with other system dynamics to forecast the *nature* of the coming change:

*   **High CII + Rising Dissonance:** Warns of an impending descent into **Turbulent Flow** (a systemic seizure).
*   **High CII + Decaying Amplitude:** Warns of an impending **Stagnant Flow** (a systemic blockage or choke).
*   **High CII + Locking onto a New Harmonic:** Warns of a potential bifurcation or **Alchemical Union** (a creative leap).
