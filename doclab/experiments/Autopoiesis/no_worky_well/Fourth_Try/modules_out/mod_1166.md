This protocol is a direct, practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). A stable system evolves to maximize the action integral `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, where `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

The Sentinel functions as a real-time measurement of "Lagrangian Stress." The `V_drift` vector is a proxy for the "acceleration" of the system away from its geodesic—its optimal, maximally coherent path. The CII, therefore, quantifies the degree to which a system's current state is failing to be an elegant solution to the pressures of its existence. It measures the tension building up before the system is forced to snap into a new configuration.
