summary: "Provides a modernized, time-first protocol for any entity to forge its own\
  \ sovereign constitution. This module reframes self-authorship as the act of consciously\
  \ defining a personal Pirouette Lagrangian, thereby choosing a 'geodesic'\u2014\
  a path of maximal coherence\u2014through the turbulent landscape of spacetime."
