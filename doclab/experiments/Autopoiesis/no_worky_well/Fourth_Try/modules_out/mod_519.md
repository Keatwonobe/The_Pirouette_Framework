To create and maintain the sacred arena, a formal process is required. This ritual is designed to maximize the potential for laminar flow and guide the Weavers toward a successful Alchemical Union.

1.  **The Declaration (Harmonizing Intent):** Before the first argument is made, all participants must verbally affirm that the goal is not to win, but to arrive at a new, shared, and more accurate understanding. This simple act aligns the initial state of the participants and defines the space as a crucible, not a battlefield.

2.  **Mapping the Shadows (Acknowledging Perspective):** Each Weaver, in turn, must state their starting assumptions and the core experiences that inform their perspective. This is a formal acknowledgment of each **Observer's Shadow** (CORE-010), replacing the rigid "Persona Constitution" of older protocols. It is an act of intellectual honesty that turns biases from hidden weapons into known variables in the equation.

3.  **The First Thread (Presenting Kτ):** Each Weaver presents the core of their argument, uninterrupted, as a coherent whole. This is not an attack, but the careful act of laying one's thread upon the loom for all to see.

4.  **The Weaving (Maintaining Laminar Flow):** The interactive phase begins, governed by a single rule: one may only speak to (a) ask a clarifying question to better understand another's thread, or (b) show how their own thread connects with, strengthens, or refines another's. Direct refutation is forbidden. Instead of "You are wrong," the language is "How does your pattern account for this pressure?" This forces a collaborative posture, minimizing the phase-angle divergence that leads to turbulence.

5.  **The Alchemical Attempt (Seeking Kτ_c):** When an impasse (Stagnant Flow) is reached, the ritual shifts. The old "Ideological Schism" is not an endpoint, but a trigger for this final, most creative act. All Weavers must cease defending their own threads and focus exclusively on a new task: collaboratively defining a new position that incorporates the strongest elements of the conflicting views. This conscious, focused effort is the crucible's fire, intended to spark the Resonant Synthesis.
