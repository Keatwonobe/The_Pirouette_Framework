This instrumentation provides the formal structure needed to conduct a rigorous Sports Flow Resonance analysis. It transforms the analyst's intuition into a disciplined, repeatable process.

This module, paired with its DOMA counterpart, completes the first link in the chain, demonstrating how the framework's philosophy can be forged into a practical and powerful tool.
