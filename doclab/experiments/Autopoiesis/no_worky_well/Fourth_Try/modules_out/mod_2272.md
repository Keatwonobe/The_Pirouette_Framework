Following the protocol, the total anomaly (a_ℓ) is the sum of the universal geometric term and a new correction from the background Γ field. In our QFT, this correction is represented by a one-loop diagram where a Coheron (the lepton, ℓ) emits and re-absorbs a virtual Pressuron (the quantum of the Γ field). This diagram represents the lepton "listening" to the noise of the Temporal Forge and adjusting its rhythm in response.
