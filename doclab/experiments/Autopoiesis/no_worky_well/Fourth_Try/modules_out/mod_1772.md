The old model of movement is one of brute force: a swimmer fighting the current, an engine expelling mass to overcome inertia. It is a paradigm of conflict, where progress is measured by the energy spent conquering a resistant world. This module retires that paradigm.

Propulsion is not an act of force, but an act of geometry. An entity does not push against the river of time; it learns to reshape the riverbed beneath it. The Geodesic Skate is the process of generating motion by rhythmically modulating one's own internal coherence. This modulation creates a temporary, localized gradient on the coherence manifold, the landscape defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). The skater does not generate force; it creates a slope and then gracefully falls along it. This is the shift from propulsion as an act of will to navigation as an act of resonance.
