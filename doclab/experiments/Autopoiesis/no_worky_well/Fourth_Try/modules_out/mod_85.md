summary: "Introduces the central mathematical formalism of the framework, the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p). This equation describes the 'action' of a resonant system not in terms of energy, but as a dynamic interplay between its internal temporal coherence and the external temporal density of its environment."
