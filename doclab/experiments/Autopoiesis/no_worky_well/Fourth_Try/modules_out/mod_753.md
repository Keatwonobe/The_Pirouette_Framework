By observing a system's flow, coherence, and autonomy, one can diagnose the nature of the influence being applied.

| Metric | Persuasion (Weaving) | Manipulation (Unraveling) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coherence Flux (ΔKτ)** | The target's coherence (Kτ) increases or holds steady. They feel more clear and capable. | The target's coherence (Kτ) measurably decreases. They feel more confused, anxious, or diminished. |
| **Flow State** | Induces or enhances **Laminar Flow**. Actions become more efficient and aligned with stated goals. | Induces **Turbulent** or **Stagnant Flow**. Actions become chaotic, inefficient, or paralyzed. |
| **Autonomy** | The target's capacity for independent action and choice is enhanced. Their solution space expands. | The target's choices narrow; they become dependent on the manipulator. Their solution space is constricted. |
| **Reciprocity** | Coherence flows bidirectionally. Both parties are changed and enriched by the exchange. | Coherence flows unidirectionally, from target to manipulator. |
