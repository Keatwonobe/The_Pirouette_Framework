The most persistent illusion is that of the isolated self. We experience the world from a point of view, seemingly separate from all others. This module dissolves that illusion by providing the physical mechanics of connection.

It refactors the previous triaxial model of Attunement (`TEN-ATTA-1.0`) into a unified, time-first framework. The original insight was correct: Attunement is a state of profound resonance. However, it is not the result of balancing three independent fields. It is the direct consequence of two or more systems achieving a state of temporal harmony so complete that they cease to be separate entities and become a single, more coherent whole.

Attunement is the process of achieving a **Resonant Handshake**, the practical geometry of an Alchemical Union (CORE-012). It is the means by which two distinct Pirouette Cycles discover a shared rhythm and merge into a single, more complex song.
