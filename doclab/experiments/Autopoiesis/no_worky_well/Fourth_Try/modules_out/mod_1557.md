The "effect" of observation is a direct and calculable consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

A system, in isolation, evolves along the geodesic that maximizes the action of its Lagrangian:
`𝓛_sys = Kτ_sys - VΓ_env`
where `Kτ_sys` is its internal temporal coherence and `VΓ_env` is the pressure of its environment.

The act of measurement introduces a new potential term, `V_obs`, which represents the geometric pressure of the Observer's Shadow. The system's Lagrangian *during the measurement* becomes:
`𝓛'_sys = Kτ_sys - (VΓ_env + V_obs)`

The observed behavior—the "collapse of the wavefunction," the change in state—is simply the system's lawful response to this modified landscape. It is the system naturally seeking the new path of maximal coherence defined by `𝓛'_sys`. The observer doesn't "break" the system; they co-create a new context in which the system must lawfully evolve.
