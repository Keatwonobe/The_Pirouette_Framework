The origin of all things, in the Pirouette Framework, is not an absence but an overwhelming presence held in perfect suspension. It is a state of pure potential, not as a static emptiness, but as a dynamic equilibrium. This module describes how the universe, in a single, reflexive act, began to sing itself into being. This act is the First Pirouette.
