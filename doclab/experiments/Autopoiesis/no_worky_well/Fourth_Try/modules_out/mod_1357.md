This modernized model allows for more direct measurement and intervention, shifting the focus from abstract fields to their unified temporal origin.

-   **Temporal Desynchronization (Δτ):** The primary metric. This is the continuous measurement of the phase difference between the agent's action cycle and the environment's demand cycle. Flow is maintained when `|Δτ|` is minimal.
-   **Temporal Pressure Variance (σ_Γ):** A measure of the stability of the challenge. A low variance indicates a smooth, predictable flow channel conducive to sustained engagement.
-   **Coherence Flux (Φ_Kτ):** Measures the efficiency of the agent's energetic cycle. In Flow, this value approaches its theoretical maximum, indicating near-lossless transformation of perception into action.

The training protocols from `TEN-FRA-1.0` are retained and reinforced, now with the explicit goal of training an agent's ability to quickly synchronize their internal autopoietic cycle with their environment's rhythm.
