- A. Exact Ta estimator and error model (use the phase-mean definition above) .  
- B. Shadow-Gauge accounting: how to meter \(V_{\text{obs}}\) (probe power, data granularity) and publish caps.  
- C. Ki-aware transitions: if levers risk crossing a “snap” threshold, require soft-start ramps and explicit consent (see Inertial Leap) .
