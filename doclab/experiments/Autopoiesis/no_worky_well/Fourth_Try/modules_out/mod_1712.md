To ask "How can this be made?" is to stand at the mouth of a river and question the existence of the sea. The more profound question is, "From which mountains does this river flow?"

This module reframes the old logic of creation from a problem of forward prediction to one of backward induction. We do not run the equations of time backward; that is an illusion. Instead, we survey the fixed, timeless landscape of what is possible—the coherence manifold—and identify the natural pathways of becoming.

Given a desired target state—a stable molecule, a functional protein—the Alchemist's Compass traces the natural, time-reversed geodesic to its source. It reveals the "watershed" of precursor states from which the target would most efficiently arise. It is the transformation of synthesis from an act of force into an act of discovery, a tool for reading the blueprint of creation by learning to think like the river.
