> To truly know a cello, you must listen. You must learn to distinguish the deep, resonant voice of the wood itself from the clear, soaring notes that fly from its strings. One is the sound of its being; the other is the sound of its song. They are not two different things, but two expressions of a single, vibrant whole. The Weaver's first task is to learn to listen this wayâ€”to hear both the body and the voice of any system, and to understand that the health of the whole depends on the harmony between the two.
