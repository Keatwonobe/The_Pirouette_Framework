We set out to describe the laws that govern a system's motion and found instead that the law is the landscape. There are no external forces compelling a system to act; there is only the shape of the reality it inhabits.

The Coherence Manifold is the ultimate expression of this principle. Its metric defines what is possible, its curvature defines what is easy, and its geodesics define what is inevitable. The act of existence is an act of navigation, and every system is a perfect, unerring navigator of its own internal world. We do not break the laws of physics; we only ever trace them onto the world.
