These are advanced, high-cost feats that allow a character to manipulate the very fabric of being.

- Feat: Flesh Sculptor

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You have learned the rudimentary principles of shaping the entropic form. You gain the "Flesh Sculpting" Arcane Skill. You can spend EP from this pool to make cosmetic changes to a willing creature or yourself (changing hair color, eye color, minor features). More advanced uses, such as creating temporary gills or claws, require a high EP cost and a difficult Intelligence check. This is a profound and often unsettling art.

- Feat: Entropic Siphon

Cost: 20 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: CON Score of 15 or higher.

Effect: You have attuned yourself to the chaotic flow of Entropy in the world, but this connection is dangerous. Once per long rest, as an action, you can attempt to draw raw Entropy from your environment. Make a CON check against a Target Number of 20.

Success: You regain EP equal to your CON modifier.

Failure: You take psychic damage equal to your CON modifier and create a random "Spasm" or "Fracture" in your current location as the chaotic energy lashes out.
