Summary: "Purpose
Realize the 17 MeV pressuron as a **microscopic constituent** of a cosmic superfluid whose **collective phonon mode** supplies the ultralight, long‑wavelength dynamics needed for structure formation, without introducing a new fundamental particle. Encode the superfluid in a symmetry‑respecting P(X) EFT; derive halo cores, merger behavior, and CMB‑consistent linear perturbations; set falsifiable signatures.

Interpretive Bridge
Your description (“tension to space… surface tension against gravity… vacuum as fuzzy baseline that creeps like the CMB”) maps cleanly to a **compressible superfluid** with: (i) finite surface tension at interfaces, (ii) phonon sound speed c_s, (iii) rarefied “desert” regions where density n → 0 and phase stiffness weakens."
