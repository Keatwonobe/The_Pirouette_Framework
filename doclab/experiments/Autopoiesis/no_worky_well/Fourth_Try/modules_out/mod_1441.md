This protocol works in reverse to engineer a desired system state. Given a target property (e.g., "the top 1% of nodes must not account for more than 50% of total influence"), it can solve for the Coherence Gradient (`Î±`) required to produce that outcome. This transforms the instrument from a passive diagnostic tool into an active design template for building more resilient or efficient systems.
