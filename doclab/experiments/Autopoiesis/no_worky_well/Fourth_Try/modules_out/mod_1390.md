The power of this instrument lies in its fractal applicability across domains, as enabled by the **Fractal Bridge (CORE-014)**.

*   **Chemistry:** Mapping the coherence landscape of a molecule to find its stable conformations and predict reaction pathways.
*   **Evolutionary Biology:** Charting the fitness landscape of a species to identify evolutionary stable strategies.
*   **Economics:** Modeling market dynamics to find stable equilibrium points and predict the impact of economic shocks.
*   **Psychology:** Mapping a person's "state space" of beliefs and behaviors to identify stable personality traits and the barriers to personal change.
