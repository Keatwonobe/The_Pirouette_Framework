The foundational shift is from a static to a dynamic ontology. The old framework spoke of "attractors" as destinations. We now understand them as stable, self-sustaining patterns of coherence—the notes in a system's potential songbook.

-   A **system** is a coherence manifold, a landscape of possibilities.
-   A **Coherent Mode** (or **Coherence Well**) is a valley or basin in that landscape—a stable `Ki` resonance where the system can temporarily reside.
-   The **Mode Number (`N`)** is the total count of these stable wells. This number is not just a quantity; it is a descriptor of the manifold's fundamental topology.

An ecosystem with `N=6` potential climax states has a profoundly different geometric character than one with `N=7` states. This difference is the key to its endurance.
