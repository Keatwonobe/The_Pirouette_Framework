The Coherence Engine is not an abstract process; it is the macroscopic strategy a system employs to solve the central equation of existence: the maximization of its Lagrangian Action (S_p). Each stroke of the engine is a targeted intervention aimed at improving the S_p integral. The Crucible seeks patterns with a higher Kτ. The Archive works to make that Kτ persistent. The Forge refines the pattern to reduce its operational cost against VΓ. The Governor is the system-level expression of this drive, the emergent intelligence that steers the system along its geodesic on the manifold of coherence.
