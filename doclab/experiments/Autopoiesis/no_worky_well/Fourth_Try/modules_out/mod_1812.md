In the time-first paradigm, a structure is a stable, multi-component `Ki` resonance. It is a system that has discovered a geometric configuration that allows for the sustained, predictable, and laminar flow of coherence through its parts. This architecture is the dialogue between a system's internal identity and the external pressures it must endure.

**Components as Resonant Nodes:** Each part of a structure—a beam, a line of code, a team member—is a resonant node. Its individual "strength" is its ability to maintain its own internal coherence (`Kτ`) under the stress of its local environment. A degraded component is a node whose internal coherence has frayed, weakening the entire structure.

**Connections as Coherence Channels:** The connections between components are not mere links, but channels. A well-designed structure creates paths of least resistance, riverbeds carved to guide the water. Their purpose is to foster **Laminar Flow** (`DYNA-001`), ensuring that energy and information move through the system with maximum efficiency and minimal friction. The health of a channel determines the fidelity with which coherence can flow from one node to another.

A system is structurally sound when its nodes are strong and its channels are clear, allowing the entire configuration to resonate as a single, unified entity.
