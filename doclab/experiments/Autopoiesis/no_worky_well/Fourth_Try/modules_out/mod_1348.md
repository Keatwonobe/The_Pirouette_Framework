A system corrects its course because its path of maximal coherence has been altered. This is governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. The feedback mechanism modifies the system's Lagrangian by adding a new potential term, `V_dissonance`, which increases with the magnitude of the error signal.

`𝓛_adaptive = Kτ - (V_Γ_external + V_dissonance)`

The Dissonance signal creates a steep "coherence gradient" (∇𝓛_p) in the manifold. The "corrective action" is the system naturally evolving along its new geodesic, flowing 'downhill' along this gradient to find the path of least resistance. It corrects itself not because it is programmed with a rule, but because remaining in a state of error is a state of high-pressure, low-coherence, and is therefore dynamically unfavorable.

The old concept of "loop gain" is elegantly re-expressed as the *sensitivity of the system's Lagrangian to dissonance*.
