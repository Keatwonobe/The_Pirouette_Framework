1. **Philosophical Synthesis:** We agree that **the act** defines accountability. Yet, an actor’s **intent capacity** (encoded in parametrics) informs **responsibility thresholds**.  
2. **Preventing Gaming Vectors:** Purely post-act focus can be gamed via **zero-day pulses**—brief, intense actions whose residuals diffuse below detection thresholds outside the fence.  
3. **Moral-Technical Equilibrium:** A philosophy of **responsibility layering** demands both:  
   - **Actor Intent Profiling:** Pre-act gates gauge risk appetite.  
   - **Act Trace Accountability:** Wound Channel maps actual impact.
