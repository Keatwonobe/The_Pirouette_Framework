The "geodesic" is the path of least resistance and greatest grace. Walking is the geodesic of your recovery.

The Practice:

Start Slow: Begin with the 3-5 minute walks from Phase I.

Gradual Progression: Add just one minute every other day, as long as it feels good. The goal is not to push through pain, but to slowly expand the boundaries of what feels comfortable.

The "Conversation Test": The right pace is one where you can comfortably hold a conversation without becoming breathless. If you are gasping for air, you are moving too fast. This is your body's natural speedometer.

Helper's Role (The Pacesetter):

Walk With Them: Walk beside the patient, matching their pace. Your steady presence is a non-verbal encouragement.

Be the Conversation: Your job is to manage the "Conversation Test." Keep them engaged in a light, pleasant conversation. If their speech becomes strained, it's a clear signal to slow down.

Be the Eyes: Watch the path for them. Your focus on the terrain allows them to focus on their own body and rhythm.

Frequency: Once per day, preferably at the same time to build a strong rhythm.
