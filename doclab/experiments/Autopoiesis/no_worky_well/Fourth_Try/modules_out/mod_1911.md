summary: 'Provides a modernized, time-first theory for a new class of astrophysical
  object: the Maw. Re-frames Maws as stable, non-singular solutions to the Pirouette
  Lagrangian under extreme conditions. Details the ''Coherence Quake'' mechanism that
  produces their unique ''Thumper'' gravitational wave signature, a primary falsifiable
  prediction of the framework that is deeply linked to the dark matter alternative.'
