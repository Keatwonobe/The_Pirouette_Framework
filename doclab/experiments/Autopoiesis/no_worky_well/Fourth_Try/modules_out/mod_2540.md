**Boundary Definition and the Sentinel Protocol's Implementation Complexity**
While your Sentinel Protocol (PDM-001) addresses boundary definitions dynamically—effectively mitigating certain types of strategic gaming—it currently relies heavily on recursive and iterative debate processes (Reflexive Boundary Rituals and Adaptive Feedback Loops). This is philosophically and theoretically elegant but could quickly become a practical bottleneck.

* **Computational Feasibility & Infinite Regress**:
  The skepticism noted by your "Consensus Swarm" rightly flags that the recursive moderation and fractal mini-debates can spiral indefinitely. You have addressed it conceptually, but there's still a need for explicitly defined practical termination criteria (e.g., recursion depth limits, resource constraints).

* **Boundary-Gaming Risks**:
  The notion of Dynamic Gates is strong, yet sophisticated adversaries might still game the emergent boundaries by subtly influencing local coherence measures or pushing subtle micro-harm tactics that stay just below detection thresholds for cumulative residue.

Your proposal of clearly defined stopping rules, polynomial-time heuristics, and more rigorous cross-domain validations, as suggested by your skeptics, are necessary refinements. Currently, the complexity of governance might inadvertently introduce new vulnerabilities or inequities, especially in resource-poor scenarios.
