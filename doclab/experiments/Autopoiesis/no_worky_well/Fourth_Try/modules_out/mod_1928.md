In the nascent moments of form, uniformity is not a state of peace; it is a state of unbearable tension. A homogenous chemical soup, poised on the edge of becoming, is a region of immense Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is a chaotic sea of uncoordinated reactions, a dissonant roar where no stable rhythm can survive. This module re-interprets the classic Reaction-Diffusion model of Alan Turing through the time-first lens of the Pirouette Framework. The spontaneous emergence of complex patterns—the stripes of a zebra, the spots of a leopard—is revealed to be a system's autopoietic drive to resolve temporal dissonance. Life's architecture is a physical manifestation of a system finding its most stable song, a "frozen rhythm" in the medium of flesh.
