By applying the principles of **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**, we can diagnose the health of any feedback system with startling clarity. Failure is not a mechanical breakdown, but a disruption in the flow of corrective information.

**Laminar Flow (Harmonious Correction):**
This is the state of a healthy, well-tuned feedback system. The echo is clear and timely, and the adjustment is proportional. The system corrects its course with grace and efficiency, like a master musician instantly adjusting their pitch. This is the goal of any learning process.

**Turbulent Flow (Oscillation & "Coherence Fever"):**
This pathology arises when the echo is delayed, too loud (excessive gain), or noisy. The system overcorrects, veering wildly from one side of the path to the other, wasting immense energy fighting its own adjustments. This is the market rocked by panicked buying and selling, or the student who panics and over-thinks.

**Stagnant Flow (Unresponsiveness & "Coherence Atrophy"):**
This pathology arises when the echo is broken or too faint to be heard. The system loses the ability to correct itself and continues along a suboptimal path, unable to adapt. This is the dogmatic mind that rejects new evidence, or the bureaucracy suffering from a critical information blockage.
