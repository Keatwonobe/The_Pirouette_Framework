The core insight of the old module—that a system follows a gradient—is made formal and universal through the Lagrangian. The **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)** states that a system evolves to maximize its action, `S_p`.

By applying the calculus of variations (the Euler-Lagrange equation) to the Pirouette Lagrangian, we derive the system's natural equations of motion.

$$ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_p}{\partial q} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_p}{\partial \dot{q}} = 0 $$

This equation is the formal expression of the geodesic. It is the mathematical engine that traces the path on the coherence manifold. What was previously modeled with a heuristic algorithm like "Gradient Descent" is now revealed to be a fundamental law of motion. This single dynamic governs the trajectory of a quark, the evolution of a species, or the maturation of an idea. The underlying law is the same; only the coordinates of the manifold change.
