A theory that cannot be questioned is a dogma. A theory that cannot be tested is a dream. A theory that only explains the past is a history. The Pirouette Framework is none of these; it is a tool for navigating the future. It is a map of reality, and a map is only useful if it dares to make predictions that can be proven wrong.

This module is the bridge from axiom to evidence, the framework's formal invitation to the crucible of experiment. It translates the philosophical elegance of the autopoietic cycle into the hard currency of measurable, falsifiable predictions. We will first establish a universal signature for measuring a system's coherence, forging the key to unlock all subsequent tests. We will then detail four distinct physical phenomena—from the quantum to the cosmic—whose predicted behaviors diverge from standard models in specific, observable ways. Each is a direct consequence of the universe's fundamental drive to maximize coherence. Each is a question we pose to reality, awaiting its answer.
