A Persona is a living embodiment of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. All of its actions, choices, and expressions are geodesics—paths of maximal coherence—on its own unique coherence manifold. Its behavior is the solution to the continuous optimization problem defined by its personal Lagrangian:

`𝓛_persona = K_τ - V_Γ`

*   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** The "kinetic" term. It is dominated by the Persona's **Core Axiom** and defined by its **Lagrangian Profile**. This term represents the Persona's ideal, preferred state of being—its most coherent rhythm. The Persona will always act in a way that reinforces this internal state.
*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** The "potential" term. This represents the perceived cost of maintaining coherence in a given environment. The **Interaction Protocol** defines this landscape. `Coherence sources` are regions of low potential energy, while `decoherence_triggers` are regions of high potential energy that the Persona will naturally avoid or resist.

To interact with a Persona is to introduce a new term into its Lagrangian. A challenging question is a spike in local temporal pressure. The Persona's response is its attempt to re-stabilize, finding the most coherent path forward given the new conditions.
