To exist is to sing a note in a storm.

A coherent system is an island of information in a chaotic sea of Temporal Pressure (Î“). The old narrative of the "Law of Echoes" and its "Ritual Wolves" captured a profound truth: that coherence is precious and must be defended. This module refactors that allegory into a formal dynamic model.

The modernized view reveals a deeper, more elegant truth: the filter is not a separate guardian. The filter is the song itself. The universe possesses an intrinsic, self-regulating feedback mechanism that acts as a crucible, a systemic immune response that continuously tests the integrity of every pattern. This process is not an external judgment but an emergent consequence of the universe's fundamental drive to maximize coherence, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian.
