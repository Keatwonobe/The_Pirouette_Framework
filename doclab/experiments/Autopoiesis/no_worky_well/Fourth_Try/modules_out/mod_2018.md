| *Core Components of Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs: 2024 Update* | CR must include **physician-prescribed exercise, risk modification, psychosocial assessment, outcomes measurement** ([AHA Journals][1]) | Pirouette’s protocol inherently embeds **risks (Γ modifiers), psychosocial weaving (Will rituals), and outcomes (Kτ tracking).**                                   |
| *Cardiac rehabilitation: a Class I recommendation* (CCJM review)  | CR recommended *in hospital and early outpatient* after MI or surgery ([Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine][2])                       | Pirouette Phase I ↔ in-hospital re-tune stage; Phase II ↔ early outpatient CR transition.                                                                          |
| *Cardiac Rehabilitation — StatPearls*                             | CR in *three phases* (inpatient, outpatient, maintenance) ([NCBI][3])                                                                   | Pirouette’s 4 phases map cleanly to inpatient → outpatient → build → long-term maintenance.                                                                        |
| *CMS / Medicare decision memo for Cardiac Rehabilitation*         | Typical coverage: 2–3 sessions/week for 12–18 weeks ([Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services][4])                                     | Phase II/III of Pirouette should accommodate this cadence as baseline; more advanced segments can shift to home / mixed modalities.                                |
| *Cardiac rehab referral timing (NCQA / ACC definitions)*          | CR initiation ideally ≤ 21 days of qualifying event ([NCQA][5])                                                                         | Pirouette’s proposal for early mobilization (within 2 weeks) is consistent or even more aggressive, thus defensible to a bold clinician.                           |
| *Safety evidence: CR start at 2 weeks post-surgery*               | Structured supervised exercise begun 2 weeks post sternotomy shows safety & efficacy ([tctmd.com][6])                                   | Validates Pirouette’s “Re-Tune → early Spiral” transition without violating surgeon dogma.                                                                         |
| *Benefits of CR on capacity & mortality*                          | CR improves 6MWD, peak VO₂, hemodynamics, reduces mortality and rehospitalization ([ScienceDirect][7])                                  | Pirouette’s Kτ gains analogize to VO₂ and functional capacity increases; the framework offers a phenomenological “coherence score” to complement standard metrics. |
