The foundational equation of state for any system is the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`):

**𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**

This is not an analogy; it is the physical basis of free energy. It describes the "profitability" of existence for any resonant pattern. We establish a direct, causal chain by defining the core thermodynamic variables as macroscopic manifestations of this dynamic.

*   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** This term represents the system's total internal, ordered, resonant energy. In thermodynamic terms, this corresponds to the system's **Internal Energy (U)**. It is the system's "gross coherence."

*   **Environmental Potential (V_Γ):** This term represents the "cost" of maintaining that coherence against the dissonant, chaotic noise of the environment. As established in `CORE-013`, this pressure is the product of the local temporal temperature and the system's susceptibility to it. This corresponds directly to the **entropic cost (TS)**, or the "Entropy Tax."

Therefore, the Lagrangian is the universe's natural expression of **Helmholtz Free Energy (F)**, the net coherence a system possesses after paying the inevitable cost of its existence under conditions of constant temperature and volume.

**F = U - TS ↔ 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**
