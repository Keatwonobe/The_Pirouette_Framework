| Source                       | Size               | Mitigation                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Photon-shot noise (ESR fit)  | 0.5 mHz rms        | 60 s integration                    |
| Magnetic-field drift         | < 0.2 µT (0.6 kHz) | Lock-in modulation                  |
| Microwave source drift       | 0.1 mHz            | GPS-disciplined OCXO                |
| $T_2$ fit error              | ±1 µs              | 10 × average per point              |
| Systematics (heating, Stark) | < 0.2 mHz          | Alternate NV orientation as control |

Overall expected uncertainty in slope: **±20 %**, sufficient to confirm sign and order-of-magnitude of $\Gamma$.
