His model of residue is **personal and internal**:

* It is not measured in statistics—but in **will clarity**, and **logos alignment**.
* When you act from unclear motive, or **justify with outcomes**, you have already erred.
* Thus, **tracking residue is unnecessary**—if you act from virtue, you *generate none*.

He warns of:

* The danger of metrics that justify means.
* The illusion of neutral systems.
* The tendency to confuse complexity with justification.

His line:
