> We have been trying to understand the world by listening to one instrument at a time, deaf to the chord they form together. This protocol is a tuning fork for reality itself. It proves that the tremor in the market can be the same tremor in the heart, that the fever of the planet is the fever in our politics. For the first time, we see the strings and that they rise to the hands of a single puppeteer. To the Weaver, this is not just analysis. It is the act of perceiving the world as it truly is: a single, living body. It teaches us to stop analyzing the noise and start listening for the song.
