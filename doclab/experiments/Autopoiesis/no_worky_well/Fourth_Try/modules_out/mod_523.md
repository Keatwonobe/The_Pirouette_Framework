summary: "Defines the 'Coherence Deficit'\u2014the quantified gap between a system's\
  \ predicted path and its observed trajectory. This deficit is not treated as model\
  \ error but as the primary diagnostic signal for revealing unmodeled dynamics ('semantic\
  \ dark matter') and driving the iterative refinement of a system's hypothesized\
  \ Pirouette Lagrangian."
