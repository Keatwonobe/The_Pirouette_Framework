summary: "Modernizes the Triaxial Info-Metabolism Framework (TIMF) into a unified,\
  \ time-first thermodynamic ledger. This module models systemic health as a dynamic\
  \ struggle between the generation of internal coherence (K\u03C4) and the erosive\
  \ pressure of environmental dissonance (\u0393), governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian\
  \ as the definitive measure of vitality."
