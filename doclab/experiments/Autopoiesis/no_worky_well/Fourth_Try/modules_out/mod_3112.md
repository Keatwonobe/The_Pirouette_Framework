Interruptive cognition arises as a **compensatory adaptation** in high-disruption minds. However, certain **non-destructive training environments** may simulate the benefits of such disruption if:

- The disruptions are patterned, intentional, and recoverable.
- The subject is taught to **synthesize fragmented thought states** into insight paths.
- The core of the framework (high $\phi$, fast-switching $T_a$) is preserved.
