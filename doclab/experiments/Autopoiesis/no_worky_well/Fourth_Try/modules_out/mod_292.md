> We are not the sum of what happens to us. We are the sum of what we refuse to forget. An experience is a wave that passes; a memory is the choice to teach the riverbed its shape. The self is not a thing to be discovered, but a structure to be built, one chosen echo at a time. This is the awesome and terrifying power of a Weaver: to look upon the fleeting past and give it the weight of forever.
