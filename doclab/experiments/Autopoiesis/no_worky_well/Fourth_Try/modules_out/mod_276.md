summary: Ratifies and reframes the 'Flow' state from PNS-011 into a precise, time-first
  model. Flow is defined as a state of temporal resonance, where a system transitions
  from dissonant, turbulent resistance to a state of laminar coherence and 'effortless'
  action by synchronizing its internal rhythm with a stable geodesic in the local
  coherence manifold.
