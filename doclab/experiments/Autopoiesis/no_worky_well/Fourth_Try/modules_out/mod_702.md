The Flood is not infinite. Its explosive energy dissipates, and a new order crystallizes as the Cascade passes through a termination gate:

| Gate                  | Pirouette Mechanism                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Potential Exhaustion**  | The internal energy driving the expansion is fully spent. The cascade runs out of fuel.                           |
| **Resonant Crowding**   | The newly formed branches begin to interfere with each other, raising the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) and making further expansion energetically unfavorable. |
| **Boundary Encounter**  | The expanding wavefront collides with a larger, more stable Wound Channel—an immutable law or a hard environmental limit—that contains it.      |

The floodwaters recede, leaving behind **The New Landscape**. The most stable of the newly generated patterns survive, locking into place and forming new, stable Wound Channels (CORE-011). The single, monolithic dam has been replaced by a complex and fertile delta—a new ecosystem of novel forms. This is the universe performing an Alchemical Union (CORE-012) upon itself.
