This protocol is a practical application of the Framework's core physics of information. It synthesizes principles from `CORE-013` (Information) and `DYNA-001` (Flow Dynamics).

-   **Information as Laminar Flow (High Coherence, Kτ):** The signal we seek to isolate is a system's coherence. This is "crystalline" information, a stable, low-entropy pattern that has successfully persisted against its environment. It manifests as **Laminar Flow**—a clear, efficient, and predictable current.

-   **Entropy as Turbulent Flow (High Dissonance, Γ):** The noise we seek to filter is the dissonance of the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). This is the direct, physical correlate of what was previously called entropy. A high-entropy segment is a region of chaotic, incommensurate rhythms. It manifests as **Turbulent Flow**—a storm of wasted energy and friction.

The act of filtering is therefore a targeted search for either laminar or turbulent flow, depending on the analytical goal. We are diagnosing the flow state of a system to separate its signal from its static.
