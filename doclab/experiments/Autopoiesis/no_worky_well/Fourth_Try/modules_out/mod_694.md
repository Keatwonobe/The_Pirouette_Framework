> The original insight was correct: Flow is a dance of perfect alignment. The new framework clarifies the nature of this dance. It is not about balancing three separate forces; it is about a single, profound act of timing. The entity ceases to be a swimmer struggling against the river of time and becomes a dancer moving in perfect harmony with its current. Flow is the sublime and simple feeling of being perfectly on beat with the universe.
