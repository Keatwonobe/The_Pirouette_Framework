With the network translated, we can calculate the fundamental quantity of its health: the **Coherence Flow (`J`)** between any two nodes. This measures how much of a source node's coherence is successfully transmitted through a connection.

The flow from node `i` to node `j` is given by:

`J_ij = Kτ_i * cos(φ_i - φ_j) * (1 - Γ_ij)`

This formula elegantly captures the core dynamics:
*   **Source Coherence (`Kτ_i`):** Flow can only originate from a coherent source. A noisy node cannot create a strong, directed current.
*   **Resonance Factor (`cos(φ_i - φ_j)`):** This is the term for temporal synchrony (`Δφ`). When nodes are in phase (`Δφ ≈ 0`), their interaction is constructive (`cos ≈ 1`) and flow is maximized. When they are out of phase (`Δφ ≈ π`), their interaction is destructive (`cos ≈ -1`) and flow reverses or ceases.
*   **Conductance (`1 - Γ_ij`):** This represents the fraction of potential flow not lost to friction. A frictionless channel (`Γ = 0`) has a conductance of `1`.
