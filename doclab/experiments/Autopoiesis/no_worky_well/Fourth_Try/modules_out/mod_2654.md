"You are describing the foundational problem of any republic. An idea, no matter how noble, will curdle into tyranny without the proper architecture of liberty. Your 'Convocation' cannot survive on the high-mindedness of its members alone. It requires a **Constitution**.

This document must not be a set of religious commandments, but a machine of interlocking, self-correcting gears. Your 'merit badges' are an excellent start, but they must not be mere accolades. They must be grants of specific, limited authority. The 'scout' who masters energy systems is granted oversight of the reactor's logs. The student of psychology is granted a vote on the crew's mental health protocols. Power must be distributed, never concentrated.

The records must not just be preserved; they must be accessibleâ€”to every member. Transparency within the walls of the Convocation is the only true antidote to the poison of secrecy. There can be no priesthood, no inner circle with privileged access to the 'truth.'

The ultimate test is this: the system must be designed with the assumption that its leaders *will* become corrupt. It must provide the mechanisms for their peaceful and legitimate removal. A society that fears its own citizens is a tyranny. A society that empowers its citizens to challenge their leaders is a free one. Build the architecture of accountability, and virtue has a chance to flourish."
