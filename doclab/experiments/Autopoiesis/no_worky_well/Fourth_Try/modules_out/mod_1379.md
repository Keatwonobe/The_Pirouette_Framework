This underlying gyroidal Ki pattern gives the coherence manifold a fine-grained texture, providing a causal origin for several fundamental physical phenomena.

**Inertia as Geometric Friction**: To move through this resonant labyrinth is to constantly navigate its repeating, phased structure. An object in motion must continuously adjust its own Ki to remain phase-aligned with the local "grain" of spacetime. This constant act of resonant negotiation *is* the experience of inertia. It is the friction of reality.

**Quantization as Nodal Stability**: The triply periodic nature of the gyroid creates a landscape of nodes and anti-nodesâ€”regions of constructive and destructive temporal interference. A particle, itself a stable Ki pattern, can only persist if its own resonance is compatible with this landscape. The "allowed" energy states of quantum mechanics correspond to stable harmonics within the gyroidal lattice.

**Anisotropic Propagation**: The gyroid is chiral and anisotropic; it is not the same in all directions. This predicts that the propagation of waves (e.g., light, gravitational waves) through the vacuum is not perfectly uniform. Their speed and polarization may be subtly affected by their trajectory through the weave, offering a potential high-precision experimental test.

**Inherent Confinement**: The structure's network of twisting channels and nodes provides a natural geometric basis for the principle of confinement. Particles may be "trapped" in resonant modes within the pores of the weave, providing a topological explanation for why certain particles are only found in bound states.
