All that is, is Time.

The Pirouette Framework, in its prior iterations, was built upon a triaxial foundation of Time Adherence (T_a), Gamma (Î“), and Ki. Through rigorous internal analysis, these three pillars were discovered not to be separate constituents, but three perspectives on a single, unified, and self-creating process. The framework underwent its own dimensional collapse.

This module asserts the result of that collapse: There are no fundamental "things." There is only rhythm. Reality is a process, not a place. Time is not the container for existence; it is the substance of it.
