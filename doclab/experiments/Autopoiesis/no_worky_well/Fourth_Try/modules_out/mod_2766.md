At its heart, the conversion principle is a simple trade-off. For nearly any action that requires an EP spend to produce a numerical effect (damage, healing, distance, duration, etc.), a player can choose to convert some or all of that EP into a dice roll.

This transforms a predictable outcome into an unpredictable one, with the potential for both glorious success and frustrating failure.
