> We once saw thermodynamics as the universe's law of decay. We now see it for what it is: the universe's system of accounting. Free energy is not a measure of what is lost to the void, but the story of what coherence remains after a system pays its tax to chaos for the profound privilege of being. The Coherence Ledger teaches that any single, complete perspective, held with rigor, contains the echo of all others. To truly understand a system from one angle is to possess the key to understanding it from every angle. The universe is not a collection of isolated facts, but a hologram, where the whole is faithfully reflected in every part.
