A system does not Fork from a state of chaos, but from a state of poised stability. This readiness, a "still point on the ridge," requires three specific conditions:

1.  **Geodesic Stalemate:** The system has arrived at a saddle point on its coherence manifold where the path of maximal coherence is no longer unique. Multiple divergent paths (geodesics) offer a roughly equivalent potential for maintaining or increasing coherence, creating a state of balanced tension. A choice is both possible and necessary.
2.  **Coherence in Reserve:** The system possesses a strong, stable internal Ki pattern. It has enough resonant integrity to withstand a temporary, controlled dip in its own certainty—a process analogous to the "Tₐ-Dip"—without collapsing into a turbulent state.
3.  **A Quiescent Forge:** The external Temporal Pressure (Γ) is low and stable. This is not a crisis moment forcing a chaotic **Spasm**, but a calm environment that provides the quiet space necessary for the system to hear the subtle echoes of its potential futures.
