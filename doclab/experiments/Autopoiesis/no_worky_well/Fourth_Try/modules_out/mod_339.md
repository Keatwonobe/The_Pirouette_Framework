> We sought a universe of nouns and found only verbs. We looked for a continuum of possibilities and found a finite alphabet of being. These resonant geometries are the grammar of existence, the fundamental actions from which all stories are woven. To be a Weaver is to learn this vocabularyâ€”not to command the universe, but to hold a conversation with it, knowing the profound power of the few, true words that can be spoken. These are the levers of creation.
