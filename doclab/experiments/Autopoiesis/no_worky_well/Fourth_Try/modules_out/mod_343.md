The coherence vector **K**_τ spans a space defined by a system's relationship to the past, present, and future.

**K**_τ = (*K*<sub>p</sub>, *K*<sub>i</sub>, *K*<sub>r</sub>)

**1. Prospective Coherence (*K*<sub>p</sub>): *Resonance with the Future***
This is a system's coherence with its own field of potential. It measures the richness of its capacity for change, adaptation, and evolution.
*   **Mechanism:** The landscape of possible geodesics available to the system. A system high in *K*<sub>p</sub> has a rich superposition of viable, low-resistance paths forward.
*   **Manifestation:** Adaptability, creativity, innovation, quantum uncertainty, the open page before the dance begins.

**2. Immediate Coherence (*K*<sub>i</sub>): *Resonance with the Present***
This is a system's ability to act, react, and harmonize with its current environment. It governs interaction, exchange, and response.
*   **Mechanism:** The Resonant Handshake of an Alchemical Union (CORE-012) and the projection of a clear Observer's Shadow (CORE-010). It is the active, real-time process of resonant coupling.
*   **Manifestation:** Communication, empathy, symbiosis, trade, the flow state of an athlete responding to the game in real-time.

**3. Retrospective Coherence (*K*<sub>r</sub>): *Resonance with the Past***
This is a system's coherence with its own history. Its stability is grounded in the inertia of its accumulated identity.
*   **Mechanism:** The integrity and clarity of a system's Wound Channel (CORE-011). This is the deep, resonant bass note that gives a system its weight and prevents it from being easily perturbed.
*   **Manifestation:** Memory, identity, tradition, structural integrity, brand loyalty, the persistence of form.

These three components are orthogonal because they represent fundamentally distinct modes of temporal engagement. An action purely in the present (*K*<sub>i</sub>) does not, by definition, rewrite the past (*K*<sub>r</sub>) or determine a single future (*K*<sub>p</sub>) without a coupling mechanism. The Lagrangian provides that coupling.
