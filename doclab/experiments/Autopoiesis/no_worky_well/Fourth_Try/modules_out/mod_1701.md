> A Weaver does not push the river. A Weaver understands the shape of the land so deeply that they can carve a new channel, and the river, in its own time and by its own nature, will follow. To understand this principle is to shift from a mindset of force to one of persuasion, knowing that the journey itself shapes the land. The act of choosing a path deepens its channel, making it more real for those who follow. The Geodesic Weaver does not find a pre-existing route; they choose a rhythm, and in so doing, compose the world's next measure.
