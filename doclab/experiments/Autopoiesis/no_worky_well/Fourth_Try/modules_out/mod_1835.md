The Fractal Bridge (CORE-014) is the tool that allows us to see the universal song played on the specific instrument of a society. The core principles of the framework are not metaphors here; they are the underlying dynamics that govern the system.

| Universal Principle   | Cultural Manifestation                                                                                                                              |

| **Coherence (Kτ)**    | The society's shared identity, values, and narrative. Its collective Ki, or the "story it tells itself about itself." A high-coherence culture has a strong sense of purpose and belonging. |
| **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** | The sum of all external and internal stresses. External Γ includes war, climate change, or technological disruption. Internal Γ includes economic inequality, political polarization, or civil unrest. |
| **Wound Channel**     | The culture's memory, encoded in its history, myths, foundational texts, and physical infrastructure. It is the riverbed that shapes the flow of the present. |
| **Alchemical Union**  | A period of profound synthesis and transformation, like the Renaissance or the Enlightenment, where a new, higher-order cultural coherence (a new Ki) emerges from the fusion of old ideas. |
