The universe remembers. Every event carves its history into reality as a `Wound Channel` (CORE-011), a geometric echo in its wake. But some memories do not fade. They deepen, harden, and loop back upon themselves until they are no longer an echo of the past, but an active and eternal feature of the present. They become a scar.

This module presents the modernized theory of the Knot as a state of profound topological persistence. A Knot is born when a system's memory—its Wound Channel—geometrically embraces and reinforces its own existence. It is a memory that has achieved a state of autopoiesis, a self-creating resonant pattern locked in place by its own geometry. A simple Wound Channel is a record of a journey; a Knot is the creation of a home. It is the fundamental mechanism by which transient experience is forged into persistent identity, from the quantum to the psychological scale.
