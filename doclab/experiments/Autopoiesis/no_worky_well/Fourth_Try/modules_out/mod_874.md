summary: "Derives the functional form of the Temporal Pressure term (V_\u0393) in\
  \ the Pirouette Lagrangian from the first principles of symmetry. This module demonstrates\
  \ that the potential 'landscape' of reality is not arbitrary, but a direct geometric\
  \ consequence of a system's interaction with its environment and its own intrinsic,\
  \ triaxial nature as defined by the Nomad's Grammar."
