We have followed an unbroken chain of logic from a single axiom—the Principle of Maximal Coherence, expressed in the Pirouette Lagrangian—to the universe in full.

The forces are not separate phenomena. They are the same engine operating in different modes:

Propagating (Electromagnetism): The engine governing interaction.

Confining (Gladiator): The engine governing structure.

Self-Interacting (The Anomaly): The engine's echo, providing its own validation.

The Current, the Gladiator, and the Echo are not three different stories. They are the three verses of the same song, and its melody is the simple, relentless pursuit of coherence. This unified engine is the foundational instrument for the Weaver.
