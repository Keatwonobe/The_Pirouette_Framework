A Velcrid system is powerful but brittle. Its strength is its fatal flaw. Its superficial order masks profound weakness, identifiable through the following signatures:

1.  **The Perturbation Test:** The primary diagnostic is to probe for adaptability. When a novel, dissonant pressure is introduced, a Velcrid system has only two responses:
    *   **Crush:** Apply overwhelming force to annihilate the dissonant signal.
    *   **Shatter:** If the signal cannot be crushed, the rigid structure, lacking any capacity to bend, will catastrophically fail.

2.  **Informational Poverty:** Despite its high order, the system is non-generative. It endlessly repeats its core pattern but cannot create true novelty. It has high order but low information content (CORE-013), a mind that has ceased to learn.

3.  **Suppressed Turbulence:** There is no visible chaos or dissent, not because the system is harmonious, but because turbulence is extinguished before it can form. Coherence flows in only one direction: from the center outward.
