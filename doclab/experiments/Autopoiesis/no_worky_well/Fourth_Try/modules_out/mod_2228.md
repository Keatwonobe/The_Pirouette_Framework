This module mandates the creation of a suite of predictive dashboards that serve as the primary interface between the mathematical theory and the experimental (XXP) validation.

1. The Confinement Dashboard (from MATH-006):

Input: Experimental data from particle accelerators (e.g., hadron spectroscopy).

Prediction: The framework predicts that the mass-squared of families of bound states (like mesons) should fall on straight lines ("Regge trajectories") when plotted against their angular momentum. The slope of these lines is determined by the b parameter in the V_eff(r) = a/r + b*r potential.

Falsification: The theory is falsified if these trajectories are not linear or if the required b parameter is inconsistent across different families of particles.

2. The Coherence Stability Dashboard (from MATH-008):

Input: Time-series data from rhythmic systems (e.g., pulsar timing arrays, seismic data, protein folding dynamics).

Prediction: Using the Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem, we can calculate the system's T_a. The theory predicts that the system will undergo a phase transition (i.e., lose its stable rhythm) when the integrated environmental noise reaches a critical threshold determined by its T_a.

Falsification: The theory is falsified if a system's breakdown point does not correlate with the predictions made from its measured T_a and the environmental noise spectrum.

3. The Observer Back-Action Dashboard (from MATH-009):

Input: Data from quantum optics or condensed matter experiments where observation strength (kappa) can be precisely controlled.

Prediction: The Information-Coherence Inequality I(obs; phi) * Delta T_a >= C predicts a specific, non-linear trade-off curve between the information gained and the coherence lost.

Falsification: The theory is falsified if experimental data shows that one can gain more information for a given amount of disturbance than the inequality allows.
