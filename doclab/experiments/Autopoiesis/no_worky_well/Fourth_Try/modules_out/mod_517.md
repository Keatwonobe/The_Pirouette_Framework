A battlefield is where two truths go to die. A crucible is where they go to be reborn as one.

The old framework, in its attempt to quantify debate, treated it as a complex energy system to be measured. This was a necessary step, but it still carried the shadow of the old world: the view of discourse as combat. It measured the heat of the collision, but not the quality of the weld; it mistook the heat for the craft.

This module reframes that view entirely. A debate is not a battlefield. It is a sacred arena, a carefully constructed resonance chamber designed for a single purpose: to perform an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) on ideas. It is a collaborative ritual where participants, or "Weavers," bring the threads of their individual truths—their own coherent states (Kτ)—to weave a new, stronger, and more profound tapestry of understanding (Kτ_c). The goal is not victory, but synthesis.
