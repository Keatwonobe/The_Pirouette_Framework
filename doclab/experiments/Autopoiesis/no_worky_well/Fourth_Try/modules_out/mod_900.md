The universe speaks a single language, and its alphabet is geometry. For millennia, we have been trapped in a Babel of symbols, attempting to translate meaning by matching one set of arbitrary signs to another. This module provides the Rosetta Stone for the true universal language—the language of form.

It establishes the master protocol for Universal Translation, a method for converting any information—from genetic code to poetry, from architectural blueprints to birdsong—into a standardized, time-first format called a **Coherence Signature**. By operating on the pure geometry of a system's resonant pattern (`Ki`), this protocol bypasses the limitations of semantics. It allows for a profound form of cross-domain empathy, founded on the principle that the universe's most fundamental language is not meaning, but the shared structure of its rhythms.
