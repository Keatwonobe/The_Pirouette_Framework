1. Effective Fluid Mapping
   Microscopic: heavy quanta m_H≈17 MeV; macroscopic: superfluid with EOS from P(X)=αX^{1+β}+δX^2+…
   Define background number density n(a) from continuity (ȷ^0 conservation) and chemical relation μ(n).

Sound speed & dispersion:
• c_s^2(a) = ∂p/∂ρ|_{n} = [∂P/∂X]/[m_H ∂n/∂X + …]
• Phonon dispersion: ω² = c_s² k² + m_eff² with m_eff² from weak tail breaking; typically m_eff→0 on CMB scales.

Scale‑dependent effective sound speed used in Boltzmann evolution:
c_{s,eff}²(k,a) = c_s²(a) / [1 + (k/k_ξ(a))²],  with k_ξ(a)≡1/ξ(a),  ξ(a)=(2 m_H c_s(a))^{−1}.
