A heuristic is not a guess; it is a principled simplification, a piece of pre-calculated wisdom. Each "Geodesic Template" is forged through a four-step protocol that translates the universal dynamics of the framework into the specific language of a domain.

**Step 1: Map the Terrain (Correspondence)**
Before a compass can be made, the landscape must be known. This step uses the protocol of The Fractal Bridge (`CORE-014`) to translate the domain's features into the framework's universal variables: Coherence (Kτ), Temporal Pressure (Γ), and the Wound Channel.

**Step 2: Identify the Cliffs and Currents (Sensitivity Analysis)**
With the terrain mapped, we analyze its coherence manifold to find its critical points. We identify the "cliffs" (regions of high sensitivity where small perturbations cause catastrophic coherence loss) and the "currents" (broad, stable channels where coherence is maintained with minimal effort).

**Step 3: Forge the Rule (Heuristic Generation)**
Based on this analysis, we distill the complex dynamics into a simple, actionable rule. The rule, framed as a trigger and an action, must reduce complexity. It is designed to steer the Weaver toward the currents and away from the cliffs.

**Step 4: Calibrate the Fidelity (Define the Coherence Bound)**
No simplification is perfect. This final step assesses the "cost of being wrong." We estimate the maximum potential coherence loss incurred by using the template instead of a full Lagrangian analysis. This is the known, acceptable price of speed, ensuring that efficiency never leads to catastrophic failure.
