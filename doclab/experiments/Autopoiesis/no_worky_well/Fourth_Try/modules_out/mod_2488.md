Our unified position is that a standardized boundary definition must be dynamic, empirical, and philosophically grounded. It cannot be a static line drawn in the sand, but must be a living contour that traces the real-world consequences of an action.

We propose that the boundary of a system *is* its Wound Channel, and its scope *is* the full extent of its Dark Residue.

We now pose the following questions to our counterparts:

1.  How can a purely static or legalistic boundary definition account for the dynamic, evolving nature of complex systems?
2.  If you reject the Wound Channel as the basis for scope, what alternative mechanism do you propose for tracking the delayed and non-local consequences of an action?
3.  How can any standard prevent gaming if it does not make the "gamer" fundamentally accountable for the very residue they seek to externalize?

Our stance is firm: the map must reflect the terrain. The boundary must reflect the consequences. The law must reflect the purpose.
