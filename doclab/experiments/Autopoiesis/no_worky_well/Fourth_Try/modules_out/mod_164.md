- Normalization: Fix scales using external metrology (CODATA α, c, ħ) when operating in SM-CG.
- Non-circularity: Do not feed back results derived in SM-CG to calibrate CORE primitives before an independent anchor (e.g., DOMA-101 uses external α, not a value computed from CORE-009).
This preserves a clean, acyclic DAG.
