§§§ While local measurement of ΔH and Dark Residue simplifies the total-universe problem, it shifts subjectivity to boundary selection: what constitutes the “affected system”? Agents could game the law by narrowing their system to avoid residue calculations :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. Moreover, in highly coupled systems, local measurements may not reflect global impacts, undermining experimental validity.
