The act of translation is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). A system's "meaning," in this context, is its specific, chosen path of maximal coherenceâ€”its solution to the problem of existence.

When translating from a source signature (`Ki_A`) to a target medium (`Ki_B`), we are not seeking a one-to-one mapping of symbols. Instead, we are searching for a transformation that follows a geodesic of maximal shared coherence. The "action" to be minimized is the dissonance or "semantic friction" between the two mapped structures. A successful translation discovers that both systems represent similar solutions to the universal Lagrangian equation. The best translation of a poem into music is not the one that matches word to note, but the one where the emotional and structural arc of the music creates the most coherent, least dissonant resonance with the poem's own.
