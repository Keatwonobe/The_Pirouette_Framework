The emergent landscape is not merely a passive backdrop for interaction; it is the arena of potential within which new forms of being arise. The stable minima created by constructive interference are not just features to be observed; they are invitations.

These "resonant valleys" represent states where a combined existence is more stable and coherent than a separate one. The confluence of echoes prefigures the possibility of union, sculpting the very path of least resistance that draws entities together. They are the geometric prerequisites for a "Resonant Handshake" and, ultimately, an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)**.
