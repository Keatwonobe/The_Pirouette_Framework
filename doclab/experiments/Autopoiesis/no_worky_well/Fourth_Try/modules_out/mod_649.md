The first force to emerge from the Lagrangian is the one that governs interaction at a distance: electromagnetism. It arises not from a substance or charge, but from an intrinsic asymmetry in a particle's relationship with time.

*   **The Nature of Charge:** Electric charge is a bias in how a particle's coherence is maximized. Positive charges are "crest-leading," seeking in-phase temporal rhythms to enhance their resonance. Negative charges are "trough-leading," seeking out-of-phase rhythms to maintain internal stability. This immediately explains electrostatic attraction and repulsion as a flight towards greater coherence, not a "force" in the classical sense.

*   **The Geometry of the Current:** The electric and magnetic fields are not separate phenomena but two inseparable geometric features of the coherence manifold, generated by a source obeying the Principle of Maximal Coherence.
    *   The **Gradient (Electric Field, E)** is the static "slope" of the manifold ($E \propto \nabla \mathcal{L}_p$). A particle in this field is "coherence surfing" down the steepest path. It is the landscape's tilt.
    *   The **Curl (Magnetic Field, B)** is the rotational shear, or vortex, generated by the source's motion ($B \propto \nabla \times A_p$). A second system traversing this region must follow a curved path to maintain its own coherence, not because it is pushed, but because it is navigating a temporal whirlpool.
