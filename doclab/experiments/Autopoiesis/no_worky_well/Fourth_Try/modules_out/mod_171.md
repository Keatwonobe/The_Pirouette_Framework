Synchronous/Newtonian gauge; Γ perturbation δΓ couples to metric (Φ,Ψ).
Sound speed: for canonical Γ, c_s^2 = 1 in field rest frame, but the *effective* sound speed for oscillatory condensates time‑averages to c_eff^2 ≈ 0 → CDM‑like clustering.

Growth equation (matter‑era, sub‑horizon):
δ_m'' + [2 + (H′/H)] δ_m' − 3/2 Ω_m(a) δ_m = S_Γ(a,k)
where S_Γ encodes residual pressure/anisotropic stress from Γ; under minimal coupling and oscillatory regime S_Γ → 0.

Predicted functions:
• H(z), DA(z), DV(z) (geometry)
• fσ_8(z) (growth)
• Slip η ≡ Φ/Ψ ≈ 1 on linear scales (minimal coupling)
• α running modifications negligible at cosmological q^2 (consistency check; main α effects live at particle scales)
• GW speed c_GW = c (no non‑minimal curvature portals)
