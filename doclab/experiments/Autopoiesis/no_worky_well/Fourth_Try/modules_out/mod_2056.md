In the modern framework, a flow channel is a geodesic—a path of least action—through the coherence manifold. It is a stable, predictable current in the river of time.

Flow Channels: These are regions where the gradient of temporal pressure is smooth and low. An entity moving along such a path experiences time in a consistent, non-turbulent manner.

Temporal Resonance Condition: An entity enters flow when its internal clock—the rhythm of its perception-action cycle—achieves resonance with the rhythm of the flow channel. The phase difference between the agent and its environment approaches zero (Δτ≈0). The agent is no longer fighting the current; it is the current.
