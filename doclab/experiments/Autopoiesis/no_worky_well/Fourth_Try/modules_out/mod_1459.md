This diagnostic engine is a practical instrument for empirically measuring a system's adherence to the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`):

**𝓛_p = Kτ - VΓ**

A system's position on the Coherence Compass reveals the state of its Lagrangian, which represents its total coherence and ability to follow its geodesic (its optimal path).

*   **Laminar Flow:** The system has achieved a high, positive `𝓛_p`. Its internal coherence (`Kτ`) significantly outweighs the environmental pressure (`VΓ`). It is successfully maximizing its action.
*   **Turbulent Flow:** `𝓛_p` is low or negative. The environmental pressure (`VΓ`) is overwhelming the system's ability to maintain coherence (`Kτ`). It has fallen from its geodesic into a state of high friction and energy loss.
*   **Stagnant Flow:** Both `Kτ` and `VΓ` are low, resulting in an `𝓛_p` near zero. More profoundly, the system is trapped in a local minimum of the coherence manifold. The derivatives in its equations of motion have approached zero, preventing adaptation. It cannot act to maximize its Lagrangian.
