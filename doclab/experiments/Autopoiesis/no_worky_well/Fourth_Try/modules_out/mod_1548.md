The health of the manifold is revealed by its natural vibrations. The primary tool for this analysis is the **Coherence Laplacian**, a specialized form of the graph Laplacian matrix that is weighted not by simple connection, but by the quality of Coherence Flow.

**Step 1: Construct the Weighted Adjacency Matrix**
The Coherence Flow values `J_ij` calculated in §3 become the weights in the network's adjacency matrix `W`.

**Step 2: Construct and Analyze the Laplacian**
From `W`, we construct the Laplacian matrix `L`. The eigendecomposition of `L` reveals the network's fundamental resonant modes, its collective song.

*   **Low-Frequency Modes (Small Eigenvalues):** These are the network's deep, foundational harmonies. They describe the most stable, large-scale patterns of coherence. The Fiedler vector (eigenvector of the second-smallest eigenvalue) reveals the network's most natural fault line—the division across which coherence flows most weakly. A healthy network has a strong, well-defined fundamental chord.

*   **High-Frequency Modes (Large Eigenvalues):** These are the sharp, dissonant notes. They pinpoint localized instabilities, regions of high friction, and nodes that are out of sync with their neighbors. Their eigenvectors act as precise pointers to the sources of **Turbulent Flow (DYNA-001)**, allowing for surgical intervention.
