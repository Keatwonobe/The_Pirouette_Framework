The world itself is the oldest and most powerful entity a character will ever encounter. It is not a static backdrop for adventure, but an active, often hostile, participant in the story. This module provides the rules for treating the environment as a character with its own will, its own actions, and its own resources, and introduces the final form of combat: the struggle for survival.
