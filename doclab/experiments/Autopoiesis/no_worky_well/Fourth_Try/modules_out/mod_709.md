A Shell is the arena built by the Gladiator Force. As described in `CORE-008`, this force arises from a non-linear feedback loop where a system's own intense resonance dramatically increases the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). A Shell forms when this feedback loop becomes self-containing, creating a deep "coherence well" in the landscape.

The boundary is the steep wall of this well—a dynamic gradient in Temporal Pressure that holds the ambient chaos of the external environment at bay.
*   **The Interior:** Inside the boundary, the system enjoys a protected arena of high, stable internal coherence (`K_τ`), allowing it to sustain a complex, high-fidelity `Ki` pattern.
*   **The Exterior:** Outside the boundary lies the untamed Temporal Forge (`CORE-003`), the chaotic sum of all other rhythms.
*   **The Boundary:** The interface between the two, where the cost of maintaining coherence rises sharply, making it energetically prohibitive for the internal pattern to leak out or for external dissonance to invade.

An atom's electron shells, a cell's membrane, and a planet's magnetosphere are all such arenas, forged at different scales by the same fundamental principle of self-confinement.
