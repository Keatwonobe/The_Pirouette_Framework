How does one map a river's course from a handful of water? The old framework sought to estimate discrete parameters from sparse data, an act akin to guessing the river's depth from the color of a single stone. This module replaces that outdated practice with a more profound approach: The Surveyor's Art.

This is a protocol for inferring the *shape* of the underlying coherence manifold from a few scattered points. We assume that any data point is a snapshot of a system following its natural path of maximal coherence (its geodesic). Therefore, even the sparest of data is not a random sample, but a clueâ€”a footprint left on a hidden landscape. Our task is to become surveyors of this invisible terrain, moving from simple estimation to a rich, qualitative *diagnosis* of the system's health, its struggle, and its trajectory.
