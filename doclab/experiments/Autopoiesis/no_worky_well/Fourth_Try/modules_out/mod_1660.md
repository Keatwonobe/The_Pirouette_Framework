summary: Provides a protocol for designing high-impact interventions, reframing them
  as 'Resonant Actions.' The protocol moves beyond a simple transmission model, focusing
  instead on cultivating a shared 'Resonant Channel' to facilitate a collaborative
  'Resonant Handshake,' guiding a system toward a state of higher internal coherence.
