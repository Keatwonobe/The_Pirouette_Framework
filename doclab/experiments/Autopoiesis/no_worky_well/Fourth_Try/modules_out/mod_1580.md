summary: "Refactors planning from a static document into a dynamic process of projecting\
  \ a proposed geodesic\u2014a path of maximal coherence\u2014into the future. Assesses\
  \ plan viability by modeling it as a system governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian\
  \ and diagnoses its execution using Flow Dynamics."
