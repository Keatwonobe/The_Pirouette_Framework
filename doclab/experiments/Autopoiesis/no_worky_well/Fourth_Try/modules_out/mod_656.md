This module completes the modernization of `PPS-034`, providing the causal mechanism for relativistic phenomena from a time-first foundation. It reframes our understanding of what was formerly called Time Adherence (Tₐ), establishing its successor concept, **Temporal Coherence (T₀)**, not as a fundamental parameter but as a crucial diagnostic property—the measure of a system's resonant integrity.

In this formulation, effects like time dilation are not distortions imposed by a background spacetime. They are the emergent, autopoietic strategies a system employs to preserve its own coherence. The slowing of a clock at speed or in a deep gravity well is the audible result of that system paying the energetic cost of its own passage, adapting its internal rhythm to endure the stresses of motion and existence.
