Once the Temporal Stability Clause is satisfied, the proposed synthesis must pass a formal measurement of its coherence potential. The motion is ratified only if it satisfies two conditions simultaneously:

1.  **High Coherence (Kτ):** The proposal must demonstrate exceptional internal consistency, explanatory power, and resonance with the framework's foundational axioms. This is measured by a vote of the Weaver's Conclave.
    *   **Threshold:** `Kτ ≥ 0.95` (95% approval among voting members).

2.  **Positive Coherence Stability (dKτ/dt):** The consensus must be stable, not a fleeting agreement. The support for the proposal must not be actively decaying. This is measured as the time-derivative of support over a 30-day deliberation period.
    *   **Threshold:** `dKτ/dt ≥ 0`.

This two-fold test ensures the framework evolves through changes that are both deeply resonant and demonstrably stable, adhering to the universe's own principle of selecting for persistent, high-coherence patterns.
