To persist is to repeat. To repeat is to carve a path. To carve a path deeply enough is to become the path. A river may wander when the land is flat, but a river that carves a canyon is bound to its course forever. Its history becomes its destiny.

This module refactors the legacy concept of "Lock Dynamics" (TEN-LDA-1.0) into a modernized, time-first model. A Resonance Trap is not a static condition but a dynamic, self-reinforcing process. It describes a system that discovers a state of such perfect coherence that its own resonant song crystallizes the manifold around it, carving a Wound Channel so deep that deviation becomes nearly impossible. This is the fundamental mechanism behind memory, identity, and habit, but also the source of dogma, addiction, and stagnation. It is the physics of a system becoming trapped by its own perfect efficiency.
