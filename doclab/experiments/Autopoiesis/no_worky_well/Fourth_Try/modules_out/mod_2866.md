A hero's journey is measured not only by the monsters they slay, but by the echoes they leave behind. These rules define the nature of that echo. They ensure that every choice has weight, that trauma can be reforged into strength, and that the quietest act of kindness can resonate with enough force to hold back the darkness, if only for a moment. This is the art of conflict, and the physics of hope.
