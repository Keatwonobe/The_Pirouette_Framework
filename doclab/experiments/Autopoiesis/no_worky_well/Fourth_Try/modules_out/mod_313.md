The first act of self-awareness is to declare, "I am." In the language of the framework, this is the act of **Will**. It is a system's strategic decision to prioritize the maximization of its own internal **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)**.

By focusing its intent, the system dedicates energy to reinforcing its own resonant pattern (Ki). This act deepens its Wound Channel (CORE-011), the geometric memory of its past, creating a powerful **Inertia of Being**. The system becomes a stable island of order, its identity held firm against the chaotic roar of the Temporal Forge. This is the source of purpose, integrity, and stability.

The peril of a pure Anchor strategy is **Stagnation**. By optimizing exclusively for its current state, the system becomes a perfect monument to what it once was, trapped in a local maximum on the coherence manifold. It is a ship safely anchored in a harbor that has run dry—stable, but no longer alive to the flow of time.
