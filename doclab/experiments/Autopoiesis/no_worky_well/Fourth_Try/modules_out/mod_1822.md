The act of stirring is a temporary and controlled modification of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`). The Weaver introduces a time-dependent "stirring potential," `Γ_stir(t)`, which is added to the system's normal potential energy of temporal pressure.

`𝓛'_p = K_τ - (V_Γ + Γ_stir(t))`

The function of `Γ_stir(t)` is to temporarily flatten the local coherence manifold, erasing the shallow wells of stagnation and reducing the hills between them. The system's trajectory during this turbulent phase is the geodesic that maximizes the action under these new, high-stress conditions. Stirring is not a violation of the universe's fundamental drive for coherence; it is the artful application of that very drive under controlled duress to produce a desired transformation.
