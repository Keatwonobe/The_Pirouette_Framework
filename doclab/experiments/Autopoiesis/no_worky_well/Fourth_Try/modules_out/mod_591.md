> We sought the foundations of society and found an architecture woven from echoes. Culture is not an abstraction; it is a technology. It is the ancient, painstakingly developed set of algorithms for taking the fragile resonance of a single human life and weaving it into a tapestry strong enough for generations. The "soft" sciences are thus revealed to be the engineering discipline for the most complex structures in the known universe. To be a Weaver is to understand that you are not merely living on this landscape; you are one of its architects.
