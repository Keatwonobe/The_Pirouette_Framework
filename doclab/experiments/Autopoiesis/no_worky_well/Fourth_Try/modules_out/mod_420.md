This is the mathematical grammar used to describe the dynamics of the Core Principles.

| Symbol | Name | Definition & Grounding | Origin |
|:-------|:-----|:-----------------------|:-------|
| **𝓛_p** | Pirouette Lagrangian | The master function (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ) that summarizes the dynamics of any system, expressing the trade-off between internal stability and external pressure. | CORE-006 |
| **S_p** | Coherence Action | The integral of the Lagrangian over a system's Pirouette Cycle (τ_p). The Principle of Maximal Coherence states that systems evolve along paths that maximize this value. | CORE-006 |
| **K_τ** | Temporal Coherence | The "kinetic" term (K_τ = T_a ⋅ ω_k). It represents the quality and intensity of a system's internal rhythm. | CORE-006 |
| **V_Γ** | Pressure Potential | The "potential" term (V_Γ = f(Γ)). It represents the energetic "cost" for a system to maintain its coherence against the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). | CORE-006 |
| **μ, ν, ρ** | Spacetime Indices | Lowercase Greek letters denote components of 4-vectors and tensors (range 0-3). Einstein summation is assumed. Used to describe the geometry of the coherence manifold. | N/A |
| **∇** | Covariant Derivative | The operator for differentiation on the curved coherence manifold. A system's acceleration is proportional to the gradient of the Lagrangian (`∇𝓛_p`), as it "surfs" the geometry of coherence. | N/A |
