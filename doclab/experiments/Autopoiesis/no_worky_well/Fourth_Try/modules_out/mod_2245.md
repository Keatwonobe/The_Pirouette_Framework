* **“Time is a particle.”** No. We quantize (\Gamma(x)), a scalar field over spacetime. Its quanta are *pressurons*, not quanta of the time coordinate.
* **Identifying coherons with electrons.** Scalars can’t reproduce fermionic spin/statistics; add spinor fields or treat coherons as a distinct sector.
* **Anchoring (g) to (\alpha) without a UV reason.** Leave (g) free or derive it from a symmetry-breaking/matching argument.
* **Ignoring curvature/boundaries.** On curved backgrounds, use covariant Green functions and state choices.
