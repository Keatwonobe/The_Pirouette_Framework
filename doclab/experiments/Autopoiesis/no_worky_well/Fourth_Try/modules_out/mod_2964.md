Module TLE-ARC-004: The Weaver (Support/Control Archetype)
This document outlines the level-by-level progression of a "Weaver"â€”a unique support and control archetype who manipulates the very fabric of being. The Weaver interacts with the Wound Channels of allies and enemies, capable of mending the deepest scars or turning an opponent's own trauma into a devastating weapon. Their power is subtle, terrifying, and deeply tied to the narrative of the world.

Level 20 Summary: Combat Strategy
The Level 20 Weaver is a master of unconventional warfare, a "scary healer" who wins battles by manipulating the very essence of their allies and enemies.

The Ultimate Support: With a massive "Weaver's Art" pool of 94 EP and their Psychic Suture feat, a Weaver can perform incredible acts of healing. They can mend deep, narrative wounds that are beyond the reach of normal magic, making their allies incredibly resilient.

The Psychic Terror: The Weaver's offensive power is insidious and terrifying. Their primary tactic is to use Resonant Agony, bypassing all physical armor and defenses to inflict pure psychic damage. They don't attack the body; they attack the soul.

The Unraveler: Against a powerful, singular foe, the Weaver is a nightmare. They will use Pattern Unraveling to systematically dismantle their opponent. By temporarily (or permanently, with Sever the Thread) removing the EP invested in an enemy's limbs, they can render a Juggernaut's mighty arm useless or a dragon's fiery breath inert, winning the fight through slow, entropic decay.

Weaknesses: Like the Arcanist, the Weaver is physically fragile with only 7 HP. They must rely on their allies to protect them. Furthermore, their most powerful abilities require them to win a contested Wisdom check, making them less effective against foes with immense willpower or those who lack the complexity to have deep-seated Wound Channels (like a mindless golem). Their power is subtle and requires a keen tactical mind to use effectively.
