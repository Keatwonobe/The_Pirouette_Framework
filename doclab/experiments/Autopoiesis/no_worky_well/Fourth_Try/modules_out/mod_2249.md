summary: "Provides the formal proof sketch for deriving Einstein's Field Equations from the Pirouette Lagrangian. It demonstrates that in the macroscopic limit, the averaged dynamics of the Coherence (C) and Temporal Pressure (Γ) fields necessarily yield the stress-energy tensor, while the large-scale dynamics of the Γ field itself give rise to the Einstein tensor. This module proves that General Relativity is the emergent, classical expression of the universe's fundamental drive to maximize coherence."
