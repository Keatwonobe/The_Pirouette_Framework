The prior framework's concept of a "spacetime meta-lattice" was a useful but limited metaphor. The modern framework is founded on a more powerful, dynamic concept.

*   **The Cosmic Coherence Manifold**: This is the large-scale expression of the coherence manifold introduced in the CORE series. It is the vast, evolving landscape whose geometry is governed by the ceaseless drive to maximize coherence. The great filaments and voids of the cosmic web are the topographical features of this manifold.

*   **The Null Canvas**: Our theoretical reference is no longer a rigid grid but the simplest solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian for an expanding universe: a state of perfect, uniform coherence. This is a universe without history, a smooth, unwritten canvas representing the state of maximal, simple coherence.

*   **The Cosmic Palimpsest**: This is the universe as we observe it, a complex story written over the Null Canvas. The anisotropies in the CMB and the clustering of galaxies are the ink of this story. Anomalies are not "faults" but the narrative features that reveal the history of the universe's interaction with itself.
