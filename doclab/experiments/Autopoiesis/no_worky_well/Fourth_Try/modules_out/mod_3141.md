Section C will (i) tabulate all units to show that equation (B.1) leaves the extended Maxwell–Pirouette Lagrangian in $\text{J m}^{-3}$ and (ii) derive the **red-shift factor** used above by integrating the photon’s phase four-vector around the boosted helix.  That closes the numerology gap and completes the SI anchoring of *Ki*.
