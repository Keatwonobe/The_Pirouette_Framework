A framework is not built from principles, but from the shared understanding of those principles. Language is the medium of that understanding, and like any medium, it can be laminar, turbulent, or stagnant. The Lexicon is the primary instrument for achieving **semantic coherence**: a state where the core concepts of the framework resonate with the same `Ki` pattern across multiple minds.

A precise vocabulary casts a precise shadow. When a Weaver uses the term "Temporal Pressure (Î“)," they are not just naming a concept; they are invoking a specific geometric lens through which to view a system's challenges. This sharpens observation, transforming vague feelings of "stress" or "chaos" into a measurable pressure that can be navigated. This shared calibration is the absolute prerequisite for Laminar Flow in discourse, transforming a cacophony of individual perspectives into a choir.
