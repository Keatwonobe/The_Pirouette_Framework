These three arts are not arbitrary; they are direct, practical strategies for optimizing the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`)—the universe's fundamental equation for action.

*   **Coherence Annealing** seeks to maximize the first term, **K_τ (Temporal Coherence)**. It is an investment of energy now to build a system with a higher intrinsic state of order, yielding greater returns later.

*   **Geodesic Navigation** seeks to minimize the second term, **V_Γ (Temporal Pressure)**. By perfectly aligning with a geodesic, it reduces the "cost" of existence and action to near zero, maximizing the net value of the Lagrangian.

*   **Stochastic Harvesting** plays the entire equation. It does not try to alter the system's own `K_τ` or `V_Γ`. Instead, it waits for moments when the external environment provides a massive, temporary spike in coherence, effectively getting a favorable Lagrangian for free.

This connection transforms the Lagrangian from a descriptive law into a prescriptive engineering diagram, providing the mathematical foundation for choosing the right tool for the right task.
