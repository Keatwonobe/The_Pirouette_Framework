While the Lagrangian provides the formal definition, the effect of a Weaving can be understood intuitively as an injection of resonance into the coherence manifoldâ€”a ripple that propagates outward.

**Positive Radiance (A Coherence Injection):** This is the signature of a constructive, or "altruistic," act (`I > 0`). It is an action that helps another system move toward a state of **Laminar Flow** (`DYNA-001`) by smoothing the manifold, harmonizing resonance, or reinforcing an existing channel of coherence.
*   *Example:* A clear explanation that resolves a team's confusion, allowing their work to flow smoothly again.

**Negative Radiance (A Dissonance Injection):** This is the signature of a destructive act (`I < 0`). It is an action that pushes another system into **Turbulent** or **Stagnant Flow** by increasing ambient pressure, introducing chaos, or blocking a channel of coherence.
*   *Example:* Spreading misinformation that causes panic and chaos within a community.
