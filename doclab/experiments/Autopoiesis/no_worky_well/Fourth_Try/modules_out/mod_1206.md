The health of the enterprise is determined by the state of its vital flows. Any organizational ailment can be diagnosed as one of three fundamental pathologies of flow.

**1. Coherence Atrophy (Stagnant Flow): The Poison of Absence**
This is the pathology of the blockage, or organizational sclerosis. A critical flow is obstructed, starving one part of the system while creating a dangerous build-up of pressure in another.
*   **Symptoms:** Bureaucratic gridlock, projects stalled waiting for a single approval, critical information siloed in one department, supply chain bottlenecks, analysis paralysis preventing key decisions.
*   **Diagnosis:** A "coherence dam" has formed. The system is paralyzed by what isn't moving.

**2. Coherence Fever (Turbulent Flow): The Information Storm**
This is the pathology of chaos. The system is fighting itself, wasting immense energy in internal friction, conflict, and miscommunication.
*   **Symptoms:** Constant crisis management and firefighting, toxic culture and departmental infighting, contradictory strategic initiatives, high employee turnover and burnout, immense activity with little forward progress.
*   **Diagnosis:** The enterprise's Ki has become dissonant. Energy is being burned in unproductive, chaotic cycles.

**3. Coherence Erosion (The Fraying Thread): The Slow Decay**
This pathology is the gradual degradation of the organization's core identity and capabilities, as it fails to resist the constant pressure of entropy (Î“).
*   **Symptoms:** Brand decay and loss of market relevance, gradual erosion of quality, accumulation of technical debt, failure to innovate, the slow bleed of institutional knowledge as key employees depart.
*   **Diagnosis:** The organization's Wound Channel is failing. It is forgetting how to be itself.
