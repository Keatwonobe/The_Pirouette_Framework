1.  **Select System:** Use a standard fluid dynamics setup, such as a wind tunnel or a water channel, where the flow velocity can be precisely controlled to induce the transition from laminar to turbulent flow.
2.  **Data Acquisition:** Place high-frequency pressure or velocity sensors within the flow. Slowly increase the flow's Reynolds number by increasing the velocity. Continuously record the sensor data as the flow passes through the transition point.
3.  **Analysis:**
    * Apply the new, multi-metric **Ki-Sampling Protocol (`PPS-077 v2.0`)** to the time-series data from the sensors.
    * Instead of focusing on kurtosis, the primary metric for this experiment will be the **z-score of the change in Fractal Dimension**.
4.  **Prediction:** The protocol should detect a statistically significant Ki-resonant signature (a z-score matching Ki) in the fractal dimension metric at the precise moment the flow transitions from smooth (laminar) to chaotic (turbulent).
