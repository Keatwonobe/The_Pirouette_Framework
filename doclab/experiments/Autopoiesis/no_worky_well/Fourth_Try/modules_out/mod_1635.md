The Ritual Forge is a direct, practical application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, as described by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`)**, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. A ritual's function is to deliberately re-engineer the local terms of this equation to produce a desired outcome.

It does this by:
*   **Maximizing `K_τ`**: Introducing a clear, powerful, and attractive resonant pattern (the ritual's `Ki`) that participants can easily synchronize with, boosting their `Temporal Coherence`.
*   **Modifying `V_Γ`**: Creating a bounded, low-noise environment that reduces the `Temporal Pressure`, lowering the "energy cost" (`V_Γ`) of achieving and maintaining the desired coherent state.

The result is a new path of action, `S_p`, that is so coherent and efficient that participants are drawn into it, leaving their old, less coherent patterns behind. The ritual provides a map and a vehicle for a journey towards higher coherence, making the desired change the path of least resistance.
