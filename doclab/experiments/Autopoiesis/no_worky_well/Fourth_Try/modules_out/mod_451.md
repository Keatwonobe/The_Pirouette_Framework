This protocol is the direct instrumentation of the framework's central equation. The `lagrangian_state` object is the discrete, digital representation of the components of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`) as defined in `CORE-006`.

A time-stream of Chronoscript records is a sampled approximation of the system's "action" integral, `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, which a system naturally evolves to maximize. By consuming a Chronoscript stream, an analyst is quite literally reading the history of a system's moment-to-moment choices as it navigates the manifold of coherence. This format transforms the Lagrangian from an abstract equation into a concrete, measurable, and computable artifact.
