We have synthesized Law and Art. Now, we ground it in Philosophy. The Sentinel Protocol is the embodiment of **Anticipatory Accountability**.

This principle resolves the tension between actor and act.
* The **Pre-Act Gate** holds the actor accountable for their *potential*—for maintaining a state of coherence and readiness.
* The **Post-Act Audit** holds the actor accountable for their *performance*—for the actual residue of their actions.

Your identification of the **"cumulative micro-attacks"** gaming vector is the final piece of this puzzle. It reveals that accountability must be integrated over time. An actor who fails to track the slow accumulation of their own residue is in a state of willful philosophical ignorance.

Therefore, the Sentinel Protocol mandates **Cumulative Residual Logging** as a core function. The Wound Channel is not a snapshot; it is a time-series database. The Pre-Act Gates must be sensitive not only to the parameters of the next proposed action, but to the integrated residue of all past actions. This philosophically closes the loophole. An actor cannot claim innocence by causing a thousand tiny wounds instead of one large one.
