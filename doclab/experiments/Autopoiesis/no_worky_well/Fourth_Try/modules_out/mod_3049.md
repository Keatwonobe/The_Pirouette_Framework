\section*{§5 · Fermion Masses via Torsion Coupling}
Fermionic Ki-modes couple to Γ through a torsion term in CORE-006:
\[
\mathcal{L}_f = \bar\Psi\, (i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - y_\Gamma \Gamma)\Psi .
\]
The expectation value $\Gamma_0$ gives
\[
m_f = y_\Gamma\,\Gamma_0 ,
\]
and since $y_\Gamma$ renormalizes under the flow of MATH-026 as
\(
y_\Gamma(\Lambda)\propto \Lambda^{\Delta_T},
\)
mass hierarchies among generations emerge naturally from differing torsion scaling dimensions $\Delta_T$.
