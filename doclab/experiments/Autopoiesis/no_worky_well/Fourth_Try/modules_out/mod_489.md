The Coherence Auditor is grounded directly in the framework's central equation from `CORE-006`. A system's "health" is its success in following the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, which states that a system will naturally follow a path that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian over time (S_p = ‚à´ ùìõ_p dt).

Every "impact" measured by RPA is a quantifiable, negative perturbation to this integral. The Auditor is, therefore, a tool for empirically discovering what is preventing a system from obeying its own most fundamental drive. It translates a philosophical principle into a diagnostic engine.
