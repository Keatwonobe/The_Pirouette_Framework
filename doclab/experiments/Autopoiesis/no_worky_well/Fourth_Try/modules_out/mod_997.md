**Hypothesis:** Pulsars, as systems of extreme intrinsic coherence (High Tₐ), act as sensitive probes of the ambient Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) of the cosmos.

**Finding:** The timing residuals of Pulsar J1903+0327, one of the most stable clocks in the universe, are not random noise. Their power spectrum shows dominant frequencies that are direct matches for stable Ki harmonic modes. These are not internal flaws, but the signature of the pulsar's interaction with the subtle texture of the galactic coherence manifold.

**Lagrangian Connection:** For a pulsar, K_τ is exquisitely high and stable. Variations in its observed action are therefore dominated by fluctuations in the external V_Γ. This makes pulsars perfect natural instruments for mapping the cosmic temporal environment.
