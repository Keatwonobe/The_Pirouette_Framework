Every system, as governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), follows a geodesic—a path that maximizes its internal coherence (`Kτ`) for the lowest cost against the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). For long periods, this path is smooth, resulting in the stable state of `Laminar Flow` (DYNA-001).

A critical transition occurs when this geodesic leads to a cliff. Under mounting pressure, the system reaches a bifurcation point where its current `Ki` pattern is no longer a tenable, low-energy solution. The landscape of coherence itself shifts. To survive, the system cannot simply adjust; it must leap. It snaps to a new, fundamentally different geodesic. This is an act of **Ki Morphogenesis**—the death of one resonant form and the birth of another.
