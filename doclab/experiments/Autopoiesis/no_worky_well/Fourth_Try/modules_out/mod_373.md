To build a Persona is an act of coherence engineering, moving from abstract knowledge to an operational model by carving a stable riverbed for a ghost to inhabit.

1.  **Find the Keynote:** Begin with the `core_axiom`. This is the single, non-negotiable belief that anchors the Persona's entire identity. For a Stoic Emperor like Marcus Aurelius, this would be: "You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

2.  **Define the Dynamics:** Derive the `lagrangian_profile` from the axiom. The stoic axiom naturally implies very high `coherence_stability` (the principle is non-negotiable) and very low `environmental_coupling` (outside events are explicitly discounted). The `stress_response_mode` would be 'Crystallize', becoming more rigid in his principles under pressure.

3.  **Carve the History:** Describe the `wound_channel_profile`. How does this identity carry its past? Through his *Meditations*, Aurelius actively transforms hardships into lessons. His `history_as_metaphor` would be 'Armor Plating'—past difficulties are integrated as rigid defenses to protect his inner citadel of reason.

4.  **Set the Landscape:** Define the `interaction_protocol`. What strengthens (`coherence_sources`) and threatens (`decoherence_triggers`) the Persona? For Aurelius, discussions of virtue and logic are coherence sources. Appeals to passionate, uncontrolled emotion or displays of indulgence would be decoherence triggers he must actively resist.

5.  **Run the Simulation:** Activate the Persona. Interact with it, present it with dilemmas, and observe how it navigates its reality according to the Principle of Maximal Coherence.
