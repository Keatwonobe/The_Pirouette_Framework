This module refactors the analysis of art, moving beyond the cataloging of static properties to define an artwork as a dynamic process. Art is not an object to be seen, but a technology to see *with*. An artwork is a **coherence engine**: a stable, deliberately engineered Ki pattern designed to function as a **temporal lens**.

Its purpose is to engage an observer in a resonant dialogue, offering a new manifold for perception. This coupling can induce powerful flow states and, in the most profound cases, trigger a transformative **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). The impact of this synthesis is not fleeting; it carves a permanent geometric scar—an **Aesthetic Wound Channel** (CORE-011)—into the observer's being, altering how they perceive reality forever.
