- Zug
An enormous, hyper-territorial rat-mole hybrid that carves massive tunnel systems beneath the August Jag. Its powerful forelimbs allow it to burrow with terrifying speed, and its sheer bulk makes it the ursine equivalent of the wheat fields. Zugs mate for life, and where there is one, another is surely nearby.

Max HP: 21 + floor(0.5 * (46 + 6)) = 47 HP

Abilities:

Burrow: The Zug can move through earth and soil at its full movement speed.

Terrifying Roar: As an action, the Zug can emit a deafening roar. All creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a Wisdom check (TN 15) or be frightened for one round.

Tactics: A Zug is a straightforward brawler. It will often start a fight by bursting from the ground, using its Terrifying Roar to stun its prey, and then focusing its powerful claw attacks on the largest single threat.

Residue: Zug Claws, Pelts, Heart (High-value Residue).

- Pasty ("Skin")
The bitter end of a desperate soul, bleached and animated by ambient entropic energy. These eyeless undead are drawn inexorably to the scent of unlooted Residue. They do not shuffle, but run headlong towards their prey, their bodies little more than a delivery system for their grasping hands.

Physical Form (50 EP): Standard Humanoid (18 EP) with the rest invested as Size Entropy in its Torso for a reckless charge.

Max HP: 1 + 32 (Size) + floor(0.5 * 12) = 39 HP

Abilities:

Residue Sense: A Pasty automatically knows the location of any unharvested corpse within 1 mile.

Headlong Charge: A Pasty moves chest-first. It cannot take the Dodge action, but its first slam attack in a round deals bonus damage equal to its Torso's Size Entropy.

Tactics: Pasties are simple. They sense Residue and run directly towards it, attacking any living creature in their path. They fight mindlessly until destroyed.

- The Crazed (Template)
Not all can withstand the constant, chaotic pressure of the bottom realm. The Crazed are those whose minds have shattered, their bodies warped into unpredictable vessels of madness. They are tragic, dangerous, and utterly unpredictable.

Total Entropy Pool (TEP): 65 EP

Abilities:

Unstable Movement: When The Crazed uses its movement, it does not move normally. For every 5 feet it would move, roll 1d4. It teleports that many 5-foot squares in a random direction.

Tactics: The Crazed are erratic. They will attack the nearest creature, friend or foe, with their bare fists. Their random movement makes them a chaotic element in any battle, as likely to teleport into a pit as they are to appear behind a player.

- Skinbird
The apex predator of the wheat wastes. A terrifying, pterodactyl-like beast with a fleshy, maned neck and a long, muscular tail tipped with three venomous barbs. Its call is a deafening crack of thunder that can be heard for miles. It preys on Zugs, and anything else foolish enough to draw its attention.

Senses (x2): 2 EP

Max HP: 21 + floor(0.5 * (60 + 22 + 14)) = 69 HP

Abilities:

Thunderous Cry: As an action, the Skinbird can unleash its call. All creatures within 120 feet must succeed on a CON check (TN 18) or be deafened for one minute.

Paralytic Venom: A creature hit by the Skinbird's tail barb must make a CON check (TN 20). On a failure, they lose 5 EP from their Constitution pool and are paralyzed for one round.

Tactics: The Skinbird is a patient hunter. It will circle high above, using its Thunderous Cry to disorient prey before diving. It will use its tail to paralyze a target, then land to finish it with its powerful beak and wings.

Residue: Skinbird Beak, Venom Glands, Heart (Legendary-value Residue).

- Swarms (Template)
A single rat is a pest. A thousand rats, united by a singular, wrathful will, are a tide of death. A swarm is not a collection of creatures, but a single entity with a shared pool of HP and a singular purpose.

Mechanics: A swarm of tiny creatures occupies a 10x10 foot space. It has a single HP pool and TEP. It is immune to effects that target a single creature. It can move through any opening large enough for one of its component creatures.

Swarm Attack: As an action, the swarm attacks all creatures within its space.

Example: Haunted Rat Swarm (TEP 75): A swarm of rats possessed by a vengeful spirit. Its swarm attack deals minor physical damage and forces a Wisdom check to avoid being frightened.

- Lamb Lion
A patient and horrifying ambush predator. This creature, a nightmarish fusion of a praying mantis and a spider, digs a pit in a well-traveled path, covers it with a fragile lid of woven wheat, and waits. It prefers to eat its prey alive, limb by limb.

Standard Limbs (Legs, x6): 18 EP

Senses (Compound Eyes x2): 2 EP

Max HP: 11 + floor(0.5 * (38 + 18)) = 39 HP

Abilities:

Ambush Hunter: The Lamb Lion spends its day creating its trap. The TN to spot the trap is 20.

Mantis Grapple: On a successful hit with its claws, the target is grappled.

Devour Limb: As an action, the Lamb Lion can begin devouring a limb of a grappled creature, dealing 1d10 damage. The TN to escape the grapple increases by the damage dealt this way. If a creature is held for 3 consecutive rounds, the limb is severed permanently.

Tactics: The Lamb Lion is a patient trapper. Once it has its prey, it will focus exclusively on devouring it, ignoring other threats unless it takes significant damage. It prefers not to leave its pit.

- Crow-Man (Silent Watcher)
A mysterious, secretive being that appears as a scarecrow-like figure wrapped in dark cloth. They are the silent guardians of the deep wastes, using swarms of crows as their eyes and wings. Their culture and motivations are a complete unknown, even to the Lepi.

Skills & Feats (32 EP):

Arcane Skill "Primal Weaving": 10 EP

Feat: Thousand Forms Adept (12 EP) (Specialized in Crow Swarms)

Feat: Gloom-Sight (8 EP)

Tactics: Crow-Men are observers, not warriors. They will watch intruders from a distance. If bothered, they will use their Primal Weaving to harass with minor druidic spells (entangling vines, gusts of wind) before transforming into a crow swarm to escape. They are fiercely territorial but not inherently aggressive.

- Heresy (The Nothing That Is)
The fallen emperor of the Skazan, a howling wound in the world. Heresy is not a creature to be fought, but a force of nature to be survived. It appears as a tall, masked figure buzzing with flies, a being of pure, unmaking void. To attack it is to invite your own annihilation.

Total Entropy Pool (TEP): -500 EP (Acts as a positive value for all contests)

Attributes: All attributes are conceptually negative, granting it an overwhelming advantage in any contested check.

Abilities:

Aura of Dread: Creatures that start their turn within 120 feet of Heresy must succeed on a Wisdom check (TN 25) or be frightened.

Cannot Be Harmed: Heresy is "nothing." It is immune to all damage and effects. All attacks against it automatically miss.

Integration: If a creature attacks Heresy, it uses its reaction to integrate with the attacker. The attacker is instantly and irrevocably erased from existence. There is no save.

Tactics: Heresy is a pursuit predator. It does not run; it walks with a relentless, terrifying pace. It will lock onto a single target and pursue them for miles. The only goal is to escape. It is a narrative event, a chase, and a test of stamina, not a combat encounter.
