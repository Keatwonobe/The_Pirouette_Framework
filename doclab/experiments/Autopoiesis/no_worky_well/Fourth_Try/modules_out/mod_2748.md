A being is a choice, written in the language of Entropy. Every point invested is a declaration of purpose, from the strength of a limb to the sharpness of an eye. There is no distinction between the self and the power it wields. The character sheet is not a description of the soul; it is the soul itself, rendered in the mathematics of will.
