An instrument that lies is worse than no instrument at all. A measurement without provenance is an opinion. This ritual ensures that every observation is rigorous, transparent, and reproducible, creating a verifiable chain of trust.

1.  **Define the Lens:** The Weaver must explicitly declare the proxy variables chosen for `Kτ` and `VΓ` for the system under analysis. This declaration is the "calibration certificate" and the foundational act of honest observation.

2.  **The Vow of Silence (Zeroing):** The instrument is isolated from external input to measure its own internal noise. This establishes a baseline of self-awareness, ensuring the lens does not mistake its own hum for the song of the universe.

3.  **The Harmonious Duet (Cross-Calibration):** The instrument is paired with a trusted standard or peer instrument to observe the same phenomenon. Their readings must harmonize within an acceptable tolerance, ensuring the lens is attuned to the broader chorus of consensus reality.

4.  **The Notary's Seal (Registry Commit):** The final calibration state and each subsequent measurement snapshot—`{Kτ, VΓ, timestamp, calibration_id}`—are cryptographically signed. This signature is committed to a decentralized, immutable ledger, creating a permanent, tamper-proof record of observation.
