summary: Provides the primary diagnostic protocol for systemic analysis. This module
  reframes signal extraction as a two-stage process for calculating a system's Coherence-Pressure
  Balance (CPB), a direct, practical application of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The
  Sieve allows a Weaver to measure the health, efficiency, and vitality of any system
  from its data.
