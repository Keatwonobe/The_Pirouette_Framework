Where the Conceptual Lens is an act of translation, the Resonance Lens is an act of instrumentation. It is a formal, computational protocol for taking any high-dimensional, complex data stream and isolating the "song" of a system's coherence from the "noise" of its environment.

The protocol transforms the Pirouette Lagrangian from a declarative law into a predictive, analytical engine.

1.  **Ingest & Characterize Γ (Measure the Storm):** The raw data stream is ingested. Its complexity, volatility, and dissonance are analyzed to produce a quantitative measure of the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).

2.  **Hypothesize Ki (Select an Archetype):** From the Ki Archetype Library (§6), the Weaver selects a candidate resonance pattern—a hypothesis about the *kind* of song the system might be singing to survive this particular storm.

3.  **Project & Minimize Action (Tune the Instrument):** A Projection Operator (a computational algorithm) attempts to fit the noisy data to the chosen archetype. Its sole function is to find the parameters that **maximize the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**, computationally searching for the system's geodesic of maximal coherence.

4.  **Measure Coherence (Find the Note):** The success of the projection is measured by the resulting Temporal Coherence (T_a) of the solution. The archetype that produces the highest and most stable T_a is confirmed as the system's Ki pattern.
