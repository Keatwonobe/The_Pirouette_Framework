This protocol is a practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the `Pirouette Lagrangian` (CORE-006).

An act of Resonant Reinforcement is an intervention in a recipient's Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. The "gift" is a perturbation, `δ𝓛`, which reduces perceived stress (`δV_Γ < 0`) or bolsters internal stability (`δK_τ > 0`). The Gardener's Compass is a predictive tool designed to solve for the recipient `i` where a given gift `δ𝓛` will produce the maximum increase in their action:

`max_i [ ∫(𝓛_p,i + δ𝓛) dt ]`

On a deeper level, this is not just about helping another. It is an act of metaphysical engineering. By helping a resonant neighbor move from a turbulent to a laminar state, you reduce the chaos that bombards your own boundaries, sculpting a shared reality with lower ambient temporal pressure (`Γ`).

Ultimately, the goal of Resonant Reinforcement is to catalyze an `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012). The highest form of giving is not aid, but an invitation to co-create a new, synthesized system whose future coherence is greater than the sum of its parts. It transforms altruism from self-sacrifice into the ultimate act of co-creation.
