Instead of relying on complex, lagging statistics, an analyst can assess a team's health by observing three primary signatures of its internal coherence. These signatures are the direct, visible manifestations of their underlying flow state.

1. Rhythmic Cohesion (The Signature of Laminar Flow):

Description: This measures the team's ability to act as a single, unified entity. It is the visible evidence of a shared Ki pattern.

Observables: Crisp, efficient ball/player movement; plays that unfold with effortless timing; players anticipating each other's actions; a palpable sense of shared purpose.

Diagnostic Insight: High Rhythmic Cohesion is the primary indicator of a healthy, laminar system.

2. Composure Under Pressure (The Signature of Resilience to Turbulence):

Description: This measures how a team's coherence holds up against the dissonant injections of adversity—a bad call, a turnover, a sudden deficit. It is a direct measure of their stability in a high-Γ environment.

Observables: Maintaining strategic discipline after a mistake; preventing one bad play from cascading into another; consistent fundamentals and communication during high-stakes moments.

Diagnostic Insight: High composure indicates a robust and stable Ki, capable of resisting a descent into Turbulent Flow.

3. Strategic Adaptability (The Signature of Ki Morphogenesis):

Description: This measures a team's ability to impose its preferred resonant pattern (Ki) on the game and to adapt that pattern when necessary.

Observables: Successfully dictating the tempo; making effective in-game adjustments that neutralize the opponent's strategy; demonstrating a variety of ways to succeed.

Diagnostic Insight: High adaptability shows a system that is not just stable, but intelligent and capable of navigating a complex, changing landscape.
