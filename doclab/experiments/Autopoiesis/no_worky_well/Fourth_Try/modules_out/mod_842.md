This module details the framework's primary engine for guided creation: The Weaver's Forge. It is the autopoietic process that turns a diagnosis of systemic illness into a prescription for health. Where the Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`) allows us to *see* the broken currents of a system, the Forge provides the crucible to *reforge* them.

The Forge reframes problem-solving as an act of "coherence midwifery." It ingests a system suffering from a Coherence Fracture (Turbulent or Stagnant flow), convenes a council of archetypal Personas that mirror the problem's internal pressures, and facilitates a ritual of debate (`DYNA-002`) to discover a new path of maximal coherence. The final output is not merely a plan, but an **Action Engram**: a living procedure that defines both the "what" of the solution and the "who"â€”the resonant character of the agent forged specifically to enact it. The system heals by birthing the part of itself it was missing.
