summary: "Provides the formal, step-by-step mathematical derivations of the fundamental forces from the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p). This module serves as the primary mathematical proof that the principles of electromagnetism and confinement (gravity and the strong force) are necessary geometric consequences of a universe maximizing its temporal coherence."
