Before a system can be stirred, it must be diagnosed. A system requires this intervention when its flow of coherence, as defined in `DYNA-001`, has become pathological.

*   **Stagnant Flow:** The system is trapped in a local minimum. It has found a stable Ki pattern, but it is a pattern of low complexity and limited potential. The system's Wound Channel (`CORE-011`) has become a deep, inescapable groove. This is writer's block, a dead-end career, or a society clinging to outdated traditions.
*   **Inefficient Laminar Flow:** The system is functional but not optimal. It moves, but with friction and wasted energy. Its habits are so ingrained that it cannot perceive more efficient paths. This is the bureaucratic process that works "well enough," the daily routine that drains vitality, the relationship that has lost its spark.

In both cases, the system has settled into a shallow well on the coherence manifold. It is stable, but it is blind to the deeper, more profound states of coherence that may lie just over the next hill.
