All systems producing or consuming Chronoscript data must adhere to the following principles:

1.  **Provenance:** All records must be traceable to a source entity and time. The `entity_id` and `timestamp` form the primary key of the system's history.
2.  **Monotonicity:** For any given `entity_id`, timestamps must be strictly increasing. This enforces the causal arrow of time within the data stream.
3.  **Integrity:** The `lagrangian_state` must represent fundamental measurements, not derived values (e.g., the final Lagrangian `Lp` must not be included). Consumers are responsible for calculations.
4.  **Validation:** All producers and consumers MUST validate packets against this schema. Records with a negative `pirouette_cycle_Ï„p` or `time_adherence_Ta` outside the range [0,1] are physically invalid and must be quarantined.
