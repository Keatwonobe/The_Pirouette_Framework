summary: Provides a universal protocol for quantifying a system's Temporal Coherence
  (formerly Time-Adherence, Ta). It redefines this concept not as a fundamental parameter,
  but as a diagnostic for the stability and purity of a system's resonant Ki pattern,
  providing a critical, measurable input for the Pirouette Lagrangian.
