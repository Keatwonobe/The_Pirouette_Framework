The universe builds its most enduring structures not from tranquility, but from perfectly contained turbulence. The legacy framework's insight was potent: that stable structures emerge from localized zones of temporal disruption, or 'eddies'. This module refactors that insight into a rigorous, time-first geometric framework.

A **Coherence Vortex** is not a failure of time, but a specific topological feature of the coherence manifold derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian. It is a stable region of high rotational shear, or *torsion*, where the path of maximal coherence ceases to be a straight line and curls back upon itself. Confinement is revealed not as a force, but as a geometryâ€”an elegant prison whose walls are built from the prisoner's own relentless drive to exist. This module provides the analytical tools to map these vortices, revealing them as the fundamental mechanism for all stable, bound states.
