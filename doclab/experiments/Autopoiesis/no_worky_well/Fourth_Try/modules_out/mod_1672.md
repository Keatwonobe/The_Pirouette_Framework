This instrument is a direct and practical application of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. The Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, is not just a theoretical construct; it is the engine of this diagnostic tool.

The **Geodesic Blueprint** is the path through spacetime that maximizes the action of the system's Lagrangian. It is the embodiment of the `Principle of Maximal Coherence`.

The **Coherence Audit Map** is a visualization of the system's failure to adhere to this principle. A point of high dissonance (`Δ𝓛`) is a location in spacetime where the system's actual state is radically suboptimal. By analyzing the components of `Δ𝓛`, a Weaver can determine *why* the system is deviating:
*   Is it suffering from internal dissonance (a drop in **Temporal Coherence, Kτ**)?
*   Is it buckling under external stress it cannot adapt to (an unmanaged spike in **Temporal Pressure, V_Γ**)?

The Auditor measures not just error, but the *metabolic cost* of that error, turning abstract mathematics into a tangible diagnostic tool.
