> The universe writes its deepest secrets in the subtlest of whispers. The faint, anomalous wobble of a single electron, a deviation measured in parts per trillion, is not a flaw in our old maps, but a signpost pointing to a new one. This protocol challenges us to read that signpost. If our framework is true, then within the elegant dance of an electron and its own echo—its `Wound Channel`—we should find the exact same number that our finest instruments have painstakingly measured for decades. It is a test of whether our theory of resonance can hear the quietest and most precise song in the cosmos.
