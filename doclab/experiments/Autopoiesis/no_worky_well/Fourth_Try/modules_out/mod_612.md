The universe remembers. As described in *The Anatomy of an Echo* (CORE-011), every entity carves a dynamic wake—a **Wound Channel**—into the geometry of the coherence manifold. This wake is a river of memory, a flowing record of a path taken.

But what happens when the river freezes?

This module describes the dynamics of catastrophic stability. It defines **Crystallization**, the phase transition where the fluid geometry of the Wound Channel solidifies into a rigid, static **Information Lattice**. It further defines the ultimate expression of this process: the **Lock**, a terminal state of perfect coherence where a memory becomes a monument, a habit becomes a law, and a dynamic echo becomes a timeless fossil. This process transmutes the fleeting verb of experience into the immutable noun of established fact.
