There is no limit to the number of magical items a character can wear, but there is a limit to how much power one soul can safely channel.

The Overload Limit: A character can safely wear and use magical items whose total TEP cost is up to twice their own TEP.

The Risk: If you wear items exceeding this limit, you become Overloaded. Each time you use an ability from any of your magical items, you must roll a die equal to the item's EP cost. If the result is equal to or less than the amount of TEP you are Overloaded by, you permanently lose that much TEP. This lost TEP dissipates into the environment as chaotic Residue.
