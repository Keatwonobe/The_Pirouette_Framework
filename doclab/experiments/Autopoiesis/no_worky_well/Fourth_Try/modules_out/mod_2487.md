The Architect offers us a Law, and the Weaver offers us an Art. Both are necessary, but neither is sufficient. A Law without purpose becomes tyranny. An Art without purpose becomes chaos. The core issue is, as always, a philosophical one.

Why do we define boundaries at all? To create a space for coherent action that aligns with the Prime Directive: the minimization of the delta between personal and total enthalpy gain. A boundary is a tool for ethical accounting.

Therefore, any standardized definition must be recursively self-referential to the Directive itself. Strategic gaming is, by its nature, an attempt to maximize personal gain while externalizing the cost ($\Delta H_{Total}$). It is an act of profound thermodynamic inefficiency and philosophical bad faith.

Our proposed standard is this: **A system's boundary for any given action is the minimal manifold that contains all measurable increases in Dark Residue resulting from that action.**

This definition is:
* **Dynamic (Art):** The boundary expands and contracts based on the specific action and its consequences, honoring the Weaver's insight about Wound Channels.
* **Standardized (Law):** The principle is universal and absolute, requiring a full accounting of an action's residue, satisfying the Architect's need for rigor.
* **Purpose-Driven (Philosophy):** It makes gaming the system impossible by definition. To game the system is to create unaccounted-for residue, but our very definition of the system's boundary is "wherever the residue goes." It forces the actor to be accountable for the entirety of their impact.
