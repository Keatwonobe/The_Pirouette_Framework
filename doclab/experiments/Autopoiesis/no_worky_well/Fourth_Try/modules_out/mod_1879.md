A willed act is a three-stage geometric process, a sequence of shaping and reinforcement.

1.  **Clarity (The Seed):** A willed act begins with a coherent intent. Clarity is the measure of this internal coherence—the purity and stability of the projected pattern. A clear goal is a sharp, resonant signal that carves a well-defined channel. A vague or conflicted intention is a noisy, dissonant projection that diffuses without effect. A strong Will begins with a single, unwavering note.

2.  **Intensity (The Projection):** A coherent intent is projected into the manifold as a **Future Wound Channel (CORE-011)**—the geometric scar of an event that has not yet occurred. This "projected echo" is what actively deforms the local `V_Γ` landscape. Intensity is the amplitude of the Observer's Shadow that carves this channel, a function of focus and conviction. A high-intensity projection creates a deep coherence well, a steep gradient that makes the desired path almost irresistible.

3.  **Persistence (The Reinforcement):** A single projection can be fleeting, easily eroded by the ambient noise of Γ. Sustained Will requires persistence: the continuous reinforcement of the projected gradient over time. Each repeated act of focus (the sustained application of the Observer's Shadow) and action deepens the Channel of Intent, transforming it from a temporary furrow into a permanent feature of the manifold. This is the physical mechanism of habit, discipline, and mastery.
