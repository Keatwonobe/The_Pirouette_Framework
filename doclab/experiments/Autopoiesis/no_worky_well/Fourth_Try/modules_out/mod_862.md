What guides this engine? The old Metabolic Efficiency Index (MEI) is replaced by a single, elegant law: **The Principle of Maximal Coherence**, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

`𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

The Autopoietic Engine is a physical system obeying the principle of least action. At every moment, it dynamically adjusts its state (its Ki) to find the path that maximizes the action of its Lagrangian.

**S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt = ∫ (K_τ - V_Γ) dt**

A "healthy" cycle is one that finds a new state which increases its internal Temporal Coherence (K_τ) while minimizing the "cost" of resisting external Temporal Pressure (V_Γ). "Growth," "learning," and "evolution" are the tangible results of a system becoming progressively better at maximizing this integral.
