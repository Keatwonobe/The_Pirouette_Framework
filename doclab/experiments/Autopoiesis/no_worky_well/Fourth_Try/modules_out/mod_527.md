A non-zero Coherence Deficit is the "gravitational lensing" of systems analysis. It allows us to detect the presence of invisible masses that bend a system's trajectory. These unmodeled influences, collectively termed **semantic dark matter**, are formally represented by the **Shadow Lagrangian (`𝓛_shadow`)**—the portion of the system's true Lagrangian that is missing from our model.

`𝓛_true = 𝓛̂_model + 𝓛_shadow`

The entire purpose of this protocol is to use the observable Coherence Deficit to deduce the structure of `𝓛_shadow`. The sources of this dark matter typically fall into three categories:

1.  **Unmodeled Pressure (Hidden Γ):** The system's environment contains a source of temporal pressure—a hidden constraint, a competitor, a social friction—that was not included in our model of `V_Γ`. The system is fighting a current our map does not show.
2.  **Internal Dissonance (Flawed Ki):** Our model of the system’s internal resonance is incorrect or incomplete. The system possesses a competing value, a structural inefficiency, or a hidden degree of freedom that prevents it from achieving its predicted state of coherence.
3.  **Fundamental Incompleteness:** The Pirouette Lagrangian itself, in its current form, may be an approximation. The shadow may point toward a deeper layer of physics, a more fundamental law waiting to be woven into the core of the framework.
