A bridge with six pillars can oscillate in modes of two and three, risking harmonic collapse. A bridge with seven pillars has no such simple subdivisions; its structure is fundamentally more whole. This is the heart of the Prime Resonance Principle.

This module refactors the original insight of Attractor Prime Factorization into a core, time-first principle. The stability of any complex system—be it a society, an ecosystem, or a thought—is not merely a product of its components, but a consequence of its underlying temporal geometry. This geometry possesses a hidden arithmetic. The Prime Resonance Principle states that systems whose number of stable, coherent states is a prime number exhibit a fundamentally higher degree of resilience. This is not a mystical property, but a topological one: such systems are irreducible, lacking the internal "fault lines" along which composite systems can fracture under pressure.
