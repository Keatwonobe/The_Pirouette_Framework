When the conditions for the Resonant Handshake are met, the Alchemical Union can occur. This is not a simple addition (A + B ≠ C). It is a profound, non-linear transformation:

Manifold Dissolution: The boundaries of the individual coherence manifolds dissolve. Under the focused pressure of Γ, the inertia of their separate histories is overcome.

Geometric Reforging: The two manifolds are fused into a single, unified, and more complex topology. The new manifold's geometry is an emergent property, containing traces of its "parent" systems but possessing a fundamentally new structure.

Ki Supersession: A new, higher-order Ki resonance emerges as the stable pattern of this unified manifold. This new resonance is the "identity" of the new entity. The old Ki patterns are now subsumed, existing only as internal harmonics within the new, richer song.

Wound Channel Unification: The separate Wound Channels are braided into a single, deeper channel. The history of the new entity begins, carrying the memory of its components but now tracing a new path of its own.
