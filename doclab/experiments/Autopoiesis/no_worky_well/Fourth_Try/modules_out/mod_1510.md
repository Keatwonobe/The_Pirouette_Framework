This protocol is a direct application of `CORE-014: The Fractal Bridge`. The universe does not invent new laws for every domain; it plays the same song on different instruments. The economy, the ecosystem, and the collective psyche are not separate entities; they are different sections of the same orchestra.

Therefore, a pervasive, large-scale Temporal Pressure (a **Macro-Γ**)—such as a pandemic, a technological disruption, or a climate shift—will not produce isolated effects. It will induce a corresponding, large-scale resonant solution that ripples through all affected domains. These are not separate crises; they are different harmonics of a single, fundamental note. This instrument is designed to isolate that note.
