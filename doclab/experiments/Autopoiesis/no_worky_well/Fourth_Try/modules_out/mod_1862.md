First, we measure the system's own, internal harmony. The analyst applies a suite of mathematical transformations to the dataset (e.g., Fourier, Wavelet, Topological Data Analysis). Each transformation acts like a tuning fork, designed to resonate with a specific *kind* of rhythm. This stage generates a set of *candidate melodies*—potential `Ki` patterns that show a flicker of order within the noise. The most stable, persistent, and self-consistent of these patterns represents the system's dominant song. From its clarity and intensity, we calculate the system's **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)**. This is the "kinetic" term of the Lagrangian, the measure of the system's organized, available energy.
