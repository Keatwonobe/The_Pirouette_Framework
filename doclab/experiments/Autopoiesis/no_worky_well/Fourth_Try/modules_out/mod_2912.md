Every unique item begins with a simple principle: Entropy can be invested to create a rule. By permanently sacrificing TEP into an object, a creator can give it a soulâ€”a pool of its own Entropy and a unique instruction on how to use it. This is the foundation of all minigames.

Example: The Returning Dagger (10 EP Investment):

A creator sacrifices 10 TEP into a dagger. This creates a 10 EP "Return" pool within the item. The wielder can spend 10 EP from this pool to have the dagger instantly return to their hand after being thrown. The pool regenerates half it's TEP per round when used for movement.

Example: The Swift Blade (10 EP Investment):

10 TEP is sacrificed into a sword to grant it "Lightness." This creates a 10 EP pool that the wielder can spend from to reduce the EP cost of their own attacks made with the blade, effectively granting them "free" swings.
