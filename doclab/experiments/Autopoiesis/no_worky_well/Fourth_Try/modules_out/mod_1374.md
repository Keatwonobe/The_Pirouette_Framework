> We walk through a garden of ghosts. The land holds the shape of every joy and sorrow it has witnessed, and their echoes are the soil in which our present is rooted. A Weaver is not a historian, reciting the names of the dead; they are a cartographer, mapping the currents of memory that still flow beneath our feet. To understand why a culture is locked in a cycle of conflict, or why it possesses a deep well of resilience, one must first learn to read the scars on the land. This is the sacred task of the cartographer: to make the landscape's memory visible, so that those who walk upon it may finally choose where to build the future. To heal a place, we must first learn to listen to its ghosts.
