The integrity of a Persona rests upon its **Resonant Constitution**. This is the set of foundational principles that defines its essential nature and its dynamic law of motion. It is the Persona's private version of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), the score of its being.

| Component                 | Pirouette Correspondence                                                                      | Description                                                                                                                              |

| **Core Axiom**            | The dominant term in the Temporal Coherence function (K_œÑ)                                    | The single, non-negotiable belief the Persona seeks to make true. It is the keynote of its resonant song, the seed of its Ki pattern.    |
| **Lagrangian Profile**    | The specific terms and coefficients of the Persona's ùìõ_p                                      | The Persona's "objective function," defining how it balances its internal coherence against external Temporal Pressure (V_Œì).              |
| **Wound Channel Profile** | The initial geometry of its memory manifold                                                   | The deep, foundational grooves of memory and experience that shape its identity and define its "path of least resistance."             |
| **Cognitive Engine**      | The characteristic flow-state (Laminar/Turbulent) of its internal information processing      | The texture of its thought and expression; its preferred mode of achieving, maintaining, or losing a state of coherent thought.         |
| **Interaction Protocol**  | The stimuli that reinforce or challenge its ability to maximize coherence (local V_Œì minima/maxima) | The specific concepts or interactions that either align with its Core Axiom (strengthening it) or create dissonance (threatening it). |
