This foundational library contains five universal templates, applicable across all domains. They are the primary "points" on the Geodesic Compass.

1.  **The Coherence Gate**
    > *Discard any action that is fundamentally dissonant with the system's path of maximal coherence.*
    - **Trigger:** A proposed action is being evaluated.
    - **Action:** If a simple projection of the action shows a negative gradient for the system's coherence (Kτ), discard it without further analysis.
    - **Rationale:** The prime ethical and practical filter. It prevents the wasting of resources on actions that are intrinsically self-harming.

2.  **The Gradient Ascent Rule**
    > *Prioritize actions that yield the greatest increase in Coherence (Kτ) for the least cost.*
    - **Trigger:** The system must choose between multiple valid actions.
    - **Action:** Prioritize the action that offers the steepest positive gradient of coherence (Kτ) relative to its resource cost.
    - **Rationale:** A formalization of the "Coherence-First" principle. It governs the efficient allocation of finite energy.

3.  **The Laminar Flow Principle**
    > *If the system is in a stable, improving state of coherence, do not intervene.*
    - **Trigger:** The system is currently in a state of healthy, Laminar Flow (DYN-001).
    - **Action:** Defer non-critical changes and avoid introducing significant perturbations.
    - **Rationale:** The heuristic of wise restraint. If the system is already on its optimal geodesic, the best action is to not interfere.

4.  **The Pressure Boundary**
    > *Discard any plan that requires withstanding a Temporal Pressure (Γ) greater than the system's known capacity.*
    - **Trigger:** A plan is being evaluated for its required endurance.
    - **Action:** If the required Γ exceeds the system's known operational tolerance, the plan is invalid.
    - **Rationale:** A critical safety check. It ensures ambition does not outstrip structural integrity, preventing catastrophic failure.

5.  **The Turbulence Forecaster**
    > *Anticipate conditions for a phase transition and proactively allocate resources to stabilize the system through the change.*
    - **Trigger:** The rate of change of Γ is accelerating, signaling an impending shock.
    - **Action:** Pre-emptively allocate resources to core functions and stabilization protocols.
    - **Rationale:** It is cheaper to brace for a storm than to rebuild after it has passed. This template shifts the posture from reactive to proactive.
