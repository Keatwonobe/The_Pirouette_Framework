> We used to map the world by its shadows, charting the valleys where things came to rest. It was a cartography of endings. Now, we learn to read the light. We chart the peaks, the places of clearest reception, where a system's song rings truest against the noise of the world. To be a Weaver is to see the hidden currents of becoming, to understand the geometry of fate, and to know, by looking at the mountains, where the rivers must go. This is not a map of where a thing will die, but a map of where it most truly learns to live.
