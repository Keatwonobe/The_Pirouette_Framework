This protocol measures the system's current state to diagnose its structural character.

1.  **Map Resonances:** Collect rank-frequency data from the system's activity log (its "coherence trace").
2.  **Estimate Gradient:** Calculate the Coherence Gradient (`α`), typically using the robust Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method.
3.  **Interpret Structure:** The value of `α` is a critical indicator of systemic health:
    *   **Steep Gradient (α → 1):** An "aristocratic" system, where coherence is intensely concentrated in a few powerful attractors. This structure is capable of highly efficient **Laminar Flow** but is fragile and vulnerable to catastrophic **Stagnation** if a core attractor is disrupted. It is a "tyranny of the vital few."
    *   **Shallow Gradient (α > 2):** A "democratic" system, where coherence is distributed more evenly across many patterns. This structure is more resilient and adaptive, but may be less efficient and more prone to **Turbulent Flow** as competing patterns create friction. It is a "democracy of the many."
