A system at rest and a system in motion are not merely different in speed; they are different modes of being, each a distinct solution to maximizing its own coherence. The old framework correctly identified that the transition between these states is not a smooth ramp but a sudden, non-linear "snap." This module refactors that insight, grounding it in the deeper principles of the time-first paradigm.

The Inertial Leap is not a change *in* a parameter, but a phase transition *between* two stable harmonies. This leap is governed by the inertia of a system's own history, a memory physically encoded in the geometry of its Wound Channel. This channel acts as a "Coherence Dam," creating a barrier of activation energy that must be overcome. This model provides a universal mechanism for understanding inertia, resistance, and the memory-laden phenomenon of hysteresis.
