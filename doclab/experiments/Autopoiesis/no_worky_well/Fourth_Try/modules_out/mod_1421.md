With this lens, we can trace flow disruptions to their root pathology:

1.  **Map the Currents:** Identify the critical flows of coherence (e.g., project data, strategic intent, citations, attention).
2.  **Diagnose the Flow:** Observe whether the currents are Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant.
3.  **Identify the Pathology:**
    *   **Coherence Fever (Turbulent):** An online community devolves into chaos due to the injection of targeted misinformation. A person is wracked with anxiety from consuming a constant stream of contradictory news.
    *   **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnant):** A team is paralyzed because critical information is siloed. A researcher cannot solve a problem because they are unaware of a tool from another field.
    *   **Coherence Erosion (Decay):** A craft or skill is lost because its Wound Channel is not reinforced through practice. A corporate culture's core values fade as institutional memory is lost.
