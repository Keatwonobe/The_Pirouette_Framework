A system in a state of healthy, laminar flow is like a river moving through a well-defined valley. Its path is predictable, its energy conserved. But what happens when that river reaches a continental divide—a moment where the landscape offers not one, but multiple paths to the sea?

The old framework termed this a 'Fork'. We reframe it as a **Watershed Event**: a critical, creative, and often chaotic juncture where a system’s single, coherent path fractures into two or more distinct futures. This is not a failure, but a fundamental dynamic of evolution. It is a **coherence crisis** where a system’s resonant pattern (Ki) can no longer be sustained, forcing it to resolve its instability by becoming something new. It is the point where a single reality branches into a plurality of possibilities.
