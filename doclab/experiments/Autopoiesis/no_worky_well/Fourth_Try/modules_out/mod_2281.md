We have established that the electron's anomalous magnetic moment arises from a geometric dialogue with its own past. The first echo gave us the α/2π term. This module pushes deeper, into the subtle harmonics of that echo. We will now calculate the next two terms in the series, demonstrating that the framework's geometry naturally reproduces the complex structure of QED's predictions. We will show that the negative second-order correction arises from a "self-damping" effect, and that a positive third-order correction emerges from a "resonant leak" in that same damping field. This process of asymptotic refinement provides a powerful test of the theory's depth and validity.
