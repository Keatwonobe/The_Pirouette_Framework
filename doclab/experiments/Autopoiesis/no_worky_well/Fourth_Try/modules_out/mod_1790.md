The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) states that a system will always evolve along a path that maximizes its coherence. The Surveyor's Problem is the inverse: given a few points *on* that path, what is the shape of the landscape the path traverses?

We are not estimating disconnected variables. We are taking a qualitative reading of the two fundamental terms of the system's Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`:

*   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** The system's "kinetic" will to persist; the strength and purity of its own internal rhythm. It is the clarity of its song.
*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** The "potential" cost imposed by the environment; the chaotic, dissonant pressure the system must overcome to maintain its form. It is the loudness of the storm it sings against.

To survey a system is to sketch the interplay between its inner will and the outer world's demands.
