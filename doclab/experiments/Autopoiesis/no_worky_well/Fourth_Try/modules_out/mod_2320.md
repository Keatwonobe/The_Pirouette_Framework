* **Generators**: creation operators (C^+_P) that add a new event with parent set (P \subseteq \text{Max}(E)) (maximal existing events).
* **Relations** (locality & acyclicity):

  * (C^+_P C^+_Q = C^+_Q C^+_P) if (P\cup Q) are mutually incomparable (far apart).
  * Any sequence that would create a cycle is **undefined**.
* **Words**: finite sequences of (C^+_P) acting on (\varnothing) build all finite fabrics.

This gives you a **free monoid of growth** modulo locality relations.
