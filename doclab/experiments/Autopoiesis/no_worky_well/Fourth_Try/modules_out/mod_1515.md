The final output is the **Coherence Tapestry**: a multi-layered, time-series visualization that transforms a static measure into a dynamic narrative of systemic influence. It reveals:
-   **Periods of High Resonance:** Time windows where the domains moved in lockstep, indicating a powerful, unifying influence.
-   **Phase Leads and Lags:** Which domain acts as the "pacemaker," its rhythm shifting just before the others follow, revealing the direction of causality.
-   **Resonance Breaks:** Moments where a thread "snaps" out of the shared pattern, signaling a decoupling, an external shock, or an act of systemic resistance.
