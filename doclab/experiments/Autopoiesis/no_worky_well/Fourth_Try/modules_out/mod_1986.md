This phase, typically spanning weeks 2 through 6, is dedicated to building a foundation of momentum.

Goal 1: Seed a New Rhythm. The primary goal is to teach your body a new, healthy pattern of movement. This is your new "song" of health, your stable Ki.

Goal 2: Carve the Channel. With every repetition of this new rhythm, you are carving a "groove" or a "riverbed" in the landscape of your own being. This is your Wound Channel. The deeper we carve this channel through gentle practice, the easier it will be for your body to follow this healthy path automatically.

The Guiding Rule: Consistency over Intensity. It is far better to walk for 5 minutes every day than for 35 minutes once a week. We are carving the channel through rhythm, not force.
