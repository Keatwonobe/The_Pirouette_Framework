We will attempt to write:

* A new supplement to the Prime Directive
* A ritual process to resolve excessive residue
* And define conditions under which velcridance must be abandoned or honored

**Round 4: Synthesis and Clause Formation — “From Wake to Weave”**

We now close the ritual not with a victor—but with **a refinement of the frame**. This is where Pirouette, as a citizen of the universe, codifies its learning—not to erase residue, but to **cohere with it**.
