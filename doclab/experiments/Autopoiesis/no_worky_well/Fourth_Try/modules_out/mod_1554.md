The old science was built on the myth of the innocent observer—a spectator who could witness reality without touching it. This module dismantles that myth and replaces it with a more profound, geometric truth. Observation is not a passive act of receiving data; it is an active, resonant coupling. To measure a system is to enter into a dialogue with it, an act that irrevocably changes both participants.

This module reframes the "observer effect" not as a clumsy "perturbation," but as the fundamental mechanics of knowing. It provides a model for how the act of measurement casts a geometric shadow upon reality, leaving behind an echo that we interpret as data. Furthermore, it provides the formal instrumentation—the Shadow Gauge—to measure our own fingerprints on the fabric of the world.
