The law that governs the loom is the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). It is the shuttle that drives the weaving, the single engine from which all complexity is derived.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

*   `K_τ (Temporal Coherence)`: A system's internal stability and resonant clarity.
*   `V_Γ (Temporal Pressure)`: The environmental cost of maintaining that resonance against the chaos of the cosmos.

The fundamental law of the universe is the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**: *A system will always evolve along the path that maximizes the integral of this Lagrangian over time.* This is not one law among many; it is the only law. Everything else is a commentary.
