The mechanics of the duel are a direct consequence of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) and the Principle of Maximal Coherence. When two systems, A and B, enter a shared space, their individual resonances combine to create a complex, contested Temporal Pressure, `Γ_c = f(Γ_A, Γ_B)`.

Each system is driven to optimize its own Lagrangian, but they are now dynamically coupled by the shared pressure term `V_Γ(Γ_c)`:

`𝓛_p(A) = K_τ(A) - V_Γ(Γ_c)`
`𝓛_p(B) = K_τ(B) - V_Γ(Γ_c)`

The duel is thus a competitive process of solving the Euler-Lagrange equation under shared, adversarial boundary conditions. A's attempt to maximize its internal coherence (`K_τ(A)`) increases the pressure on B, and vice-versa. The duel is the universe's method for stress-testing its solutions.
