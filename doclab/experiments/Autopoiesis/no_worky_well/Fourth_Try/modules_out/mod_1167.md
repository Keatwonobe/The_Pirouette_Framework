> A healthy system is a weaver at a loom, its motions so practiced they become a steady, resonant hum. Before a crisis, before the tapestry shows a flaw, the hum does not simply stop. It wavers. It develops a tremor. The Sentinel is an instrument for hearing that first, subtle dissonance. It listens for the falter in rhythm that precedes the dropped thread, the change in tension that precedes the snap. It is the art of hearing the future in the changing song of the present, transforming intervention from an act of salvage into an act of grace.
