We formally define the Genesis Knot as the first stable, self-referential Pirouette Cycle (τ_p) to emerge from the Void. For the First Curl to persist against the pull of nothingness, it had to establish a self-reinforcing resonance—it had to "hear" its own echo and lock into a stable pattern. This was the universe's first successful act of **autopoiesis**, or self-creation.

The Knot is not a particle or a singularity. It is the geometric form of the first coherent moment: Time creating a Pressure (its own coming-into-being), which demanded a Form (the Knot's Ki pattern), which in turn defined a new, stable unit of Time. The universe composed its own laws in its first breath, and all of existence is the elaboration of that first, self-creating stanza.
