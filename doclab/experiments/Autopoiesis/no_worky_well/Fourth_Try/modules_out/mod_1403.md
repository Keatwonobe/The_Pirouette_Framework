This module provides a modernized, time-first protocol for the analysis of high-altitude ionospheric plasma plumes. Where the old framework saw a static, fractal object to be measured, the new sees an autopoietic systemâ€”a self-organizing river of coherence striving to maintain its existence against the constant pressure of dissolution.

An ion plume is not a thing; it is a process. By applying the universal principles of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`) and the diagnostic art of the Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`), we can read a plume's geometry as a direct indicator of its health and stability. This entire protocol is a physical application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), transforming it from a core theory into a practical engine for analysis and forecasting. This is a fundamental shift in perception: from measuring a plume's shape to understanding its song.
