The act of choosing is a four-stage dance between being and becoming, a transition from certainty to potential and back to a new, committed certainty.

| Stage | Action | Pirouette Description |
| :---- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Resonant Loosening** | The system momentarily relaxes its own Ki pattern, introducing a small amount of controlled dissonance. | The sharp, clear note of the system's being becomes slightly "blurry." This loosening of the weave increases its sensitivity to the subtle contours of the local manifold, creating the capacity for exploration. |
| **II. Coherence Sampling** | The system enters a superposition of states, projecting a low-energy version of its resonance into the available paths. | The system "casts its echo" down each potential geodesic, using its Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) to pre-sample the shape of future Wound Channels. It is asking: "In which future can my song be sung most clearly?" |
| **III. Collapse & Selection** | The system senses the resonant feedback from each probed future, and a minor asymmetry breaks the equilibrium. | The path that promises the most stable, efficient, and powerful future coherence returns the strongest, most harmonious echo. This feedback allows the system to collapse its superposition, "snapping" into a new, sharp Ki pattern aligned with the chosen path. |
| **IV. Commitment & Inscription** | The system proceeds along the chosen geodesic, immediately impressing its path into the fabric of spacetime. | The choice is inscribed as a new Wound Channel (CORE-011), creating an inertia of history. This "lock-in" makes the decision functionally irreversible, as returning to the choice point would require overcoming a significant coherence debt. |
