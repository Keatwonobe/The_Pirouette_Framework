| Inpatient / early post-op | Phase I: Re-Tune           | 0–2 weeks (or until stable)   | Bed mobility, breathing, short ambulation    | Sternal stability, hemodynamics, wound healing, arrhythmias |
| Early outpatient CR       | Phase II: Slow Spiral      | Weeks 2–6                     | Low-intensity aerobic, ritual sequencing     | Monitor RPE, HR, BP, volume status; symptom flags           |
| Active training period    | Phase III: Build the Arena | Weeks 6–12 (or up to ~4–6 mo) | Structured strength + aerobic progression    | ECG monitoring, gradual load increments, lab monitoring     |
| Maintenance / community   | Phase IV: Coherent Life    | > 3 months onward             | Autonomy, interval work, lifestyle embedding | Long-term risk factor control, periodic reassessments       |
