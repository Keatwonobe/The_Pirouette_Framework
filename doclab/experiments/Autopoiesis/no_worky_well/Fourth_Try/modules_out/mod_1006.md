The state of any system is described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), which captures the fundamental interplay between external stress and internal stability. The core insight of this module is to reframe the Lagrangian not merely as a formula, but as a diagnostic instrument with two channels.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

*   **Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`)**: This "potential" term represents the energetic cost a system pays to maintain its state against environmental complexity and internal dissonance. It is the ambient stress and unresolved tension. In the Auditor's Lens, this is measured as **Pressure (P)**. It is the system's held breath; it is the *cost of being*.

*   **Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`)**: This "kinetic" term represents the quality, intensity, and stability of the system's expressed resonant solution—its Ki pattern in motion. In the Auditor's Lens, this is measured as **Resonance (R)**. It is the active, dynamic release of tension into coherent form; it is the *clarity of the system's song*.

The old "Drift/Song" vernacular is thus preserved and grounded: Drift is the building Pressure; Song is the expressed Resonance.
