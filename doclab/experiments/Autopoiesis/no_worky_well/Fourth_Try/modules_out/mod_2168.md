The key insight is that the interaction energy H_int depends on the rate of change of the resonance's phase as it couples to the magnetic field. A magnetic field causes the spinor Psi to precess.

Standard (Classical) Path: For a simple 360° path, the interaction energy accumulated over one cycle is proportional to the total angle of rotation, 2*pi. The spin angular momentum S is also proportional to this path. The ratio gives g=1.

Topological (Pirouette) Path: For our electron, with its exp(i*theta/2) path, a 360° rotation of the particle in physical space corresponds to only a 180° (pi) rotation of its internal phase. To complete one full cycle of its internal state (a rotation of 2*pi in its phase space), the particle must rotate 720° (4*pi) in physical space.

The Doubling Effect: The magnetic moment mu is a measure of the energy change per unit of magnetic field, which is coupled to the full 720° cycle of the resonance. However, the spin angular momentum S is conventionally defined by the physics of a 360° rotation.

When we calculate the ratio, we are comparing a phenomenon (mu) that operates on a 720° cycle to a definition (S) that operates on a 360° cycle. The magnetic moment is effectively twice as large as it "should" be for a given amount of angular momentum.

mu (operating on 720 deg) / S (defined on 360 deg) = 2

Therefore:

g = 2

The g-factor of 2 is not a magical quantum number. It is the geometric conversion factor between a system that lives in a 720° world and our 360° definitions of its properties.
