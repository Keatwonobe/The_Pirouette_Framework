To ensure the Gambit remains a tool of science and not speculation, the following guardrails are mandatory.

*   **Evidence Anchoring:** Every claim in the narrative must be rigorously tagged with its evidence grade (`High`, `Moderate`, `Low`, `Speculative`). A story built on speculation is a call for foundational research, not a basis for clinical theory.
*   **The Dissonance Ledger:** The list of unanswered questions must be kept separate and public. The purpose of the Gambit is to shrink this ledger, not to weave a story that ignores it.
*   **Narrative Refactoring:** The narrative is not sacred. As new evidence emerges, it must be ruthlessly refactored or abandoned. The version history of the narrative itself tells the story of our journey toward understanding.
*   **Falsifiability First:** The elegance of a persona must never overshadow its primary function: to generate falsifiable predictions. A story that explains everything but predicts nothing is a failure of the protocol.
