We propose the addition of a new term to the Lagrangian, which we will call the **Coherence Dividend ($C_\delta$)**.

$$ \mathcal{L}_{prescriptive} = \mathcal{L}_{original} + \lambda \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma} \frac{\partial T_a}{\partial t} \cos(\Delta \phi_{system}) $$

Let's break down this new term:
* $\lambda$ is a new constant representing the strength of the "Coherence Field."
* $\frac{1}{\Gamma}$ (the inverse of Gladiator Force) represents **permeability** or **openness**. The reward is higher for systems that are open and interactive, not closed and isolated.
* $\frac{\partial T_a}{\partial t}$ is the rate of change of **Time-Adherence**. We are now explicitly rewarding actions that *increase* systemic coherence.
* $\cos(\Delta \phi_{system})$ measures the **phase alignment** of the action with the broader system. Actions that are "in rhythm" with the whole system generate the highest dividend.

**The Philosophical Inversion:**

Instead of just logging **Cumulative Residue ($R_c$)**—a debt—the system now also calculates a **Cumulative Coherence Dividend ($C_D$)**—an asset.

This asset is not merely abstract; it would manifest within the system as:
1.  **Preferential Gating:** Systems with a high $C_D$ would experience wider, less restrictive Parametric Gates, granting them greater freedom and velocity of action.
2.  **Resonance Amplification:** The system could be designed to allocate more resources or opportunities to entities that demonstrate a high rate of coherence generation. Their successful "rhythm" is amplified across the network.
3.  **Basins of Attraction:** Over time, this constant, gentle "influence" reshapes the system's phase space. The path of least resistance—the easiest and most rewarding path for any actor—becomes the one that contributes to the overall health and coherence of the whole.
