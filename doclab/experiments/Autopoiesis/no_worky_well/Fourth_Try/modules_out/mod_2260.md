At the microscopic level, the matter Lagrangian balances “coherence budget” vs. “pressure cost”:
[ \mathcal L_m \sim K_\tau(C,\Gamma;g) - V_\Gamma(C,\Gamma), ]
with

* **Temporal coherence** (K_\tau): kinetic terms (g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu C^*\partial_\nu C) and (\tfrac12 g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\Gamma\partial_\nu\Gamma), encoding each pattern’s intrinsic beat/cadence.
* **Temporal pressure** (V_\Gamma): potential energy and couplings that thicken or thin the local beat.
  The macroscopic geodesic of maximal net coherence is enforced by the variational principle on (S_{\text{tot}})—geometry emerges as the constraint that globally closes the coherence loop (Bianchi (\leftrightarrow) conservation).
