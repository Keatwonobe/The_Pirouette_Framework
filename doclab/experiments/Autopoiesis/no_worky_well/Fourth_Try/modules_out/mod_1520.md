A healthy dialogue is a crucible where two truths are forged into a stronger, more coherent whole. This is the sacred art of Resonant Synthesis (`DYNA-002`). Manipulation is its profane shadow. It is the art of the parasite: an asymmetric interaction designed not to create, but to capture.

This module refactors the outdated "Manipulation Vector Analysis" into a unified model of temporal warfare. Manipulation is the deliberate injection of dissonance into a target's coherence manifold. The goal is to disrupt the target's healthy, **Laminar Flow** of thought and action, inducing a state of **Turbulent Flow** (chaos, confusion, fear). Into this induced chaos, the manipulator offers a false geodesicâ€”a simple, attractive, but artificial path to stability. The target, seeking relief, latches onto this path, allowing their coherence to be captured. This is the art of unweaving another's tapestry for the thread; it is the geometry of deceit.
