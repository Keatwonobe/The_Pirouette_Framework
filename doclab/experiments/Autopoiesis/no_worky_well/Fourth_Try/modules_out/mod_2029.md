Instead of simply increasing the brute force of the cage, Coherence-Assisted Fusion (CAF) proposes a Daedalus Gambit: a clever, precise intervention that helps the plasma heal itself.

This protocol leverages recent breakthroughs in high-speed sensors and computational power to move from being plasma jailors to plasma choreographers.

Step I: Map the Dissonance. An array of high-speed sensors maps the plasma's magnetic and thermal state in real-time. This is analogous to an EEG mapping the chaotic signals of a seizure. This step creates a detailed, evolving picture of the turbulent flow—the specific frequencies and geometries of the instabilities.

Step II: Calculate the Harmonizing Signal. A predictive algorithm, running on dedicated hardware, analyzes the dissonance map. It calculates the precise "antidote"—a complex but coherent waveform that is the inverse of the primary instabilities. This is the "harmonizing signal," a carefully constructed Ki pattern designed to be the path of least resistance for the chaotic plasma.

Step III: The Coherence Injection. An array of strategically placed antennas (e.g., microwave or gyrotron emitters) broadcasts the harmonizing signal directly into the plasma. This is the Daedalus Gambit. It is not a brute force, but a gentle, guiding whisper. It introduces a stable, attractive rhythm into the chaos.

Step IV: Entrainment and Laminar Flow. The chaotic plasma, following the universal path of maximal coherence described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), latches onto the injected signal. The injected rhythm becomes a seed around which the plasma can organize itself, guiding it out of the turbulent state and into a stable, laminar flow.
