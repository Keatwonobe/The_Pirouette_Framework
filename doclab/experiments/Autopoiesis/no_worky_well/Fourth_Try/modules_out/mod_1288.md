Before intervening, a Weaver must diagnose. The health of any discourse can be understood by observing the state of its coherence flow, as defined in **Flow Dynamics** (DYNA-001). This lens replaces the old, granular parameters with a single, holistic assessment.

*   **Laminar Flow (The Weaving):** The ideal state of a healthy debate. Arguments build upon one another, questions seek to clarify, and participants act in good faith toward a shared goal. Energy is directed toward construction. This is the "State of Grace" in discourse, where a synthesis is possible.

*   **Turbulent Flow (The Battlefield):** The state of combat. Characterized by logical fallacies, ad hominem attacks, and interruptions. These "dissonant injections" waste energy in the friction of egos. This is a destructive, coherence-negative state that makes synthesis impossible.

*   **Stagnant Flow (The Impasse):** A "Coherence Dam" has formed. Participants are locked into rigid positions, repeating the same points. No new information can pass between them. The discourse is paralyzed, building pressure that often leads to a collapse into turbulence or dissolution of the exchange.
