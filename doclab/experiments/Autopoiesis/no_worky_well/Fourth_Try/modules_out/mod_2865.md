This rule provides the direct, in-game reward for acting in accordance with the Prime Directive.

The Mechanic: When a player performs an action that the table agrees should be tagged as [Altruistic] in the Entropy Ledger (TLE-000), the entire party is immediately rewarded. They are "filled with visions of when they saved little Timmy from the well," and gain a temporary, shared pool of EP called the Coherence Dividend.

Pool Size: The Coherence Dividend pool contains a number of EP equal to the altruistic character's Constitution Modifier.

Usage: Any member of the party can draw from this shared pool on their turn to fuel any action. The pool must be used before the start of the altruistic character's next turn, or the unused points dissipate.

The Link to Residue: This dividend is the party's primary weapon against the rising tide of world-level Residue, creating a profound mechanical and narrative link between personal kindness and cosmic stability.
