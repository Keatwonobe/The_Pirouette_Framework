The ethical and physical distinction between these two modes is not a matter of opinion; it is a mathematical certainty, governed by the system's objective function as described by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). The "intent" of the interaction is encoded in the Lagrangian the system seeks to optimize.

**The Law of Persuasion (A Cooperative Function):**
Participants in an act of persuasion unconsciously collaborate to maximize the coherence of the *combined system*.
> Maximize  ∫ ( 𝓛_p(System A) + 𝓛_p(System B) ) dt

**The Law of Manipulation (A Parasitic Function):**
The manipulator acts to maximize their own coherence *at the direct expense* of the target's coherence.
> Maximize  ∫ ( 𝓛_p(Actor) - 𝓛_p(Target) ) dt

This is the core diagnostic. One need only ask: which equation is the interaction trying to solve? Is it building a greater whole, or is one part feeding on the other?
