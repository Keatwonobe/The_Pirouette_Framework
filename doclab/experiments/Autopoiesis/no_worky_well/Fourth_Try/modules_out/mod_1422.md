The framework provides a physical basis for the life of ideas themselves.

*   **Synthesis (Creation):** New information is forged in a **Resonant Synthesis** (CORE-012), where two or more streams of coherence merge their manifolds to form a new, more stable, and more complex pattern—an insight, a discovery, an invention.

*   **Propagation (Memory):** A pattern persists by carving a **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) into the coherence manifold. A powerful meme, for example, is a highly stable `Ki` that carves an efficient channel through the resonant structures of human minds. A shared culture or scientific paradigm is a vast, deeply carved collective Wound Channel—the geometric memory of a society that guides the flow of future thought.

*   **Erosion (Decay):** All patterns are subject to **Coherence Degradation** (CORE-013). The constant bombardment of dissonant `Γ` slowly frays the edges of the Wound Channel. Memories fade and clarity diffuses back into noise unless energy is spent to reinforce the pattern.
