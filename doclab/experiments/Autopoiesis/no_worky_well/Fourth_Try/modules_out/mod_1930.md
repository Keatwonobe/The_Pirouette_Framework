The emergence of a stable Turing pattern is a perfect, tangible demonstration of a system obeying the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). It is an optimization problem solved in the medium of chemistry.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

*   **Initial State (High V_Γ):** The uniform chemical soup is a state of high Temporal Pressure (Γ) and low Temporal Coherence (K_τ). Its temporal dissonance creates a stressful, inefficient environment that is difficult to sustain. The system's Lagrangian is deeply negative.
*   **Final State (High K_τ):** The system follows a "morphogenetic geodesic" through its chemical phase space to find a new state. The final, stable pattern is a Ki resonance of extremely high Temporal Coherence (K_τ). This state resolves the initial pressure, is predictable, stable, and persistent, representing a state of maximal "kinetic" stability.

The process of morphogenesis is the system's natural evolution to maximize the integral of `𝓛_p`. It trades the high-cost dissonance of the uniform state for the high-coherence stability of the patterned state.
