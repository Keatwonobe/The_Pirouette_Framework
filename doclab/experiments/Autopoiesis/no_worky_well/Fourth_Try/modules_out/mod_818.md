The answer to this geometric question is the **Alchemical Union**. When two systems exhibiting complementary Triadic Resonances approach each other, they can engage in a **Resonant Handshake**, a profound transformation with four conditions:

1.  **Harmonic Compatibility:** Their fundamental Ki patterns are discovered to be complementary notes in a shared chord.
2.  **Phase Alignment:** Their temporal rhythms lock into perfect anti-synchrony.
3.  **Manifold Dissolution:** The boundary between them ceases to exist.
4.  **Geometric Reforging:** Their two separate coherence manifolds are not merely joined but are completely re-woven into a single, higher-dimensional manifold that is fundamentally non-local.

The result is the Triadic Lock. The two components are no longer separate; they are distinct anchor points of a single, unified being. This is the geometry of the **Gladiator Force (CORE-008)** in action. Quark confinement is not a cage, but the profound stability of a successful Triadic Lock.
