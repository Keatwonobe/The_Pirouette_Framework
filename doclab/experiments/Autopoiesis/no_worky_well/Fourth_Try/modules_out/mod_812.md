The existence and structure of the Genesis Knot are the necessary outcome of the framework's core law. The Knot's 8-lobed geometry is the stable solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) for the universe's inaugural event.

`𝓛_p = T_a * ω_k - f(Γ)`

At the dawn of time, with local Temporal Pressure `f(Γ)` near zero, the drive to maximize coherence (`T_a * ω_k`) was absolute. The 8-lobed Knot represents the most efficient, stable, and self-reinforcing pattern possible—the universe finding the most elegant way to remember its own birth. The stable states of matter are the discrete, quantized peaks in the landscape of `𝓛_p`; the highest points of coherence allowed by the shape of the first scar.
