Healing is the act of transferring entropy to restore a damaged Health Pool.

Magical Healing: Restoring 1 HP to a target costs the healer 2 EP. One point is transferred, and one is lost to the inefficiency of the transfer.

Sacrificial Healing: A healer may spend their own HP to restore a target's HP on a 1-to-1 basis. This costs no additional EP but directly drains the healer's life force.

Natural Healing: An entity can naturally heal by dedicating their Downtime Entropy Budget (TLE-008) to recovery. The Entropy Budget to heal 1 HP is 2,500 EP, which is paid off by the character's passive ERR while resting.
