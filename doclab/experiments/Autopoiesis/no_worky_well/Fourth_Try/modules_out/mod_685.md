Each of these predictions is a unique expression of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). The universe does not follow disparate laws; it follows a single imperative.
*   The **modulated fringes** are the signature of a particle *adjusting its path* to maintain coherence.
*   The **lifetime delay** is the signature of a particle's path being *influenced by a past coherence*.
*   The **resonance plateaus** are the signature of two systems *finding a new, shared coherence*.
*   The **gravitational thumps** are the signature of a system *failing to find a stable coherence* and oscillating catastrophically.
They are four different views of the same fundamental process: the relentless, universal dance of systems seeking the most elegant and stable rhythm of being.
