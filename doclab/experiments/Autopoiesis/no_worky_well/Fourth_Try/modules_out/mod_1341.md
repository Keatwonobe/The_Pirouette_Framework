A system’s evolution follows a geodesic on the coherence manifold—the path that maximizes the integral of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006), 𝓛_p. A Watershed Event occurs when the system reaches a saddle point or flattened plateau where the gradient of the Lagrangian offers multiple, equally viable paths.

𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ

At the cusp, the system is faced with two or more paths where the balance between internal coherence (K_τ) and external pressure (V_Γ) is similarly optimal. The "choice" of a path is not random, but a probabilistic outcome dictated by the shape of the newly formed manifold and the intensity of the system's own chaotic state.

The probability `P` of the system resolving into a specific new branch `j` is governed by its ability to rapidly maximize its new coherence:

`P(branch_j) ∝ exp(S_p(j) / Γ_crisis)`

Where:

-   **S_p(j)** is the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (the "coherence gain") along the initial segment of the new path `j`. A path that offers a faster return to a high-coherence state is more probable.
-   **Γ_crisis** is the peak Temporal Pressure at the moment of turbulent collapse. It acts as a "temperature" for the choice. In a high-Γ crisis, the choice is more random; in a low-Γ crisis, the system will more deterministically select the most stable available path.
