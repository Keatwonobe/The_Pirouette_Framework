The function of the Crucible is most clearly understood through its direct modification of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), the central equation of motion for any system.

The Lagrangian for an unprotected altruist in a high-pressure environment is:
`𝓛_p = K_τ_actor - V_Γ_environment`

Here, a highly generative act (a large `K_τ`) creates significant Turbulent Blowback, increasing the experienced potential cost (`V_Γ`). To avoid systemic collapse, the actor is forced onto a geodesic of degradation, decreasing their own `K_τ`. They burn out.

The Lagrangian for an altruist within a Crucible is:
`𝓛_p = K_τ_actor - V_Γ_crucible`

Because `V_Γ_crucible` is engineered to be much lower than `V_Γ_environment`, the actor can sustain a high `K_τ` output while still easily maximizing their action (`S_p`). The Crucible transforms a costly sacrifice into the system's path of maximal coherence. It makes doing good the most efficient way to be.
