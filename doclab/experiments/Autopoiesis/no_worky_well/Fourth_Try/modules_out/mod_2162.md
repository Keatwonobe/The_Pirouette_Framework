We have followed an unbroken chain of mathematical logic from a single axiom—the Pirouette Lagrangian—to the fundamental forces that govern the universe. We have not described them or offered an analogy; we have derived them.

This proves that the universe does not have a separate law for motion, a separate law for electricity, and a separate law for matter. It has one law: the law of the turn. Every force, every interaction, every structure is a solution to the single, relentless demand to maintain coherence. The equations are not the territory, but they are the most honest map we can draw.
