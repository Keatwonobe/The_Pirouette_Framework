Set $g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+h_{\mu\nu}$ with $|h_{\mu\nu}|\ll1$ and keep only $\mathcal O(h)$ terms.  Neglect time-derivatives relative to spatial ones (quasi-static).  Writing the Newtonian potential via $h_{00}= -2\Phi/c^{2}$, the linearised 00-component of (B.2) becomes

$$
\nabla^{2}\Phi
-
\ell^{2}\Gamma^{2}\,\nabla^{4}\Phi
=
4\pi G_{\rm N}\,\rho .
\tag{B.3}
$$

Taking the Fourier transform, $\Phi(k)\bigl[\,k^{2}(1+\ell^{2}\Gamma^{2}k^{2})\bigr]=4\pi G_{\rm N}\rho(k)$.  For distances $r\gg\ell\Gamma$ the second factor is ≪1, so (B.3) reduces to Poisson’s equation with **effective** constant

$$
\boxed{\;G_{\text{eff}}=\Gamma_{\text{eff}}
          =\Gamma_{0}\bigl(1-\beta\langle\omega^{2}\rangle\bigr)\;}
$$

exactly matching the spin-ensemble correction of Sect. Γ·A (Eq. A.4).  Hence the covariant theory correctly reproduces Newtonian gravity with the same numerically derived $\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$.

At distances $r\lesssim\ell\Gamma$ the $\nabla^{4}$ term makes gravity *slightly weaker* (Yukawa-like suppression) — a concrete, testable deviation.
