T1 **Martingale of motif counts**: for any motif (M) whose insertion cost is constant under automorphisms, (M)-count minus its expected drift is a martingale.
T2 **720° return**: if holonomy around every minimal 2-sphere in the order complex is −1, then the induced representation on states is a double cover of SO(3); thus spin-½ behaviour.
T3 **Finite UV**: if (S) is a finite linear combination of local interval counts, all ultraviolet sums are finite on every finite fabric (no renormalization needed).
T4 **a_e leading term**: in a regime where holonomy fluctuations are small and approximately Gaussian, the expected holonomy defect of an electron motif satisfies
(a_e \approx \alpha_{\text{eff}}/(2\pi) + O(\epsilon)),
with (\alpha_{\text{eff}}) a ratio of interval-count covariances.
