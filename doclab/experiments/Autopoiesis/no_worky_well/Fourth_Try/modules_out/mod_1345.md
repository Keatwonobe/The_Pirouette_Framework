summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for feedback and adaptive systems.
  It reframes feedback as an autopoietic process where a system listens to its own
  echo to navigate a coherence manifold. Using Flow Dynamics, it models corrective
  action as the system's natural, Lagrangian-driven pursuit of a goal state, steering
  its own resonance to minimize dissonance.
