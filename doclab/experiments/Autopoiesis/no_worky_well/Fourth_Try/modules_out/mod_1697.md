The old model's "potential field" was a shadow of a richer reality. That reality is the **coherence manifold**, a dynamic landscape whose "elevation" at any point is defined by the value of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)**.

A system does not seek to minimize energy. It strives to climb this landscape, perpetually seeking states of higher `𝓛_p`. On this manifold, "valleys" are not low-energy states; they are regions of high Temporal Pressure, where the cacophony of the environment makes it difficult to maintain a stable rhythm. "Peaks" are states of high Temporal Coherence, where a system achieves a powerful, stable, and efficient resonance.

The "forces" that guide a system are not external pushes and pulls, but the intrinsic gradients of this manifold. A system moves not because it is forced, but because the path ahead offers a more coherent, more stable, and more resonant state of being. The trajectory is not a calculation; it is a consequence of the terrain.
