Yes. The math can be inverted.

The current framework is fundamentally **preventative**. It uses the threat of sanction (gate tightening, ritual adjudication) to deter actions that generate Dark Residue. The core motivation is avoidance of negative outcomes.

An inverted framework would be fundamentally **prescriptive** or **generative**. It would restructure the system's dynamics so that actions leading to increased global coherence are the most "natural" and "effortless." It seeks not to prevent accidents, but to make success the system's default state—a **Theory of Inevitable Coherence**.

This requires a shift in how we interpret the core Lagrangian.

$$ \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu T_a)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu \Gamma)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu \phi)^2 - V(T_a, \Gamma, \phi) + g \cdot \Gamma \frac{\partial T_a}{\partial t} \cos(\Delta \phi_{K_i}) $$

Currently, we use this to measure and contain negative perturbations. To invert it, we must add a **prescriptive term**—a "Coherence Field" that actively rewards resonance.
