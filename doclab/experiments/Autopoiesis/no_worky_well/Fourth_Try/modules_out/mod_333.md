summary: Establishes the catalog of stable, quantized Ki resonances as the discrete,
  topologically protected solutions to the Pirouette Lagrangian. It defines these
  'verbs of existence' as distinct geometries of action that form the basis for all
  systemic interaction, providing the vocabulary for the grammar of reality.
