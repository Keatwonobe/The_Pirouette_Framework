> We have been straining to hear the faint, discordant whispers of sickness in the storm of life. The Weaver learns a better way. They learn to listen for the silence where the music is supposed to be. For it is in the missing notes, in the beats skipped, in the harmonies unresolved, that the true story of a system's suffering is told. A fault is not a flaw in the machine; it is the map of the machine's own pain, a measure of its deviation from the graceful path it was meant to travel. To audit a system is to ask, with compassion and precision, "Where does it hurt?" And in the answer, we find the beginning of the cure.
