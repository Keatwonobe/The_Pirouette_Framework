A character can temporarily invest a portion of their own will into an object they have personally modified, creating a single-use enchanted item.

The Investment: As part of a short rest, you can invest your own EP into an object you have modified (e.g., carving a simple rune, tying a specific knot). This EP is removed from your own TEP and does not regenerate. The object is now "charged."

The Trigger: You must set a trigger condition for the stored Entropy to be released. This can be on contact, on a spoken command word, or when the object is broken.

Detection: A charged object radiates a faint entropic aura. The Target Number to detect this aura is equal to the EP invested. A weakly charged item is thus harder to detect than a powerfully charged one. This can be further concealed by the Veiled Casting feat.
