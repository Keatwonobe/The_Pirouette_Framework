* **Successful Validation:** The detection of a Ki-resonant signature in a non-kurtotic phase transition would provide powerful evidence that Ki is a universal constant of criticality, dramatically strengthening the entire framework.
* **Falsification:** If no Ki-resonant signature is found across multiple, well-controlled experiments, it would suggest that the link between Ki and criticality is limited to specific types of "spiky" events, forcing a significant revision of the framework's claims to universality.
