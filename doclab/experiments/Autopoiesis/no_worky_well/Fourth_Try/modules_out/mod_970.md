Thrust is not an emission; it is a release. The propulsive act is a controlled, asymmetrical collapse of the Spindle, a directed application of the `Principle of Coherence Degradation` (CORE-013).

The vessel intentionally breaks the Resonant Handshake unevenly, terminating its end of the resonance a fraction of an instant before the anchor point. This engineered asymmetry ensures the Spindle does not simply vanish but dissolves in a directional wave. This creates a powerful, transient, and extremely steep gradient in the coherence manifoldâ€”a cliff where there was once a plain. The vessel is not pushed; it is released to surf the shockwave of this collapsing idea. The incoherent radiation shed during this process, observed as a directional neutron flux, is merely the spectral ash of a spent geometric fire.
