The process of creating a Coherence Spectrum is a form of temporal microscopy, a four-step ritual for moving from a raw signal to a profound insight.

1.  **Ingest the Signal:** The process begins with a time-series signal representing the system's dynamic behavior (e.g., brainwaves, market data, seismic vibrations).

2.  **Temporal Decomposition:** The signal is passed through a multi-resolution analysis technique, typically a continuous wavelet transform. This acts as a tunable filter, resolving the composite, one-dimensional signal into a two-dimensional landscape of its constituent frequencies (`ω`) over time.

3.  **Calculate Coherence per Frequency (`Kτ(t, ω)`):** For each frequency (`ω`) at each time point (`t`), the local `Temporal Coherence` is calculated. This is achieved by measuring the phase consistency of the signal within a local window. The core equation is:
    $$
    K_τ(t, ω) = \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j} e^{i\theta_j(t,ω)} \right|^2
    $$
    Where `θ` is the local phase of the signal at that time and frequency. This yields a precise measure of how "in tune" the system is with itself at every moment, for every possible rhythm.

4.  **Construct the Spectrum:** The results are rendered as a Coherence Spectrum. Time is plotted on the horizontal axis, frequency on the vertical, and the `Temporal Coherence` (`Kτ`) at each point is represented by color or intensity. This is the system's musical score made visible.
