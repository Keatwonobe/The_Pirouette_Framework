The existence of a closed, resonant boundary naturally and inevitably leads to quantization. Within the arena of the Shell, only certain standing-wave patterns can persist. Any `Ki` that is not a stable harmonic of the resonant cavity will quickly destroy itself through destructive interference.

These stable harmonics are the system's allowed quantum states. The Shell, therefore, acts as the universe's primary mechanism for "digitizing" the continuum. It takes an infinite field of potential and gives it a discrete set of allowed expressions. The energy levels of an electron, the specific forms a protein can fold into, and the stable strategies in an ecosystem are all manifestations of this boundary-induced quantization.
