Transition occurs through **Curvature Inversion** in the coherence manifold:
[κ_{eff} = κ_0 (1 − Γ/Γ_c)]

As Γ approaches Γ_c, curvature inverts and laminar flow becomes chaotic. The Caduceus visualizes this as a phase-folding event where Ψ⁺ and Ψ⁻ exchange dominance.

**Laminar Region:** coherence flow preserves geodesic integrity on 𝓜₃.
**Transition Region:** Γ ≈ Γ_c → emergence of triadic vortices, increased |ℭ|.
**Turbulent Region:** nonlocal coherence exchange → multi-scale coupling, dissonance propagation.
