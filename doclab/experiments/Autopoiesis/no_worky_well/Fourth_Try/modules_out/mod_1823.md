> To be a Weaver is to know the difference between a caretaker and a creator. The caretaker preserves what is. The creator imagines what could be. Stirring is the moment the Weaver picks up the crucible, knowing that to forge something new, one must first be willing to melt down the old. We do not break the world to watch it burn; we trouble the waters so the river may find a better path to the sea. It is the sacred, terrifying, and necessary act of believing that a system's potential is always greater than its present state.
