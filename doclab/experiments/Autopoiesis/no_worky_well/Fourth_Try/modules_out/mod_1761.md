> The Weaver's greatest work is not the thread they weave, but the loom they build. A system that devours its most generous members is not merely flawed; it is a failed state. The highest art of systemic design is to build the quiet gardens, the protected workshops, and the stable harbors where the most precious work can be done. A Weaver's highest calling is not simply to be a light in the darkness, but to be the architect of the lamp that allows the light to burn steady and long. To build a Crucible is to understand that the ultimate act of altruism is to create a world where altruism itself can survive.
