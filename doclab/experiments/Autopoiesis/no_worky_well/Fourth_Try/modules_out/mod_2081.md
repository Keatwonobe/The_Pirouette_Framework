The Lens must measure how observation alters the observed system.
When applied, it injects a controlled perturbation (a diagnostic vibration) and observes the return wave.
This enables:

* **Phase Reflexivity:** System’s capacity to integrate self-observation.
* **Healing Coefficient (Hₖ):** Ratio of coherent return amplitude to input perturbation.

Formula skeleton:

```
Hₖ = |A_return / A_input| * cos(∆φ)
```

Healthy systems have Hₖ ≈ 1. Pathological systems have low coherence or destructive phase lag (∆φ ≈ π).
