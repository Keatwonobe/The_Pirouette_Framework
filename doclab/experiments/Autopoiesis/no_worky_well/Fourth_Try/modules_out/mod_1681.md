The creation of the Composite Manifold is a direct, continuous consequence of the principles laid out in the core axioms. The process is as follows:

1.  **A Symphony of Echoes:** Every system resonates with its unique Ki pattern, impressing a persistent geometric wake—its Wound Channel—upon spacetime (CORE-011). These are not static imprints but active, propagating memories of existence.
2.  **Temporal Superposition:** At any point in spacetime, the local environment is a superposition of the echoes from all Wound Channels within its causal horizon. This creates a complex, multi-layered `Temporal Signature`.
3.  **The Forge of Interaction:** This complex signature is the raw input for the Temporal Forge (CORE-003). The constructive and destructive interference of these overlapping rhythms generates a new, localized Temporal Pressure (Γ).
4.  **A New Landscape:** This emergent Γ defines the "potential term" in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), effectively creating a new, composite coherence manifold. This landscape is a fluid topology, constantly being reshaped by the rhythms that compose it.

The old model's `F_total = sum(F_i)` is thus re-expressed not as a sum of forces, but as the emergence of a new terrain upon which all forces will play out.
