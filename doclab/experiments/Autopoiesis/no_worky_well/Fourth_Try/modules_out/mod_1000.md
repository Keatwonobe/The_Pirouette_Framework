**Hypothesis:** Abstract ideas are not inert data but resonant structures that create distinct coherence manifolds, governed by the **Observer's Shadow (CORE-010)**.

**Finding:** A multi-dimensional analysis of philosophical texts reveals that works categorized by their conceptual nature—such as those embodying high temporal pressure ("Velcrid") versus high temporal coherence ("Radiant")—occupy distinct, separable clusters in the framework's parameter space. This proves that concepts possess a quantifiable geometry.

**Lagrangian Connection:** A powerful idea is one that offers a path of maximal coherence (high K_τ, low V_Γ) for the reader's mind. This analysis quantifies the shape of those intellectual geodesics, validating the Lagrangian's application to pure information.
