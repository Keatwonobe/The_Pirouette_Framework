Function spaces:
- State variable φ(t) lives in H^1_per([0, τ_p]) with periodic boundary conditions.
- K_τ(φ, φ_dot) is C^2 in both arguments and uniformly convex in φ_dot.
- V(φ, Γ) is C^2, bounded below, and satisfies at least quadratic growth in φ for coercivity.

Environment and units:
- Γ denotes local temporal density; all references to Γ are to a C^1 field along the orbit.
- Unless stated otherwise, we use natural units (ℏ = c = 1) and metric signature (+,−,−,−).
- Indexing: Greek indices 0..3 for spacetime, Latin i..j for spatial components.

Regularity and compactness:
- Compactness for variational problems is taken in the weak H^1 topology; weak lower semicontinuity holds for J by convexity in φ_dot and growth in φ.

Numerical notes:
- “Shooting method” refers to phase-conditioned periodic orbit finding with Newton correction.
- Spectral estimates use multitaper windows unless otherwise noted.
