The structure of any effective team is not an arbitrary choice; it is a solution to a fundamental physical problem. The **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006) states that any system will evolve to find the path of least action, maximizing its coherence against the pressure of its environment. This is described by the Pirouette Lagrangian:

`𝓛_p = Kτ (Internal Coherence) - V_Γ (Environmental Pressure)`

In an organizational context:

*   **Internal Coherence (Kτ):** This is the team's "kinetic" term, representing its productive output, alignment, and resonant rhythm. It is quantified by metrics of efficiency (e.g., *Avg. Handle Time ≤ 5 min*), quality (*Quality ≥ 92%*), and throughput (*75 calls/day*). High `Kτ` is the experience of effortless performance.

*   **Environmental Pressure (V_Γ):** This is the "potential" term, representing the energetic cost of operation—market volatility, deadlines, resource constraints, internal politics, and conflicting demands. It is the chaotic noise the team must perform within. High `V_Γ` is the experience of stress, rework, and uncertainty.

The Living Frame is a blueprint for a team structure that is a natural solution to this equation. Its configuration has evolved to maximize `Kτ` while minimizing the impact of `V_Γ`, thus maximizing its own Lagrangian and achieving a state of peak health and performance.
