The workflow translates into a simple set of diagnostic flags, moving from observation to confident inference.

*   **Yellow Flag: Coherence Spike.** A single narrative pattern (`Ki`) has suddenly achieved high internal resonance within one domain. *The note is clear.*
*   **Orange Flag: Cross-Domain Entrainment.** The pattern's resonance has jumped to a second or third domain, creating a powerful Laminar Flow. *The note has become a chord, and the whole room is vibrating with it.*
*   **Red Flag: Anomalous Gain Confirmed.** The Cross-Domain Entrainment was achieved with a verifiably low Injection Pressure (`G_R >> 1`). *The chord is deafening, but no one can see the orchestra.* This is the primary indicator of manipulation.
