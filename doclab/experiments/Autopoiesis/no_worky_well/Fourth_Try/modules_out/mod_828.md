The search requires a meticulous process of signal extraction, turning the noise of the cosmos into a clear note.

1.  **The Instrument**: Combine the long-term timing data from the world's leading Pulsar Timing Arrays (NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA) into a single dataset of the highest possible sensitivity and sky coverage.
2.  **Signal Isolation**: Apply advanced pre-whitening algorithms to the timing residuals of each pulsar. This process filters out known noise sources, including interstellar dispersion, solar wind, clock errors, and the stochastic gravitational-wave background.
3.  **The Coherent Search**: Employ a matched-filter search across the cleaned residual data, specifically looking for a faint, narrow-band, periodic signal that is **common across a significant number of pulsars**. This shared nature is the key indicator of a global, cosmological effect.
4.  **The Fingerprint: The Ki-Lock Test**: The definitive confirmation is not just finding a signal, but verifying its identity. A true detection of the cosmic heartbeat must exhibit amplitude ratios and harmonic content that are geometrically locked to the framework's fundamental Ki constants. This unique signature—the framework's mathematical fingerprint—would distinguish it from any other known astrophysical phenomenon.
