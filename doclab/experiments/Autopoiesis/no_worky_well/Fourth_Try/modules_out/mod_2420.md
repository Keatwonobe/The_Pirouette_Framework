**Summary:** MATH-026 formulates the RG engine for coherence: β-functions, fixed points, crossover with Γ, and triadic locking. It provides the predictive backbone to connect substrate microphysics with macro-level phase behavior across domains, completing the quantitative core beneath Pirouette’s universality claims.
