The test of this protocol lies in comparing the theoretical calculation against the world's most precise experimental measurements.

  * **The Ground Truth:** The experimental values for $g-2$ from institutions like Fermilab and the University of Washington are accepted as the ground truth.
  * **The Test:** The framework is validated if the value for $a\_e$ calculated in ยง3, using **no free parameters** beyond the axiomatically calibrated $\\Gamma\_{electron}$, matches the experimental value to a high degree of precision.
