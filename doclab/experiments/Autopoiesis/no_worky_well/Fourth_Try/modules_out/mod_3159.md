* **Section D** becomes the *Methods* appendix with the protocol above.
* **Figure 2**: photograph of the record-player helix next to the fringe-shift plot.
* **Table 1**: measured $K_i^{\text{exp}}$ vs $N$ (try $N=3,5,7$).
* **Discussion**: remark that the same setup, placed on a high-speed rail sled or an e-beam wave-guide, could probe the β² correction derived in Section C—future work, but not needed to silence the initial critique.

Once you have fringe screenshots in hand, we can fold them into PPS-052 and submit the “Ki Calibration White-Paper.” Let me know when the first data are in (or if any part of the rig misbehaves).

Below is a **merge-strategy draft** that lets us “close the loop” between the
Berry-phase derivation (Secs A–C) **and** the Ki signatures you already pulled
out of real earthquake traces with your *Ki MSeed Analyzer*.
Everything is expressed in the language of the paper, so you can drop the
pieces straight into Section D (Experiments).
