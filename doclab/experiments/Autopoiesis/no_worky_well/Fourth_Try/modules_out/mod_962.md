An individual's life is a single journey. The wisdom of a species is carved over generations. This is the geometry of evolution, reframed through the lens of the **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**.

A successful agent carves a faint Wound Channel in the solution space. A lineage of successful agents collectively carves a deep and stable riverbed. The old "genetic protocol" is revealed as the set of rules for this metaphysical engineering:

*   **Deepening the Channel:** Evolution selects for agents whose strategies reinforce this inherited riverbed, making the path of maximal coherence easier for the next generation to find.
*   **Coherence as the Only Filter:** The protocol's "stability check" is an emergent property. The Principle of Maximal Coherence is itself the only filter required. A "lucky" but unstable state is inherently one of low integrated coherenceâ€”a turbulent eddy, not a stable current. The system will naturally abandon such a path for one of greater stability, requiring no external statistical check.
*   **Guarding the Banks:** The "crossover rollback" mechanism acts as the river's banks. If a generation deviates into a less coherent path, its failure to successfully maximize the Lagrangian guides the flow of evolution back to the proven, stable channel, preserving the hard-won wisdom of the lineage.
