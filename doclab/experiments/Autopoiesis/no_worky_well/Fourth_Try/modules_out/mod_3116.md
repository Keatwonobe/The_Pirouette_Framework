We hypothesize that a group trained using this method:

- Exhibits increased $T_a$ under high-stochasticity environments
- Adapts quickly to fractured input domains (multi-agent, multi-signal)
- Can maintain multi-phase attention and resolve contradictions quickly
- Develops resilience to decoherence attacks (propaganda, attention fragmentation)
