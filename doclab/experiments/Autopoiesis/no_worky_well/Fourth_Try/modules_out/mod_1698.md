The **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)** is the mathematical heart of this compass. It defines the "elevation" of the coherence manifold and thus dictates the direction of flow.

**𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**

*   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ): The Engine.** This term represents the quality of the system's own internal rhythm and integrity. It is the system's "kinetic energy" in the dance of existence. A system will naturally favor paths that preserve or enhance its own temporal coherence.

*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ): The Terrain.** This term represents the "cost" of maintaining a rhythm against the background noise and constraints of the environment. High environmental pressure makes coherence difficult to sustain.

A system's path—its geodesic—is the trajectory that maximizes the integral of this function over its own cycle: `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`. It is the perfect balance point between maintaining internal integrity and managing external pressure.
