A system's health, as defined by The Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003), is the measure of its ability to sustain Laminar Flow—a state of high coherence. In the language of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), this is a system successfully navigating the geodesic that maximizes its action, `S_p`. Systemic failures are not typically death by a thousand cuts; they are a cascade originating from a single, critical fracture.

A bottleneck is a geometric feature in the coherence manifold that forces the system off this geodesic. It is a point of high friction, a "coherence dam" that introduces turbulence and dissonance. Each encounter with a bottleneck exacts a cost, causing a sharp, measurable drop in the system's coherence (`Kτ`). This loss of coherence is synonymous with a loss of information and an increase in local entropy (CORE-013).

The Pareto Probe, therefore, is not a mere statistical tool. It is a physical instrument for mapping the landscape of coherence loss. It identifies and ranks the specific events, actors, or processes that are most "expensive" in the Lagrangian's economy, allowing an analyst to see the system not by its average behavior, but by its moments of greatest failure.
