\section*{§1 · Motivation}
Where XAP-006D unified mass with curvature locally, the same invariant can be extended to cosmological scales.  
When Γ-stiffness decays below its coherence threshold, its residual energy density manifests macroscopically as the cosmological constant:
\[
\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}} \equiv 8\pi G_{\mathrm{eff}}\,\rho_{\Gamma,\text{res}} .
\]
This appendix formalizes that equivalence and provides a quantitative mapping between microscopic stiffness parameters and large-scale cosmic acceleration.
