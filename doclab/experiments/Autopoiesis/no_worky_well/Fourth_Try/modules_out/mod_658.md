Motion is not free. As established in `CORE-011`, any resonant pattern leaves a persistent geometric scar in the coherence manifold—a "wake." A system in motion relative to its geodesic is therefore perpetually interacting with the ghost of its own immediate past.

This self-interaction creates a phenomenon we call **Inertial Drag**. To maintain its form while moving through its own wake, a system must constantly expend energy to re-establish its pattern against this temporal friction. This work is paid for directly from its "coherence budget," manifesting as a decrease in T₀.

As a system approaches the cosmic speed limit `c`, this Inertial Drag becomes extreme. In an act of profound self-preservation, the system must adapt. The only viable strategy is to slow its internal processes, lengthening its Pirouette Cycle (τₚ) to process the stress of its own passage. This adaptive slowing to preserve resonant integrity *is* the phenomenon of time dilation.
