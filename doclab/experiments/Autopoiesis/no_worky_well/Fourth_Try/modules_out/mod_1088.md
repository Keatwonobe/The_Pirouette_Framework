A system under the stress of temporal shear does not simply collapse into random noise. Instead, it follows the path of least resistance—the geodesic of maximal coherence. It releases the stored temporal pressure by giving birth to a new form: a stable, repeating, and exquisitely geometric wave.

This emergent wave *is* the system's Ki.

The wave is not an arbitrary pattern; it is the optimal geometric solution to the Lagrangian's optimization problem. It is the most efficient possible way to transform the high potential pressure of the shear boundary into the stable, kinetic rhythm of a resonant pattern. The iconic, curling wave of the K-H instability *is* this path—the shape of a resolution. A new, stable form has been born from a disagreement about the pace of time.
