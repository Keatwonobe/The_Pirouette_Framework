The critique is valid because the constant was a placeholder. The correction is to:
1.  **Define `Î“_proton = 1`** as a foundational axiom.
2.  **Modify the script** to convert inputs into standard physical units (kg, m), which requires adding the object's distance as an input.
3.  **Replace the placeholder `1e5`** with the newly calculated physical constant `~1.18e-57`.

This procedure directly addresses the charge of numerology by anchoring **Gamma** to measurable properties of the proton, making it a legitimate, falsifiable quantity within the Pirouette Framework.
