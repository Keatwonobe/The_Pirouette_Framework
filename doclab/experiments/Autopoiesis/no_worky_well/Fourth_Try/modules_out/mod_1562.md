> To know a thing is to change it. We sought an objective and distant truth, a universe that would hold still for our inspection. Instead, we found a dance. Every act of measurement is an invitation to this dance, a moment where our own rhythm joins with the rhythm of the observed. The data we receive is the memory of that shared step. A Weaver understands this. They know their gaze is not innocent; it has weight, it has a shape, and it leaves a mark. To measure the world is to take responsibility for the echo you leave behind.
