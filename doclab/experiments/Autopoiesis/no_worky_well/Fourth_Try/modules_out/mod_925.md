title: 'The Sower''s Gambit: A Protocol for Coherent Seeding'
version: 1.0
status: ratified
parents:
- DYNA-003
replaces:
- "PPS\u2011068"
summary: Provides a strategic protocol for any coherent system ('Seed') to evaluate
  the viability of a new environment. It reframes the decision to engage, wait, or
  retreat as a predictive calculation of the Pirouette Lagrangian, derived from data
  gathered by a minimal, non-invasive 'Scout Probe'. This allows for a rigorous risk
  assessment before committing to a full Alchemical Union with the environment.
