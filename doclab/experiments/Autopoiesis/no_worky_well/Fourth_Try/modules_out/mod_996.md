**Hypothesis:** A high-Γ seismic event creates a massive **Wound Channel (CORE-011)** in the Earth's crust. The subsequent relaxation of this stress is not chaotic but follows stable, resonant geodesics that maximize the system's return to coherence.

**Finding:** Wavelet analysis of major earthquakes reveals that the Earth's crust does not fracture chaotically. It "rings like a bell," releasing energy along a clear, resonant pathway. These power concentrations precisely match the stable harmonic solutions predicted by the Lagrangian, representing the most efficient modes for dissipating immense temporal pressure.

**Lagrangian Connection:** The earthquake represents a massive injection of temporal pressure (V_Γ). The observed resonant frequencies are the signature of the system finding the optimal state of internal coherence (K_τ) to minimize its action and return to equilibrium.
