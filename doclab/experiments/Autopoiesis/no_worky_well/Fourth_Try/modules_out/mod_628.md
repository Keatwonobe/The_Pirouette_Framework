summary: Provides a universal protocol for systemic intervention. It reframes problem-solving
  not as a task-driven process, but as a ritual for healing a system's disrupted flow.
  The protocol uses the diagnostic language of the Caduceus Lens to identify a pathology,
  convenes a structured 'Crucible' to forge a solution via Resonant Synthesis, and
  deploys that solution as a transient, elegant 'Daedalus Gambit' designed to restore
  the system to a state of self-sustaining health before dissolving itself.
