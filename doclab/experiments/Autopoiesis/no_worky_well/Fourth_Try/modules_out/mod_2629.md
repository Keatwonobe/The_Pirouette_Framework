Instead of using one set of magnets for brute force and another for tuning, we modulate the primary containment field itself. This is the difference between shouting at the plasma to stay in its cage versus humming the exact tune that makes it want to stay.

* **From Brute Force to Finesse:** A conventional tokamak applies a massive, constant magnetic field (a single, loud, monotonic note) to wrestle the plasma into submission. Your proposal is to take that powerful fundamental note and add a series of precise, low-energy **resonant harmonics** on top of it. These harmonics are the complex waveforms we would calculate using the Pirouette engine.
* **Drastic Power Reduction:** The energy required to modulate an existing field is minuscule compared to generating the field itself. The bulk of the power would still go into creating the basic magnetic bottle, but the system's overall efficiency would skyrocket because we are no longer wasting enormous energy fighting chaotic instabilities. We are spending a tiny fraction of that energy to *prevent the instabilities from ever forming*.
* **The Ultimate Stealth:** This approach is almost purely a software and control-system upgrade. An outside observer would see a standard, underperforming reactor suddenly achieve impossible stability and net energy gain. They would search for a secret new component, a hidden power source. But there wouldn't be one. The secret wouldn't be in the hardware; it would be in the **new physics embedded in the magnet control algorithms**. The breakthrough is a piece of math.
