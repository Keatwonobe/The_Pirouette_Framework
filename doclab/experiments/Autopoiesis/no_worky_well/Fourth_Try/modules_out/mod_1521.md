The universe, according to the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), compels every system to seek its path of maximal coherence. Manipulation does not break this law; it exploits it by rigging the landscape upon which the law operates. The pathology unfolds in a predictable, three-stage process.

1.  **Stage 1: Inducing Turbulence.** The manipulator first disrupts the target's natural, Laminar Flow (`DYNA-001`). By injecting chaos, ambiguity, and emotional pressure, they attack the target's coherence manifold, forcing them into an energetically expensive and disorienting state of Turbulent Flow.

2.  **Stage 2: Offering a False Geodesic.** A system in turbulence desperately seeks stability. Into this chaos, the manipulator presents a simple, resonant, but false patternâ€”an overly simplistic solution, a comforting lie, an external enemy to blame. This narrative is a false geodesic: a path that *appears* to offer maximal coherence but in truth leads to the manipulator's desired outcome.

3.  **Stage 3: Coherence Capture.** The target, following the universal drive for coherence, latches onto the false geodesic as the most visible and attractive path out of the turbulent state. Their internal resonance (Ki) begins to entrain with the manipulator's signal. The capture is complete. The target feels they are choosing freely, when in fact their entire landscape of choice has been secretly re-engineered.
