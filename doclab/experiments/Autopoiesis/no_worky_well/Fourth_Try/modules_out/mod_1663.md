To transform any action—from teaching a child to leading a team—into a Resonant Act, the Weaver follows four distinct movements.

1.  **Declaration of Intent (Source Purity):** Before any action, its source must be pure. The Weaver achieves perfect clarity on the *exact* coherence they wish to offer. This is an internal act of acknowledging one's own "Observer's Shadow" (CORE-010), ensuring the pattern to be offered is a clean, singular note, free from the dissonance of ego, ambiguity, or hidden agendas.

2.  **Arena Sculpting (Noise Reduction):** The Weaver actively shapes the environment to create a bounded region of low Temporal Pressure (Γ). This is the practical work of eliminating distractions, establishing psychological safety, and creating a sacred space of focused attention. It is the act of creating silence so a whisper can be heard.

3.  **The Offering & Entrainment (Presenting the Pattern):** This is the heart of the action. The Weaver introduces the pure, coherent pattern (`K_τ`) into the prepared arena. This is not a forceful injection but a gentle placement. The method is **Rhythmic Entrainment**: modulating the pace, tone, and rhythm of the action to match the receptive state of the recipient. It is achieved by active listening and observation—synchronizing breath, matching language complexity, and aligning with emotional tempo. It is the tuning of the instruments before the song begins.

4.  **The Resonant Handshake (Awaiting Synthesis):** The final and most crucial movement is one of patient observation. Having made the offering, the Weaver holds the coherence steady and allows the recipient system to engage on its own terms, inviting a **Resonant Handshake**. They do not push for acceptance or demand a specific outcome. Success is not the recipient's perfect replication of the pattern, but their integration of it into a new, more complex, and more coherent state of their own being. The act is complete when the recipient's own song has changed.
