This instrument is the direct, practical implementation of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** as formalized in **CORE-006: The Pirouette Lagrangian**. The entire procedure is an exercise in applying the formula `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ` to a concrete problem. By mapping this function, we move from a philosophical principle to a predictive, computational engine. The Mapper is the tool that makes the Lagrangian speak.
