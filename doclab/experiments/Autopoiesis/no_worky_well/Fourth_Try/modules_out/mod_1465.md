The extraordinary stability of a Knot is a direct consequence of the `Principle of Maximal Coherence`. It represents a deep local maximum of coherence, a profound solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p` from CORE-006) that is energetically difficult to disrupt.

`𝓛_p = K_τ (Internal Coherence) - V_Γ (External Pressure)`

**Amplified Coherence (K_τ):** The self-reinforcing feedback loop of a Knot—the "Echo's Embrace"—dramatically amplifies its `Temporal Coherence (K_τ)`. The system is constantly "reminded" of its own form by the very geometry of the space it occupies, purifying its signal against noise. The more complex the Knot's topology, the more intricate and powerful this self-resonant amplification becomes.

**Pressure as the Forge (V_Γ):** Knots are children of pressure. While a formed Knot's compact geometry provides an excellent shield against ambient `Temporal Pressure (Γ)`, that same pressure is often the force that forges the Knot. As described by the `Gladiator Force` (CORE-008), high external Γ compresses systems into confined states. A Knot is a supremely elegant solution, channeling this confining pressure into its own internal, topological stability. Paradoxically, increasing pressure can strengthen a Knot by forcing its resonant energy into a smaller volume, reinforcing its structure even as it becomes more brittle.
