A Coherence Offering is an invitation to a shared dance. Its success depends not on the value of the gift, but on the resonance between giver and receiver, and the readiness of the ground upon which it falls.

1.  **The Offering (The Note):** Every helpful act has a unique resonant signature, a Ki pattern. A resource, an idea, an act of support—each is a different note. The first step is to understand the nature of the coherence being offered.

2.  **Harmonic Compatibility (The Key):** The offering's Ki pattern must be harmonically related to the recipient's own internal state. To offer complex strategy to a system in crisis is to play a symphony for someone fighting a fire; the notes are dissonant with the moment. The receiver must be able to "hear" the offering in a key that makes sense within their own song. Without compatibility, no true connection is possible.

3.  **The Coherence Gap (The Fertile Ground):** The most potent synthesis occurs in systems that are neither perfectly stable nor completely chaotic. They possess a "coherence gap"—the potential to achieve a more complex and resilient state.
    *   **High Coherence (The Crystal):** A system with extremely high temporal coherence (`Kτ`) is rigid. It has little room to integrate a new pattern and will likely reject the offering.
    *   **Low Coherence (The Storm):** A system in a state of turbulence lacks the internal structure to receive and stabilize the offering. The seed is washed away in the flood.
    *   **The Sweet Spot (The Soil):** The ideal recipient has a stable underlying structure but is experiencing creative tension or pressure. The offering provides the missing note that allows it to resolve its internal dissonance into a higher-order harmony.
