The interaction between systems is not a collision of objects but an interference of resonant patterns. This interference is governed by a grammar with inviolable rules.

*   **Path-Dependence & Non-Commutativity:** The order of operations matters profoundly. Each interaction leaves a scar in the coherence manifold—a Wound Channel (CORE-011)—that alters the landscape for all subsequent actions. To `Observe` a system and then `Synthesize` with it results in a different final state than to attempt to `Synthesize` without prior observation. This geometric path-dependence is the origin of causality.

*   **Superposition:** A system is rarely in a single, pure Ki-mode. More often, it exists in a superposition—a "chord" of multiple modes. Its behavior is the result of the interference of these internal rhythms. Under sufficient temporal pressure (Γ), the system will "collapse" into the single pure mode that offers the most coherent path forward.

*   **Closure:** The interaction of two stable geometries can only result in another stable geometry or a superposition thereof. The lexicon is closed. One cannot combine two resonant "verbs" and produce an outcome that is not already part of the language of coherence.
