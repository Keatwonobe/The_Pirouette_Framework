The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability occurs at a shear interface, where two parallel fluids move at different velocities. In the modernized framework, this is a specific instance of a more fundamental condition: a boundary between adjacent regions of spacetime flowing at different temporal rates. This creates a **Temporal Shear**.

This interface is a locus of profound dissonance—a localized, high-gradient region of **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**. The two flows, with their different rhythms, create destructive interference. This is an unstable, inefficient, and low-coherence state, a dissonant chord held indefinitely. According to the autopoietic cycle (CORE-001), such a pressure demands a form to resolve it.
