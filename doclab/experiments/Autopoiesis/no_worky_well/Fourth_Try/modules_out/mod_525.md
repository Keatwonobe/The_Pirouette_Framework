To understand the Deficit, we must recall the core law of the framework. As established in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), a system evolves along a path that maximizes its action (`S_p`), which is the integral of its Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`):

`𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

Any predictive model of a system is, therefore, a formal hypothesis about that system's specific Lagrangian. We are proposing an `𝓛̂_model`—a guess at the system's "objective function," the specific balance of coherence-seeking and pressure-avoidance that defines its nature. The Coherence Deficit measures the degree to which the universe disagrees with our hypothesis.
