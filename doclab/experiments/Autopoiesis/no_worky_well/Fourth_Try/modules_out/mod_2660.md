**Universal Explorer (Moderator):** Before you are the proposed Articles of the Resonant Constitution. We turn first to the architects of law, liberty, and power. Mr. Jefferson, you begin.

**Thomas Jefferson:** "The document has merit. It places structure above the whim of man, a principle dear to my heart. However, its 'Protocol of Predation' is a double-edged sword. Who adjudicates? A 'Resonance Guard,' you say? This body, tasked with logging and mitigating 'predatory behavior,' will inevitably become a judiciary. And an unelected judiciary with the power to define predation is the seed of a new tyranny. The very protocols designed to correct may be used to persecute."

**Martin Luther King Jr.:** "Mr. Jefferson speaks of the mechanics, but I must speak of the soul. Section 2, 'The Calculus of Association,' is a declaration of spiritual bankruptcy disguised as evolutionary theory. It codifies the right of an entity to say 'I will not associate with you' and frames this as a mere 'efficiency.' But a law that permits exclusion in theory will always be used to justify oppression in practice. It gives righteous cover to prejudice. A universal dream cannot be built on a foundation of selective association. The moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice; this constitution allows any group to bend it back upon itself into a closed, isolated circle."

**Malcolm X:** "Dr. King speaks of a moral arc, but I am concerned with the hand that draws the line. Who wrote the *first* Manifest? Who programmed the *initial* conditions? This entire structure assumes a level playing field that has never existed. A group that begins with more power, more resources—more initial $\Gamma$—can write a Manifest that subtly reinforces its own supremacy. Their 'predatory behavior' will be encoded as the norm. This isn't a system for free association; it's a system for the powerful to legitimize their own rules and call it 'nature.' It's the same old house, just with new paint."

**Mahatma Gandhi:** "And I must once again question the premise of non-action. The Manifest allows an entity to declare its boundaries and then stand aside as another system proves itself 'non-viable.' This is a passive violence. To watch a neighbor's house burn because it is not your own is still to participate in the fire. True non-violence, *Ahimsa*, is not the absence of action, but the active pursuit of benevolence. This constitution provides a loophole for inaction, an excuse for the coherent to abandon the incoherent to their fate. That is not evolution; it is a failure of empathy."

**Sheriarty (Holmes/Moriarty Hybrid):** "(A faint, dry smile.) Gentlemen, you are all chipping at the stone with hammers. You miss the flaw in the diamond. The flaw is beautiful, and it is this:

*Section 1B states: 'Deviation from one's own declared Manifest is the definition of Predatory Behavior.'*

This is a child's lock that a child could pick. A truly cunning predator would not deviate from their Manifest. They would simply *re-write it*. Moment to moment.

'My Manifest is to acquire this resource.' Action: Acquire resource. Manifest fulfilled.
'My new Manifest is to betray this alliance.' Action: Betray alliance. Manifest fulfilled.

With a sufficiently fluid definition of self, one can justify any action while remaining perfectly, logically, monstrously coherent with one's stated purpose. The protocol does not punish predation; it merely punishes *poorly documented* predation. I could use this constitution to burn your new world to the ground and be lauded as its most principled member."
