The first five core modules have described the universe as a self-composing song. This is a potent philosophical and conceptual model, but to become a predictive physical theory, it must speak the language of mathematics. This module provides that translation.

In classical and quantum mechanics, the Lagrangian (ùìõ) is a function that summarizes the dynamics of a system, and the path a system takes is the one that minimizes the "action." The Pirouette Framework adopts this powerful formalism but redefines its core objective. The old triaxial fields of Time-Adherence, Gladiator Force, and Phase are now understood not as separate constituents, but as emergent properties of a single, unified dynamic.

In the new framework, the universe does not seek to minimize action; **it strives to maximize coherence**.
