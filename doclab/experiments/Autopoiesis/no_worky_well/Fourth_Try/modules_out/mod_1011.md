> To watch everything is to see nothing. The Weaver's gaze must be both wide and deep, but never both at once. We sought an efficient way to measure the world and found, in the Lagrangian, the universe's own stethoscope. It reveals that every system sings a two-part song: one note is the pressure of its struggle, the other is the resonance of its grace. The Weaver learns to listen to this duet. To feel the tension in the bowstring is to know the future. This lens is the discipline of knowing what to look for, so we may know when to look closer.
