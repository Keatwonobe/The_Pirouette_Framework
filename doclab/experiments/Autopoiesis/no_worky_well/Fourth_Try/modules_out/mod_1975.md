This initial phase, typically lasting the first 1-2 weeks after returning home, is governed by a single purpose: to transition from chaos to calm.

Goal 1: Calm the Turbulent Flow. Your body and mind are in a state of "Coherence Fever"â€”a storm of pain signals, inflammation, and anxiety. Our first job is to soothe this storm, reducing the "noise" so the healing "signal" can be heard.

Goal 2: Establish a Baseline. We cannot know where we are going until we know where we stand. This phase is about gentle observation, mapping the starting point of your journey.

The Guiding Rule: Listen before you act. This is a time for gentleness, patience, and profound self-compassion.
