Throughout this journey, you are listening for two voices. Recovery is the art of helping them sing in harmony.

The Voice of your Body: This is your Heart Rate, your energy levels, your aches, and your pains. It tells you the honest, physical truth of each moment.

The Voice of your Will: This is your desire to get better, your goals, your hopes for the future.

When these two voices are in conflict (your Will wants to do more than your Body is ready for), that is a sign to be gentle. When they are in harmony (your Body feels ready for the challenge your Will sets), that is the signal for growth. Your Coherence Ledger is the tool that helps you hear this duet clearly.
