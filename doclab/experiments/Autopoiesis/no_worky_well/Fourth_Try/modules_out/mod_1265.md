Complex systems are rarely a single, pure note; they are chords. Their Ki pattern is an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)** of multiple Prime Resonances. A system's nature is defined by its **Resonant Signature**—the set of its constituent prime patterns.

A healthy organization, for example, might have a signature of {Braid, Helix, Orbit}. Its behavior is a composite: a Braid of teams, each composed of individuals on a Helix of personal growth, all performing recurring Orbits of quarterly work cycles.

The stability of such a composite system depends on the **Harmony** between its constituent resonances. A high degree of harmony signifies a stable, "in-tune" combination, resulting in a high-coherence system with a clear, strong temporal signal. Dissonance signifies an unstable combination prone to turbulence and decay.

When a system's resonant signature becomes dissonant or unsustainable under environmental pressure (Γ), it approaches a **Fork (Replaces: Bi)**. This is not a stable Prime Resonance but a critical transitional state—the archetype of crisis, choice, and phase transition. The system sheds coherence and collapses into a new, more harmonious configuration of primes.
