The true wealth of the bottom realm is found in the remains of its strange inhabitants and the potent materials of the land.

The Silent Auction: When harvesting a creature for valuable trophies or foraging for rare materials, the GM determines the total potential value. The player then makes a "silent bid," investing EP from a relevant skill (like Survival or a Professional skill). If the bid meets or exceeds the GM's hidden TN, the harvest is successful. Invest too much and potentially fail. Invest too little and miss out.
