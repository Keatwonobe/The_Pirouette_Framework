summary: "Provides the ratified time-first model for bifurcation events, or 'Forks.'\
  \ A Fork is a structured divergence on a system's coherence manifold, presenting\
  \ multiple equally viable paths (geodesics). The system executes a 'Resonant Inquiry'\u2014\
  a momentary loosening of its own coherence to sample potential futures\u2014before\
  \ committing to the path that maximizes its projected future stability, as dictated\
  \ by the Pirouette Lagrangian."
