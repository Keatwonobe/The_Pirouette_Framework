Once the system's dynamics are expressed as Pirouette fields, we can precisely identify the sources of instability. Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA) is the surgical tool for this task. It inverts the classic 80/20 rule to find the critical few causes responsible for the majority of coherence loss.

The Protocol (Pinpointing the Bottleneck):

Quantify Impact: The RPA engine first calculates an "impact score" for every event or feature in the data stream, measuring how much each one perturbed the system's Time-Adherence (T 
a
â€‹
 ). This creates a direct, quantitative link between a specific event and its effect on the system's overall health.

Identify the Critical Few: The algorithm then sorts these impacts in descending order and identifies the smallest possible subset of events that accounts for a user-defined majority (typically 80%) of the total coherence loss.

Generate the Report: The output is a simple, actionable list of the system's primary bottlenecks. It tells the Weaver exactly where to focus their attention to achieve the greatest healing effect.

RPA is the instrument that turns the "how it resonates" of field dynamics into the "why it's breaking" of a concrete diagnosis.
