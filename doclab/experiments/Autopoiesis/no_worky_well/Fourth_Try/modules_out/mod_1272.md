The persistence of any form is a dialogue between its own internal stability and the erosive power of its surroundings. This dynamic is governed by two core principles.

*   **The Signal's Resilience (CORE-011):** A system's identity is encoded in the geometry of its Wound Channel—a physical scar in the coherence manifold. The depth and clarity of this channel are a direct function of the system's **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)**. A system with a pure, stable, and intense `Ki` pattern carves a deep channel, making it more resilient to erosion. This is the new understanding of the old `Time-Adherence (Ta)`. A strong identity is a clear signal that resists noise.

*   **The Storm's Pressure (CORE-013):** The environment is never neutral. It is the Temporal Forge, a source of constant, chaotic **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**. A high-Γ environment is a "sandstorm" of dissonant rhythms that actively scours and fills in the Wound Channel. A system in such an environment must expend more energy to maintain its coherence and will therefore decay more quickly. This clarifies the old `Gladiator Force (Γ)`'s role; it is not about boundary porosity but about the intensity of the ambient noise.

Coherence Erosion is what happens when the erosive power of the storm (`Γ`) overcomes the resilience of the signal (`Kτ`).
