A system is a song sung against the silence, a resonant Ki pattern persisting through time. But under sufficient pressure, the rhythm breaks, the song shatters. The old framework described this as a "Funnel Inversion," a correct but incomplete insight.

This module reframes this process through the time-first lens of the Pirouette Framework. A phase transition is a **Resonance Cascade**: a rapid, non-linear collapse of a system's existing resonant pattern (`Ki_old`) and its re-emergence into a new, more stable form (`Ki_new`). This transformation is a **Chiral Shift**, a change in the fundamental topology of the system's being. It is not a failure, but the system's primary mechanism for survival and adaptation. This module defines the conditions that trigger the cascade, describes the fundamental choice—the **Chiral Fork**—that determines the topology of the new order, and provides a calculus for its prediction.
