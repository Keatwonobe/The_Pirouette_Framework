The classical equations are the tools used to measure the physical properties of the coherence landscape.

**Resonant Hierarchy Distribution (Zipf's Law):**
The probability `f(r)` of observing the item with rank `r` is governed by the Coherence Gradient `α`.
$$ f(r) = \frac{C}{r^{\alpha}}, \quad C = \biggl(\sum_{r=1}^{N}r^{-\alpha}\biggr)^{-1} $$

**Maximum Likelihood Estimator for the Coherence Gradient (`α`):**
The most accurate method for calculating `α` from `n` observations `{x_i}` above a minimum value `x_min`.
$$ \hat\alpha = 1 + n\biggl[\sum_{i=1}^n\ln\frac{x_i}{x_{\min}}\biggr]^{-1} $$
