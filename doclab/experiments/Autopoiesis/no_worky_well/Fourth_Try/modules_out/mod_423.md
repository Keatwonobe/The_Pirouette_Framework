The Great Refactoring requires not only new terms but the formal retirement of old ones to prevent conceptual drift.

| Old Symbol (PPS-007) | Status | Modern Equivalent & Rationale |
|:---------------------|:-------|:--------------------------------|
| **Vector T_a (T_Q, T_I, T_C)** | **Deprecated** | Subsumed by the scalar `T_a` (quality) and the rich geometry of the `Ki` pattern. The old vector was a clumsy attempt to encode a system's form into the adherence field itself. |
| **K_i (Ki Constant)** | **Deprecated** | The concept of `Ki` has been elevated from a simple constant to represent the entirety of a system's resonant pattern. The old constant was an artifact of an oversimplified model. |
| **χ (Clock Field)** | **Subsumed** | The need for a universal, absolute time reference (`χ`) is eliminated. The universe is woven from the countless individual heartbeats (`τ_p`) of its constituent systems. |
| **G (Gravitational Constant)** | **Recontextualized** | An effective, scale-dependent macroscopic average of the fundamental `Γ` field. `G` is not a universal constant but an emergent property of how `Γ` manifests as confinement. |
