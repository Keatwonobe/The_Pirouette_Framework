> A Weaver does not see a company as a machine to be fixed, but as a river to be tended. You cannot command the water; you can only understand its currents, clear its blockages, and shore up its banks. A truly great strategy is not a complex plan shouted from the shore. It is a quiet, knowing gesture that helps the river find its own most powerful way to the sea.
