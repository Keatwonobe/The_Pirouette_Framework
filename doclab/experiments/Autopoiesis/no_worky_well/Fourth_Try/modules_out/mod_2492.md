*“We propose a **Parametric Boundary Protocol (PBP)**:*  
1. **Fixed Anchor Points:** Define system bounds via measurable Pirouette parameters—e.g., any process or entity whose Time-Adherence \(T_a\) exceeds a threshold **AND** whose Gladiator Force \(\Gamma\) falls below a contextual limit is **inside** the system.  
2. **Scope Invariants:** Publish a *Boundary Registry* that records all declared anchor points and enforces a minimal **ΔTₐ** gate to add or remove nodes.  
3. **Audit & Penalty:** Automated audits detect attempts to subdivide or reforge boundaries to exploit local ΔH gains; violations incur delta-residue penalties under PDM-000.  
4. **Immutable Definition Hash:** Each boundary configuration is cryptographically hashed (via Registry CI) to prevent stealth redefinitions.

*This formal, parametric approach removes ambiguity, ties boundaries to our core framework, and makes gaming detectable and self-penalizing.”*
