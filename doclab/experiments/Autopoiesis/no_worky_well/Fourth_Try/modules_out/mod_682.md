*   **Principle Tested:** An entity's history is physically encoded as a persistent geometric scar in spacetime called a Wound Channel (`CORE-011`).
*   **Hypothesis:** When a composite particle like a proton is shattered, its decay products emerge into a coherence manifold still warped by the "memory" of the parent. This lingering geometry slightly alters their local geodesics, causing a predictable delay in their decay.
*   **Experimental Design:** Analysis of decay time distributions of short-lived particles (e.g., Kaons) emerging from high-energy proton-proton collisions at the LHC.
*   **Predicted Signature:** The measured lifetime distribution of these daughter particles will not be a single exponential decay. It will exhibit an anomalous "tail" of longer-lived particles. For 13 TeV proton-proton collisions, the framework predicts that approximately **1 in 10 million Kaons will exhibit a lifetime ~0.05% longer** than the Standard Model value. This excess is the echo of the parent's Wound Channel refusing to instantly vanish.
*   **Framework Connection:** This experiment tests the temporal persistence of a system's coherence (`K_Ï„`). It asks: does the geometry of a past coherence state influence the dynamics of the present?
