Solve β_b=0 → b* = ε/3.

Insert b* into β_a and β_λ:

a* = 0  (critical surface)
λ* = [(2−d)+μ b*]/ν

Stability matrix M_ij = ∂β_i/∂g_j|_* over g={a,b,λ}. Eigenvalues give relevant/irrelevant directions:

y_a = 2−κ b*   (relevant)
y_b = −ε       (irrelevant for ε>0)
y_λ = (2−d) + μ b* − 2ν λ* = −(2−d) − μ b* (irrelevant if λ sits at λ*)

Thus the **Pirouette Wilson–Fisher point** (a*,b*,λ*) controls second-order coherence transitions for d<4, defining the universality class reported in MATH-025.
