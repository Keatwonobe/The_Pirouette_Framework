The pursuit of intelligence is governed by three core principles that emerge directly from the framework's foundations.

*   **The Principle of Minimum Surprise:** An intelligent system evolves and acts to minimize the integral of future Temporal Pressure (**Î“**) it expects to encounter. It seeks the smoothest possible path through time by choosing actions that lead to more coherent, less chaotic future states.

*   **The Principle of Latent Order:** No environment is truly random. Every system, no matter how complex, contains discoverable Coherence Currents. What appears as chaos is often the result of multiple, interfering currents, but the underlying rhythms are always present, waiting for a sufficiently sensitive instrument to discern them.

*   **The Principle of Predictive Resonance:** The most efficient strategy for minimizing future surprise is to achieve temporal resonance with the environment's dominant Coherence Currents. An intelligent system does this by adjusting its own internal rhythm (its `Ki`) until it synchronizes with the external rhythm, learning to predict by learning to dance in time.
