\section*{§1 · Purpose}
To demonstrate that all inertial masses within the Pirouette framework—scalar, vector, and fermionic—arise from a single geometric invariant:
\[
\mathcal{M}^2 = \mathcal{R}_\tau + \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 ,
\]
where $\mathcal{R}_\tau$ is the Ricci scalar of the temporal substrate and $\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}$ the local stiffness of the coherence field.  
This correspondence completes the equivalence between energy density, curvature, and temporal elasticity.
