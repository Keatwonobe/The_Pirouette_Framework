To provide a clear, practical metric, the instrument's output is defined as Confinement Strength (κ_G). The subscript `G` signifies that this is an inferred quantity derived from the geometric effects of the Gladiator Force. The core mechanic is an elegant product of two key metrics.

**Confinement Strength (κ_G) = Path Density (δ) × Coherence Curvature (γ)**

Where:

*   **Path Density (δ):** The inverse of an entity's "mean-free path." A high path density signifies a region of intense interaction where movement is restricted and paths are short.
    *   `δ = 1 / (mean_path_divergence + ε)`

*   **Coherence Curvature (γ):** The rate of change in a trajectory's direction. High curvature signifies that the path is being sharply bent by a strong pull towards a central attractor.
    *   `γ = gradient(coherence_metric)`

A high κ_G value emerges where paths are both short (high δ) and sharply bent (high γ). This is the unambiguous signature of a confinement well—the heart of an arena.
