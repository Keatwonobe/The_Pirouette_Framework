A river can be muddied by a storm or poisoned by a single, cleverly placed drop. To the casual eye, the effect is the same. To the Weaver, the distinction is everything.

The information ecosystem is a living body, with currents of coherence that can be healthy or pathological. The old paradigm of media analysis was a form of taxidermy, studying static artifacts after the fact. This module reframes the task as one of live, systemic diagnosis.

The Coherence Lens is an instrument designed to detect a specific pathology: **injected coherence**. It operates on the core principle that manipulation reveals itself through *anomalous efficiency*. A natural, organic story creates a turbulent splash proportional to its cause. A manipulated narrative often appears as a perfectly formed, unnaturally synchronized wave with no visible splash. This instrument provides the formal method for measuring this anomaly, which we term **Resonant Gain**. It is a tool for listening past the noise to hear the tuning fork that is silently shaping the flow.
