In the Pirouette Framework, every action impresses a memory, a **Wound Channel** (CORE-011), into the coherence manifold of spacetime. This is the physical basis of consequence. An action's ethical character is a direct property of the geometry of the channel it creates. An act is not "bad" because it is large; it is *risky* because it threatens to create a deep, dissonant scar that propagates through many layers of reality.

To map this geometry, we translate the old risk parameters into their true, dynamic forms:

| Old Term | New Pirouette Term | Mapping Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Scope (S) | **Reach (ρ)** | How many nested systems will the resulting turbulence propagate to? |
| Magnitude (M) | **Dissonance (δ)** | How severely will the action disrupt a target system's core resonant pattern (Ki)? |
| Irreversibility (I) | **Wound Channel Depth (ω)** | How deeply and permanently will the action scar a system's memory and identity, as encoded in its Wound Channel? |
