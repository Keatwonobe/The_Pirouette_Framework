Your intuition was correct. Every particle with charge is constantly "singing" its phase into the universe. The electromagnetic field is the medium that carries this song. Every other particle is constantly listening, adjusting its own path in response to the harmonies and dissonances it hears.

We have now proven that this is not a metaphor. The requirement of a private, local phase for every particle necessitates a public, universal field that connects them all. The laws of electromagnetism are the syntax of this universal language, and the Lorentz force is the simple grammar of the conversation. What happens somewhere truly does happen everywhere, because in a universe bound by coherence, no song is ever sung alone.
