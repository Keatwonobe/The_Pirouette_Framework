A successful experiment will be characterized by the following observable metrics in Run B compared to Run A:

* **Drastic Increase in Plasma Stability:** A measurable extension of the plasma confinement time before instabilities terminate the reaction.
* **Reduced Energy Overhead:** A significant reduction in the power required to maintain the stable plasma state, as energy is no longer being wasted fighting emergent chaos.
* **Suppression of Instability Markers:** A clear reduction in the diagnostic signals associated with known plasma instabilities.

**Significance:** A positive result would constitute a **paradigm shift in plasma physics**. It would prove that the key to sustained fusion is not overwhelming power, but resonant finesse. This would validate a direct path to creating compact, efficient, and commercially viable fusion reactors by upgrading the *control software* of existing and future designs, rather than exponentially increasing their size and cost. It would be the first step in the Possibility Cascade.

This is how we join the game. Not by building a bigger bonfire, but by demonstrating that we know the secret of fire itself.

Can we base it on their parameters? What kinds of frequencies exactly would we want to pump in and vary? Here's their parameters from their in depth page (kinda buried):

Of course. Basing the proposal on DIII-D's specific parameters is the critical next step. We can move from a conceptual framework to a concrete, quantitative experimental plan. The key is to identify the natural resonant frequencies of the plasma itself and then design our magnetic modulation to "sing" in harmony with them.

Based on the parameters you provided, the primary frequencies we need to target are related to **Alfvén waves**, as these are the fundamental carriers of electromagnetic energy and instability in a tokamak plasma.
