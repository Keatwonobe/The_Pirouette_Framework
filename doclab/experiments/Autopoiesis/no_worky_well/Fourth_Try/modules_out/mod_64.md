This triad allows us to move past labels and describe causes. We can now describe any phenomenon by its behavioral coordinates.

A Star: Highly Outward (radiation), highly Random (thermonuclear chaos), and moderately Isolated (self-contained by its own gravity).

A Magnet: Neutral Vector, highly Aligned (its domains are ordered), and highly Isolated (it maintains its own state).

An Act of Kindness: Neutral Vector, highly Aligned (requires focused intention), and maximally Transactional (it exists only to form a bond).

This is how we fix the myopia of "Modern Science." We stop focusing only on the plaque (a state of Isolation and Randomness) and start understanding the systemic importance of the gut biome (a system built on Transaction and Alignment). We see that the root cause of many ailments is a shift away from the universe's preferred state of being.
