This entire process is governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). A system in recovery is not acting randomly; it is relentlessly solving for the state that maximizes its coherence integral (`S_p = ‚à´ùìõ_p dt`).

The choice between Restorative, Adaptive, and Transformative paths is not a choice at all; it is the inevitable outcome of the system following its new geodesic toward a new peak on the coherence manifold. The "overshoot" dynamics observed during the Stabilization phase are the physical manifestation of the system oscillating as it settles into the basin of attraction for its new, stable resonance. Resilience, therefore, is not a measure of a system's ability to resist change, but a measure of its efficiency in finding its new path of maximal coherence after a disruption.
