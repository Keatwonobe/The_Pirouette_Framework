This model transforms serendipity from a passive hope into an active practice. A Weaver can cultivate it by:

1.  **Tuning the Antenna:** Deliberately increasing one's harmonic openness by exploring diverse fields, learning new skills, and engaging with unfamiliar perspectives. This enriches the Ki pattern, making it sensitive to more of the world's hidden songs.
2.  **Seeking the Signal:** Purposefully immersing oneself in "noisy signal" environments. This means breaking routines, traveling, and initiating conversations outside of one's usual domain to maximize exposure to latent patterns.
3.  **Lowering the Inertia of Self:** Practicing the intellectual and emotional flexibility required to endure the Coherence Shock and allow an Alchemical Union to occur. This is the willingness to be wrong, to abandon a cherished hypothesis, and to allow one's own Wound Channel to be reshaped by a new truth.
