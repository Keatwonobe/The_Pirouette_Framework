The discovery of a strong Resonant Concordance is a profound physical statement. According to the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), each system follows the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—on its local manifold.

When this instrument detects a shared resonance, it has found empirical evidence that these disparate systems are navigating the *same **macro-geodesic***. Subjected to a sufficiently powerful shared pressure, they have abandoned their individual paths for a new, collective path of least resistance. The threads are not just coincidentally similar; they are all flowing downhill along the same cosmic contour. This transforms the analysis from a descriptive tool into a predictive engine for the entire multi-domain system.
