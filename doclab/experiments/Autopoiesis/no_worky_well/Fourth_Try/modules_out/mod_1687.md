summary: Modernizes Reverse Pareto Analysis into a diagnostic instrument that identifies
  the critical few sources responsible for the majority of a system's coherence loss.
  This module provides a direct, actionable protocol for pinpointing the primary bottlenecks
  that disrupt a system's flow into turbulence or stagnation.
