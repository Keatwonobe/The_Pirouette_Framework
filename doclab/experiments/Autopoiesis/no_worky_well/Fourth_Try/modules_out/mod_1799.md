The Gyroid Loom is a computational pipeline that translates observational data into a full 3D model of the system's resonant Ki pattern.

| Step | Modern Function | Description & Method |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Observational Projection** | Translate 2D slices into angular projections. | Each 2D data slice (`magnetogram`, `micro-CT`, etc.) is transformed into a sinogram using a Radon-FFT method. This converts spatial information into a format that reveals the system's underlying rotational and radial symmetries. |
| **Temporal Coordinate Mapping** | Map projections onto a helical time-space. | The stack of sinograms is unwound onto helical coordinates. This crucial step reframes the spatial stack as a single, continuous, spiraling history, treating the `z-axis` as a proxy for the system's temporal evolution or resonant phase. |
| **Coherence Manifold Solver** | Solve for the most probable Ki geometry. | Using the mapped data as boundary conditions, the engine solves for the underlying coherence manifold (`ψ`). It iteratively fits a gyroidal solution by finding a stable state for the system's Lagrangian. This is the heart of the process: finding the geometry that best explains the sparse data as a path of maximal coherence. |
| **Ki Manifold Export** | Generate the 3D resonant geometry. | The final, solved coherence manifold (`ψ`) is exported as a 3D mesh (e.g., STL file via marching cubes) and a full 3D field map. This map allows for the direct calculation of derived properties like local coherence (`Kτ`) and temporal pressure (`Γ`). |
