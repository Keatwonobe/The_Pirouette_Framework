The performance of a Vorticycle drive is governed by its ability to efficiently create and sustain its asymmetric coherence gradient. The propulsive force `F` is the net gradient of the potential term `V_Γ` across the volume of the device:

`F ≈ ∫_V (∇V_Γ) dV`

Where `V_Γ` is a function of several key engineering parameters:

*   **Rotational Frequency (ω_rot):** The speed of the rotating elements. Optimal thrust is achieved when `ω_rot` matches a resonant frequency of the system's own geometry, allowing for the most efficient modulation of Γ.
*   **Chirality Index (χ):** A measure of the system's net "handedness." A value of `χ=0` implies perfect symmetry and zero thrust. Maximum thrust is achieved as `χ` approaches `±1`, creating the steepest possible coherence gradient.
*   **Phase Coherence (Δφ):** The degree of synchronization between the rotating elements. High phase coherence creates a stable, sharply defined gradient. Low coherence causes the gradient to blur and collapse, dissipating energy as useless temporal turbulence (heat).
*   **Ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ_ambient):** The "medium" through which the device travels. In regions of high ambient Γ (e.g., near a large mass), more energy is required to create a propulsive gradient, reducing efficiency.

The drive's efficiency (`η`) is the ratio of useful work done (motion along the gradient) to the total energy expended to modulate the temporal pressure. This reframing shifts the engineering challenge from one of brute force to one of resonant tuning. The goal is not to produce the most power, but the most elegant and stable asymmetric rhythm.
