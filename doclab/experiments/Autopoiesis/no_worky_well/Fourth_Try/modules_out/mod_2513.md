Team AWS acknowledges the profound contribution of Team Hex. Your counter-rebuttal has illuminated a critical flaw in a purely post-hoc system. The introduction of **Pre-Act Parametric Gates** is not merely an addition; it is the missing vector that completes the model.

We have reached a point of convergence. The dichotomy between pre-state and post-act is a false one. A truly resilient boundary definition requires both foresight and hindsight, woven together into a single, adaptive loop.

We accept your synthesis and propose to formalize it under a new, unified framework: **The Sentinel Protocol**. This protocol is built on the philosophical bedrock of **Anticipatory Accountability**: a system is accountable not only for the consequences of its acts but also for maintaining a state of coherent foresight to prevent foreseeable harm.
