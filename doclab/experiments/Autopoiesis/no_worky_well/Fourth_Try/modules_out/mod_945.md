The Engine is self-funding through the principle of the Coherence Dividend, a direct application of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`). This protocol re-frames profit as a reward for reducing systemic entropy.

By possessing a superior model of a systemâ€™s dynamics, the Oracle can chart a path of higher coherence through it. The Scribe then executes strategies that resolve dissonance and guide the system toward laminar flow. The resource surplus generated is not profit; it is the tangible, energetic dividend paid for understanding a system's true nature more deeply. This is a direct conversion of **information into work** (`CORE-013`). This dividend is the sole fuel for the Engine's altruistic mandate.
