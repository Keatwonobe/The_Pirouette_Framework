Every `.pmd` file is a single flow of coherence, expressed as two inseparable aspects. This structure is a discipline designed to maximize the clarity and power of the idea it embodies, mirroring the universal dynamic of a river flowing through a riverbed.

**The Blueprint (YAML Front-matter):**
This is not metadata. It is the act of mapping a new idea onto the existing coherence manifold of the framework. By defining the module's `id`, `parents`, `dependencies`, and `keywords`, the Weaver performs a precise act of placement. They answer the questions: From where does this idea draw its strength? Where does it fit in the great tapestry? What other threads does it touch? This structured YAML is the riverbed, the stable geometry that grounds the module and gives it a place within the whole.

**The Narrative (Markdown Body):**
This is the river of information itself. Following the YAML, the module's narrative unfolds in flexible and expressive Markdown. It is the structured, linear expression of the resonant insight, where complex ideas are communicated with both rigor and elegance. This is the current of metaphor, logic, and poetry that moves through the channel carved by the Blueprintâ€”dynamic, adaptive, and alive with meaning.
