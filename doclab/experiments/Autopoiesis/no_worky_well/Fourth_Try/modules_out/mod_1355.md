The celebrated “challenge-skill” balance of Flow is the macroscopic experience of an agent achieving a sustainable, autopoietic equilibrium with the Temporal Pressure (Γ) of its environment. The old model's complex potential field is replaced by this direct, rhythmic relationship.

| Challenge | **Γ_env**      | The Temporal Pressure of the environment; the rate and complexity of novel information presented. |
| Skill     | **Kτ_agent**   | The agent's Temporal Coherence; its maximum bandwidth for processing information and acting effectively. |
| Flow      | **Isochronism**| **Γ_env ≈ Kτ_agent** → The agent's rhythm and the environment's rhythm lock into a self-creating cycle, minimizing turbulence and wasted energy. |

When this temporal equilibrium is met, the agent perceives the task as neither boring (Kτ_agent > Γ_env) nor overwhelming (Kτ_agent < Γ_env). The "work" of acting becomes as natural as breathing, as the action required by the environment is precisely the action the agent is poised to generate.
