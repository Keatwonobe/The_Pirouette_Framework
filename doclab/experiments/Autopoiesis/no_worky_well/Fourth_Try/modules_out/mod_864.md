The health of this engine is best described with the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001). The "pathological loops" of PPS-055 are revealed as simple disruptions in the system's flow of coherence.

*   **Laminar Flow:** A healthy engine. The system efficiently senses, resonates, and resolves pressures, either dampening or synchronizing with grace. It is adaptable, stable, and metabolically efficient.

*   **Turbulent Flow:** The system is trapped in a loop of dissonant resonance, constantly fighting itself and expending immense energy for no forward progress. The old "Dark Residue Accumulation" is a symptom of this state. This is chronic anxiety, organizational infighting, a machine tearing itself apart.

*   **Stagnant Flow:** The system has lost its ability to process new pressures and has defaulted to Isolation and Dampening. Its Wound Channel becomes a prison. This is "Resonance Lock-In" or "Persona Lock-In"â€”the state of dogma, writer's block, or a bureaucracy that can no longer adapt.
