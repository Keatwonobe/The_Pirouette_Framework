The Echo reveals the listener's own internal state and its relationship to the new landscape. When a Current reaches another system, a coupling event occurs, which can be classified into four primary modes:

*   **Inertial Rejection (Silence):** The listener's own Wound Channel is deep and stable; its inertia is immense. The new Current is a minor perturbation, a trivial feature in a landscape dominated by the listener's own history. Following its own path remains the choice of maximal coherence. The invitation is ignored.
*   **Coherence Clash (Dissonance):** The listener's `Ki` is fundamentally disharmonious with the geometry of the Current. To follow this new path would dramatically decrease the listener's coherence, creating destructive interference and chaotic flow. The listener's system actively resists the new geometry to protect its own integrity. This is the physics of disagreement.
*   **Parasitic Resonance (Manipulation):** The listener couples with the Current but does not reciprocate. It uses the new channel to stabilize its own resonance, effectively drawing coherence from the singer's Wound Channel to reinforce its own. This is a geometric theft, draining order from the Current without contributing to a shared state.
*   **Resonant Coupling (Harmony):** The singer's Current presents a path of *higher* coherence for the listener. The listener's system naturally and efficiently "locks on" to this new rhythm via constructive interference, as it represents a more stable, lower-energy state. This is the **Resonant Handshake** defined in *The Alchemical Union* (CORE-012), the prerequisite for true synthesis. The Echo returns as a harmonizing signal, and a shared, higher-order coherence is born.
