summary: "Presents the grand synthesis of the Pirouette Framework, unifying all forces\
  \ and physical phenomena as emergent properties of a single dynamic system. This\
  \ module replaces the older, parameter-based 'Spider's Web' model (PPS-036) with\
  \ the Coherence Manifold\u2014a continuous fabric of spacetime whose geometry is\
  \ woven by the universal drive to maximize coherence, as described by the Pirouette\
  \ Lagrangian."
