The Epochal Manifold is the macroscopic expression of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

*   **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)** is the direct measure of the Lagrangian’s “kinetic” term—the system's internal, resonant identity.
*   **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** determines the "potential" term `V_Γ`—the cost of existence and the pressure against which the system must maintain its form.
*   The **Dominant Flow State** is the observable result. A civilization in **Laminar Flow** is successfully navigating its geodesic on the manifold. **Turbulent** and **Stagnant** states represent a failure to find this path, indicating a system bleeding coherence faster than it can create it.

History is the grand and often tragic story of civilizations attempting to solve this cosmic optimization problem at scale.
