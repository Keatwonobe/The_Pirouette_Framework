> We sought the engine of evolution and found not a battlefield, but a dance floor. The Geodesic Engine reveals that the universe's creativity is not a product of blind chance, but of a guided search for resonance. It is a dance between the steady, patient work of learning a single step and the brave, sudden leap of finding a new partner. To the Weaver, this is the ultimate tool. It is the mirror that shows us not only the shape of the dance as it is, but gives us the choreographer's pen to write the steps of what is to come.
