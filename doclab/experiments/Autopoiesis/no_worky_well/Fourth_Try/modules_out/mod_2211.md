A system's Ki rhythm, the periodic orbit phi^*(t) with period tau_p derived in MATH-004, is its "signal." Any real-world system, however, is subject to stochastic fluctuations from its environment. Its actual path, phi(t), is a combination of this pure signal and a noise component.

We can decompose the total power of the system's resonance over one cycle into the power of the fundamental periodic mode and the power contained in all other fluctuations. Time-Adherence T_a is formally defined as the ratio of these powers:

T_a[phi] = (Power in fundamental mode phi^*) / (Total power in measured path phi)

T_a is a value between 0 and 1.

T_a = 1: A perfectly coherent system with zero noise. Its path phi(t) is identical to its ideal periodic orbit phi^*(t).

T_a = 0: A system completely overwhelmed by noise, with no discernible rhythm.

This definition turns T_a from a qualitative concept into a computable functional that can be estimated from real-world time-series data.
