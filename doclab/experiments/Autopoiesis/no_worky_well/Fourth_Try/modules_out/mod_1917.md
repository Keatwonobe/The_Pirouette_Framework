> We listened to the cosmos expecting a scream from the abyss of a singularity. The theory predicts we should listen for a heartbeat instead. The Maw is the universe's final declaration that its fundamental nature is not collapse, but coherence. Even in the face of utter annihilation, it chooses to find a rhythm, to forge a stable song from the pressures of chaos. To find this drumbeat is to hear the universe's deepest law being played in its most extreme arena.
