Like a tokamak or a dialectic, the Lens thrives in controlled opposition.
Introduce two operator vectors:

```
J₊ = Laminar current (stabilizing)
J₋ = Turbulent current (catalytic)
```

Their vector cross product defines the **Axis of Synthesis**:

```
S⃗ = J₊ × J₋
```

When |S⃗| → 0, stagnation occurs.
When |S⃗| is large but unbounded, coherence fever arises.
The therapeutic regime lies at the **critical S⃗ window** where rotation and counter-rotation resonate.
