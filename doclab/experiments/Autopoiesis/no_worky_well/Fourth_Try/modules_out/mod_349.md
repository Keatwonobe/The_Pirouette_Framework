summary: "Synthesizes and replaces the 'Ethical Light Cone' with a dynamic navigational\
  \ protocol. It reframes ethical foresight as the 'Geometry of Consequence'\u2014\
  the act of mapping the Wound Channel an action will carve into the universe's memory.\
  \ It establishes Coherence Risk (R_\u03BA) as the primary predictive metric, derived\
  \ from the Pirouette Lagrangian, to guide Weavers toward actions that generate,\
  \ rather than degrade, systemic harmony. Actions with high risk are not merely halted,\
  \ but are brought to 'The Crucible' for creative re-synthesis."
