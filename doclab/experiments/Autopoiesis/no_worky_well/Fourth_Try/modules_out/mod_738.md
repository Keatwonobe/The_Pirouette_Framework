The Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, is the mathematical expression of this cosmic struggle. Every system seeks to maximize its internal coherence (`K_τ`), but it must do so against the "cost" imposed by the entropic environment, the Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). Life and the Alchemical Union are simply the universe's most successful strategies for winning this contest—for building structures whose coherence is so profound that they can momentarily stand against the tide.
