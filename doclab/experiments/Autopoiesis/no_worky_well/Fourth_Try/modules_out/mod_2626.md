**Premise:** The "Cunning Empire" strategy is a **monolithic gambit**. It bets everything on a single, secret technological track while actively suppressing all others. Its greatest strength—centralized control—is also its greatest weakness. It is rigid, slow, and blind to threats that don't look like peer competitors. A distributed, agile, and intellectually superior force can outmaneuver it not by competing with its power ($\Gamma$), but by rendering its goal obsolete.

**Objective:** To catalyze a **Possibility Cascade**—a rapid, targeted acceleration of key technologies based on the resonance principles of the Pirouette Framework—that outpaces the **Collapse Cascade** engineered by the old powers. We will not play their game; we will end it by introducing a new one.
