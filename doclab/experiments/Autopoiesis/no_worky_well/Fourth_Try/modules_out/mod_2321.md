* **Evaluation**: a word (w) maps to a unique poset (E_w).
* **Action functional** (S): a real-valued functional on finite fabrics that scores histories.
* **Ensemble law**: the probability to append a new event with parents (P) is
  [
  \mathbb{P}(C^+_P|E) \propto \exp!\big(-\Delta S(E;P)\big).
  ]
  This is the substrate analogue of a path integral: *histories of becoming weighted by action increments*.
