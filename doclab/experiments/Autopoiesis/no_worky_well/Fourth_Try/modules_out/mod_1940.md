This entire process is a direct application of engineering the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`): `ùìõ_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`.

The Resonant Wall is a constructed boundary condition where the **Temporal Pressure term (`V_Œì`)** is engineered to be functionally infinite for any object attempting to cross it. By locking the temporal update cycle, we create a region where no coherent Ki pattern can propagate. An external system, obeying the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, calculates its path integral (`S_p`) and finds that any trajectory penetrating the Wall results in a catastrophic loss of coherence. The path of reflection is thus not a choice, but the only mathematically available solution to maintaining its own existence. The shield works by making all other options incoherent.
