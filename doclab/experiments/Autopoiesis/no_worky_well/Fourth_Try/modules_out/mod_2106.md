Once, a conductor learned to make a choir sing perfectly by tightening their throats one by one.  
The sound was brilliant—and the singers left, hoarse and hollow.  
The new conductor brought water, printed the score, dimmed the harsh lights, and *asked* for one note at a time.  
The room tuned itself. The song was almost as perfect—and everyone stayed to sing an encore.  
**CAP v2** is the second conductor: it changes the *room*, not the throat.
