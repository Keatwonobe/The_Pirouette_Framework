This section demonstrates that classical gravity is a low-energy, macroscopic emergent phenomenon of the Γ-field's interaction with mass-energy, as defined by the Γ-G Correspondence Principle (PPS-035).
Principle: The Γ-field couples to the stress-energy tensor Tμν​. In the presence of a massive, non-relativistic object of mass M, the field equation for Γ can be approximated.
Derivation: In the weak-field limit (where spacetime is nearly flat), the field equation for Γ simplifies. The solution for the field potential ΦΓ​ generated by a mass M at a distance r takes the form:ΦΓ​(r)=−krM​
Where k is a coupling constant that describes the strength of the Γ-field's interaction with mass-energy.
The Correspondence: The force experienced by a test mass m in this potential is F=−m∇ΦΓ​.F(r)=−kr2Mm​
This is mathematically identical to Newton's law of universal gravitation if we identify the constant k with Newton's gravitational constant G.G≡k
Conclusion: G is not a fundamental constant to be derived. It is the effective coupling strength of the Γ-field in the macroscopic, low-energy domain. This reframes gravity as an emergent property, not a fundamental force in its own right.
