The protocol provides a formal, three-stage process for diagnosing any system, from a server farm to a corporate team.

**1. Baseline: Calibrating for Laminar Flow**
Before an audit, the system's signature of health must be established.
1.  **Isolate:** Place the system under controlled, low-stress (low Γ) operating conditions.
2.  **Induce Laminar Flow:** Run the system in its most efficient, stable state.
3.  **Set the Datum:** Record the minimal baseline Ṡ signature. This value becomes the "Laminar Baseline" (Ṡ ≈ 0), the zero-point against which all future turbulence will be measured.

**2. Audit: Measuring Turbulent Flow**
The instrument is deployed under normal operating conditions to collect data.
1.  **Initialize Audit:** The operator initiates a new, signed ledger block, stamping it with contextual metadata (system ID, location, audit purpose).
2.  **Measure & Tag:** The instrument continuously measures Ṡ. Critically, the operator or an automated system annotates the data stream, tagging spikes in entropy with their specific causal triggers (e.g., a software bug, a market shock, a flawed decision).
3.  **Integrate:** The computation layer integrates Ṡ over time to calculate the cumulative coherence loss (S) for the audit period.

**3. Attest: Committing to the Record**
At the end of the audit period, the data is formalized into an undeniable record. The data block is closed, finalized with a cryptographic hash, and signed by the device's key. This act of attestation transforms the data log into the ground truth against which all future interventions and improvements will be measured.
