Instead of the previous framework's complex vectors, we now characterize each mode with a few clear, physically grounded parameters derived from the Coherence Manifold. A crucial distinction is made between a state's instantaneous quality and its historical, ingrained stability.

| Parameter | Description | Replaces |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Modal Ki (Ki_m)** | The specific geometric pattern of resonance that defines the mode. It is the "musical score" for that state. | `Phase-Lock Configuration` |
| **Coherence Height (𝓛_p,m)** | The absolute value of the Pirouette Lagrangian at the mode's peak. This measures the instantaneous quality, efficiency, and purity of the state's resonance. | `Ta` |
| **Stability Depth (Δ𝓛_p)** | The height of the mode's peak relative to the lowest surrounding transition saddle. It is a direct measure of the mode's resistance to perturbation. A deeper basin requires more disruption to exit. | `Inter-Modal Barrier Height`, `Γ Confinement` |
| **Wound Channel Inertia** | Persistence in a mode carves a **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) into the manifold, geometrically deepening its basin over time. This increases the `Stability Depth`, making the state a "habit" that is gravitationally harder to leave. It is the memory of the state. | `N/A` |
