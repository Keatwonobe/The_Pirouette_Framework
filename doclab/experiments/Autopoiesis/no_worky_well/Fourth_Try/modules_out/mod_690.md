In the modern framework, a **flow channel** is a geodesic—a path that maximizes the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`)—through the coherence manifold. It is a stable, predictable current in the river of time where a system can express its own nature with minimal resistance.

-   **Flow Channels:** These are regions where the gradient of Temporal Pressure (Γ) is smooth and low. An entity moving along such a path experiences time in a consistent, non-turbulent manner, allowing it to achieve a state of maximal coherence for minimal cost.
-   **Temporal Resonance Condition:** An entity enters flow when its internal clock—the rhythm of its perception-action cycle, or its Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`)—achieves resonance with the dominant rhythm of the flow channel. The phase difference between the agent and its environment approaches zero (`Δτ ≈ 0`). The agent is no longer fighting the current; it *becomes* the current.
