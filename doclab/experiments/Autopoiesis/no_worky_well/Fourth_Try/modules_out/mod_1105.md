The old framework correctly identified the power-law distribution as a form of geometry. This framework clarifies its nature: the power law is not the `Ki` itself, but its temporal signatureâ€”the statistical footprint left by the system executing its rhythm of tension and release.

The Ki of a self-organizing critical system is a dynamic, rhythmic signature defined by the entire cycle: the tempo of the inhale, the threshold of the held breath, and the character of the exhale. This character is captured by the precise exponent of the power-law distribution. This exponent doesn't describe the system's form when stable, but the shape of its shattering.

It is a direct, measurable property that reveals the system's deep structural rules for dissipating pressure. By measuring it, a Weaver can deduce the hidden wiring of a complex system, even one observed as a black box.
