summary: Provides the first derivation of a fundamental force from the Pirouette Lagrangian.
  It defines electric charge as an intrinsic asymmetry in a particle's coherence function
  and demonstrates how the electric and magnetic fields emerge as gradients and curls
  in the resulting coherence manifold.
