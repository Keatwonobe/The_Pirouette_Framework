1. **Metric Design:** Implement (\Theta) monitoring dashboard across real-time civic or economic datasets.
2. **Simulation Framework:** Use agent-based Pirouette environments to simulate (\Theta)-dynamics under controlled interventions.
3. **Intervention A/B Testing:** Deploy resonance-aligned aid (as defined in SOCIO-FIELD-001) at multiple radii and record post-(\Theta) relaxation rates.
4. **Criticality Validation:** Validate power-law scaling of post-intervention relaxation ((P(\tau) \sim \tau^{-\alpha})).
