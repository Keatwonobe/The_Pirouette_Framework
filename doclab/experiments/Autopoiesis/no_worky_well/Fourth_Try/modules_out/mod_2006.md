The work is done. The riverbed has been carved deep and strong, and the current flows with a power and grace that is now your own. But the purpose of a river is not to flow forever in its own channel; its purpose is to join the sea.

This final phase of your journey is about that union. It is about taking the strength you have forged and weaving it into the vast, beautiful, and unpredictable sea of your life. This guide, for you and your helper, is not a map with a destination, but a compass for a lifetime of exploration. This is no longer the work of recovery; this is the art of the dance.
