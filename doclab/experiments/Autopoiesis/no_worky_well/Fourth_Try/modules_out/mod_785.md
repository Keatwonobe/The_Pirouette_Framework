The rate of entropy production, or Coherence Cost, is a function of both the environment and the system's internal state. We express this with a single, fundamental relationship.

The rate of local entropy production (`Ṡ_local`) is directly proportional to the ambient Temporal Pressure and the degree of the system's own internal turbulence.

`Ṡ_local ∝ Γ ⋅ T_idx`

Where:
*   **`Γ`** is the local **Temporal Pressure**, the ambient chaotic energy of the environment that a system must navigate.
*   **`T_idx`** is the **Turbulence Index**, a dimensionless measure (0 to 1) of the system's internal dissonance. It quantifies how much a system's Ki pattern is deviating from a pure, laminar state. `T_idx = 0` for perfect Laminar Flow; `T_idx = 1` for pure chaos.

The cumulative **Entropy Ledger** (`S_ledger`) is the integral of this rate over time. It is the running tally of the system's temporal debt—the total amount of order it has converted into noise. For practical field applications, `Ṡ_local` can often be approximated by measuring **Frictional Loss (Φ_f)**, where `Φ_f = (Total Energy Expended) - (Coherent Work Performed)`.
