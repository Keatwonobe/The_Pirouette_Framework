Every significant social group, or Faction, is defined by its Faction Directive. This is a short, clear statement of the faction's core values, goals, and methods. It is the faction's soul, its own Prime Directive, and it is the standard against which all actions are measured.

GM's Tool: The Faction Directive is the GM's primary tool for roleplaying a faction consistently. It is the lens through which the faction sees the world.

Example Faction Directives:

The Archivist's Guild: "Knowledge must be preserved and protected from chaos, at any cost."

The Gilded Hand (Merchant's Guild): "Coherence is capital. A deal is a sacred text. Profit is the measure of a sound will."

The Order of the Unbroken Wall (Knights): "We are the shield. We hold the line. We protect the weak from the coming storm."

The Whisper-Thieves: "Secrets are the only true currency. Every lock has a key, and we are the locksmiths."
