This module provides a formal protocol for navigating this reverse journey, transforming a design goal into a practical recipe.

**1. Define the Well (The Destination):**
The process begins by defining the target state not by its components, but by its resonance. The user specifies its stable `Ki` pattern (its geometric and energetic signature) and the depth of its coherence well (a measure of its stability or binding energy). This fixes the destination on the coherence manifold.

**2. Trace the Geodesic Upstream (The Path):**
The core algorithm performs the retrosynthetic trace. Starting from the defined well, it moves backward along the manifold, seeking paths of maximal *decrease* in coherence. This computationally intensive step identifies and maps the Precursor Basin, revealing the full landscape of viable starting materials and environmental conditions.

**3. Map the Alchemical Union (The Recipe):**
For the most probable precursors in the basin, the module then maps the forward journey. It models the **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) required to form the target. This step calculates the necessary environmental conditions—the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) that acts as a catalyst or containment—and the harmonic and phase alignments required for the precursors to engage in a **Resonant Handshake**.

**4. Calculate Feasibility (The Cost):**
Finally, each potential pathway is ranked by its **Coherence Cost**. This is not a vague measure of energy, but a precise calculation derived from the Lagrangian (see §4). It represents the integral of the action required to form the target. As per CORE-013, paths with the lowest Coherence Cost represent the most efficient and probable routes of synthesis. This cost is evaluated through two primary heuristics:
*   **Coherence Gradient (ΔKτ):** The "steepness" of the path. A gentle slope represents an easy, low-energy synthesis, while a steep cliff represents a high-entropy transition requiring significant catalytic intervention.
*   **Path Complexity:** The length and tortuosity of the geodesic. Short, direct paths are more probable than long, winding ones.
