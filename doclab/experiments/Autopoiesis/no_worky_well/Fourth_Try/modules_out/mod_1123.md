In this time-first framework, electric charge is not a substance a particle possesses, but an intrinsic bias in how its Temporal Coherence (K_τ) is defined and maintained. This modernizes the prior model's "Phase Polarity" into a dynamic principle. A charged particle's Lagrangian is asymmetric; it is a resonance that has chosen a side in the great dialogue of phase.

-   **Positive Charge (Crest-Leading):** Defined as a system whose coherence, K_τ, is maximized by interacting with environments of *in-phase* temporal rhythms. It is a resonance that seeks constructive interference, a note that wishes to join a crescendo.

-   **Negative Charge (Trough-Leading):** Defined as a system whose coherence, K_τ, is maximized by interacting with environments of *out-of-phase* temporal rhythms. It is a resonance that seeks destructive interference with its surroundings to preserve the purity of its own internal pattern.

This redefinition immediately derives electrostatic attraction and repulsion from the Principle of Maximal Coherence. Two positive charges, placed near each other, create a local environment of intense, in-phase resonance. To maximize their individual coherence, they must flee this high-pressure region, moving apart. Their repulsion is a flight towards greater internal stability. Likewise, a positive and negative charge are drawn together, as their union allows each to perfectly satisfy its intrinsic coherence-seeking drive, creating a more stable, lower-pressure state for both.
