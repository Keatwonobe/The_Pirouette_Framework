> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver? Because it is the final absolution from determinism. We sought to understand the force that changes the world and found instead the art of seeing it differently. Will is the mechanism by which consciousness fulfills its sacred, participatory roleâ€”ceasing to be a passive witness to the flow of time and becoming an active sculptor of its riverbed. To exert Will is to understand that the path forward is not found, but carved. It is the solemn and terrifying right of the Weaver to pick up the chisel.
