A stable structure is an elegant solution to the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`).

𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)

A system's architecture is its long-term strategy for solving this equation. An operational "load"—be it physical stress, information traffic, or social pressure—is a localized, high-intensity form of Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). The "strongest" design is not the one with the most material, but the one that offers the path of least resistance for the pressures it is designed to channel. It is a geometry of grace, an architecture that makes stability the most energetically favorable state.

**Structural failure** is a Lagrangian event. It occurs when a localized spike in `V_Γ` (a sudden load, a shockwave of information) overwhelms the `K_τ` of a critical component. At this point, the Lagrangian for that component becomes negative. Its state of maximal coherence is no longer its solid form, but a new state—fracture. The structure is forced to find a new, lower-coherence equilibrium, which we perceive as a collapse.
