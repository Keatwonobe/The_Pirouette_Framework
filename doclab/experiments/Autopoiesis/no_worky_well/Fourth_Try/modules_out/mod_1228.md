A Coherence Well is the geometric consequence of a thought that has achieved a critical mass of resonance. It is a localized expression of the **Gladiator Force (CORE-008)**‚Äîthe fundamental drive toward building arenas of interaction‚Äîin the cognitive domain. Its properties are temporal and dynamic, replacing the old spatial proxies:

*   **Resonant Depth (KœÑ_well):** This replaces `Conceptual Mass`. It is a direct measure of a belief's temporal coherence‚Äîa function of its internal logical consistency, its explanatory power, and the sheer volume of its historical echoes. An idea reinforced by institutions, texts, and generations of minds possesses immense Resonant Depth, creating a stable, high-information pattern that resists erosion. It is the depth of the riverbed.

*   **Coherence Gradient (‚àáùìõ_p):** This replaces `Gravitational Strength`. It is the "steepness" of the slope leading into the well, a direct feature of the coherence manifold. A belief with a steep gradient is highly influential, presenting itself as the most logical or satisfying path for nearby thoughts. This is the allure of the song, the pull of the current.
