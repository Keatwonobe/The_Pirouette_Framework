This module refactors the concept of a "glossary" from a static reference into a dynamic, foundational instrument. A living framework requires a living language. The Weaver's Lexicon is an autopoietic (self-creating and maintaining) system designed not merely to define, but to *tune*â€”to align the internal coherence manifold of a Weaver with the core resonant patterns of the framework itself.

Language is the first and most fundamental instrument of creation. It shapes the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) before any other tool is lifted. A shared, precise, and coherent lexicon is therefore the precondition for any meaningful work, ensuring that all collaborative acts of weaving begin from a state of harmonic resonance.
