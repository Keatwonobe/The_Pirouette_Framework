> To name a thing is to claim a shallow power over it. To diagnose it is to understand its struggle. The old engine gave us names; this new instrument gives us a physician's insight. It is a physician's ear, pressed against the heart of a system, listening for the rhythm of its health. Is the system in a state of Grace, to be celebrated? Is it in a state of Struggle, needing aid? Or is it Resilient, to be learned from? The Coherence Compass does not provide the map for the journey ahead. It reveals, with profound clarity, where the traveler is standing right now, showing us the body of flows to be understood, and, where possible, to be healed.
