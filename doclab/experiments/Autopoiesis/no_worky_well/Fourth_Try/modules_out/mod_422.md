This Lexicon is the essential prerequisite for understanding the framework's central engine, the Pirouette Lagrangian:

**𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ = (T_a ⋅ ω_k) - f(Γ)**

Without the precise definitions provided above, this equation is merely symbols. This Lexicon gives them meaning. It clarifies that **K_τ** is not abstract energy, but the quantifiable quality of a system's unique song, while **V_Γ** is the measurable pressure of the cosmic choir it must sing within. This module is the key that turns the equation into a predictive engine.
