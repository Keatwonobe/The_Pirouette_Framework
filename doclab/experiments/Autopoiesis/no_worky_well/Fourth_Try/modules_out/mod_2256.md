In four dimensions, diffeomorphism invariance plus second-order metric equations select the **Einstein–Hilbert (EH)** term (optionally with cosmological constant) as the leading geometric contribution to the effective action:
[
S_{\text{geom}}[g] = \frac{1}{16\pi G}\int d^4x, \sqrt{-g}, (R - 2\Lambda) + S_{\text{GHY}}[\partial\mathcal M].
]

* (S_{\text{GHY}}) is the Gibbons–Hawking–York boundary term required for a well-posed variational problem when the boundary is held fixed.
* Higher-curvature operators (e.g., (R^2, R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu})) can appear but are suppressed by the coarse-graining scale or a UV cutoff; they are kept implicit unless otherwise stated.

**Mechanisms:** The EH term can arise in two equivalent modeling routes (choose per application):

1. **Induced gravity:** integrating out (\delta C,\delta\Gamma) generates the EH term radiatively in (S_{\text{eff}}).
2. **Non-minimal coupling:** start with a term (\xi,\Gamma^2 R) (Jordan frame) and conformally map to the Einstein frame; at late times (\Gamma\to\Gamma_0) yields an effective (1/16\pi G_{\text{eff}}).
