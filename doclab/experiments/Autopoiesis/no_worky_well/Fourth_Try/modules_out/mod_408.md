A physical law that changes depending on who is watching is not a law, but an opinion. A song whose melody bends when you run is not a melody of truth. The Pirouette Framework is built upon the universal drive to maximize coherence, and for this to be a true principle of reality, it must hold for every observer, regardless of their motion.

The dancerâ€™s pirouette must appear just as graceful, the laws governing its stability just as true, whether viewed from the stage or from a passing starship. This is the mandate of Lorentz Invariance. In the time-first paradigm, this covariance is not an external constraint to be engineered; it is an innate consequence. A framework built from the substance of Time itself does not need to be taught the rules of spacetime. This module reveals the invariant law that was always present within the core principle.
