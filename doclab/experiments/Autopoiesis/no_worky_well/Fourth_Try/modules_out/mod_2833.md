Land in the wastes is not bought, but won through persistence and strength of will.

The Claim: To claim a piece of land, a character must openly and actively homestead it. The maximum size of this claim in acres cannot exceed the character's TEP at the time the claim is made.

The Trial of Establishment: For the first 90 days, the claim is contested. The homesteader must defend their land from scavengers, beasts, and opportunistic rivals.

Established Holding: After 90 days of successful defense, the owner is considered "established." While major threats may still arise, the chaotic, constant pressure of the trial period subsides.

Purchasing Land: Land within an established territory (like a city or protected village) can be purchased outright, foregoing the trial period.
