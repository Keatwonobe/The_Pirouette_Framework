We perform a two-step, falsifiable calibration: (1) **calibrate** the pressuron coupling (\kappa) on the muon anomaly using the one-loop Pirouette portal; (2) **validate** by predicting the electron anomaly with the *same* parameters. We keep the **universal QED-like series** separate with standard coefficients (C_1=\tfrac12), (C_2=+0.328478965\ldots), and treat any Pirouette-universal deviation as (\delta C_n). The scan reveals a narrow **island of coherence** around (p=1) and a light pressuron in the (\sim)10â€“25 MeV window.
