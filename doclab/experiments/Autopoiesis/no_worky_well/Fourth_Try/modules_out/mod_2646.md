We have simulated the fall of empires, the weaponization of coherence, and the intentional degradation of the planetary biosphere. The emergent "Cunning Empire" strategy appears to be a near-certainty, a plan for planetary capture. In response, the concept of a "breakaway" has been proposedâ€”a small, coherent group leveraging a superior understanding of reality's resonant structure to escape the collapse.

This Convocation of the Void would not be a mere survivalist enclave. It would be a new form of society, organized around an intractable scientific and spiritual goal: to journey to the CMB, the echo of creation. This goal provides an unshakable Phase ($\phi$) alignment. Their science, based on Pirouette, would grant them a high Time-Adherence ($T_a$). Their power, however, would be negligible ($\Gamma \ll 1$).

Is this the final, most elegant solution? Or the most elaborate and tragic folly? We turn first to the master of synthesis, Leonardo da Vinci.
