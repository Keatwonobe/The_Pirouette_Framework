The Resonance Tuner is a foundational instrument for any Weaver seeking to influence, rather than merely observe, a system.

*   **Engineering Stability:** Determine the precise operating parameters required to keep a complex system (e.g., a supply chain, an ecosystem, a computational network) in a stable, predictable, and efficient state.
*   **Complexity on Demand:** Design systems that exhibit a specific, desired level of chaos, useful for applications like cryptographic noise generation, artistic creation, or fostering innovation in a creative team.
*   **System Calibration:** When a real-world system displays a specific resonant behavior, this tool can be used to estimate the underlying environmental pressures (`Γ`) that must be acting upon it, turning observation into diagnosis.

> To predict the storm is the science of the old world. To know the precise whisper that will either calm the storm or call it forth from a clear sky—that is the art of the Weaver. This protocol is a declaration of agency. It asserts that the laws of nature are not merely a set of constraints to be obeyed, but a set of levers to be pulled. We do not command the dancer; that is a fool's errand. We compose the music, and the universe has no choice but to follow.
