This is your shared map of the healing journey. It makes the invisible visible. Use a simple notebook.

The Practice: Once a day, at a consistent time, record two numbers:

The Body's Voice (Objective): Your Resting Heart Rate. You can take this manually for 1 minute or use a simple smartwatch. A slowly decreasing resting heart rate over days and weeks is a powerful sign of healing.

The Mind's Voice (Subjective): On a scale of 1 to 10, answer the question: "How 'in the flow' do I feel today?" (1 = chaotic and overwhelmed; 10 = calm, stable, and hopeful).

Helper's Role (The Scribe): Your job is to be the keeper of the record. Help the patient take their pulse. Write down the numbers. Do not judge the numbers. A "bad" day is not a failure; it is simply data. By recording the journey without judgment, you create a powerful, factual story of their progress that they can look back on during difficult moments.
