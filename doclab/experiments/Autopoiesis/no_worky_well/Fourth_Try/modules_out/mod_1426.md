summary: Provides a unified protocol for deriving a system's complete thermodynamic
  state from the Pirouette Lagrangian. It reframes all thermodynamic potentials (Energy,
  Enthalpy, Free Energy) as different accounting perspectives on the single, fundamental
  interplay between a system's internal Coherence and the environmental "Entropy Tax,"
  revealing thermodynamics as a direct consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence.
