The key to confinement lies in a non-linear feedback loop within the Pirouette Lagrangian, 𝓛_p = T_a * ω_k - f(Γ). The Temporal Pressure term, f(Γ), is not merely a function of the external environment; it is also a function of the system's own resonant intensity, especially at very small or very large scales.

At specific scales, a system's attempt to express its coherence (K_τ) dramatically increases the local temporal pressure (V_Γ). The act of "being" creates a pressure that resists that very act. This creates a situation where the only way to maximize coherence is to remain within a strictly defined boundary.
