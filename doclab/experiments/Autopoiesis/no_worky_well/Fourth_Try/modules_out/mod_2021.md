* **“Yes, it speaks your language.”** The module explicitly carries over your metrics (VO₂, 6MWD, ECG, ejection fraction) and retains them as anchors, not amusing analogies.
* **Phasing is conservative by design.** Even though Pirouette allows early progression, it never violates known safety thresholds (e.g. moderate RPE, non-isometric loads).
* **Therapeutic flexibility.** The modifiers (addiction, immunosuppression, mental health) help clinicians see how to adjust standard CR rules in complex patients.
* **Outcomes-alignment.** The framework encourages outcome measurement (pre/post echo, functional capacity) as feedback loops, not mystical guesswork.
* **Integration strategy.** Propose Pilots: e.g. enroll 5 valve patients in Pirouette-augmented CR, measure coherence metrics + standard outcomes, compare to conventional peers.
