* **Fifth-force limits:** a light pressuron mediates a new scalar interaction; laboratory/astrophysical bounds constrain (g) and (m_\Gamma).
* **Cosmology:** homogeneous (\Gamma) acts like a dark-energy/early-acceleration agent depending on (V); fluctuations contribute isocurvature/modified-sound-speed signals.
* **Coherence experiments (XXP):** map loop corrections to observables (line-shapes, g-2â€“like anomalies) once portals are specified.
