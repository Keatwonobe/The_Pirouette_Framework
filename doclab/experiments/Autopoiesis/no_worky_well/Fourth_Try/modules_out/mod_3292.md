* Treat each text as an **Entity** with “mass” ∝ μ.
* The quiver map of ∇V on the 64 × 64 grid shows *Hammurabi* generating the steepest potential well; *Walden* is nearly flat.
* Because we track only (μ, σ), the attractor manifold is literally 2-D – we have **no Ki‐like orthogonal axis yet**; dynamic drift over flip-count behaves like a *pseudo-time* coordinate but isn’t encoded in the state-vector.
