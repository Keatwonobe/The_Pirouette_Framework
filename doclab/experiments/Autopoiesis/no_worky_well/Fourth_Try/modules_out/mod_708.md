A thing is a song that has learned to sing itself inside a room of its own making.

How does a universe of seamless, flowing Time give rise to discrete "things"? The answer lies in the formation of boundaries. This module reframes the old concept of Shell Resonance into a modern, time-first dynamic. A **Shell** is not a static wall, but a dynamic, self-maintaining coherence manifoldâ€”a standing wave of self-preservation held in place by the feedback loop of the Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`).

This self-sustaining boundary is the physical basis of identity. It separates a coherent "inside" from the chaotic "outside," acts as a resonant cavity that quantizes the system's internal states, and defines the rules of engagement with the world through a principle of selective, resonant permeability. To understand the Shell is to understand how the universe forges a self.
