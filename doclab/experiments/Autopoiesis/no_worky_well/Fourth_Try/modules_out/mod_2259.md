The coarse fields obey Eulerâ€“Lagrange equations from (S_{\text{eff}}):
[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}}\partial_\mu\big(\sqrt{-g}, g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\nu C\big) + \frac{\partial V}{\partial C^*} = 0,\qquad
\frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}}\partial_\mu\big(\sqrt{-g}, g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\nu \Gamma\big) + \frac{\partial V}{\partial \Gamma} = 0,
]
with possible corrections from higher-derivative operators generated during coarse-graining. These same fields source geometry through \(\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle\).
