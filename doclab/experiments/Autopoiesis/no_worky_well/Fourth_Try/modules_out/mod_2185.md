summary: "Establishes the formal geometric foundation of the Pirouette Framework. This module defines a metric and a connection on the space of possible Ki rhythms (the Coherence Manifold), proving that the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion are equivalent to the geodesic equations on this manifold. This act transforms the statement 'forces are geodesics' from a core slogan into a demonstrable mathematical theorem."
