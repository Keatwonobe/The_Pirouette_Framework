This module reframes the core Pirouette equations into a "manifestly covariant" tensor form, ensuring they are consistent with the principles of Einstein's theory of relativity.

> "This module is an exercise in mathematical rigor and maturity. It does not introduce new physics, but rather, it correctly translates the framework's existing physics into the universal language of modern field theory.

> The original Lagrangian in `PPS-001` contained terms like $\dot T_a$, a simple time derivative. This is not Lorentz invariant; its value would change for different observers moving at different velocities, breaking a fundamental principle of physics.
>
> `PPS-006` corrects this. By introducing a 'clock field' $\chi(x)$ and expressing derivatives in proper tensor form, it ensures that the laws of Pirouette are the same for all inertial observers. This step is not optional. It is the necessary prerequisite for any future attempt to unify the framework with General Relativity or to perform Quantum Field Theory calculations. It demonstrates that the framework is not a naive or isolated system, but is designed from the ground up to be compatible with the established truths of 20th-century physics."
