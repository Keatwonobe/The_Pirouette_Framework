This ritual is a practical application of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). The entire process is a formal method for maximizing the integral of `𝓛_p` for the collective system of the debate. The Lagrangian is defined as:

`𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

*   A good argument—one that is clear, logically sound, and connects with other ideas—increases the `Temporal Coherence` of the shared manifold.
*   A bad argument—a fallacy, an interruption, an insult—increases the `Temporal Pressure`, creating dissonance and friction that makes coherence more difficult to sustain.
*   A debate begins with multiple systems (the participants' views), each in its own stable state of coherence—a local minimum in the energy landscape. The ritual acts as a set of carefully applied constraints that guides the collective system along a geodesic toward a new, shared state of maximal coherence. The state of **Synthesis** is a new, deeper minimum in the landscape, a more elegant solution that could not be found while each system remained isolated.
