Armor and shields do not have a health pool. Instead, they provide a chance to negate incoming damage through their inherent quality and the wielder's skill.

Armor: When you are hit by an attack, you may roll your armor's protection die. The result is subtracted from the incoming attack's damage as a form of entropic buffering.

Light Armor (Leather, Studded): 1d2 - 1d4

Medium Armor (Scale, Chain): 1d4 - 1d6

Heavy Armor (Plate): 1d6 - 1d8

Masterwork & Magical: 1d10+

Shields: A shield is an active defense tool. When you are targeted by an attack, you can use your reaction to either:

Block: Roll the shield's protection die and subtract the result from the incoming damage.

Deflect: Roll the shield's protection die and subtract the result from the attacker's to-hit roll.

Shield Quality: Bucklers (1 EP block), Wooden Shields (1d2), Steel Shields (1d3+).
