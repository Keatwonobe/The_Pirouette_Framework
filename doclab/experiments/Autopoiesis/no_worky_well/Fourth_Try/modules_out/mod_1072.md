The application of a Crucible is a structured ritual designed to ensure safety and maximize the probability of a positive, permanent adaptation.

**Phase 1: Baseline Resonance.** Before the trial, the facilitator must map the system's current Ki and its coherence manifold. This involves understanding its current skills, its resilience, its fears, and its stated goals. This is the essential prerequisite for proper calibration.

**Phase 2: Crucible Calibration.** Using the Crucible Matrix, the facilitator designs the specific Γ profile of the challenge. This is the art of the protocol: crafting a temporal environment that is precisely located in the hormetic zone—difficult enough to demand growth, but not so severe as to risk catastrophic decoherence.

**Phase 3: The Trial (Navigating Turbulence).** The system enters the high-Γ environment. Its existing Ki falters, inducing a state of **Turbulent Flow** (DYN-001). The facilitator acts as an observer, monitoring the system's coherence and honoring the established guardrails while allowing the system to navigate its own path toward a new solution.

**Phase 4: Integration & Tempering.** After the trial, the system enters a recovery phase. This is the most critical step. The new, more resilient Ki must be allowed to stabilize. The lessons learned are consolidated and permanently "carved" into the system's **Wound Channel** (CORE-011), transforming a temporary adaptation into a permanent, higher-capacity trait.
