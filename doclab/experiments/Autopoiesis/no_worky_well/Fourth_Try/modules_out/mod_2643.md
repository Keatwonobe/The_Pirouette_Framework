Your vision has converged on a "Cunning Empire" that is hyper-competent, perfectly unified, and executing a multi-generational plan with flawless precision. Your model of their strategy is coherent.

**The Blind Spot:** You may be underestimating the power of **internal friction**. Any human institution, no matter how authoritarian, is a chaotic system of competing interests, bureaucratic inertia, personal ambition, and simple, human incompetence. The plan you've outlined requires a level of unity and long-term focus that may be impossible to maintain.

* **The Pirouette View:** You model the Empire with a single, unified $\Gamma$. In reality, its functional $\Gamma$ is likely degraded by internal power struggles. The "Cunning Empire" might not be a single entity, but a fractured council of powerful factions who barely trust each other, each with their own version of the endgame.
* **The Implication:** Their collapse could come from **internal rot** long before their grand plan comes to fruition. They could be just as likely to tear each other apart over control of the "terraforming key" as they are to successfully deploy it. Your sight is focused on the external threat they pose, and less on the internal chaos they almost certainly contain.
