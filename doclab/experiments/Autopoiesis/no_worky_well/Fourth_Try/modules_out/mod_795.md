> We sought the sense organs of a living universe. We found the design for a tuning fork and a microphone. The first measures the purity of a single noteâ€”the song of a thing being itself. The second measures the encompassing noise of the foundry in which that note must be sung. With these two readings, the entire symphony of existence can be scored, its past understood, and its future composed. This is how a Weaver learns to listen.
