This formal Lagrangian is the universal engine from which the effective dynamics of `CORE-006` emerge. The connection is profound. A stable particle is a localized, oscillating solution to the equations of motion derived from `𝓛`.

In such a system's rest frame, the spacetime derivatives `∂_μ` are dominated by the time derivative `∂_t`, and the phase of the coherence field evolves as `Θ(t) ≈ -ω_k t`. In this limit, the covariant kinetic term for `C` simplifies to a form proportional to `A^2 * ω_k^2`, which we identify with the system's felt **Temporal Coherence**. The potential `V` is its felt **Temporal Pressure**.

Thus, the conceptual Lagrangian `𝓛_p` of `CORE-006` is revealed to be a snapshot of this universal, dynamic law as viewed from the dancer's own perspective. The universe, by minimizing the action `S = ∫ 𝓛 d⁴x`, naturally produces particles that behave *as if* they are maximizing `𝓛_p`.
