summary: Establishes a formal protocol for constructive discourse, re-framing debate
  not as combat, but as a collaborative ritual for achieving a 'Resonant Synthesis'
  (a higher-order shared understanding). It applies Flow Dynamics to diagnose the
  health of discourse and provides a structured process for transforming conflict
  into creation.
