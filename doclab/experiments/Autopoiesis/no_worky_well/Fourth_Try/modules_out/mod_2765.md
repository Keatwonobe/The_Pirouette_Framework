An entity's will, their Entropy, is a force of direct and predictable power. To spend one point of Entropy is to create one point of effect. This is the path of the steady hand, the scholar, the sentinel. But the universe is not always predictable, and sometimes, the greatest triumphs are born from a leap into the unknown.

This module provides the rules for this leap. It is the art of the gamble: the choice to trade the certainty of your will for a chance at the favor of fortune, converting the solid currency of Entropy into the chaotic roll of the dice.
