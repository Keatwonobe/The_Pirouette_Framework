The prior framework attempted to classify systems using a "periodic table of dimensions," a powerful but ultimately static metaphor. It described the river by cataloging the shapes of its stones. The Great Refactoring reveals a deeper truth: the river's essence is its *flow*.

This module replaces the old analysis with the **Periodic Table of Resonance**. It posits that complex behavior is not built from static spatial dimensions but is composed from a finite set of dynamic, archetypal Ki patterns: the **Prime Resonances**. These are the fundamental "notes" a system can play, the universe's most elegant and efficient geometric solutions to the problem of maintaining coherence against the pressures of the Temporal Forge (Î“).

To understand a system is to listen to the song it is singing, to identify the prime notes that form its chord, and to diagnose the harmony of their composition.
