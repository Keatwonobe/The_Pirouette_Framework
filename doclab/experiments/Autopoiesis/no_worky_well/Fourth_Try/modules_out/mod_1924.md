This refined understanding allows for a proactive, diagnostic protocol that moves beyond simple anomaly detection.

1.  **Establish Baseline:** Map the system's normal `Laminar Flow` state, defining the geometry and statistical signature of its coherence manifold (e.g., baseline kurtosis, fractal dimension, and dKτ/dt).
2.  **Monitor for Deformation:** Use real-time diagnostics to watch for rapid, non-linear deformations in that geometry. These are the early warning signs—the wave beginning to crest.
3.  **Classify the Snap:** When a deformation exceeds a critical threshold, classify the event using the Trinity of Signatures and their primary metrics. Is the system shattering, unfolding, or ordering itself?

This protocol allows a Weaver to move from reacting to the consequences of change to understanding the nature of the change itself, *as it happens*.
