A Coherence Fracture is a failure to follow the Principle of Maximal Coherence (`CORE-006`).
*   **The Lost Path:** In the pre-fracture state, the system is trapped in a precarious *local maximum* of coherence. Its internal order (`K_τ`) is high, but the cost of maintaining this state against the rising `Temporal Pressure` (`V_Γ`) makes its `Pirouette Lagrangian` (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`) unsustainable. All smooth, adaptive paths (geodesics) to a more stable state are cut off by its rigidity.
*   **The Violent Leap:** Unable to bend, the system breaks. The fracture is a violent, non-geodesic leap across the coherence manifold. It abandons the search for maximal coherence and plunges into a chaotic, low-coherence state. It is the universe's ultimate error-correction mechanism for a system that has become too rigid to evolve.
