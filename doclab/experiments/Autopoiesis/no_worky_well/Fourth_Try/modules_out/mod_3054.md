\section*{§10 · Outlook}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Unification:}  
  Next module \textbf{XAP-006D} will examine whether $\Gamma$ stiffness unifies with curvature of the SU(3) fiber to yield a single geometric origin for all masses.
\item \textbf{Experimental Hooks:}  
  Variations of $\Gamma_0$ with ambient coherence predict small temperature-dependent shifts in particle masses—potentially measurable in precision cold-beam experiments.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!50!black,title={Summary}]
XAP-006C derives rest masses for scalars, vectors, and fermions from the same Γ-field stiffness that defines temporal coherence.  
Mass is reinterpreted as the curvature of time itself—elastic resistance of the substrate—thereby completing the transition from geometry to matter within the Pirouette framework.
