summary: "Posits that a system's resilience is a function of the number-theoretic\
  \ geometry of its available stable resonant states (Ki configurations). Systems\
  \ with a prime number of states are topologically irreducible and lack harmonic\
  \ failure modes, granting them greater resilience against temporal pressure (\u0393\
  )."
