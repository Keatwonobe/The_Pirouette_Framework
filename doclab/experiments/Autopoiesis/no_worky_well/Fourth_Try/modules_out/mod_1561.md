The Shadow Gauge Protocol provides a universal lens for analyzing the observer effect across all domains.
*   **Quantum Physics:** Frames the measurement problem as a resonant coupling that forges a new, definite reality from a field of potential, with the Shadow Profile quantifying the nature of the "collapse."
*   **Social Sciences:** Quantifies the Hawthorne effect by modeling how a researcher's presence (`V_obs`) alters the coherence manifold of a group, changing its natural behavior.
*   **Psychology:** Assesses interviewer bias by measuring the `Information Transfer (Φ_Kτ)` between therapist and client, revealing the subtle ways one's own patterns shape another's narrative.
*   **Artificial Intelligence:** Enables an AI to audit its own self-monitoring, quantifying how the act of introspection alters its decision-making pathways.
