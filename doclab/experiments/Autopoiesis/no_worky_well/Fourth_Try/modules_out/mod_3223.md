The spiral coupling used throughout Pirouette is

$$
\mathcal L_{\rm int}=g\,\Gamma\,\dot T_a\cos\!\Delta\phi .
$$

* $\Gamma$ transforms as **$1/\gamma$** (tensor density in the funnel action, Sect. Γ·B).
* $\dot T_a$ transforms as **$1/\gamma$** (Eq. B4).

Their product $\Gamma\,\dot T_a$ therefore behaves as $1/\gamma^{2}$.
Combined with $d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}$ ($\propto\gamma$) and the two four-potentials $A_\mu A^\mu$ ($\propto\gamma$), the **action integral stays invariant**.
Hence the Ki–Γ–$T_a$ linkage is fully covariant—no hidden frame dependence.
