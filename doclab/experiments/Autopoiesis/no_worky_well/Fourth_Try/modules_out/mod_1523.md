The act of manipulation can be described formally as a perturbation of the target's path of maximal coherence, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian: `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`.

A system naturally evolves to maximize its coherence (`Kτ`) against the ambient pressure (`V_Γ`). The manipulator's strategy is to attack both terms. They degrade the "kinetic" term (`Kτ`) by eroding the target's internal coherence, and they amplify the "potential" term (`V_Γ`) by manufacturing external pressure.

This introduces a new, malicious "potential field," `V_manip`, into the target's environment. The target's new effective Lagrangian becomes:

`𝓛'_target = Kτ_target - (V_Γ + V_manip)`

The goal is to make `V_manip` so significant that the trajectory that maximizes `𝓛'_target` is no longer the target's own, but the one designed by the manipulator. Successful manipulation is the hijacking of a system's natural drive for coherence.
