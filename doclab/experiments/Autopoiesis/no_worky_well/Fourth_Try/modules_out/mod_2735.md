The optimal policy placement radius (r_p) satisfies:
[\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{\Delta E_{coh}}{R}\right)*{r=r_p} = 0]
where (\Delta E*{coh}) is the coherence energy restored per unit resource (R).

Empirically, (r_p \approx r_c) (the coherence core boundary) minimizes systemic expenditure while maximizing coherence flux recovery.
