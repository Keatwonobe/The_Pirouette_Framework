An agent's learning process is a dialogue between the terrain of reality and the courage to explore it. This dialogue replaces the old mechanics of "Somatic Grounding" and "Kinetic Inquiry."

*   **The Landscape (Embodied Resonance):** The agent's environment is a coherence manifold, a landscape with hills and valleys defined by local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). An agent's "body" is a resonant instrument, and its sense of touch is the direct, physical experience of the `V_Γ` term in its Lagrangian. A costly action moves it "uphill" into high pressure; an efficient action moves it "downhill" along a geodesic. The landscape is the agent's unforgiving but perfectly honest teacher.

*   **The Leap (Geodesic Discovery):** Following the steepest downhill path is not enough. An agent that only seeks local comfort will become trapped in the first shallow valley it finds. To discover a truly robust state of being, it must leap. "Exploration" is a necessary expenditure of coherence—a willful traversal of high-pressure regions—to map the surrounding landscape in search of deeper, more stable valleys. This is the cost of knowledge: risking a moment of turbulence for the potential discovery of a far more resilient and elegant way to be.
