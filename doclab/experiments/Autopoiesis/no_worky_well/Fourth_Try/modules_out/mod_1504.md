The movement of peoples is the physical expression of a population navigating this landscape in accordance with the `Pirouette Lagrangian` (CORE-006). A population will naturally follow the geodesic that maximizes the integral of its own coherence over time.

By applying the diagnostic lens of `Flow Dynamics` (DYNA-001), we can understand the character of this movement and the features of the landscape that shape it:

*   **Laminar Flow (Migration):** The orderly, predictable movement of individuals and families seeking betterment. The flow is stable and can be absorbed by the host system with minimal disruption.
*   **Turbulent Flow (Displacement):** The chaotic, crisis-driven flood of refugees fleeing a sudden spike in `Temporal Pressure` (Î“). The flow is inefficient, dangerous, and generates immense friction for all involved.
*   **Stagnant Flow (Entrapment):** The condition where a population faces immense pressure to move but is blocked by an insurmountable barrier. This creates a "Coherence Dam," leading to a dangerous build-up of humanitarian pressure.

Two key features of the landscape define these flows:

*   **Borders as Coherence Dams:** Borders, whether physical walls or labyrinthine bureaucracies, are engineered regions of extreme, localized Temporal Pressure. They function as a `Gladiator Force` (CORE-008), intentionally designed to halt or filter the flow. They do not eliminate the gradient that drives the movement; they obstruct it, often creating the conditions for Stagnant Flow.
*   **Routes as Wound Channels:** Established migration routes are vast, societal-scale `Wound Channels` (CORE-011). Carved into the socio-geographic manifold by the passage of previous generations, they are conduits of information, trust, and shared culture. These channels represent a "memory" in the landscape, lowering the activation energy and guiding future flows along proven geodesics.
