As established in CORE-010, an observer is a resonant system that projects an **Observer's Shadow** onto the coherence manifold of the system being observed. In the context of measurement, this shadow is the "probe"—the photon, the question, the tool used to gain information.

The interaction between the shadow and the system is not a collision; it is a resonant handshake. This handshake leaves a persistent geometric imprint in the manifolds of both the system and the observer. This imprint is the **Measurement Echo** (CORE-011). The echo left in the observer's manifold *is* the measurement data. The echo left in the system's manifold is the physical record of the interaction—the memory that it has been observed, which alters its lawful path of maximal coherence.
