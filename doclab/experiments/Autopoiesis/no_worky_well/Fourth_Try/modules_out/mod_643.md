Once the song is transcribed, we can listen for the sour notes. The Scalpel is a diagnostic tool that uses the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)** to move from transcription to prescription.

1.  **Locate the Geodesic:** First, apply the Lagrangian to the transcribed coherence data to determine the system's ideal evolutionary pathâ€”its geodesic of maximal coherence. This is the framework's predictive power, revealing the "path of least resistance" the system *should* be following.
2.  **Isolate the Critical Fractures:** Second, use Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA) to find where the system's actual history deviates most sharply from its geodesic. By quantifying the "coherence loss" associated with each event in the time-series, the Scalpel isolates the "critical few" events responsible for the vast majority (e.g., 80%) of the system's dissonance. The output is a short, actionable list of the system's primary wounds.
