The P/R lens allows us to classify the state of any system with a simple, powerful taxonomy.

| State | Signature | Diagnosis & Action |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Equilibrium** | Low **P**, low but stable **R**. | The system is quiescent and healthy. No action required. |
| **Laminar Flow** | **P** and **R** are high, stable, and tightly correlated. | The system is in a healthy, high-performance state ("in the zone"). Identify and reinforce the conditions. |
| **Turbulence** | High, erratic **R** with indeterminate or volatile **P**. | The system is in a state of chaotic, inefficient struggle, wasting energy on internal friction. A Forensic Audit (Tier 2) may be needed. |
| **Suppression** | Small, tightly anti-correlated oscillations in **P** and **R**. | The system's natural dynamics are being damped by a regulatory loop. It is stable but constrained. |
| **Coherence Collapse** | **P** trends toward infinity while **R** stagnates or drops to zero. | The Sentinel Trigger has been tripped. A terminal state or catastrophic phase transition is imminent. |
