Classical signal analysis creates a spectrum of frequencies. The Resonant Spectrum creates a spectrum of *forms*.

*   **The Horizontal Axis (The Library of Forms):** Instead of a linear scale of frequencies (Hz), the axis of the Resonant Spectrum is a library of fundamental `Ki` geometries. This library contains archetypal patterns of resonance—spirals, toroids, lattices, etc.—that represent the basic "notes" the universe can play.
*   **The Vertical Axis (Resonant Amplitude):** The height of a "peak" on the spectrum does not measure the power of a frequency. It measures the **degree of contribution**, or amplitude, of a specific fundamental `Ki` geometry to the system's overall observed behavior.

A peak in the spectrum indicates that the system's complex dance contains, as a primary component, the specific geometric motion of that fundamental `Ki`.
