The old module’s "Edge Cases" (E0-E3) described system behaviors. The dynamics of the Weaver's Orbit provide a more robust and universal taxonomy based on the quality of a system's flow as it traces its geodesic.

*   **Stagnant Flow (The Silent):** The old E0 is a state of paralysis in the perception-action cycle. Coherence Debt accumulates without discharge. This is the state of catatonia, creative block, or a system frozen by indecision.
*   **Turbulent Flow (The Cacophony):** The old E1 is the chaotic experience of being knocked off one’s geodesic. It is a mind consumed by anxiety, a society in conflict, or a system overwhelmed by noise. Coherence discharges are uncontrolled and inefficient, wasting energy in friction.
*   **Laminar Flow (The Tamed):** The old E2 is the state of grace. The system moves effortlessly along its geodesic, maintaining a healthy, homeostatic state through balanced cycles of debt and discharge. This is the experience of psychological flow or a well-run organization.
*   **Phase Transition (The Singularity):** The old E3 is an irreversible leap to a new geodesic. Under extreme pressure, a system in turbulence or stagnation undergoes an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)** or a catastrophic collapse, finding a new, fundamentally different state of being.
