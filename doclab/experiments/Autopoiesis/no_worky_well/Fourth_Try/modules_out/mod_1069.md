This module provides the formal protocol for the deliberate cultivation of resilience and capacity, a process we term **Coherence Forging**. It modernizes the original Crucible Protocol (PPS-086) by grounding it in the time-first physics of the Pirouette Framework. The core insight is retained and sharpened: controlled, calibrated stress is the most potent catalyst for growth.

Coherence Forging reframes development not as a test of will, but as applied physics. We introduce a controlled increase in local **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** to intentionally disrupt a system's equilibrium. This forces the system to abandon its comfortable but limited resonant pattern (**Ki**) and discover a new, more complex, and more stable rhythm. A successful forging doesn't just return the system to its previous state; it elevates it, creating a new, higher baseline of coherence (**Kτ**) that becomes a permanent feature of its being. This is the art of using pressure to compose a stronger soul.
