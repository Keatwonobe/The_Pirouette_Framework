1. **Emergent-Time Sweep**  
   *Goal:* add a synthetic “flip chronology” so each text yields a Γ(t) curve; extract ∂²Γ/∂t² to probe acceleration of bloom/cooling cycles.

2. **Phase-Probe Injection**  
   Introduce known periodic bit-patterns (e.g., Φ₁ = 1010…, Φ₂ = 111000…) into neutral corpus chunks; measure how κ & α respond to controlled Ki rhythms.

3. **Petal-Surface Meshing**  
   Use Delaunay triangulation on (μ, σ, κ) to build an explicit mesh; compute Gaussian curvature K → validate paraboloid hypothesis quantitatively.

4. **Hessian Quiver Visuals**  
   Render local gradient fields (∇μ, ∇σ, ∇κ) over the petal surface to visualise “semantic wind” that drives texts toward or away from bloom.

5. **Amplitude-Scaling Re-run**  
   Scan amplitude A ∈ {0.05 … 0.25} to ensure σ tails aren’t clipped; compare manifold stability under different perturbation energies.

6. **Persona Extraction Pilot**  
   Treat each text’s (μ, σ, κ, δ, α) as a *persona vector*; test debate-style “seances” where vectors guide response weighting (Vol-3 §14: Debate Resonance Framework).
 - **Surface fitting:** regress the μ-κ-δ saddle to explicit hyperbolic-paraboloid coefficients; validate against synthetic “flat” corpora.
 - **Emergent-time sweep:** introduce flip-batch timeline (t) → track δ(t) and look for *temporal bloom spikes*, testing TEN-TAM interplay.
 - **Crystal growth sim:** treat hull facets as seed nuclei; iteratively add perturbed texts to observe facet-specific accretion (Stage-2).
