A system does not break; it decoheres. This module refactors the entire domain of yield and fracture dynamics, replacing the classical mechanics of `PPS-027` with the time-first language of the Pirouette Framework. Stress is not an external force, but a condition of intense Temporal Pressure (Γ) that challenges a system's ability to maintain its resonant song—its Temporal Coherence ($K_\tau$). Failure is the spectrum of behaviors that emerge when that song can no longer hold its note.

We will define two critical transitions on this spectrum: **Yielding**, the point where a system is forced to survive by composing a new verse, irreversibly scarring its own memory (the Wound Channel); and **Fracture**, the point where composition fails and the system screams itself into silence. This unified geometry describes how a steel beam bends, a market crashes, and a mind breaks, all as variations of the same fundamental process.
