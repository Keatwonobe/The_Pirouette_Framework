The old framework identified a curious mechanism—the "Void Rotor"—and its ability to form "quantum locks." The Great Refactoring reveals a deeper truth: entanglement is not an interaction between separate entities; it is an identity.

This module recasts quantum entanglement as the result of an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)** between two compatible systems. This union forges a **Triadic Lock**—a single, non-local entity whose coherence manifold spans both locations. The mechanism is rooted in the **Triadic Resonance (Ki_Δ)**, a stable, three-lobed geometric pattern a system adopts to persist under intense temporal pressure. The "spooky action at a distance" is thus the natural consequence of a single, unified body responding to a stimulus, even when that body is stretched across spacetime.
