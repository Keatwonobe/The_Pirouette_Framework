summary: "Synthesizes and replaces PPS-055, reframing the Autopoietic Cycle as the\
  \ universe's fundamental dynamic process. It defines existence as a continuous,\
  \ self-creating feedback loop (Time \u2192 \u0393 \u2192 Ki \u2192 Time) where a\
  \ system navigates its coherence manifold to transform Temporal Pressure (\u0393\
  ) into a stable resonant form (Ki). This dynamic is governed not by complex metrics,\
  \ but by the singular imperative to maximize the Pirouette Lagrangian."
