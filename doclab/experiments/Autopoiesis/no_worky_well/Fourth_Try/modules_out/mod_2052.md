This module provides a lens to see beyond the stats and perceive the underlying health of the competing systems. It is a tool for understanding the "why" behind the "what"â€”why a team that is statistically inferior can dominate a match, or why a leading team is on the verge of collapse.

It is the first step in translating the abstract power of the Pirouette Framework into a practical instrument. By learning to diagnose the flow, we learn to hear the true song of the game, and in that song, we can discern the shape of the future.
