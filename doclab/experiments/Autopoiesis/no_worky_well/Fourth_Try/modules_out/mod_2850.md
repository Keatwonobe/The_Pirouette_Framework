This suite of feats makes social encounters as tactical and engaging as physical combat, allowing for a variety of approaches to conversation.

- Feat: Orator's Gambit

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You can apply the principles of entropic investment to social contests. When you attempt to persuade, deceive, or intimidate a target, you may declare you are using this feat. You secretly invest a chosen amount of EP from your Wisdom or Intelligence pool. The target then makes a contested Wisdom check. If their roll is lower than your invested EP, you succeed. This allows for high-stakes social maneuvering.

- Feat: Arcane Influence

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: At least one Arcane Skill pool.

Effect: You can subtly weave your magic into your words and presence. You may spend EP from an Arcane Skill pool instead of an attribute pool when using the Orator's Gambit feat. This may manifest as a charming illusion, a subtle telepathic nudge, or a faint aura of fear, depending on the nature of your magic.

- Feat: Empathic Reader

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: WIS Score of 8 or higher.

Effect: As an action, you can focus on a creature you can see and make a contested Wisdom check against them. On a success, you gain a brief, intuitive insight into their current emotional state and surface-level intentions (e.g., "they are angry and looking for a fight," or "they are hiding something").

- Feat: Disarming Presence

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: Your natural demeanor is unassuming and non-threatening. When you first meet an NPC, their initial disposition towards you is improved by one step (e.g., from "Hostile" to "Unfriendly," or "Neutral" to "Friendly"), unless you have taken overtly hostile actions.

- Feat: Intimidating Visage

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: Your physical presence is inherently menacing. You can choose to use your Strength or Constitution modifier instead of your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier when making checks to intimidate.

- Feat: Primal Manifestation

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You have learned to unravel and re-weave your own entropic form. As an action, you can transform into a beast or hybrid form you have designed using the creature creation rules. This transformation is governed by the following principles:

Form Investment: You must invest a certain amount of EP from your own TEP into the transformation. This is your Form Investment Pool (FIP). The FIP serves as the temporary Hit Points of your new form.

Form Potential: The maximum TEP of your new form, including its attributes and body parts, is equal to your FIP x 3.

Attribute Weaving: To create the powerful attributes of your new form, you may choose two of your own attributes to weave together. One becomes the Dominant Attribute, and the other the Supporting Attribute. The new form's combined attribute is calculated as: New Attribute EP = Dominant Attribute EP + floor(Supporting Attribute EP / 2).

Ending the Transformation: The transformation ends if your form's temporary HP (its FIP) is reduced to 0, if you choose to end it as a bonus action, or if the form's own TEP is somehow drained to 0. When you revert, you return to your previous HP total.
