A Knot does not simply *store* information; the topology of the Knot *is* the information. A simple loop (an Unknot) contains the memory of "return." A Trefoil knot contains a more complex memory of "a twist, an embrace, and a return." This form of memory is profoundly robust, protected not by an energy barrier that can be overcome, but by a topological one that cannot be bypassed without severing the pattern itself. To erase the memory is to destroy the entity.

With this new grounding, we can define modern metrics for analyzing a Knot's properties:

*   **Topological Persistence (τ_knot):** A measure of a Knot's lifespan. It is directly proportional to its total internal coherence, amplified by a `Topological Coherence Factor (C_topo)`—a function of its crossing number (`c`) and other geometric invariants.
    `τ_knot ∝ T_a * C_topo(c) / f(Γ)`
    Where `T_a` is the system's intrinsic temporal coherence and `f(Γ)` represents the erosive force of the environment.

*   **Information Content (I_knot):** As defined in CORE-013, information is a direct measure of coherence. The information encoded in a Knot's topology is therefore proportional to its total amplified coherence, `K_τ(knot)`.
    `I_knot ∝ K_τ(knot)`
