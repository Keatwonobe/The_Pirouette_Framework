APPENDIX A — Dictionary Stubs (to be expanded in MATH‑019)
• Coherence manifold → oriented fiber bundle with connection; conserved current from Noether symmetry of ℒ_p.
• Gladiator feedback → nonlinear self‑coupling term; RG flow on (Γ,K) with fixed‑point structure.
• Wound channel → topological defect class; integer index = portal selector T.

APPENDIX B — Template Artifacts
• Freeze Manifest (YAML): commit, anchor choice, U/T values, seeds.
• Prereg Docket (Markdown): targets, priors, solver tolerances, uncertainty recipe.
• Ratio Test Sheet: list of admissible hadron‑insulating ratios with derivations.
