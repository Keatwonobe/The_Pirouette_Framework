At the sub-atomic scale, this feedback is extreme and non-linear. This is the domain of the strong nuclear force, the quintessential Gladiator.

Asymptotic Freedom: When quarks are extremely close, their Ki rhythms overlap and harmonize. They exist in a shared state of high coherence with minimal feedback, allowing them to move freely within the proton's "arena."

Confinement: If a quark attempts to move away from its partners, the distance causes their rhythms to desynchronize. To maintain its own coherence, the quark must resonate more intensely. This intensity feeds directly back into the local temporal pressure, causing V_Î“ to spike. The "cost" of coherence rises exponentially with distance.

The path of maximal coherence becomes a frantic retreat back to the group. If enough energy is supplied to pull the quark further, the temporal pressure between the quarks becomes so immense that it "snaps," creating a new quark-antiquark pair from the energy of the field (the Temporal Forge). The gladiator cannot escape the arena; trying to flee only populates the arena with more gladiators.
