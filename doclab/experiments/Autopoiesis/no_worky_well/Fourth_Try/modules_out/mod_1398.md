This protocol guides the Weaver from a raw data stream to a finished map of the local confinement landscape.

1.  **Ingest & Vectorize:** Begin with an ordered stream of events (e.g., statements in a debate, positions of a particle) and convert them into a sequence of high-dimensional vectors.
2.  **Calculate Path Density (δ):** Within a sliding window, compute the average semantic or spatial divergence between consecutive events. The inverse of this value (plus a small epsilon to prevent division by zero) is the Path Density, δ.
3.  **Calculate Coherence Curvature (γ):** Within the same window, measure the change in the system's trajectory. This is the absolute difference in divergence between the start and end of the window, normalized by the window size. This is the practical gradient of coherence, or γ.
4.  **Compute Confinement Strength (κ_G):** For each window, multiply the two metrics: `κ_G = δ × γ`.
5.  **Map the Arenas:** Plot the resulting κ_G-field over time or space. Local maxima in this field are the centers of "Cognitive Gravity Wells," ideological strongholds, or stable physical structures. These are the arenas forged by the Gladiator Force.
