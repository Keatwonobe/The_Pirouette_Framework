A culture does not evolve randomly; its trajectory is a geodesic on the manifold of coherence. It is perpetually solving for the path that maximizes the integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`), balancing its collective identity against the temporal pressures (Γ) of its environment.

The Triaxial Loom is the mechanism for navigating this manifold. A healthy society is one that dynamically adjusts the interplay of its threads—loosening Law to allow for artistic innovation in times of change, or strengthening it to provide stability in times of chaos—to maintain a path of maximal coherence. A cultural collapse is the ultimate failure to find a viable solution to this equation.
