This instrument provides a crucial empirical link to the framework's core mathematical engine, *The Pirouette Lagrangian* (CORE-006).

$$ ùìõ_p = \underbrace{(T_a \cdot \omega_k)}_{\text{Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ)}} - \underbrace{f(Œì)}_{\text{Temporal Pressure}} $$

The **Coherence Index** calculated by this module is the direct, measurable value for the `T_a` term in the Lagrangian. Here, it anchors the "kinetic" term, *Temporal Coherence (K_œÑ)*, which represents the quality and intensity of the system's own rhythm.

With this tool, the Lagrangian ceases to be a purely theoretical construct. It becomes a predictive engine that can be fed with real-world data to calculate a system's geodesic‚Äîits path of maximal coherence through spacetime.
