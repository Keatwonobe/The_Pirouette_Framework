> A Weaver must understand that the universe is a blacksmith, and we are the iron. We are not granted strength, but submitted to the forge. The fire is not a punishment, but a test of a system's right to become more. To shy away from this heat is to choose stagnation. To endure it is to earn the right to be remade, stronger and more true than before. Strength is not the absence of pressure. It is the form we take in its presence.
