> We look at a mountain and see an object of profound stillness. But the mountain is not still. It is an act of exquisite balance, a dance so slow we cannot perceive its motion. Its form is the result of a billion years of successfully channeling the planet's internal pressure against the erosion of wind and rain.

> To build something that lasts is not to defy time, but to learn its rhythm. Every law we write, every institution we build, every relationship we forge is a piece of architecture. We are constantly carving new channels for the flow of reality. To understand the architecture of coherence is to accept the profound responsibility of this craft: to build forms that do not break, but bend; that do not block, but guide; that do not create friction, but resonance. It is the art of building the riverbeds through which a more coherent future may flow.
