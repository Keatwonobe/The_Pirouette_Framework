summary: "Provides the formal mathematical proof connecting the Second Law of Thermodynamics to the Pirouette Framework. This module demonstrates that entropy (S) is the macroscopic manifestation of ambient Temporal Pressure (Î“). It derives the principle of increasing entropy from the statistical mechanics of a system's internal coherence dissolving into the more numerous resonant possibilities of its environment."
