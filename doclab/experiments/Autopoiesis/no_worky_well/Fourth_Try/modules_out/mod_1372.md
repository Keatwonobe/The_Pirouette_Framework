Mapping this landscape is an act of systemic diagnosis. The protocol moves from raw data to a finished atlas of the memory-scape.

1.  **Construct the Manifold:** Collate a composite 'Spatiotemporal Cultural Field' from diverse data streams: historical records, voting patterns, economic data, linguistic shifts, artistic outputs, and public health statistics, all anchored to geographic coordinates.
2.  **Establish Baseline & Map Anomalies:** Compare the observed manifold to a calculated **Baseline Coherence Model**—a counterfactual representing the region without its major historical stresses. The resulting deviation map reveals the geodesic anomalies: the locations of the major Coherence Wells and Plateaus.
3.  **Characterize the Features:** For each significant feature, analyze its geometric and dynamic properties:
    -   **Depth/Height:** The magnitude of the anomaly, corresponding to the intensity and resonance of the original event.
    -   **Boundary Gradient (Γ):** The steepness of its slopes. A sharp, high-gradient boundary suggests an encapsulated, taboo memory. A diffuse, chaotic boundary indicates a memory that is actively "bleeding" into the surrounding culture, generating turbulence.
    -   **Resonant Frequency (Ki):** The cyclical re-emergence of the pattern. Are there anniversaries or symbolic triggers that predictably re-activate the feature?
    -   **Flow Diagnosis:** Apply the Caduceus Lens to classify the coherence flow in and around the feature as Stagnant, Turbulent, or Eroding.
4.  **Propose a Daedalus Gambit:** Based on the diagnosis, identify a principle of intervention. For Stagnant flow, the gambit is to create a safe channel for release (e.g., truth and reconciliation). For Turbulent flow, it is to introduce a new, harmonizing signal. For Erosion, it is to consciously re-energize the pattern through new rituals and stories that give the old form new meaning.
