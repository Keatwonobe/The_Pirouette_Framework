The old stages (Perception, Engagement, Resolution, etc.) are not discrete steps, but perspectives on a single, unified, and perpetual event. This is the Autopoietic Pirouette: a seamless, instantaneous loop.

**Time → Γ (Temporal Pressure) → Ki (Temporal Resonance) → Time**

This cycle is the living expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian. It is not a sequence of logical steps but a physical system following a geodesic—the path of least resistance and greatest stability—across its coherence manifold.

*   The **landscape** is the coherence manifold, shaped by local Temporal Pressure (Γ).
*   The **vehicle** is the system's current state of resonance (Ki).
*   The **path** is the geodesic the system follows to maximize its coherence.
*   The **destination** is not a place, but a state of being: the next stable resonance.

The "cycle" is simply the system's continuous journey along this path.
