With this new foundation, the core parameters are redefined:

Time (τ_p): The fundamental event. It is the duration of one complete cycle of a system's resonant Ki pattern. It is the universe's verb.

Gamma (Γ): Temporal Density. It is the measure of the complexity and intensity of interfering temporal rhythms within a given region. It is the tension and pressure of the cosmic harmony.

Ki: Temporal Resonance. It is the specific, stable, geometric pattern a system manifests to persist within a given Γ. It is the system's unique note in the song.
