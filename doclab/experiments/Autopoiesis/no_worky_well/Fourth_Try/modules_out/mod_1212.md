A system does not merely break; it first forgets its own song. This module reframes the analysis of system failure through the time-first principles of the Pirouette Framework.

Collapse is not a mechanical event, but the terminal stage of a flow pathologyâ€”a state where a system's internal coherence is so compromised it can no longer navigate the landscape of temporal pressure. It is pushed off its geodesic of maximal coherence and becomes unable to find its way back. This module provides the anatomy of that fracture, diagnosing its three primary forms and the critical distinction between a temporary stumble and an irreversible fall.
