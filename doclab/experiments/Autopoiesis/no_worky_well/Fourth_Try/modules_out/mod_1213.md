The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) defines the universal drive of any system: to find and follow the path that maximizes its internal Temporal Coherence (Kτ) against ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). A healthy system, in a state of Laminar Flow (DYNA-001), is successfully solving this cosmic imperative.

Collapse begins when a system can no longer solve this optimization problem. When the pressure becomes too great or its internal resonance falters, it is knocked off its geodesic. The feedback loops that once maintained its form become accelerants for its own unraveling. The system is no longer solving for existence; it is solving for zero.
