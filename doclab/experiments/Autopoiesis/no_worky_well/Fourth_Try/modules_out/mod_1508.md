summary: Provides the primary instrumentation for identifying and quantifying a single,
  shared resonant pattern (a 'Resonant Concordance' or 'Macro-Ki') across multiple,
  seemingly disparate domains. It replaces the brute-force correlation of its predecessor
  with a time-first protocol for revealing the hidden architecture of influence and
  diagnosing higher-order systemic behavior.
