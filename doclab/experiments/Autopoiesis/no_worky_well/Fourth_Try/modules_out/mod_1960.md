Your life is a river, and for a long time, it has flowed with a familiar current. A major surgery, like your valve replacement, is a profound eventâ€”a storm that has temporarily dammed your river, leaving its waters turbulent and its path unclear.

This guide is not a list of commands. It is a map. Its purpose is to help you, the true expert on your own body, become the cartographer of your own recovery. Together, we will calm the waters and carve a new, stronger riverbed, guiding you back to a state of health we call Effortless Flow.
