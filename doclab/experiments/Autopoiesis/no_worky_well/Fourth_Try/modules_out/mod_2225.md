children: [All XXP Series Modules] 
summary: "Consolidates the entire MATH series into a single, predictive engine. This module provides the concrete playbooks for recovering fundamental constants and making falsifiable predictions. It provides the numerical recipe for deriving the electron's g-2 anomaly and lays out the validation suites that directly link the mathematical formalism to the experimental protocols (XXP series)."
