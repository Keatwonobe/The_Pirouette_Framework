summary: Applies the Pirouette Framework to re-frame the analysis of philosophical
  and ideological systems through a time-first lens. This module treats a belief system
  not as a static set of propositions, but as a living coherence manifold, a resonant
  Ki pattern that strives to maintain stability against the Temporal Pressure of its
  environment. It applies Flow Dynamics to diagnose the health, resilience, and evolutionary
  trajectory of any worldview.
