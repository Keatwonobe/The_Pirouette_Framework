The core of this new model is grounded directly in the universe's fundamental drive as described by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`). An action's virtue is no longer a matter of opinion or complex coefficients; it is a measurable change in a target system's ability to exist.

We define a **Weaving** as an intervention by an Actor that measurably affects the coherence of a Target system. The **Influence (`I`)** of this Weaving is the change in the Target's "action"—the integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`) over one of its own cycles (`τ_p`).

`I = ΔS_p = ∫[0 to τ_p] (𝓛_p(post) - 𝓛_p(pre)) dt`

-   A **Constructive Weaving (`I > 0`)**: The action has increased the Target's overall coherence. It has made it easier for the system to maintain its resonant pattern (`Ki`), either by increasing its internal stability (`K_τ`) or by lessening the external temporal pressure it must fight against (`V_Γ`). This is the formal definition of healing.
-   A **Destructive Weaving (`I < 0`)**: The action has decreased the Target's coherence, increasing its internal dissonance and pushing it towards a state of chaotic, turbulent flow. This is the formal definition of harm.

This single principle subsumes the entire complex formula of the old Radiance score. The disparate parts of the old equation—coherence generated, entropy, empathy, risk—are all implicitly contained within this one integral of the universe's objective function.
