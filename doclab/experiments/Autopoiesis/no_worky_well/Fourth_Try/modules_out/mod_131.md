summary: "Recontextualizes entropy as a measure of the dissonance within the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). Defines information as the degree of a system's coherence (Kτ). The Second Law of Thermodynamics is thus framed as the Principle of Coherence Degradation, where stable patterns are inevitably eroded by ambient temporal noise, a process that life and the Alchemical Union locally and temporarily reverse."
