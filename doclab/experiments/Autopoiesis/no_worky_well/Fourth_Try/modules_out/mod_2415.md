Substrate parameters (conductance, latency, noise spectra) renormalize into effective (a,b,c,λ,g). Practical rule:

• Increase in latency → raises a (harder to cohere)
• Increased noise at resonant bands → raises effective b (stronger nonlinear damping)
• Bandwidth constraints → renormalize c (stiffer gradients)

Mapping χ_S must be calibrated per domain, but **flow topology** (fixed points, eigenvalues) remains substrate-invariant.
