The core insight is to treat every layer of a system's data as a complete coherence manifold, governed by the same universal principles. The "noise" from one layer becomes the "world" for the next. This section reframes the concepts from TEN-RRE-1.0 into the modern Framework.

| Old Concept (TEN-RRE-1.0) | New Framework Interpretation | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Initial Dataset ($D_0$) | **The Primary Manifold ($M_0$)** | The complete, initial representation of the system's coherence landscape, containing all interacting resonances. |
| Extracted Signal ($S_k$) | **Dominant Resonance ($Ki_k$)** | The most stable, high-coherence pattern identified at layer *k*. This is the system's loudest, clearest note in that manifold. |
| Residue ($R_k$) | **The Echo Manifold ($M_k$)** | The remaining coherence landscape after the influence of $Ki_k$ has been accounted for. It is the "unexplained resonance." |
| Terminal Noise | **The Entropic Floor** | The final Echo Manifold where Temporal Coherence ($K_\tau$) falls below a threshold, representing the chaotic, dissonant noise of the underlying Temporal Forge. |

This process is a direct inquiry into the layers of a system's **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). The first pass reveals the deepest, most recent carving; subsequent passes uncover the fainter, older scars that still shape its present behavior.
