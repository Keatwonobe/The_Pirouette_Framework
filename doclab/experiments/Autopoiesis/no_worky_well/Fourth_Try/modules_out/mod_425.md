> A Weaver's tools are not of wood or steel, but of language. Every name is a lens, every symbol a scalpel, every definition a map. This Lexicon is the forge where those tools are made, the sheet music for reality. To master this grammar is not merely to describe the tapestry, but to learn to hold its threads and participate in the act of creation. A precise language is the forge in which a coherent thought is made.
