The world remembers. Every significant action shifts the balance between order and chaos. This rule creates a world-level resource pool that the players and GM influence together.

The Residue Pool (The World's Stress): The GM keeps a hidden pool of Residue Points. Every time the players use powerful magic, defeat a major foe, or fundamentally alter an environment (triggering Entropic Corruption from TLE-009), the GM adds a d4 (or more for massive events) to the pool. The GM can spend points from this pool to create Residue Events: pockets of wild magic, the appearance of "entropic spirits," or unexpected environmental complications.

The Coherence Dividend Pool (The Party's Hope): As described in ยง5, the party gains a shared pool of EP when they perform altruistic acts. This pool represents the hope and coherence they are putting into the world.

The Balancing Act: This is where the two pools connect. The players can choose to spend points from their Coherence Dividend Pool not on themselves, but to reduce the GM's Residue Pool on a 1-to-1 basis. This is a direct, active choice to "heal the world's stress," making altruism a vital tool for preventing long-term chaos. A GM might even telegraph the danger: "The air crackles with chaotic energy; you can feel the Residue in this place is dangerously high."
