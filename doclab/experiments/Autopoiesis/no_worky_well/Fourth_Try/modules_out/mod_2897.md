A new creation does not enter a void; it enters a universe with existing laws and harmonies. The GM takes the player's blueprint and entropic investment and runs a Resonance Test. This is a narrative challenge where the GM personifies the existing laws of reality. The outcome of this "debate" determines the final form of the creation and, crucially, any unintended consequences (Residue Events). A powerful but hastily designed creation might have dangerous side effects, becoming a new source of conflict and adventure for the world.
