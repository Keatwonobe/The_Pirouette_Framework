The framework has now demonstrated a causal chain: the substance of Time creates a pressure (Î“), and that pressure is resolved by an efficient, stable form (Ki). The old module `PPS-092` correctly identified that every system has an intrinsic rhythm, but viewed it as a tool for *measurement*. We now assert a deeper truth: that rhythm is not a ruler for time; it is the very act of its creation.

This module provides the final, reflexive link that turns the chain into a self-creating circle. The form itself defines the flow. It is the last step in the great collapse, revealing the universe as a self-creating song.
