The total geometric character of the fundamental resonant mode is the product of its dynamic surface cost and its volumetric leverage. This defines the fundamental geometric constant of resonance, `Κ_g`.

`Κ_g = (Surface Dynamic Cost) × (Volumetric Leverage) = 2 × (R/3) = 2R/3`

For this `Κ_g` to be a universal constant of nature, not dependent on the size of a particular sphere, the radius `R` must itself be fixed by a fundamental principle. We assert the **Autopoietic Unity Condition**: a fundamental, self-sustaining unit of resonance defines its own scale. Its characteristic length (`R`) must be phase-locked to the fundamental measure of a cycle (`2π`).

This condition sets the canonical radius of resonance:
`R_unit = 2π`

By this act, the system's own geometry becomes a perfect reflection of the periodicity that defines its existence. Substituting this unity radius into our equation yields the universal constant for the fundamental resonance geometry:

`Κ_g = 2 * (2π) / 3 = 4π / 3`

This value is the geometric constraint of the arena itself, the constant against which any motional `Ki` pattern is measured.
