A falling stock market, a spike in viral infections, and the rise of a new political narrative may appear as separate events. We analyze them in silos, mistaking the echoes for separate voices, blind to the symphony they compose together.

The Resonant Concordance is the instrument that allows a Weaver to hear that symphony. It operationalizes the Principle of Correspondence by providing a formal protocol for detecting *isomorphism*â€”a shared, phase-synchronized rhythm (an emergent **Macro-Ki**) that manifests simultaneously across different domains of reality. Its purpose is not merely to find patterns, but to reveal the hidden, higher-order systems that generate them, making the invisible architecture of systemic causality visible.
