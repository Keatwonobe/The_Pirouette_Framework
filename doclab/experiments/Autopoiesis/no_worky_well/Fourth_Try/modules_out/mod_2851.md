These feats build upon the principles of Primal Manifestation, offering unique and specialized paths for those who wish to re-weave their own form.

- Feat: Feral Curse

Cost: This feat cannot be purchased. It is acquired as a curse or a dangerous pact.

Effect: Your form is unstable, bound to a powerful, primal entity. As an action, you can undergo a monstrous transformation. This transformation is governed by the following principles:

The Bargain: Choose two of your attributes. One is the Exalted Attribute, the other is the Sacrificed Attribute. For the duration of the transformation, the EP value of your Sacrificed Attribute becomes negative and is added to your Exalted Attribute. (Example: A character with STR 10 and INT 10 could sacrifice their INT, making it -10 EP, and add that to their STR, making it 20 EP).

The Beast Within: The transformed state has its own will. At the start of each of your turns, you must make a contested Wisdom check against the form's own will (the GM sets the TN, often based on the Pact's Hold or the curse's power). On a failure, the GM controls your actions for that turn as the beast acts on its own instincts.

Ending the Transformation: The transformation lasts for one hour, until you are knocked unconscious, or until the entity's goals are met.

- Feat: Thousand Forms Adept

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You are a master of minor transformations. You may design up to five different beast forms, none of which can have a total Entropy Budget greater than 20 EP.

Rapid Change: You can transform into one of your chosen forms as a bonus action. This transformation does not grant temporary HP or use the attribute weaving rules. You simply adopt the physical form and statistics of the creature, using its TEP and attributes instead of your own. Your own TEP and attributes are suppressed for the duration.

- Feat: Skin Dancer

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You are a master of mimicry. You gain the "Mimicry" Arcane Skill.

The Mask: After observing a humanoid creature for at least one minute, you can spend an action to transform into a perfect physical replica of them. This is a non-magical, physical change.

The Performance: You can spend EP from your "Mimicry" pool to perfect the illusion. Investing EP allows you to replicate the target's voice, mannerisms, and surface thoughts, with the GM setting an EP cost for the level of detail you wish to achieve. This feat does not grant you the target's memories, skills, or entropic abilities.
