This modernization allows for more direct measurement and intervention, shifting the focus from the old triaxial fields to their unified temporal origin.

*   **Temporal Desynchronization (`Δτ`):** Continuous measurement of the phase difference between agent and environment. Flow is maintained when `|Δτ|` is minimal.
*   **Temporal Pressure Variance (`σ_Γ`):** The stability of the challenge. Flow requires a smooth, non-volatile level of ambient temporal pressure.
*   **Coherence Flux (`Φ_C`):** The efficiency of the agent's energy cycle. In flow, this value should approach its theoretical maximum.
*   **Biometric Proxies:** Heart-rate variability and EEG synchrony remain excellent proxies, now understood as physical manifestations of the body's successful temporal resonance.

The training protocols from PPS-038 are retained and reinforced, now with the explicit goal of training an agent's ability to quickly and robustly synchronize their internal clock with their environment.
