The anthropological practice of "Thick Description" is the art of reading this complex, layered manifold. An action's meaning is derived from its resonance within the vast, shared Wound Channel of its culture. Myths and shared histories are not mere stories; they are the deepest geometric patterns in the collective manifold, the riverbeds that guide the flow of individual action. Thick Description is the act of reverse-engineering the local expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian that governs a people by mapping an action's trajectory through this landscape.
