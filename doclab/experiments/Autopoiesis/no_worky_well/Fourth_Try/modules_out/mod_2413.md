When Γ varies slowly in space or time, λ flows generate **crossover scaling** between:

(i) ψ-dominated fixed point (λ→λ*)  and  (ii) Γ-driven line (λ→∞) with damped ψ-fluctuations.

Crossover function:

X(L/ξ_Γ) with ξ_Γ ∼ |Γ−Γ_c|^{-ν_Γ}

Observable susceptibility:

χ_P(L,Γ) ≈ L^{γ_P/ν} ϕ( L/ξ,  L/ξ_Γ )

Empirically, this produces: (a) triad-detuning band shrinkage in COG under Γ load; (b) Θ-threshold sharpening in SOCIO as Γ-proxy (transaction entropy) rises.
