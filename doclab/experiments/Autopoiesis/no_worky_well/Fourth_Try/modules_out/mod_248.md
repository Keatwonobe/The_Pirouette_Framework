Every contest is audited by entropy. The Resonant Test is an information-rich but entropically expensive process. It accelerates Coherence Degradation (CORE-013) by forcing both systems into a state of high stress, expending immense energy simply to maintain form.

Victory, therefore, belongs not to the most powerful, but to the most *efficient*. The winning pattern is the one that can sustain the most stable and efficient resonance—the highest `K_τ`—for the lowest energetic cost against the intense, shared pressure `V_Γ`. Form without balance is self-defeating. The system that can withstand external dissonance without fraying into the background noise is the one that proves its coherence is not a fragile accident, but a robust and undeniable law.
