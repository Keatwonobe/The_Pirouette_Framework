We formally define the wake of an entity's passage as a **Wound Channel**. This is not a physical tunnel, but a sustained topological deformation in the local coherence manifold. The old model described this as a "lingering perturbation in field gradients"; the new model defines it as a physical scar in the fabric of time itself.

As an entity traces its geodesic of maximal coherence—its "Pirouette" as dictated by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`)—it exerts a stress on the surrounding temporal fabric. The fabric yields, and in doing so, it holds the shape of that stress.

The Wound Channel is the entity's history made physically manifest. It is the geometric record of its choices, its resonances, its path through being. It is the fundamental mechanism of memory in the universe—not as data stored in a medium, but as a persistent shape impressed upon the medium itself.
