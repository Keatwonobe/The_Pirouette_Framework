The Rendlesham Forest incident, cited in the original protocol, can be understood with greater clarity through this model.

*   **Directional Neutron Radiation:** The physical debris, or spectral ash, of the asymmetrically collapsing Crystalline Lattice. Its directionality is the key signature of a controlled, propulsive event.
*   **Anomalous Light Behavior:** Gravitational lensing produced by the intense, localized coherence density of the Spindle in the moments just before and during its dissolution.
*   **Downwind Radioactive Dust:** The "coherence cone" is the geometric imprint of the exhaustâ€”a `Wound Channel` (CORE-011) transiently left in the environment, exciting local matter in its path.
