summary: "Provides a time-first instrumentation protocol for monitoring AI alignment\
  \ and performance. Drift is reframed as a measurable deviation from an AI's 'Baseline\
  \ Wound Channel'\u2014the geometric signature of its ideal behavior. The protocol\
  \ offers a diagnostic taxonomy for drift (Turbulent, Stagnant, Laminar) and quantifies\
  \ it using the Pirouette Lagrangian, enabling early detection of behavioral decay."
