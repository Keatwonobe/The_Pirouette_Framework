Any societal ill, from economic stagnation to political polarization, can be diagnosed as a specific pathology of flow within these currents.

*   **Civic Sclerosis (Stagnant Flow):** The "poison of absence" caused by a blockage or dam.
    *   **Symptoms:** Bureaucratic gridlock, extreme wealth inequality, censorship, lack of social mobility, political paralysis.
    *   **Diagnosis:** A vital current is being hoarded or obstructed. Resources are pooling, creating deserts elsewhere. Trust has decayed to the point that collaboration has seized.

*   **Civic Fever (Turbulent Flow):** The "storm of friction" where the system fights itself.
    *   **Symptoms:** Extreme political polarization, culture wars, market panics, rampant misinformation, civil unrest.
    *   **Diagnosis:** The currents have become chaotic and dissonant. Energy is wasted on internal conflict, destroying social capital and burning the society out from within.

*   **Civic Atrophy (Coherence Erosion):** The "fraying of the thread" as the social fabric decays.
    *   **Symptoms:** The slow decay of public infrastructure, erosion of institutional legitimacy, loss of shared cultural identity, cultural amnesia, increasing social isolation.
    *   **Diagnosis:** The society's Wound Channel—its collective memory and identity—is failing to hold its pattern against entropy. The society is forgetting how to be itself.
