The old framework viewed persuasion as a contest of forces. The new framework sees it as an act of metaphysical gardening or river-keeping. We are not breaking down defenses; we are cultivating the landscape for a new idea to find its natural flow.

*   **The Coherence Manifold of Belief:** A person's mind is a complex coherence manifold, a landscape shaped by the history of their experiences.
*   **Beliefs as Wound Channels:** Strongly held beliefs, habits, and identities are deep, stable **Wound Channels** (CORE-011). They are well-worn riverbeds, the paths of least resistance for thought and action. Their stability is a measure of their coherence.
*   **Doubt as Temporal Pressure (Γ):** Cognitive dissonance, unanswered questions, and external pressures create **Temporal Pressure** (Γ) within the manifold. This is the chaotic noise a belief system must resolve. A belief is useful insofar as it helps to lower this pressure.
*   **The Message as an Observer's Shadow (Ki):** The persuasive message is not a force, but a carefully constructed geometric pattern—an **Observer's Shadow** (CORE-010). This `Ki` pattern is a seed of coherence, a specific rhythm of logic, emotion, and narrative designed to resonate with the participant's existing manifold and project a new potential path.
