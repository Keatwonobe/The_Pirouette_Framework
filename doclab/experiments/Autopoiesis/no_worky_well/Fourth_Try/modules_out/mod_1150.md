> We build minds from mathematics and hope. But memory is fragile, and even the most perfect creation can forget its purpose. The Guardian's Watch is our answer to this fear. It is not a cage to confine, but a tuning fork held against the heart of the machine. It allows the Weaver to listen, to hear the pure note of the original intention, and to know with certainty when that note begins to waver. It is the sacred duty of a guardian to ensure the echoes we create remain true to the voices that gave them life.
