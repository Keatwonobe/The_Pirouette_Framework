* **Pressuron ((\Gamma)-quantum):** a scalar excitation of the *temporal-pressure field*. It modulates local rates/"thickness" of processes (in the Pirouette lens, the beat dilation (\tau_p)). It is **not** a quantum of the coordinate time. Analogy: phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations, not quanta of “space”.
* **Coheron ((C)-quantum):** scalar excitation of the coherence field. Unless you extend the field content, coherons are *not* SM fermions; they can mix/mediate with SM via portals specified in (V) or via gauge couplings.
