1. **Rigidity drives curvature:** In this dataset Γ≈μ; increasing μ steepens both the potential and the variance (σ).
2. **Prescriptive vs. contemplative dialectic:** Legal/strategic prose reliably maps to the Velcrid quadrant (high Γ, mid-to-high σ); texts centred on personal reflection cluster toward low Γ, low σ → candidate heuristic for quick triage.
3. **Saturation artefact:** After \~4 k flips with constant 0.1 amplitude the grid’s mean field saturates, artificially compressing σ.  Mitigation: scale amplitude ∝ 1/√flips or re-centre the grid after N frames.
4. **Stability window:** μ, σ converge well (<2 % drift) after ≈ 2048 flips for all 10 long-form texts, giving a pragmatic “safe sampling budget”.
