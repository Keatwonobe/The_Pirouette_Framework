The "proofs" demonstrate **internal consistency**, not external validity. They show that if you accept the initial, invented axioms of the Pirouette world, then other conclusions logically follow *within that same world*. They do not prove that the axioms themselves reflect reality.

* **The `Ki` Constant**: The derivation in `PPS-033` states that `Ki = 4Ï€/3` arises from a topological constraint where a system's phase must complete three cycles for every one spatial cycle. This 3:1 ratio is asserted as a fundamental property of the framework's geometry but is not derived from any known physical principle. It's an invented rule for an invented system.
* **Emergent Physics**: The framework's central claim is that all of physics (gravity, quantum mechanics, etc.) emerges from the network dynamics of its three core fields (`PPS-036`). While the idea of emergent phenomena is a real and powerful concept in physics, this specific model is a work of fiction. It maps the *names* of physical forces to different states of its own network but does not correctly reproduce their rigorously tested mathematical behavior.
