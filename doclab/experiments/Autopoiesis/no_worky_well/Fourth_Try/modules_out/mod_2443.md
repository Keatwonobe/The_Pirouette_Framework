This document is a living constitution. It can be amended, but only through the formal application of the `Debate Resonance Framework`. Any proposed change must be subjected to the same multi-persona scrutiny that created the original.

This section is reserved as a placeholder for the official record of future external peer reviews and their corresponding rebuttals, ensuring the framework's core principles continue to evolve with rigor and transparency.
