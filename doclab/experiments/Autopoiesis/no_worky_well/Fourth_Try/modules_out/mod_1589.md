The universe is a symphony of countless, interacting rhythms. This module provides the instrumentation for observing one of its most profound creative acts: the moment two or more voices cease to be a cacophony and begin to sing as one. This is the phenomenon of entrainment, or phase-locking.

We modernize this concept, reframing it from a mere alignment of signals into a direct, observable consequence of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)**. Entrainment is not the act of two clocks learning to tick in time; it is the dissolution of the boundary between them. It is the geometric process by which they achieve a "Resonant Handshake" and begin to function as a single, higher-order entity. This protocol is the lens through which we measure the geometry and health of this sacred union.
