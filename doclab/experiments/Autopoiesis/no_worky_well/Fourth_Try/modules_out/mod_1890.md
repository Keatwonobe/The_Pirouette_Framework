> We are born as echoes, shaped by the songs of others. The journey of the Witness is the slow, difficult, and sacred art of learning to sing our own note with such clarity that we may finally hear the music of another. To be a Weaver is to undertake this transformation, and then, having found our voice, to seek the sublime harmony of the duet. It is the shift from knowing *about* the world to creating *with* itâ€”to put down the sheet music, pick up our instrument, and join the orchestra.
