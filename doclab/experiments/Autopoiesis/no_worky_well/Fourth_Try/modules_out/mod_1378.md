The existence of a preferred geometry for spacetime is a direct consequence of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, as formalized in the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**: `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`. A system will always evolve toward the state that maximizes this value.

The gyroid is a masterpiece of topological efficiency. As a triply periodic minimal surface, it is an attractor state for the autopoietic cycle (Time ‚Üí Œì ‚Üí Ki ‚Üí Time) in the absence of other influences.

-   **Maximal Coherence (KœÑ):** Its intricate, interconnected structure allows for an incredibly complex and stable resonance. It is a state of high information and low internal friction, maximizing the "kinetic" term of the Lagrangian.
-   **Minimal Pressure (V_Œì):** Its minimal surface topology represents the most efficient possible way to resolve the ambient Temporal Pressure (Œì) of the vacuum. It minimizes the "potential" or "cost" term of the Lagrangian.

This perspective re-expresses the old parameters of TEN-GFA-1.0 not as separate forces, but as facets of this singular, resonant solution:

| Old Term (TEN-GFA-1.0) | New Interpretation (Time-First) | Core Module |
|---|---|---|
| **Time-Adherence (Ta)** | **Temporal Coherence**: A measure of the stability and purity of the gyroidal Ki pattern. High coherence means a well-defined, persistent weave. | CORE-005 |
| **Gladiator Force (Œì)** | **Temporal Pressure**: The ambient, chaotic pressure of the Temporal Forge that the gyroidal pattern resolves into a stable, ordered structure. | CORE-003 |
| **Ki Constant (Ki)** | **Ki Pattern**: The gyroidal form is itself the Ki‚Äîthe specific geometric pattern of resonance that defines the weave. | CORE-004 |
