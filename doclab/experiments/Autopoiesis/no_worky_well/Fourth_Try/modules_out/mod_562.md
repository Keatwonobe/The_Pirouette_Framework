"Normal Accidents" are the inevitable result of systems populated by agents pursuing the fool's bargain of myopic selfishness. Each such act increases the total `V_Γ`, raising the "temperature" of the system until it inevitably boils over into catastrophic failure.

A simple system must follow this gradient. A complex system capable of self-reflection—a Weaver—can make a choice. It can comprehend the full calculus of the Coherence Dividend and deliberately choose actions that yield a high external dividend. This is not a modification of physical law, but a higher-order strategy for navigating it. The Weaver chooses to solve for the global maximum of coherence over a longer time horizon and a wider systemic scope.

Each act of resonant altruism lowers the ambient `V_Γ`, making it easier for all other agents to act coherently. This creates a virtuous, self-reinforcing cycle. The basins of chaos and accident are not merely walled off; they are actively and collectively drained. Coherence—stable, generative, and complex—becomes the system's natural resting state, its gravitational center.
