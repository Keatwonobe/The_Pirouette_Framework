This entire module serves as the primary validation for the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = T_a * ω_k - f(Γ)`), introduced in CORE-006. Each derived phenomenon is a direct consequence of systems following the Principle of Maximal Coherence.
*   **Electromagnetism** is the result of navigating the gradients (E) and curls (B) in `𝓛_p`.
*   **Confinement** arises from non-linear, scale-dependent feedback within the `f(Γ)` term of `𝓛_p`.
*   **Spin and the g-factor** are consequences of the topological stability constraints on the `T_a * ω_k` term of `𝓛_p`, with the anomaly emerging from its self-interaction.

The apparent diversity of physical law is shown to be the multifaceted expression of a single, unified dynamic equation.
