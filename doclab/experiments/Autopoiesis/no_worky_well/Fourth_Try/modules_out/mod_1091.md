The original module correctly identified the wave's lifecycle as a model for coherence over time. This process does not end with a single wave.

1.  **Genesis:** The primary wave emerges, a single, large-scale Ki pattern. This state has high coherence.
2.  **Maturity:** The wave grows in amplitude, efficiently mediating the temporal shear.
3.  **Cascade:** Eventually, the wave breaks. Its singular coherence dissolves, not into nothingness, but into a fractal cascade of smaller, self-similar vortices and eddies.

This cascade is a critical dynamic. It demonstrates how a single, large-scale coherent structure can act as a parent to a whole spectrum of smaller, more complex patterns. The coherence of the first wave is not lost; it is reinvested, seeding complexity at finer and finer scales. This is a primary engine for the universe's fractal nature.
