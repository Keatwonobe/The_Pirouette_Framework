Every narrative, from a single thought to a global ideology, exists upon a coherence manifold. This is the landscape where the potential for meaning resides. A powerful, coherent concept acts precisely like a massive object in spacetime, as described in The Gladiator Force (CORE-008). It locally increases Temporal Pressure (Î“), wrapping itself in a deep "coherence well."

The act of thinking or communicating is the act of tracing a path across this manifold. The "gravity of meaning" is the observable tendency for our thoughts and words to fall into the deepest, most stable coherence wells available. We do not choose our core beliefs so much as we find our thoughts naturally orbiting them.
