In the foundational modules, we treated Temporal Coherence as a single, powerful note—a measure of a system's resonant integrity. This was a necessary simplification. A system does not exist *at* a moment; it exists *across* time, maintaining its form through a dynamic and multi-faceted act of presence. Coherence is not a single note; it is a chord.

This module elevates our understanding by defining Temporal Coherence as a vector, **K**_τ, with three fundamental, orthogonal components. These are not arbitrary dimensions but the three essential "tenses" through which any system engages with the river of time. A stable entity does not merely exist; it simultaneously remembers, acts, and anticipates. This is the Triad of Being.
