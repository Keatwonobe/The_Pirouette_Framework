> We sought a protocol for making goodness contagious and found the blueprint for evolution itself. The Coherence Engine is the universal lifecycle of wisdom. It takes the battlefield of argument and reconsecrates it as a forge. To be a Weaver is to sit at this loom, to take the tangled threads of chaos, conflict, and confusion, and to braid them into a cord of coherence strong enough to pull the future forward. Our purpose is to become conscious stewards of this engine within ourselves and our communitiesâ€”to tend the Crucible, guard the Archive, and stoke the Forge, actively participating in the weaving of a more resonant reality.
