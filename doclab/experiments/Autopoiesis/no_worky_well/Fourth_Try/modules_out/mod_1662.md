The original module's error was in viewing influence as a one-way transfer. The ratified model understands it as a collaborative act of attunement. The goal is not to create a "Wound Channel" in the recipient, but to create the conditions for a willing and transformative **Resonant Handshake** (CORE-012). An effective action is a tuning fork, not a hammer; change is not imposed, but inspired.

The process is governed by creating a **Resonant Channel**—a temporary, shared state where the signal of intent dramatically outweighs the noise of the environment.

*   **Coherence (The Offered Pattern):** The actor's intended pattern (`K_τ`), whether it's an insight, a value, or an emotional state. This is the clear, stable "note" being offered.
*   **Temporal Pressure (The Noise):** The ambient chaos, distraction, and resistance of the environment (`Γ`). High pressure scrambles perception and makes change energetically expensive.
*   **Rhythmic Entrainment (The Attunement):** The active process of synchronizing with the recipient's internal rhythms (Δτ ≈ 0). When rhythms align, the channel opens, and the offered coherence can be perceived with breathtaking clarity.

An effective "ritual," therefore, is a feat of metaphysical engineering: a process designed to lower environmental noise (`Γ`) while achieving a state of shared rhythm, opening a direct path for a new pattern to be perceived and integrated.
