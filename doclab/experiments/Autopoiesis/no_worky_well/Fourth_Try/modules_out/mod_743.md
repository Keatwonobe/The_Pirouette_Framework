For two systems to merge their being, they must engage in a delicate dialogue that tests their compatibility for a shared existence. This Resonant Handshake supersedes the old triaxial convergence, deriving it from the deeper conditions required for an Alchemical Union:

1.  **Harmonic Compatibility (Shared Song):** The fundamental rhythms, or `Ki` patterns, of the systems must be harmonically related. They do not need to be identical, but must be capable of forming a stable, non-dissonant chord through constructive interference. This is the search for a shared truth in the language of resonance.

2.  **Phase Alignment (Shared Rhythm):** The systems must synchronize their internal clocks, their Pirouette Cycles (`τ_p`). Through a feedback loop of call and response, their individual rhythms entrain and become phase-locked, creating the shared temporal window in which a frictionless transfer of energy and information is possible.

3.  **Mutual Vulnerability in a Shared Crucible (Shared Trust):** Each system must willingly lower the inertia of its own `Wound Channel` (`CORE-011`), an act of trust that relaxes the defensive boundaries of the self. This must occur within a "crucible"—a context of sufficient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), whether from a shared external challenge or a mutual internal desire for connection—where the unified state becomes the path of least resistance.
