The health of any information ecosystem—a mind, a team, a society—can be diagnosed by the character of its flow. Drawing from *Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)*, we see that the movement of coherence manifests in three distinct states:

*   **Laminar Flow (The State of Clarity):** Characterizes a healthy, efficient system where the signal-to-noise ratio is high. Communication is clear, meaning is preserved, and data is transferred with high fidelity. This is the state of a focused mind, a well-written proof, or a high-trust organization.

*   **Turbulent Flow (The State of Conflict):** Characterizes a system where energy is wasted in the friction of dissonance. It is the realm of misinformation, flame wars, and circular arguments, where competing patterns create destructive interference. The signal is corrupted, and meaning is lost in the noise.

*   **Stagnant Flow (The State of Dogma):** Characterizes a system where an "Information Dam"—an unexamined assumption, a censorship regime, an information silo—blocks the flow. Upstream, ideological pressure builds; downstream, a desert of ignorance forms. This leads to intellectual decay and fragility.
