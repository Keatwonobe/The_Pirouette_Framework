A theory's elegance is meaningless without proof. The engine's final and most crucial test is to derive the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2)—the most precise prediction in physics—from these same first principles.

Spin as Topology: In this framework, spin is not an intrinsic property but an emergent, topological feature of a particle's resonance. An electron is a stable, two-cycle "knot" in the coherence field with the topology of a Möbius strip; it must rotate 720° to return to its starting state. This two-cycle nature is the geometric origin of its baseline g-factor of g=2.

The Anomaly as an Echo: The tiny deviation from g=2 is caused by the electron's resonance interacting with the "wake" or "echo" of its own immediate past in the coherence manifold. The predicted value of this anomaly (a_e) is simply the product of the interaction's intrinsic strength (the fine-structure constant, α) and the geometry of a single echo cycle (1/2π).

a_e = (g-2)/2 = α/2π ≈ 0.0011614

This heuristic prediction matches the experimental value (~0.001159652) to within 0.15%, confirming the foundational soundness of the entire engine and demanding a more formal mathematical proof.
