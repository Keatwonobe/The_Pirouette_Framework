A "boundary" or "shell" is not a static wall; it is a dynamic conversation. We define a system's edge—be it a cell membrane, a plasma's turbulent boundary, or the perimeter of a belief system—as a **Coherence Interface**. This is a temporal boundary, a region in the coherence manifold where the system's internal Ki pattern undergoes a rapid transition, creating a steep gradient of Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is where the system actively negotiates its existence with the universe.

The properties of this interface determine the system's relationship with its environment:

*   **Permeability:** An interface with low temporal coherence is "porous." It is easily disrupted by external noise and susceptible to being drawn into the turbulent flow of its surroundings.
*   **Resilience:** An interface with high temporal coherence acts as a "resonant drumhead." It maintains its own stable rhythm, reflecting most dissonant signals and preserving the system's internal integrity.
