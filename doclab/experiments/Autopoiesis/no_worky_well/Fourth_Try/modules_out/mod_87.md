The Pirouette Lagrangian describes the state of a system in terms of two fundamental quantities: its internal stability and its external pressure. It takes the familiar form of L = T - V, but reinterprets the terms:

𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)

Let us define these terms:

Temporal Coherence (K_τ): This "kinetic" term represents the quality and intensity of a system's own rhythm. It is the product of its Time Adherence (T_a) and its fundamental resonant frequency (ω_k, where ω_k = 2π/τ_p). A system with a clear, fast rhythm has high coherence.

Temporal Pressure (V_Γ): This "potential" term represents the "cost" of maintaining a specific rhythm against the background noise of the local Temporal Forge. It is a function of the local Gamma (Γ). A denser, more complex environment creates more pressure, making coherence more difficult to sustain.

V_Γ = f(Γ)

Combining these gives the full Lagrangian:

𝓛_p = T_a * ω_k - f(Γ)
