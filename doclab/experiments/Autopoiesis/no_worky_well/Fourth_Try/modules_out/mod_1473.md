The resistance a system shows to a change in its state of motion—inertia—is a direct consequence of its history, as encoded in its Wound Channel (CORE-011).

A system at rest has, over time, carved a deep and stable "well" for itself in the coherence manifold. This geometric indentation acts as a **Coherence Dam**: a potential well that creates a powerful inertia. To initiate motion, the system must be supplied with enough energy to "climb out" of this self-made well and begin carving a new, dynamic channel. This required energy is the physical basis for **activation energy**. It is the price of forgetting stillness and learning motion, manifesting as the initial "kick" of resistance.
