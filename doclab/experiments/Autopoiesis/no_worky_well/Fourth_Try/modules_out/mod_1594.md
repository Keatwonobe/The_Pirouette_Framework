The protocol translates raw signals into a diagnosis of resonant coupling through a clear, four-step process.

1.  **Isolate the Rhythm:** For each input time series `xᵢ(t)`, apply the chosen `ExtractionMethod` to extract its core Ki pattern, represented as an instantaneous phase `θᵢ(t)` and frequency `ωᵢ(t)`.

2.  **Map the Relational Geometry:** For all pairs of systems `(i, j)` and for all specified `HarmonicRatios` (n:m), calculate the generalized relative phase: `Δθᵢⱼⁿᵐ(t)`. This time series represents the evolving geometric relationship between the two rhythms.

3.  **Diagnose the Flow State:** Within each `AnalysisWindow`, analyze the stability of `Δθᵢⱼⁿᵐ(t)`. The character of this time series is a direct diagnosis of the health of the connection:
    *   **Laminar (Entrained):** `Δθ(t)` is stable and bounded within a narrow range. The systems have achieved a resonant handshake and are flowing as one.
    *   **Turbulent (Dissonant):** `Δθ(t)` is chaotic and unpredictable. The systems are in conflict, wasting energy in friction.
    *   **Stagnant (Drifting):** `Δθ(t)` is slowly but consistently changing. The systems are uncoupled or in the process of losing their connection.

4.  **Assess the Chorus:** For ensembles of three or more systems, calculate the overall Ensemble Coherence (`Kτ_ensemble`). A value approaching 1 signifies powerful global synchrony, indicating the formation of a collective, higher-order resonant entity.
