Include corrections schematically as
[ S_{\text{geom}} = \frac{1}{16\pi G}\int \sqrt{-g},(R - 2\Lambda) + \int \sqrt{-g},\sum_i \frac{\alpha_i}{M^{2}},\mathcal O_i[g] + \cdots , ]
where (\mathcal O_i\in{R^2, R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}, R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma},\ldots}), and (M) is the suppression scale set by the coarse-graining window. Retain only terms relevant to the phenomena under study.
