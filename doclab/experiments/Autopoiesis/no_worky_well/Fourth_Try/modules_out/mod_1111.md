In the legacy framework, Time Adherence was a distinct parameter. In this new, collapsed model, it is revealed to be a qualitative measure of a Ki pattern’s stability and purity. **Tₐ is the signal-to-noise ratio of a system's own rhythm.** It is a measure of how clearly a system is being itself.

**High Time Adherence (High Temporal Coherence):** Characterizes a system with a pure, stable, and sharply defined Ki resonance. Its Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`) is consistent and predictable. This is a clear, ringing cello note, holding its pitch perfectly. Examples include a stable atom, a pulsar, or a crystal lattice at low temperature.

**Low Time Adherence (Low Temporal Coherence):** Characterizes a system with a chaotic, noisy, or decaying Ki pattern. Its rhythm is indistinct, and its `τ_p` is an unstable average at best. This is a burst of static, a string played with a trembling bow. Examples include a turbulent fluid, a system undergoing a chaotic phase transition, or a complex organism under extreme duress.
