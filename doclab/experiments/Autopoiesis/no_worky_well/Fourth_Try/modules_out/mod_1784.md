To map a system's Atlas of States, the Weaver follows a clear, four-step protocol:

1.  **Identify the Repertoire:** Using analytical techniques (e.g., spectral analysis, clustering), parse the system's data to identify the distinct, recurring `Ki` patterns. This reveals the system's set of songs.
2.  **Measure Coherence Height:** For each identified mode, quantify its internal efficiency and stability (`𝓛_p,m`). This measures the "quality" of each state.
3.  **Gauge Stability & Inertia:** For each mode, measure its resistance to perturbation to determine its `Stability Depth (Δ𝓛_p)`. Analyze its persistence over time to estimate the contribution of its `Wound Channel Inertia`. This reveals how "sticky" or habitual each state is.
4.  **Map the Pathways:** Analyze historical transition events. What specific pressure shifts or resonant injections trigger phase leaps between states? This maps the "saddles" and "passes" between the peaks, revealing the system's likely responses to future challenges.
