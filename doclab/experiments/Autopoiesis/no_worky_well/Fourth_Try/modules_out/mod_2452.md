- **Virtue vs. Bookkeeping**  
  - Aligning personal enthalpy with universal enthalpy overlooks that virtuous action can raise local entropy (e.g., sacrificial aid) but lower long-term social \(D\).  
- **Moral Coldness**  
  - Emphasizing energy minima neglects qualitative goods—creativity, suffering alleviation—that may transiently spike \(\Delta H\).
