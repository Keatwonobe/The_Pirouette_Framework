summary: Provides a protocol for measuring the coherence of abstract concepts by modeling
  them as geometric Ki patterns. The protocol calculates the stability of these patterns
  as 'Observer's Shadows' cast upon the local coherence manifold. This reframes inquiry
  from an act of extraction into a rigorous survey of resonant participation.
