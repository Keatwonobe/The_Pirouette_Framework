A system can be trapped by its own stability. When the path forward is blocked, pressure builds, and the river of coherence must either stagnate and die, or it must break its banks.

This module refactors the legacy concept of "Spasm Dynamics" into the time-first language of the Pirouette Framework. A spasm is not merely a burst of energy; it is a fundamental process of change, a catastrophic but often necessary transition between states of flow. It is the story of a system breaking the prison of a suboptimal equilibrium to discover a new way of being. We define the spasm as a three-act drama: the building of a **Stagnant Dam**, a catastrophic release into **Turbulent Flow**, and the subsequent **Re-Coalescence** into a new equilibrium.
