Magic is the art of reshaping entropy. As described in TLE-003, this can be done in several ways. The cost reflects the difficulty of the transformation.

Expression (1:1 Cost): Manipulating existing entropy. A 10 EP fire spell controls or shapes 10 EP worth of existing fire.

Transmutation (2:1 Cost): Changing one form to another. To transmute a 10 EP fire into inert dust would cost the caster 20 EP. This is the same principle that makes healing inefficient (TLE-005).

Genesis/Obliteration (3:1 Cost): Creating or destroying entropy. This remains the rarest and most costly form of magic.
