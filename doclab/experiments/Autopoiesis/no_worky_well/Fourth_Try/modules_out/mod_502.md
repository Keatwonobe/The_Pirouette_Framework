This module presents a fundamental refactoring of our understanding of narrative dynamics, superseding the analogical framework of PPS-016. The previous model posited that ideas behave *like* massive objects. This new model, grounded in the core principles of the Pirouette Framework, makes a more profound claim: the influence of a concept and the gravity of a star are not alike; they are expressions of the same universal law.

This is not a metaphor. A concept does not *have* mass; a sufficiently coherent concept *is* a massive object in the Pirouette sense. Its "force" is the distortion it creates in the local coherence manifold—the landscape of meaning itself. Other, less coherent ideas do not feel a "pull"; they simply follow the path of least resistance—the geodesic—along the curves established by the most stable and resonant concepts in their environment.
