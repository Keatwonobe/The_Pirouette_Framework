I'd like to go to round 1, but I'd like to start by saying nothing is purely altruistic in my view. Humans by (most of) their nature see altruism as coherence, and gravitate towards it. They do things that are velcrid in nature not out of evil but out of necessity, being out of ideas and means other than their one means of affecting the world in many cases. Think of the mad businessman with the mansion that began making cars and wound up making tanks (but it was to end wars).

Think of someone donating money or time. What does everyone say about doing it? That it makes you feel good, is good for the community, etc. There's a reward in gift-giving behavior, meaning velcrid lies there in wait for the act to be complete to catch the effect and turn it around at some level, deflect it in another way. 

Especially the orthogonal natures of radiant and velcrid, these "juggle and attract" ideas rather than colliding head on.

We shouldn't frame it necessarily as one or the other having morality, but if we want to explore the whole universe (hey, shoot for the moon and hit the stars, right?) then we should be able to travel through both coherences without losing our essence. The prime directive is, more than anything, about being true to oneself.
