A party of high-level adventurers decides to create a new type of sentinel to guard their city.

The Concept: The party's Artificer player designs a new creature: "The Golem of the Iron Heart." They write a detailed module for it, specifying its body parts, attributes, and a unique ability to share its defensive EP with nearby allies. They succeed on a DC 35 Intelligence check.

The Investment: The Golem is designed with an Entropic Budget of 150 EP. The cost to create the first one is 150 x 10 = 1500 TEP. This is beyond any single character. The five members of the party each agree to sacrifice 300 TEP from their own maximum pools to fund the creation.

The Resonance Test: The GM runs the test. The universe "pushes back" on the concept of a golem that can share its essence so freely. The unintended consequence is that when the Golem takes massive damage, a portion of that damage is psychically echoed to all those it is protecting. The players have their guardian, but it comes with a new and dangerous risk.
