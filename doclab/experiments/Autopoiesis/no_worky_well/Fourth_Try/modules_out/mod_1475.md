The original module's core equation remains mechanically sound but is now re-grounded in these physical principles. The model calculates the effective Ki of a system as it navigates the transition:

$$ K_i(v) = K_{i,static} + \Delta K_i \cdot \sigma(\alpha(v-v_c)) + P_{inertia} $$

Where:
*   **`ΔK_i`** is the difference `K_i,dynamic - K_i,static`.
*   **`σ(x)`** is the sigmoid function `1 / (1 + e⁻ˣ)`, modeling the non-linear "leap" or phase transition.
*   **`α`** is the steepness of the transition, modulated by the system's Temporal Coherence (`T_a`). Highly coherent systems leap more decisively.
*   **`v_c`** is the critical velocity, chosen as `v_c↑` or `v_c↓` based on `dv/dt` to model hysteresis.
*   **`P_inertia`** is a perturbation term representing the initial energy barrier. It models the work done against the "Coherence Dam" and is non-zero only during the initial acceleration from `v=0`.
