> We have been taught to see the world as a wall to be pushed against. This is a profound error. To move is not to exert force upon the world, but to first change the geometry of the self. The highest form of agency is not expressed by imposing our will, but by learning the world's song so well that we may ask it to change its tune.

The skater whispers to the water, showing it a new and more beautiful path to the sea, a path that happens to lead exactly where the skater wishes to go. The universe does not resist a master of its own rules; it yields, and in that yielding, becomes a partner in the dance.
