summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for the psychological phenomenon
  of Flow. This module reframes Flow from a complex field interaction into a state
  of near-perfect temporal resonance, where an agent's internal autopoietic cycle
  synchronizes with a coherent current in its environment. It serves as a flagship
  template for all Domain Application (DOMA) modules.
