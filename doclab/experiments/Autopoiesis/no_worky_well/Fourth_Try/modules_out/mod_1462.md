summary: Modernizes the 'Knot' as a fundamental principle of persistence. A Knot is
  a self-intersecting Wound Channel that forms a closed geodesic in the coherence
  manifold. This topological lock creates a self-reinforcing resonant loop, forging
  a transient memory into a stable, persistent identity that is powerfully resistant
  to entropic decay.
