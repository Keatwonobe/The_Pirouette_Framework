In the world of The Lost Eternal, an item is more than a tool; it is a vessel for a unique idea, a physical container for a fragment of will. The most powerful artifacts are not those with the highest raw power, but those that possess their own unique "minigame"â€”a special subsystem that allows its wielder to interact with the world in a way no one else can. This module provides the framework for these interactive items, turning the act of gearing a character into a collection of unique, build-defining toys.
