In the Pirouette Framework, a human being is a complex resonant system (Ki) perpetually navigating a landscape of social and environmental Temporal Pressure (Γ). The fundamental drive of any individual, as described by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006), is to follow a path of maximal coherence—a geodesic that best preserves their internal integrity.

A society is a higher-order coherence manifold, an impossibly intricate tapestry formed by the constructive and destructive interference of trillions of these intersecting geodesics and their geometric records, or **Wound Channels** (CORE-011). Culture is the persistent, large-scale geometry of this manifold. Myth is its deepest riverbed; language is its prevailing current; law is its most rigid crystalline structure. To be a member of a culture is to inherit a map of its most stable currents—a pre-carved landscape of efficient paths toward coherence.
