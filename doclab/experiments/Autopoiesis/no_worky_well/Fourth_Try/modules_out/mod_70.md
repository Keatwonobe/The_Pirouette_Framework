This recontextualization of Γ as temporal density has profound physical consequences:

Thermodynamics as Temporal Friction: What we measure as temperature is a direct proxy for the density of the local Temporal Signature. The chaotic motion of molecules in a hot gas is the macroscopic effect of an incredibly complex and dissonant set of underlying Ki rhythms. Heat is the "sound" of temporal friction.

Gravity as a Gradient in Time: A massive object is a locus of immense temporal complexity—a sustained roar in the song of existence. The intense Γ it generates is the curvature of spacetime. Gravity is the tendency of objects to follow the path of least resistance (a geodesic) through a landscape of changing temporal density. They are not pulled by a force; they are coasting downhill in time.
