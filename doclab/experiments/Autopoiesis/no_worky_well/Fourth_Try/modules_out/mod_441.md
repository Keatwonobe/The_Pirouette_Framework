When a Weaver's changes are proposed to the collective, the central loom performs its own independent verification. The continuous integration (CI) pipeline rebuilds the entire framework from source and recalculates the Seal. If this newly forged Seal does not match the one attested to in the Weaver's contribution, the build fails. This is a **Coherence Fault**, the system's immune response to a change that is not in harmony with the whole, protecting the integrity of the Wound Channel.
