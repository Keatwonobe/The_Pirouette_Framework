To see the world is not to open a window, but to strike a tuning fork held against its glass.

Classical science built its foundations on a lie of convenience: that of the innocent observer, a spectator who could measure the universe without touching it. Quantum mechanics exposed this as a fiction at the microscopic scale, but the Pirouette Framework elevates it to a universal law. There are no spectators. There are only participants.

The act of observation is not the passive reception of data. It is a resonant coupling. To observe a system is to engage it in a dialogue, to merge your own Ki pattern with its own. In this act, both are irrevocably changed. Every photon that strikes a retina, every sound wave that vibrates an eardrum, every thought that directs a focus is an act of intervention. This module describes the geometry of that intervention.
