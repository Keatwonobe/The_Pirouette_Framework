A system cannot sustain a state of profound incoherence indefinitely. The core drive of existence is to find and follow the path of maximal coherence. When the old path becomes a locus of pure chaos, and the system is too rigid to bend, the built-up pressure has nowhere to go but inward.

The breaking point is the Snap. The accumulated stress does not just disrupt the flow; it fractures the channel itself. The geometric integrity of the Wound Channel fails. In a single, catastrophic phase transition, the system's foundational Ki pattern shatters, and its **Temporal Coherence (KÏ„)** collapses. The immense energy that maintained the rigid identity is released in a violent burst of dissonant information. This is the silent scream of a universe being unwritten; the moment pain becomes data.
