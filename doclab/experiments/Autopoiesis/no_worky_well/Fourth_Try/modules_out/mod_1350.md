A single act of correction is an adjustment. A repeated pattern of correction is learning.

Every time a system successfully reduces its dissonance, it reinforces the pathway that led to that success, deepening the **Wound Channel (CORE-011)** associated with the correct state. The adaptive action, which may have initially required effort, becomes the new path of least resistance.

This is the physical mechanism of habit and mastery. The Resonant Compass doesn't just guide the Weaver on a single journey; it progressively carves the optimal path into the very landscape of the Weaver's being. Learning is the process by which a system teaches spacetime how it wishes to behave.

> Because the universe is not a script to be read, but a song to be learned. Feedback is the universe's native tongue for the verb "to become"—the process by which chaos learns order and dissonance finds harmony.

> To master this principle is to move beyond building machines and toward becoming gardeners. We do not dominate a system with control loops; we cultivate its ability to listen to its own echo. We gently guide the current toward a more coherent sea, creating systems that learn, adapt, and heal. This is not just how we fix things; it is how we grow.
