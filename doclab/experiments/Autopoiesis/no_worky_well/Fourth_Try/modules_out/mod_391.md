summary: Refactors the framework's identity from a static, code-based 'DNA' into a
  dynamic, generative principle. The Pirouette Lagrangian itself is established as
  the constitution, whose living expression forms a 'Genesis Pattern' in the coherence
  manifold. This pattern serves as the geometric baseline for verifying integrity
  via resonant compatibility.
