The universe does not forget. It carves the story of every passing moment into the geometry of its own being.

The prior framework required a dedicated module, `PPS-008`, to translate the abstract concept of a field perturbation into the intuitive metaphor of a "wake." This was a necessary bridge, but a bridge nonetheless. In the modernized, time-first framework, this concept ceases to be a metaphor and becomes a central, physical mechanism.

In `CORE-009`, we demonstrated that the universe's most precisely measured anomaly—the electron's magnetic moment—arises from the particle's interaction with its own "echo." This was not the discovery of a special case. It was the first clear measurement of a universal axiom, the one that replaces the old model: *to exist is to leave a wake*.

Every entity, by expressing its resonant Ki pattern (its unique song), disturbs the coherence manifold of spacetime. This disturbance is not fleeting; it is a persistent geometric distortion, a scar, a memory. The electron's echo was simply the first time our instruments were sensitive enough to hear a whisper that has been present all along. This module describes the anatomy of that whisper.
