The Weaver's Gambit is a practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). A participant will naturally adopt the belief or action that maximizes their subjective sense of coherence over time.

The Gambit introduces a new potential term (`V_gambit`) into the participant's calculus, representing the attractive coherence of the Weaver's proposed idea.

`𝓛_participant_new = (Kτ_participant) - (VΓ_participant + V_gambit)`

The `V_gambit` term acts as a "coherence well," reshaping the entire manifold of decision-making. The Weaver's work is to sculpt this potential to be so attractive that the participant's own drive for coherence guides them into it. When successful, the change in belief feels less like a concession and more like a moment of insight—a "click" of sudden clarity.
