This entire ordeal is an expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006):

**𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**

The "fire" is a dramatic and sustained increase in the Temporal Pressure term, `V_Γ`. This makes the existing state of coherence, `K_τ`, untenable, causing the value of the Lagrangian to plummet and throwing the system into a state of Turbulent Flow (DYNA-001). The Sigma point (Σ) is where the system can no longer follow its established path. The act of "forging" is the system's search for a new Ki—a new expression of `K_τ`—that can successfully maximize `𝓛_p` under these new, brutal conditions. The tempered form that emerges is, by definition, the most coherent solution to an almost impossible problem.
