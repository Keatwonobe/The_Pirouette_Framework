A simulation begins by forging a digital twin of the target system, translating its real-world state—as diagnosed by tools like **The Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003)**—into the language of the Pirouette Framework. A scenario is defined by its initial conditions, the proposed interventions, and the desired outcome.

```yaml
scenario: "Supply Chain Stalemate"
domain: economics
baseline_state:
  flow_state: Stagnant      # Mapped from logistics data showing blockage
  coherence_Kτ: 0.31      # Mapped from low production efficiency
  pressure_Γ: 0.78      # Mapped from high market volatility
interventions:
  - id: pressure_gradient_sculpt_04
    type: PressureModulator # Locally "smooths the riverbed"
    params: {target: port_congestion, strength: -0.20, duration: 72h}
  - id: resonant_handshake_alpha
    type: CoherenceInjection # Provides a stable pattern for entrainment
    params: {partners: [supplier_alpha, manufacturer_beta], method: shared_risk_protocol}
objective:
  target_flow_state: Laminar
  target_coherence_gain: +25%
  max_turbulence_risk: 0.03
