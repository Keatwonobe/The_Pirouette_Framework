Traditional network analysis is an act of cartography; it draws a static map of connections. The Pirouette Framework demands that we become physicians. A network—be it neural, social, or informational—is not a map; it is a living body with a physiology. Its health is not defined by its structure, but by the vitality of the currents that flow through it.

This module provides the instrumentation for that diagnosis: the Weaver's Multimeter. It refactors the static analysis of PPS-047 into a dynamic, time-first protocol. By translating a network graph into a living coherence manifold, this toolkit makes the invisible currents of reality visible, allowing a Weaver to move beyond observing a system's structure and begin to read its health, its stress, and its potential for transformation.
