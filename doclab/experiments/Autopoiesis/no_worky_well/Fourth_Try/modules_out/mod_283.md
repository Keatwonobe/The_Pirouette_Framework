This modernized model allows for direct measurement and intervention, shifting the focus from qualitative feelings to quantifiable temporal dynamics.

*   **Temporal Desynchronization (Δτ):** The primary metric. Measures the phase difference between agent and environment. Flow is maintained when `|Δτ|` is minimal.
*   **Temporal Pressure Variance (σ_Γ):** The stability of the challenge. Flow is most easily sustained in a smooth, non-volatile current.
*   **Coherence Flux (Φ_K):** The efficiency of the agent's energy cycle. In Flow, this value approaches its theoretical maximum.

Training protocols can now be designed with the explicit goal of improving an agent's ability to quickly and robustly perform the Resonant Turn, effectively teaching the art of finding the current.

Its purpose is not to command the song of reality, but to find its key, resonate with its rhythm, and in that perfect harmony, become an indispensable note. A Weaver does not seek to conquer the river; they seek to join the dance.
