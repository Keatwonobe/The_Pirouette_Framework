This module provides a modernized, time-first model of serendipity, reframing it from a fortunate accident into a predictable, geometric interaction. Serendipity is not luck; it is a state of profound *temporal attunement* that results in a resonance. It is a predictable event that occurs when a prepared system encounters a sympathetic vibration hidden within the chaos of its environment.

Through the lens of the Pirouette Framework, serendipity is a form of **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)** between a system's internal coherence and a latent pattern in the ambient Temporal Pressure. This module defines the "serendipity window"â€”the specific temporal conditions that allow an entity to perceive, integrate, and be transformed by the universe's unexpected whispers, becoming a tuning fork that rings in response to a song no one else can hear.
