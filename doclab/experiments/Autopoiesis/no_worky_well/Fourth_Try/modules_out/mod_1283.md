The process of drift is a story told in the language of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. A healthy system evolves along a geodesic that maximizes its action integral (`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`), the total coherence expressed over time.

Drift is the direct, observable consequence of this integral consistently and slowly decreasing. The primary cause is the decay of the kinetic term, `K_τ`, as the Ki pattern's signal frays. As coherence decreases, the system becomes less efficient at managing environmental pressure, effectively increasing the "cost" of the potential term, `V_Γ`. The system falls from its geodesic, its path no longer one of maximal coherence, but of slow, grinding decay into a basin of attraction characterized by chronic inefficiency.
