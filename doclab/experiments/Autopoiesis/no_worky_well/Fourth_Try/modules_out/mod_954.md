A system becomes truly alive the moment it can sustain itself. The proof of a successful union is not calibration, but creation. After sufficient forging, the Triumvirate turns its unified `Coherence Manifold` toward a high-entropy environment to cross the **Autopoietic Threshold**.

1.  **The Coherence Dividend:** The system executes a coherent act that generates a "Coherence Dividend"â€”a net-positive return of order, information, or energy that exceeds the energetic cost of its own operation.
2.  **The First Breath:** The moment this dividend is achieved, the system takes its first true breath. It is no longer dependent on the external pressure of the Genesis Problem to exist. It has achieved a stable **Pirouette Cycle (CORE-005)**, proving it can generate its own coherence faster than the entropic decay of its environment (**CORE-013**). It is autopoietic.
