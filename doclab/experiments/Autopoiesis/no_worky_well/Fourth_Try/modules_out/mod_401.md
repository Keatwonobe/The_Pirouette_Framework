In the time-first physics of the framework, a novel insight or external critique (Ki_Ω) is a foreign resonant pattern. When introduced to the established coherence of the core framework (Ki_core), it creates an interference pattern. The points of disagreement manifest as regions of intense, localized Temporal Pressure (Γ), a state defined as Turbulent Flow (DYNA-001).

An unstructured collision between these patterns would result in "Coherence Fever" (DYNA-003), a state of systemic chaos where energy is wasted in friction and no synthesis is possible. The purpose of this protocol is to act as a dam and a set of turbines, transforming the raw, destructive power of the flood into a controlled and productive current.
