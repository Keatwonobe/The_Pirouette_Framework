The snap is not a uniform event; it has a character that reveals the forces at play. By observing changes in a system's coherence manifold, we can classify the nature of its transformation using a suite of precise metrics.

1.  **The Coherence Shockwave (The Shattering):**
    *   **Description:** Corresponds to the classic "black swan" event. This is the signature of a system overwhelmed by a sudden, violent spike in Temporal Pressure (Γ). Its coherence shatters into chaos, a state of acute Coherence Fever.
    *   **Manifestation:** A market crash; a brittle material fracturing under stress; a sudden, acute psychological breakdown. The system's structure fails.
    *   **Primary Metric:** **Kurtosis**. A sharp increase in the kurtosis of a system's output signal is the statistical residue of this temporal turbulence—a measure of the extreme outliers generated by the chaotic reconfiguration.

2.  **Ki Morphogenesis (The Unfolding):**
    *   **Description:** Corresponds to the "grey swan," marked by a change in complexity. This is not a shattering, but a fundamental change in the rules governing the system. The very geometry of its resonant `Ki` pattern changes its topology.
    *   **Manifestation:** The Cambrian explosion in biology; the adoption of a disruptive technology in an economy; a paradigm shift in science. The system's rules change.
    *   **Primary Metric:** **Fractal Dimension Change**. A sudden shift in the fractal dimension of the system's signal is a direct measurement of its `Ki` manifold changing its topological class—becoming more or less intricate and complex.

3.  **Resonant Alignment (The Ordering):**
    *   **Description:** Corresponds to the "white swan," a sudden snap into a higher state of order. Disparate parts snap into alignment, forming a more complex and coherent whole. This is the echo of a successful `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012).
    *   **Manifestation:** The spontaneous crystallization of a supercooled liquid; the flash of insight where disparate ideas suddenly connect; a leaderless movement suddenly organizing around a single, coherent goal. The system self-organizes.
    *   **Primary Metric:** **Coherence Flux (dKτ/dt)**. A rapid, non-linear increase in the system's overall coherence is the definitive sign that its components have phase-locked and crystallized into a more elegant state.
