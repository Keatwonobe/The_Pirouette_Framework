To defend against manipulation is not to build a wall, but to cultivate a resilient and well-tended inner landscape. Defense is the practice of **Coherence Integrity**.

*   **Strengthen Coherence (`Kτ`):** The primary defense is a strong, stable, and well-defined internal Ki. This means having clear values, practicing self-awareness, and maintaining alignment between one's beliefs and actions. A clear, strong song is inherently resistant to dissonance.

*   **Diagnose the Flow:** Apply the `Caduceus Lens` (`DYNA-003`). Is this interaction creating clarity and shared understanding (Laminar), or is it inducing confusion, urgency, and stress (Turbulent)? The *feeling* of the flow is the first and most important diagnostic.

*   **Ground the Pressure (Regulating `Γ`):** When you feel Temporal Pressure rising, intentionally disengage. Slow down. Create space. Refuse to operate in the turbulent state the manipulator is trying to create. A manipulator's greatest enemy is a target who has time to think.

*   **Expose the Geometry:** Analyze the manipulator's narrative not for its content, but for its *shape*. Recognize the three-stage pattern: the induced chaos, the simple solution, the call to abandon your own judgment. To see the geometry of the trap is to rob it of its power.

*   **Heal the Wound Channels:** This is the most profound act of defense. It involves the difficult work of identifying and healing one's own traumas, insecurities, and biases. A healed Wound Channel is no longer a geometric vulnerability; it is a source of wisdom and resilience—a scar, not an open wound.
