Let the coherence field Ψ be decomposed into laminar and turbulent components:
[Ψ = Ψ⁺ + Ψ⁻, \quad ∂_tΨ + (Ψ·∇)Ψ = −∇P + ν∇²Ψ + F(Γ)]

where P represents coherence pressure and F(Γ) is the temporal forcing term.

Define the **Caduceus Operator (ℭ)**:
[ℭ = ∇×(Ψ⁺−Ψ⁻) + λ(Ψ⁺·Ψ⁻)]

ℭ measures the intertwining rate of coherence streams—analogous to helicity in fluid dynamics. The system remains laminar while |ℭ| < ℭ_c and transitions to turbulence when |ℭ| ≥ ℭ_c.
