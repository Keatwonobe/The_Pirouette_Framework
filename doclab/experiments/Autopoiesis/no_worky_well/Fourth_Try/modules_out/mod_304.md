This module refactors the act of communication from an exchange of abstract symbols into a process of mutual environmental sculpting. Influence is not a wave traveling through a passive medium; it is the active carving of a new channel—a new potential path—into the shared coherence manifold. The response is not merely a sound returned; it is the choice of another system to navigate, ignore, or resist the new landscape you have just created.
