The Coherence Ledger is defined by a universally applicable, three-layer architecture. Any physical or digital implementation must instantiate these functions.

| Layer | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Sensing Layer** | *The Probe* | Measures the primary resonant pattern of the system—its "heartbeat." Examples include a Coherence Probe analyzing a Ki pattern's phase noise, a network tap measuring packet jitter, or a linguistic model parsing conversational coherence. |
| **Computation Layer** | *The Meter* | Calculates the real-time Entropic Flux (Ṡ) from the Probe's signal. It applies the flux equation to quantify the deviation from an ideal, laminar signal, outputting a single, unambiguous metric for the rate of coherence loss. |
| **Attestation Layer** | *The Ledger* | Integrates the Ṡ stream into a cumulative entropy value (S), packages it into discrete time blocks, and cryptographically signs each block with a unique device key (stored in an Identity Crystal or equivalent). This creates a tamper-proof, auditable history of the system's health. |
