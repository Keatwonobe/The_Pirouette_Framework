The universe does not have a "desire" for disorder. It simply follows the path of highest probability. A song—a coherent, resonant pattern—is a beautiful and statistically improbable state. It is an island of low Omega in an ocean of high Omega.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics is the mathematical description of the cost of singing that song. It is the constant, relentless pressure (Gamma) exerted by the ocean of probable states, which seeks to reclaim the island of improbable coherence. The arrow of time is the sound of the universe sighing, as all beautiful, unlikely songs eventually fade back into the vast, silent chorus of everything that could possibly be.
