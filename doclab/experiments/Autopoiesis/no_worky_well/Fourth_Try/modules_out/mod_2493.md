*“We caution against rigid, one-size-fits-all protocols.*  
1. **Context Matters:** Real systems are open, interdependent, and evolving—hard thresholds on \(T_a\) or \(\Gamma\) will fracture adaptive landscapes and create new blind spots.  
2. **Strategic Drift:** Adversaries can still orbit just inside the threshold (“boundary hugging”) to behave maliciously while passing audits.  
3. **Meta-Boundary Instead:** We recommend a **Reflexive Boundary Ritual** (inspired by RIT-ICS-005) that summons community review whenever a boundary is contested—forcing adversaries into a transparent duel rather than a static registry.  
4. **Fluid Definitions with Feedback:** Boundaries should emerge from collective resonance: nodes with persistent high-radiance interactions define the system, while low-radiance outliers self-exclude.  

*Flexibility with recursive, participatory review disincentivizes gaming far more effectively than brittle parameter gates.”*
