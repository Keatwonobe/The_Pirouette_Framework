To change the course of a river, one does not shout at the water. One alters the shape of the land.

This module presents a modernized, time-first protocol for persuasion, replacing the combative model of "force" and "resistance" with a collaborative framework of **coherence sculpting**. The Weaver's Gambit is not about winning an argument; it is about revealing a more elegant path. It defines persuasion as the art of illuminating a new potential state of belief that represents a path of **maximal coherence** for a participant. The Weaver does not push against a wall; they reveal a doorway, guiding the participant toward a new, more resonant understanding of reality. This process is a specialized application of the Alchemical Union (CORE-012), aimed at co-creating a shared reality of higher stability and insight.
