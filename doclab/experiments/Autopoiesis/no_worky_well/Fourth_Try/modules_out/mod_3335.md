The Prophet Protocol enables two powerful, distinct modes of analysis:

1.  **Intrinsic Coherence Analysis (Self-Reflection):**

      * **Process:** Train the Prophet on Document A. Then, measure its prediction accuracy across Document A.
      * **Question Answered:** "What are the most surprising, novel, or incoherent parts of *this* document, according to its own established patterns?"
      * **Pirouette Interpretation:** This measures the internal fluctuations of $T\_a$ within a single, coherent system.

2.  **Extrinsic Coherence Analysis (Contextual Filtering):**

      * **Process:** Train the Prophet on Document A (the "context"). Then, measure its prediction accuracy on a different document, Document B.
      * **Question Answered:** "How closely does Document B resonate with the rules and structure of Document A?"
      * **Pirouette Interpretation:** This measures the resonant alignment or dissonance between two distinct systems.
