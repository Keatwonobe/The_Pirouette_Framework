A theory's elegance is meaningless without proof. The engine's final and most crucial test is to derive the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2)—the most precise prediction in physics—from these same first principles. This validation replaces and re-contextualizes the old framework's search for a `Ki constant`.

*   **Spin as Topology:** In this framework, spin is not an intrinsic property but an emergent, topological feature of a particle's stable resonance (Ki). For a particle to persist, its resonance must form a self-referential knot in the coherence manifold. The Principle of Maximal Coherence demands this knot adopt a maximally resilient form. This re-frames the "Ki constant" of PPS-033 not as a number, but as the signature of the fundamental **Möbius topology** (CORE-009) of a fermion. An electron must rotate 720° to return to its starting state, and this two-cycle nature is the geometric origin of its baseline g-factor of g=2.

*   **The Anomaly as an Echo:** The tiny deviation from g=2 is caused by the electron's resonance interacting with the "wake" or "echo" of its own immediate past in the coherence manifold. The predicted value of this anomaly ($a_e$) is simply the product of the interaction's intrinsic strength (the fine-structure constant, α) and the geometry of a single echo cycle ($1/2\pi$).

    $$ a_e = \frac{g-2}{2} = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi} \approx 0.0011614 $$

This heuristic prediction matches the experimental value (~0.001159652) to within 0.15%, confirming the foundational soundness of the entire engine and demanding a more formal mathematical proof.
