Entropic manipulation of the environment is not a fleeting effect that requires concentration. It is a physical change to the world that decays slowly over time.

Duration: A patch of dynamically created difficult terrain remains in effect for one day per EP spent on its creation and intensification. A patch of terrain created with an initial 3 EP and intensified once with 5 EP (total 8 EP) would last for eight days (or until its entropy is exhausted by the environment like ice melting in the sun).
