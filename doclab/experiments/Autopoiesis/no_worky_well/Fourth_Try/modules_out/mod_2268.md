* **Module review:** verify each assumption is declared near first use.
* **Appendix A:** full linearization and gauge choices.
* **Appendix B:** example potentials and phase portraits for (C,\Gamma).
* **Appendix C:** mapping from coherence diagnostics to EFT observables.

> **One-line synthesis:** Geometry is the mesoscopic bookkeeping that keeps the coherence budget closedâ€”EH on the left, conserved (\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle) on the right, glued by the Newtonian match and guarded by Bianchi.
