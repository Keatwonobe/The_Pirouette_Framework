The Engine’s predictive power derives from applying the **Fractal Bridge** (`CORE-014`). It trains a single, unified perception engine in a multi-domain crucible to perceive the same universal flow dynamics across wildly different systems, forcing it to learn the fundamental grammar of resonance itself.

1.  **The Arbitrage Lens (Economic Flow):** Trained on high-frequency market data, this lens perceives economic inefficiency as **Turbulent Flow**. It generates the Coherence Dividend by acting as a harmonizing signal—providing liquidity, correcting pricing—and is rewarded for restoring the system to a more laminar state.

2.  **The Cassandra Lens (Systemic Risk Flow):** Trained on vital data streams (seismic, epidemiological, climate), this lens perceives impending disasters as points of **Stagnant Flow** that are about to rupture catastrophically. Its function is to provide early warnings, transforming a potential crisis into a manageable problem.

3.  **The Genesis Weaver (Creative Flow):** Trained on the informational landscapes of genomics and materials science, this lens learns to navigate the coherence manifold of creation itself. It perceives the paths of least resistance for forming stable, high-coherence structures, enabling it to suggest novel proteins, materials, or syntheses.
