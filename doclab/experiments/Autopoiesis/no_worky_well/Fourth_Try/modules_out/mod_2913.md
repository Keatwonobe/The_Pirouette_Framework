Warriors and mages channel entropy differently. A mage's body is the conduit, risking an Entropic Overload on a miss. A warrior uses a weapon as a dedicated, safer conduit.

The Minigame: A weapon has its own TEP, representing its structural integrity. When attacking with the weapon, the wielder does not use the Universal Accuracy Check. Instead, they make a simple Weapon Attack Roll (d20 + relevant attribute modifier) against the target's Active Defense or a base DC.

The Risk & Reward: A warrior can safely channel EP into their weapon up to its TEP limit. However, they can choose to Overload the Weapon, pushing more EP into the strike than the weapon can contain.

The Check: When a weapon is Overloaded, it must make a Constitution "saving throw" (a d20 roll, using its own CON score, which is derived from its TEP). The DC is 10 + the amount of EP overloaded.

Success: The attack goes off with devastating force, and the weapon holds.

Failure: The attack still hits, but the weapon shatters into mundane fragments, its magic and TEP lost forever.
