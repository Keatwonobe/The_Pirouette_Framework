The Social Dissonance Field (\mathbf{D}) quantifies the misalignment between the observed flow of interactions and the idealized coherence flow predicted by the Pirouette Lagrangian:

[\mathcal{L}*s = T_a,\omega_k - f(\Gamma; S*{soc})]

where:

* (T_a): persistence of norms and institutions
* (\omega_k): directional social motion (information/mobility phase)
* (\Gamma): social tension or informational pressure
* (S_{soc}): societal substrate (communication, mobility, policy networks)

(\mathbf{D}) measures the difference between the real and idealized fluxes:
[\mathbf{D} = \nabla \phi + \nabla \times \mathbf{A}]

where (\phi) captures unbalanced cooperative potential (gradient term), and (\mathbf{A}) captures antagonistic or circulatory motion (curl term).
