The Prime Directive’s focus on minimizing \(\Delta H = |H_p - H_t|\) and reducing systemic Dark Residue \(D\) conflates thermodynamic metaphors with moral imperatives. We must question:  
1. **Quantifiability** – How will agents reliably measure their own \(H_p\) or the global \(H_t\)?  
2. **Agency** – Does prescribing a universal enthalpy alignment override individual goals?  
3. **Scope** – What if minimizing \(D\) locally increases it elsewhere?
