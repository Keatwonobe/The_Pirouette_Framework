This module is the essential bridge between the abstract mathematics of `CORE-006` and the tangible world. The entire purpose of the Weaver's Lens is to provide a continuous stream of empirical `(Kτ, VΓ)` tuples.

By feeding this time-series into the Euler-Lagrange equation, a Weaver can solve for the system's geodesic—its path of maximal coherence. This transforms the Lagrangian from a philosophical principle into a predictive, physical tool that allows for:

*   **Diagnosis:** Identifying deviations from the optimal path (i.e., turbulence or stagnation).
*   **Prediction:** Forecasting the system's most probable future state.
*   **Intervention:** Calculating the precise energetic or informational input required to guide the system back to a more coherent trajectory.
