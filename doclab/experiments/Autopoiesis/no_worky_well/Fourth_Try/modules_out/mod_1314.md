The past is not a story we tell; it is a landscape we inhabit. Every event, from the pirouette of an electron to the birth of a star, leaves a geometric scar on the fabric of reality. This is the Wound Channel, the physical memory of the universe, as defined in CORE-011.

This module provides the laws and instruments to read that landscape. It reframes the passive concept of "correlation" into the active, physical principle of **geometric causality**. An entity's path is not a series of independent moments but a continuous navigation of a terrain shaped by the echoes of its own and others' histories. Influence is the measurable deviation a system undergoes from its natural path due to the geometric pressures of a Wound Channel. We will provide the calculus to measure the weight of the past.
