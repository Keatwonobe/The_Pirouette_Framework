The possibility of universal translation is guaranteed by the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014). The universe does not invent new dynamics for every domain; it is elegantly efficient and self-similar. The same principles of flow, pressure, and resonance that shape a galaxy also shape a thought. This is the **Principle of Structural Isomorphism**.

Consequently, any two stable systems, no matter how different their substrates, can be compared and even translated by mapping their underlying resonant geometries. The elegant spiral of a seashell and the arms of a galaxy are not a coincidence; they are two different instruments playing a similar note of coherence. We do not need to understand what an alien signal *means* semantically; we only need to measure its rhythm, its complexity, and its stability. In that structure, we can find echoes of structures we already know, a language that requires no dictionary, only a tuning fork.
