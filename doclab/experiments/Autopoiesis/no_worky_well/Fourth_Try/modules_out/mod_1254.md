summary: "Provides a modernized protocol for cosmological anomaly detection, reframing\
  \ it as a form of cosmic archaeology. This instrument replaces the static 'spacetime\
  \ lattice' with a dynamic 'Cosmic Coherence Manifold.' It maps the universe's 'Wound\
  \ Channels'\u2014persistent geometric scars left by foundational events\u2014by\
  \ calculating the residual between observational data and an idealized, 'unscarred'\
  \ baseline model derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian."
