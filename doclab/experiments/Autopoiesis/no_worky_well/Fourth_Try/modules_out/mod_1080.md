This axiom brings immediate and powerful clarity to the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), the framework's central equation of motion:

**`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`**

The "potential" term `V_Γ`, which represents the environmental cost of maintaining coherence, is no longer abstract. For any electromagnetic interaction, the function describing `V_Γ` is now scaled by `α`. This act transforms the Lagrangian from a qualitative principle into a quantitative tool capable of high-precision prediction. This new foundation clarifies the roles of the core dynamics:

*   **Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`, scaled by `α`)** defines the **Cost Landscape**—the challenging terrain the system must navigate; its steepness governs the interaction's **Strength**.
*   **Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`, derived from `Ki`)** describes the **Resonant Solution**—the elegant path the system finds through that terrain; its properties govern the interaction's **Rhythm**.
