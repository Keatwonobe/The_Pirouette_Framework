This derivation is not an ad-hoc invention; it is a direct and necessary consequence of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006).

1.  **Existence:** The electron itself is a stable, solitonic solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations applied to 𝓛_p, one whose Ki resonance possesses the required 720° topology.
2.  **Interaction:** The interaction with an external magnetic field (as derived in CORE-007) is the system's attempt to adjust its trajectory to maintain maximal coherence (maximize ∫𝓛_p dt) within a rotationally sheared manifold.
3.  **Self-Interaction:** The "echo" is the effect of the electron's own resonance on the local Temporal Pressure term (V_Γ) of its own Lagrangian. The anomaly is the measurable result of this self-referential term.

The entire phenomenon, from the existence of spin to the value of the anomaly, is a closed loop within the logic of a single equation.
