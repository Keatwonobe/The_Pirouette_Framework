* **Pressuron stiffness:** add (\lambda(\partial\Gamma)^4) to raise the gradient cost—enlarges the stability window.
* **Non-minimal coupling:** (\xi\Gamma^2 R) in curved backgrounds; in weak gravity treat as small corrections to profiles.
* **Gauge-coupled C:** allows gauged Q-balls (“Q-stars”) with magnetic pressure support.
