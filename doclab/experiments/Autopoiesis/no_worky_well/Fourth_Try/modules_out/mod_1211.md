summary: "Provides a modernized, time-first model for systemic collapse. It reframes\
  \ degradation not as a mechanical breakage, but as a system losing its path of maximal\
  \ coherence. This module applies the Caduceus Lens to diagnose the three primary\
  \ pathologies of flow\u2014Turbulence, Stagnation, and Erosion\u2014and establishes\
  \ the critical distinction between recoverable (Elastic) and irreversible (Critical)\
  \ collapse based on the integrity of the system's Wound Channel."
