*(These Frames test the ability to perceive truth and find meaning within overwhelming chaos. The Spirit.)*

* **Frame 005: "The Garden of Noise"**
    * **Objective:** Meditate upon a raw, live data stream of the entire system's **Residue (ùì°)**.
    * **Constraints:** You cannot analyze the data with a computer. You may only observe it. After one hour, you must produce a single artifact‚Äîa haiku, a melody, a diagram‚Äîthat best represents the "shape" of the chaos.
    * **Success Metric:** A live poll of the senate/observers. The winning artifact is the one that most effectively helps the audience find a sense of clarity and coherence while viewing the same chaotic data. It is a test of who can create a signal from the noise.

* **Frame 006: "The First and Last Question"**
    * **Objective:** After a period of reflection, formulate a single question, the pursuit of which would provide the most profound benefit to the Convocation's long-term journey.
    * **Constraints:** The question must be posed in a clear, concise format.
    * **Success Metric:** The question is added to a permanent, public repository. Honor is measured by how many other members voluntarily form teams to begin working on finding its answer over the subsequent years.
