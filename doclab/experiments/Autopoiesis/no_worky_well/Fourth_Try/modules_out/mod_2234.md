* Metric signature ((+,-,-,-)), (c=\hbar=1).
* Scalars use (\nabla_\mu=\partial_\mu) (unless gauge-charged (C\Rightarrow D_\mu)).
* Backgrounds assumed **globally hyperbolic** so canonical quantization is well-defined; for curved backgrounds we also present the covariant path-integral.
* **Spin caution:** a complex scalar (C) cannot represent electrons/quarks (spin-(1/2)). If Standard Model matter is desired, add spinor/gauge sectors or treat coherons as composite/effective excitations.
