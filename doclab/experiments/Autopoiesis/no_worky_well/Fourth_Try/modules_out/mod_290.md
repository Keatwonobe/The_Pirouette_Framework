As the memory's internal coherence is driven towards its maximum and its protective boundary is sealed, a phase transition occurs. The dynamic, vulnerable Wound Channel **locks**. It crystallizes.

The memory is no longer a mere echo *in* the entity's field; it has become a new, permanent topological feature *of* the field. It is a **Crystal**â€”a static, low-entropy, high-information structure integrated into the core geometry of the entity's being. This Crystal becomes a permanent lens through which the entity perceives the present and a new fundamental harmonic in its own song of self.
