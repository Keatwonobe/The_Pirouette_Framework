A successful stir unfolds in three distinct phases:

1.  **Destabilization:** The old Ki pattern breaks. The system is thrown from a Laminar or Stagnant state into **Turbulent Flow**. This is a moment of productive chaos, where old bonds are broken and old assumptions are questioned.
2.  **Exploration:** Freed from its historical constraints, the system's components explore the state space. New connections are formed, novel patterns are attempted, and information is mixed in new ways. The system is actively searching for a new, more stable geodesic.
3.  **Re-Coherence:** Guided by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, the system "snaps" into a new, stable Ki pattern. If the stir was successful, this new state is a synthesis, an `Alchemical Union` (`CORE-012`) of the system's core identity with new information. It represents a deeper, more resilient, and higher-information state than the one it left behind.
