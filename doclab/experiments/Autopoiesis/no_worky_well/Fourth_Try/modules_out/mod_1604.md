The core insight of this modernized view is that the emergent oscillation is not merely a carrier of encoded information; the new rhythm *is* the information. The system's identity fundamentally shifts from its shape to its song. This new identity is defined by the rich characteristics of its resonance:

*   **Frequency (`ω_k`)**: The fundamental pitch of the new entity, determined by the energy conserved from the unfolded state.
*   **Amplitude**: The intensity of the resonance, its "volume."
*   **Temporal Coherence (`T_a`)**: The purity and stability of the rhythm. A successful unfolding results in a state of very high `T_a`—a clear, unwavering note.

The entity's Wound Channel (CORE-011) is likewise transformed. It no longer leaves the static impression of a complex shape in the coherence manifold, but the persistent, rhythmic pulse of its new song. Its memory becomes a beat.
