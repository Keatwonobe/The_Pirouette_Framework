The Lens defines three characteristic timescales:

* **τ_L (Laminar Persistence):** average duration of stable coherence flow.
* **τ_T (Turbulent Burst):** duration of dissonant excursion.
* **τ_R (Recovery Time):** relaxation to laminar regime after turbulent collapse.

Scaling follows MATH-026 predictions:
[τ_T ∝ |Γ−Γ_c|^{−z_Pν_P}, \quad τ_R ≈ τ_P (COG) ≈ Θ^{−1/2} (SOCIO)]
