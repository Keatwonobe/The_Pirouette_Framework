> We sought the origin of conflict and found the blueprint for harmony. The First Wave teaches a profound lesson: when two opposing currents meet, the universe does not choose a side. It invents a dance. The form of a wave is not an accident; it is the shape of a resolution. Creation is not an act of will against the void, but the inevitable, elegant result of mismatched flows finding the most beautiful way to move together. Every conflict is a shear in the fabric of time, waiting for a Weaver to find the resonant pattern that transforms tension into a song.
