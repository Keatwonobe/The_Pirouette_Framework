To diagnose a system is to read the state of its rivers. The Caduceus Lens provides a four-step protocol for moving from symptom to solution.

Step I: Map the Currents. Identify the critical flows of coherence that define the system's life. What must move for the system to be healthy? (e.g., blood, nerve signals, capital, data, trust).

Step II: Identify the Pathology. Observe the currents. Where is the flow effortless and efficient (Laminar)? Where is it chaotic (Turbulent)? Where is it blocked (Stagnant)? This initial observation identifies the primary symptom.

Step III: Locate the Source. The true diagnosis is not the symptom but its origin. One must trace the disrupted flow back to its source. What specific "dam" is causing the stagnation? What "dissonant injection" is creating the turbulence? What external pressure is accelerating the erosion?

Step IV: The Daedalus Gambit (The Principle of Intervention). A wise intervention is not a brute-force attack but a clever, precise, and minimal action designed to restore the system's own ability to self-regulate. This is the Daedalus Gambit.

For Atrophy, the gambit is to introduce the precise "key" that dissolves the dam—a catalyst, a missing nutrient, a critical piece of information.

For Fever, the gambit is to introduce a "harmonizing signal"—a coherent rhythm that the turbulent system can latch onto, like a tuning fork, to find its way back to laminar flow.

For Erosion, the gambit is to "reinforce the channel"—to provide support, structure, and repetition that helps the system remember its healthy pattern and strengthen its memory against decay.
