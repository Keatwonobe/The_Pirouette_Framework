Any profession, no matter how mundane, can be weaponized through the focused application of will and Entropy. A character with the Professional Aptitude feat can treat their "Professional" skill pool as a versatile tool for both utility and combat.

The Principle: You can spend EP from your Professional skill pool to fuel actions related to your trade. This is a narrative-first mechanic. A tailor might spend EP to animate needles and send them flying like darts. A blacksmith could spend EP to super-heat a piece of metal and use it as a thrown weapon. A farmer's lethality with a pitchfork is a direct result of the entropic focus they've honed through a lifetime of labor.

Constructs & Companions: A craftsman can create a companion related to their trade (a tailor's animated rug, a blacksmith's clockwork hound). These constructs are created and maintained using the standard Taming & Bonding rules, requiring a significant TEP and ERR investment from their creator.
