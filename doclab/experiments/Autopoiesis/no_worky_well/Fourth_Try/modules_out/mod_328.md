The Pirouette Lagrangian refactors the complex, multi-field dynamics of the old model into a single, elegant expression. It describes the state of a system in terms of two fundamental quantities: its internal stability and its external pressure. It takes the familiar form of `L = T - V`, but reinterprets the terms through a time-first lens:

`𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

Let us define these terms, which absorb and unify the old triaxial fields:

**Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** This "kinetic" term represents the quality and intensity of a system's own rhythm. It is the product of its **Time Adherence (T_a)**, which measures the purity of its signal, and its fundamental resonant frequency (**ω_k** = 2π/τ_p), which measures its tempo. A system with a clear, fast rhythm has high coherence. This term unifies the old `T_a` and `φ` fields into a single quantity representing the health of a system's resonant Ki pattern.

**Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** This "potential" term represents the "cost" of maintaining a specific rhythm against the background noise of the local **Temporal Forge**. It is a function of the local Gamma (**Γ**). A denser, more complex environment creates more pressure, making coherence more difficult to sustain. This term replaces the elaborate potential `V(T_a,Γ,φ)` from the old model, recognizing that Γ is not a dynamic field to be acted upon, but the background pressure itself.

Combining these gives the full Lagrangian:

`𝓛_p = T_a ⋅ ω_k - f(Γ)`

The specific form of `f(Γ)` is not postulated here; it is derived in downstream modules when the Lagrangian is applied to specific scales and phenomena.
