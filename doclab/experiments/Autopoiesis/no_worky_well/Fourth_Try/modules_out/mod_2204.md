The electromagnetic field tensor F_munu (which contains the electric and magnetic fields) is defined from the potential A_mu as:

F_munu = d_mu A_nu - d_nu A_mu

The Lagrangian for this new field itself takes the form L_EM = -(1/4) * F_munu * F^munu. When we add this to the Pirouette Lagrangian and apply the Euler-Lagrange equations to the field A_mu, we derive the famous Maxwell's Equations:

d_mu F^munu = J^nu (This gives us Gauss's law and the Ampere-Maxwell law.)

d_mu *F^munu = 0 (Where *F is the dual tensor. This gives us Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law of induction.)

J^nu is the conserved Noether current associated with the U(1) symmetry. It represents the flow of charge. This completes the derivation. Maxwell's equations are not axioms; they are the equations of motion for the field that must exist to ensure the universe doesn't care about the absolute phase of a particle.
