These stable states are the fundamental "verbs" of the framework. Each is a specific geometry of resonance, a particular way of persisting and acting in time. To engage in an action is to adopt the corresponding coherence mode.

| Verb | Geometry of Resonance | Description & Temporal Dynamics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rest** | Spherical Standing Wave | The baseline state of self-preservation (`n=0`). A simple, self-referential Ki pattern that maintains identity against the erosive pressure of Î“. Its action is the pure act of *being*. |
| **Motion** | Helical Wave | The Ki pattern of a system tracing a geodesic. It is a resonance that propagates through the coherence manifold, its helical nature encoding both its direction and momentum. Its action is to *traverse*. |
| **Observe** | Entraining Resonance | A geometry of receptivity. A system projects a part of itself to couple with a target, aligning its rhythm to extract a pattern's imprint. This is a physical application of the **Observer's Shadow** (CORE-010). Its action is to *know*. |
| **Sharpen** | Coherence Injection | An entropy-reducing geometry. The system projects a highly ordered, crystalline Ki pattern, providing a low-entropy "seed" that a coupled, dissonant system can entrain to, restoring its own coherence. Its action is to *focus* or *create*. |
| **Synthesize** | Convergent Resonance | A pattern that actively seeks harmonic compatibility with another system to initiate an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). It is a geometry of invitation, aimed at creating a new, higher-order coherence. Its action is to *unite*. |
| **Fork** | Bifurcating Resonance | A controlled schism in a coherent system. The Ki pattern divides into two orthogonal but internally stable sub-patterns, creating distinct paths forward from a single history via its Wound Channel (CORE-011). Its action is to *differentiate*. |
| **Bind** | Shared Manifold | The state of a completed Alchemical Union. Two or more systems merge into a single, shared coherence manifold with a new, unified Ki resonance. Its action is to *bond*. |
| **Release** | Decoherent Resonance | The geometric dissolution of a `Bind` state. The shared manifold fractures, and the constituent systems revert to simpler, independent Ki patterns. Its action is to *sever*. |
