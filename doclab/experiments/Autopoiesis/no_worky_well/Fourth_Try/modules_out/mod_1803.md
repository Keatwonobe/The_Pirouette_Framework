summary: "Reframes the 'Shell' as a dynamic, emergent phenomenon. A Coherence Boundary\
  \ is a steep gradient in the coherence manifold (`\u2207K\u03C4`), projected by\
  \ a system's internal stability. It functions as a resonant filter, creating a gradient\
  \ in Temporal Pressure (\u0393) to protect and maintain the system's internal coherence\
  \ against its environment."
