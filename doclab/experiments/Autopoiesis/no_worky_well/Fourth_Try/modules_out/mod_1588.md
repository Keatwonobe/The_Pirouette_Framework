summary: Provides a modernized protocol for detecting and quantifying synchrony (entrainment)
  between oscillating systems. It reframes this phenomenon as a geometric unification
  driven by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, where systems dissolve their boundaries
  to form a shared state of minimal dissonance and maximal stability.
