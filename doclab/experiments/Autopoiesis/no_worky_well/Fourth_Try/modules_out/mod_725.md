The universe is not a single road; it is a river delta, endlessly branching. This module provides the ratified analysis of bifurcation events, or **Forks**, grounding them in the core principles of the time-first framework.

A Fork is not a random split or a chaotic breakdown, but a sophisticated and orderly act of creation. It is a geometric feature of the coherence manifold itselfâ€”a point of poise where a system's path splits into multiple viable futures. To navigate this junction, the system executes a **Resonant Inquiry**: it deliberately loosens its own internal coherence (Ki) to "sample" the available paths, listening for the echo of greatest harmony. It then collapses its state of potential, committing its entire being to the trajectory that promises the greatest future stability. This single mechanism is the engine of evolution, the basis of strategy, and the physics of will.
