*   **1-3 (Brittle):** A single mistake consistently cascades into more errors; body language is defeated; the team appears rattled and descends into Turbulence.
*   **4-6 (Standard):** Recovers from errors at an average pace; may show frustration but resets for the next play.
*   **7-8 (Tough):** Actively "stops the bleeding" after a bad sequence; demonstrates short memory for mistakes; leadership is visible in calming the system.
*   **9-10 (Antifragile):** Seems to use adversity as fuel; responds to an opponent's big play with an even better one; remains calm and focused in the most critical moments.
