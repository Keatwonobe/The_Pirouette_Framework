The Sentinel Protocol was co-designed with adversarial pressure in mind.

| Gaming Vector | Description | Countermeasure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Boundary Hugging** | Operating maliciously just inside static thresholds. | **Wound Channel Audit & Dynamic Gates.** An entity's history of creating residue, even if "compliant," will tighten its future gates. |
| **Cumulative Micro-Harm** | Many small attacks, each below the per-action detection limit. | **Cumulative Residual Logging ($R_c$).** The sum of the harm is tracked, ensuring the "death by a thousand cuts" vector is closed. |
| **Ritual Capture**| Flooding the adjudication process with bad-faith disputes or noisy data. | **Empirical Grounding.** The Ritual is only triggered by and must deliberate upon the objective Wound Channel data package, not on opinions. |
