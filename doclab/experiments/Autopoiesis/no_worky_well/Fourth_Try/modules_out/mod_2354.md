Mechanism C — Phase Transition & Cascade (Γ_H → 2Γ_L)
Hypothesis
C1. Early‑universe Γ sits in a metastable well with curvature m_H; a late phase transition (T_c) moves it onto a shallow tail with small curvature.
C2. Decay channel opens: Γ_H → 2Γ_L with tiny coupling ε; relic Γ_L forms the macroscopic mode; Γ_H today is absent or sub‑dominant.

Math sketch
• Potential with two regions: V(Γ)= ½ m_H^2 (Γ−Γ_a)^2 + ΔV + μ^4[1−cos(Γ/f)] for Γ>Γ_c.
• At T_c the effective mass tracks m_eff^2(Γ_bg)=V''(Γ_bg). Before T_c: heavy; after: light.
• Boltzmann: ṅ_H + 3H n_H = −⟨σv⟩ n_H^2 − Γ_{H→LL} n_H ; ṅ_L + 3H n_L = + 2 Γ_{H→LL} n_H + …

Predictions / tests
• Sharp feature in matter power spectrum at k_c set by transition epoch.
• CMB: ISW imprint from change in w_Γ; late‑time background drift constrained by integrated lensing.
• Lab/astro: transient early‑universe signature; no present‑day Γ_H abundance.
