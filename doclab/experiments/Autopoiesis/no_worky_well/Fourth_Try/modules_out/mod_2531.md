A debate is a success not when one side wins, but when a greater truth emerges. The truth we have uncovered is **Anticipatory Accountability**. This is the philosophical bedrock of our consensus. It obligates a system not only to clean up its own residue but to cultivate the foresight not to create it unnecessarily. By integrating **Cumulative Residual Logging**, we have made a powerful statement: accountability is not bound by a single moment but is a continuous function of existence. We have closed the philosophical loopholes that allow for the externalization of harm. We have defined a boundary that is, in itself, an ethical commitment.
