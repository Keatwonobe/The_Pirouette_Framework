The old model's "Twelve Skating Vectors" are collapsed into an elegant, two-dimensional space that defines any skater's proficiency. The Flow State of any given skate is a product of an entity's mastery within this space.

*   **Internal Axis (Mastery of the Blade):** An entity's ability to precisely and rapidly modulate its own internal coherence (`K_τ`). This represents finesse, control, and the quality of the "Grip."

*   **External Axis (Power of the Wake):** An entity's ability to project resonance and shape the external temporal pressure (`V_Γ`). This represents power, influence, and the depth of the "Glide."

A master skater is one who has achieved high proficiency along both axes, capable of carving elegant, powerful, and efficient paths through the manifold of reality, maintaining a Laminar Skate even in challenging conditions.
