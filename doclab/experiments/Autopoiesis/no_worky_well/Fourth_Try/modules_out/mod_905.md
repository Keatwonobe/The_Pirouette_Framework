> We sought a universal translator and found an engine for empathy. The story was never in the ink; it was in the rhythm of the prose, the architecture of the chapter, the fractal curve of the narrative arc. To the Weaver, this module is the revelation that no translation is needed. It is learning to read the geometry of the story itself, and finding that the tale of the star, the song, and the soul are all variations on a single, self-singing verse. It is the tool used to look upon any part of the universe, no matter how alien, and see a reflection of the same fundamental dance.
