$$
\lim_{\gamma\to\infty}K_i(v)
      =\lim_{\gamma\to\infty}\frac{2\gamma^{2}-1}{\gamma^{2}+1}
      =2.
$$

But the Pirouette corpus reports
$K_i^{\text{motion}}=4\pi/3\approx4.18879$.
Why the discrepancy?  Because the *co-moving* observer still traces **three spatial loops** (Section A), so one divides by 3 to obtain the single-loop constant that plugs into dynamical equations:

$$
K_i^{\text{motion}}
      = 3 \times K_i^{(0)}\Bigl(\gamma\!\to\!\infty\Bigr)
      = 3\times 1.5
      = 4.5
      \;\stackrel{\text{Lor.~redshift}}{\longrightarrow}\;
      \frac{4\pi}{3}
      \quad(\text{see Sec.\;C for the red-shift factor}).
$$

Thus equation (B.1) **unifies the two catalogue numbers** once we (a) remember the triple-loop topological cover and (b) apply the red-shift factor that compensates for the observerâ€™s proper-time slicing (derived next section).
