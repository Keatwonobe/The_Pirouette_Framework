Two of physics' greatest mysteries resolve not into new forces, but into consequences of this primordial geometry.

**Charge as a Geometric Address:** The properties we label as elementary charge (e.g., +2/3, -1/3) are not intrinsic substances a particle possesses. They are relational descriptions of which Resonance Pocket a quark's Ki pattern is currently occupying. Charge is a particle's geometric address within the Genesis Knot. Interaction rules, such as attraction and repulsion, are the geometric language of the manifold itselfâ€”certain pockets have a harmonic relationship, while others are dissonant. The law of charge conservation is revealed to be a law of topological conservation.

**Topological Confinement:** The Gladiator Force (CORE-008) is, at its root, an expression of this geometry. A quark is a resonance that can only exist within one of the Knot's lobes. To pull it out is to drag it into the dissonant "walls" between the pockets, where the cost of maintaining coherence rises exponentially. This is a coherence trap. The path of least resistance is a frantic retreat back into the pocket. The arena of the Gladiator is the very shape of the Genesis Knot. You cannot escape the rules, because the rules are the shape of the room.
