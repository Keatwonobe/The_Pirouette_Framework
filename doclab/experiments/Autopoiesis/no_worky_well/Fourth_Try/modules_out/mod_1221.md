For the echo of one system (the Source) to influence another (the Target), a three-part process must unfold, propagating through the shared medium of spacetime.

1.  **Emission (The Signal):** The strength and clarity of the outbound signal are determined by the Source's own internal coherence (`K_τ`). A system with a powerful, stable Ki pattern—a mind with a clear conviction, a star with a steady burn—emits a potent and well-defined echo from its Wound Channel (CORE-011). A weak, chaotic system emits only noise.

2.  **Propagation (The Medium):** The echo does not travel through a void but through the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) that fills the space between systems. This intervening medium's state defines the **Boundary Permeability**.
    *   **Low, Quiescent Γ** acts like still air, allowing the resonant echo to travel with high fidelity.
    *   **High, Turbulent Γ** acts like a storm, scattering and corrupting the signal, localizing influence.

3.  **Reception (The Resonant Handshake):** The Target system is not a passive recipient. It must be "tuned" to the Source's frequency. This is the principle of **Harmonic Compatibility**, a precursor to the Alchemical Union (CORE-012). If the Source's echo is harmonically related to the Target's own Ki, the Target's coherence manifold will readily accept and amplify the imprint. If they are dissonant, the echo is reflected or ignored.
