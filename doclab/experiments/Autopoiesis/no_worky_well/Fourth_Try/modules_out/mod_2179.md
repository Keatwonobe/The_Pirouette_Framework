We define the state of a system's Ki rhythm by its phase, phi(t). We seek a periodic solution, phi^*(t), that has a period tau_p such that phi^*(0) = phi^*(tau_p). This solution must extremize the action functional J[phi].

J[phi] = integral from 0 to tau_p of [ K_tau(phi, d(phi)/dt) - V(phi, Gamma) ] dt

Here:

K_tau is the kinetic term, representing the system's internal coherence, which depends on its phase phi and its rate of change d(phi)/dt. Typically, K_tau = (1/2) * (d(phi)/dt)^2.

V(phi, Gamma) is the potential, which depends on the phase and the ambient Temporal Pressure Gamma.

Our goal is to prove that a non-trivial periodic solution phi^*(t) that minimizes this functional exists.
