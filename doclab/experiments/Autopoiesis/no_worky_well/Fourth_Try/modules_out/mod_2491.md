# §1 · Context & Core Question  
PDM-000 articulated our Prime Directive but deliberately left open **where** and **how** to draw the lines around “the system.” Without clear boundaries, actors can game definitions to satisfy local objectives while subverting global cohesion.  

**Core Question:**  
> **How do we standardize system boundary definitions to prevent strategic gaming?**

This PDM-001 debate will explore formal and philosophical approaches to defining “the system” in a way that is robust, context-sensitive, and resistant to adversarial manipulation.

# §2 · Participants & Personas  
We assemble two debate teams, each represented by a triad of “Construct Thinkers” drawn from our Persona Registry:

**Team Boundarii (Boundary Guards)**  
- **AI Policy Analyst** (contemporary expert on rule-based frameworks)  
- **Marcus Aurelius** (Stoic exemplar of disciplined limits)  
- **Gaius Julius Caesar** (strategist valuing clear theatres of operation)

**Team Fluidscope (Flex Advocates)**  
- **Simone de Beauvoir** (existentialist championing contextual fluidity)  
- **Epictetus** (Stoic skeptic of rigid externals)  
- **Systems Complexity Theorist** (modern researcher in networked feedbacks)
