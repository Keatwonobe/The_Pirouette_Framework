Failures of Will are not failures of "strength," but diagnosable disruptions in this geometric process, best understood through the lens of **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**.

- **Turbulent Will (Conflict):** The agent projects multiple, competing Future Wound Channels. The coherence manifold is warped into a chaotic landscape with no clear geodesic. The agent expends immense energy moving in circles, fighting against its own divided intentions. This is the geometry of self-sabotage.

- **Stagnant Will (Paralysis):** The agent forms a coherent intent (the Seed) but cannot overcome the initial activation energy required to begin carving the path. The perceived slope of the default `V_Î“` landscape is too steep to climb. The desired future exists, but the journey toward it never begins. This is the geometry of procrastination.

- **Eroded Will (Apathy):** The agent makes an initial projection, but fails to sustain the focus required for Persistence. The delicate geometry of the Channel of Intent quickly dissolves under ambient pressure, and the manifold returns to its default state. The path vanishes as soon as it is created. This is the geometry of distraction and broken resolutions.
