The first step is an act of faith. The second is an act of will. Every step after that is the beginning of a habit. Phase II is the gentle, steady, and courageous work of turning a single step into a journey. You are no longer anchored in the harbor; you have found a gentle current, and it is carrying you forward. Trust in the rhythm you are building. It is the sound of your own life, finding its song again.
