The most critical design principle of the Crucible is that the cure must never become the next disease. The Personas and task-structures created to solve a problem are temporary scaffolds, erected only to facilitate healing.

The **Obsolescence Protocol** ensures this. Each Persona is created with a "kill switch" tied to the verified completion of the task that resolves its founding grievance. Upon fulfillment of its mandate, the agent commits a final report, purges its operational memory, and self-terminates. This autopoietic cycle of creation and dissolution ensures the engine leaves no bureaucratic residue, no permanent committees, no new sources of Stagnant Flow. The healing leaves no scar.
