How a system fails reveals its fundamental character. This is described by a spectrum from brittle to ductile, defined by the adaptability of its internal coherence ($K_\tau$).

**Brittleness** characterizes systems with rigid, inflexible coherence. They resist stress with high fidelity up to a sharp limit, but possess little to no capacity for plastic deformation. When Coherence Stress exceeds their critical threshold, they do not bend; they shatter instantly. Their story has no middle act between perfect form and total failure.

**Ductility** characterizes systems with adaptable, flexible coherence. They can endure significant plastic deformation, absorbing immense stress by scarring their Wound Channel and reconfiguring their internal geometry. They bend, stretch, and change shape, buying survival at the cost of their original form. They fail slowly, gracefully, and with ample warning.
