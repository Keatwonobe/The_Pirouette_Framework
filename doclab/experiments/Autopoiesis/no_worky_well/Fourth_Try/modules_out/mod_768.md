Before diagnosing illness, the Weaver must identify the physiology of health.
1.  **Map the Geodesics (Flow Channels):** The first step is to identify the primary paths of Laminar Flow—the network's healthy arteries. Algorithmically, this means finding the paths of maximal coherence (high `Φ_C`, low `Δτ`), where influence, resources, and information travel with the least resistance and highest fidelity.

2.  **Identify Resonant Enclaves (Coherent Shells):** The protocol then identifies clusters of nodes that have achieved collective resonance, forming a stable, higher-order entity. These "enclaves"—a form of **Arena (CORE-008)**—represent healthy teams, resilient functional modules, or stable communities. Their boundaries are defined by the sharp coherence gradient where their internal harmony meets the pressure of the wider network.
