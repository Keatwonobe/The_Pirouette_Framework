| **T·B** | Lorentz-covariant form of $T_a$; show it transforms as a scalar under boosts but red-shifts under proper-time dilation (mirrors Ki treatment).                                                                                                            |
| **T·C** | *Bench demo*: use a Hahn-echo on a single NV spin to pull $T_a(\Delta t)$ vs magnetic-noise floor; verify $T_a$ drops exactly like Eq. (A2) and plugs into the Γ–$T_a$ coupling term to predict spin-precession slowdown (a small but measurable effect). |

With **$T_a$ now dimensionless, experimentally calibrated, and linked algebraically to the decoherence constant $T_2$**, all three Pirouette parameters are fully derivable and measurable—closing the last open hole the neutral reviewer flagged.

Just say the word and we’ll draft T·B (covariance) or sketch the NV-centre experiment for T·C.
