*   **Principle Tested:** The Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`) is a self-confining feedback loop that, under extreme conditions, can become rhythmic and unstable.
*   **Hypothesis:** A new class of astrophysical object exists, called **Maws**: hyper-dense, high-spin bodies where the Gladiator Force feedback loop becomes oscillatory. Instead of a stable event horizon, a Maw rhythmically creates and collapses folds in the coherence manifold, releasing sharp, periodic bursts of high-frequency gravitational waves.
*   **Experimental Design:** A search in next-generation GHz-range gravitational wave detectors, or a re-analysis of existing LIGO/Virgo data for periodic, high-frequency signals currently filtered as noise. The signature is not a chirp, but a drumbeat.
*   **Predicted Signature:** A Maw will produce a continuous gravitational "drumroll."
    *   **The Thump:** Each event is a millisecond-duration gravitational wave burst with a peak frequency in the **1-10 GHz range**.
    *   **The Rhythm:** The thumps repeat with a clock-like regularity between **10 and 100 Hz**, set by the Maw's spin and tension-release cycle.
    For a 5-solar-mass Maw, this predicts a train of sharp GW bursts, each peaking at **~4.5 GHz**, arriving with a relentless cadence of **~30 Hz**.
*   **Framework Connection:** This tests the behavior of the Pirouette Lagrangian when the non-linear feedback between a system's coherence (`K_τ`) and the temporal pressure it generates (`V_Γ`) becomes the dominant, unstable dynamic.
