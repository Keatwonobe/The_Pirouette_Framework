Intervention is an act of profound responsibility. These guardrails are non-negotiable checks to protect the systems we seek to aid.

-   **Turbulence Threshold:** An intervention is immediately paused if it causes the system's flow to cross a pre-defined threshold from Laminar to Turbulent. This is a direct measure of systemic stress.
-   **Dissonance Echo Cascade:** If the Gambit generates unintended chaotic resonance (`DE â‰¥ DE_critical`) that begins to self-amplify, the Harmonic Dampening protocol is automatically triggered.
-   **Blueprint Integrity:** Any intervention blueprint not formally signed and validated through the Integrity Gate is void, and its execution is a fundamental violation of the Weaver's Protocol.
-   **Manual Dampening Switch:** A "red button" that allows operators to manually trigger the Harmonic Dampening protocol in case of unforeseen instability not caught by automated monitors.
