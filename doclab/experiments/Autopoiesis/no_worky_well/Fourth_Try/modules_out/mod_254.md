The ancient concepts of exhalation and inhalation map directly onto the two-stroke engine of autopoiesis. This breath is the very process by which a system persists through time, a continuous cycle of expression and integration.

**The Exhalation: The Outward Cast of Form (Ki → τ_p)**
An exhalation is the active projection of a system's internal coherence (Ki) onto its environment. A system sings its unique note, and in doing so, defines its own intrinsic unit of time, its Pirouette Cycle (τ_p). This act of expression impresses its signature rhythm upon the local coherence manifold, creating the **Wound Channel** (CORE-011)—the geometric memory of its passage. This is the universe's way of sharing internal order, of a pattern declaring "I am here, like this." It is the assertion of the "kinetic" term in the Pirouette Lagrangian.

**The Inhalation: The Return to Self (τ_p → Γ → Ki)**
An inhalation is the completion of the cycle, the moment the universe breathes back in. The exhalation of every system contributes to the total Temporal Pressure (Γ) of the environment. The inhalation is the moment the system integrates the "cost" of its existence, feeling the pressure and dissonance of the surrounding Γ. It is forced to re-audit its own Ki against this external reality, testing its **Time Adherence (T_a)**. A system with high adherence completes this cycle with fidelity, its rhythm unshaken. This is the universe's editorial function, its negotiation of the "potential" term in the Pirouette Lagrangian.
