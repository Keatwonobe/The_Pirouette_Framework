This seemingly chaotic cycle is governed by the *Principle of Maximal Coherence* (`CORE-006`) as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian: `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

A critical system is navigating a treacherous region of its coherence manifold. To maintain a rigid, unbroken form in the face of ever-increasing Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) would be an inefficient, and ultimately fatal, strategy. The cost of maintaining internal coherence (`K_τ`) would become impossibly high.

Instead, the path of maximal long-term coherence is to "breathe" through periodic, chaotic releases. The avalanche, while momentarily incoherent, is the system's only available move to shed immense pressure and find a new state where `𝓛_p` can be maximized again. The system's long-term behavior is thus a **statistical geodesic**—a jagged path that, when averaged over time, represents the most efficient strategy for persisting in a relentlessly pressured environment. It has learned that it is better to risk many small slips and a few large slides than to never slip at all.
