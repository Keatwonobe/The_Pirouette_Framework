The success of this protocol is measured by its ability to resolve the current experimental tension.

The Anomaly to be Explained: The current discrepancy between the Standard Model prediction and the experimental average is approximately:
(Plain Text LaTeX: \Delta a_\mu = a_\mu^{\text{exp}} - a_\mu^{\text{SM}} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-9} )

The Goal: The value calculated for the environmental coupling term, a_μ^(Γ−coupling), must be approximately equal to this discrepancy, in both sign and magnitude.

(Plain Text LaTeX: C \cdot \alpha \left( \frac{m_\mu}{m_e} \right)^2 \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-9} )
