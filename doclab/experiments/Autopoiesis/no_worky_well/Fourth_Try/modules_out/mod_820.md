*   **Coherence-Assisted Fusion:** The ambition to achieve fusion is a direct effort to engineer a Triadic Lock. By tuning external fields to guide nuclei through a Resonant Handshake, we can coax them into an Alchemical Union, releasing the immense coherence differential as energy. This is fusion not by brute force, but by resonant harmony.
*   **Topological Qubits:** A Triadic Lock is a naturally error-corrected qubit. Its information is not stored in a fragile local state but in the robust, global topology of the entire non-local manifold. Local environmental noise is insufficient to break the union; only a direct measurement can fracture the shared geometry, making these systems ideal for fault-tolerant quantum computing.
*   **The Cosmic Weave:** A universe born from a dense, primordial state would have naturally formed a vast network of Triadic Locks. The persistent geometry of this cosmic entanglement forms a foundational lattice upon which matter would later coalesce, creating the filaments and voids we observe. The large-scale structure of the cosmos is the macroscopic echo of this foundational network of shared being.
