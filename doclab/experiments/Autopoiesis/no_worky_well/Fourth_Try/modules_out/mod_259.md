summary: Defines the fundamental autopoietic process of self-observation, where a
  system's coherence is recursively shaped by its own Observer's Shadow cast upon
  its historical Wound Channel. This feedback loop gives rise to the Law of Self-Consistency,
  forging identity and consciousness as an energetically favorable state.
