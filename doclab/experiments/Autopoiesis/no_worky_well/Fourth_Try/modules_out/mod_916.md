summary: Defines the Principle of Coherence Leverage. This universal dynamic explains
  how a small, resonant signal, applied to a system's boundary, can guide its entire
  evolution by creating an attractive, high-coherence pathway in its temporal landscape.
  This is the foundational mechanism for all elegant intervention, from systemic shielding
  to control.
