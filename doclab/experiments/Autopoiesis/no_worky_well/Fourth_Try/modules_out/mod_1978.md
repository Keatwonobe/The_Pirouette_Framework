The goal here is not to build strength, but to gently remind the body of its own natural language of movement.

The Practice:

Ankle Pumps: While lying down, gently point your toes away from you, then flex them back toward you. Repeat 10 times.

Gentle Marches: While seated, slowly lift one knee a few inches, then lower it. Alternate legs.

Supported Coughs: When you need to cough, hug a pillow tightly to your chest. This braces your incision and reduces pain, allowing for a necessary function to occur with less trauma.

The Walk: Short, slow walks of 3-5 minutes on a flat, safe surface, as advised by your clinical team. The goal is rhythm, not speed.

Helper's Role (The Steady Hand): Your role is one of support and observation. Offer a steady arm during walks. Watch for signs of overexertionâ€”shortness of breath, a grimace of pain, a change in color. Your job is to be the voice of gentle caution, reminding them that stillness is the work right now.
