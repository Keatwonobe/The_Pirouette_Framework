In the modern framework, a **Flow Channel** is a geodesic—a path of least action and maximal coherence—through the manifold described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). It is a stable, predictable current in the river of time where the path forward offers maximal coherence for minimal energetic cost.

-   **Flow Channels:** These are regions where the gradient of Temporal Pressure (Γ) is smooth and low. An entity moving along such a path experiences time in a consistent, non-turbulent manner.
-   **Temporal Resonance Condition:** An entity enters Flow when its internal clock—the rhythm of its perception-action cycle—achieves resonance with the rhythm of the Flow Channel. The phase difference between the agent and its environment approaches zero (Δτ ≈ 0). This is not a static state but a dynamic, self-correcting lockstep; a dance where each partner's step anticipates the other's.
