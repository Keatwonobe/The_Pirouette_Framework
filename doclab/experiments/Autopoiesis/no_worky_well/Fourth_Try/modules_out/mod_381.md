Before you can chart a course, you must know your starting position and the shape of your vessel.

1.  **Trace Your Wound Channel:** Using the lens of CORE-011, map your history. What formative experiences, habits, triumphs, and traumas define the active geometry of your present identity? Be honest about this terrain.
2.  **Diagnose Your Flow:** Using the lens of DYNA-001, assess the primary currents of your life (e.g., career, relationships, health). Where is your energy moving with effortless grace (Laminar Flow)? Where is it consumed by friction (Turbulent Flow)? Where is it blocked entirely (Stagnant Flow)?
3.  **Assess Your Parameters:**
    *   **Your Coherence (Kτ):** What are your core, stable patterns of being? In what states do you feel most "yourself," most effective, most whole? This is your baseline coherence.
    *   **Your Pressure Response (V_Γ):** How do you react to external stress, chaos, and pressure? Do you become rigid and brittle, or dissolve into the chaos? Understanding your response to Γ is crucial.
