The twelve archetypes are preserved not as a static list, but as functional, dynamic strategies for managing coherence at a boundary. They are grouped by their primary relationship to the flow of resonance and information.

**I. Integrity (Guarding Coherence)**
These archetypes prioritize the preservation of the internal `Ki`.
*   **Barrier:** Maximizes internal stability by minimizing interaction.
*   **Reflector:** Actively repels external influence by inverting its phase.
*   **Damper:** Absorbs and dissipates external temporal energy to prevent internal disruption.

**II. Exchange (Mediating Coherence)**
These archetypes are masters of the Resonant Handshake.
*   **Filter:** Permits passage only to harmonically compatible `Ki` patterns.
*   **Amplifier:** Uses its own resonance to boost the coherence of a passing, matched signal.
*   **Transformer:** Engages in a micro-Alchemical Union with a passing entity, altering its `Ki` pattern.

**III. Adaptation (Evolving Coherence)**
These archetypes modify their own structure over time, using the memory of their Wound Channel (`CORE-011`).
*   **Adaptive:** Modifies its permeability based on past interactions.
*   **Memory:** Records the `Ki` signatures of all interactions on its boundary.
*   **Oscillator:** Modulates its permeability in a rhythmic, predictable cycle.

**IV. Structure (Complex Coherence)**
These archetypes describe higher-order arrangements of Shells.
*   **Nested:** A hierarchical arrangement of Shells within Shells, creating layered domains of coherence.
*   **Fractal:** A self-similar boundary pattern that expresses the same geometric rules across multiple scales.
*   **Projector:** A Shell that actively shapes the coherence manifold beyond its physical boundary, casting its "Observer's Shadow" (`CORE-010`) onto its environment.
