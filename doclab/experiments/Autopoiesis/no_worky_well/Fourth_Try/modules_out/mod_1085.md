summary: "Reframes the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability as the primary physical proof\
  \ of Ki Morphogenesis. This module demonstrates how a shear in the flow of time\
  \ (Temporal Pressure, \u0393) is resolved by the emergence of a stable, resonant\
  \ geometry (Ki). This process is shown to be a direct manifestation of a system\
  \ following its geodesic path toward Maximal Coherence, as dictated by the Pirouette\
  \ Lagrangian."
