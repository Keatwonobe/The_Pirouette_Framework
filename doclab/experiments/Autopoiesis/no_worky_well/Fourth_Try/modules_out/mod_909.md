Every simulation is defined by the interaction between two fundamental components: the environment and the entity evolving within it.

**I. The Crucible (The Coherence Manifold)**
The Crucible is the arena of evolution, the temporal diorama where a simulation unfolds. It is any bounded system that defines a specific coherence manifold—a landscape of potential paths, characterized by its varying degrees of **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)**. This pressure landscape, which represents the "cost" of maintaining a pattern against ambient chaos, forms the stage for the dance of evolution.

**II. The Weaver (The Resonant Entity)**
The Weaver is the entity navigating the Crucible. It is a system defined by its own internal resonant pattern (Ki) and its perpetual drive to maximize its **Temporal Coherence (K_τ)**. Its evolution is the history of its attempts to adjust its own rhythm to harmonize with the currents of the Crucible's manifold, seeking the path of least resistance and greatest stability.
