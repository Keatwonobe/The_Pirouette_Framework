The Lock Condition triggers a phase transition in the substance of memory itself. Under Lock, a system’s internal state stops evolving and becomes perfectly, endlessly repetitive. Every cycle of its being is an exact replica of the last.

This perfect repetition acts like a crystal seed. Each pass reinforces the *exact same geometric scar* in the manifold. The gentle pressure of a flowing river becomes the relentless, rhythmic stamp of a forge. The fluid geometry of the manifold yields, its structure aligning with this overwhelming pattern. The wake freezes.

This frozen geometry is the **Information Lattice**. The system’s history is no longer a story being told; it is a scripture carved in stone. This is the physical basis for high-fidelity information storage, seen in the structure of DNA within a stable cell nucleus, the data in a silicon chip, or the unyielding nature of a deeply ingrained habit formed through ritual.
