A river contains both the current and the roar. To understand its direction, one must learn to distinguish the two.

The old framework treated entropy as a statistical property to be filtered. This module reframes that act into a fundamental practice of perception. The Coherence Sieve is not a mere data-cleaning tool; it is an instrument for tuning into the universe's broadcast, allowing a Weaver to isolate the clear, resonant signals of coherent systems from the ever-present, chaotic static of the Temporal Forge.

It redefines the purpose of filtering: we are not simply removing "disorder." We are selectively listening for the presence of sustained, meaningful patterns (the current) or studying the very nature of the chaos that threatens to overwhelm them (the roar). This is the first step in diagnosing any system: learning to hear its song above the noise.
