The electric field (E) is the mathematical representation of this coherence landscape. The "propagating echo" of the old module is now understood as a formal gradient. For a static charge, the electric field is directly proportional to the gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian in the surrounding space.

A test charge placed in this field does not feel a "push" or "pull." It senses a slope on the manifold of coherence. The "force" it experiences is the consequence of it following the steepest path toward its own state of maximal coherence. It is "coherence surfing" down the gradient established by the source charge. The inverse-square law emerges naturally as the geometric dilution of this gradient across the surface of a three-dimensional sphere.
