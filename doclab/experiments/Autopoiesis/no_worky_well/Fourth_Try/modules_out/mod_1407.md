The practical implementation is a streamlined, four-stage process that moves from raw data to actionable diagnosis and forecasting.

1.  **Map the Manifold:** Multi-sensor data (COSMIC-2, Swarm, radar) is ingested to construct a real-time map of the local coherence manifold, charting the background Temporal Pressure (`Î“_env`).
2.  **Measure the System:** Algorithms calculate the plume's core geometric properties, primarily its fractal dimension (`D`).
3.  **Diagnose the State:** The measured values are used to compute the real-time `PCI`. The system's flow state (Laminar, Turbulent, Stagnant) is diagnosed.
4.  **Forecast the Geodesic:** The diagnosis becomes the input for forecasting. The model calculates the path of maximal coherence through the mapped pressure landscape, predicting the plume's likely evolution and impact.

The output is a concise, actionable report for operators:
