The act of practice is a direct intervention on the practitioner's personal **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`). It is an act of *terraforming* the internal landscape so that the state of maximal coherence *becomes* the desired skill.

`𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence Kτ) - (Temporal Pressure V_Γ)`

-   **Before Practice:** Performing the desired skill is an act of low coherence and high pressure. The Lagrangian value is low, or even negative. The system will naturally avoid this path in favor of easier, pre-existing habits.
-   **After Practice:** By carving the Wound Channel, the agent has permanently lowered the Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) associated with the skill and created a "coherence well" that increases the potential for internal Coherence (`Kτ`). The Lagrangian value for this action is now extremely high.

Mastery is achieved when the Lagrangian for the desired skill path, `𝓛_p(skill)`, is consistently higher than that of any competing habit, `𝓛_p(habit)`. The universe's own optimization principle now works for the practitioner. The agent doesn't *choose* the mastered action so much as they are *drawn* to it by their own, newly sculpted, fundamental drive to maximize coherence.
