CORE DECLARATIONS (D)

D1 — Parameter Classes and Allowable Operations
• Universal constants U = {u_k}: derivable from axioms/symmetries only; at most a single global scale may be anchored once (see D3).
• Portal/topology indices T = {t_j}: integer or signed indices attached to spinorial/topological class; sign and scaling must follow from topology, not data fitting.
• Nuisance parameters N = {n_m}: experimental or environmental; may be taken from external literature but **never tuned** to improve fit.

D2 — Symmetry‑Fixed Functional Forms
The effective pressure term f(Γ) and related nonlinearities must satisfy simultaneously:
(i) Locality: depend on Γ and ∂Γ only to first order in the low‑energy limit.
(ii) Analyticity at equilibrium: expansion has only even powers under background T‑symmetry.
(iii) Scale covariance: under Γ → λΓ the action changes by a boundary term; this pins the leading exponent uniquely.
Any form violating (i)–(iii) is **inadmissible**.

D3 — One‑Shot Anchoring Rule
Exactly one anchor is permitted to set a single global scale (e.g., electron a_e). After this operation, **all** U, T are frozen. No re‑anchoring across observables or species.

D4 — Preregistration & Out‑of‑Sample Tests
Before evaluation, publish a docket (see P4) with code hash, seeds, priors, and locked targets. Results are scored strictly out‑of‑sample.

D5 — Anti‑Numerology Reporting
All papers must report AIC/BIC, Bayes factors, and ablations for: (A) full model, (B) no‑portal, (C) free‑fit powers. If (B) or (C) dominates, the simpler/worse‑falsifiable model is preferred.

D6 — Metaphor→Math Equivalence
Every metaphorical entity must be paired with a formal object and equivalence proof or explicit isomorphism. Unpaired metaphors are non‑claim‑bearing.

D7 — Dual Non‑Perturbative Track
For observables sensitive to back‑reaction: (i) finite‑element/spectral solvers for the soliton echo problem; (ii) RG coarse‑graining on (Γ,K)‑space. Either track may be used, but at least one is required for claims beyond perturbation.

D8 — Hadronic Insulation via Ratios
Publish at least one parameter‑free **dimensionless ratio** that cancels leading hadronic VP, e.g.
R = (a_μ − r² a_e) / (a_τ − r⁻² a_μ), r = m_μ/m_e.
Any hadronic dependence must appear only at higher order with quantified bounds.

D9 — Versioning & Change Control
Changes to U, T, or functional forms require: prereg notice, justification (symmetry/topology), updated code hash, and regeneration of all forecasts.
