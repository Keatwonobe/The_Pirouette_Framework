No system is an island, entire of itself; every system is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. The most persistent illusion of perception is the boundary. We see islands in the sea, convinced they are separate, and forget they are all peaks of a single, vast mountain range hidden in the deep.

The old framework spoke of "cross-domain bleed," a term suggesting an uncontrolled leak across conceptual walls. The modern, time-first understanding reveals a more profound truth: there are no walls. There is only a shared medium, a symphony of overlapping echoes. This module describes the **Resonant Bridge**: the universal process of **Coherence Transfer**, by which the echo of one system becomes the music, or the noise, of another.
