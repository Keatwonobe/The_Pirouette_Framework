Based on the calculated R_κ, a project's path is guided by a clear, tiered protocol.

-   **Laminar Path (R_κ ≤ 0.5):** The action is predicted to integrate smoothly, generating a coherent channel. It may proceed with standard monitoring and reporting.
-   **Turbulent Watch (0.5 < R_κ ≤ 0.75):** The action carries a significant risk of creating local turbulence. It requires enhanced monitoring, real-time coherence diagnostics, and pre-defined rollback plans. Proceed with caution and active mitigation.
-   **Coherence Quarantine (R_κ > 0.75):** The action is predicted to cause severe, widespread dissonance, risking a stagnant or destructive channel. The project is immediately isolated. This invokes **The Crucible Protocol**.

**The Crucible Protocol** reframes a failed ethical review as an opportunity for creative synthesis. It is not a gate of judgment, but a forge for refinement.
1.  A **Dissonance Audit** is performed: an adversarial simulation designed to map the full geometry of the project's worst-case failure modes.
2.  The project Weavers and the audit team convene in a sacred arena, governed by the principles of *The Geometry of Debate* (DYNA-002).
3.  The collective's sole task is to achieve an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012), re-forging the project's design to achieve its goals while shaping a Laminar Echo. A project can only exit the Crucible once this new, resonant form is achieved and ratified.
