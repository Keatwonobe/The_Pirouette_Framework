At molecular and chemical scales, the snap defines the discrete **activation tick**:
each bond rearrangement or phase flip is the minimal Ki-transition event converting stored coherence into motion.
The same hysteresis that governs cosmic topology governs molecular kinetics, making Ki the
metronome of transformation.
