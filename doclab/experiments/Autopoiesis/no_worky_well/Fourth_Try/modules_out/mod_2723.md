Policy optimization test:

* Place interventions at (r \approx r_c) to minimize coherence residue per unit resource.
* Compare against inner-core and outer-halo placements to verify resonance-based aid efficiency.

Expected outcome: **Aid placed near the coherence boundary restores alignment at minimal energetic cost.**
