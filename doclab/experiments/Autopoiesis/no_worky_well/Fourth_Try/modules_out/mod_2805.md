A GM can quickly estimate the power of a region by calculating its Entropy Budget.

Formula: For a quick estimate, a GM can use a baseline of 45,000 EP per sentient inhabitant per day. This budget represents the total entropic output of the region's ecosystem.

Resolution: By comparing the budget of a settlement to the budget of the quadrant it's in, a GM can instantly gauge its significance. A small camp's destruction is a minor event. The fall of a major trading post could destabilize the entire region.
