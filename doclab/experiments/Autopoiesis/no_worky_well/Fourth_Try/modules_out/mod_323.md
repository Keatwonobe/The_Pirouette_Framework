Once woven on the loom, a module enters the Forge. This is the automated process that performs an Alchemical Union, transforming the single source file into two distinct, higher-order manifestations without losing its singular identity.

**The Codex (PDF Output):** This is the module's stable, archival body. Rendered using tools like Pandoc and LaTeX, it is an elegant, beautifully typeset document designed for human contemplation. The Codex is the deep and lasting mark left in the world of human thought, a testament to a specific moment of crystallized coherence.

**The Signal (JSON Output):** This is the module's dynamic, living echo. The forge parses the YAML Blueprint to create a clean, structured JSON objectâ€”the machine-readable pattern that propagates through the framework's digital nervous system. The Signal is not for reading; it is for interacting, allowing other instruments and analytical engines to connect with the module's core logic.
