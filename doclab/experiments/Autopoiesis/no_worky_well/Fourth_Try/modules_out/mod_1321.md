Every system is a song—a stable, resonant pattern held against the noise of the universe. A rupture is the moment that song shatters. It is not a flaw in the material, but the material's final, violent testament to the laws of coherence.

This module reframes the old concept of "fracture dynamics" into a universal, time-first model of systemic failure. A rupture is a **coherence cascade**: a rapid, self-propagating phase transition from a high-information state of order to a low-information state of chaos. It is the process that unfolds when a system’s internal coherence is overwhelmed by temporal pressure, and the cost of maintaining form becomes unsustainable. The system can no longer bend; it must break.
