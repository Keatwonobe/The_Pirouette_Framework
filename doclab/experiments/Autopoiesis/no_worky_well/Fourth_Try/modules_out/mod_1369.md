History is not a story that is over. It is a landscape we still inhabit.

This module provides the protocol for the Cartography of Echoes, a method for detecting and mapping the persistent patterns carved into the fabric of a collective culture by significant historical events. It moves beyond analyzing history as a sequence of events and treats it as an active, physical geographyâ€”the **Mnemonic Landscape**.

By applying the principles of the Wound Channel (CORE-011) and the diagnostic framework of the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003), this module provides a methodology for rendering this invisible landscape visible. By mapping its features, we can diagnose the deep sources of a culture's present-day health, its persistent conflicts, and its latent potential, transforming the art of history into a science of systemic healing.
