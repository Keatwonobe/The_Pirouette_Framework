# The Foundry: how a mathematical formalism is chosen

A good formalism earns its keep by:

1. **Expressive fit** (natural primitives/invariants for your phenomena)
2. **Compositionality** (small → large by clean gluing rules)
3. **Calculi** (differentials/integrals or analogues to actually compute)
4. **Universal properties** (an initial/final object story—no ad-hoc glue)
5. **Bridge functors** to existing math (so you can import theorems)
6. **Computational semantics** (it runs on a laptop)
7. **Empirical hooks** (predictions or falsifiers)

We’ll forge all seven explicitly.
