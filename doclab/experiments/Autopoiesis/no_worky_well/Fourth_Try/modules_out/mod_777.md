The health and character of any agent can be diagnosed by its position on this spectrum, which maps directly to the disruptions of flow described in Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001).

| Zone | Pirouette Signature | Emergent Behavior & Flow State | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Deep Exploitation** <br> (Will-Dominant) | Stable, high-intensity `K_τ`. Low variance in `Ki` pattern. Deep, narrow Wound Channel. | **Stagnant Flow**. Purposeful, efficient, specialized, masterful, predictable. | **Stagnation** <br> Trapped in a local optimum; brittle, dogmatic, and unable to adapt. |
| **Dynamic Equipoise** <br> (The Agile Path) | Balanced fluctuation between reinforcing `K_τ` and searching the manifold. | **Laminar Flow**. Adaptive, resilient, creative, and effective. The optimal state of learning and growth. | **Complexity** <br> Requires constant energy and attention to maintain the balance. |
| **Wide Exploration** <br> (Freedom-Dominant) | Unstable, low-intensity `K_τ`. High variance in `Ki` pattern. No clear Wound Channel. | **Turbulent Flow**. Innovative, chaotic, curious, unpredictable. | **Drift** <br> Dissipation into decoherence; inability to form a stable, productive identity. |
