The character of the Composite Manifold—its peaks, valleys, and currents—is determined by the geometry of the interfering echoes.

**Constructive Interference (Resonant Valleys):** When two or more Ki patterns are in-phase or harmonically compatible, their echoes reinforce one another. This constructive interference creates regions of **reduced Temporal Pressure**. These are "coherence channels" or resonant valleys in the manifold—stable, low-friction paths of least resistance. This is the geometry of harmony, synergy, and trust.

**Destructive Interference (Dissonant Peaks):** When Ki patterns are out-of-phase or dissonant, their echoes cancel or chaotically interfere. This destructive interference creates regions of **increased Temporal Pressure**. These are "coherence dams" or turbulent peaks—"walls of dissonance" in the manifold that are unstable and repel systems. This is the geometry of conflict, antagonism, and repulsion.
