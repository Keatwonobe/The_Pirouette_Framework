With the potential altered, the system's dynamics must also change. The stable, periodic Ki rhythm (phi^*(t) with period tau_p) that existed under V is no longer a stable solution under V'. The system must now find a new geodesic on a newly deformed landscape.

The Back-Action Lemma:
Generically, the new period tau'_p of the system's orbit will not be equal to the old period tau_p. By applying perturbation theory to the variational problem from MATH-004, we can show that the change in the period is non-zero:

d(tau_p)/d(kappa) != 0

This is the formal proof of measurement back-action. The act of observing (kappa > 0) necessarily alters the fundamental rhythm of the observed system. The gaze of the observer forces the system to dance to a new beat.
