This section models the potential responsible for quark confinement as a direct application of the Γ-field's axiomatic properties.
Axiom (from PPS-035): The Gladiator Force (Γ) is a scalar field that mediates confinement.
Model: We can model the potential energy V(r) inside a baryon as the sum of a short-range repulsive term (derived from color force interactions, analogous to the r1​ term in QED) and a long-range linear confinement term provided by the Γ-field.V(r)=rαs​ℏc​+σr
Where:
αs​ is the strong coupling constant.
σ is the "string tension," which we propose is a direct function of the local Γ-field value: σ=f(Γ).
Analysis: This potential correctly describes the asymptotic freedom of quarks at very short distances (r→0) and their absolute confinement at larger distances (r→∞). The stability of the proton is found at the potential minimum. This model does not derive Γ; it uses the assumed existence of Γ to construct a potential that successfully explains an observed physical phenomenon. The strength of the confinement is therefore a measure of the local Γ-field's intensity.
