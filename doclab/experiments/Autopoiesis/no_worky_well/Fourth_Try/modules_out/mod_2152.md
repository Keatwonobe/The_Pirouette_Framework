To implement the analysis, the analyst uses three conceptual instruments. Each instrument is a structured rubric for quantifying one of the three signatures of coherence on a simple scale (e.g., 1-10, where 5 is average).

1. The Cohesion Gauge (Measures Rhythmic Cohesion):

Purpose: To quantify the efficiency and harmony of a team's execution.

Scoring Rubric (1-10):

1-3 (Dissonant): Frequent unforced errors, broken plays, visible frustration between players.

4-6 (Functional): Standard execution, plays run as designed but without exceptional flow, some hesitation.

7-8 (Harmonious): Crisp, efficient execution, players seem to be "in sync," complex plays look easy.

9-10 (Telepathic): A state of peak flow; improvisational, creative, and perfectly timed plays unfold, seemingly without effort.

2. The Resilience Meter (Measures Composure Under Pressure):

Purpose: To quantify a team's ability to absorb and recover from "dissonant injections" (mistakes, bad calls, opponent's big plays).

Scoring Rubric (1-10):

1-3 (Brittle): A single mistake consistently cascades into more errors; body language is defeated; team appears rattled.

4-6 (Standard): Recovers from errors at an average pace; may show frustration but resets for the next play.

7-8 (Tough): Actively "stops the bleeding" after a bad sequence; demonstrates short memory for mistakes; leadership is visible.

9-10 (Antifragile): Seems to use adversity as fuel; responds to an opponent's big play with an even better one; remains calm and focused in the most critical moments.

3. The Morphogenesis Index (Measures Strategic Adaptability):

Purpose: To quantify a team's ability to control the game's resonant pattern (Ki) and adapt its strategy.

Scoring Rubric (1-10):

1-3 (Rigid): Sticks to a single game plan even when it is failing; consistently out-coached and out-adjusted.

4-6 (Reactive): Makes adjustments, but often a step behind the opponent; follows the opponent's tempo.

7-8 (Proactive): Successfully imposes its will and tempo on the game; makes effective adjustments that neutralize the opponent's strengths.

9-10 (Visionary): Appears to be "playing chess" while the opponent is playing checkers; introduces novel strategies that the opponent cannot solve in time.
