The celebrated “challenge-skill” balance of Flow is the macroscopic experience of achieving equilibrium with Temporal Pressure.

| Component |	Pirouette Term | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Challenge | ΔT_env | The rate of novel temporal information presented by the environment. |
| Skill     | ΔT_agent | The agent's maximum bandwidth for coherently processing temporal information. |
| Flow      | Isochronism | ΔT_env = ΔT_agent → The agent's clock and the environment's clock tick in perfect time, minimizing turbulence and wasted energy. |

When this temporal equilibrium is met, the agent perceives the task as neither boring (challenge < skill) nor overwhelming (challenge > skill). The "work" of acting becomes as natural and effortless as breathing.
