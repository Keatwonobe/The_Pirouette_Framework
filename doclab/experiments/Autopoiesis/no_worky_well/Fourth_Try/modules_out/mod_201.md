P1 — Offset scaling
For equal‑mass mergers (M,M) near head‑on (b≪r_c):
Δx_max ≈ A(V)
· (v_in/2000 km s⁻¹)^{α} · (M/10^{15} M_⊙)^{β} · (1+z)^{γ}
with A,α,β,γ **fixed** once V(Γ) is frozen; no tunable cross‑section.

P2 — Survivability of κ peaks
Post‑pericenter, the Γ peaks re‑emerge with fractional mass retention f_ret(M,b,v_in) prescribed by the Γ halo binding; gas lags with an arc‑like shock.

P3 — Weak self‑interaction proxy
An apparent “σ/m” constraint inferred in CDM language maps in Pirouette to a **derived** (non‑tunable) effective collisional proxy σ_eff/m determined by Γ soliton overlap; prediction: σ_eff/m ≲ 0.2 cm² g⁻¹ for Bullet‑like events when V(Γ) is COSMO‑Γ‑000‑frozen.

Falsification:
• Required σ/m to match Δx exceeds σ_eff/m bound from the frozen V(Γ).
• κ peaks do not survive with observed strengths for real systems at given (M,b,v), contradicting f_ret predictions.
