The wisdom of the Weaver lies in recognizing the signs of a Coherence Dam long before it breaks and in applying the minimal force necessary to restore flow.

| **Pre-Fracture**  | Rising internal pressure (`V_Γ`) with no change in external form. Increasing resonant dissonance ("phase jitter"). | **Controlled Venting:** Introduce small, phase-matched channels to bleed off pressure (an "engineered spillway"). |
| **Onset**         | Rapid fragmentation of the `Ki` pattern. A cascade of secondary failures begins.                         | **Damage Channeling:** Establish pre-defined "sacrificial veins" to guide the turbulent release away from critical components. |
| **Post-Fracture** | The system is in a high-entropy, low-coherence state; it is exhausted and formless.                      | **Coherence Re-seeding:** Introduce a new, stable `Ki` pattern—a "tuning fork"—to provide a template for re-organization. |
