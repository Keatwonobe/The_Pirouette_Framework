The experimentally measured value of the electron's anomalous magnetic moment ($g-2$) can be derived from first principles within the Pirouette Framework. This derivation hinges on modeling the anomaly as the energetic correction arising from the self-interaction of the electron's `Wound Channel`, with the interaction strength governed by the calibrated value of $\\Gamma\_{electron}$.
