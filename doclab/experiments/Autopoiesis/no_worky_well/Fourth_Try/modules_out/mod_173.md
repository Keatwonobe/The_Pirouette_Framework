Targets (no further tuning):

1. fσ_8(z) curve at z ∈ {0.2…1.2}; report χ^2 vs. current RSD datasets.
2. Weak‑lensing S_8 ≡ σ_8 (Ω_m/0.3)^0.5 from Γ‑cosmology; compare to Planck prior and low‑z WL posteriors.
3. BAO distances (DV/r_s) across z bins using the same V(Γ).
4. Gravitational slip η(k,z) on linear scales (k ≲ 0.1 h/Mpc) with 1σ band.
5. c_GW = c bound satisfied by construction (record as a compliance line item).

Falsification conditions are met if any of the above require an extra fluid beyond Γ to match data at p<0.01 once systematics are accounted for.
