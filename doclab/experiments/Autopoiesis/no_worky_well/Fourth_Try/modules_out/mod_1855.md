This single dynamic gives rise to the universe's most fundamental structures.

-   **Baryons (Protons, Neutrons):** A baryon is a stable, three-body vortex. The three quarks are not connected by strings of force; they are three dancers in a perfectly synchronized, violent, and eternal pirouette, each tracing a path from which there is no coherent escape. The profound stability of the proton is the stability of this geometric knot.

-   **Mesons (Quark-Antiquark Pairs):** A meson is a two-body vortex, a simpler knot. The "mesonic pulse" described in the old model is the natural oscillation of this system as it traces its complex, resonant path. A particle confined within a vortex does not become static; to maintain maximal coherence, it must continuously trace its looping geodesic. This perpetual, periodic motion *is* the oscillation. The rhythm of the bound state is the rhythm of its geometric cage.
