The pre-condition for a Cascade is the formation of a **Coherence Reservoir**. This is a system that has achieved a state of very high internal coherence (Kτ) but is trapped in a local optimum on the coherence manifold. Diagnosed as a state of **Coherence Atrophy** or **Stagnant Flow** (DYNA-003), it is a system of immense potential energy confined by a steep gradient in the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) that acts as a "potential well" or a **Coherence Dam**. It is a coiled spring of possibility.
-   **Cosmology:** The pre-inflationary singularity, a state of immense density and order with nowhere to go.
-   **Biology:** The stable, but genetically rich, Ediacaran ecosystem before the spike in atmospheric oxygen changed the rules of the game.
-   **Cognition:** A mind steeped in a complex problem, holding numerous related concepts in a state of tense, unresolved suspension before a breakthrough.
