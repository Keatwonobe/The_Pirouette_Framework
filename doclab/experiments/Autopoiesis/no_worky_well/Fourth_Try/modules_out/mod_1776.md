The Geodesic Skate is a direct application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The propulsive "force" is not a force at all; it is the gradient of the Lagrangian itself, induced by the skater's internal modulations:

`F_skate ∝ -∇𝓛_p`

By actively manipulating the `K_τ` (Grip) and `V_Γ` (Glide) terms that constitute the local Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`), the skater is not applying an external force but is rewriting the equation of motion for its immediate vicinity. The resulting acceleration is the universe's only possible answer to the new geometry the skater has defined, as determined by the Euler-Lagrange equation. The motion is compulsory; it is the path of maximal coherence made manifest.

The passage of a skater leaves a distinct **Wound Channel** (`CORE-011`) in the coherence manifold—a geometric memory of its path. The structure of this wake is the skater's signature, an indelible record of its journey and the skill with which it was undertaken.
