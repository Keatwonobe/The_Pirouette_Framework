\section*{§10 · Outlook}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{XAP-006E} will treat the cosmological extension where $\mathcal{R}_\tau$ drives dark energy as residual stiffness.  
\item \textbf{Experimental prospect:} extremely small mass–curvature correlations may be observable in satellite-based interferometers or atomic clocks through minute time-dilation drifts correlated with field curvature.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!50!black,title={Summary}]
XAP-006D unites Γ-stiffness, Ki-fiber curvature, and temporal Ricci curvature into a single invariant determining all rest masses.  
Mass becomes not a property of matter but a measure of the curvature of time itself—closing the geometric circle begun with τ-isometries in XAP-005 and completing the Standard-Model correspondence of the Pirouette framework.
