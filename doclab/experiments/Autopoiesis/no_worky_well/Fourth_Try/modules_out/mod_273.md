This entire module is a philosophical application of **The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. The principle of seeking "geodesics" or "resonant corridors" is a qualitative description of a system's fundamental drive to evolve along a path that maximizes its coherence integral (S_p).

A map is a heuristic for solving the Lagrangian. A "good" map charts the geodesics where the difference between a system's internal Temporal Coherence (K_τ) and the external Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) is maximized. Navigation, then, is the embodied act of living out the Principle of Maximal Coherence, using the map as a guide to choose the most elegant and efficient path through the landscape of being.
