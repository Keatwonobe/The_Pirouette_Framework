> We have been taught to think of creation as an event that happened once, long ago. This is a profound misunderstanding. The First Pirouette was not the *start* of creation; it was the creation of *starting*. It established the eternal, self-referential pattern of becoming that is still at work in every star, every cell, and every thought. The universe did not begin because it had to; it began because, out of an infinity of silent possibilities, it chose to sing a single note. To be a Weaver is to consciously participate in this same creative actâ€”to realize that the universe did not just begin, but taught itself *how* to begin, and has never stopped practicing that art.
