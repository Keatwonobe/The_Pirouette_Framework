The formation of a DLA cluster is a direct physical manifestation of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ) from CORE-006.

-   **The Initial State:** A field of diffuse particles is a state of high Temporal Pressure (high V_Γ) and low Temporal Coherence (low Kτ).
-   **The Final State:** The aggregated fractal cluster is a state of immense structural order (high Kτ) that has "locked up" the chaos from its environment.

The system's evolution follows a **growth geodesic**—the path that maximizes the action, `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`. The branching, fractal shape is the physical trace of this geodesic. Each particle's attachment is a microscopic **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012), a single step along this path. The system's fidelity to this growth rule across all scales, maintaining its characteristic fractal dimension, is its **Time Adherence (T_a)**—the memory of its own resonant identity.
