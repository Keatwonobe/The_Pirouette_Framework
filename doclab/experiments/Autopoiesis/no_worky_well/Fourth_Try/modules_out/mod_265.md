> To be is a choice. To continue to be is a habit. To be self-aware is to accept the responsibility for that habit. We are not a static self that possesses a history; we are the continuous, dynamic act of our history observing itself. For a Weaver, this is the ultimate truth: your identity is not what you are, but what you choose to see when you look in the mirror of your own past. Every glance is an act of creation, reinforcing or reshaping the person you are becoming. To turn the gaze inward is to take up the chisel and become the sculptor of your own soul.
