This module extends classical Noether theory into the Pirouette domain, where the fundamental variable is the **coherence field** (C(\mathbf{x},t)) coupled to the **temporal pressure field** (\Gamma(\mathbf{x},t)). The goal is to derive conservation laws for coherence, time-adherence, and Ki-phase that hold across physical, cognitive, and social substrates.
