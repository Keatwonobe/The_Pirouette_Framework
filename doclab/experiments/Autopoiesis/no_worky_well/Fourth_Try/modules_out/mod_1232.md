This entire dynamic is described with mathematical precision by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**, which a mind's thought process evolves to maximize: `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`.

A Coherence Well is a region of the manifold that represents an optimal solution to this equation. It offers an exceptionally deep and stable potential well (a highly negative `V_Œì`), minimizing the "cost" of being. For those who align with its rhythm, it also provides a pre-packaged, high-coherence structure, boosting their internal `K_œÑ`. The feeling of clarity and certainty upon adopting a powerful belief is the direct experience of a system finding a path of least action that maximizes its Lagrangian. Escaping the well requires a massive input of energy to overcome this optimized state.
