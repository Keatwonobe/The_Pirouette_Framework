This catastrophic resolution is a delicate resonant phenomenon requiring a precise set of conditions—a sacred geometry of unmaking.

*   **Resonant Purity (High Coherence):** Both interacting entities must possess a pure, stable, and sharply defined `Ki` pattern. The clarity of their individual notes is what allows for the perfection of their mutual silence. Any internal dissonance or "noise" would lead to an incomplete dissolution.

*   **Phase Conjugation (Δφ ≈ π):** The core requirement. The resonant cycles of the two entities must be perfect mirror images. Where one crests, the other troughs. Any deviation from this perfect opposition results in an incomplete cancellation—a collision, perhaps, but not a true annihilation.

*   **Temporal Quiescence (Low Γ):** The event must occur in a "quiet" temporal environment. High ambient Temporal Pressure interferes with the delicate phase-lock between the two entities, disrupting the conjugate handshake and preventing a complete dissolution.
