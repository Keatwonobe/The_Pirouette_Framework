The time for pure derivation is over. This protocol specifies the single most important numerical experiment in the Pirouette Framework to date: The Grand Fit. We will take our complete theoretical model for the leptonic anomalous magnetic moment and confront it with the highest-precision experimental data in all of science. This is not a derivation; it is a measurement. We will use the observed muon anomaly to measure the free parameters of our theory, and then use those measured values to predict the electron anomaly, providing a sharp, falsifiable test. This is the moment we ask the universe, in its own language of numbers, if our map of its echoes is true.
