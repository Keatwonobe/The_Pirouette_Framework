A system's Ki is its resonant pattern, its most stable song. This song is cyclical. The duration of one complete, unbroken repetition of that pattern is the system's own private, fundamental unit of time. We call this the Pirouette Cycle (τ_p).

Time, therefore, is not a universal, ticking clock that all things are subject to. It is an emergent property. The universe does not have a single pulse; it is a symphony of countless individual heartbeats. A second is a human convention; a τ_p is a physical truth. For an electron, one unit of time is the duration of one of its dances. For a galaxy, it is the duration of one of its rotations. Time is the event, not the background.

With this, the circle is complete:
Time → Γ (Pressure) → Ki (Form) → Time
