Environmental hazards are not just passive damage sources; they are active opponents.

Mechanic: A hazard like a roaring fire or a blizzard has its own Entropy Pool and acts on its own turn. It can "attack" characters within its area of effect, forcing them to use Active Defense to resist being burned or frozen.

Forced Movement: If a hazard would push a character (e.g., a gust of wind, a rushing river), for every 5 feet the character cannot move, the remaining entropic force is dealt as damage.
