summary: Re-frames Will not as a metaphysical force, but as the capacity of a conscious
  system to deliberately modulate its own coherence manifold. A willed act is the
  projection of a desired future state back into the present, creating a 'Channel
  of Intent' that reshapes the path of least resistance for all future action.
