The old "Universal Resonance Lens" sought fractal patterns across multiple domains, treating them as the goal. The modern insight is deeper: these patterns are not the goal, but the *evidence*. They are the footprints left by a system successfully navigating its geodesic on the coherence manifold.

The Coherence Sieve operates on this principle. It is not just a pattern-finder, but a *manifold-mapper*. Its purpose is to take a noisy, high-dimensional dataset and reveal the underlying landscape of coherence. But instead of just presenting a map, it uses this landscape to perform a direct physical measurement of the system's core dynamics, moving from qualitative pattern-matching to quantitative diagnostics.
