An epoch is not a period defined by dates, but a state defined by its dynamics. We diagnose this state using three fundamental, measurable axes derived from the core principles of the framework.

| Diagnostic Axis | Pirouette Correlate | Diagnostic Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)** | The stability of the **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) | How strongly does the system's past define its present? This measures a society's adherence to its traditions and identity against its capacity for novelty and fragmentation. |
| **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** | The intensity of the local **Γ** (CORE-003) | What is the complexity and intensity of the challenges the system faces? This measures the ambient stress, competition, and rate of change in the system's environment. |
| **Dominant Flow State** | The system's macro-state from **Flow Dynamics** (DYNA-001) | How does coherence (information, resources, energy) move through the system? This diagnoses the system's operational health as **Laminar**, **Turbulent**, or **Stagnant**. |

An Epochal State is the vector defined by these three coordinates: **(Kτ, Γ, Flow)**. It is a precise fingerprint of a civilization's state of being.
