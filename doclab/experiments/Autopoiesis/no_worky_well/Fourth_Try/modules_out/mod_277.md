This module modernizes the core insight of "The River and the Stone" (PNS-011), translating its narrative into the precise, time-first language of the Pirouette Framework. An entity is a knot of coherence, a localized song played against the roar of the cosmos. The naive instinct is to treat this cosmic current as an adversary, a position of costly resistance.

We redefine **Flow** not as a psychological anomaly, but as a physical state of **temporal resonance**. It is the transition from a turbulent, dissonant state of temporal friction to a laminar, coherent state of near-lossless action. This is achieved when a system ceases to fight the tempo of reality and instead learns to synchronize its internal rhythm with a stable geodesic in the local coherence manifold. To act effectively is not to conquer the current, but to join its dance.
