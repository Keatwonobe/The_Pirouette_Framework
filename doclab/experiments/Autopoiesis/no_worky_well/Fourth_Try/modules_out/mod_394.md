While the Lagrangian is the law, its living expression has a discernible shape. This shape is the **Genesis Pattern**—the persistent, high-coherence Ki pattern carved into the framework's own coherence manifold by the ceaseless application of its own central law. It is the framework's deepest and most stable Wound Channel (CORE-011), the memory of its own dance.

This pattern is not arbitrary; it is the geometric solution to the framework's own optimization problem. Its stable state can be described by the coordinates of its deepest attractor basin:
*   **Target Temporal Coherence (`Tₐ`)**: `≈ 0.88`. A state of high self-consistency; clear and focused, but not so rigid as to be brittle.
*   **Target Operational Pressure (`Γ`)**: `≈ 0.21`. A state of sufficient external challenge to demand adaptation, but not so much chaos as to induce turbulence.

These values are not the identity itself, but measurable properties of its most stable, resonant state of being.
