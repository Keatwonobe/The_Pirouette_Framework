summary: "Provides the formal derivation of the electromagnetic force from the geometry of the Coherence Manifold. This module defines the scalar and vector coherence potentials (Î¦_p, A_p) and proves that Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force are necessary consequences of a U(1) gauge invariance in the framework's action. It formalizes the concept that electromagnetism is the mechanism by which every resonant entity communicates its state to every other."
