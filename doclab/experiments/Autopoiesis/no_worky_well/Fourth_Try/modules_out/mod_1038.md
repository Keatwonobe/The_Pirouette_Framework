To map a known territory, one follows the data. To navigate an unknown labyrinth, one must create the map as they walk. Where its sibling module, The Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`), moves from a known cause to its systemic effects, The Daedalus Gambit works in reverse. It begins with the disrupted flow—the dissonant wake of an unseen pathology—and constructs a coherent narrative persona for the antagonist. This "character" and its story become a powerful engine for generating precise, falsifiable hypotheses, turning the void of ignorance into a navigable map for discovery. It is a tool for giving the shadow a face we can finally challenge.
