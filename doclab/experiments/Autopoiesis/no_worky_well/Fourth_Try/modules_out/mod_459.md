Each entry in the Lexicon is a complete tool for thought and application. It consists of two parts:

1.  **The Definition:** A concise, time-first explanation of the concept, grounded in the core autopoietic cycle.
2.  **The Correspondence Protocol:** The evolution of the "operational cue." It is a single, potent question that acts as a universal lens. By asking this question of any system, a Weaver can pinpoint the specific manifestation of the universal concept, bridging theory to practice.

The following is a representative sample:

*   **Term:** Temporal Pressure (Γ)
    *   **Definition:** The measure of the complexity, density, and dissonance of interfering temporal rhythms in a given region of spacetime. It is the ambient chaos against which a system must maintain its form.
    *   **Correspondence Protocol:** Ask: *What is the ambient, chaotic pressure the system must resist or resolve to survive?*

*   **Term:** Temporal Resonance (Ki)
    *   **Definition:** The specific, stable, and efficient geometric pattern of resonance a system manifests to persist within a given Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the system's unique note in the song of existence.
    *   **Correspondence Protocol:** Ask: *What is the stable, repeating pattern of identity that defines this system's "self"?*

*   **Term:** Alchemical Union
    *   **Definition:** The non-linear process by which two or more resonant systems merge under pressure to form a single, higher-order entity with a unified and more complex coherence manifold.
    *   **Correspondence Protocol:** Ask: *What is the process of synthesis that allows separate parts to become a new, more coherent whole?*
