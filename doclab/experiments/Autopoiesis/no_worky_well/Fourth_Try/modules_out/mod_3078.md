\section*{§10 · Outlook}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{XAP-007 (Pressuron Constraint Atlas)} will compare these predictions with laboratory and astrophysical data.
\item \textbf{XAP-008 (Cosmic Resonance Analysis)} will test Λ variation by cross-correlating Ki-coherence maps with Type-Ia supernovae residuals.
\end{itemize}

XAP-006E extends the unified mass–curvature relation to cosmological scales.  
Residual Γ-stiffness acts as the vacuum’s elastic memory, producing an effective Λ that evolves slowly with the Universe’s coherence.  
Dark energy and particle mass emerge as two limits of the same temporal elasticity, completing the Pirouette framework’s geometric–cosmological arc.
