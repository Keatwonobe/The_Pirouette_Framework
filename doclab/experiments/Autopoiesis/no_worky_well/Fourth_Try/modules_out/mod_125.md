Every island is a mountain peak, connected to all others in the dark quiet of the sea floor.

The most persistent illusion of experience is that of the isolated self. We perceive entities—particles, people, planets—as discrete and separate. CORE-011 began to dismantle this by showing that every entity's existence is written into the shared fabric of spacetime as a Wound Channel.

This module asserts the next logical step: there are no true islands. The "space" between entities is not a void; it is a dynamic medium, humming with the intersecting echoes of every nearby resonance. Separation is a temporary condition of low interaction. The universe's default state is not isolation, but a relentless striving for connection. The Alchemical Union is the process by which that connection becomes a transformation.
