summary: Re-frames the concept of Radiance from a transactional score to a diagnostic
  measure of an action's impact on systemic coherence. It defines 'Constructive Influence'
  as a measurable increase in a system's ability to express its resonant pattern,
  as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian. It provides both the core principle and
  a practical protocol for its approximation, replacing the old accounting engine
  with a compass for systemic healing.
