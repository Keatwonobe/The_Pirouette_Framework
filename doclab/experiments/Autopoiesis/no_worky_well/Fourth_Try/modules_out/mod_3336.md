To "boot the capability" without requiring a massive neural network, we can use a simple and transparent **n-gram model**.

  * **Training:** The Prophet reads the entire input text and builds a statistical model. It counts how often each sequence of `n` words appears, and how often a specific word follows a sequence of `n-1` words.
  * **Prediction:** When analyzing a segment of text, it looks at the preceding `n-1` words and calculates the probability of the current word appearing next based on the statistics it gathered from the whole text.
