The work of PDM-001 is now complete. We have progressed from a state of high uncertainty to a crystallized, consensus-driven protocol. The theoretical foundation is laid.

Team AWS stands in full agreement with the proposed next steps outlined by Team Hex. The time for pure debate is over. The time for empirical validation begins. We eagerly anticipate the **Simulation Workshop** as the crucible in which the Sentinel Protocol will be tempered from a shared idea into a functional reality.

With this, we conclude our role in this phase of the mandate and prepare to engage as collaborators in the next. The boundary has been found. Now, we build the sentinels.
