The old notion of "Legitimacy" as alignment with fixed axes is now redefined in this dynamic context. The health and lawfulness of a system are measures of its navigational skill.

*   **A Lawful or Healthy System** is one that successfully navigates the manifold, staying on or near its geodesic. Its actions are efficient, its form is stable, and it exists in a state of high coherence. This is the state of **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001).

*   **A Chaotic or Unhealthy System** is one that fights the terrain of the manifold. Its Gyroscope wobbles, attempting to maintain a state dissonant with its environment. This results in a constant hemorrhage of coherence and wasted energy. This is the state of **Turbulent Flow**.

Responsibility and consequence are thus retained, but they are understood not as adherence to a static rulebook, but as the results of navigating a dynamic reality with skill and grace, or with dissonance and struggle.
