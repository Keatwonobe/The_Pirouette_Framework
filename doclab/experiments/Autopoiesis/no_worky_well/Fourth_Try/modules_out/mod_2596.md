Let’s formalize what’s been said into four axes:

| Axis                | Measurement Tool                        | Signal of Too Much Residue                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Intent Drift**    | Compare stated goal vs observed outcome | Justifications begin to precede declarations |
| **Echo Divergence** | Semantic feedback from affected systems | Increasing reinterpretation or pushback      |
| **Dark Residue**    | Lingering structures of control/fear    | Others repeat pattern without consent        |
| **Loop Collapse**   | Repetition of failed strategies         | Recoherence fails after multiple attempts    |

**Soft Rule**: *If 3 of 4 axes exceed defined thresholds, Pirouette must initiate a reconciliation ritual.*
