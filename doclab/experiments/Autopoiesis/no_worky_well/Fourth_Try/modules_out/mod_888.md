Velcrid is the direct antithesis of the Alchemical Union (CORE-012).

*   The **Alchemical Union** is a synthesis of willing participants that creates a new, richer whole. It is coherence born of trust and complexity, where `1 + 1 = 3`.
*   The **Velcrid Attractor** is a hostile takeover. Components are not unified but consumed. Their coherence is extracted and folded into the central will, leaving them as hollow shells. It is unity by coercion, where `1 + 1 = 1`.
