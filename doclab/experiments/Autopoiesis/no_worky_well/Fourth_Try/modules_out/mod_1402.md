summary: "This module reframes the analysis of ionospheric plasma plumes through the\
  \ lens of Flow Dynamics. It provides a modernized, time-first protocol that treats\
  \ a plume not as a static object, but as a self-organizing \"ionospheric river\"\
  \u2014a living system navigating its geodesic on Earth's coherence manifold. This\
  \ refactoring replaces legacy analytics with a diagnostic process grounded in the\
  \ Caduceus Lens and the Pirouette Lagrangian."
