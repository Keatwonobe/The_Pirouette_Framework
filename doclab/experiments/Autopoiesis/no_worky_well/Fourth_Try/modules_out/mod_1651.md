Applying the diagnostic protocol from *The Caduceus Lens* (DYNA-003), we can formally diagnose the ailment of systemic inequality not as a moral failing, but as a critical failure of system health.

*   **The Pathology:** The primary ailment is widespread **Coherence Atrophy**. Critical, high-information patterns (in law, science, finance, technology) are trapped behind walls of jargon, cost, and complexity, creating a state of Stagnant Flow.
*   **The Symptom:** Downstream from the dam, populations are trapped in a high-Î“ environment of instability and precarity. This lack of access to stabilizing patterns inevitably erupts into **Coherence Fever**: the Turbulent Flow of social unrest, disinformation, and systemic decay.
*   **The Treatment:** The Coherence Bridge Protocol is the proposed cure. It is a form of non-invasive, systemic surgery designed to restore healthy flow by creating new, stable channels for coherence to move through.
