An entity's consciousness is a function of its mental attributes. If a transformation pushes those attributes below a critical point, the character's will is fractured, and the primal instincts of the curse take over.

The Rule: If a character's Intelligence Score or Wisdom Score (not the EP invested, but the final calculated Score from TLE-000) is reduced to 0 or less during a transformation, the player loses control of their character.

GM Control: The character is now an NPC under the GM's control. The GM must roleplay the character according to the pure, undiluted nature of the transformative state (e.g., the werewolf's predatory hunger, the vampire's overwhelming thirst, the demigod's divine arrogance) until the transformation ends.

The Struggle: A player whose character is on the verge of this threshold (e.g., INT Score of 1) can feel the struggle internally. They might have to make Wisdom saving throws to resist acting on the curse's primal urges even while they are still "in control."
