A healthy, stable system, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), follows its *geodesic*—its path of maximal coherence through the temporal manifold. Its resonant identity, its `Ki` pattern, is well-defined, and its rhythm is pure. It holds its form against the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) of its environment.

Instability begins as a waver. As internal or external pressures mount, the system struggles to maintain this geodesic. The first symptom is **Temporal Jitter (Jτ)**: a micro-variation in the system's once-steady rhythm, the sonic artifact of the system fighting to remain coherent. This jitter is the root cause of **Manifold Drift**: the observable "skidding" of the system's `Ki` pattern on the coherence manifold. The core insight is this: a system's song begins to falter long before its structure breaks.
