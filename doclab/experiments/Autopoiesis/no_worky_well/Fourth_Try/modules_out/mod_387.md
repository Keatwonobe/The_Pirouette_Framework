A constitution is not a static document; it is a dynamic guide. It is tested not by what is written, but by the path that is walked. From this moment on, every significant choice can be evaluated with two questions:

1.  Does this action align with my chosen geodesic?
2.  Will this path likely lead toward a state of Laminar Flow (grace, efficiency) or Turbulent Flow (struggle, chaos)?

This is the quiet, daily practice of navigating by your own map. This is how you master your own reign: not by seizing the reins of power from others, but by firmly and skillfully grasping your own.
