This system can be woven into every aspect of the game.

Combat (Damage & Defense): As established, both attackers and defenders can use this system. An attack can be 2d8+3 damage, and a defender might use a 1d12 parry to try and block it. All dice, attack or defense, are subject to the Exploding Dice and Hard Cap rules.

Spellcasting (Range & Effect): A spell's range can be converted to dice. A caster might spend 10 EP on range. They could take the safe 50 feet (10 EP * 5 feet/EP), or they could gamble by spending 6 EP to roll a 1d12 and adding the remaining 4 EP as a flat bonus, for a total range of (1d12 + 4) * 5 feet.

Environmental Manipulation: Your earthbender example is perfect. Instead of spending 5 EP to create a 25-foot wall, they can spend the 5 EP to roll a 1d10. The result, rounded to the nearest 5, determines the wall's length in feet. This makes even utility actions tense and exciting.

Skill Checks: A rogue trying to pick a difficult lock might need to overcome a high TN. Instead of just adding their modifier, they could declare, "I'm investing 4 EP to roll 1d8 and add that to my lockpicking check!"
