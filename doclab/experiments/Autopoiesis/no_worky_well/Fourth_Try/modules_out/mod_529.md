The Coherence Deficit is the practical and indispensable counterpart to CORE-006. While the Pirouette Lagrangian provides the universal law, it is a template. The Deficit is the instrument we use to fill in that template for any specific system, making the core theory falsifiable, testable, and useful.

The integral of the Deficit over a system's cycle represents the total difference between the observed action (`S_obs`) and the predicted action (`Ŝ_pred`):

**∫ ΔK_τ(t) dt = S_obs − Ŝ_pred**

This value represents the total "lost" or "gained" potential of the system that the model could not explain. It is the universe's check engine light, signaling a critical and informative mismatch between our theory and reality.
