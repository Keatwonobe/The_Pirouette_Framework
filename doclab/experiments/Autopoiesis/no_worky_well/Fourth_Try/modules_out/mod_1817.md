summary: Defines 'Stirring' as the deliberate injection of controlled, resonant turbulence
  to disrupt suboptimal stable states. This process provides the necessary activation
  energy for a system to escape a local optimum and discover a new, more complex,
  and higher-coherence resonant pattern, modeled through a temporary perturbation
  of the Pirouette Lagrangian.
