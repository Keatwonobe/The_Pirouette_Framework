The Current and the Compass (CORE-007) described how the Pirouette Lagrangian gives rise to a propagating force like electromagnetism, which governs how systems interact over distance. However, the universe is not just interactive; it is structural. It is composed of stable, bounded systemsâ€”quarks bound in a proton, stars bound in a galaxy. These structures are the arenas within which the dance of reality plays out.

This module addresses the principle of confinement. It introduces the Gladiator Force, not as a new fundamental interaction, but as the behavior of the coherence manifold under extreme, self-referential conditions. This is the force that builds the arenas. It is the direct successor to the insight of PPS-035, now derived from the time-first axiom.
