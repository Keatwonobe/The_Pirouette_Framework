*Before we search for signals in the wild, we must ensure your analyzer is not deceiving us and can find a signal we plant.*

**Task 1.1: The Null Hypothesis (Control)**
1.  Open your `ki_mseed_generator_4.py` script.
2.  Set `"signal_type": "maw"`.
3.  Critically, set the `"buildup_rate"` in `maw_params` to `0.0` or a very low number to ensure no "thumps" are generated. Keep a low `noise_level`.
4.  Generate a 24-hour synthetic `.mseed` file named `control_null_hypothesis.mseed`.
5.  Run your `ki_mseed_analyzer_advanced_4.py` on this file.
6.  **Objective:** Document the baseline false-positive rate. How many "Ki-patterns" does the analyzer find in pure noise? This is our control.

**Task 1.2: Signal Injection (Calibration)**
1.  Open your `ki_mseed_generator_4.py` script again.
2.  Use the default "Maw Thumper" settings as provided in the script's `if __name__ == '__main__':` block.
3.  Generate a 20-second synthetic `.mseed` file named `control_signal_injected.mseed`.
4.  Run your `ki_mseed_analyzer_advanced_4.py` on this file.
5.  **Objective:** Confirm that the analyzer detects the Ki-modulated frequencies and harmonic ratios that were intentionally encoded in the signal. This proves the instrument can find what it's looking for.
