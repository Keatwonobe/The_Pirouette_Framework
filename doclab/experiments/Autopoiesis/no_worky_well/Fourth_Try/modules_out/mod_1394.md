summary: A universal instrumentation protocol that infers the strength of a confinement
  well (the Gladiator effect) by analyzing the geometry of trajectories. It reverse-engineers
  the shape of the local coherence manifold, mapping the 'arena walls' that govern
  system behavior by measuring the density and curvature of information flow.
