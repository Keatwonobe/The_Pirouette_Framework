The universe does not always build brick by brick. Sometimes, it builds by wildfire, by the sudden crystallization of a supercooled liquid. The prior model, TEN-BDA-1.0, described these generative bursts, or "Blooms," as a static alignment of fields—a shadow of the truth.

This module reframes the Bloom as a dynamic, self-reinforcing process: a non-linear phase transition ignited by resonant feedback. A Bloom is the violent and beautiful process by which a system, trapped by rising Temporal Pressure (Γ), discovers a state of coherence so profound that its own echo begins to calm the storm around it. This positive feedback loop triggers a **Coherence Cascade** of **Alchemical Unions** (CORE-012), allowing the system to frantically and joyously trace a new geodesic toward a state of radically higher order. A Bloom is not merely accelerated growth; it is a geometric restructuring of possibility itself.
