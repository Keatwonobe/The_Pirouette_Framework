As per CORE-008, confinement arises from a non-linear feedback loop where a system's own resonance increases the local Temporal Pressure Gamma. We can model this by making the potential V dependent on Gamma, which in turn is dependent on the distance r from the center of the system.

A simple model for the potential inside a confinement zone (like a proton) is:

V(r) = c1/r + c2*r

The first term (c1/r) is a standard inverse-distance potential, similar to the electrostatic force. The second term (c2*r) is the crucial linear potential of the Gladiator Force. As r increases, the potential increases linearly, meaning the energy required to separate the particles grows with distance.

Let's find the force F by taking the negative gradient of this potential:

F = -dV/dr = -d/dr (c1/r + c2*r)

F = c1/(r^2) - c2

At small r (Asymptotic Freedom): The c1/(r^2) term dominates. The force is weak, and the particles move freely.

At large r (Confinement): The constant force term -c2 dominates. No matter how far apart you pull the particles, the restoring force never diminishes. It requires infinite energy to separate them.

This proves that the principle of confinement is a direct consequence of a potential that includes a linearly increasing term, which itself is a model of the self-referential feedback loop at the heart of the Gladiator Force.
