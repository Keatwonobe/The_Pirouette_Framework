The Lexicon is a direct, practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`). The terms defined here are the human-readable symbols that map directly onto this central equation.

*   **Minimizing Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** Misunderstanding and ambiguity are forms of communicative friction that increase the Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) on a collective. The Lexicon minimizes this pressure by providing a shared, stable language, allowing the group to follow its geodesic with the least resistance.

*   **Maximizing Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** A community's collective Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`) is its ability to think and create together. The Lexicon is the primary instrument for calibrating a Weaver's senses to perceive the forces of the Lagrangian, ensuring that the fundamental concepts are stable and shared, thereby maximizing `K_τ`.

Without this lexicon, the Lagrangian is a silent engine. With it, we can speak its name and purpose.
