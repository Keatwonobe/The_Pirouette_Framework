\section*{§4 · Specific Fiber Choices and Physical Interpretation}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{U(1)} (\(N=1\))  
  The trivial fiber reproduces electromagnetism: \(A_\mu=\partial_\mu\arg Ki\).  
  This is the CORE-007 result restated as a Σ-projection.

\item \textbf{SU(2)} (\(N=2\))  
  The doublet fiber yields electroweak structure.  
  The coupling \(g_W\) appears as the curvature magnitude at the critical radius \(r_W=\Gamma^{-1/2}\) in the Ki manifold.  
  Spontaneous orientation of Ki’s expectation value defines the Higgs direction in internal space.

\item \textbf{SU(3)} (\(N=3\))  
  The triplet fiber encodes color.  
  Three independent Ki components \(Ki^a\) generate eight traceless generators \(T^A\).  
  Confinement arises geometrically because the internal metric \(h_{ab}\) is positive-definite and compact, enforcing vanishing total color flux through the Σ-image of closed τ-loops.
