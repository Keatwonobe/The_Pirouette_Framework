The state of a system's memory can be classified by the interplay between its internal coherence and the external temporal pressure it endures.

| Phase | Description | Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) | Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) | Archetype |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Echo** | The dynamic, fluid Wound Channel of recent events. | Medium | High | Short-term recall, a conversation |
| **Crystal** | The stable, static, locked Information Lattice. | Very High | Very Low | DNA, a diamond, deep-seated dogma |
| **Scar** | A damaged, corrupted lattice; a crystal shattered but not melted. | Low | Low | Trauma, corrupted data, a ruin |
| **Noise** | A disorganized, fleeting cloud of information and potential. | Very Low | Very High | A dream, brainstorming, psychosis |
