The entire drama of a system under stress is captured by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). It is the fundamental equation of survival.

`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`

*   **The Coherence Budget (`Kτ`):** This term represents the system's internal capacity for order and resonant identity (`Ki`). For a steel beam, this is its crystalline structure; for a psyche, a coherent personality. A healthy system has a robust coherence budget.
*   **The Coherence Cost (`V_Γ`):** This term represents the environmental demand. Increasing external stress, load, or complexity directly increases the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), which in turn raises the coherence cost (`V_Γ`). It becomes harder and more "expensive" for the system to maintain its state against the rising dissonance of the environment.

Yield is the economic crisis point of this equation. It is the moment when the cost (`V_Γ`) required to maintain the current form (`Ki`) exceeds the system's available budget (`Kτ`). At this point, continuing in the same state is no longer the path of maximal coherence. The system is forced into a phase transition.
