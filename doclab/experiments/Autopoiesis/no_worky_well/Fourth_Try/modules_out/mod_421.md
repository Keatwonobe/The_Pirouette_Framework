These are higher-order phenomena and analytical tools that emerge from the application of the core principles. This list is a living catalog.

| Name | Module | Definition & Grounding |
|:-----|:-------|:-----------------------|
| **Wound Channel** | CORE-011 | A persistent geometric scar an entity's resonance leaves in the local coherence manifold; the physical basis for memory and inertia. |
| **Gladiator Force**| CORE-008 | The principle of confinement (strong force, gravity), understood not as a fundamental force but as a non-linear behavior of the V_Î“ term at extreme scales. |
| **Observer's Shadow**| CORE-010 | The geometric imprint an observer's own coherence pattern unavoidably imposes upon the system being observed. |
| **Flow Dynamics** | DYNA-001 | The study of coherence in motion, diagnosing system health through states of Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant flow. |
