1. Symmetry & Scaling Axioms
   A1 Shift/Galilean symmetry: θ → θ + const; ψ=√n e^{iθ} with nonrelativistic kinematics.
   A2 Scale covariance (nonrelativistic Lifshitz): (t,x) → (λ^z t, λ x); action S=∫ dt d^dx P(X) is invariant up to a boundary term.
   A3 Coherence network: mass/energy flows along a D_eff‑dimensional subset of space (sheets/filaments/points), a coarse‑grained representation of “wound channels.” D_eff may be non‑integer (fractal) but in practice organizes into plateaus {0,1,2} across scales.

X scaling
Let θ be dimensionless; dominant term in X scales as θ̇ ⇒ [X] → λ^{−z}. Under (t,x) scaling the measure scales as λ^{d+z}. Requiring S invariant gives
(d+z) − (1+β) z − D_boundary = 0.
For local P(X) (no boundary anomaly) this yields
1+β = (d+z)/z ⇒ β = d/z.
Replacing the bulk dimension d with the **active** dimension D_eff (the measure of the coherence network actually sourcing X) gives
β = D_eff / z.  (Eq. 1)

Interpretation
• z encodes dynamics (e.g., z=2 for superfluid hydrodynamics).
• D_eff encodes geometry/topology (sheet‑like D_eff≈2; filamentary D_eff≈1; point‑like cores D_eff≈0).
• Discrete self‑similarity of the network yields **plateaus** in D_eff and hence **rational β**.
