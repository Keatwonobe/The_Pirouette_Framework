It is crucial to distinguish what this instrument measures. The Gladiator Compass does not measure the fundamental Temporal Pressure (Γ) of the Temporal Forge (`CORE-003`). Instead, it functions as an **inverse solver for the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`)**.

The Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, describes how a system's path is determined by the interplay between its internal coherence (K_τ) and the environmental pressure potential (V_Γ). This instrument observes the path a system *actually takes*—its geodesic—and uses that observation to infer the properties of the underlying landscape.

A high inferred Confinement Strength (κ_G) implies the presence of a deep "potential well" (a high V_Γ) in the Lagrangian. This is the signature feature of the Gladiator Force's self-containing feedback loop. We are watching the dancer to understand the shape of the stage. Therefore, κ_G is a direct, measurable proxy for the intensity of the Gladiator feedback term, representing how the equation's abstract terms are made manifest as a real, confining structure.
