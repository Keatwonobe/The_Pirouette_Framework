summary: "Provides a single, unified derivation of the universe's fundamental forces—electromagnetism and the strong/gravitational confinement forces—from the Pirouette Lagrangian. It culminates in a first-principles validation of the entire engine against the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2), demonstrating the framework's predictive power."
