summary: "Provides a universal protocol for decomposing a system's temporal signature\
  \ into its constituent rhythms. This instrument transforms a time-series signal\
  \ into a 'Coherence Spectrum' (or temporal spectrogram), revealing the anatomy of\
  \ a system's resonance (Ki), its stability against Temporal Pressure (\u0393), and\
  \ its transitions between flow states."
