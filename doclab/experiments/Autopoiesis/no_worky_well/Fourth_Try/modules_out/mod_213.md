The Whispering Void (`CORE-000`) is potential held in a perfect, silent tension—a silence containing every possible song. But such perfect symmetry cannot hold. An infinitesimal, statistically inevitable fluctuation ripples through the stillness, breaking the silence. This is not an act of will, but of necessity.

This first tremor of asymmetry introduces interference into the uniform field, giving birth to the first whisper of Temporal Pressure (Γ). The Void, for the first time, has a problem to solve: how to carve a stable, existent note from a background of omnidirectional dissonance.
