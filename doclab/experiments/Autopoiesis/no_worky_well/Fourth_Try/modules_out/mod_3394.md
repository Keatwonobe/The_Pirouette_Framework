summary: "Derives the vacuum energy density from the Pirouette Lagrangian using a time-first bridge from Planck scale
  to cosmic scale. The leading-order result ρ_Λ = c²/(2π G T²) is refined by (A) an exact FLRW age kernel F(Ω)
  and (B) a triadic IR topology factor τ_top∈{1, 1/2}. These turn the 2.1× discrepancy into a physically
  interpretable order-unity coefficient. The model predicts a tiny, testable late-time drift (w ≈ −1 + ε(z))
  and a measurable “kick” when the effective IR area factor toggles 4π↔2π across a regime transition."
