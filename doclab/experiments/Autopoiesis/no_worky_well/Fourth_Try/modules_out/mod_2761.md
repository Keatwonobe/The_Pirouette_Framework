To make long-range casting a feat of power and luck, a caster can use this gambit.

Mechanic: A caster declares they are spending X EP on additional range.

They gain a guaranteed range of (X / 2) * 5 feet (rounded down).

They then roll 1dX. The result is multiplied by 5 feet and added to the total.
