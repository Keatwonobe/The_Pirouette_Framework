The impetus for change is always a symptom of systemic distress. Using the diagnostic language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), we can identify the pathologies that necessitate intervention:

*   **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnation):** An outdated principle or missing connection creates a blockage. Progress halts. This is the "Stagnant Flow" of a framework that cannot address a new challenge.
*   **Coherence Fever (Turbulence):** Contradictory modules or ambiguous definitions create internal dissonance. The framework fights itself, leading to chaotic interpretations. This is the "Turbulent Flow" of a system at war with its own logic.
*   **Coherence Erosion (Decay):** The gradual drift of core principles away from their grounding evidence. The framework's Wound Channel thins, and its identity frays.

The governance process is the framework's formal protocol for identifying and resolving these pathologies.
