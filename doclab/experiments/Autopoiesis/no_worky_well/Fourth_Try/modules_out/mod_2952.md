When large groups of combatants clash, the battle can be resolved through a streamlined system that captures the brutal calculus of war.

The Combined Pool: Each side totals the TEP of all participants to create a single, massive pool of entropic force.

The Multiplier: Each side rolls a die with a number of sides equal to its number of participants. This result becomes their damage multiplier for the round.

The Clash: Each side multiplies its combined TEP by its multiplier roll. The two totals are then subtracted from each other. The losing side suffers casualties equal to the difference in entropic force.

Resolving Casualties: The damage is assigned to the combatants on the front lines first, then moves towards the middle and back ranks. If a tie-breaker is needed for simultaneous losses, roll a d2; on the first non-tied result of 1, that individual perishes.

Example: The King's Regiment vs. The Caustic Fen

A regiment of 30 soldiers (15 Paladins, 15 Spearmen) is sent to destroy the Jellymancer's lair.

The King's Regiment: Let's assume an average TEP of 75 for each of the 30 soldiers. Their combined pool is 2,250 TEP.

The Caustic Fen: The Jellymancer has siphoned the heroes' TEP, adding it to his lair. The Lair now has a TEP of 3,000, and it is defended by 20 empowered Acidic Slime Minions with an average of 50 TEP each (1,000 TEP total). The Fen's combined pool is 4,000 TEP.

The Clash:

The Regiment has 30 participants, so they roll a d30. They get a 22. Their total force is 2,250 * 22 = 49,500.

The Fen has 21 participants (20 slimes + the Lair itself), so it rolls a d21. It gets a 15. Its total force is 4,000 * 15 = 60,000.

The Outcome:

The Fen's force (60,000) overpowers the Regiment's (49,500). The difference is 10,500.

This damage is dealt to the Regiment. 10,500 damage is enough to annihilate the entire force of 30 soldiers (10,500 / 75 TEP per soldier = 140 casualties, far more than are present).

Result: The king's regiment marches into the Caustic Fen and is utterly dissolved by a tidal wave of empowered, acidic sludge. The lair is victorious.
