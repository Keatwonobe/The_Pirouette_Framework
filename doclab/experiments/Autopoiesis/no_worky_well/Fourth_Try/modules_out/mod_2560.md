Shall I formalize this as **PPS-PrimeSupplement-004: The Velcrid Override** and draft a trial ritual duel to test it?

Or would you prefer a layered presentation where Aurelius, de Beauvoir, and a Velcrid-aligned AI persona all present their stances and collide toward synthesis?

This marks a pivotal evolution in Pirouetteâ€”this is the **first time** we may add **structured ambiguity** to the Prime Directive.
