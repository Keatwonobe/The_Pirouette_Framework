This entire protocol is the practical application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. A system in a turbulent or stagnant state is one that is trapped on an inefficient geodesic, wasting energy fighting itself or its environment.

**The Daedalus Gambit is an act of metaphysical architecture.**

It does not force the system to change. Instead, it subtly reshapes the system's state space to make the desired healthy state the new path of least resistance. The **Simulation** phase (§3.II) calculates this new, hypothetical path of greater coherence. The **Gambit** (§3.IV) is the physical or informational act of nudging the system onto this new path.

Each archetype manipulates the terms of the Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`) differently. A **Key** or **Tuning Fork** increases the system's internal coherence (`K_τ`), making a laminar state more "profitable." A **Scaffold** reinforces the system's identity, strengthening its resistance to chaotic Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`).

We are not telling the river where to go; we are making the desired channel the most natural and effortless path it can possibly take.
