A character's actions have consequences. Their standing with the major factions of the bottom realm is tracked on a simple scale from -5 (Hated) to +5 (Revered).

The Cities (e.g., The Endeavor)

Reputation: Gained by completing quests for city leaders, protecting trade routes, and upholding the law. Lost by committing crimes and associating with nomads.

+5 (Revered): You are a hero of the city. You are granted a permanent residence and a say in political matters.

-5 (Hated): You are exiled and hunted. A bounty is placed on your head, and city guards will attack you on sight.

The Nomad Camps

Reputation: Gained by trading fairly, sharing intelligence, and raiding city-aligned targets. Lost by betraying their trust or siding with city law.

+5 (Revered): You are considered one of their own. You are given access to their black markets, secret routes, and can call on them for aid.

-5 (Hated): You are a primary target. Nomad raiding parties will actively hunt you through the wastes.

The Lepi

Reputation: Gained only through acts of profound respect, fair trade, and by protecting their neutrality. Lost by acts of aggression, disrespect, or by trying to force them to break their neutrality.

+5 (Revered): You are a trusted friend. The Lepi will grant you safe passage through the most dangerous territories and may even share intelligence on the Skazan Order.

-5 (Hated): You are shunned. The Lepi will refuse to trade or speak with you, effectively cutting you off from the realm's most knowledgeable guides.

The Skazan Order (Threat Meter)

This is not a reputation, but a Threat Level, starting at 0 and increasing. It is raised by accumulating TEP, defeating their agents, and interfering with their plans.

Threat 1-5: Your handler watches from a distance, occasionally sending minor obstacles your way to "fatten you up."

Threat 6-10: Your handler begins to take a more active role, hiring bandits or manipulating beasts to test your limits.

Threat 11+: You are no longer just an investment; you are a problem. The Skazan will dispatch powerful, specialized agents with the sole purpose of harvesting you by any means necessary.
