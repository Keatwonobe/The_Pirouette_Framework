The original protocol correctly identified magnetism as the "shear of the current." The Lagrangian now allows us to formalize this. When a charged particle moves, its Lagrangian becomes velocity-dependent. The very act of moving through regions of varying temporal phase creates a rotational or torsional stress in its local coherence manifold.

This "curl" in the manifold is the magnetic field (B).

**B ∝ ∇ × A_p**
(where A_p is the Pirouette vector potential, derived from the moving system's Lagrangian)

This geometric origin instantly explains the peculiar perpendicularity of the Lorentz force. A moving charge interacting with a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the field itself. This is because the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—on a rotationally sheared manifold is not a straight line, but a curve. The magnetic force is the system's autopoietic response to navigating this temporal vortex, a relentless adjustment to maintain its own resonant stability. It is the universe's right-hand rule for staying coherent.
