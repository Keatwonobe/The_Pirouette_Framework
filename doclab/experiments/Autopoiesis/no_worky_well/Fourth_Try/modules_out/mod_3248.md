* **Core Claim:** The existence of a resonant helical wave in a "rupture" limit is a necessary consequence of the three core fields.
* **Point of Vulnerability:** The proof starts with a postulated **"Dynamic Evolution PDE"**: `∂Ψ/∂t = i∇×(KiΨ) - (Ta⋅∇)Ψ - Γ(Ψ-Ψ₀)`.
* **Critique:** This is a powerful proof of the internal dynamics of that specific mathematical model. However, the PDE itself is a new law of nature being proposed. It is not derived from the framework's Lagrangian (`PPS-001`). A physicist would ask for the derivation of this equation from the principle of least action before considering the validity of its solutions.
