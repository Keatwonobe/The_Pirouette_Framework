§§§ Mapping beauty to low-k spectral coherence and harmony to resonant complexity (Tₐ, Γ, Kᵢ) assumes these metrics capture aesthetic value across contexts. Yet fractal datasets show that high coherence can coincide with entropy traps and brittle structures. Without cross-domain validation, these proxies remain arbitrary and vulnerable to manipulation :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
