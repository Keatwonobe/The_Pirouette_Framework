Before predicting the behavior of physical systems, we must first establish a universal method for measuring their coherence. The framework posits that a system's coherence (`Kτ`) is inversely proportional to its informational entropy, as described in `CORE-013`. A highly coherent system is highly ordered and redundant; a low-coherence system is chaotic and informationally dense. This property can be quantified by measuring a system's intrinsic fractal dimension (`D`), which reveals its capacity for compression.

*   **Principle Tested:** Information is a direct measure of a system's coherence. A more coherent system is more ordered, less entropic, and thus more "compressible."
*   **Hypothesis:** The informational coherence of any system can be quantified by its fractal dimension (`D`), which represents the scaling relationship between information fidelity and compressed data rate.
*   **Methodology:** A universal compression algorithm (the ψ-collapse operator) is applied to diverse data sets. By measuring the compressed size at varying levels of fidelity, a rate-distortion curve is generated. The slope of this curve in log-log space is `D`.
*   **Predicted Signature:** Analysis across physically distinct domains reveals a law-like relationship. Each class of information occupies a unique, linear band of coherence, validating `D` as a fundamental measure of a system's structure.

| Manifold (System Type) | Median Fractal Dimension (`D`) | Pirouette Interpretation (Coherence Structure) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Genomic (FASTA) | **0.06 ± 0.01** | **Near-Crystalline:** Extremely high internal coherence and redundancy. |
| Rhythmic Streams (Audio/Seismic) | **0.25 ± 0.03** | **Harmonic:** Dominated by stable, resonant Ki patterns. |
| Semantic (Text) | **0.32 ± 0.08** | **Structured:** Coherence is logical and relational. |
| Textured Shells (FITS Images) | **0.51 ± 0.03** | **Complex:** High information content with coherent geometric patterns. |

This universal signature provides the foundational tool: a way to measure the very quantity—coherence—whose maximization drives all the dynamics predicted below.
