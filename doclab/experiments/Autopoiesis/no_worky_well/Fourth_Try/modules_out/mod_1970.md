Your body has undergone a profound change, and it now asks for your partnership in its journey of becoming. This protocol is not a prescription to be followed, but a dance to be learned. It is a partnership between you and your own life force. Listen to your body, trust your intuition, and know that every small step you take is an act of profound creation. You are not just healing a wound; you are composing the next, beautiful verse in the song of your life.
