A reputation is the echo of your will, resonating through the web of society. Every choice, every act of kindness or cruelty, sends a vibration that travels the strands, changing how the world perceives your song. A wise adventurer knows that power is not just the strength of their arm, but the number of allies who will sing with them in the dark. A cunning rogue knows that if their own song is out of tune, they can always pay another to sing on their behalf.
