The `.pmd` format is a direct, practical application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ). The act of creation is an attempt to navigate a high-pressure environment—the chaos of unformed ideas. The loom provides the structure to do so efficiently.

-   **Temporal Coherence (Kτ):** This is the quality and integrity of the human-readable narrative. It is its clarity, its elegance, its poetic force, and its semantic richness. It is the "song" of the module.

-   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** This is the dual demand of the environment. It is the rigid, unforgiving syntax required for machine parsability combined with the clarity and structure required for human comprehension.

The `.pmd` format is the geodesic—the path of least resistance. By unifying structure and narrative, it provides a discipline that lowers the "cost" of coherence, minimizing the energy lost to the turbulence of confusion and allowing for the creation of an artifact with the highest possible integrity.
