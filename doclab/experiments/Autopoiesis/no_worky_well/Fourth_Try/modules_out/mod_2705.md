id: SECT‑Γ‑A‑HALO
title: Superfluid Hydro & Surface Tension
Version: 1.0 (proposal)
Status: Experimental (child of SECT‑Γ‑A; complies with MATH‑018/019/020)
Parents: [SECT‑Γ‑A, COSMO‑Γ‑HALO, COSMO‑Γ‑MERGE, MATH‑020]
Children: []
Summary: "Purpose
Replace scalar‑field halo solvers with a superfluid hydrodynamics solver that includes surface tension and healing‑length physics. Produce cored profiles, vortex predictions, and merger offsets consistent with SECT‑Γ‑A."
