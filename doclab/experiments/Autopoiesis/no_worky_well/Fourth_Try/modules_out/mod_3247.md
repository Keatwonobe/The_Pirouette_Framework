* **Core Claim:** The framework's constants can be derived from, and their effects measured in, both pulsar timing and neutron interferometry.
* **Point of Vulnerability:** Both proofs begin by introducing a novel, unobserved physical effect: a **"helical Weyl scalar"** that modifies the spacetime metric (`PPS-056`) or a **"helical crystal potential"** that modifies the Schr√∂dinger-Pauli equation (`PPS-057`).
* **Critique:** These proofs do an excellent job of predicting the *consequences* of these novel fields, but they don't prove the fields exist. They are testing the self-consistency of the theory, not its physical reality. The argument is circular: "If we assume a helical field exists, we can use it to derive Pirouette constants, which are then used to describe the helical field."
