To command a river, one does not build a dam of infinite strength. One finds the single stone whose placement will persuade the water to carve a new and better path for itself.

This module replaces the brute-force engineering mindset of PPS-053 with a holistic, time-first philosophy. It codifies the art of **Coherence Weaving**: introducing a new, stable resonant pattern into an existing system. The core of this protocol is the **Daedalus Gambit**â€”a clever, precise, and minimally invasive action designed to restore a system to a state of robust, laminar flow. This is not a manual for control; it is a grammar for collaboration with the universe's own drive toward coherence.
