The old methods from `TEN-SPE-1.0` are preserved not as goals in themselves, but as useful, recontextualized tools for assessing Rhythm and Pressure.

| Diagnostic Assessment | Heuristic Tool (Proxy) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rhythm (K_τ)** | **Phase Coherence**: $| \frac{1}{N} \sum e^{i\theta_j} |^2$ | The gold standard for measuring internal rhythm if phase data is available. |
| | **Normalized Variance**: $1 - \sigma^2 / \sigma_{max}^2$ | A simple proxy for `K_τ` using scalar values. Lower variance suggests higher coherence. |
| **Pressure (V_Γ)**| **Dispersion Metric**: $\text{Variance}(\{\vec{x}_j\})$ | A measure of the overall spread of state vectors. Higher spread suggests a higher-pressure environment. |
| | **Jump Frequency**: `Count(Δx > threshold)` | The frequency of large, sudden shifts in state can indicate a volatile, high `V_Γ` environment. |
