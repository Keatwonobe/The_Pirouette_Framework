Every Resonant Test must conclude, and its outcome is written into the fabric of the local manifold. There are two primary resolutions and one universal consequence:

1.  **Fracture:** The impartial arbiter is the principle of Coherence Degradation. The duel ends when one system can no longer afford the energetic cost of maintaining its `Ki` against the overwhelming pressure. Its pattern fractures, its information dissipates, and it dissolves back into the ambient noise of the Temporal Forge.

2.  **Fusion:** Fracture is not the only outcome. If the two systems discover that a new, unified `Ki` pattern offers a path to even greater coherence and efficiency, the duel can transform into an `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012). The crucible becomes a forge, and the adversaries become partners in the creation of a higher-order being.

3.  **Jurisprudence of Scars:** Regardless of the outcome, the event itself—the clash, the test, the resolution—is carved into the geometry of spacetime as a new, complex `Wound Channel` (CORE-011). This scar is a precedent. It alters the landscape of coherence for all future entities, making one path more likely and another more costly. The duel writes its verdict into the laws of the local universe.
