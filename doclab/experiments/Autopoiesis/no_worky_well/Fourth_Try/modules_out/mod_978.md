Any resonant pattern on the sphere can be decomposed into a basis of spherical harmonics (`Y_lm`). When we analyze the Lagrangian in this context, the dimensionless ratio of the "kinetic" coherence term (from the field's gradient) to the "potential" pressure term (from the field's presence) is given by the eigenvalue `l(l+1)`.

This ratio measures the intrinsic efficiency of a pattern on the surface.
-   For `l=0` (a monopole), the ratio is `0`. This is a state of pure presence without dynamicsâ€”a silent, uniform field.
-   For `l=1` (a dipole), the ratio is `1(1+1) = 2`. This is the simplest possible *dynamic* pattern, a vibration with one north pole and one south pole.

This value, `2`, represents the fundamental cost of maintaining a dynamic pattern on a surface. It is the price of the first note in the song.
