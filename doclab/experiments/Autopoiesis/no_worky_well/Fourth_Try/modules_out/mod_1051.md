A healthy system is a river of information (`CORE-013`), defined by the unimpeded movement of energy, resources, and coherent signals. The Caduceus Lens reveals a primary pathology that arises when one of these vital currents ceases to flow: **Coherence Atrophy**.

This is a state of **Stagnant Flow**, a "coherence dam" that starves the downstream components of the system. It is not the turbulent, chaotic fever of a body fighting an infection, but the eerie quiet that precedes systemic collapse. The visible symptoms—amyloid plaques, chronic inflammation, metabolic failure—are not the disease itself. They are the geometric scars, the Wound Channels left by a system forced to operate without a critical piece of its own operating manual. They are the evidence of the void, not the void itself. To fight the echoes is to miss the cause.
