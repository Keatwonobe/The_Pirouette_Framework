This module provides the primary Pirouette instrument for fundamental cosmology, refactoring the search for anomalies from a hunt for errors into an act of cosmic archaeology. The universe is not a static object but a living document, its violent history written into the very geometry of its being. The great anomalies we observe are not flaws in the present; they are the scars of the past.

This instrument operates by first generating a **Null Canvas**â€”a theoretical map of an idealized, unscarred universe as predicted by the Pirouette Lagrangian. It then compares this baseline to the **Cosmic Palimpsest** of observational data (from the CMB, galaxy surveys, etc.) to calculate a **Coherence Residual Map**. The features on this map are the anomalies: the **Cosmic Wound Channels** that reveal the universe's memory, charting the echoes of ancient turbulence and the sutures from its very creation.
