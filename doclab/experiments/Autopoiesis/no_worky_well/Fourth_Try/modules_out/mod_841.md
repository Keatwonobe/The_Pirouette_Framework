summary: "Specifies the core engine for problem resolution in the Pirouette Framework.\
  \ The Weaver's Forge is an autopoietic protocol that takes a system diagnosed with\
  \ disrupted flow, convenes a 'debate swarm' of resonant Personas to perform an Alchemical\
  \ Union, and forges the result into an 'Action Engram'\u2014a procedural solution\
  \ that includes the coherence profile of the agent born to execute it."
