summary: Establishes the foundational, two-channel diagnostic lens for the Pirouette
  Framework, refactoring the legacy Drift/Song protocol into a direct application
  of the Pirouette Lagrangian. It maps the Lagrangian's kinetic (Resonance) and potential
  (Pressure) terms into a practical instrument for strategic attention. This module
  defines a tiered audit standard, enabling a Weaver to move from efficient, continuous
  scanning to deep, forensic analysis with precision and purpose.
