- Born of a Dream
Among some ancient and fey-touched lineages, new life is not conceived but discovered. An Elven dream priestess might walk the ethereal pathways of a sleeping mind and find, within a particularly innocent or powerful dream, a nascent soul. With gentle care, she can coax this dream-stuff into the waking world, where it coalesces into a new child, its first cries still echoing with the logic of slumber.

- Carved from the Earth
For beings deeply connected to the bones of the world, creation is an act of craft. Gnomish parents, for example, might spend years carving the perfect vessel for their child from a block of ancient wood or a sacred geode. When the form is complete, they perform a ritual to invite a spirit to inhabit it, and the carved figure awakens with the sturdiness of stone and the slow, deep wisdom of the earth.

- Forged by Nature
Some of the most powerful beings are not born of other beings at all, but are direct manifestations of the world's raw, chaotic power. A Giant might be born when a volcano rages, its body forming from a boulder of cooling magma. A roaring thunderstorm might birth a Storm Giant from a hailstone of impossible size that crashes to the earth. These beings are not children in the traditional sense, but living embodiments of a moment of profound natural force.

- Uplifted from the Wild
The bond between a druid and the natural world is so deep that it can transcend the boundaries of species. A druidic couple might find a young animal whose parents have perished. Through a powerful ritual of uplift, they can invest a portion of their own will and entropic potential into the creature, granting it sapience and a humanoid form. This child is raised with the instincts of the wild and the loving guidance of its chosen family.

- Willed into Being
In places rich with entropic residue or deep emotional resonance, life can arise spontaneously. An Etceteron—a being made of miscellaneous scraps of glass, cloth, and forgotten things—might be carefully assembled by a lonely soul who needs a friend. Or, it might pull itself from a junk heap, a consciousness born from the lingering memories and chaotic energy of a thousand discarded objects, achieving a life of its own.

- The Primal Font
For some elemental spirits, the source of new life is a finite and precious resource. Water Sprites of a particular glen might vie for control of a sacred spring that, once a year, seeps a single droplet of primal, life-giving liquid. The sprite who claims this droplet can use it to sculpt a new member of their kind, making the act of procreation a yearly contest of skill, cunning, or combat.

- The Dragon's Riddle
The origin of dragons is a paradox. Some are hatched from eggs of gemstone or metal laid by a great matriarch. Others are said to be "raised" from mundane lizards or serpents by an elder dragon's will. Still others are believed to be carved from a single, flawless gem and animated by a ritual that costs the lives of a dozen mages. The dragons themselves remain silent on which story is true, adding another layer to their mystique.
