* **Precursor Oscillation:** (\Theta(t)) exhibits rising low-frequency variance preceding social shocks.
* **Cross-Scale Locking:** (\Theta) stabilizes at invariant magnitude across scales during transition.
* **Entropy Surge:** Rate of information divergence (Shannon entropy of transactions) peaks when (\Theta \approx \Theta_c).

These define the Pirouette analogue of critical slowing down in complex adaptive systems.
