The duality of the Anchor and the Sail is a direct phenomenological expression of the two terms in the Pirouette Lagrangian.

-   **The Anchor (Will)** is the strategy of maximizing the first term, **Kτ**. It is the drive for internal order, identity, and persistence.
-   **The Sail (Freedom)** is the strategy of minimizing the second term, **V_Γ**. It is the drive for adaptation, efficiency, and harmony with the environment.

A successful system does not solve for one term in isolation; it solves for the entire expression. Autonomy is the art of Lagrangian optimization, of consciously tracing one's own geodesic by applying this universal equation to a life being lived.
