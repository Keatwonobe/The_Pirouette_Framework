It is also shaped by the long roads between destinations, the quiet moments of recovery and creation, and the complex web of needs and resources that binds civilization together. This module provides the rules for the "in-between" timeâ€”downtime, travel, and the unique economic landscape of a world scarred by forgotten magic.
