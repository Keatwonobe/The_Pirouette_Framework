The old framework of PPS-061 correctly described a profound dynamic—a system's ability to store immense energy under pressure and then release it as a coherent wave. However, its ontology of three competing forces was fragmented. This module refactors that insight into the modern, time-first paradigm.

A catastrophic release is not a battle of forces. It is the story of a single system following its one inviolable law—the Principle of Maximal Coherence—as the landscape it traverses is violently transformed. We will demonstrate that both the silent tension of confinement and the singing pirouette of release are emergent properties of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). What was once seen as a complex proof is revealed as a universal process: the physics of a ringing bell.
