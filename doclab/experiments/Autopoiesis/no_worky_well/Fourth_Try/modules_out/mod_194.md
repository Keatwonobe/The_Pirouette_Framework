Domain: r ∈ [0, R_max], with R_max ≫ r_vir; compactify via x=r/(1+r).
Weak form: multiply (1) by test η, integrate over volume with weight r² and apply integration by parts.
Discretization: 1D spectral (Chebyshev) or 2D axisymmetric FEM for non‑spherical extensions.
Nonlinearity: Newton‑Krylov; line search; tolerance 1e‑10 for residual.
Mesh/points: N≥512 (spectral) or graded FEM with ≥4 core refinements.

Outputs (per solution):
• Core radius r_c (e.g., radius where ρ_Γ drops to ρ_0/2)
• Central density ρ_0 = ρ_Γ(0)
• Surface‑density product Σ_0 = ρ_0 r_c
• V_c(r) curve; maximum V_max and radius r_max
• κ(θ) profile and Einstein radius θ_E (if any)
• Discrete label T and stability flag
