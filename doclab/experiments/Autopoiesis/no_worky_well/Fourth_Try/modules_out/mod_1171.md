Aesthetic experience is not passive reception but an active, reciprocal coupling between two coherence manifolds: that of the artwork and that of the observer.

1.  **The Artwork as a Coherence Manifold:** Every artwork is the physical anchoring of a unique temporal resonance (Ki). The old "twelve artistic vectors" (form, symbol, color, etc.) are now understood as descriptive labels for the various harmonics and topological features of this unified Ki pattern.
    *   **High-Gradient Manifolds:** Works with sharp, unambiguous patterns (e.g., photorealism, a simple melody) present a steep, well-defined landscape. They guide perception forcefully along a single path.
    *   **Low-Gradient Manifolds:** Works that are ambiguous or abstract (e.g., a dense poem, abstract expressionism) present a soft, open landscape. They invite the observer to project their own **Observer's Shadow** (CORE-010) onto them, becoming a co-creator of the work's meaning.

2.  **Reciprocity:** The dialogue is two-way. As the observer's shadow falls upon the art, the art's powerful and coherent Ki pattern is cast back, creating ripples in the observer's own manifold. This is the physical mechanism of being "moved" by art.
