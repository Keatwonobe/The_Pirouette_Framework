With `α` revealed as an emergent property of resonant geometry, we can now use its experimentally measured value to calibrate the engine of reality itself. We formalize this relationship not as a loose proportionality, but as a defining axiom that anchors the entire scale of Temporal Pressure.

> **Axiom 15.1 (The Empirical Anchor):** The dimensionless scale of Temporal Pressure (Γ) is anchored to the strength of the electromagnetic interaction. The effective Γ experienced by an electron in its fundamental self-interaction is defined as the inverse of the fine-structure constant.

**Γ_effective_electron ≡ 1/α ≈ 137.036**

This axiom is not an arbitrary derivation; it is a definition. It is the framework choosing its fundamental unit of measure. Just as a meter is defined by the speed of light, the unit of Temporal Pressure is now defined by the precise, furious hum of the electron.
