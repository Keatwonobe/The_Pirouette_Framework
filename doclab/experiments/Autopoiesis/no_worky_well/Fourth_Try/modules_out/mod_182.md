Goal: explain ρ_DM ~ ρ_DE today without tuning.
Mechanism: **tracker/attractor tail** appended to quadratic core of V(Γ), consistent with D2 (analytic, local, scale‑covariant). Two options:

(1) Exponential tail (analytic):
V(Γ) = ½ m_Γ² Γ² + μ⁴ [1 − e^{−Γ/Γ_*}]  (μ≪m_Γ, Γ_*>0)
• Early: quadratic dominates → CDM‑like oscillations.
• Late: as Γ amplitude redshifts, field probes the shallow exp tail; slow‑roll sets in with tracker behavior that naturally turns on when ρ_m drops below a scale ∝ μ⁴.

(2) Cosine tail (shift‑symmetry remnant):
V(Γ) = ½ m_Γ² Γ² + μ⁴ [1 − cos(Γ/f)] with f≫M_pl, μ≪m_Γ.
• Early oscillations in quadratic; late slow‑roll near a cosine plateau triggers DE‑like phase.

Both tails are analytic and allowed by D2; their parameters (μ, Γ_* or f) are **U‑class** constants fixed by D3 one‑shot anchor in COSMO‑Γ‑000 (e.g., anchoring Ω_Γ,0) and then frozen.

Dynamical attractor evidence:
• Phase‑space (x≡Γ̇/√(6)H, y≡√(V)/√(3)H) has late‑time fixed points with 0<1+w_Γ≪1; stability shown by eigenvalues of linearized system <0.
• Coincidence arises because slow‑roll only turns on when the oscillation amplitude decays into the tail—set by μ, not by arbitrary time.

Falsification: if fitting CMB+BAO+SNe requires independent CDM and DE fluids once parameters are frozen, the unification fails.
