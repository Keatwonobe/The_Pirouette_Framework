By understanding the time-first mechanics, we can identify and even influence a Cascade.

| Phase           | Diagnostic Signature                                          | Intervention Principle                                          |

| **Precursor**   | High, stable Kτ combined with rising internal or external Γ.  | **Venting:** Create controlled release valves to bleed off pressure and prevent a catastrophic rupture. |
| **Rupture**     | Catastrophic drop in system-wide coherence; surge in entropy. | **Seeding:** Introduce "scaffolding" Ki patterns to guide the Flood toward desirable outcomes.     |
| **Flood**       | High variance in transient, competing Ki patterns.              | **Harvesting:** Deploy "nets" to capture and record the novel forms generated before they are lost. |
| **Crystallization** | Emergence and stabilization of a few dominant Ki patterns.     | **Pruning:** Reinforce the most promising new forms and help cull the unstable ones to speed up settling. |
