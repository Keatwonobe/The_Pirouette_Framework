The logistic map, $x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n)$, is a one-dimensional laboratory for the universal dynamics described in the Pirouette Framework. It is a microcosm of a system's attempt to find a stable form under environmental pressure. We can map its components directly to the Framework's language:

| Dynamic System Term | Pirouette Framework Correspondence | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Control Parameter (`r`)** | **Temporal Pressure Proxy (`Γ`)** | A proxy for the external environmental stress or resource complexity. Higher `r` values demand more complex solutions from the system. |
| **System State (`x_n`)** | **Resonant Pattern (`Ki`)** | The system's state at a given moment; its current attempt to find a stable, coherent form in response to the ambient `Γ`. |
| **Periodic Orbit** | **Laminar Flow (High Coherence)** | A stable, repeating `Ki` pattern with a well-defined Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`). The system has found an efficient, resonant solution. |
| **Chaotic Regime** | **Turbulent Flow (Low Coherence)** | A noisy, unpredictable `Ki` pattern with low Time Adherence (`T_a`). The system is unable to resolve the environmental pressure into a stable rhythm. |
| **Lyapunov Exponent (`λ`)** | **Quantitative Coherence** | A precise measure of a system's stability. Negative `λ` indicates a stable, Laminar state where perturbations decay. Positive `λ` indicates a chaotic, Turbulent state where perturbations grow exponentially. `λ = 0` marks the "edge of chaos." |
