Like a complex bell, the Knot's topology is rich with symmetries that create a "resonant cavity" at the heart of reality. Just as an instrument's shape determines which notes can be played, the Knot's shape dictates which forms of matter can achieve stable resonance.

The **Macroparticle Lattice** is the quantized spectrum of these allowed harmonics. It is the complete set of stable Ki patterns that can persist within the boundary conditions set by the Knot. Its 8-lobed geometry forms a landscape of "Resonance Pockets"—stable attractor basins in the coherence manifold where a nascent Ki pattern can find a harmonic relationship with the foundational rhythm of the universe. Any resonance that does not conform to this geometric template is unstable and quickly dissolves back into the ambient noise of the Temporal Forge (Γ).
