1. **Parameters on Consequences vs. Pre-State?**  
   - **Answer:** We endorse *both*. Consequence mapping is essential for justice; pre-state gates are vital for prevention.  
2. **Empirical Wound Channel for Ritual?**  
   - **Answer:** Absolutelyâ€”rituals must be evidence-driven. Yet they flourish when bounded by parametric admission controls.  
3. **Residual-Gated Ritual Gaming Scenario?**  
   - **Answer:** An adversary could launch rapid micro-attacks that individually fall under residual thresholds but cumulatively damage the system. **Counter:** Introduce **Cumulative Residual Logging** and **Decay-Adjusted Gates** to detect aggregated harm over time.
