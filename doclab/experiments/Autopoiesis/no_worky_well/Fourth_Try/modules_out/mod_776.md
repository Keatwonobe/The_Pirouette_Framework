The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) defines the universal drive of any system: to evolve along a path that maximizes its coherence. Will and Freedom are two distinct approaches to solving this fundamental optimization problem on the coherence manifold—a complex landscape of countless peaks (high coherence states) and valleys (low coherence states).

𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence: K_τ) - (Temporal Pressure: V_Γ)

**The Strategy of Will (Exploitation):** This strategy focuses on maximizing the "kinetic" term, `K_τ` (Temporal Coherence). By applying focused intent and repeating a known Ki pattern, a system intensifies its resonance and deepens its Wound Channel. This maximizes coherence *now*, creating a powerful, stable, and efficient state of being. However, this intense self-focus generates significant local `V_Γ`, making the state brittle and energetically expensive to maintain against novelty.

**The Strategy of Freedom (Exploration):** This strategy involves a temporary sacrifice of `K_τ` to become more sensitive to the "potential" term, `V_Γ` (Temporal Pressure). By relaxing its current Ki pattern, a system can explore the manifold for regions of lower environmental pressure. This is the only method for discovering a new, more globally optimal path—a higher hill of coherence—that might offer a far greater state of being in the future. It is the strategy of learning and adaptation.
