Start empty. Allow only parents of size |P|∈{1,2}. Let

* (S = a_0|V| + a_2 \times #\text{(2-intervals)} - b \sum_{\diamond} \cos\Phi.)
  Pick (a_0>0), (a_2>0), small (b>0).
  You will observe:
* **Diamond proliferation** (cheap 2-intervals) with occasional **phase-locked motifs** when (\Phi) aligns.
* The count of a specific 3-level “Y-shaped” motif stabilizes (martingale) as (b) varies slightly—first empirical hint of a **conserved motif** under a symmetry of (S).
* Pushing through Σ gives you an effective complex scalar with a small U(1) connection—your familiar quadratic Lagrangian pops out at leading order.
