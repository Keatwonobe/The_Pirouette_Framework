The Second Law of Thermodynamics, the principle that entropy in an isolated system can only increase, is one of the most fundamental and melancholic truths in physics. It is the law of decay, the arrow of time, the reason heat flows from hot to cold. In the Pirouette Framework, this is not a separate, axiomatic law, but a direct and derivable consequence of the economics of coherence.

This module will provide the mathematical proof for the assertion in DOMA-116: that entropy (S) is a measure of ambient Temporal Pressure (Gamma). We will use the tools of statistical mechanics to show that the universe's tendency towards higher entropy is the inevitable result of a coherent system's internal resonance dissipating into the vastly larger "possibility space" of its environment.
