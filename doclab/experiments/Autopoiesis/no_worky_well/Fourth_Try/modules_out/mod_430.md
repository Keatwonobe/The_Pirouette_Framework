The Wound Channel is a dynamic geometric object, governed by a clear set of properties that subsume and clarify the old model's traits of "Width," "Persistence," and "Echo Strength."

*   **Propagation & Fidelity:** The echo propagates from the Wound Channel, not as a perfect copy, but as a ripple of the original Ki pattern. Its fidelity decreases with distance, and its speed is modulated by the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). In the dense, chaotic Γ of a star's core, echoes are muffled and die quickly. In the placid vacuum of deep space, they may travel for eons.

*   **Inertia & Identity:** An entity is perpetually interacting with the geometry of its own immediate past. This self-interaction is the origin of inertia. To change velocity or state is to fight against the shape of one's own Wound Channel. This provides a profound stability; an entity's identity is maintained because it is constantly "reminded" of what it was a moment ago by the very shape of the space it occupies.

*   **Reinforcement:** When an entity repeats a behavior, it traverses the same region of its coherence manifold. Each pass deepens and clarifies the Wound Channel, like a river carving its bed. The path of maximal coherence, as calculated by the Lagrangian, is thus biased towards this established channel. This is the mechanism of habit, learning, and the strengthening of memory.
