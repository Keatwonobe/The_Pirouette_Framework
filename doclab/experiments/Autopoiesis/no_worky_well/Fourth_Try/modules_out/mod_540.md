The balance sheet is a photograph of where the river was. The flow is a prophecy of where the river is going.

The old Business Resonance Lens (PPS-020) sought to quantify a firm's health with a single, complex score. This was a noble but limited goal, like trying to understand a river by measuring its depth at a single point. This ratified module reframes the entire domain. A business is not a static entity to be measured; it is a living system defined by the quality of its flows.

Here, we apply the universal diagnostic protocol of The Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) to the domain of commerce. A healthy, profitable organization is one that achieves a state of **Laminar Flow**, where value, information, talent, and trust move with effortless efficiency. Pathologies—from bureaucratic gridlock to market panic—are diagnosed as disruptions in this flow. The goal is no longer to calculate a score, but to read the currents and learn the art of river-keeping.
