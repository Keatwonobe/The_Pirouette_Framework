summary: 'Provides a universal simulation engine for modeling and engineering system
  evolution. It operationalizes the Pirouette Lagrangian by treating evolution as
  a ''geodesic search'' within a simulated ''Crucible.'' The engine models how a system
  finds its path of maximal coherence through a dual mechanism: continuous, local
  ''Gradient Ascent'' (learning) and discontinuous, non-local ''Alchemical Leaps''
  (synthesis/inheritance). This unifies learning, adaptation, and evolution under
  a single, predictive dynamic principle.'
