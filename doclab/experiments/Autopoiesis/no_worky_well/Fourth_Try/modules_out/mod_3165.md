1. **Code archiving** – tag the analyzer repo `v1.0-ki-seismic` with the exact
   constants hard-wired in lines 62–66.
2. **Blind test** – run on a contrived control day (no M ≥ 4 events) to show
   false-positive rate ≪ 5 %.
3. **Cross-network** – replicate on IRIS BK, IU global broadband for 3 more
   tectonic settings.
