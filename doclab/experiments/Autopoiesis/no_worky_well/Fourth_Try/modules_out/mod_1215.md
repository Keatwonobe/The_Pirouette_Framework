The most important question in any collapse is that of reversibility. This is determined by the integrity of the system's **Wound Channel** (CORE-011)â€”the geometric memory of its healthy, coherent state.

*   **Elastic Collapse:** A recoverable failure. The system is pushed violently into turbulence or stagnation, but its underlying Wound Channel remains intact. Like a bent piece of steel, it retains the memory of its true shape. Once the external pressure is relieved, the system can use its Wound Channel as a guide to "snap back" to its previous state of laminar flow.

*   **Critical Collapse:** An irreversible fracture. The pressure is so intense or prolonged that it permanently deforms or shatters the system's Wound Channel. The memory of the healthy state is erased. The system cannot return to what it was. Like a broken glass, its fundamental structure has been altered. It must now find a new, often simpler, state of coherence from the remaining pieces.
