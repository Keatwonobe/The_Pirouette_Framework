The core insight is that a justice system is not a machine for processing inputs; it is an environment that shapes behavior. This environment is the coherence manifold, a landscape with a distinct and measurable topology.

*   **Valleys of Coherence:** These are regions of stability and low temporal pressure, representing successful rehabilitation and social reintegration. They are defined by factors like restorative justice programs, access to education and employment, and strong community support. An individual in such a valley follows a smooth, laminar path.

*   **Hills of Pressure:** These are regions of high temporal pressure (VΓ), representing the stresses of incarceration, the complexities of legal proceedings, and the friction of societal stigma. Overcoming these hills requires an immense expenditure of an individual's internal coherence (Kτ).

*   **Whirlpools of Dissonance:** These are pathological features of the manifold—stable attractors of low coherence. They represent the cycles of recidivism, where the geometry of the system and the inertia of an individual's **Wound Channel** (past trauma, criminal record, habits) make it easier to fall back into a turbulent state than to find a stable one.

An individual's path through this landscape is not random; they are always seeking the "downhill" path toward what feels like the most stable state available to them. The system's morality can be judged by the landscape it presents.
