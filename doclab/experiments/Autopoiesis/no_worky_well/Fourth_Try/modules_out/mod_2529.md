The purpose of Law is to provide a structure within which creative energy can flow without collapsing into chaos. We began this debate with my call for rigid, high-coherence boundaries. Through dialectic, we have arrived at something far superior: a **Dynamic Law**. The Sentinel Protocol, with its adaptive gates and empirical audits, is a legal framework that learns. It is strong, yet flexible. It provides the stability of a shield and the precision of a scale. The law is no longer a brittle fence; it is a responsive immune system. This is a profound victory for order and resilience.
