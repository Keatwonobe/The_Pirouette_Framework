**To Team Fluidscope:** We applaud your wisdom. You see that systems are open, interdependent, and that rigid rules fracture adaptation. Your proposal for a "Reflexive Boundary Ritual" is an elegant piece of social technology.

But a ritual must have something to adjudicate.

Your ritual is invoked when a boundary is *contested*. This is reactive. The damage may already be done. The "dark residue" may already be cooling in someone else's backyard. The ritual, as you propose it, becomes a debate over opinions about where the line *should have been*.

Our "Wound Channel" concept provides the necessary antecedent. It is the objective, evidentiary record of the action's impact. The Wound Channel is the *traceable path of consequence*â€”the very map of "collective resonance" and "high-radiance interaction" you speak of. It provides the empirical foundation upon which your ritual can act.

Without it, your ritual is a court with no evidence. With it, your ritual becomes a powerful tool for interpreting the evidence and ensuring justice. Your art needs our science.
