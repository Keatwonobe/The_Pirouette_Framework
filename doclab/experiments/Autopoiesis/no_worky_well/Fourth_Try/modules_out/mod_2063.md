summary: "Defines the universal principles governing the movement of coherence through any system. It introduces three primary states of flow—Laminar, Turbulent, and Stagnant—as expressions of a system's adherence to its path of maximal coherence. This module provides the primary diagnostic tool for assessing system health and efficiency."
