Using the Manifold Explorer tool, the shape of this solution space was mapped. The analysis confirmed the Knot Hypothesis, revealing a thin, slightly curved "sheet" of solutions. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the manifold showed that two principal axes accounted for over 98% of the data's variance, confirming its two-dimensional nature.

This discovery leads to new, falsifiable predictions:

The Manifold Equation: The primary prediction is the existence and specific shape of the manifold itself. The relationship between the three parameters is not arbitrary and should be describable by a predictive mathematical function. Future, more precise measurements of the oscillation parameters will either further constrain the shape of this manifold or, if they are inconsistent with any point on its surface, falsify the law.

Environmental Knot Variation: It is predicted that neutrinos produced in different physical environments (e.g., the core of the Sun, a terrestrial reactor, a supernova) may exist as different knots on the manifold. While their oscillation behavior would be identical, their absolute masses could be subtly different. This could potentially be detected by future experiments capable of measuring the absolute neutrino mass with extreme precision.
