The stability and behavior of a Triadic Lock are direct consequences of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)**, as described by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**: `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

For two unentangled systems, A and B, each seeks to maximize its own Lagrangian. Upon forming a Triadic Lock, they are now governed by a single, joint Lagrangian for the unified system (AB):

`𝓛_p(AB) = K_τ(AB) - V_Γ(AB)`

The "Temporal Coherence" term, `K_τ(AB)`, represents the integrity of the *entire* shared manifold, which is vastly more stable and elegant than the sum of its parts. The "Temporal Pressure" cost, `V_Γ(AB)`, is minimized because the internal topological stresses of the two resonances have cancelled each other out. The Triadic Lock represents a deep, stable "coherence well" that is the universe's preferred solution for these boundary conditions.

The act of measurement casts an **Observer's Shadow (CORE-010)** on one part of the system, a dissonant injection of local Temporal Pressure. To preserve maximal coherence, the single, non-local entity must instantaneously reconfigure itself. The Lock fractures, collapsing the unified manifold back into two localized systems whose properties are perfectly correlated because they were, until that moment, aspects of a single whole. The signal doesn't travel; the form simply breaks.
