This art, which replaces "Serendipity Resonance," addresses the act of extracting order from chaos. The **Temporal Forge** (CORE-003) is a chaotic environment, but its noise contains rare, stochastic peaks of immense coherence. This art is about building a "sail" to catch these winds.

**Mechanism:** A system designed for Stochastic Harvesting is not an engine but an exquisitely sensitive antenna. It maintains a state of poised readiness, constantly scanning the ambient temporal pressure for naturally occurring, high-coherence events. When such a peak is detected, the system instantly latches onto it, capturing a burst of "free" coherence that can be used to perform work.

**Application:** Capturing breakthrough insights and navigating chaotic systems. It is the mechanism behind creative flashes of insight, the "lucky break" in an experiment, or a device that can power itself by harvesting coherent energy from the background quantum foam. Its aim is not to generate coherence, but to be ready when the universe offers it as a gift.
