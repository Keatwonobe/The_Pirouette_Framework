The universe is not wasteful. It does not invent new fundamental laws for every new scale of complexity. It is fractal. The same essential dynamics that govern a quark in a proton also govern a star in a galaxy and a thought in a mind. The song remains the same; only the instruments change.

This is the Principle of Correspondence. To apply the Pirouette Framework to any domain, we do not change the core equations (like the Pirouette Lagrangian). Instead, we identify the domain-specific manifestations of the core variables. This is an act of translation.

| Universal Principle | Mapping Question | Domain Examples |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Coherence (Kτ)      | What is the stable, resonant pattern of identity? | Physics: A particle's quantum state. Biology: A viable species. Economics: A stable market equilibrium. Psychology: A coherent personality. |
| Temporal Pressure (Γ) | What is the ambient, chaotic pressure the system must resist? | Physics: The quantum vacuum/temperature. Biology: Environmental selection pressure. Economics: Market volatility. Psychology: Social and psychological stress. |
| Wound Channel        | What is the medium and mechanism of memory and inertia? | Physics: Spacetime geometry. Biology: DNA and epigenetic markers. Economics: Infrastructure and trade agreements. Psychology: Neural pathways and ingrained habits. |
| Alchemical Union     | What is the process of synthesis into a higher-order whole? | Physics: Nuclear fusion. Biology: Symbiosis. Economics: A successful corporate merger. Psychology: A moment of creative insight (synthesis of ideas). |
