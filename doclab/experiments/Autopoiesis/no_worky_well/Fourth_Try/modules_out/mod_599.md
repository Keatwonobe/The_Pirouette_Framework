Drift is the quiet death, the slow victory of entropy as described in the Principle of Coherence Degradation (CORE-013). It is the pathology of inattention, where relentless, low-level friction from the Temporal Forge slowly erodes the system's coherence (`K_Ï„`), like silt filling a riverbed. Its flow becomes sluggish, its channel ill-defined, and its identity blurs until it dissolves back into the background noise.
*   **Manifestation:** The slow decline of an institution through neglect; the fading of a memory over time; a project dying from a thousand small cuts and a lack of clear purpose.
