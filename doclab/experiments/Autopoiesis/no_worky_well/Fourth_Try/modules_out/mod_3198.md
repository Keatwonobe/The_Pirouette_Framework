To address the critique and eliminate the "fudge factor," we must calibrate the `proportionality_constant` by anchoring the **Gamma** scale to a foundational, physical system. In astronomy, "standard candles" are used to calibrate distance; we will use a "standard confinement system" to calibrate **Gamma**.

[cite_start]The most fundamental, stable, confined system described in the Pirouette Framework is the **proton**[cite: 7]. We will use it as our standard.

Here is the three-step plan to physically ground the value of **Gamma**:
