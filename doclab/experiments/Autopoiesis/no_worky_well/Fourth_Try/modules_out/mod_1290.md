This protocol is a form of social engineering designed to manipulate the coherence manifold of the debate, making it easier for participants to follow the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006) collectively.

The **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`) states that a system seeks the path of highest internal coherence (`K_τ`) for the lowest environmental cost or pressure (`V_Γ`). This protocol modifies the "potential" term (`V_Γ`) of the shared discursive space.

*   Without the protocol, the path of least resistance (lowest `V_Γ`) is often tribalistic defense of one's own position—an easy, low-energy state of high personal coherence.
*   The ritual's rules—especially the ban on refutation and the shared declaration of intent—artificially raise the "cost" (`V_Γ`) of adversarial behavior. It becomes socially and procedurally "expensive."
*   Simultaneously, the protocol lowers the cost of collaboration, making the search for a shared, higher-order truth the new geodesic—the path of maximal coherence for the group as a whole. The rules make it *easier* to build together than to fight apart.
