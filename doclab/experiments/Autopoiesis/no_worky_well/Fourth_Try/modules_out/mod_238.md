Every system has a breaking point. As ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) intensifies, there comes a moment where a system's existing resonant pattern (Ki) is no longer a viable solution. The cost of maintaining its current form becomes unsustainable. This is the moment of irreversible bifurcation, the "do-not-return line" we call Sigma (Σ).

This is a phase transition. The system is pushed to a precipice where its path of maximal coherence fractures. It is forced to solve a critical optimization problem:
1.  **Dissolution:** It fails the test, its Ki pattern dissolving entirely. Its coherence is eroded by the temporal friction, and its structure is lost to the background noise of the forge.
2.  **Transformation:** It discovers a new, more stable Ki—a different resonant geometry that is a superior solution to the high-Γ environment. It reconfigures, turning the pressure from an antagonist into a boundary condition for a new state of being.

Once this line is crossed, the old reality is gone, its potential collapsed into a new, hardened actuality.
