Every challenge a player faces has a total entropic power level, its Entropic Budget. This is the GM's primary tool for scaling encounters and defining their difficulty.

Calculating the Budget: An encounter's EB is determined relative to the party's combined power. First, calculate the Party's Average TEP.
Party Average TEP = (Total TEP of all characters) / (Number of characters)

Encounter Difficulty:
| Difficulty | Entropic Budget (EB) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Trivial | 0.5 x Party Average TEP | A minor obstacle, easily overcome. |
| Normal | 1.0 x Party Average TEP | An equal footing. A 50/50 slog where strategy is key. |
| Hard | 1.25 x Party Average TEP | A significant challenge requiring teamwork and resource management. |
| Very Hard | 1.5 x Party Average TEP | A boss-level encounter that will likely drain the party significantly. |
| Legendary | 2.0+ x Party Average TEP | A world-altering threat that may require extensive preparation to survive. |

For a group of opponents, the GM can either give each creature a smaller portion of the total EB or create one powerful leader and several weaker minions.
