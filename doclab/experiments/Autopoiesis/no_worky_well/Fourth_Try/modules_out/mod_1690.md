The Probe provides a clean, four-step workflow for moving from the noise of systemic chaos to a clear, actionable diagnosis.

**Step I: Define and Measure Coherence (`Kτ`)**
Using the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014), identify the primary output that represents the system's health or purpose. This becomes the metric for its coherence, `Kτ`. This could be tasks completed per hour in a workflow, signal fidelity in a network, or subjective well-being in a person. The input is a time series of this metric.

**Step II: Attribute Coherence Loss (`ΔKτ`)**
Log every discrete event, state, or component within the system. Correlate these events with the `Kτ` time series to calculate the change in coherence (`ΔKτ`) associated with each one. This creates a direct causal ledger, linking specific events (e.g., "server error," "meeting," "dependency wait") to their impact on the system's health.

**Step III: Rank by Impact**
Create a sorted list of all event types, ranked in descending order by the total negative `ΔKτ` they have caused. This immediately surfaces the most damaging sources of turbulence.

**Step IV: Identify the Vital Few**
Calculate a cumulative sum of the coherence loss down the ranked list. The "Pareto Frontier" is the point at which a user-defined threshold (typically 80%) of the total loss is accounted for. The small set of event types above this frontier is the system's list of critical bottlenecks.
