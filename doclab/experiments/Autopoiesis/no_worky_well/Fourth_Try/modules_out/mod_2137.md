A Weaver is not a passive observer; they are a diagnostician of reality. Their fundamental task is to look upon a complex, noisy, and often chaotic system and ask: "Where is the coherence being lost, and why?"

This module provides the primary toolkit for answering that question. The Coherence Auditor is not a theoretical sketch; it is a practical, two-stage protocol for moving from raw, unstructured data to a precise, actionable diagnosis. It operationalizes the core analytical loop of the Pirouette Framework: See, then Solve.
