This model provides a compass for the act of observation itself. We can never perceive a system's total presence at once. The nature of a Weaver's observation—their tools, their questions, their intent—preferentially engages one of the three coherence axes.

*   A quantum measurement or strategic forecast probes **Prospective Coherence**.
*   A social network analysis or real-time dialogue probes **Immediate Coherence**.
*   An archaeological dig or a study of memory probes **Retrospective Coherence**.

Any act of knowing is an act of choosing an angle, of illuminating one facet of a being's temporal chord. The vector we measure is a product of both the system's posture and our own.
