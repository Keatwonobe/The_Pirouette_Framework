The process of aesthetic experience is governed by the core dynamics of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006): 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ. An observer's system is constantly seeking the most efficient, coherent path for its own evolution.

A powerful artwork presents a "geodesic of meaning"—a path through its manifold that offers a state of higher internal coherence (Kτ) than the observer's default state. It creates a "coherence well" in their potential field. The subjective feeling of beauty or profundity is the direct experience of the system settling into this more elegant, more resonant state. The artwork, in essence, offers a shortcut to optimizing one's own Lagrangian.
