This map is the signature of a **scholarly, multi-disciplinary field**. The gravity wells are distinct and represent different areas of academic inquiry.

* **Path of "Power" (Green):** "Power" is pulled strongly toward "**sprache**" (language) and "**ogaminschriften**" (Ogham inscriptions). It suggests the power of this topic lies in the act of linguistic deciphering and the study of the inscriptions themselves.
* **Path of "Freedom" (Magenta):** "Freedom" finds a different attractor, perhaps settling near scholars or institutions like "**maynooth**" or "**macneill**," implying that academic freedom is a key theme.
* **Path of "Wisdom" (Yellow):** "Wisdom" is pulled toward the study of the past—"**archaisms**"—and the scholars who interpret it.

**Conclusion:** The Ogham document creates a universe where abstract concepts are partitioned and claimed by different academic disciplines. The meaning of "power" is linguistic, while "wisdom" is archaeological and historical. The concepts are defined by the *tools used to study them*.
