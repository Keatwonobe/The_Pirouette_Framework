This entire dynamic is described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. This is the equation of the orbit. A system's path is the one that maximizes its own **Temporal Coherence** (`K_τ`) while navigating the landscape of **Temporal Pressure** (`V_Γ`).

*   The build-up of **Coherence Debt** is a state where the `V_Γ` term grows, lowering the Lagrangian's value.
*   The **Coherence Discharge** is the system's inevitable leap toward a state that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian, obeying the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

The Copernican Turn is the recognition that we are not the authors of this equation. We are its living solutions.
