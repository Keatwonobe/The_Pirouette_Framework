This principle operates at a meta-level to the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, per CORE-006). The Lagrangian describes the path of a system *within* a given coherence manifold. The Prime Resonance Principle describes the stability of the manifold *itself*.

The coherence wells are locations on the manifold representing local maxima of the system's action (`∫𝓛_p dt`). The Coherence Integrity metric, `Λ(N)`, is a statement about the *topology of this solution space*. A system with a high `Λ(N)` has a set of stable solutions that is structurally robust against large-scale perturbations in the ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). It predicts which *kinds* of systems are most likely to persist over long periods: those whose very architecture is indivisible.
