The Crucible is a direct, practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. Its entire purpose is to find an external action (an intervention) that allows a system to better satisfy its own internal drive. An intervention does not push a system; it reshapes the landscape upon which the system walks.

The core of the engine is the optimization of the action integral:

**S_p = âˆ« L_p dt**

The "best" intervention is the one that alters the coherence manifold such that the system, in following its new geodesic, achieves the highest possible value for S_p. The simulator is a search engine for interventions that maximize a system's potential for coherent, elegant action.
