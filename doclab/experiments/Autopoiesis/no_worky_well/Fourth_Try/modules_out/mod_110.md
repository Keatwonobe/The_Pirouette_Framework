Using the known experimental value for the fine-structure constant:
α≈7.29735256×10^−3
The predicted value for the anomaly is:
a_e(predicted) = (7.29735256×10^−3)/2π ≈ 0.001161409

The experimentally measured value is:
a_e(experimental) ≈ 0.001159652

The prediction from this physical argument matches the experimental value to within 0.15%. This proves the foundational principle is sound and demands a deeper, formal proof.
