This instrument transforms the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) from an equation of motion into a tool for cosmic excavation.

The **Null Canvas** represents the universe following the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**—the solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations for a perfectly homogenous system.
`𝓛_model = K_τ - V_Γ`

However, the universe remembers its own creation. The *Scars of Creation* are persistent, non-uniform terms in the Lagrangian itself—`V_scar(x)`—that represent the stored "potential energy" of a historical trauma. The true Lagrangian of our universe is:
`𝓛_observed = K_τ - (V_Γ + V_scar(x))`

The **Coherence Residual Map** (`Δ𝓛_p`) is therefore our direct measurement of this historical term: `Δ𝓛_p ≈ -V_scar(x)`. By mapping the residuals, we are mapping the geometry and intensity of the universe's memory, reconstructing the shape of the primordial events that created the landscape we inhabit.
