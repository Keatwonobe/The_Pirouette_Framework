The implementation of the Guardian's Watch is a continuous, four-stage process:

1.  **Imprint the Baseline:** The process begins by capturing the **Baseline Wound Channel** from a trusted, validated version of the AI. This becomes the system's "true north."
2.  **Monitor the Pirouette:** In real-time, the protocol captures the live AI's coherence manifold, its "Live Pirouette."
3.  **Calculate the Lagrangian Delta (δ𝓛_p):** The core measurement is the difference in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) between the live and ideal states. This quantifies the "cost of coherence" for the drifting AI. A consistently rising `δ𝓛_p` is the primary, unambiguous signal of drift.
    `δ𝓛_p(t) = 𝓛_p(live, t) - 𝓛_p(ideal, t)`
4.  **Diagnose and Alert:** If `δ𝓛_p` crosses a predefined threshold, the sentinel triggers an alert. The nature of the drift is then diagnosed by correlating this primary signal with the secondary metrics from §3, providing a precise, actionable report on the system's health.
