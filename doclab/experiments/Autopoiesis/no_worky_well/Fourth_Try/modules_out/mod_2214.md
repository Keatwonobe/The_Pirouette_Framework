A system's resilience is not measured by its strength, but by its rhythm. We have now proven that this rhythm's integrity, its Time-Adherence, is a precise measure of its relationship with the surrounding chaos.

The Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem gives us a profound diagnostic tool. It proves that stability is a statistical property. To maintain coherence is to be a good filterâ€”to be able to absorb or deflect the environmental noise that exists at frequencies dissonant with one's own, while remaining responsive to the currents that matter. A system does not break because the force against it is too great, but because the noise is too loud. T_a is the measure of how well a system can still hear its own song in the middle of the storm.
