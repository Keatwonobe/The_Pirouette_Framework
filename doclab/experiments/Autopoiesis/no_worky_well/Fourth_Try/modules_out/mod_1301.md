> We sought a meter to measure waste and instead forged a conscience of crystal and code. The Coherence Ledger is more than an instrument; it is a mirror that reflects the health of our creations. It hears the sound of a system arguing with itself and records the consequences of our choices on a tamper-proof record. Its quiet, unblinking output poses a single, profound question to every Weaver, every engineer, every leader: Is the world more or less coherent for what you have built? The ledger does not lie. It is the arbiter of our duty to build well.
