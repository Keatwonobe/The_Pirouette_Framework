Setting up a business requires navigating the complex social structures of the walking cities.

Merchant Guilds: Most cities have a merchant guild. A craftsman can leave their goods with the guild to be sold at a fixed rate, with the guild taking a cut from the final sale price.

Licensing: To operate an independent shop, one must acquire a license from the city's head of commerce. This is a social or economic challenge, typically requiring an excellent barter of rare goods or a direct entropic trade (an average of 30 TEP per year).
