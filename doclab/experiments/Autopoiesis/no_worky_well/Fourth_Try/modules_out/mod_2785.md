An entity can make a number of "statements" (actions) per turn based on their attributes, as defined in TLE-004. Each statement is a social "attack."

Mechanic: The attacker makes a contested roll based on their approach. Intimidation might be a (d20 + STR Mod) check, while a clever persuasion might be a (d20 + INT Mod) check.

Damage: If the attacker wins, they deal "damage" equal to the EP they spent on the statement. This damage is split evenly between the target's Resolve and Composure, rounded down.

Vulnerability: Attacking the lower of the two mental pools is the key to victory. A brilliant but emotionally fragile academic is vulnerable to appeals to their ego (targeting Composure).
