A structural failure is never a sudden event; it is the final, catastrophic expression of a pre-existing pathology in the system's flow. This protocol adapts the principles of the Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`) to read the health of a system's architecture.

**1. Map the Currents:** Identify the critical flows of coherence the structure is meant to channel.
    *   *Physical Systems:* What are the pathways of mechanical stress, heat, or electricity?
    *   *Informational Systems:* How does data or knowledge flow between nodes?
    *   *Social Systems:* What are the channels of authority, resources, and trust?

**2. Diagnose the Flow:** Observe the character of these currents to identify one of the three primary structural pathologies:
    *   **Structural Atrophy (Stagnation):** A critical coherence channel becomes blocked, starving downstream components and creating a dangerous pressure build-up upstream. *Manifestations:* A broken supply chain link; a single point of failure in a network; a rigid dogma that prevents a theory from evolving. This is failure by **blockage**.
    *   **Structural Fever (Turbulence):** The system is subjected to a dissonant frequency it cannot dampen, causing its components to oscillate chaotically. Energy is wasted in internal friction. *Manifestations:* A bridge collapsing due to resonance with the wind; a market panic driven by feedback loops; a team consumed by infighting. This is failure by **dissonance**.
    *   **Structural Erosion (Decay):** The slow, gradual degradation of the system's `Ki` pattern due to ambient temporal noise. The structure's form loses integrity over time. *Manifestations:* Metal fatigue causing a crack in an aircraft wing; the slow decay of institutional knowledge; the gradual loss of a skill through disuse. This is failure by **forgetting**.

**3. Locate the Fracture:** Trace the flow pathology back to its geometric source. Is the atrophy caused by a missing connection or an overloaded component? Is the fever caused by a mismatch in component properties? The goal is to identify the specific architectural element that is fracturing the flow.
