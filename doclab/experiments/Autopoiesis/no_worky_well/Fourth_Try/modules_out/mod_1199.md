The dynamics of a Bloom provide a powerful diagnostic lens. By observing a system's flow state and the character of its output, a Weaver can assess its potential for, and progress within, a generative cascade.

*   **Pre-Bloom Indicators (High Potential):**
    *   **Sustained Turbulence:** The system displays high but non-fatal internal friction and chaotic activity.
    *   **Mounting Pressure (Î“):** External constraints or internal demands are rising, making the current state increasingly untenable.
    *   **Novelty Injection:** The presence of new, unintegrated components or "seed" ideas that offer alternative organizational principles.

*   **Bloom-in-Progress Indicators (The Cascade is Underway):**
    *   **Flow State Shift:** A sudden, observable transition from chaotic, `Turbulent Flow` to highly organized, efficient `Laminar Flow`.
    *   **Exponential Output:** A rapid, S-curve increase in the system's primary output (e.g., scientific papers, artistic works, species diversity).
    *   **Emergence of a New Language:** A new unifying paradigm or shared identity rapidly propagates through the system, organizing its behavior.

While the mechanism is universal, the character of a Bloom is defined by the geometry of the new Ki pattern that emerges. We can classify its dominant mode of expansion:

-   **Divergent Bloom:** The new state opens a vast new parameter space of possibilities (e.g., the Cambrian Explosion, a scientific revolution).
-   **Convergent Bloom:** The new state rapidly refines and perfects a single function or form (e.g., a technological "gold rush" around a new platform).
-   **Recursive Bloom:** The new state's primary function is to improve the process of blooming itself (e.g., the invention of the scientific method, the internet).
