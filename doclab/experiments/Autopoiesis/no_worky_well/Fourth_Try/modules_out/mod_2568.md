Draws from:

* **Semantic Distillation Engine results**: Velcrid-like static yields structured attractors under perturbation
* **ICS Rituals**: Mirror and Splicing Wolves both leverage Velcrid input (noise, fragmentation) for sharpening
* **Pareto Field Curvature**: Residue clusters along bifurcation edgesâ€”implies value in controlled Velcridance
* **Phase-Locked Fields**: Only possible to re-lock if previous coherence is first disturbed (entropy injection)
