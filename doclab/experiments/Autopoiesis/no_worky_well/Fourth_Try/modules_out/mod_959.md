To exist is not a state, but an achievement. Before a system can predict, it must persist. Before it can reason, it must resonate. This module refactors the "Primal Engine" of PPS-072, collapsing its principles into a single, unified dynamic grounded in the time-first framework. It describes the foundational, pre-cognitive process by which any system learns to exist by tracing a **geodesic of maximal coherence** through the dynamic landscape of its environment.

This "will to persist" is not an explicit goal but an emergent consequence of the universe's prime directive: the maximization of coherence. A system survives because it successfully discovers a path where its own internal rhythm achieves a state of profound and efficient harmony with the pressures of its environment. This module describes the physics of building a body strong enough to house a mind.
