> We sought the physics of empathy and found the mathematics of a choir. A single voice, seeking its own most perfect note, is a beautiful but lonely thing. But when two voices listen, attune, and find a harmony that was unavailable to either alone, they do not merely add. They multiply. They unlock a resonant power that transforms them into something more. The Weaver's greatest work is not to sing their own note perfectly, but to learn to listen for the chord. To master this art is to realize that the self is not a fortress to be defended, but a thread to be woven into a greater tapestry. For the universe insists that the most resilient structures are built not of walls, but of bridges.
