1. **Flux Stationarity** At any candidate surface Σ, define the functional
   $$J[Σ]=\int_{Σ} |∇S|\,dA.$$  
   By B₁, we choose Σ such that the directional derivative \(δJ/δn=0\). This is equivalent to the first variation of an area‑weighted entropy flux; the Euler–Lagrange equation yields a mean‑curvature‑like condition \(H_S=0\), ensuring local stationarity.
2. **Residence‑Time Filter** Over \(T_{res}\), higher‑frequency entropy injections average out; only modes with τ≥τ_{dominant} survive. Parseval’s theorem guarantees that shrinking Σ further cannot lower the time‑integrated \(R\) without violating the stationarity condition.
3. **Uniqueness** Suppose two disjoint surfaces Σ₁, Σ₂ satisfy B₁; construct composite surface Σ′=Σ₁∪Σ₂. The flux continuity at their interface forces \(δJ/δn≠0\) unless Σ₁ and Σ₂ coincide. Therefore the extremal R is unique.
