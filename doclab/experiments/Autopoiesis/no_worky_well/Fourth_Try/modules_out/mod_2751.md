Where TLE-000 defined the soul of a character—their entropic form—this module defines its function. An entity's will is not a passive state; it is an active force that imposes itself upon the world. Every action, from the swing of a sword to the whisper of a spell, is an expression of this will, a conversion of internal potential into external effect.

This module provides the universal mechanics for these expressions, consolidating the rules for actions, conflict, magic, and survival. It defines how Entropy Points (EP) are spent to shape reality.
