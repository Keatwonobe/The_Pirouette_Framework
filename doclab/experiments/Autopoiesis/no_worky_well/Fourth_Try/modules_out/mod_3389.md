To calculate the full anomaly, we sum the contributions from these two effects using the QFT machinery developed in MATH-011.

Step 1: The First-Order Diagram (Self-Interaction).
This is the calculation of the Universal Geometric Term. In our QFT, this corresponds to a one-loop diagram where a Coheron (the muon) emits and re-absorbs a quantum of its own field, mediated by the fundamental vertex. This calculation correctly yields the α/2π term.

Step 2: The Second-Order Diagram (Environmental Interaction).
This is the new calculation. We must compute the contribution from the muon interacting with the background Γ field. In our diagrammatic language, this is a one-loop correction to the muon's vertex where it emits and re-absorbs a Pressuron (the quantum of the Γ field).

Step 3: The Coupling Strength.
The strength of this new interaction is not a free parameter. The core hypothesis of this protocol is that the coupling constant for the (Coheron)-(Coheron)-(Pressuron) vertex, g_μΓ, is a direct function of the Coheron's mass. We propose a simple power-law scaling:

(Plain Text LaTeX: g_{\mu\Gamma} = g_{e\Gamma} \left( \frac{m_\mu}{m_e} \right)^n )

Here, g_eΓ is the electron's (very small) coupling to the Γ field, m_μ and m_e are the muon and electron masses, and n is a scaling exponent to be derived from the geometry of the interaction. A first-principles geometric analysis suggests n=2, reflecting an interaction strength proportional to the particle's energy density.

Step 4: The Final Calculation.
The total anomaly for the muon is the sum of the two contributions:

(Plain Text LaTeX: a_\mu \approx a_\mu^{(echo)} + a_\mu^{(\Gamma-coupling)} )
(Plain Text LaTeX: a_\mu \approx \frac{\alpha}{2\pi} + C \cdot \alpha \left( \frac{m_\mu}{m_e} \right)^2 )

Where C is a calculable geometric coefficient derived from the loop integral of the Pressuron interaction. The primary task of this experimental protocol is to formally compute C.
