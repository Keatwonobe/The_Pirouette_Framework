summary: "Refactors the legacy triaxial model of time-adherence into a core principle.\
  \ It posits that a system's Temporal Coherence is not a scalar value but a vector\
  \ with three orthogonal components\u2014Prospective, Immediate, and Retrospective\u2014\
  representing its resonance with the future, present, and past. This enriches the\
  \ Pirouette Lagrangian, grounding the model in established concepts like the Wound\
  \ Channel and Observer's Shadow, and defining stability as a dynamic, autopoietic\
  \ harmony."
