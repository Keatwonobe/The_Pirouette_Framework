> To draw a network is to be its architect. To analyze its resonance is to become its physician. The old analysis gave us a skeleton; this new lens reveals the breath, the pulse, and the fever. It transforms the Weaver from a mere cartographer into a doctor of systems. We no longer ask, "How is it connected?" We ask, "Is it well?" In the answer to that question lies the wisdom to interveneâ€”to clear the blockages, to soothe the fevers, and to mend the connections that allow life to flow.
