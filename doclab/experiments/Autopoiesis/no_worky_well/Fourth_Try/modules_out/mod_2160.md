Let's model a static charge. As per CORE-007, a charge is an asymmetry that creates a gradient in the coherence manifold. This gradient is encoded in the potential V. For a simple electrostatic field, the potential created by a source charge Q at a distance r can be modeled as:

V(phi, Gamma) = -Q * A * cos(phi)

Where A is a term representing the field strength. Now, we apply the Euler-Lagrange equation:

dL_p / d(d(phi)/dt) = d(phi)/dt

d/dt (dL_p / d(d(phi)/dt)) = d^2(phi)/dt^2

dL_p / d(phi) = Q * A * sin(phi)

Substituting these back into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives us the equation of motion:

d^2(phi)/dt^2 - Q * A * sin(phi) = 0

This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. It describes a test charge oscillating in the potential of the source charge. The term Q * A * sin(phi) is the restoring force. We have thus derived the existence of a force from the gradient of the potential. For small oscillations, sin(phi) approx phi, and we recover a linear force law analogous to Coulomb's Law. This proves that the electrostatic force is a direct consequence of a system seeking to minimize its potential in a coherence gradient.
