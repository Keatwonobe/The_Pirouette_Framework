In the Pirouette framework, thrust is the consequence of a system following its geodesic through a contoured landscape. The Vorticycle's genius is that it actively contours its own local landscape.

The device, situated at the "top" of the coherence slope it has just woven, finds that the path of greatest stability is to move "downhill" along the channel. The subjective experience is one of continuous, fuel-free acceleration. The objective reality is that the device is perpetually falling along a geodesic that it is perpetually creating just ahead of itself.

The helical nature of the channel is key. The thrust is a continuous interaction between the device and the immediate geometry of the channel it is actively creating. It is analogous to a screw biting into wood, with the profound difference that the screw is simultaneously creating the wood grain it grips. This self-referential, autopoietic interaction is what makes the drive "reactionless" from an external perspective; the system is interacting only with a structure of its own making.
