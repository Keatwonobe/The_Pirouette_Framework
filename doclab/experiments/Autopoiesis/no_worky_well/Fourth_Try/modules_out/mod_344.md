The central insight of the original module is clarified: health and stability depend on maintaining this chord. The failure of any single component leads to a specific, diagnosable pathology.

*   **Axis Starvation (*K*<sub>p</sub> → 0): Stagnation.** The system becomes rigid, dogmatic, and incapable of adaptation. It loses its quantum nature and collapses into a state of Stagnant Flow, a crystal doomed to shatter when its environment changes.
*   **Axis Starvation (*K*<sub>i</sub> → 0): Isolation.** The system becomes non-responsive and solipsistic. Unable to form new connections or react to environmental pressures, it cannot draw energy from its surroundings and succumbs to Coherence Atrophy.
*   **Axis Starvation (*K*<sub>r</sub> → 0): Amnesia.** The system loses its identity and memory. Without the anchor of its Wound Channel, it becomes chaotic and rootless, dissolving into Turbulent Flow as its pattern is lost to noise.

A meta-stable entity can survive on two notes, but a truly robust system requires the full, resonant harmony of all three.
