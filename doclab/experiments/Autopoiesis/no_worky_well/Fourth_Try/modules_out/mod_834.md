The neutron's behavior is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). Its path is the one that maximizes the action integral:

*S<sub>p</sub> = ∫ 𝓛<sub>p</sub> dt = ∫ (T<sub>a</sub> * ω<sub>k</sub> - f(Γ)) dt*

Here, `T_a * ω_k` is the neutron's internal Temporal Coherence, and `f(Γ)` is the coherence cost imposed by the external Temporal Pressure of the manifold. The two helical gratings present two different environmental cost functions, `f(Γ_left)` and `f(Γ_right)`.

To maximize the integral, the neutron's internal state must adapt. The solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equation for this system reveal that the neutron must adopt one of a set of discrete, stable modes of **Temporal Coherence (T<sub>a</sub>)**. These quantized "eigenstates" are not pre-existing properties; they are the most efficient ways for the neutron to *be* while navigating the chiral labyrinth. They are the emergent harmonics of its own song, played against the sculpted silence of the crystal.
