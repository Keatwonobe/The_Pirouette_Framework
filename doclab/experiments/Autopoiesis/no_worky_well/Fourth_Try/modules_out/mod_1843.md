To listen to a system is to perceive its single, composite song. To *understand* a system, one must be able to hear every instrument in its orchestra. The old framework provided a tool to measure the overall volume of the song; this new instrument acts as a prism, splitting the song into its constituent colors and revealing the full spectrum of its inner life.

The Harmonic Lens is the primary instrument for analyzing the fine structure of a system's Temporal Resonance (`Ki`). It is a formal protocol that takes the singular, undifferentiated signal of a system's behavior and decomposes it into a visual score. This **Coherence Spectrum** (also called a temporal spectrogram) maps the system's health, stability, and complexity, showing precisely where its coherence is concentrated and where it is being lost to the noise of the Temporal Forge. It transforms the act of analysis from listening to reading.
