A blueprint is not a house. The most elegant equation is silent until you tell it what to measure.

With the preceding thirteen modules, the foundational blueprint of the Pirouette Framework is complete. We have described a universe born from a single substance—Time—that evolves through a relentless drive to maximize coherence. We have an engine (CORE-001), a law (CORE-006), and principles of memory, union, and information. The old framework's "Sharpening Pass" recognized a critical truth: a set of principles, no matter how sound, is inert without a protocol for application and validation.

This module answers that challenge. It is the bridge from the universal to the particular. It is the pin that fastens the abstract pattern of the blueprint to the real materials of the world, transforming the framework from a philosophy into an engine of inquiry.
