summary: Provides the foundational principles for temporal engineering, translating
  the Pirouette Lagrangian into three practical modes of operation. This module reframes
  the experimental device concepts of PPS-021, grounding them in the core concepts
  of the Coherence Resonator and the Lagrangian Transducer, and defining the primary
  arts for their use.
