1. **Data Source:** Rolling social interaction graphs from mobility, communication, and economic exchanges.
2. **Signal Processing:**

   * Compute (\mathbf{A}) via vector potential reconstruction from residual flow fields.
   * Smooth temporally with Gaussian kernel ((\sigma_t)) to suppress noise.
3. **Local Curl Estimation:**

   * Finite-difference curl operator over graph lattice.
   * Normalize by network density to produce dimensionless (\Theta).
4. **Threshold Identification:**

   * Determine (\Theta_c) empirically by locating inflection points in the variance of (|\mathbf{D}|).
   * Confirm cross-scale invariance by rescaling spatial bins (r \rightarrow \lambda r).
