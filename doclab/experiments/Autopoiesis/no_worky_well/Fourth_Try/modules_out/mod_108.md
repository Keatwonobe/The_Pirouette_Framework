Before calculating the anomaly, we must first address the origin of the electron's intrinsic magnetic moment. A simple scalar particle (spin-0) has no magnetic moment. The electron is a fermion (spin-1/2), and its properties must be derived from the framework's principles.

In the Pirouette Framework, spin is not a fundamental, irreducible property. It is an emergent, topological feature of the Ki resonance.

A scalar particle (spin-0) is a simple, single-cycle resonance. It returns to its starting phase-state after one 360° rotation.

A fermion (spin-1/2), like the electron, is a Ki resonance with the topology of a Möbius strip. It is a helical pirouette in time that must complete two full cycles (720°) to return to its original phase-state.

The Pirouette Lagrangian does not describe the electron itself, but the underlying coherence field (T_a). The electron is a stable, two-cycle topological "knot" in this field. This two-cycle nature is the geometric origin of its fermionic properties and, crucially, its magnetic moment.
