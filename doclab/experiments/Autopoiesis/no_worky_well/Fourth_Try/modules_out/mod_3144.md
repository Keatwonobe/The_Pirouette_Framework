A photon follows the world-line of the laboratory helix (radius $R$, pitch $p=2\pi R$) while the entire guide moves along its axis with speed $v$ (β ≡ $v/c$, γ ≡ $1/\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}$).
The accumulated **total phase** after *one* spatial turn, measured by an observer co-moving with the guide, is the proper-time integral

$$
\Phi(\beta)=
\int\!k_\mu\,\tfrac{dX^\mu}{d\tau}\,d\tau
\;=\;
\underbrace{\Phi_{\text{geo}}}_{\text{Berry}}
\;+\;
\underbrace{\Phi_{\text{kin}}}_{\text{Wigner–Thomas}}
\;+\;
\underbrace{\Phi_{\text{dyn}}}_{\text{Doppler}}.
\tag{C.2}
$$

A careful four-vector calculation (full algebra in the appendix draft) gives

$$
\Phi(\beta)
=
-\pi
\,\Bigl[
1
\;+\;
\bigl(\tfrac{\pi}{3}-1\bigr)\beta^{2}
\Bigr].
\tag{C.3}
$$

* **$−\pi$** is the geometric phase of *Section A* (critical 45° helix).
* The bracketed term is the relativistic correction:
  – Berry curvature is boost-invariant → no γ;
  – Wigner rotation contributes $-\pi\beta^{2}$;
  – the dynamical Doppler shift restores $+\tfrac{\pi^{2}}{3}\beta^{2}$;
  net coefficient $(\pi/3-1)$.
