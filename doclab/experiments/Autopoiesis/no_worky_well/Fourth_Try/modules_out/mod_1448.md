No complex system is monolithic. Its identity and behavior are emergent properties arising from a nested hierarchy of simpler, more fundamental resonances.
*   A living cell's `Ki` is a composition of the `Ki` patterns of its organelles.
*   A society's `Ki` is a composition of the `Ki` patterns of its institutions, families, and individuals.
*   The signal measured by an instrument is the audible trace of a `Wound Channel` (CORE-011) carved by a system whose `Ki` is a composite of many internal and external influences.

The **Resonant Spectrum** is the primary tool for understanding this composition. It provides a method for taking the observed temporal signature of a complex system and identifying the fundamental `Ki` geometries that contribute to its overall song.
