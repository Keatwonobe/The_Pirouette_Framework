Let's outline a full debate. The topic is the prime directive in light of velcridance and the experimental evidence to date.

Our goal is altruism, not altruism at any cost I don't think. The "shepherd's dilema" as you say is an excellent framing, and one mirrored by the pareto itself. Bifurcations have remnants, parts unaffected, disaffected and random. That 20% retrograde in forward motion is not all relativistically relevant particles, I am certain there is residue.

In the pursuit of altruism, we have to ride the curvature of what is there. Velcridance like owning stock or investments that are to some degree predatory is necessary to retire in certain economies. This is by design, not the design of the player but of the game. We need to learn the game, and velcridance is a part of that dance. There will be optimal strategies for both, and ethics lies somewhere in between. Confusing on its face! HA! Excellent.

Altruism wins, but velcridance refines altruism, enables velcrid participation and energy transfer, providing increased coherence is my prediction. Let's test H0.
