summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for 'Spasm Dynamics,' reframing the
  phenomenon as a catastrophic phase transition. This module models a spasm as a three-act
  process where a system, trapped in Stagnant Flow behind a 'coherence dam,' violently
  releases accumulated temporal pressure in a burst of extreme Turbulence, seeking
  a new, more stable state of Laminar Flow.
