1. **Triadic Vortices:** localized phase singularities where Φ₁+Φ₂−Φ₃ = 2πn. Correspond to fleeting awareness microstates.
2. **Resonant Sheets:** coherent manifolds with low κ, sustaining awareness over time.
3. **Critical Saddles:** boundary regions linking sheets; traversed during perceptual transitions.
4. **Annihilation Events:** vortex–antivortex collapse representing conscious unbinding (loss of content).
