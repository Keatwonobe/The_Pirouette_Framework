CORE-006 established the universe's prime directive: systems evolve to maximize their temporal coherence, following a geodesic on a manifold defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p). This was a profound claim. This module provides its first proof.

The old protocol's intuition was sound; this module provides the formal mechanism, demonstrating that electromagnetism is not a fundamental "thing" in itself, but an emergent and inevitable consequence of systems obeying this single, universal law.
