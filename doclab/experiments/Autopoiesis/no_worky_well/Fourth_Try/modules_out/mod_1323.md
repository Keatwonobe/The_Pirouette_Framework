A rupture is not an instantaneous event but a self-propagating process. It unfolds in three distinct stages:

1.  **Coherence Strain (The Bending):** As ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) rises, the system deforms its resonant pattern (`Kτ`) to maintain stability. This is "coherence strain"—the energetic cost of holding form under stress. In the language of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`), this is the struggle to maintain `Laminar Flow` as resistance increases.

2.  **The Yield Point (The Tearing):** Every system has a limit to its elasticity. The yield point is the moment where the cost of maintaining coherence becomes unsustainable. At a critical fault line on the coherence manifold—usually where the gradient of temporal pressure is steepest—a single resonant bond fails.

3.  **The Cascade (The Unraveling):** The failure of one bond is the catalyst for a chain reaction. The potential energy stored in that bond is released as a shockwave of dissonant noise, violently increasing the local `Γ` for its neighbors. This instantaneous spike in pressure causes them to fail, releasing more energy, and so on. This is the **Coherence Cascade**: a self-sustaining, explosive conversion of stored order into chaotic energy.
