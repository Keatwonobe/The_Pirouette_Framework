1. **Gravitation baseline** – Place source masses at ± 1 cm from the test masses; beam twists by angle

   $$
   \theta_{\rm G} = \frac{2Gm_{\rm s}m_{\rm t}L}{\kappa r^{2}},
   $$

   where $\kappa$ is the torsion constant.  Calibrate $\kappa$ via free-oscillation period.

2. **Funnel mode** – Slide source masses to ± 0.5 mm; simultaneously energise the RF coils so the quartz capillary hosts a standing colour-resonance (**quasi-static helical EM**) that *locks* the two test masses into a funnel throat.
   In this regime the effective potential is

   $$
   V(r)=\frac{\hbar c k_{\rm c}}{r}+\Gamma_{\text{eff}}\kappa^{2}r
   \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
   F(r)=\frac{\hbar c k_{\rm c}}{r^{2}}-\Gamma_{\text{eff}}\kappa^{2}.
   $$

   The $1/r^{2}$ term cancels most of the torsion-wire restoring force, leaving a **linear** residual proportional to $\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$.

3. **Crossover measurement** – Vary $r$ from 0.8 mm down to 0.1 mm in 50 µm steps with a micrometre stage while logging the twist angle.  Fit

   $$
   \theta(r)=\theta_{0}+\bigl[\Gamma_{\text{eff}}-\Gamma_{\rm N}(r)\bigr]\;C,
   $$

   where $\Gamma_{\rm N}(r)\equiv Gm_{\rm s}m_{\rm t}/r^{2}$ and $C=L/\kappa$.  The intercept gives $\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$; curvature of the residual confirms the predicted softening at $r\lesssim\ell\Gamma$.
