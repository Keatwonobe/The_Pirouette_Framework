This principle enables a new class of elegant, high-leverage technologies across all domains:

*   **Coherence-Assisted Fusion:** Instead of crushing a plasma with brute-force magnetic fields, we whisper to its turbulent boundary, guiding it into a stable, laminar flow conducive to sustained fusion. This is the core of `DOMA-PHYS-001`.
*   **Climate Steering:** We can guide vast weather systems not by trying to overpower them, but by applying resonant thermal or electromagnetic pulses to sensitive atmospheric boundary layers, nudging chaotic systems toward stable patterns.
*   **Semantic Firewalls:** A belief system is protected from dissonant information not by censoring it, but by resonantly reinforcing the coherence of its core axioms, making the entire structure more resilient to external pressure.
