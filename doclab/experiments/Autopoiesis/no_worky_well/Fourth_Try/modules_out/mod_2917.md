To find a new item is to find a new way to see the world. A sword is not just a sharp piece of metal; it is a choice between a measured strike and a final, shattering blow. A ward is not just armor; it is a breath, a rhythm of defense and recovery. In this world, the greatest heroes are not just those with the most power, but those who have collected the most interesting toys, and have mastered the unique, wonderful, and dangerous games that each one plays.
