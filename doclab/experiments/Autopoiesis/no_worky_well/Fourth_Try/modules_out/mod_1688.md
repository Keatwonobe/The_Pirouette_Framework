The prior framework's Reverse Pareto Analysis was the work of a cartographer, mapping how systems disperse influence to maintain stability. This was an important but passive inquiry. The modern Weaver requires the tool of a surgeon: a method not just for mapping the terrain of health, but for finding the precise origin of the wound.

The Pareto Probe is that instrument. It re-establishes the analysis not as a study of stabilizing dispersion, but as a hunt for destabilizing concentration. It inverts the common application of the Pareto principle (the 80/20 rule). Instead of finding the 20% of inputs that create 80% of success, this instrument is calibrated to find the **critical few causes responsible for the vast majority of a system's failures**. It is a diagnostic protocol for moving from the symptom—a general loss of coherence—to the source: the specific bottleneck, the flawed assumption, the dissonant actor.
