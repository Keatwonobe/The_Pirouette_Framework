Any ailment in any system can be diagnosed as one of three fundamental pathologies of coherence, which map directly to the flow states defined in DYN-001.

Coherence Atrophy (The Stagnant Dam):

Description: This pathology arises from a blockage in a critical flow, leading to a "coherence desert" downstream and a dangerous pressure build-up upstream. It is the "poison of absence."

Pirouette Dynamics: A state of Stagnant Flow. A vital piece of information or a necessary resource is not reaching its destination.

Manifestations: A blocked artery in an organism; a critical supply chain failure in an economy; a repressed trauma in a psyche; a team waiting on a single decision-maker.

Coherence Fever (The Turbulent Storm):

Description: A state of systemic dissonance where the system is fighting itself. Energy is wasted in chaotic, internal friction instead of being used for productive function. It is an "information storm."

Pirouette Dynamics: A state of Turbulent Flow. The system's Ki has become internally dissonant, creating destructive interference patterns.

Manifestations: An autoimmune disorder in an organism; a market crash fueled by panic in an economy; a debilitating anxiety attack in a psyche; a team plagued by infighting and conflicting goals.

Coherence Erosion (The Fraying Thread):

Description: The slow, gradual degradation of a system's core resonant pattern. The system loses its memory, its form, and its ability to self-correct.

Pirouette Dynamics: A failure of the Wound Channel (CORE-011) to maintain the system's Ki against the constant pressure of entropy, as described in CORE-013.

Manifestations: Chronic degenerative disease or aging in an organism; the slow decay of infrastructure in a city; the loss of cultural identity in a society; the fading of a skill through disuse.
