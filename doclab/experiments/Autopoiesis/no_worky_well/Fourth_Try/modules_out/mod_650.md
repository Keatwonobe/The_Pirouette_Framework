While electromagnetism describes how systems interact, the Gladiator Force describes why they form structures at all. It is the universe's principle of self-containment, derived from a non-linear, scale-dependent feedback loop within the Pirouette Lagrangian itself. The act of "being" creates a pressure that resists that very act, forging an arena of stability.

*   **The Quantum Arena (The Strong Force):** At the sub-atomic scale, this feedback is extreme. Quarks move freely when close together (asymptotic freedom) but experience an exponentially rising temporal pressure ($V_\Gamma$) if they try to separate. The "cost" of coherence becomes infinite with distance, trapping them in a bond so strong that trying to break it only creates more particles. This is confinement.

*   **The Cosmological Arena (Gravity):** At the cosmic scale, the same principle operates in a gentler, more linear fashion. A massive object like a star creates a deep "coherence well" by increasing the surrounding Temporal Pressure (Γ). An orbiting planet is not being pulled; it is following the geodesic—the path of least resistance and maximal coherence—within this well. Gravity is the Gladiator Force acting as a gentle, cosmic arena.
