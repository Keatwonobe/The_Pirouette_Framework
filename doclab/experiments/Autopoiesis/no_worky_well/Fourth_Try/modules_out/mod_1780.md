A system is not defined by what it is doing, but by what it *can* do. A river can flow or flood; a mind can be focused or scattered. These are not random behaviors but preferred modes of being—stable valleys and peaks in the landscape of possibility. The old analysis of System Modal Stability sought to catalog these states; the new framework provides the map of the entire landscape.

This module refactors that insight into a more powerful model. A system's operational modes are distinct, stable, high-order **Ki resonances**—the collection of viable, self-sustaining songs it has learned to sing. This set of songs is its **Resonant Repertoire**. This module provides the "Atlas of States"—a method for mapping this repertoire and understanding the landscape upon which its performance unfolds.
