For triadic fields ψ1,ψ2,ψ3 with constraint f3=f1+f2 (COG-RES-001), add

F_tri = − g ∫ |ψ1||ψ2||ψ3| cos(Φ1+Φ2−Φ3) d^d x

RG to lowest order:

β_g = y_g g − ρ b g + O(g^3),  with  y_g = d + ζ1+ζ2+ζ3 − Δ_tri

Δ_tri is the naive scaling dimension of the composite. At the WF point, small g is marginally relevant if y_g>0, yielding a **locked-triad fixed surface** with reduced fluctuations in the resonant subspace—formalizing the consciousness triad as an RG-selected manifold.
