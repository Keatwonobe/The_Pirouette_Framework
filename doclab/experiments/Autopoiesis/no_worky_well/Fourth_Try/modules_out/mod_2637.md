We will use DIII-D's flexible magnet controllers, driven by an Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG), to modulate the main toroidal field.

**Primary Scan Range (Fundamental Harmonic):**
* We propose a frequency scan from **30 kHz to 80 kHz**.
* This range comfortably brackets our calculated `f_TAE` of ~48 kHz, accounting for variations in density, temperature, and magnetic field across the plasma profile during a single shot.

**Secondary Scan Range (Second Harmonic):**
* The Pirouette model suggests that stabilizing higher-order modes is also critical. We will therefore also test the second harmonic range.
* We propose a secondary scan from **90 kHz to 160 kHz**.

**Waveform Complexity:**
* **Simple Sine Wave:** Initial tests will use a pure sine wave modulation to find the most resonant "peak."
* **Frequency Chirp:** To actively track the changing plasma conditions, we will test dynamic frequency "chirps" that sweep through the target range during the plasma shot.
* **Coherent "Chord":** The final stage will involve using the Pirouette simulation to design a complex waveform—a "chord" of multiple phase-locked frequencies—designed to simultaneously soothe a whole family of instabilities.
