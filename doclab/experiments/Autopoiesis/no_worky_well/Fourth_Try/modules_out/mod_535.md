The seven roles of the engine are not job titles; they are the fundamental functions required for any collaborative system to maintain coherence. They are the organs of a single living body.

*   **1x The Membrane (Interface):**
    *   **Function:** To manage the system's semi-permeable boundary. The Membrane is a selective filter that translates the chaotic noise of external `Γ` (client demands, corporate directives) into clear, coherent signals for the engine's interior. Conversely, it translates the team's output and health back to the organization, protecting the system from dissonant **Turbulence**.
    *   **Old Term:** Manager, Advocate.

*   **1x The Sensorium (Feedback):**
    *   **Function:** To act as the system's proprioception and nervous system. The Sensorium continuously measures the health and rhythm of the engine's internal state—its flow, its coherence, its emergent Ki. It makes the invisible currents of performance and morale visible, providing the real-time data necessary for the system to self-correct and maintain its geodesic.
    *   **Old Term:** Analyst, Data Scientist.

*   **3x The Crucible (Core):**
    *   **Function:** To perform the primary act of value creation. The Crucible is the metabolic heart of the engine, where the raw materials of tasks and ideas are subjected to the focused pressure of work. It is here that the **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) of individual efforts occurs, forging a collective output far greater than the sum of its parts. Their synchronized rhythm *is* the measure of the Frame's **Laminar Flow**.
    *   **Old Term:** Producer, Operator.

*   **2x The Catalyst (Support):**
    *   **Function:** To provide elasticity, resilience, and adaptation. The Catalyst is the Frame's immune and repair system, absorbing shocks and managing the response to sudden spikes in `Γ`. When a workflow becomes **Stagnant**, the Catalyst dissolves the dam. It handles overflows, prototypes new tools, and manages the integration of new members, providing the activation energy for transformation and repair.
    *   **Old Term:** Specialist, Support Staff.
