To assess a plan's viability, we model it as a dynamic system governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. A plan is considered robust if it proposes a path that maximizes the integral of its own Lagrangian over its intended duration.

**𝓛_plan = K_τ(plan) - V_Γ(environment)**

-   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** This term represents the plan's internal power and integrity—the "kinetic energy" of the intent. High coherence arises from:
    -   **Clarity:** A sharply defined, unambiguous objective.
    -   **Consistency:** Internal logic where actions support goals and sub-goals do not conflict.
    -   **Alignment:** Resources, skills, and personnel are harmonically matched to the required tasks.
    A plan with high K_τ is a clear, powerful signal projected into the future.

-   **Environmental Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** This term represents the "potential energy" or the cost of executing the plan. It is the ambient chaos, friction, and resistance of the operational environment. High pressure arises from:
    -   **Uncertainty:** Volatility, unpredictable events.
    -   **Competition:** The actions of other agents casting their own interfering imprints.
    -   **Constraints:** Scarcity of resources, regulatory hurdles, or physical laws.
    A plan facing high V_Γ must possess exceptionally high internal coherence (K_τ) to succeed. A "good" plan is a resonant solution to its environment, finding the path of maximal coherence for minimal cost.
