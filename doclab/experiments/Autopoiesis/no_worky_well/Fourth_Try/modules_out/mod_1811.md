We mistake the stone for the prayer. A cathedral is not a collection of rocks; it is a durable pattern that has successfully channeled the ceaseless pressure of gravity for centuries. Its form is a memory of a successful resonance, a slow-moving process written in stone.

This module refactors the old structural analysis into a time-first model. A system's structure is not its static arrangement of parts, but the persistent, standing wave of coherence that flows through it. This wave is sustained by a deeply carved Ki pattern—its chosen architecture. The function of this architecture is to create stable channels, or geodesics, for the flow of coherence (energy, information, physical load) through the landscape of ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). By analyzing the health of these flows, we can diagnose the integrity, efficiency, and resilience of any system.
