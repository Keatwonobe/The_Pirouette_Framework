The personas can be used as a heuristic model for rapidly triaging a text's core nature based on its quantitative signature:

| Step | Metric | If... | Then... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Assess Texture** | **Kurtosis (Kᵢ)** | **High** | The text has a "brittle," uneven structure. Proceed to assess stability. |
| | | **Low** | The text has a "malleable," uniform structure. Likely a **Malleable Reflection**. |
| **2. Assess Stability** | **Drift (∂μ/∂flips)** | **Negative** | The structure is fragile and decays. Likely a **Brittle Dogma**. |
| | | **Near-Zero** | The structure is stable. Could be a **Complex Strategy** or other rigid form. |
