This protocol introduces a universal, scale-invariant language for describing entity behavior, called the Behavioral Triad. This is a triaxial system designed to describe the dynamic nature or interactive posture of any system, from a quark to a galaxy to a living organism. It moves beyond labeling forces (effects) to describing the fundamental geometric and relational actions (causes) that produce those forces. The three axes of this grammar are: Vector, Cohesion, and Communion.
