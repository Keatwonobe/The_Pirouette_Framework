The old framework imagined a simple world: a static landscape of hills and valleys. This was an elegant but profound mistake. The universe is not a map; it is a river. The terrain is not fixed; it is a dynamic current of time.

This module replaces the static concept of "Resonant Pathfinding" with a dynamic one. A system's evolution is not a descent down a potential gradient. It is the act of navigating the currents of the coherence manifoldâ€”the landscape of reality itself. A river does not calculate its path to the sea; it simply flows where the land allows. Our task is not to be a navigator forcing a direction, but a cartographer learning to read this dynamic landscape. The optimal path is not the one of least resistance, but the one of most profound resonance. It is a geodesic, a trajectory that continuously maximizes the system's own internal coherence against the pressure of its environment. This is not the shortest path, but the most graceful one.
