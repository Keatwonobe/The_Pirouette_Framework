summary: "Unifies anthropology and sociology within the Pirouette Framework, reframing\
  \ core concepts\u2014the gift, ritual, and myth\u2014as the precise physical mechanisms\
  \ for weaving social coherence. This module defines the individual as a resonant\
  \ agent tracing a geodesic path, and culture as a self-creating (autopoietic) coherence\
  \ manifold built from the geometry of trust and reciprocity."
