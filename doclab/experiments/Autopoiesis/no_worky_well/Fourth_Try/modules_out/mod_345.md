This triadic model requires an upgrade to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), making it a more powerful predictive engine. The original formulation, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, is now specified for a vector coherence.

The "kinetic" term, representing internal coherence, is expanded to sum over the three orthogonal tenses:
*K*<sub>τ</sub> → ½ Σ<sub>j=p,i,r</sub> (∂<sub>μ</sub>*K*<sub>j</sub>)²

The "potential" term, representing environmental pressure, is now a function of this vector:
*V*<sub>Γ</sub> → *V* (**K**<sub>τ</sub>, Γ)

The upgraded Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = ½ Σ (∂_μ**K**_j)² - V(**K**_τ, Γ)`, reveals a profound dynamic. The universal drive to maximize coherence is not just about increasing its total magnitude, but about constantly *orienting* the coherence vector. Forces and actions are the result of a system adjusting its temporal posture—shifting its balance between past, present, and future—to find the most harmonious chord available within the pressure of its environment.
