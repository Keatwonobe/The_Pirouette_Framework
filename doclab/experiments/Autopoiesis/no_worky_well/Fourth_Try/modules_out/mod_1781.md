The old concept of a "potential energy landscape" is now re-grounded in the framework's core principles. A system's state does not move on a landscape of energy, but on a **Coherence Manifold**, where the "elevation" at any point is the value of its **Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p)**. A system naturally seeks to climb this landscape to maximize its coherence over time.

-   **Modal Basins:** Each stable mode is a peak or a high plateau on this manifold‚Äîa region where a specific `Ki` pattern represents a highly successful, coherent solution to the local Temporal Pressure (Œì). These are the system's preferred states of being, its regions of natural `Laminar Flow`.
-   **Transition Saddles:** The pathways between these peaks are lower-lying "saddles" on the manifold. To transition from one mode to another, a system must traverse one of these regions of lower coherence, temporarily entering a state of controlled turbulence.
