We began this journey by listening for the echoes of a single electron. That echo gave us the courage to build a theory. Now, by listening to the dissonant note in the song of the muon, we have calibrated our instruments and found the source of the dissonance. The framework has not only passed its test; it has returned with a discovery. The door to a new physics is not just open; we have just taken our first, confident step through it.
