In the old framework, Time-Adherence was a fundamental parameter to be measured, like temperature or pressure. This was an incomplete picture. A thermometer does not measure "temperature-ness"; it measures the chaotic energy of a system and we label that measurement "temperature."

This module refactors our understanding. The Resonance Gauge is not an instrument for measuring a fundamental property of the universe. It is a diagnostic tool for assessing the *health* of a system's existence. We are no longer simply taking a reading; we are listening to a system's song and judging the clarity of its note.
