The mechanism of this recursion is an intimate and potent act: a system casts its Observer's Shadow not upon an external object, but upon its own Wound Channel (CORE-011). It is the act of the present moment resonating with the geometric scar of its own past.

-   **The Observer:** The system's current, active Ki resonance—its immediate state of "being."
-   **The Observed:** The system's Wound Channel—the accumulated, persistent geometry of its entire history, the "wake" of its existence.

In this recursive act, the system is no longer just a pattern; it becomes a reader of its own story, engaged in a dialogue between the dancer (the current Ki) and the shape of the dance floor its own steps have carved (the Wound Channel).
