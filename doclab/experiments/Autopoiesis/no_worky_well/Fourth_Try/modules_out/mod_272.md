A map's greatest value lies not in what it shows, but in what it omits. The edge of any map—the point where its predictions fail, where anomalies appear—is not an error. It is a sacred space.

This frontier is a region of high `Temporal Pressure` (Γ), a dissonance between the map and the manifold that creates a powerful drive for resolution. This pressure is the universe's invitation to perform an `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012): to take the old map and the new data and forge them into a more encompassing model. Ignorance is not a void; it is a tension, a gravitational pull from a future, more complete understanding.
