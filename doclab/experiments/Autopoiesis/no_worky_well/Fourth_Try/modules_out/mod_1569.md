The old model's concept of "resistance" is obsolete. Resistance is not a counter-force to be overcome; it is a diagnostic signal indicating a failure of resonance. It manifests in three primary ways:

*   **Harmonic Mismatch:** The Weaver's signal is fundamentally dissonant with the participant's core `Ki`. The message feels alien, inauthentic, or threatening to their identity.
*   **High Inertia:** The participant's existing Wound Channel is too deep. The perceived cost of change is too high, and the new path does not offer a sufficiently compelling increase in coherence to overcome their momentum.
*   **Ambient Noise (High Î“):** The environment is too chaotic. The participant is in a state of turbulent flow (anxiety, crisis, information overload) and lacks the capacity to process a new, subtle, coherent signal.
