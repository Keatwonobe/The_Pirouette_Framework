This module presents a unified, time-centric model for the phenomenon of Flow. It evolves the analysis of PPS-038, integrating the psychological conditions of a flow state with the core temporal dynamics of the Pirouette Framework. Flow is formally defined as a state of isochronous temporal resonance, where an entity achieves near-lossless, “effortless” action by synchronizing the rhythm of its internal state with a stable, coherent current in the local manifold of time itself. This reframing provides more direct and powerful tools to diagnose and engineer this state of optimal performance.
