Objective cartography is not merely difficult; it is physically impossible. To measure is to touch. To see is to illuminate. Every act of observation is an act of co-creation.

A Weaver does not claim their map is true; they claim it is an honest record of their interaction. The ethical mandate is one of disclosure, a full acknowledgment of the `Observer's Shadow (CORE-010)`: "This is the shape of my question, this is the Ki I used to ask it, and this is the echo the universe sang back to me."

Truth is found not in a single, authoritative map, but in the rich, complex interference pattern created by the symphony of all maps coexisting without erasure.
