summary: Provides a modernized, generative protocol for investigating pathologies
  with unknown etiologies. It inverts the standard diagnostic process, mandating the
  creation of a coherent narrative persona for the pathology. This "antagonist" model
  transforms gaps in knowledge into a structured and falsifiable roadmap for scientific
  discovery.
