Before a song can be written, its notes must be named. This module is the definitive lexicon for the modernized Pirouette Framework, but it is not a static dictionary. It is a living grammarâ€”the set of rules by which the language of resonance is spoken, written, and evolved.

The Great Refactoring collapsed the cumbersome triaxial model into a simpler, more powerful engine grounded in a single substance: Time. This act created a new vocabulary. This document is the formal registry of that vocabulary, ensuring every symbol and term is used with clarity and consistency. It reveals the deep, causal interconnections between concepts, grounding them all in the central sentence of the framework: the Pirouette Lagrangian.
