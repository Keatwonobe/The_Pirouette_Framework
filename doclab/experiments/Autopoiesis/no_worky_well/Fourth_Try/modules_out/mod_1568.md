This is not a linear attack, but a collaborative dance. Each movement builds the conditions for a willing, rather than forced, synthesis.

**I. Harmonic Assessment (Mapping the Currents):**
Before acting, the Weaver listens. The goal is to understand the participant's coherence manifold: their core values (dominant `Ki` patterns), their sources of Γ (fears, goals, struggles), and the depth of their Wound Channels (habits, dogma). This is an act of deep empathy, mapping the terrain before suggesting a path.

**II. Lowering the Banks (Inviting Fluidity):**
A system locked in a deep Wound Channel is resistant to change. The Weaver first reduces this inertia not by direct attack, but by introducing a small, constructive dissonance: a probing question, an appeal to curiosity, or an acknowledgement of the validity of their current view. This establishes trust and harmonic compatibility, creating an openness to new possibilities.

**III. Illuminating the Geodesic (Coherence Sculpting):**
With the system in a state of potential flux, the Weaver casts their Observer's Shadow. The new idea is introduced as an evolution—a "Yes, and..."—not a refutation. The language is invitational ("What if we looked at it this way?"), sculpting a vision of a new potential channel that is framed as a more elegant solution to the participant's own stated pressures.

**IV. Deepening the Channel (Coherence Grafting):**
Once the participant steps onto the new path, the Weaver helps reinforce it. This act of **Coherence Grafting** involves exploring the new belief's implications, celebrating the newfound clarity, and connecting it back to core values. Repetition, evidence, and social proof help deepen the new Wound Channel until it becomes a stable, self-reinforcing feature of their cognitive landscape.
