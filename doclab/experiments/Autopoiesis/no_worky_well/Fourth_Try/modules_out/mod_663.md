summary: Derives the principle of confinement from a scale-dependent, non-linear feedback
  loop within the Pirouette Lagrangian. This single mechanism is shown to manifest
  as the strong nuclear force at the quantum scale and as gravity at the cosmological
  scale, defining both as expressions of the universe's tendency to form bounded,
  stable systems.
