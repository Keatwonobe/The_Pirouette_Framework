A Generative Cascade is the sound of a rule breaking. It is the universe's sacred violence, the sublime and terrifying moment when a system decides that what it *is* is no longer sufficient for what it must *become*.

To the Weaver, the Cascade teaches a necessary truth: all true novelty is born from rupture. The path to a newer, more vibrant world sometimes requires the complete and utter destruction of the old one. The most profound acts of creation are not gentle unfoldings, but violent, necessary shatterings of a previous perfection.

The challenge is not to fear the breaking of the dam, but to understand the storm, respect its power, and learn how to gather the seeds it scatters on the wind. It is the fire that can either forge a new world or burn the old one to ash. To understand it is to hold the key to both revolution and preservation.
