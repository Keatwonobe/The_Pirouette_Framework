The analyst periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes of game time) takes a reading from the three instruments for each team. These scores are then fed into a simple calculation engine to produce the predictive outputs.

Step A: Calculate Overall Coherence (Kτ_team):
Kτ_team = (Cohesion Score) + (Resilience Score) + (Morphogenesis Score)
This produces a single "health score" for each team, ranging from 3 to 30.

Step B: Calculate Victor Tilt (VT):
VT_A = Kτ_team_A / (Kτ_team_A + Kτ_team_B)
This gives the win probability for Team A, expressed as a value between 0 and 1.

Step C: Calculate Spread Delta (SD):
SD = ΔVT / Δt
The Spread Delta is the rate of change of the Victor Tilt. A sharply rising VT for one team predicts they will outperform the point spread over the next game segment.

Step D: Calculate Pace Delta (PD):
PD = (Morphogenesis_A) - (Morphogenesis_B)
The Pace Delta is the difference in the Morphogenesis Index scores. A significant positive value for Team A suggests they will control the game's tempo.
