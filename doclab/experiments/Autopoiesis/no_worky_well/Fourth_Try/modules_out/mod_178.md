Interpretation: Γ is a classical, coherently oscillating scalar whose quanta (“pressurons”) have mass m_Γ. A galactic‑scale ‘condensate’ need not be a thermal BEC; the cosmological mechanism is **misalignment**: Γ starts displaced from its minimum in the early universe; Hubble friction freezes it (Γ̇≈0) until H≈m_Γ, after which Γ oscillates and time‑averages to a **pressureless fluid**.

Key points:
• Coherence length is set by the classical field, not the Compton wavelength; large‑scale homogeneity is from inflationary initial conditions and Hubble friction.
• Number conservation is approximate only if an accidental shift symmetry yields an adiabatic invariant; otherwise treat Γ as a condensed classical field.
• If m_Γ≈O(MeV), Γ begins oscillating extremely early (T≫MeV); it behaves like CDM thereafter. Late‑time DE behavior requires a shallow tail in V(Γ) that slows the background today (see Sec. 5).
