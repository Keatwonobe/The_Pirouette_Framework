1. **Introduce Variance Term**  
   \[
     \mathcal{O}' = |H_p - H_t| + \lambda\,D + \mu\,\sigma_{H_p}
   \]  
   to penalize uniformity and preserve local fluctuations.  
2. **Agent-Specific Constraints**  
   \[
     H_p^{\min} \le H_p \le H_p^{\max}
     \quad\text{and}\quad
     D \ge D^{\mathrm{threshold}}
   \]  
   ensuring both minimum autonomy and residual entropy safeguards.  
3. **Test Prescription**  
   - Run paired cycles with and without variance term.  
   - Compare systemic \(D\) and measures of agent satisfaction (\(\Phi\)).
