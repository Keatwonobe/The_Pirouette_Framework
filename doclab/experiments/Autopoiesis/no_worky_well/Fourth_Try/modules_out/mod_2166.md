Let the state of a resonance in the coherence field be described by a complex function Psi(x, t), where Psi is a spinor. A spinor is a mathematical object that, unlike a simple vector, must be rotated by a full 720 degrees to return to its original state.

The core claim of the Pirouette Framework is that this spinor nature is not a fundamental axiom, but a description of the resonance's path. We model this path as a function P(theta) in a complex plane, where theta is the angle of rotation. A simple scalar particle (spin-0) would have a path P(theta) = exp(i*theta), which returns to its starting point after a 360° rotation (theta = 2*pi).

For an electron, we posit a "Möbius-like" path:

P(theta) = exp(i*theta/2)

Let's test this function:

At theta = 0: P(0) = exp(0) = 1. This is our starting point.

At theta = 360 degrees (2*pi): P(2*pi) = exp(i*pi) = -1. The particle has rotated 360° but is now in the opposite phase. It has not returned to its original state.

At theta = 720 degrees (4*pi): P(4*pi) = exp(i*2*pi) = 1. The particle has returned to its original state only after two full rotations.

This mathematical form perfectly models the behavior of a spin-1/2 particle. This is the foundation of our proof: an electron is a resonance whose fundamental rhythm travels a 720° path.
