The environment is not trying to have a conversation; it is trying to kill you.

Mechanic: The GM presents challenges that target a character's attributes. A chasm might require a Strength check to cross. A patch of poisonous berries requires an Intelligence check to identify. A hidden pitfall requires a Dexterity check to avoid. Failure results in damage as entropy.

The Goal: The players must successfully overcome these challenges to find the resources (food, water, shelter) they need, all while defending their own entropy pools from the environment's relentless assault.
