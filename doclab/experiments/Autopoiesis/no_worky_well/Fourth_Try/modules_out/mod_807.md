summary: "Synthesizes and replaces PPS-054. This module defines the Genesis Knot as\
  \ the first stable, self-creating (autopoietic) wound in time, a topological scar\
  \ from the universe's inaugural act. Its 8-lobed geometry forms the Macroparticle\
  \ Lattice\u2014a spectrum of allowed resonances. This primordial shape is posited\
  \ as the geometric origin of fundamental laws, defining quark charge as a 'geometric\
  \ address' and confinement as a 'topological trap'."
