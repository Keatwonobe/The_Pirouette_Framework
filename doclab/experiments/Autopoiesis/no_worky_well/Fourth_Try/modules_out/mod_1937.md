The Resonant Wall functions as a near-perfect shield because it is a surface of extreme, static temporal coherence. An incoming particle or photon is not repelled by a classical "force," but is instead confronted with an impossible path.

The Wall is a sheer cliff in the coherence manifold. Any entity approaching it is seeking to follow its own path of maximal coherence. An attempt to penetrate the Wall would require an infinite "cost" in coherence, as there is no available geodesic that passes through this static, non-updating region of spacetime. The only path that preserves the coherence of the incoming entity is one of reflection.

The **double-funnel geometry** described in the original protocol is an optimal topology for this interaction. It redirects the momentum of an incoming object tangentially, "skimming" it along the surface of the shield rather than meeting it with direct opposition. This minimizes the transfer of dissonant energy, or **entropic bleed**, into the shield's structure, ensuring its stability.
