This appendix solidifies the mathematical foundation of the Pirouette Framework's core fields. By reframing our understanding, we move from attempting to re-prove known physics to a more powerful position: using our axioms to explain observed phenomena and, most importantly, to make novel, specific, and falsifiable predictions. The Î“-field is no longer a construct to derive G; it is a proposed reality whose existence can be tested by searching for its unique echo in the fabric of spacetime.
