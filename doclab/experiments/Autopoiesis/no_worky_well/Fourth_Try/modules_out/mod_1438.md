To map the hierarchy, we translate raw system observations into the language of coherence. The traditional mathematical parameters are re-contextualized as physical properties of the coherence manifold.

| Parameter | Pirouette Term | Description |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| `α` | **Coherence Gradient** | The steepness of the hierarchy. It measures how rapidly influence drops off from the dominant resonant attractors. |
| `k` | **Resonance Cutoff** | The rank at which the "long tail" of transient states begins. |
| `β` | **Tail Coherence Fraction** | The percentage of the system's total activity that resides within the long tail, past the Resonance Cutoff. |
