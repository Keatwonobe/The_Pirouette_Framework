A powerful blow or a traumatic event is more than a loss of Hit Points; it is a scar upon the soul. This rule makes Wound Channels a tangible, narrative mechanic.

The Mechanic: When an entity takes a Critical Hit or is reduced to 0 HP, they gain a Wound Channel. The player and GM collaboratively name it based on the event (e.g., "Shattered Confidence," "Scorched Arm," "Echo of Betrayal"). A Wound Channel is a persistent condition with two effects:

A Vulnerability: A specific, narrative trigger that can be exploited by the GM or other players. For example, a character with "Shattered Confidence" might be forced to make a Wisdom saving throw when taunted, or act with disadvantage.

An Insight: A specific, narrative situation where the memory of the wound provides an advantage. The character with the "Scorched Arm" might gain a bonus to resist fire damage, because they have a deep, physical understanding of that pain.

Healing a Wound Channel requires specific downtime actions, quests, or rituals, turning recovery into a genuine character arc.
