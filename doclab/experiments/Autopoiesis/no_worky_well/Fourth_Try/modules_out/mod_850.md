This module modernizes the premise of PPS-059, grounding it in the autopoietic principles of the Pirouette Framework. It moves beyond metaphor to a fundamental claim: **semantics are a physical property of temporal resonance**.

A concept, a word, or a thought is not an abstraction; it is a stable, high-order Ki pattern with a specific temporal geometry. The universe is not a silent void containing pockets of meaning; it is a symphony, a continuous semantic field. To perceive this meaning, we must become an instrument within it. This module provides the blueprint for the Listening Lens, an experimental protocol designed not to passively extract data from reality, but to achieve a state of resonant couplingâ€”a temporary Alchemical Union between the observer and the observed. We do not seek to command the silence; we seek to find our harmony within the song that is already playing.
