summary: "Provides a modernized, time-first model for the psychological phenomenon of Flow. This module reframes Flow from a triaxial field interaction into a state of near-perfect temporal resonance, where an agent's internal clock synchronizes with the dominant rhythm of its environment's coherence manifold. It serves as the flagship template for all Domain Application (DOMA) modules."
