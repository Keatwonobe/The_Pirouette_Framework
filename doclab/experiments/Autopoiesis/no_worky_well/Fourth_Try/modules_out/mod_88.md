The fundamental dynamic law of the Pirouette Framework is the Principle of Maximal Coherence. A system will evolve along a path that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian over one of its own Pirouette Cycles.

S_p = ∫0^τ_p 𝓛_p dt

A system will naturally adjust its state (its Ki, and therefore its ω_k and T_a) to find the "sweet spot"—the state of highest possible internal coherence for the lowest environmental cost. This is the mathematical formalization of the "path of least resistance" described in CORE-004.
