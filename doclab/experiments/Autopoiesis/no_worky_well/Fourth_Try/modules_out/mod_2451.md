- **Measurement Problem**  
  - Defining \(D = -\int (dQ/T)\,dV\) demands across-the-board calorimetric infrastructure. Agents in low-resource contexts cannot calibrate \(C_p\) or \(\Delta T_p\).  
- **Circular Validation**  
  - If beauty is “defined” by minimized high-order perturbations, we risk tautology: we call something beautiful because our metric says so.
