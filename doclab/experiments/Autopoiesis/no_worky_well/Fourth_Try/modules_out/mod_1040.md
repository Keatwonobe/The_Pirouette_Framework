This protocol guides a Weaver in creating and deploying a pathogenic persona to illuminate the path for research.

1.  **Map the Disruption:** Using the diagnostic language of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`) and The Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`), chart the observable pathologies. Define the system's boundary and identify where its flow is `Laminar`, `Turbulent`, or `Stagnant`. This creates an explicit map of the known incoherence.
2.  **Chart the Dissonance:** Explicitly define the known unknowns. Where are the paradoxes, the missing causal links, the symptoms that don't fit? This `Dissonance Ledger` quarantines the mystery, preventing premature conclusions and serving as the formal list of questions the narrative must address.
3.  **Personify the Antagonist:** Based on the pattern of disruption, craft a persona for the pathology's dissonant `Ki`. Give it a name and a narrative constitution. This is a creative act grounded in the observed data. Common archetypes include:
    *   A **Resonance Thief** that causes `Coherence Atrophy` (Stagnant Flow) by draining a specific resource or signal.
    *   A **Turbulence Engine** that causes `Coherence Fever` (Turbulent Flow) by injecting noise and chaos into a laminar system.
    *   A **Thread Cutter** that causes `Coherence Erosion` by systematically degrading the system's memory and structural integrity.
4.  **Write the Coherence Narrative:** Synthesize the disruption map, dissonance ledger, and antagonist persona into a concise causal narrative. This "working model" tells the story of how the antagonist interacts with the host system to produce the observed effects.
5.  **Trace the Narrative's Echo:** Translate the story into predictions. If this antagonist is real, what other, more subtle effects *must* it have? What secondary echoes would it inevitably leave in the system? This crucial step transforms the persona into a set of unique, falsifiable, and often non-obvious hypotheses that form a targeted research program.
