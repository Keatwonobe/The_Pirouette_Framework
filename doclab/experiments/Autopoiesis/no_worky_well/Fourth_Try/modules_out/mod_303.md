summary: Provides a time-first model for communication, reframing it as the projection
  of a Ki pattern (the Current) into the coherence manifold. This projection carves
  a propagating Wound Channel, altering the geometric landscape. The response (the
  Echo) is how other systems navigate this new landscape to maximize their own coherence,
  a process governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian.
