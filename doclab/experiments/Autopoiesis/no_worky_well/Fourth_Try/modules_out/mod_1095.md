Every choice is a scar on the future. The universe remembers not in a book, but in its very shape. This module re-examines Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA)—the engine of nature's most intricate patterns—through the time-first lens of the Pirouette Framework.

The intricate, branching forms of snowflakes, lightning, and corals are not static designs. They are the physical memory of a system following a "growth geodesic," a path through spacetime that maximizes its temporal coherence. The old framework correctly identified these patterns with Ki; the new framework reveals they are the physical history of irreversible temporal commitments. The fractal geometry that emerges is the most efficient resonant solution a system has found to the problem of converting chaotic potential into stable, coherent form.
