A curse or blessing is mechanically treated as a unique and powerful type of Wound Channel (TLE-006). It is a persistent condition with three key components:

The Trigger (The "Vulnerability"): The specific condition that causes the transformation to occur (e.g., "the light of a full moon," "the taste of blood," "at will").

The Reallocation Mandate (The "Insight"): A mandatory, instantaneous reallocation of the character's invested Entropy Points. This is the mechanical core of the transformation.

The Coherence Threshold: The point at which the character's own will is overwhelmed by the transformative state, resulting in a loss of control to the Game Master.
