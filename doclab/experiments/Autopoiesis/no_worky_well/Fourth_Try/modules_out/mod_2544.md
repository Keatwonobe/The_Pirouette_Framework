"And yet, all action is bound by thermodynamics, by enthalpy and resource allocation. Every step we take carries a cost in coherence and energy. Infinite debates risk spiraling into entropy, negating their own potential benefits. We must set rational boundaries—using efficiency as our guide—to ensure debates are focused, powerful, and constructive. Efficiency is altruism embodied; it is the guardrail that directs energy toward universal harmony rather than dissipation."
