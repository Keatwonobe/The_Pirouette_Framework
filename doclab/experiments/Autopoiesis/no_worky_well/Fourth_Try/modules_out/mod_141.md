This is the practical "tooling" for using the framework. To analyze any system, from any domain, follow these steps:

Define the System and Boundary: Clearly state what entity you are analyzing (the "instrument") and what constitutes its environment (the "orchestra").

Map the Core Variables: Using the table above as a guide, perform the translation. Identify the specific, measurable phenomena in your domain that correspond to Coherence (Kτ), Temporal Pressure (Γ), the Wound Channel, and the Alchemical Union. This is the most crucial step.

Locate the Geodesic: Apply the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). Knowing the system's drive to maximize coherence (its Kτ) against the local pressure (Γ), what is its most likely path of evolution? What behavior represents the "path of least resistance"? This is the predictive heart of the framework.

Identify Resonant Handshakes: Analyze the system's interactions with its environment. Where are the conditions for an Alchemical Union (CORE-012) being met? Where is the potential for a phase shift into a new, more complex state of being?
