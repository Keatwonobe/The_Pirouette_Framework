With both terms measured, the Sieve applies the central equation of the Pirouette Framework (`CORE-006`) to provide a direct, real-time measure of the system's net state.

The Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`):
`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`

For diagnostic clarity, the Sieve translates this into a dimensionless ratio: the **Coherence-Pressure Balance (CPB)**.

Coherence-Pressure Balance (CPB):
`CPB = Kτ / V_Γ`

The CPB is the single most important diagnostic metric in the framework. Its interpretation is immediate and universal:

*   **CPB > 1 (Healthy / Anabolic):** The system's internal coherence is overcoming environmental pressure. It is in a state of growth, health, and stability, successfully navigating its geodesic of maximal coherence.
*   **CPB ≈ 1 (Stable / Homeostatic):** The system is in equilibrium. It is efficiently using its energy to perfectly counteract the ambient pressure.
*   **CPB < 1 (Unhealthy / Catabolic):** Environmental pressure is overwhelming the system's ability to maintain coherence. The system is losing information, bleeding energy, and is in a state of decay or turbulence.
