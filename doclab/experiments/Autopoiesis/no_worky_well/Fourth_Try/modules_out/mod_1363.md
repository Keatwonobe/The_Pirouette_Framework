The temporal expression of the Fractal Geodesic is recursion—the act of a system iteratively following its own echo. Each iteration deepens a **Wound Channel** (CORE-011), reinforcing the pattern and making the path of least resistance even easier to follow. To analyze this generative process, we move beyond a simple description of its shape and measure the dynamic properties of its growth, collapsing the old cumbersome vectors into three core signatures:

1.  **Coherence Complexity `(D_f)`**: This is the classic Fractal Dimension, re-framed. It measures how effectively the generative `Ki` pattern fills its "possibility space" to create a stable structure against environmental pressure. A higher `D_f` indicates a more intricate and resilient solution to the problem of existence.

2.  **Inter-Scale Coherence `(T_a_scale)`**: This measures the fidelity of the self-similar pattern across different scales. It is the signal-to-noise ratio of the generative grammar itself. A high `T_a_scale` signifies a pure, well-preserved rule, like a crystal. A low `T_a_scale` suggests a more organic, noisy process, like a tree whose branches are shaped by the wind.

3.  **Generative Rhythm `(ω_g)`**: This is the fundamental frequency or "beat" of the recursive process. It is the temporal heartbeat of the fractal's growth, defining the characteristic scale of its primary iteration and the tempo at which it reinforces its own Wound Channel.
