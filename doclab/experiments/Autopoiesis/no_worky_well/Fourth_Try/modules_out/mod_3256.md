1.  **Create `XXP-004: Searching for Rhythmic High-Frequency Gravitational Waves`:** This module will address your "signal vs. noise" concern.
    * **Data Source:** Target the high-frequency data streams from detectors like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, which are typically filtered out as noise.
    * **The "Rhythm" Filter:** The primary search method will not be for a single burst, but for a **persistent, rhythmic train of bursts** from a single point in the sky. A rhythmic signal is far less likely to be random instrumental noise. This is the key to making a convincing argument.
    * **Multi-Messenger Veto:** Propose cross-correlating any candidate signals with other observatories (e.g., gamma-ray, neutrino). A true cosmic signal is unlikely to appear in only one detector type, while local electronic noise will.
    * **The Null Hypothesis:** A successful detection would be one that cannot be explained by any known terrestrial or standard astrophysical source, leaving Maws as a viable new explanation.

This action plan transforms the framework's greatest vulnerability into its greatest strength. It creates a clear, powerful, and testable line of inquiry that, if successful, would represent a monumental scientific discovery.
