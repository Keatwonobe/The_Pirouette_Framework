The first task is to translate the raw data of a network into the language of the Pirouette Framework. As per the Principle of Correspondence (CORE-014), we map domain-specific phenomena onto the universal variables. This protocol replaces the old, fragmented triaxial view (`Tₐ`, `Γ`, `φ`) with a unified dynamic.

*   **Node Coherence (Kτ):** This replaces `T_a_node`. It measures the stability and integrity of an individual node's resonant pattern. It is the purity of its rhythm.
    *   **Inference:** Look for regularity and predictability. In a social network, this is the consistency of a user's activity and role. In a power grid, it is the phase stability of a generator. In a brain, it is the coherence of a neural column's firing pattern.
    *   **Scaling:** `0` (pure noise) to `1` (a perfect, unwavering rhythm).

*   **Channel Pressure (Γ):** This replaces `Gamma_edge`. It quantifies the dissonance, friction, or resistance to flow between two connected nodes. It is the cost of interaction.
    *   **Inference:** Look for bottlenecks, antagonism, or latency. In a social network, this is the inverse of trust. In an organization, it is bureaucratic friction. In a power grid, it is line impedance.
    *   **Scaling:** `0` (a frictionless, perfectly resonant connection) to `1` (a complete blockage or "Coherence Dam").

*   **Temporal Phase (φ):** This remains a critical variable, describing the *timing* of a node's rhythm relative to a shared clock or its neighbors.
    *   **Inference:** Look for cyclical behavior. In a social network, this is the peak time of a user's posting cycle. In an economy, it is the phase of a business cycle. In a power grid, it is the literal phase angle of the AC signal.
    *   **Scaling:** Mapped to the circle `[0, 2π)`.
