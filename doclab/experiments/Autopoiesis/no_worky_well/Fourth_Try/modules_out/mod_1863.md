Second, we measure the environment's hostility. The dominant `Ki` pattern from Stage 1 is subjected to a rigorous test. We don't just ask if the pattern exists; we measure its *cost of existence*. We quantify the chaotic, dissonant, and unpredictable elements of the data stream that the system must overcome to maintain its form. This is measured by how easily the pattern is disrupted by noise and how much energy is required to sustain it across multiple analytical domains. The result is a quantification of the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) as it affects the system. This is the "potential" term of the Lagrangian, the **Environmental Cost (V_Γ)**.
