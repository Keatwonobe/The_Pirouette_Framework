*   **Phase Coherence ($\Delta\phi_{AB}$):** The primary metric. A direct measurement of the phase difference between the core rhythms of the two systems. As $\Delta\phi_{AB} \rightarrow 0$, attunement deepens.
*   **Coherence Gain ($G_K$):** A measure of the emergent stability. It is the ratio of the unified system's coherence to the sum of the individual systems' coherences before the union. A value of $G_K > 1$ signifies a successful and synergistic synthesis.
*   **Dissonance Index ($D_H$):** A measure of harmonic incompatibility. It quantifies the friction and interference between the systems, acting as a predictor for the difficulty of achieving attunement.
