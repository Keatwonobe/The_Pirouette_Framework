A being's territory can become a literal extension of their power.

Favored Ground: A character can perform a ritual to consecrate or desecrate a piece of land, aligning it with their own entropic nature. While on this favored ground, the character's ERR is increased by 1.

The Sentient Lair: By making a massive and permanent TEP investment into a location, a character can awaken it, turning their stronghold into a sentient Lair.

The Lair's Sheet: A Lair has its own character sheet, with a TEP, an ERR, and its own initiative in combat.

Lair Actions: On its turn, the Lair can use its ERR to power effects: grasping vines, shifting walls, sudden darkness, etc.

The Final Bastion: The owner of a Lair can, as an action, draw upon the Lair's permanently invested TEP to fuel their own abilities. This makes a villain in their lair a truly formidable foe, as an intruder must fight both the master and their entire domain at once.
