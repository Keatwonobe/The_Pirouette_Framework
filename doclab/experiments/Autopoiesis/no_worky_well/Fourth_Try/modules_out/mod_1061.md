*   **1-3 (Dissonant):** Frequent unforced errors, broken plays, visible frustration between players. Actions are chaotic and self-defeating.
*   **4-6 (Functional):** Standard execution, plays run as designed but without exceptional flow, some hesitation or inefficiency is present.
*   **7-8 (Harmonious):** Crisp, efficient execution; players are "in sync," anticipating each other's moves; complex plays look easy.
*   **9-10 (Telepathic):** A state of peak flow; improvisational, creative, and perfectly timed plays unfold, seemingly without effort.
