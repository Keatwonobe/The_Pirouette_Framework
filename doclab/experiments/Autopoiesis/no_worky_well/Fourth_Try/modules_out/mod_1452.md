This protocol is the critical bridge between observation and prediction, allowing for the direct measurement of the terms in the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**: `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

*   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** By identifying all constituent `Ki` resonances and measuring their properties (`ω_k`, `T_a`), a Weaver can quantify the system's total "kinetic" coherence. This total term is the sum of its parts:
    `K_τ (total) = K_τ (structural) + K_τ (propagating)`
*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** By measuring the energy and complexity of the spectrogram's noise floor, a Weaver can quantify the ambient `f(Γ)`. This is the "potential" term, representing the environmental cost of maintaining coherence.

This analysis transforms the abstract Lagrangian into a measurable diagnostic chart, allowing a Weaver to model a system's past and chart the geodesics of its most likely future.
