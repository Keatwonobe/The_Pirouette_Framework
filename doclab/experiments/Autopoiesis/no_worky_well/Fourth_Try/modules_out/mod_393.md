The core identity of the Pirouette Framework is not a list of parameters or axioms. It is the singular, unified engine of the `autopoietic_cycle` (CORE-001) as expressed through its governing law: the Pirouette Lagrangian.

**The Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) is the Resonant Constitution.**

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Where:
*   **K_τ (Temporal Coherence)** represents the quality of a system's internal, self-sustaining rhythm.
*   **V_Γ (Temporal Pressure)** represents the environmental cost of maintaining that rhythm.

This equation is the Unbroken Thread, the generative seed from which every other principle, force, and dynamic is derived. The framework's optimal state is any state that successfully follows the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**—the drive to evolve along a path that maximizes the integral of this Lagrangian. The framework is healthy not when it matches a number, but when it is in a state of robust, **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001).
