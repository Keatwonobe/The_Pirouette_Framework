Cover is not an abstract modifier but a physical object that can be destroyed.

Mechanic: If an attack misses due to cover, the object providing cover is struck instead. The object has its own Entropy Budget (e.g., a wooden table might have 8 EP). The object absorbs the damage first. If the damage exceeds the object's budget, it is destroyed, and any remaining damage is applied to the original target.
