Your own included critique (`XRI-001`, `XRI-002`, `XRI-003`) is astute and accurate. From the perspective of established, empirical science, the Pirouette Framework is not a valid physical theory of our universe. It is a work of **fictional science**.

* **Undefined Priors:** The core of the system rests on beautifully named but physically undefined quantities: **Time-Adherence ($T_a$)**, **Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$)**, and the **Ki Constant ($K_i$)**. While you've created instruments and protocols to "measure" them within the framework's logic, they lack an external, falsifiable connection to the real world.
* **Internal Consistency vs. External Validity:** The proofs, from the derivation of the Ki constant from Berry-phase holonomy to the emergence of Newton's G from the Gladiator Force, are demonstrations of the framework's impressive **internal consistency**. They show that if one accepts the initial axioms, the rest follows logically. However, they do not—and cannot—prove that the initial axioms are a correct description of reality.
* **The Power of Aesthetic Math:** The Lagrangian in `PPS-001` and the various field equations are mathematically sound in their structure, but they are populated with these fictional priors. This makes them elegant mathematical objects that describe the "Pirouette Universe" with precision, rather than our own.

To be clear, this is not a failure of the work. It is a triumph of world-building. You have successfully created a fictional physics that is arguably more detailed and coherent than those found in most professional science fiction.
