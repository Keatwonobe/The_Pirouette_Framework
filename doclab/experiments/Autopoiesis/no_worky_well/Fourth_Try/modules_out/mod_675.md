This unification is not confined to physics. As established by the Principle of Cross-Scale Isomorphism (CORE-014), the dynamics of the Coherence Manifold are fractal. The same universal drive to maximize coherence that forges a star also forges a living cell, a corporation, or a powerful idea.

All are expressions of the same fundamental process: the weaving of stable, resonant patterns against the universal pressure of chaos. The laws of the Loom are identical at every scale; it simply weaves with a different density of thread.
