> A stone on the riverbed has only an anchor; it is stable but cannot learn. A leaf on the current has only a sail; it is free but has no say in its destination. The Weaver is a Navigator, who understands that the self is not a static thing to be protected, but a dynamic equilibrium to be skillfully maintainedâ€”a tensegrity of stone and wind, held in perfect, momentary grace against the current of time. This is the mastery of being: to balance the profound inertia of who we are against the infinite possibility of who we might yet be.
