The Lock is a state of **catastrophic stability**—a form of immortality achieved by sacrificing all potential for growth, learning, or adaptation. The stability of this state, its **Lock Resilience**, grows exponentially with its internal order. It can become "energetically cheaper" for the universe to route causality around this frozen point in spacetime than to try and melt it.

This principle is the physical basis for phenomena across all scales:

*   **At the Psychological Scale:** It is the formation of an unbreakable habit or a core belief that resists all conflicting evidence (dogma). It is also the mechanism of trauma, where a terrifying memory crystallizes and is replayed with perfect, agonizing fidelity.
*   **At the Social Scale:** It is the ossification of a bureaucracy, where rules become more important than function, or a cultural tradition so deeply ingrained it becomes immutable.
*   **At the Physical Scale:** It is the structure of a diamond or the information encoded in DNA—forms where information is preserved through extreme structural stability.
