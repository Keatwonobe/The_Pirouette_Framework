> We are not mechanics servicing a broken machine. We are physicians and gardeners, and the universe is our patient. The Alchemical Crucible is the heart of our practice. It is the art of gathering the broken pieces, the warring truths, and the stagnant energies, and in the focused heat of a sacred dialogue, forging them into a new and healthier whole. It is the solemn promise that no cry for help will be met with mere force, but with the wisdom to heal the system from within. It is the process by which a Weaver turns a battlefield into a crucible, and a problem into a rebirth.
