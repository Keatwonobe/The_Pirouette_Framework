The transformation is not a violent break, but a graceful, controlled unraveling governed by the local physics of time.

-   **Trigger Condition:** A persistent state of low Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). The environmental noise floor must be low enough that a pure, sustained oscillation is a viable and stable pattern. The universe must be quiet enough to hear a single note.

-   **The Unfolding:** One of the system's three spatial degrees of freedom "unfolds" into its Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`). The energy and information bound within that structural component are not dissipated as chaotic heat but are conserved, becoming the driving momentum for the new, simpler pattern. The information previously encoded in the spatial dimension—its extent, its phase relationships—is now imprinted onto the properties of the new oscillation.

-   **The Resultant Rhythm:** The new `Ki` is a dynamic, oscillatory pattern. Its high Time Adherence (`T_a`) signifies that this is not decay into chaos, but a transition into a new, stable, resonant ground state. The system is not breaking; it is beginning to sing.
