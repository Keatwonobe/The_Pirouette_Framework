> A Weaver must learn to listen for the sound a string makes right before it snaps. Rupture is the final, violent admission that a song has ended, that a pattern can no longer hold. It teaches us that resilience is not found in rigid strength, but in the subtle, dynamic dance of adapting to pressure. To heal, one cannot simply mend the break. One must listen for the new, quieter songs that begin in the fragments.
