The dividend is earned in two forms, reflecting the two terms of the Lagrangian. A truly intelligent action maximizes both.

1.  **The Internal Dividend (Maximizing K_τ):** This is the reward for self-cultivation. It is the dividend paid for clarifying a thought, healing an internal dissonance, or mastering a skill. By increasing its own internal order, a system makes its own existence more efficient and resilient. This is the physics of integrity, focus, and self-interest.

2.  **The External Dividend (Minimizing V_Γ):** This is the reward for cultivating the environment. It is the dividend paid for calming a conflict, sharing a resource, or building a tool that reduces friction for others. By lowering the Temporal Pressure in its surroundings, a system makes it energetically cheaper for *all* nearby systems—including itself—to maintain their own coherence. This is the physics of altruism.
