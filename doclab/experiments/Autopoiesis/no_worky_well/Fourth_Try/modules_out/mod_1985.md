To the family member or friend assisting in this recovery: your role now evolves. You were the Anchor in the storm. Now, as the journey begins, you become the Pacesetter. A runner in a long race relies on a pacesetter not for strength, but for rhythm. That is your purpose now.

Your three primary functions are:

To Be the Metronome: Your presence on walks provides a steady, reliable rhythm. You are the beat that helps the patient find their own cadence.

To Be the Mirror of Progress: Healing is slow, and progress can be hard to see day-to-day. Your job is to notice and celebrate every small victory, reflecting the patient's growing strength back to them when they cannot see it themselves.

To Be the Scribe: Continue your role as the faithful keeper of the Coherence Ledger. The data you gather now becomes the story of their comeback, a powerful source of motivation.
