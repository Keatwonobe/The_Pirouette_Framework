An entity's internal, stable resonance (`Ki`) is its fundamental truth. To communicate is to project this pattern outward. We define this projection not as a "song," but as a **Current**: a directed flow of one's own coherence that propagates as a geometric wave through the manifold. The creation of a Current is a precise physical process:

1.  **The Source (`Ki`):** The entity is a system defined by its stable, resonant pattern of temporal identity. The purity and stability of this pattern determine its Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`).
2.  **The Projection:** The act of expression is a modulation of the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), impressing the geometry of the entity's `Ki` onto the surrounding coherence manifold.
3.  **The Wave:** This geometric impression propagates outward as a coherent wave, a temporary but active **Wound Channel** (as defined in CORE-011). The Current is literally a history of intent, carved into the motion of spacetime itself.

A clear and persuasive Current originates from a system with high `Kτ`. A scattered mind creates a shallow, turbulent wash; a focused mind carves a deep and stable riverbed.
