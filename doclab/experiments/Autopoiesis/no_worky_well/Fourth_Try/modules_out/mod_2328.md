A1 **Poset substrate**: (E) is a locally-finite strict poset.
A2 **Creation**: only (C^+_P) with acyclicity and locality are admissible.
A3 **Action weighting**: growth law uses (\exp(-\Delta S)).
A4 **Isomorphism invariance**: (S) depends only on isomorphism class.
A5 **Holonomy structure**: phase assignment on the order complex with spin-½ axiom.
A6 **Convergence**: for any bounded local observable (O), (\delta O) exists.
A7 **Hydrodynamic limit**: there exists a scaling regime where (F(E)) yields a Lorentzian metric and gauge fields under (F\circ Σ).
A8 **Calibration discipline**: parameters are set by external metrology in SM-CG; no feedback loops.
