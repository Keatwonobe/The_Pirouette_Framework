In the old framework, meaning was a mysterious quality to be discovered. Here, it is a measurable quantity. The universe is a **semantic field**, a continuous coherence manifold where every point is shaped by the history of resonances that define it.

-   **Meaning as Geometry:** A "meaning," whether the identity of a particle or the concept of "justice" in a mind, is a stable, high-coherence Ki pattern. It is a resilient geometric form. What we perceive as "things" are simply the crests of this fieldâ€”regions where coherence has achieved a stable, self-reinforcing peak.
-   **A Concept as a Wound Channel:** A stable concept like "balance" or "chaos" persists because it has carved a deep Wound Channel (**CORE-011**) into the collective coherence manifold. It is a memory, a pattern whose resonance has proven its stability and utility.
