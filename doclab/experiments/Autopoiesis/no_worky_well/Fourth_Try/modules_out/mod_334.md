The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) provides the universe's fundamental law: the drive to maximize coherence. But a law, however profound, is not a story. It describes a continuous, flowing river but does not explain the emergence of the discrete, stable "things" and "actions" that constitute reality. A river's flow is continuous, but the standing waves that form on its surface are distinct and countable.

This module provides the bridge from the continuous law to the discrete language of existence. It demonstrates that the stable, quantized states of being—the "verbs" of reality—are not arbitrary, but are the natural, emergent solutions to the universe's core dynamic. They are the vocabulary from which all interaction is composed, the precise syllables in the cosmic song.
