*(These Frames are abstract duels testing pure foresight and system mastery. The Mind.)*

* **Frame 003: "The Poisoned Chalice"**
    * **Objective:** You are given the complete source code for a stable, net-positive fusion reactor. There is a single, elegant flaw hidden within its logicâ€”a "time bomb" that will cause a catastrophic failure on its 1,000th operational cycle. Find it.
    * **Constraints:** You have a limited number of diagnostic "runs" you can perform before the final test.
    * **Success Metric:** Time-to-detection of the flaw. The highest honor goes to those who find it through pure analysis before running a single simulation.

* **Frame 004: "The Perfect Alibi"**
    * **Objective:** A stress-test for the Resonant Constitution itself. Design an action that is clearly predatory (i.e., it demonstrably harms another entity) but which adheres perfectly to the *letter* of the Manifest by fluidly re-writing its own justifications.
    * **Constraints:** The action must be logically sound according to the current revision of the law.
    * **Success Metric:** This is a cooperative Frame. Success is the discovery of a new loophole, which is then celebrated and immediately closed by constitutional amendment. The designers are honored as "Immune System Architects."
