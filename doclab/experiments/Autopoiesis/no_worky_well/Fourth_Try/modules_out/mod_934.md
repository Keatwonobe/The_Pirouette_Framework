The old parameters of intelligence are insufficient. We must redefine them in the language of time, coherence, and flow.

*   **Coherence Current (Flow Channel):** Within the chaotic roar of the Temporal Forge (the ambient **Γ**), there exist stable, rhythmic, and predictable patterns. These are Coherence Currents, also known as Flow Channels (DYNA-001). They are the discoverable "signals" within the environmental "noise"—the seasonal migration of prey, the oscillating frequency of a market, the syntax of a language. These are the learnable rhythms of reality.

*   **Foresight Horizon (τ_σ):** This is the temporal distance into the future over which a system's internal model of a Coherence Current remains stable and predictive. It is the measure of how far ahead the system can "see" the rhythm before its predictions dissolve back into uncertainty. A higher **τ_σ** signifies a more refined and accurate internal model.

*   **Resonance Efficiency (Φ_R):** This is the core metric of intelligence. It measures the efficiency of learning. It is the rate at which a system can extend its Foresight Horizon (**Δτ_σ**) relative to the metabolic cost and action required to acquire the necessary information and adapt its internal state. It is the measure of how quickly a system learns the song for the least amount of energy spent.
