summary: Defines the fundamental mechanics of influence, or 'Coherence Transfer,'
  between distinct systems. It reframes 'cross-domain bleed' as the process by which
  a system's resonant echo propagates across a shared medium, forming a bridge that
  imprints upon and alters the coherence manifold of a receiving system. This provides
  a time-first physical basis for communication, empathy, and memetics.
