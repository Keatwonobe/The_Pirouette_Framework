In the last phase, we found our current and learned to flow with it. The river is now steady. It is time to enter the forge.

This phase is not about pushing through pain; it is about inviting a challenge. Like a blacksmith who uses the hammer's blow not to shatter the steel but to strengthen it, we will now introduce small, controlled stresses to your system. Each challenge is an invitation for your body to become more resilient, more capable, and more alive. This guide, for you and your helper, is the blueprint for that forge. This is where we temper your new strength.
