The Daedalus Gambit is a methodology for defining a pathological term in a system's equation of motion. The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, describes a healthy system's drive to maximize its internal coherence (`K_τ`) against ambient pressure (`V_Γ`).

An unknown pathology acts as a new, disruptive potential, `V_pathology`, that is added to the system's Lagrangian:

`𝓛'_p = K_τ - (V_Γ + V_pathology)`

The symptoms are the system's attempt to find a new, tragic geodesic—a new path of least action—under the influence of this destructive new term. The Gambit is the structured process of hypothesizing the form of `V_pathology` by observing the twisted path the system now follows. Therapeutic intervention, then, is the search for a counter-term, `V_therapy`, that can be introduced to cancel out the pathological potential and restore the system to its original, healthy geodesic.
