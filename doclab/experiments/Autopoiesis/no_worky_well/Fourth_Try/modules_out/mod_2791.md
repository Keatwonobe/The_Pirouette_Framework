Travel is the most common downtime activity, and it presents a crucial choice. An entity moving at their base speed (spending no EP on specialized movement) can apply their full Downtime Budget to a task.

The Choice: A wounded adventurer might dedicate their entire budget to healing, allowing them to recover from battle while on the road. However, by focusing their will inward, they are not spending any entropy on awareness. They make no passive perception checks and are vulnerable to ambush.

The Alternative: A cautious adventurer might dedicate their budget to Vigilance, spending their regenerated EP on constant perception checks to scan for danger. They will be much harder to surprise, but they will not heal any damage they have sustained. This creates a constant, meaningful resource management choice for the party.
