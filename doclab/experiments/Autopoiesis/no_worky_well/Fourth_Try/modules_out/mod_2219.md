Let a system's dynamics be governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian L_p = K_tau - V(phi, Gamma). The act of measurement is an interaction that couples the observer's own state (psi_obs) to the system's state (phi). We model this coupling as a perturbation to the system's potential.

The observation operator O_kappa transforms the potential as follows:

V(phi, Gamma) -> V'(phi, Gamma) = V(phi, Gamma) + kappa * W(phi; psi_obs)

Where:

kappa is the measurement strength or coupling constant. A kappa of 0 means no observation is occurring.

W(phi; psi_obs) is the interaction potential, which describes how the observer's state influences the energy landscape of the observed system.

The "Observer's Shadow" is the geometric deformation of the coherence manifold caused by the addition of this new term to the potential.
