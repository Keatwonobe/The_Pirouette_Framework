1.  **Shadow Weight (V_obs):** Quantifies the intensity or "weight" of the gaze. It is the magnitude of the observer's potential field (`V_obs`) added to the system's Lagrangian. An intense, high-energy probe casts a "heavy" shadow, representing a significant intervention.

2.  **Coherence Cost (ΔKτ_sys):** Measures the harmonic interference and disruption caused by the observation. It is the net change in the system's internal coherence (`Kτ_sys`) resulting from the interaction. High cost signifies a dissonant or forceful measurement that destabilizes the system.

3.  **Information Transfer (Φ_Kτ):** Measures the net flow of coherence between the observer and the system, quantifying the fidelity of the Measurement Echo. A positive flow indicates the observer successfully imprinted its pattern onto the system (high `I_gain`). A negative flow indicates the system's resonance was so powerful it altered the observer's state (an act of "learning" by the observer, but potentially a failed measurement).

4.  **Echo Persistence (τ_echo):** Measures the decay time of the Measurement Echo's imprint on the system's manifold. It quantifies the duration of the observation's memory, indicating whether the interaction was a fleeting glance or a formative, lasting event.
