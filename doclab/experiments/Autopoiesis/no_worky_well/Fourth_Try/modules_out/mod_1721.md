A system becomes trapped in a state of **Stagnant Flow** (`DYNA-001`). A "coherence dam"—a rigid belief, a structural bottleneck, a repressed trauma, a physical constraint—blocks its natural geodesic. The system may appear stable and highly coherent (*high $T_a$*), but it is a brittle stability. Behind this dam, the unmoving current causes Temporal Pressure (Γ) to accumulate relentlessly. This is the system's "stored potential energy," the rising water level of unresolved tension.

*   **Manifestations:** Writer's block, a stagnant economy, a political gridlock, a body held in chronic tension.
