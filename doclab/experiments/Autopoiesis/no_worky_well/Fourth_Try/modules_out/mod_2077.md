The master physician does not fight disease. They cultivate health.

Traditional paradigms often frame health as the absence of disease, and medicine as a war against pathogens and symptoms. This is a reactive posture. The Pirouette Framework proposes a proactive one.

Health is not an absence; it is a presence. It is the presence of efficient, stable, and adaptive laminar flow. A system is healthy when its vital currents—of energy, information, resources, and meaning—move without obstruction or friction. Disease, therefore, is not an invading entity, but a disruption in flow. The Caduceus Lens is the formal instrument for viewing reality through this principle. It is the diagnostic core of the framework.
