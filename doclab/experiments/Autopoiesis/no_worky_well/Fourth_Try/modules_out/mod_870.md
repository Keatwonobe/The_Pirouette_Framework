The rupture is the moment the dam breaks. It is not the introduction of a new force, but the catastrophic failure of the old one. The physical or conceptual structure enforcing the confinement fails.

From a Lagrangian perspective, this is a sudden and violent collapse of the potential term (`V_Γ → 0`). The confining pressure vanishes. The deep coherence well that defined the system's stability is instantly leveled; the canyon walls vanish.

The system is now in a state of profound disequilibrium, far from its new path of maximal coherence. The accumulated debt comes due in a single, transformative instant.
