- EM potential: A_{μ} := ∂_{μ} arg(Ki) under Σ.
- Charge: q := orientation/asymmetry of coherence coupling in CORE-007 (crest- vs trough-leading).
- Gravitational well: gradients in Γ act as effective curvature (CORE-004/008).
- Spin-½: double-cover holonomy of the Ki motif (CORE-009).
This explains recovery of SM/QFT predictions without making spacetime fundamental.
