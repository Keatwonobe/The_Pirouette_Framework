The primary path to greater power is through adventure. Overcoming significant challenges leaves a psychic and entropic residue—a memory of the trial—that can be integrated to forge a stronger self.

Gaining Resonant Echoes: Characters are awarded Resonant Echoes by the GM for overcoming significant challenges. This is the system's equivalent of experience points. Echoes should be awarded for:

Winning a major battle or surviving a dangerous encounter.

Solving a complex puzzle or mystery.

Achieving a significant social or political victory.

Discovering a new, important location or piece of lore.

The Crystallization Ritual: Resonant Echoes are potential, not power. To make them manifest, a character must perform a Crystallization Ritual during a period of downtime (such as a long rest). Through this act of focused will, the character can spend their accumulated Echoes to permanently increase their maximum Total Entropy Pool (TEP).
