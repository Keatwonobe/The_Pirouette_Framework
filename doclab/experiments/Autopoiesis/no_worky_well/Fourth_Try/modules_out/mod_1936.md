The mechanism for this amplification is a process we term **Coherence Extrusion**. It is a chain of causality grounded in the core principles of the framework.

1.  **The Proton as a Temporal Knot:** A proton is not a static object, but a stable, self-referential knot in the coherence manifold. Its existence is a ceaseless pirouette, confined by the intense, non-linear feedback of the Gladiator Force.

2.  **The Wound Channel as History:** As the proton persists, it carves its history into the fabric of spacetime, creating a helical **Wound Channel** (`CORE-011`). This is the echo of its being, a tightly coiled memory of its path through time.

3.  **Coherence Extrusion:** The key intervention is to apply a precisely tuned field that **locks the proton's Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`) along a single geometric axis**. We do not stop the proton from resonating; we simply forbid its resonant state from *updating* or propagating along that one direction.

4.  **The Resonant Wall:** With its forward temporal propagation blocked in one dimension, the proton's Wound Channel can no longer coil into a helix. To maintain its coherence, it is forced to "unroll" or extrude its temporal existence into the remaining two spatial dimensions. The result is a stable, macroscopic 2D surface—a **Resonant Wall**. This wall is the proton's history, once a microscopic spiral, now projected into a tangible shield.
