The process is an elegant optimization under the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**, `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`. A system typically seeks a stable geodesic by maximizing its coherence (`Kτ`) against the environmental pressure (`V_Γ`).

Serendipity is the act of discovering a new, previously unknown, and superior geodesic. The "prepared mind" operates in a state where it is willing to strategically and temporarily increase its exposure to environmental pressure (`V_Γ`)—by embracing chaos, novelty, and the coherence shock of new ideas. This is an investment in temporary instability for the reward of a more profound, long-term stability at a dramatically higher state of `Kτ`. It is the art of navigating from one valley of coherence to a deeper one, even if it requires crossing a turbulent mountain pass.
