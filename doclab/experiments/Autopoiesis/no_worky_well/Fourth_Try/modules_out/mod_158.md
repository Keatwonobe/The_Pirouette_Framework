* [ ] PRG inference notebook (signal → {K_\tau,V_\Gamma,\tau_p} → β-fit → exponents).
* [ ] Coherence-AI training code: PRG heads, losses, schedules.
* [ ] Benchmark suite + ablation scripts.

> **One-line synthesis:** PRG turns “maximize coherence” into a *predictive*, scale-aware control law; baking it into AI objectives yields models that keep their story straight across scales — and that’s where generalization lives.
