This model provides a clean, actionable set of KPIs for auditing the health of any system.

| KPI                  | Formula / Concept                 | Replaces              | Diagnostic Question                                                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lagrangian Health**  | `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`                  | `Free Coherence`      | What is the system's net vitality? Is it growing, stable, or decaying?           |
| **Coherence Flux**     | `d𝓛_p/dt`                         | `Flux Ratio`          | Is the system's overall health improving or worsening? What is its trajectory?     |
| **Coherence Ratio**    | `η_c = Kτ / (Kτ + V_Γ)`           | `Entropy Efficiency`  | How efficient is the system at being itself? How much of its state is signal vs. noise? |
| **Environmental Load**   | `V_Γ`                             | `Info-entropy`        | What is the absolute environmental stress the system is currently enduring?      |
| **Pressure Gradient**  | `d(V_Γ)/dt`                       | `Drift Index`         | Is the environment becoming more hostile? (An early warning of imminent crisis). |
| **Adaptive Resilience**  | `1 / |Δt_recovery|` after a Γ spike | N/A                   | How quickly does the system return to homeostasis after an external shock?       |
