The Sentinel Protocol is founded on the following principles:

1.  **The Principle of Anticipatory Accountability:** An entity is accountable not only for the measurable residue of its past actions but also for maintaining a state of coherent foresight to prevent foreseeable harm. Responsibility is a function of both performance and potential.
2.  **The Principle of Dynamic Coherence:** A system's boundary is not a static property but a dynamic process. It is the emergent manifold that reflects the system's ongoing, resonant interactions with its environment.
3.  **The Principle of Consequentialism:** The ultimate, non-negotiable scope of a system's accountability for any given action is the full spatio-temporal manifold that contains the action's **Wound Channel**â€”the measurable perturbation of the environment until it returns to baseline.
