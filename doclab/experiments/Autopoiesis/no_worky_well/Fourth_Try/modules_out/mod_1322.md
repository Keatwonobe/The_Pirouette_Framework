The resilience of any system is described by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`), which balances internal stability against external pressure:

`𝓛_p = K_τ (Temporal Coherence) - V_Γ (Temporal Pressure)`

A healthy system maintains a positive Lagrangian (`𝓛_p > 0`), where its capacity for coherent resonance exceeds the environmental cost. Rupture is governed by the failure of this balance.

The **Condition for Rupture** is not a static threshold but a dynamic decline. A system enters a state of critical risk when its coherence begins to actively degrade, a condition marked by a negative time-derivative of the Lagrangian:

`∂𝓛_p / ∂t < 0`

The rupture event itself is the phase transition that occurs when the Lagrangian crosses zero (`𝓛_p ≤ 0`). At this point, the system has lost the "energetic profit" of its own existence; its form creates more stress than it resolves, and a collapse into a simpler, less coherent state becomes the path of least resistance.
