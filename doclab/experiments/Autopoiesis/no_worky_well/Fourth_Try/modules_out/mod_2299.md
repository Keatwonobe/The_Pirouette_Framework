* The one-loop Schwinger term (C_1=+\tfrac12) is positive; the dominant two-loop pieces preserve the sign once Ward identities and counterterms are enforced.
* Apparent sign flips typically trace to: (i) opposite metric signature conventions without compensating changes, (ii) missing counterterm in the on-shell scheme, or (iii) absorbing (\pi) factors into (C_2) incorrectly.
* Therefore, the QED-normalized **universal** (C_2) used in MATH-014v2 must be **positive**.
