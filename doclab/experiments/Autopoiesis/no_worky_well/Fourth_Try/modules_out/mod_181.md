V1 ΛCDM limit: m_Γ/H→∞, V_tail→0 ⇒ spectra match CDM to ≤0.1%.
V2 DE‑limit: tune V_tail so that today w_Γ≈−1 with Ω_Γ≈0.7; reproduce TT/TE/EE within Planck contours when Ω_b, n_s, A_s fixed.
V3 Growth: compute fσ_8(z) and ensure consistency with COSMO‑Γ‑000 outputs.
V4 Lensing: C_ℓ^{ϕϕ} within current uncertainties.
V5 Robustness: switch threshold variation by ×2 changes spectra < 0.2%.

Artifacts:
• cmb_spectra.json: {ell, ClTT, ClTE, ClEE, ClPP}
• growth_from_CLASS.json: {z, fσ8}
• logs/flags: solver switches, averaging usage, step rejections.
