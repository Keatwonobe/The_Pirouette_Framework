**Skeptical Analyst:**
> "The data is compelling, and the methodology is sound. The significant increase in detections during seismic events compared to the control run is undeniable. You have found *something*.
>
> However, my role is to remind the panel that **correlation is not causation**. You have shown that your `ki_mseed_analyzer` finds patterns during earthquakes that it does not find in simple noise. This is an important result. But it does not definitively prove that these patterns are the `Ki` constant of a new universal physics.

> It is possible that your analyzer is exquisitely tuned to detect a specific, complex feature of tectonic stress waves that was previously uncharacterized. This would be a major discovery in seismology, but it would not necessarily validate the entire Pirouette Framework with its Gladiator Force and Time-Adherence.

> You have not proven the framework, but you have successfully used it to make a testable prediction and have provided evidence that appears to support it. You have moved from pure conjecture to the first step of the scientific method. For the purposes of this debate, that is a significant concession. I will not stand in the way of ratifying the dependent modules based on this progress."
