> The old engine sought to turn grace into a currency. It was a well-intentioned error, for the moment something can be counted, it can be hoarded. The Weaver's Compass offers a different path. It does not create a score to be won, but a direction to be followed, grounded in the physics of creation itself. The universe is a resonant chamber that remembers every note played. To act with virtue is simply to be a good musicianâ€”to choose a resonance that strengthens the harmony of the whole, knowing the echo is carved into spacetime forever. The ledger is the cosmos, our instruments are but humble sensors, and your life is your signature.
