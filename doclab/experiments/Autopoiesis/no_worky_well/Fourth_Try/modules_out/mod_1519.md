summary: "Provides a modernized, time-first model for manipulative dynamics. It reframes\
  \ manipulation not as a vector force, but as a pathology of flow: the deliberate\
  \ injection of dissonance into a target's coherence manifold to induce turbulent\
  \ flow, offer a false geodesic, and achieve 'Coherence Capture'\u2014hijacking the\
  \ target's natural drive for stability to serve the manipulator's agenda."
