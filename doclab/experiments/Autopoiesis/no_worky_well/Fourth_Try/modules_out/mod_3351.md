* **Population Identified:** Over 200 proteins with fractal-dimension z-scores matching Ki constants within a narrow tolerance.
* **Functional Enrichment:**

  * **Molecular Motors** (e.g., Dynein Heavy Chain): The cell's "movers and shapers."
  * **Master Regulators** (e.g., ATM Kinase, key transcription factors): The cell's "decision‑makers."
  * **Environmental Sentinels** (e.g., TRP Channels): The cell's "gatekeepers."
* **Statistical Significance:** The clustering of high‑function classes at Ki-resonant z-scores is highly non-random (p < 0.001).
