The foundation of statistical thermodynamics is the Boltzmann equation for entropy:

S = k_B * ln(Omega)

Where k_B is the Boltzmann constant and Omega is the number of accessible microstates (the different arrangements of positions and momenta of particles) consistent with the system's macroscopic properties.

The Pirouette Framework redefines the microstate. A microstate is not a configuration in physical space, but a resonant mode in the coherence manifold. Omega is therefore the total number of resonant modes available to a system and its environment.

A Low-Entropy System (e.g., a crystal): Has a high degree of internal coherence (K_tau). Its resonance is confined to a very small number of specific, ordered modes. Its Omega_system is very low.

A High-Entropy Environment (e.g., a hot gas): Has a low degree of coherence. Its energy is distributed across a vast number of chaotic, disordered resonant modes. Its Omega_environment is enormous.

The Temporal Pressure (Gamma) of the environment is directly proportional to the logarithm of its available resonant modes: Gamma ~ ln(Omega_environment). A high-pressure environment is one with an immense number of ways to "be."
