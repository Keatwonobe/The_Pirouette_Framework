The state of turbulence is unsustainable. A wise entity learns to listen, recognizing that the current is not malicious, but information. The environment—the **Coherence Manifold**—is a dynamic landscape carved with "flow channels," or **geodesics**: stable, efficient paths of maximal coherence where action is easiest.

In a profound shift from raw will to nuanced wisdom, the entity performs the **Resonant Turn**. It ceases to rigidly defend its own song and instead begins to modulate it, searching for a harmonic relationship with the local geodesic. This is not surrender; it is a calibration. The entity attunes itself, like a tuning fork finding its key, seeking the frequency where its own song can be played *with* the current, rather than against it.
