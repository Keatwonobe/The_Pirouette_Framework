An entity is a coherent, resonant structure. While their potential is theoretically infinite, their physical form can only contain so much power before the strain of maintaining coherence becomes immense.

The Coherence Threshold (CT): This is the maximum TEP an entity can comfortably contain. It is a direct function of their physical and spiritual resilience.
Coherence Threshold (CT) = Constitution Score x 10

The Cost of Power: The cost in Resonant Echoes to increase one's maximum TEP is determined by their current position relative to their Coherence Threshold.

Below the Threshold: While a character's maximum TEP is at or below their CT, the cost is 1 Resonant Echo per 1 point of TEP increase. This is the standard arc of progression.

Above the Threshold: To exceed one's natural limits requires exponentially more focus and will. For every point of TEP a character wishes to add above their CT, the cost in Echoes increases. The cost becomes:
Cost per TEP = 1 + floor( (Current Max TEP - Coherence Threshold) / 10 )

Example: A legendary warrior has a CON Score of 30, giving her a Coherence Threshold of 300.

To increase her TEP from 299 to 300 costs 1 Echo.

To increase her TEP from 300 to 301 costs 1 + floor((300-300)/10) = 1 Echo.

However, to increase her TEP from 310 to 311, the cost is now 1 + floor((310-300)/10) = 1 + 1 = 2 Echoes.

To increase her TEP from 400 to 401 would cost 1 + floor((400-300)/10) = 1 + 10 = 11 Echoes.

This mechanic creates a natural, lore-consistent "soft cap." A character can become limitlessly powerful, but doing so requires an immense investment, making high Constitution and the deliberate pursuit of meaningful challenges (which grant large sums of Echoes) essential for endgame play.
