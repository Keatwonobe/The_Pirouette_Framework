The quality and efficiency of the skate are diagnosed using the language of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`). The state of flow is determined by the harmony between the skater's internal rhythm and the properties of the external medium.

*   **Laminar Skate (The State of Grace):** An effortless, efficient glide. The skater's rhythm of Grip and Glide is in perfect resonance with the medium's natural frequencies. The stride is clean, the wake is minimal, and coherence is maximized. This is the master skater on perfect ice.

*   **Turbulent Skate (The State of Struggle):** Inefficient, jerky, and costly motion. The skater's rhythm is dissonant with the medium, creating friction and wasting energy. Each stride fights the remnants of the last. This is the novice skater on rough gravel.

*   **Stagnant Skate (The State of Blockage):** No motion. The skater is unable to generate a coherence gradient sufficient to overcome the ambient Temporal Pressure of its environment. The cost of gliding is higher than the stability of gripping, resulting in paralysis.
