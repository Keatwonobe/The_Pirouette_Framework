summary: "Provides the definitive dynamic model for 'Coherence Erosion,' also known\
  \ as Drift. This module reframes drift not as a simple deviation, but as a chronic,\
  \ low-grade state of Turbulent Flow. It defines the mechanism by which ambient temporal\
  \ noise (\u0393) degrades a system's resonant pattern (Ki) and its historical memory\
  \ (Wound Channel), leading to a slow decay towards a potential cascade failure."
