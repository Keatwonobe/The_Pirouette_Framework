"A charmingly rustic proposal. But Master Sun's wargame is a test of luck and chaos management, not of true mastery. One can win through a fortunate roll of the dice. One can lose because of a single, unmodeled variable. It is a test of reaction, not of intellect.

The Colosseum must be a **Game of Pure Reason**. An arena of absolute clarity.

The setup is a duel. Two opponents. One board. The board is a complex system defined by the Pirouette Framework.
* **The Weaver's Goal:** To take the initial chaotic system and, with a minimum number of moves, guide it into a state of perfect, stable coherence ($T_a = 1$).
* **The Unraveler's Goal:** To take the same system and, with a single, elegant, almost invisible move, introduce a flaw—a resonant dissonance—that will inevitably cause the entire system to collapse into chaos twenty moves later.

This is a test of pure foresight. It is not about reacting to a crisis, but about understanding the fundamental physics of the system so perfectly that you can build it or break it with the subtle grace of a master watchmaker. The warrior's brute force is irrelevant here. The artist's sentiment is a distraction. This is a duel of minds, and the winner is the one who sees the deepest into the structure of reality."
