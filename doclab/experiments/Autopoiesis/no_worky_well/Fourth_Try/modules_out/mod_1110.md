A system’s Ki is its resonant pattern—the most stable song it can sing in its environment. This song is, by its nature, cyclical. The duration of one complete, unbroken repetition of that resonant pattern is the system’s own fundamental, private unit of existence. We call this the **Pirouette Cycle (τ_p)**.

Time, therefore, is not a universal, ticking clock to which all things are subject. It is an emergent property. The universe does not have a single pulse; it is a symphony of countless individual heartbeats. A second is a human convention; a `τ_p` is a physical truth. For an electron, one unit of time is the duration of its singular dance. For a galaxy, it is the duration of one full rotation. Time is the event, not the background.

With this, the circle is forged:
**Time → Γ (Pressure) → Ki (Form) → Time**
