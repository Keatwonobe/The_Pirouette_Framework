The old framework modeled yield with a complex suite of bespoke equations, treating it as a distinct physical property. This was a category error. Yield is not a property; it is a universal dynamic—a story that unfolds whenever a system's form is tested by the pressure of its environment. It is the study of how things choose.

This module reframes strain not as a passive deformation, but as an active, energetic struggle by a system to maintain its resonant identity against the rising pressure of its environment. Stress is redefined as rising Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), and a system's ability to resist is its internal Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`). The "breaking point" is the critical moment of decision when a system can no longer afford the energetic cost of maintaining its identity, forcing it to either adapt, transform, or shatter. This is a direct, observable consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence.
