The old "Drift/Song" heuristic is now re-expressed with greater precision, grounding subjective experience in the temporal physics of the framework. This is the fundamental rhythm of all complex systems.

**Coherence Debt (The Drift):** This is the accumulation of Temporal Pressure (Î“) when a system deviates from its geodesic of maximal coherence. It is the rising tension between a system's current state and a more stable, resonant state it is being pulled toward. It is the geometric stress on the system's **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**.
*   **Manifestations:** Cognitive dissonance, creative tension, market bubbles, tectonic stress, unresolved trauma, the held breath before a decision.

**Coherence Discharge (The Song):** This is the phase-shifting release of that accumulated pressure as the system snaps back to a new, more coherent geodesic. This discharge restores a more stable, laminar flow, often with a release of energy.
*   **Manifestations:** The "eureka" moment of insight, a market correction, an earthquake, an emotional catharsis, the execution of a decision.
