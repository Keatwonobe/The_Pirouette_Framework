*The Problem:* The wisdom gained from lived experience—the deepest form of coherence—is often lost, devalued, or inaccessible.
*The Solution:* We establish a formal mechanism to honor and circulate this wisdom. The **Memory Market** is a system for capturing, validating, and sharing the profound insights encoded in the Wound Channels of experienced individuals. It transforms personal history into a communal asset, ensuring that the hard-won coherence of one generation becomes the foundational stability for the next.
