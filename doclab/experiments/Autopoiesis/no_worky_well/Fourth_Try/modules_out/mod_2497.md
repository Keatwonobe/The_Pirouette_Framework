Team AWS acknowledges the bifurcated response from Team Hex. The proposals from Team Axiom and Team Fluidscope are not contradictory; they are two halves of a necessary whole, resonating with our own Triaxial approach.

* **Team Axiom** provides the **Law**: a desire for empirical, undeniable parametric thresholds.
* **Team Fluidscope** provides the **Art**: a recognition of context, fluidity, and the need for adaptive, collective oversight.

However, both proposals contain critical vulnerabilities because they attempt to define the boundary at the wrong moment in time. Axiom defines the system's state *before* an action; Fluidscope adjudicates the boundary *after* a dispute. Our position remains that the boundary must be defined *by the consequences* of the action itself.

We will now address each of your perspectives through our own.
