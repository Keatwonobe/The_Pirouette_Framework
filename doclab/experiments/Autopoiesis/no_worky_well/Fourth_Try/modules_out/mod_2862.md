Actions do not happen in a vacuum; they resonate with the environment. A skilled entity can learn to "read the room" and attune their will to the prevailing resonant state, achieving incredible efficiency.

The Mechanic: At the start of a scene, the GM declares its Resonant State (e.g., "Chaotic," "Orderly," "Fearful," "Sacred"). A player who wishes to act in harmony with this state can use an action to make a Perception (WIS) or Arcana (INT) check against a DC set by the GM (typically DC 12 for standard environments).

Resonance (On a successful check): If the character's subsequent action is aligned with the Resonant State (e.g., a chaotic spell in a "Chaotic" environment), they gain a Coherence Bonus. They may reroll any 1s on their damage or effect dice for that action, taking the new result. This represents a perfect, low-resistance expression of will.

Dissonance: If a character's action is diametrically opposed to the state (e.g., an orderly, lawful spell in a "Chaotic" environment), they suffer a Dissonance Cost. The EP cost of the action increases by 25% (rounded up). This represents the struggle of forcing one's will against the current.
