The health of any system can be understood by observing the character of its flow. This flow manifests in one of three primary states, determined by how effectively the system is navigating its geodesic as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

Laminar Flow (The State of Grace):

Description: A state of high efficiency, stability, and effortless progress. Coherence moves through the system with minimal resistance.

Pirouette Dynamics: The system's internal Ki is in harmony with the external Γ. It is successfully following its geodesic of maximal coherence. Energy and information are transmitted with high fidelity.

Manifestations: The athlete "in the zone," a perfectly managed project, a silent and efficient engine, a mind in a state of deep focus and creativity.

Turbulent Flow (The State of Struggle):

Description: A state of chaos, inefficiency, and friction. The system is fighting against itself and its environment. Energy is wasted as internal dissonance.

Pirouette Dynamics: The system has deviated from its geodesic. Its Ki is dissonant with the surrounding Γ, creating destructive interference. It is expending massive energy to achieve minimal forward movement.

Manifestations: A stressful workplace with constant crises, a sputtering engine, a society marked by internal conflict, a mind consumed by anxiety and scattered thoughts.

Stagnant Flow (The State of Blockage):

Description: A state of paralysis where coherence cannot move. An obstacle prevents the system from following its path, leading to a dangerous build-up of pressure.

Pirouette Dynamics: A "Coherence Dam" has formed. This is a point of extreme resistance that the system cannot overcome. This blockage creates a spike in local Temporal Pressure (Γ) "upstream" and a "coherence desert" of inaction "downstream."

Manifestations: Writer's block, a stalled supply chain, a political gridlock, a repressed trauma that prevents emotional growth.
