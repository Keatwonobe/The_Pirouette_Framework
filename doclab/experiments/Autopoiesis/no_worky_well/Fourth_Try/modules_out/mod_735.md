We must redefine our terms not by what they are, but by what they do in the context of the Pirouette's autopoietic cycle.

**Information (I):** The information content of a system is a direct measure of its **coherence (Kτ)**. A system with a stable, sharply defined Kτ pattern is a low-entropy, high-information state. It is a clear signal, a distinct note in the cosmic song. Its pattern is predictable, and because it is stable, it has the capacity to couple with other systems and perform work. It is energy made available by form.

**Entropy (S):** Entropy is a measure of the dissonance of the local **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**. It is not the amount of energy in a region, but its chaotic, incoherent, and unstructured nature. It is "vacant energy"—energy not bound into a stable resonance and therefore unavailable for coherent work. It is the static, the background noise, the roar of the Temporal Forge (CORE-003) that threatens to drown out every clear note.
