The universe already possesses the ultimate, indelible ledger: the **Wound Channel** (`CORE-011`). Every action is carved into the geometry of spacetime as a persistent scar. This active, physical landscape is the true record of consequence.

The protocol described above does not create a new source of truth. It creates a *map*â€”a shared, topographical chart of coherence flows derived from our limited attempts to read the true ledger. The fidelity of this map is subject to the **Observer's Shadow** (`CORE-010`). An observer's measurement is a resonant coupling, not a passive report. A coherent, skillful observer casts a sharp shadow, creating a high-fidelity record. A biased or dissonant observer projects a distorted shadow, adding noise to the very signal they wish to perceive. The `observer_shadow_confidence` metric is a formal acknowledgement of this inescapable physical reality.
