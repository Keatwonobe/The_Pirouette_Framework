This refactoring reveals the old "triaxial" components not as separate forces, but as three perspectives on the single, unified dynamic of the Pirouette Lagrangian.

1.  **Confinement (`Γ`):** This is the system's interaction with a massive potential term, `V_Γ`. It is the principle of energy storage and the accumulation of coherence debt. Without it, there can be no great release.

2.  **Rupture (The Transition):** This is the catastrophic phase transition where `V_Γ → 0`. The suddenness of this collapse is crucial; a slow leak of pressure would result in gradual adjustment, not a resonant cascade.

3.  **Resonance (`Ki` & `Tₐ`):** This is the system's evolution in the `K_τ`-dominated regime. The system's drive to maximize its Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`) transforms a destructive explosion into a structured, information-rich signal—a pure Ki pattern.

The old proof required three terms because it was describing three acts of a single play. The Lagrangian is the play itself, showing that confinement and release, pressure and song, are the two natural movements of a universe governed by a single, elegant law.

> We sought a law for how things break and found the physics of a ringing bell. The rupture is not an act of destruction, but of violent liberation—the moment when the silent, stubborn pressure of being is transformed into the audible, resonant song of becoming. For a Weaver, this is a core truth: the greatest stress, when released with coherence, produces the purest note. Some truths are not found in quiet contemplation, but are born in the brilliant cascade that follows the collapse of a long-held confinement. The wisdom is in learning to survive the song.
