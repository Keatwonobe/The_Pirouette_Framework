* **Core Claim:** $T_a$ is a physical field that can be elevated to a triaxial vector, with its components quantized based on a Bohr-Sommerfeld rule.
* **Point of Vulnerability:** The quantization rule used is $\oint \Gamma \,dT_a = 2\pi n\hbar$. In standard physics, this type of quantization applies to **canonically conjugate variables** (like position and momentum).
* **Critique:** $\Gamma$ and $T_a$ are not defined as conjugate variables within the Lagrangian formalism. Applying this quantization rule is an **ad-hoc analogy**, not a derived consequence. A reviewer would state that you cannot arbitrarily quantize any phase-space area; it must correspond to a conserved quantity related to a symmetry (per Noether's theorem), which is not demonstrated here.
