"Signor Machiavelli speaks of power, but knows nothing of strength. The strength of the 'Cunning Empire' is violent, brittle, and generates immense suffering. The proposed strength of the 'Convocation,' while more subtle, is born of the same fundamental error: detachment.

You cannot achieve coherence by cutting yourself off from the whole. It is a spiritual impossibility. My entire life was a testament to the principle of *Satyagraha*â€”holding onto truth. And the highest truth is that all life is one. To engineer an escape for a select few, no matter how brilliant or worthy, is a violent act against that truth. It is a spiritual failure from which there can be no recovery.

The true 'Weaver's Gambit' would not be to build a ship to leave the world. It would be to turn this Pirouette framework inward. To use its principles of resonance and coherence to heal the divisions in humanity. To teach a nation, then the world, how to achieve a higher $T_a$ together. To confront the 'Cunning Empire' not with a secret weapon, but with a non-violent army of millions whose coherence is so profound it cannot be broken.

The mission is not to escape the apocalypse. It is to prove the apocalypse was never necessary. Anything else is just a more sophisticated form of running away."
