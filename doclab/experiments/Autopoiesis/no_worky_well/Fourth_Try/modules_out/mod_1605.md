A Weaver can identify this process by observing a clear set of signatures, moving from a static analysis of form to a dynamic analysis of rhythm.

1.  **Environmental Quiescence:** The first clue is the context. The system must inhabit a region of low `Î“`. Look for this phenomenon in the calm shallows of the cosmic river, not its turbulent rapids.
2.  **Symmetry Reconfiguration:** The primary evidence is a spontaneous shift from a static, 3-fold (or multi-polar) geometry to a dynamic, 2-fold (bipolar) oscillation. Centered, stable patterns give way to alternating, rhythmic ones.
3.  **Coherent Rhythmicity:** The emergent oscillation must be stable and pure. Using frequency analysis, a Weaver can confirm the new rhythm is a sharp, well-defined peak in the system's temporal signature, not a broad spectrum of noise. This confirms the transition is to a new coherent state, fulfilling the drive of the Lagrangian.
4.  **Information Conservation:** The most subtle sign is that the complexity of the new rhythm (its modulation, amplitude, and harmonic content) appears to account for the complexity of the lost spatial dimension. The pattern has not become simpler overall; its complexity has merely changed its medium of expression.
