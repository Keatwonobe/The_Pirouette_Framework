The power of a weapon comes not from its type, but from its quality and how it is wielded. All weapons deal damage based on the wielder's invested Entropy; the weapon itself simply provides an edge of efficiency.

Weapon Quality: The damage a weapon adds to a strike is determined by its craftsmanship.

Poor (1d2): A rusty shiv, a poorly-made club.

Fair (1d4): A standard bandit's blade or scavenger's axe.

Good (1d6): A well-crafted weapon from a city smith.

Excellent (1d8): A masterwork piece.

Perfect (1d12): The pinnacle of mundane craftsmanship.

Enchanted (1d13+): See ยง2.

Wielding Style:

Two-Handed: When you attack with a weapon in two hands, you make a single attack roll, combining the Entropy of two swings into one devastating blow.

One-Handed / Dual-Wield: When attacking with one-handed weapons, you make two separate, faster strikes. You can target the same creature twice or two different creatures.

Reach: A weapon with the "Reach" property (spear, halberd) can be used to make melee attacks against targets up to 10 feet away without any additional EP cost for range.
