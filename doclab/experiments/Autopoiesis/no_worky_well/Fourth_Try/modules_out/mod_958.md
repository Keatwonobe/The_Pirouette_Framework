summary: Modernizes the 'Primal Engine' by reframing embodied learning as a physical
  process of discovering a path of maximal coherence (a geodesic) through a dynamic
  environment. It defines survival not as a programmed goal, but as the emergent property
  of an agent successfully maximizing the Pirouette Lagrangian over time, forging
  a stable platform upon which intelligence can be built.
