The most efficient way to find a flaw is not to search for the flaw itself, but to search for the absence of perfection. Instead of searching for a specific "fault" signature within a noisy system, we define the signature of health and measure everything that is *not that*. This is the principle of diagnosis by exception, or the Null Template.

**Theoretical Insight**: A healthy system, as defined by the Pirouette Framework, will evolve along the geodesic that maximizes the action integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p). This is a state of **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001). Any deviation from this path represents a loss of coherence, forcing the system into inefficient states of **Turbulent** or **Stagnant Flow**.

The process is a three-step dance:
1.  **Forge the Geodesic Blueprint:** Define the system's expected, ideal state. This is the path (`𝓛_p(expected)`) it *should* be taking if it were perfectly healthy and aligned.
2.  **Observe the Actual Flow:** Measure the system's real-time, actual state (`𝓛_p(actual)`).
3.  **Calculate the Gradient:** The difference between the two, the **Deviation Field (Δ𝓛)**, is a direct, quantitative measure of the system's "pain" or inefficiency. This field is the primary output of the Auditor; its peaks and troughs form a **Coherence Audit Map** of systemic stress.

A fault is no longer a binary "broken/not-broken" state. It is a continuous measure of coherence lost.
