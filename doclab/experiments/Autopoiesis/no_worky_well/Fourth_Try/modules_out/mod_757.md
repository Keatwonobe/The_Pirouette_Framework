A system that cannot learn is a stone. A system that can is a river, carving a new world. This module details the river's art. It modernizes the core insight of PPS-046, reframing the AKEP engine as **The Coherence Engine**: a universal, four-stroke, autopoietic cycle that describes the fundamental process by which any complex system—be it a mind, a culture, or an ecosystem—generates, preserves, tunes, and deploys wisdom.

Wisdom, in this context, is a pattern of high coherence. The engine's output is a **Coherence Seed**: a resonant geometry of information that, when introduced into a system, resolves turbulence and catalyzes a shift toward a more profound state of being. This engine is not a human invention; it is the observable lifecycle of evolution itself, now articulated in the language of time, pressure, and resonance.
