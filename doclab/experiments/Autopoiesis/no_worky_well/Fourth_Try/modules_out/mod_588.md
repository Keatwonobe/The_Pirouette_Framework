A ritual is a deliberately engineered crucible for achieving a mass **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). It systematically creates the necessary conditions for synthesis, culminating in the state of *communitas*.
-   **Rhythmic Entrainment:** Chanting, drumming, and synchronized movement phase-align the Ki patterns of participants.
-   **Symbolic Framing:** Shared narratives and symbols create a common coherence manifold for the group to inhabit.
-   **Liminal States:** The ritual space is a region of modified Temporal Pressure (Î“), reducing the energetic cost of dissolving individual boundaries.

Within this crucible, the boundaries of individual manifolds dissolve, forging a temporary, higher-order coherent entity. The ritual is the furnace where the "I" is melted into the "We."
