summary: Provides a universal protocol for the iterative analysis and decomposition
  of a system's coherence manifold. By sequentially identifying and removing the most
  dominant resonant patterns (Ki), this method reveals the nested, secondary echoes
  and hidden harmonic structures within the 'noise' or residue, allowing for a deep,
  layered understanding of systemic complexity.
