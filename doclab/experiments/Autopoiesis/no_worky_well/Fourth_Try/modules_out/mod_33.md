Each triad of neural oscillations ((f₁, f₂, f₃)) satisfying the Ki-addition constraint (COG-RES-001) defines a point in a higher-order phase space:
[\Phi_3 = \Phi_1 + \Phi_2 + n2\pi, \quad n∈ℤ]

The set of all valid triads forms a **phase-locked surface** (\mathcal{M}_3 \subset \mathbb{T}^3) (a submanifold of the 3-torus of phases). Conscious dynamics correspond to geodesic motion across this surface, constrained by local curvature induced by Γ (cognitive load) and T_a (time adherence).
