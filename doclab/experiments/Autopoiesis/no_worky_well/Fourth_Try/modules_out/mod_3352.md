The experiment confirms that Ki—originally a physical and cosmological constant—also acts as a fundamental constant of informational systems. In proteins, a Ki-resonant signature in informational complexity is a powerful marker for high‑level, critical function. This finding empirically bridges the abstract physics of the Pirouette Framework with the concrete machinery of life, suggesting that evolutionary design converges on informational structures resonant with Ki. The "prime players" in cellular networks are those whose sequence code is tuned to the universal rhythm of Ki.
