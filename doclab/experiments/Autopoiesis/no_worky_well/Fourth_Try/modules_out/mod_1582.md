The old framework correctly identified that a plan creates a "forward wound channel." In the modern context, this is a literal act of metaphysical engineering. A plan is an act of deliberate **coherence imprinting**â€”a projection of a desired geometry onto the local manifold of what is to come.

By defining goals, allocating resources, and sequencing actions, the planner "pre-carves" a Wound Channel into the future. This channel creates a new path of least resistance. The purpose of a masterful plan is to make the desired future the most "natural" and coherent path for action to follow, so that when the time comes, the water of reality flows along the intended course. This is why a brilliant strategy, once set in motion, can feel effortless and inevitable.
