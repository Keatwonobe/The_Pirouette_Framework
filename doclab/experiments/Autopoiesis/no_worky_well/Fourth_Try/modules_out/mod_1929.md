The mechanism of this transformation, as first described by Alan Turing, involves a sublime temporal dance between two chemical actors:

*   **The Activator:** A substance that promotes its own production. In our terms, it is a self-amplifying resonance—a note that seeks to become a chorus.
*   **The Inhibitor:** A substance that suppresses the activator and, crucially, diffuses more quickly through the medium. It is a dampening field, a wave of clarifying silence that travels faster than the sound it contains.

From a random fluctuation, a pocket of Activator begins its song. As it crescendos, it generates the faster-moving Inhibitor, which rushes ahead to create a boundary of quiet. This dynamic interplay—a resonant pulse contained by a swift, concentric hush—is the fundamental beat of morphogenesis. When this beat repeats and stabilizes across the medium, a pattern is born.
