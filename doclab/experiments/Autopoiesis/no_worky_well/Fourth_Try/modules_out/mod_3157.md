| **Birefringence drift** in fibre        | Use the *same* patch type for both arms; keep gentle bends.                    |
| **Temperature** (n vs T)                | Take baseline and helix reading within minutes of each other.                  |
| **Polarisation scramble** on connectors | Wrap loose FC joints in tin-foil “socks”; tweak wave-plate for max visibility. |
| **Laser coherence length**              | A cheap diode pointer (> 10 cm coherence) is fine for < 2 m arm mismatch.      |
| **Mechanical vibration**                | Sit mirrors on foam; take readings when room is quiet.                         |

If the measured shift is within **±15 %** of $N(\pi+1)$ the Berry-phase origin is strongly supported.  Larger discrepancies mean the helix pitch deviated from $2πR$ or polarisation purity is poor—re-measure the pitch and tighten the wave-plate angle.
