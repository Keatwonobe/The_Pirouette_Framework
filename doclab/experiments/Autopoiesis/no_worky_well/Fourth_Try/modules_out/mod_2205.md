We can now return to the geodesic equation from MATH-005 with this new information. The "force" experienced by a charged particle is the term that makes its path deviate from a straight line.

By calculating the geodesic equation on a coherence manifold where the connection has been modified by the presence of the potential A_mu (the minimal coupling prescription), we find the equation of motion for a particle p is:

dp_mu/d(tau) = q * F_munu * u^nu

Where tau is the proper time and u^nu is the 4-velocity. This is the Lorentz force law, expressed in covariant form. The force dp/d(tau) is proportional to the particle's charge q, its velocity u, and the field strength F.

This proves that the Lorentz force is not an external push. It is the geometric consequence of a particle trying to travel in a straight line (a geodesic) through a region of the coherence manifold that has been "sheared" and "twisted" by the presence of an electromagnetic field.
