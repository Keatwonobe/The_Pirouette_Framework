A critical transition is the physical manifestation of a discontinuity in the solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equation applied to 𝓛_p. As the Temporal Pressure term, V_Γ, changes, the path of maximal coherence can abruptly shift from one stable trajectory to another. The "snap" is this jump between solutions. The metrics in the Signature Suite are our instruments for detecting the seismic shockwave this leap sends through the coherence manifold, allowing us to observe the moment the mathematics of the universe chooses a new verse for its song.
