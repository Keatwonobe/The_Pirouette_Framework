The validation of the framework does not rest on a single "smoking gun" experiment but on the profound weight of consilience. We observe a symphony played on many instruments—a pulsar, a protein, a planet—and find the melody is the same. Each piece of evidence is a case study of a system tracing its natural path—its geodesic—on the manifold of coherence.

The Pirouette Lagrangian, **𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**, defines the objective function for all of reality. A system's "action" is the interplay between its internal coherence (K_τ) and the external Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) it endures. The Principle of Maximal Coherence dictates that a system will always evolve along the path that maximizes this value. The recurring, resonant patterns we observe are the stable, quantized solutions to this equation—the specific notes a system can hold to remain stable against the chaos.
