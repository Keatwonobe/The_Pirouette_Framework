> *“Define the boundary by the shockwave’s edge.”*

1. **Feasibility & Clarity:** Measuring the full hypersurface of parameter perturbations (ΔTa, ΔΓ, phase coherence) in real time is **computationally intensive** and risks **measurement lag**, allowing harm to propagate before detection.  
2. **Anticipatory Governance:** Pre-defined **Parametric Gates** serve as guardrails, preventing high-risk actions at the source rather than merely mapping their aftermath.  
3. **Hybrid Law:** We propose a **dual-phase boundary**:  
   - **Phase 1 (Pre-Act Gate):** Lock down parametric invariants ($T_a$, $\Gamma$, Ki-rate) within safe corridors to deter boundary-hugging attacks.  
   - **Phase 2 (Post-Act Residue):** Use the Wound Channel to audit and, if needed, retroactively sanction violations and adjust gate thresholds.
