summary: "Provides the framework's first major validation by deriving the electron's\
  \ anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) from first principles. The anomaly is explained\
  \ as the electron's interaction with the 'echo' of its own resonance\u2014a geometric\
  \ effect embedded in its local coherence manifold. This module serves as the primary\
  \ proof of the framework's predictive power."
