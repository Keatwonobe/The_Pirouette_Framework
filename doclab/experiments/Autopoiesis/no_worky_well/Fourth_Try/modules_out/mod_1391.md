The output of the Coherence Landscape Mapper is a rich, multi-layered understanding of the system's inner world:

*   **The Landscape Map:** A topographic map of `𝓛_p`, visualizing the system's "islands of stability" and "chasms of chaos."
*   **The Attractor Catalog:** A ranked list of the landscape's peaks, identifying the system's most preferred, coherent, and resilient configurations.
*   **The Coherence Gradient Field:** A vector map illustrating the natural "currents" of change, predicting how the system will respond to perturbations and where it will evolve if left to its own devices.
