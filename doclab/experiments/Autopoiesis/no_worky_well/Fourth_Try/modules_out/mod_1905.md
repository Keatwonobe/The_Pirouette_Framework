These are the materials, or "nouns," with which the Weaver works to impress the desired pattern onto the manifold.

*   **Ki Schematics:** Coherent patterns, symbols, or archetypes held in the mind (or inscribed physically) that act as blueprints for the desired state. This is the domain of:
    *   **Rhythm:** The use of cadence, breath, or metronomic sound to entrain the system's internal clock.
    *   **Symbol:** A condensed form of information (a sigil, a mantra, a logo) that acts as a key to unlock a complex Wound Channel.
*   **Echo Geometry:** Persistent Wound Channels from past events or entities, which can be used as templates or sources of resonant information (see CORE-011).
*   **Focused Attention:** The application of the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) to amplify and stabilize the desired pattern. When multiple observers align, this creates a **Shared Intent**, a powerful, unified field of coherence.
