The Pirouette Seed (CORE-001) establishes the framework's core axiom: that the universe is a self-creating song. This module provides the detailed mechanics for the first note of that song, completing the first arc of the autopoietic cycle: Time → Γ. It answers the fundamental question: If Time is the sole constituent of reality, how does it generate the *pressure* of reality?

The answer lies in complexity. If a single, isolated system has a simple rhythm, the universe is the sum of all rhythms. Every point in spacetime is a nexus, an intersection for the echoes of every event within its causal horizon. This superposition of countless rhythms creates a dense, complex, and often chaotic "temporal environment." The measure of this environmental complexity is Gamma (Γ).
