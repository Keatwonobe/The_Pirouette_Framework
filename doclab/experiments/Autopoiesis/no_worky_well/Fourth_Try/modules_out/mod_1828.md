The protocol for measuring Temporal Coherence is a two-step process of isolating a rhythm and then assessing its internal consistency.

**Step I: Isolate the Rhythm.**
The first task is to identify the core cyclical pattern—the Ki—of the system or subsystem being measured. This involves extracting the phase (`θ`) of the oscillation from the available data. For a complex signal, this can be achieved with tools like the Hilbert transform, which isolates a signal's "heartbeat." For an ensemble of discrete agents (like a flock of birds or a group of traders), it involves measuring the state of each agent within its own cycle.

**Step II: Calculate the Coherence.**
Once the phases of the system's components (`θ_j`) are known, their collective coherence is calculated. The phases are treated as vectors on a unit circle, and their vector average is computed. This is the **Coherence Vector (C)**.

$$ C = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N e^{i\theta_j} $$

The **Coherence Index**—our modern measure of Temporal Coherence—is the squared magnitude of this vector. This value, ranging from 0 (total chaos) to 1 (perfect order), quantifies the degree of alignment.

$$ \text{Coherence Index} = |C|^2 $$
