Every negotiation takes place on a dynamic landscape, a coherence manifold defined by the interplay of each party's internal state and the external pressures they face.

*   **Coherence ($K_\tau$)**: This represents the stability, clarity, and integrity of a party's positionâ€”the "song" of their intent. A party with high internal coherence understands its core interests, priorities, and boundaries. It is not easily swayed by superficial tactics because its position is a stable, resonant pattern.

*   **Temporal Pressure ($V_\Gamma$)**: This is the energetic "cost" of maintaining a position. It is a combination of external pressures (deadlines, market conditions) and internal pressures (impatience, emotional investment). High pressure makes holding a fixed position more difficult, creating a catalyst for movement toward a more stable, lower-cost state.

*   **The Geodesic to Agreement**: The path to a successful agreement is a geodesic on this manifold. It is the sequence of offers, concessions, and discoveries that allows all parties to navigate toward a shared state of maximal coherence for the lowest possible cost. This path, the `Wound Channel` (`CORE-011`), is carved into the manifold by the dialogue itself, becoming the terrain of the relationship.
