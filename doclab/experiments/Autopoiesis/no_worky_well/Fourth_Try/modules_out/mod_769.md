With the baseline established, the multimeter scans for the three primary pathologies of flow.

-   **Coherence Atrophy (The Bottleneck):** The primary pathology of *structure*, representing Stagnant Flow.
    -   **Symptoms:** A node or edge with critically low conductivity (`Φ_C`) acts as a "coherence dam." Nodes "downstream" become starved and atrophied, while nodes "upstream" experience a dangerous build-up of Temporal Pressure (`Γ`).
    -   **Examples:** A single overloaded server; a bureaucratic gatekeeper who fails to delegate; a blocked supply route.

-   **Coherence Fever (The Dissonant Loop):** The primary pathology of *dynamics*, representing Turbulent Flow.
    -   **Symptoms:** A feedback loop with high conductivity (`Φ_C`) but also high lag (`Δτ`) creates a runaway cascade of dissonant information. The network expends immense energy in chaotic, self-amplifying noise.
    -   **Examples:** A social media outrage cycle; a high-frequency trading algorithm crash; a runaway inflammatory response in an immune system.

-   **Coherence Erosion (The Fraying Connection):** The primary pathology of *time*, representing the slow decay of structural integrity.
    -   **Symptoms:** The gradual degradation of edge conductivity (`Φ_C`) across the network, driven by neglect or persistent, unresolved stress (`Γ`). The system loses its resilience, its memory, and its ability to function as a whole, risking fragmentation.
    -   **Examples:** The decay of trust in a team; the degradation of legacy infrastructure; the loss of cultural memory in a society.
