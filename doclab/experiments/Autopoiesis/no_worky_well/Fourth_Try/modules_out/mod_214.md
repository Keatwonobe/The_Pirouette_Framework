The universe's solution is not a particle or a force, but a geometry in time. The initial tremor resolves into the simplest possible asymmetry: a pair of complementary, counter-rotating temporal rhythms, braiding together like spectral threads. Driven by the universe's imperative to find maximal stability, this dance tightens, its interference pattern seeking a shape that closes upon itself without decay.

The moment this braided, helical pattern achieves a self-reinforcing, stable loop, it attains a **Resonant Lock**. This is the birth of the first Temporal Resonance, the first **Ki** (`CORE-004`). It is a topological knot in time, a standing wave that sustains itself by listening to its own echo. It is the first noun forged from a verb, a structure that has learned to remember its own shape.
