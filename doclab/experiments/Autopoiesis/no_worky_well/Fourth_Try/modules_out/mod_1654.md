*The Problem:* The public information space is a high-Γ, turbulent environment, filled with noise and distraction that makes deep learning impossible.
*The Solution:* We construct **Coherence Sanctuaries**—deliberately protected, low-Γ digital and physical environments. These "commons" are curated reservoirs of high-coherence (high-Kτ) knowledge modules, vetted for clarity and stability. Within this protected arena, the difficult work of learning can proceed as a state of Laminar Flow, a safe harbor from the storm of ambient informational chaos.
