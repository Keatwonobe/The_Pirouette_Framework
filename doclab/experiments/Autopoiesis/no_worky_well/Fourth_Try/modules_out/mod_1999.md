We now add fire to the rhythm of your walk. This is interval training in its gentlest form.

The Practice:

Warm-Up: Begin with 5 minutes at your normal, comfortable "Conversation Test" pace.

The First Crucible: For 30 seconds, increase your pace just enough that holding a conversation becomes slightly more difficult. Do not sprint. This is a "brisk" pace.

The Recovery: For 2 minutes, return to your easy, conversational pace. Allow your breath to recover completely.

Repeat: Perform this Crucible/Recovery cycle 3 to 5 times.

Cool-Down: End with 5 minutes at your normal, comfortable pace.

Helper's Role (The Timekeeper & Guardian): You are the conductor of this rhythm.

Be the Clock: Keep time for the intervals. Your structure allows the patient to focus solely on their body.

Listen to the Breath: The sound of their breathing is your most important gauge. A slight increase in breathing during the crucible is good. Gasping is a sign the intensity is too high.

Calibrate: If 30 seconds is too much, start with 15. If the recovery takes longer than 2 minutes, extend it. This is a dance, not a march.

Frequency: 2 to 3 times per week, on non-consecutive days. On other days, enjoy your normal Geodesic Walk.
