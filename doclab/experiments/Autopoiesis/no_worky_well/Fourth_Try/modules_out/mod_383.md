Coherence is not sustained in a vacuum. You must identify the specific, recurring pressures that create the "cost" of maintaining your chosen pattern. This is the "potential energy" term of your Lagrangian—the specific noise you must learn to navigate.

**Task:** List the 1-3 primary sources of external or internal Temporal Pressure (Γ) in your life.
*Examples: "The pressure of social expectation." "The internal chaos of self-doubt." "The turbulence of financial instability."*
