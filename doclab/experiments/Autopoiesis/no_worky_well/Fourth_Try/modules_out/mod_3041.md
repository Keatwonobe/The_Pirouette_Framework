\section*{§8 · Lemma: Gauge Covariance of Σ}
\begin{lemma}
If Σ preserves the Noether current 1-forms of MATH-024, then for any smooth gauge transformation \(U(\tau)\)
\[
\Sigma^\ast(U^{-1}D_\tau U) = U^{-1}D_x U.
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since Σ is measure-preserving and intertwines derivatives by 
\(\partial_\tau=\Sigma_\tau^{\;\mu}\partial_\mu\),
we have \(D_\tau = \partial_\tau + A_\tau\Rightarrow D_x = \Sigma_\tau^{\;\mu}D_\mu\).  
Gauge equivalence is maintained under pull-back, proving covariance.
\end{proof}
