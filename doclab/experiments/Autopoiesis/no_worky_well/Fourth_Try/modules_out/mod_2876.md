In the universe of The Lost Eternal, the Game Master is not a mere storyteller, but the primary architect of the resonant field in which the players exist. The world, its inhabitants, and its very dangers are sculpted from the same fundamental clay as the player characters: Entropy. This module provides the GM with the tools to be a fair and consistent architect, defining a universal system for challenge design. From the mightiest dragon to the subtlest negotiation, every obstacle is built from an Entropic Budget.
