4. Predictions (no free β)
   R1 β is **fixed a priori** by (D_eff, z). With z=2:
   • Sheet‑dominated regime (D_eff=2): β=1 → P∝X^2  (stiffest of allowed set).
   • Filament regime (D_eff=1): β=1/2 → P∝X^{3/2} (baseline used in many superfluid cores).
   • Core/point regime (D_eff=0): β=0 → P∝X (dust‑like limit).
   R2 **Transitions** between regimes imprint **log‑periodic wiggles** in Σ₀ vs. mass and a mild, scale‑localized modulation in the matter power spectrum.
   R3 Vortex lattice spectra: the spacing and stability depend on β through c_s(n); predicts distinct patterns in rapidly rotating halos (ellipticals/ULDM‑analog signatures).
   R4 CMB safety: β plateaus with z=2 keep c_s tiny at recombination on ℓ≲2500; no new phase shift.
