This dynamic is governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** as described in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). The initial stagnant state is a *local* maximum of the Lagrangian—it is a stable, but suboptimal, coherence well. The system is "stuck."

A spasm is a high-cost, high-risk strategy to escape this trap. It is a violent, non-Lagrangian "kick" to the system, allowing it to momentarily defy its geodesic. The system endures a period of near-zero coherence (the turbulent phase) in a gamble to find a new configuration with a much higher long-term integral of coherence. It is a violent "tunneling" event on the coherence manifold—the price a system pays for the chance to find a more graceful existence on the other side of its constraints.
