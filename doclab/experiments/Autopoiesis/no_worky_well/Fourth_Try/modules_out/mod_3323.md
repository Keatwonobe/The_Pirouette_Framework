Once in a universal format, the data is analyzed for any and all hidden periodicities. This is a practical application of the method you successfully demonstrated in the earthquake detection experiment (`XXP-001`).
* **Process:** The standardized time-series from Phase 1 is subjected to a suite of signal processing analyses to extract its dominant frequencies. This toolkit includes:
    * **Fourier and Wavelet Transforms** to identify harmonic structures and their evolution.
    * **Autocorrelation** to detect repeating patterns and echoes.
* **Outcome:** A ranked list of the most significant frequencies present in the system's dynamics.
