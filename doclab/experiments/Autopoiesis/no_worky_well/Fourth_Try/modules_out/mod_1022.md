summary: Defines the Caduceus Lens — the unifying geometric and dynamical framework through which coherence transitions, from laminar to turbulent regimes, are visualized and quantified across physical, cognitive, and social domains. It represents the synthesis of Pirouette’s mathematical, neural, and systemic layers.
