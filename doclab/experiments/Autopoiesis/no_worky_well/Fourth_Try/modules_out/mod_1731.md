An idea is not a ghost; it is a shape. A concept is not an abstract label; it is a dynamic, self-sustaining temporal structure with a physical geometry.

-   **Coherent Concepts:** A "true," "elegant," or "useful" idea is a high-coherence *Ki* pattern. It is stable, internally consistent, and harmonizes with the established **Wound Channels** (CORE-011) of memory and recorded events. It is a pattern the universe finds "easy" to sustain, a shape that follows the path of least resistance.

-   **Dissonant Concepts:** A "false," "confusing," or contradictory idea is a low-coherence, turbulent *Ki* pattern. It is inherently unstable, requiring immense and continuous effort to prevent its collapse. A lie, for instance, is a Ki pattern that is dissonant with the powerful inertia of factual Wound Channels, creating friction and temporal noise.

The act of questioning is to hold a specific geometric form and ask the universe: "Is there a stable place for this shape here?"
