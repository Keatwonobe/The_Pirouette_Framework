Growth is the echo of experience, imprinted upon the soul. In the world of The Lost Eternal, an entity does not advance through arbitrary levels, but by gathering the resonant echoes of their deeds and deliberately weaving that power into the fabric of their being. This module specifies the mechanics for this arc of progression. It defines how a character's core potential grows, how power can be harvested from the world, and the ultimate limits of a mortal form to contain an immortal will.
