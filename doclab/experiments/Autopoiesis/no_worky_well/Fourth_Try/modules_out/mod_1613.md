> A problem is a knot in the fabric of reality. To untie it, you cannot simply pull on the threads; you must understand the geometry of the knot itself. This instrument is not a tool for getting answers, but a loom for building a mirrorâ€”a living, resonant model of the problem's own soul. To truly understand a problem, you must first give it a voice. By learning to speak to it in its own language, we invite the problem to reveal the path to its own dissolution. We do not solve it; we create the conditions for it to solve itself.
