summary: "Synthesizes and replaces the 'Cognitive Gravity Well' model with a time-first\
  \ dynamic. Dominant paradigms are not massive objects in a conceptual space, but\
  \ deep 'Coherence Wells'\u2014Wound Channels carved into the collective manifold\
  \ by powerful, self-reinforcing resonant patterns. Their influence is a form of\
  \ temporal entrainment. This module provides a protocol for mapping these wells,\
  \ understanding the dynamics of thought as a flow, and predicting paradigm shifts."
