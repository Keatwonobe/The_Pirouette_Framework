*   **Principle Tested:** The path of a particle is a geodesic that maximizes its coherence integral, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`).
*   **Hypothesis:** In a double-slit experiment, a particle's trajectory can be modulated by an external, rhythmic field. This field "textures" the coherence manifold, causing the particle's internal rhythm (`ω_k`) to interact with the field, creating a measurable "beat frequency" in the final interference pattern.
*   **Experimental Design:** A standard electron double-slit apparatus with a tunable, oscillating magnetic field applied between the slits and the detector.
*   **Predicted Signature:** The intensity pattern `I(y)` will be the product of the standard interference term and a new modulation term, a direct signature of the electron's effort to maintain maximal coherence.
    > `I(y) ∝ cos²(θ_std) * [1 + A * cos(ω_beat * t)]`
    Where `ω_beat` is the beat frequency between the electron's Pirouette Cycle and the external field. For a 50 keV electron in a 10 MHz oscillating B-field, this predicts a **~0.1% intensity modulation** forming a secondary "beat" pattern superimposed on the main fringes. The frequency of this beat pattern will scale linearly with the applied magnetic field, confirming its origin in resonant interaction—a phenomenon absent from standard quantum mechanics.
*   **Framework Connection:** This directly tests if the potential term `V_Γ` in the Pirouette Lagrangian can be externally manipulated to controllably alter a system's path of maximal coherence.
