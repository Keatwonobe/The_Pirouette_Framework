summary: Introduces the construction and measurement of the Social Dissonance Field ((\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{x},t))) using Hodge decomposition on real-world social interaction graphs. Provides the empirical path to test coherence conservation in human systems, linking Pirouette theory to observable social behavior.
