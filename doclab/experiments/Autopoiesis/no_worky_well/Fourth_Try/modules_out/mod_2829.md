A deep bond can be formed between a wielder and their weapon.

The Bond: By permanently investing at least 9 TEP into a single weapon (for damage, effects, or otherwise), it becomes Fate-Bound. A Fate-Bound weapon will always return to its wielder's hand if lost, thrown, or sold.

Contested Ownership: If another being invests more TEP into the weapon than the original owner, the bond is broken and a new one is formed.
