We promote the classical Pirouette matter sector
[ \mathcal L = g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu C^*,\partial_\nu C + \tfrac12 g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\Gamma,\partial_\nu\Gamma - V(|C|^2,\Gamma) ]
to a quantum field theory on a (possibly curved) **globally hyperbolic** spacetime. Quantization yields quanta of (C) ("coherons", complex scalar) and of (\Gamma) ("pressurons", real scalar). **This does not make "time a particle"**: we quantize a *field valued in temporal pressure*, not the time coordinate itself. Interactions arise from (V), producing Feynman rules in the usual way. Renormalization and EFT power counting govern predictivity.
