The current economic and ecological landscape is a direct result of the fall of the Skazan Order and their master mages, the Prospero. The Prospero could create sustenance from their own will, but their magic was a poor defense. In their fall, they unleashed a chaotic torrent of creation that has permanently scarred the world.

The Environment: Vast fields of wild wheat are plagued by ergot, which blows in hallucinogenic fungal storms. Rivers run red and brackish with the remnants of magical wine. Forests are overgrown and filled with colossal, aggressive swarms of bees.

The Remnants: Ancient Skazan constructs still wander the continent on clockwork paths, their original purpose long forgotten. The trails they leave are often the only safe roads through the hazardous wilderness.
