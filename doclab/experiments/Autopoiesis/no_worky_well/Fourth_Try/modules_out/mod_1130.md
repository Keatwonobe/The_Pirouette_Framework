Before calculating the anomaly, we must first derive the electron's baseline magnetic moment. In this framework, spin is not an intrinsic, irreducible property. It is an emergent, topological feature of a particle's Ki resonance—its stable dance in time.

-   **A scalar particle (spin-0)** is a simple, single-cycle resonance. It returns to its starting state after one 360° rotation.
-   **A fermion (spin-1/2)**, like the electron, is a Ki resonance with the topology of a Möbius strip. It is a helical pirouette in time that must complete **two full cycles (720°)** to return to its original phase-state.

This two-cycle nature is the geometric origin of its fermionic properties. When the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006) is applied to this topologically non-trivial object, its interaction with an external magnetic field is doubled relative to a classical spinning object. This immediately and necessarily yields a baseline gyromagnetic ratio of `g=2`. This is not an assumption; it is a geometric consequence.
