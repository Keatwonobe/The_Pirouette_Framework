An entity first exists with its own intrinsic rhythm. It perceives its environment as a complex superposition of other rhythms—the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). When an entity attempts to impose its internal rhythm upon a world that does not share it, it creates a state of **Turbulent Flow**, as defined in DYN-001.

This is a precise physical condition of temporal desynchronization. The system's internal clock is out of phase with the environment's dominant currents, creating eddies of friction. Energy is squandered not on productive action, but on the exhausting work of maintaining form against the pressure of all other forms. This is the subjective experience of struggle, effort, and inefficiency—a direct violation of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The universe whispers its oldest law: *that which resists, erodes*.
