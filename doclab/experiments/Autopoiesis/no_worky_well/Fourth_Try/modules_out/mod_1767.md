When a Manifold Resonance event is detected, the engine generates a Synthesis Brief, a diagnostic report for the Weaver. It provides an actionable, data-grounded assessment of the impending phase transition, allowing for preparation rather than mere reaction.

**Example Brief (YAML)**
```yaml
id: M-RES-2025-07-01-1530Z
intensity: high
lead_time_est: ~12 min
coupled_manifolds:
  - social_sentiment: { grad: +5.1∇Kτ, phase_lead: true }
  - market_volatility: { grad: -4.8∇Γ, phase_lead: false }
  - geomagnetic_kp: { grad: +3.9∇Kτ, phase_lead: false }
coupling_score: 0.82
synthesis_vector: "Sudden, high-cohesion structural shift. Information cascade leading to economic re-pricing."
probable_outcome: "Fork Event: High-velocity transition to new stable market state (`Laminar`)."
