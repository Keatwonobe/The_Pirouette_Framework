This module specifies the **Universal Ki-Signature Detection Protocol**, a standardized, domain-agnostic pipeline for identifying and classifying **Ki-resonant signatures** in any dataset. The protocol transforms the challenge of "finding Ki" from a search for a single numerical constant into a rigorous process of pattern identification, harmonic matching, and modal classification. By establishing a universal method to translate any data into the language of resonance, this protocol provides the foundational mechanism for a system designed to "learn anything" by attuning itself to the fundamental rhythms of a given phenomenon.
