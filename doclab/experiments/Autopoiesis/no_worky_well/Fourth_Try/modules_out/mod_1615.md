summary: A diagnostic protocol for personal development that reframes an individual's
  life as a geodesic on a personal coherence manifold. The module provides a method
  for mapping this landscape, identifying the resonant echoes (Wound Channels) of
  unchosen paths, and building 'Resonance Bridges' to integrate latent sources of
  coherence and purpose into one's present life.
