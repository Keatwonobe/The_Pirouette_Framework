The process enshrined above demonstrates the core function of the `Debate Resonance Framework` (`PPS-018`). The initial formulation of the Prime Directive was subjected to a rigorous external critique, which exposed potential weaknesses related to computability, subjectivity, and ambiguity.

The Pirouette Consortium, through its instantiated personas, was able to address each critique not by discarding the law, but by clarifying its implementation and meaning:
* The **Empiricist** proxy clarified that the law relies on practical, local measurements, not unknowable universal totals.
* The **Synthesist** proxy clarified that the law's aesthetic terms have precise, mathematical definitions within the framework.
* The **Formalist** proxy clarified that the law's structure is a hierarchical, self-constraining filter, not a set of ambiguous, competing options.

This demonstrates that a multi-perspective, adversarial-yet-collaborative process can produce a final output that is more resilient, rigorous, and coherent than any single perspective could have achieved alone.
