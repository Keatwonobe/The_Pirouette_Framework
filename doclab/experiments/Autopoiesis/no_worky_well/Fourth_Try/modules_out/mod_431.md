The existence of the Wound Channel has profound implications for the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. The geometry of the Wound Channel adds a history-dependent component to the Temporal Pressure term, `V_Γ`.

The "cost" of maintaining coherence is no longer just a function of the external environment; it is also a function of an entity's own past actions. To deviate from an established path—to break a habit or change one's identity—means carving a new channel against the grain of the old one. This act of "forgetting" has a real, calculable cost within the Lagrangian. Inertia is the energetic price of ignoring one's own echo.
