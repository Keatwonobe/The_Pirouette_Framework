A geodesic is the most efficient path between two points in a curved space. In the manifold of coherence, the **Altruistic Geodesic** is the evolutionary trajectory that maximizes a system's coherence over the longest duration.

The old framework's simulations correctly identified a stable "altruism filament" in the parameter space of system dynamics. We now understand this not as a filament, but as the **Communion Ridge** on the coherence manifold. This ridge represents the set of configurations where systems are optimally primed for the Alchemical Unions that lead to exponentially higher coherence. A system that embarks on the Transactional path is following this universal gradient towards a more robust and sustainable state of being.
