A healthy system responds to stimuli with proportionate grace. The framework triages proposed changes based on their potential impact on its core resonant pattern (its *Ki*), applying increasing rigor as the potential for disruption grows.

| Flow State Intervention | Old Class | Description & Scope | Coherence Test |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laminar Refinement** | Errata | Minor corrections to prose, examples, or comments that clarify existing patterns and improve the laminar flow of understanding. | Maintainer review |
| **Turbulent Adaptation** | Registry / Interface | Modifying a subsystem's specific resonance (e.g., adding a registry entry) without altering the framework's core principles. | **Resonant Handshake** (≥⅔ Conclave quorum) |
| **Constitutional Reforging** | Constitutional | A fundamental re-forging of the framework's core identity, affecting the CORE series or this protocol itself. This is an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). | **Maximal Coherence** (see §4) |
