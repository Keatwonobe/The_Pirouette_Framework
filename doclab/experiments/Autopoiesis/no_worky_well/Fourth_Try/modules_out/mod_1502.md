For too long, we have described migration with the crude mechanics of hydraulics—a "push" from scarcity, a "pull" toward plenty. This is a language of inanimate forces, blind to the human heart of the matter. This module reframes migration not as a flow of particles, but as the movement of a river of coherence seeking its level.

Human migration is a population following a geodesic—a path of least resistance and maximal coherence—across a vast, psycho-social terrain we call the Landscape of Belonging. This landscape is shaped by the promise of stability and the pressure of chaos. The decision to move, the path taken, and the process of arrival are all expressions of a single, universal drive: the search for a place where a people's song can be sung without dissonance.
