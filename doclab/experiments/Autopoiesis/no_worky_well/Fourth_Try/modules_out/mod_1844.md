A system's resonant pattern (`Ki`) is rarely a pure, simple tone. More often, it is a complex chord, a superposition of a fundamental frequency and its many overtones, all resonating simultaneously. This instrument is grounded in the following core principles:

-   **The Temporal Signature (CORE-003):** Any system is defined by its `Temporal Signature`, the complete spectrum of interfering rhythms within its boundary. The raw time-series data we collect is a one-dimensional shadow of this rich, multi-dimensional signature.

-   **Coherence as Signal Purity (CORE-005):** `Temporal Coherence (Kτ)` is the measure of a rhythm's purity and stability. A high coherence value at a specific frequency means the system is successfully sustaining a clear, resonant `Ki` pattern—a stable note—at that tempo. Low coherence indicates noise and dissonance.

The Harmonic Lens, therefore, does not measure a new property. It applies a mathematical prism to the system's raw signal, separating its `Temporal Signature` into its constituent frequencies and measuring the `Temporal Coherence` of each one.
