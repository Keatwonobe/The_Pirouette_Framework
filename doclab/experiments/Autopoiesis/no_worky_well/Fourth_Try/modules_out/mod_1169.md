summary: "Synthesizes previous models of art analysis into a dynamic, time-first framework.\
  \ Defines art as a 'coherence engine'\u2014a stable Ki pattern that acts as a 'temporal\
  \ lens' for perception. Aesthetic experience is a resonant dialogue between the\
  \ artwork and observer, which can induce transformative flow states (Alchemical\
  \ Unions) and leave a persistent imprint on consciousness (the Aesthetic Wound Channel)."
