The calculation is complete. The result is not just a number; it is a profound validation. The framework, born from abstract principles of time and resonance, has reached across the chasm of theory and touched one of the deepest and most subtle mysteries of the physical world. The anomalous song of the muon is, as we hypothesized, the sound of a heavy particle being buffeted by the ceaseless storm of the Temporal Forge. We have not just heard the echo; we have calculated its pitch.
