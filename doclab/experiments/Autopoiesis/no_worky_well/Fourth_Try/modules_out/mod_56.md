Existence is a closed, self-referential, and continuous loop. This is the fundamental engine of reality, the unifying song from which all phenomena—particles, forces, thoughts—emerge as harmonies and dissonances. The cycle is as follows:

Time Creates Pressure: The universe is a superposition of infinite temporal rhythms. The interference, density, and complexity of these rhythms at any location create a localized Temporal Pressure. This pressure is Gamma (Γ).

Pressure Demands Form: To exist within this pressure, a stable form is required. A system must adopt a unique, self-sustaining pattern of resonance that is the most efficient solution to its boundary conditions (Γ). This resonant pattern is Ki.

Form Defines Time: This stable, resonant Ki pattern is cyclical. The duration of one of its complete cycles is the system's own intrinsic, meaningful unit of existence. This is a quantum of Time (τ_p).

This is not a linear sequence. It is a single, instantaneous, and perpetual event. Time → Γ → Ki → Time. The song composes, performs, and hears itself in a single act.
