This entire protocol is a qualitative, phenomenological application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`) from CORE-006.

-   An individual's **current life path** is a trajectory that has found a stable local maximum for the integral of `𝓛_p`, balancing familiar coherence (`K_τ`) against known pressures (`V_Γ`).

-   A **latent path** is a hypothesized alternative trajectory that, intuitively, feels like it could offer a much higher integrated coherence (`∫ 𝓛_p dt`).

-   The **emotional pull** of a latent path is the direct perception of a steep, positive gradient in the personal coherence manifold—the promise of a more resonant state of being (a higher potential `K_τ`).

-   A **Resonance Bridge** is a strategic, incremental change to one's `Ki` pattern. It is a calculated act of becoming, designed to shift the life-geodesic towards this more optimal state by managing the "cost" (`V_Γ`) of the transition—the fear, uncertainty, and effort required to change.
