> An experience is a wave that passes. A memory is the choice to teach the riverbed its shape.

An entity's existence is a path through the coherence manifold. `CORE-011` establishes that every experience impresses a geometric scar upon this path—a **Wound Channel**. Most are fleeting ripples, temporary echoes whose forms are smoothed over by the ceaseless current of new moments. The universe, by default, trends toward forgetfulness.

But some events are seismic shocks—a foundational trauma, a profound epiphany, a love that reorders one's being. These events carve a deep and intricate Wound Channel, a high-fidelity echo so powerful it momentarily redefines the entity's world. This echo is the raw material of identity.
