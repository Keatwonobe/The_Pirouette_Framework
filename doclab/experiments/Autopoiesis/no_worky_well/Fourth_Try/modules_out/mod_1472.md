For any given system, the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) admits multiple stable solutions for its Temporal Resonance pattern (Ki). The two most fundamental are the static and dynamic states, which are distinct modes of coherence.

**Ki_static (The Inward Song):** This is the resonant pattern that maximizes a system's coherence when it is at rest relative to its local environment. It is an internally-focused harmony, optimized for stability and self-reinforcement within the deep "well" of its own static Wound Channel. It minimizes interaction to preserve its form; it is the resonance of being *in a place*.

**Ki_dynamic (The Outward Song):** This is the resonant pattern that maximizes coherence when the system is in motion. It is an externally-focused harmony, optimized for efficient propagation along a geodesic on the coherence manifold. Its structure is shaped to surf the surrounding currents with minimal friction; it is the resonance of being *on a path*.

A system does not smoothly interpolate between these two states. It must leap from one stable configuration to the other.
