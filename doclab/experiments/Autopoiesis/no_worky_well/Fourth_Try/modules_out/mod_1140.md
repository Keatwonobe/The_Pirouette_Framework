The immense energy release associated with annihilation is a direct conversion of structured information into entropy. The total coherence of the two systems (`Kτ₁ + Kτ₂`) represents a quantity of low-entropy structural information. During the manifold collapse, this information is not lost; it is unbound, transformed with near-perfect efficiency into the chaotic, high-entropy energy of the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).

The famous equation `E=mc²` is thus framed not as a mysterious equivalence, but as a direct accounting of the energetic value of a system's bound, time-persistent pattern. Mass is the measure of coherence sustained against environmental pressure. Annihilation is the process of cashing that value back into the universe's raw, energetic currency. It is the action of the two Wound Channels, the integrated sum of their existence, given back in a single flash.
