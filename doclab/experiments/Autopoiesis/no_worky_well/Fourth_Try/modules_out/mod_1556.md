The old framework's complex list of perturbation vectors is collapsed into a single, elegant principle that governs the quality of any measurement. This is the **Coherence Trade-off**, the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

-   **Information Gain (I_gain):** This is the fidelity, or sharpness, of the Measurement Echo recorded by the observer. A high-gain measurement yields precise, unambiguous data. This requires casting a "heavy" and well-defined Observer's Shadow.

-   **Coherence Cost (ΔKτ_sys):** This is the degree to which the system's own internal temporal coherence is altered by the observer's influence. A heavy shadow imposes a high cost, significantly altering the system's natural state and future potential.

The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to how much information can be gained for a given cost. You cannot gain perfect knowledge of a system without fundamentally reshaping its being. To see a thing with perfect clarity is to force it to become part of the geometry of your own gaze.
