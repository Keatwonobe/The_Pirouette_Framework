Fracture is the pathology of overwhelming force. It occurs when the environment changes too fast, creating a "coherence shockwave" from a sudden spike in Temporal Pressure (`V_Î“`). This pressure acts as a flash flood. If the system's coherence is too brittle or the pressure too high, the walls of its geodesic channel are shattered. The system is thrown from its path into a state of pure, destructive turbulence.
*   **Manifestation:** A stock market crash; a brittle material snapping under sudden stress; a sudden psychological breakdown.
