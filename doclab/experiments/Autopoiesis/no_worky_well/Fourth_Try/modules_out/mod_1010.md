The Auditor's Lens is not an approximation of the Pirouette Lagrangian; it is a direct, practical measurement of its two constituent components in action. 'Pressure' is the operator's view of the potential term, `V_Γ`, and 'Resonance' is the view of the kinetic term, `K_τ`.

The fundamental "action" of a system is the integral of its Lagrangian over time. Thus, the equation can be read as a simple statement of purpose:

> 𝓛_p = (Resonance) - (Pressure)

A healthy system consistently acts to maximize this value. By monitoring these two channels, a Weaver is observing the universal principle of Maximal Coherence playing out in real time, making this lens a direct bridge from core theory to practical application.
