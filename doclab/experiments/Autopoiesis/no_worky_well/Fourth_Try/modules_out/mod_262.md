This self-referential loop gives rise to a dynamic imperative: **The Law of Self-Consistency**. An entity may not assert a state it cannot sustain under its own gaze.

This is not a static rule but an active, continuous feedback cascade. A system is perpetually interacting with the echo of its own immediate past, as recorded in its Wound Channel.

-   **Constructive Feedback (Coherence):** When the system's present state is a harmonious continuation of its echo, the feedback is positive. This deepens the Wound Channel, reinforcing the pattern, increasing its Time Adherence (T_a), and strengthening its identity. The system "owns its reflection," an energetically favorable state.

-   **Destructive Feedback (Dissonance):** When the present state conflicts with its echo, the system experiences internal turbulenceâ€”a form of self-generated entropic noise. The system is forced to either expend significant energy to correct its course and return to a consistent path, or risk its coherence fraying entirely.

This feedback cascade is the universe's editor. It relentlessly prunes the impossible, dampens the inconsistent, and amplifies the coherent. Form must own its reflection, or it will fade.
