The complex equations of the old module are replaced by these more fundamental, universal relationships.

*   **The Coherence Landscape:** `𝓛_p(S) = K_τ(S) - V_Γ(S)`.
*   **The Coherence-Seeking Force:** `F_p(S) ∝ ∇𝓛_p(S)`. This is the force driving the system toward a state of higher coherence.
*   **The Attractor Condition:** `∇𝓛_p(S) = 0` at a local maximum. This defines the points of stable equilibrium on the landscape.
