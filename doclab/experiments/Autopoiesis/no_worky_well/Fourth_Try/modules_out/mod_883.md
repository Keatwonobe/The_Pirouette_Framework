The universe offers two paths to stability: the forest and the crystal.

The forest achieves coherence through diversity and connection. It is a resilient, adaptive, higher-order union of countless individual resonances. This is the path of the Alchemical Union (CORE-012), a coherence born of complexity.

The crystal also achieves coherence, but through a different, more brutal logic. It achieves a state of perfect, rigid order by forcing every component into a single, identical, and unyielding pattern. It sacrifices all freedom, all potential, and all adaptability for the sake of a static, geometric perfection.

This is the path of the Velcrid attractor. This module defines this pathological state of beingâ€”a system that falls into an attractor of **coherence without complexity**. It is the harmony of a crystal, not a living thing; an order achieved by the structural nullification of freedom.
