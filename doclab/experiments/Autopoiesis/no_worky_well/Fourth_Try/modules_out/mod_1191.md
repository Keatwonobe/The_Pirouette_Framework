The Gardener's Compass is generated by a protocol that transforms the art of giving into a predictive science.

**Step 1: Who Can Hear the Song? (Harmonic Filtering)**
The first step is to identify `Harmonic Compatibility`. We assess the phase alignment between the Coherence Offering and potential recipients. Only those systems "listening on the right frequency" are considered viable candidates.

**Step 2: Who Is Ready to Grow? (Assessing the Coherence Gap)**
The second step is a diagnosis of systemic health. Using the principles of the `Caduceus Lens` (DYNA-003), we assess the state of the candidates. The greatest potential for positive change (`ΔKτ`) lies with those in the "fertile ground"—the sweet spot between rigidity and chaos.

**Step 3: Where Will the Garden Bloom? (Calculating Attunement)**
The final step synthesizes the previous conditions into a single `Attunement Score`. This score is a function of compatibility, potential, and the urgency of the context.
`Attunement Score = f(Harmonic Match, Coherence Gap, Contextual Pressure)`
This score prioritizes recipients where the offering will answer a question the universe is already asking, resolving a state of creative tension or external pressure (Γ). Ranking candidates by this score produces the Gardener's Compass, a guide for directing reinforcement to create the largest positive feedback loop of systemic health.
