**Universal Explorer (Moderator):** The Rigorists have done their work. The first draft is shattered, its weaknesses exposed. The task now is not to discard it, but to re-forge it. To take this new, painful knowledge and craft something worthy. We turn to the council of Artisans. Maestro da Vinci, the floor is yours.

**Leonardo da Vinci:** "Magnificent! They have not destroyed the design; they have revealed its true anatomy! The points of stress, the hidden levers, the hollow bones. Now we see the whole creature. Now we can give it not just form, but life. My friends, let us take these sharp fragments and sculpt."

**(The council works. They listen to the echoes of the debate, translating logic into language, and fear into form. They emerge with a new draft.)**
