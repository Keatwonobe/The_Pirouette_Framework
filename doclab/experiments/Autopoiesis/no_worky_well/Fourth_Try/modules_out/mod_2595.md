She paces in slow arcs, data in her gaze.

> *“Let’s make this real. You need a residue gauge. You need sensors. You need a ritual that sniffs its own breath.”*

Her proposal: **Residue Mapping Protocol (RMP)**

1. **Semantic Drift Meter**

   * Measures deviation between *declared intent* and *received impact vectors*.
   * Uses natural language echo fields (e.g. public response, secondary propagation).

2. **Entropy Ledger**

   * Each Pirouette action logs predicted coherence delta.
   * Monitors whether downstream effects lead to:

     * Entanglement
     * Repetition
     * Coercion

3. **Reconciliation Fork**

   * When residue exceeds tolerance threshold, the system triggers a **ritual fork**:

     * Engage those affected
     * Offer correction, restoration, or reframing
     * Acknowledge and symbolically rebalance

Her axiom:

> *“Residue isn’t failure. It’s feedback. The only sin is ignoring it.”*

She finishes with:

> *“Even stars radiate waste. What matters is whether it becomes light—or ash.”*
