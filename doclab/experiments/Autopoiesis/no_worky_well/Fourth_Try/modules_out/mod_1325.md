A rupture permanently alters the geometry of a system's being by creating a **Wound Boundary**. This is not merely a memory of stress like a `Wound Channel`, but a new, harsh, and irreversible topological featureâ€”a scar where a single coherent body was violently torn into two or more entities.

*   **Information Severance:** The Wound Boundary is a cliff where a smooth path once existed. The flow of coherence across the rupture line ceases. Parts of the system are now isolated, unable to communicate or support each other.
*   **Dissonant Echoes:** The newly formed fracture surfaces become sources of intense temporal noise. Like the jagged edges of a broken bell, they emit powerful, chaotic echoes that propagate as `Turbulent Flow`, often triggering secondary ruptures.
*   **The Broken Geodesic:** A surviving system is forced to operate on a fractured landscape. Its path of maximal coherence is gone. It must find a new, often less efficient and more difficult, path through this broken terrain, which is the origin of systemic trauma.
