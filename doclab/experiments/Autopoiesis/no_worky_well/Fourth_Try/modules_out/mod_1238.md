The core of the Crucible is its physics engine, which models how a system's path evolves in response to change. It does not guess; it calculates the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—for the system under the influence of the proposed interventions.

| Component                | Role                                                                                                 | Implementation Detail                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Lagrangian Solver**    | Integrates the system's state according to the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**.                  | GPU-accelerated numerical integration.     |
| **Agent Layer**          | Models autonomous entities whose decisions create micro-perturbations on the coherence manifold.       | Event-driven, state-machine agents.        |
| **Intervention API**     | Allows the injection of timed actions that alter the local `Kτ` or `Γ` parameters of the Lagrangian.   | gRPC API for applying interventions.       |
| **Diagnostic Bus**       | Streams the system's health metrics in real-time, allowing observation of the system's evolution.      | Pub/sub message queue for coherence metrics. |
| **Evolutionary Optimizer** | Autonomously searches the parameter space of an intervention to find the optimal configuration.         | Bayesian optimization or genetic algorithms. |
