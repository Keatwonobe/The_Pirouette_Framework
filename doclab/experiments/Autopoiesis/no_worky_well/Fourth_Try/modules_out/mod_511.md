The old ledger is obsolete. We redefine the fundamental quantities of systemic health through the direct, physical principles of `CORE-013: The River of Information`.

**Information is Coherence (Asset: Kτ):**
A system's information content, previously modeled as `Info-enthalpy`, is a direct measure of its temporal coherence (Kτ). This is the "signal"—the stable, sharply defined `Ki` pattern it actively maintains. Information is not a static commodity to be stored; it is the ongoing performance of a system's resonant song. This represents the asset side of the ledger.

**Entropy is Environmental Pressure (Liability: V_Γ):**
Entropy is not a property internal to the system, but the "cost of living" imposed by its environment. It is the measure of the dissonance and chaos of the local Temporal Pressure (Γ), the background static of the Temporal Forge. This erosive force, the potential `V_Γ`, constantly works to degrade the system's pattern. This represents the liability side of the ledger.

**Health is Net Vitality (Equity: 𝓛_p):**
A system's "free coherence"—its capacity to persist, adapt, and do meaningful work—is its net vitality, as measured by the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) from `CORE-006`. Health is the measure of how successfully a system's internal coherence exceeds the erosive pressure of its environment.
