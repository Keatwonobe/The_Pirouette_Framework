To understand a collapse is to perform a pre-mortem or a post-mortem using the principles of flow.

1.  **Map the Currents:** Identify the system's vital flows—energy, resources, information, trust—that defined its healthy, laminar state.
2.  **Diagnose the Pathology:** Determine the primary failure mode. Is it a sudden storm (Turbulence), a critical blockage (Stagnation), or a slow decay (Erosion)?
3.  **Trace the Cascade:** Chart how the initial fracture propagated through the system. How did the failure of one current starve or overwhelm another? This reveals the system's hidden interdependencies.
4.  **Assess the Wound Channel:** Examine the integrity of the system's core identity. Is the memory of its healthy pattern recoverable (Elastic)? Or has it been irrevocably erased (Critical)? This final step determines whether the task ahead is one of healing or of composing something new from the ruins.
