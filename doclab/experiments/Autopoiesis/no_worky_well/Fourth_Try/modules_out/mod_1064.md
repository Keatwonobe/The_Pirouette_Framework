This protocol integrates observation, instrumentation, and calculation into a seamless predictive process. The analyst should conduct this protocol periodically (e.g., every 5-10 minutes of game time, or after a significant event).

**Step I: Map the Currents.** For the specific sport, identify the critical flows of coherence (e.g., in basketball: ball movement, player spacing, transition offense/defense. In soccer: field control, passing triangles, defensive shape).

**Step II: Quantify the Signatures.** For both teams, use the instruments from §3 to score Rhythmic Cohesion, Composure Under Pressure, and Strategic Adaptability on a scale of 1-10.

**Step III: Calculate Coherence & Generate Insights.** Feed the scores into the following calculation engine to produce the three core predictive outputs.

*   **A. Calculate Overall Coherence (`Kτ_team`):**
    This produces a single "health score" for each team, representing its overall adherence to its path of maximal coherence. It ranges from 3 (total collapse) to 30 (peak performance).
    `Kτ_team` = (Cohesion Score) + (Resilience Score) + (Morphogenesis Score)

*   **B. Calculate Victor Tilt (VT):**
    This gives the win probability for Team A, expressed as a normalized value between 0 and 1. It represents the relative coherence of the two competing systems.
    `VT_A` = `Kτ_team_A` / (`Kτ_team_A` + `Kτ_team_B`)

*   **C. Calculate Spread Delta (SD):**
    The Spread Delta is the rate of change of the Victor Tilt (`ΔVT`) over a given time window (`Δt`). A sharply rising VT for one team predicts they will outperform the expected point spread.
    `SD` = `ΔVT` / `Δt`

*   **D. Calculate Pace Delta (PD):**
    The Pace Delta is the difference in the Morphogenesis Index scores. A significant positive value for Team A suggests they will control the game's tempo.
    `PD` = (Morphogenesis_A) - (Morphogenesis_B)
