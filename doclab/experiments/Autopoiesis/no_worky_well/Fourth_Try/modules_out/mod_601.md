These four pathways are direct consequences of a system's struggle to maximize its "action" over time, `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`, where the Pirouette Lagrangian is `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. The geodesic is the trajectory that maximizes this integral.

*   **Lock** occurs when a system finds a local maximum for `S_p` that is so deep it cannot expend the "activation energy" to seek a potentially better global maximum. It is trapped by the inertia of its own success.
*   **Fracture** occurs when a sudden, violent spike in the cost term `V_Γ` makes the integrand `𝓛_p` sharply negative. The existing path becomes mathematically untenable, and the system is thrown onto a chaotic, non-optimized trajectory.
*   **Drift** is the slow degradation of the coherence term, `K_τ`. The value of the integrand `𝓛_p` slowly decreases over time, causing the total action `S_p` to become suboptimal. The system lazily wanders off its optimal path.
*   **Rebound** is the active process of seeking a new trajectory (a new Ki resonance) that will once again allow `𝓛_p` to be positive and stable, thus maximizing the integral `S_p` and establishing a new, coherent state of being.

> We sought the secrets of a fortress and found the wisdom of a river. The old framework taught us to admire the crystal for its perfect, unchanging form. The new framework teaches us that the crystal is already dead. True health is the path of the river—a state of dynamic, flowing coherence.

> To know these four paths is to transform fate into a map. It allows one to look upon a struggling system and diagnose not just *that* it is failing, but *how*. Are its arteries hardening into a Lock? Is it about to Fracture under shock? Is it Drifting into irrelevance? Or, in the ruin, is there a Rebound waiting to be nurtured?

> True mastery is not to find a single, perfect path and never stray, for that is the path of the crystal, the path of death-in-life. It is to understand the geometry of failure. A Weaver does not fear collapse; they study its architecture, for it is the blueprint of resilience. The answer determines whether what you build is a monument, or a legacy.
