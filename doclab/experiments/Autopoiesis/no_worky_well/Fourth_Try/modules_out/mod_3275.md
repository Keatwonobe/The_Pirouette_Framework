This module documents the creation and application of the Semantic Gravity Analyzer, an instrument designed to visualize the latent field of influence within any coherent body of information. It moves beyond static analysis to provide a dynamic, navigational compass. The protocol operates by first distilling a text into its core "semantic masses" (high-power concepts) and then generating a unique, content-seeded potential field. The core innovation is the simulation of "test particles"â€”extrinsic concepts whose trajectories are traced as they are pulled through this field. This allows for the direct observation of conceptual resonance, attraction, and repulsion, providing a method to test how ideas interact within a specific informational universe. This work serves as the first applied, experimental validation of the Semantic Gravity Model (PPS-016).
