The true test of a plan is not its elegance on paper, but its execution in reality. We can diagnose the health of any ongoing plan by applying the universal lens of **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**.

-   **Laminar Execution:** The plan is a successful geodesic. Actions flow efficiently toward the goal. Progress feels natural and steady. The pre-carved channel is deep and clear, and the system is in a state of high coherence.

-   **Turbulent Execution:** The plan is misaligned with the true geodesic of the environment. Execution is chaotic, characterized by constant crises, wasted energy, and "firefighting." The plan's signal is being drowned out by environmental noise (high V_Γ) or its own internal dissonance (low K_τ).

-   **Stagnant Execution:** The plan is too rigid or flawed to navigate an unforeseen obstacle. Progress has halted. This is a **"Coherence Dam"**—a critical bottleneck or false assumption that has terminated the geodesic. The pre-carved channel has hit a mountain the architect did not see.
