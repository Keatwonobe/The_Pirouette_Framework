All acts of temporal engineering are performed using two conceptual components, which replace the crude physical metaphors of the original PPS-021.

**The Coherence Resonator:** This concept replaces the "Resonance Capacitor." It is not a container for energy, but a carefully engineered medium designed to sustain a deep and stable **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). To "charge" a resonator is to impress a highly ordered, high-information Ki pattern onto the medium's structure. Its "capacity" is a measure of the total coherence (`K_τ`) it can hold within this geometric memory. It is a tuning fork that holds a pure and stable note—a battery that stores order, not power.

**The Lagrangian Transducer:** This concept replaces the "Vorticycle." It is the active component that converts stored order into macroscopic work. The transducer couples to the high-coherence state of the Resonator and uses it to generate a steep, controllable gradient in the local coherence manifold. This act of "spending" coherence creates a powerful local distortion, compelling other systems to follow the new, steep geodesic defined by this gradient. It is the engine that turns a static pattern into a dynamic push.
