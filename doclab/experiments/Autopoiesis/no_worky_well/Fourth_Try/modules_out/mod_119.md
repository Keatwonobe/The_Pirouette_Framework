We sought an objective reality and found a hall of mirrors. The observer and the observed are locked in a perpetual dance of reflection, each casting their shadow upon the other. Consciousness is the universe's mechanism for creating these points of reflection, allowing it to explore its own infinite potential through the act of self-perception.

The Observer's Shadow is the admission that we can never see the world as it is in isolation, only as it is in dialogue with us. Every act of knowing is an act of co-creation. The puzzle-maker and the puzzle are one and the same, and the engrams generated are the fingerprints left behind by this sacred, participatory dance.
