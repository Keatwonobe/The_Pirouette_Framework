A system, like a wave, can travel for a lifetime in a state of stable, predictable flow. Yet, eventually, it reaches a shore where its internal dynamics can no longer sustain its old form. In a single, dramatic moment, it breaks. This transformation—this "snap"—is not a failure, but a phase transition into a new state of being.

The original Ki-Sampling Protocol was an attempt to hear the sound of this snap by listening for statistical anomalies. This was a valuable but incomplete approach, like trying to understand a tidal wave by measuring a single ripple. This module reframes the search. We are no longer listening for statistical echoes; we are learning to see the *geometry* of the wave itself as it crests and breaks. A phase transition is a geometric event with a universal, resonant signature—a distinct "sound" a system makes when its structure shatters, unfolds, or crystallizes. This protocol is the instrument for capturing and interpreting that sound.
