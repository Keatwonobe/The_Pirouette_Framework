summary: "Provides the formal mathematical proof for the Gladiator Force, deriving the principles of asymptotic freedom and confinement from a scale-dependent feedback loop. This module extends the sketch in MATH-001 by proving that the characteristic linear-plus-Coulomb potential is a necessary consequence of a system's own resonant intensity feeding back into its local Temporal Pressure (Î“)."
