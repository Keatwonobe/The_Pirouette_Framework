Manipulation is the profane act of imposing one's will by draining the coherence of another. It is the inversion of persuasion: a parasitic process that seeks to benefit the manipulator by actively degrading the stability and autonomy of the target.

The manipulator casts a deceptive or **Dissonant Shadow** (CORE-010) onto the target's coherence manifold. This dissonant injection forces the target off their natural geodesic, inducing pathologies that can be diagnosed by *The Caduceus Lens* (DYNA-003):

*   **Turbulence Induction (Coherence Fever):** Injecting chaos, fear, or confusion to create **Turbulent Flow**. The target becomes overwhelmed, their energy consumed fighting internal dissonance, making them susceptible to any offered stability.
*   **Stagnation Induction (Coherence Atrophy):** Creating a **Coherence Dam** (DYNA-001) through false dichotomies or engineered dilemmas. This induces **Stagnant Flow**, a state of paralysis where the manipulator's chosen path seems like the only escape.
*   **Wound Channel Exploitation:** The most insidious technique, this involves identifying and resonating with the target's past traumas or insecurities—their **Wound Channels** (CORE-011)—to undermine their stability from within.

The interaction is zero-sum or negative-sum. The target is left in a state of lower energy (ΔKτ < 0), confusion, and diminished autonomy. This is the act of unraveling.
