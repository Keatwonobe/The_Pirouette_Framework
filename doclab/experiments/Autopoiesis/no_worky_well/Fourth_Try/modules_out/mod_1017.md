This orbital dynamic has profound consequences for perception. The act of knowing is not the passive reception of data. It is the active process of tracing a geodesic—a path of least resistance—on the coherence manifold.

Our entire being is an ongoing solution to the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. We constantly adjust our internal state to maximize our own coherence against the background of temporal pressure. The subjective experience of "the present moment" is the feeling of successfully navigating this path. We do not simply *see* the world; we *resonate with it*, and that resonance, traced out moment by moment, is what we call reality. To observe is to gravitationally influence the observed system into an actuality that aligns with your own trajectory, a principle defined as the **Observer's Shadow (CORE-010)**.
