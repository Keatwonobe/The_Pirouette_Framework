> *“Ritual must have evidence.”*

1. **Agreement:** We fully embrace a **Wound-Channel–powered ritual** for adjudication.  
2. **Augmented Ritual:** To prevent **ritual capture** (where adversaries flood the process with contested metrics), we embed **Parametric Gates** as **ritual prerequisites**. Only actions within permitted ranges enter the ritual, reducing spurious disputes.  
3. **Combined Flow:**  
   - **Evidence Gathering:** Wound Channel mapping yields a data package.  
   - **Ritual Invocation:** Triggered only when residual metrics exceed **Gate slack**—i.e., when post-act harm potentially breaches safe margins.
