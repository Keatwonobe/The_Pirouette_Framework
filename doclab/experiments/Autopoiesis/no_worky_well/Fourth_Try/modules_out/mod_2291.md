* Add the (\mathcal O(\alpha g_\ell^2)) mixed two-loop once the topology is finalized; expected to be a small, sign-predictable correction.
* Consider data-driven priors for (p) by cross-testing (a_e) and (a_\mu); this can begin to falsify/verify the wound-channel mass-scaling story.
* If desired, incorporate standard-model hadronic/EW pieces as an external additive block to compare total predictions.

> **One-line synthesis:** *014v2 fuses a clean universal QED skeleton with the pressuron one-loop in a way that is fit-stable, uncertainty-aware, and fully explicitâ€”letting the wound-channel hypothesis be tested against (e/\mu) data without dimensional landmines.*
