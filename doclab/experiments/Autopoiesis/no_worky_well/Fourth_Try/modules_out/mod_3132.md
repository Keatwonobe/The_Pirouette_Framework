1. **Relativistic boost of the helix** – show how a co-moving observer sees the pitch length-contract and converts $K_i^{(0)}=1.5$ into the two empirical numbers $K_i^{\text{rest}}\approx4.14159$ and $K_i^{\text{motion}}=4\pi/3\approx4.18879$ through a single Lorentz-factor formula; this will slot into Section B.
2. **Dimensional audit** – tabulate every term in the Spiral-Extended Lagrangian and verify that inserting $K_i^{(0)}$ keeps the action density in joules · metre$^{-3}$; this is the focus of Section C.

With Section A now rigorously anchored in standard fibre-bundle geometry and Berry-phase mathematics, the path is clear to complete the empirical calibration and retire any remaining numerology claims.
