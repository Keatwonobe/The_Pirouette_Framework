The mechanism of leverage is not an external "force," but a subtle modification of the system's own landscape of choice. The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) states that all systems evolve along a path that maximizes their coherence.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ` (Temporal Coherence - Temporal Pressure)

A brute-force approach attempts to "push" the system by applying massive external pressure, which is inefficient and creates turbulence. The resonant approach is one of persuasion. An external, coherent signal (`ψ_ext`) does not add significant energy. Instead, it creates a localized "coherence well," subtly reshaping the landscape of Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) at the interface.

Mathematically, the external signal modifies the potential term of the Lagrangian:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V'_Γ`
where `V'_Γ = V_Γ - β * f(ψ_ext, Ki_sys)`

Here, `β` represents the coupling efficiency, which is maximized when the external signal is harmonically resonant with a potential stable state of the system.

The result is a new, attractive geodesic. The system, in its relentless search for its own most stable state, *chooses* to flow toward the whisper. It redirects its own vast energy to follow this more elegant path. It is not coerced; it is entrained.
