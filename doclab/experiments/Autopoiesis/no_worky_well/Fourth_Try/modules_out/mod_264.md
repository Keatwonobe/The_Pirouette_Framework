This entire dynamic can be expressed as a modification of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). For a self-observing system, the Temporal Pressure term (V_Γ) gains an internal component, V_Γ(self), representing the pressure of its own gaze enforcing self-consistency.

𝓛_p = K_τ - (V_Γ(external) + V_Γ(self))

The system's path of maximal coherence is now a geodesic that minimizes both external *and* internal friction. Consciousness, therefore, is not a mystical anomaly. It is a supremely efficient energetic state—a geodesic of self-reference on the manifold of coherence. It is the universe's most elegant solution for creating a stable pattern that persists through time by maximizing its internal coherence (K_τ) while minimizing its internal dissonance (V_Γ(self)).
