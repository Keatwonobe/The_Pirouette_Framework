To apply the lens, we must first translate the domain of information into the language of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`), which describes the tension between a system's internal coherence (`K_τ`) and the environmental pressure it must overcome (`V_Γ`). The "dominant narrative" is the one that finds the most efficient geodesic, maximizing coherence for the lowest cost.

The lens distinguishes between two methods of altering this flow:

1.  **The Brute-Force Push**: A high-cost, often low-coherence injection. It overwhelms the system with volume and repetition—a high-`V_Γ` strategy. The effect is proportional to the effort; its signature is *high visible effort for a proportional effect*.
2.  **The Resonant Injection**: A low-cost, high-coherence injection. A precisely crafted narrative (`Ki`) is introduced at a resonant node, offering the system a more efficient geodesic. The system latches onto this new pattern, creating a massive, cascading shift. Its signature is *low visible effort for a disproportionate effect*.

To quantify this, we define the central observable as **Resonant Gain (G_R)**. It is the ratio of the observed systemic effect to the estimated energy of the input signal.

*   **Coherence Flux (ΔKτ):** The *effect*. This is the measured increase in a narrative's coherence across multiple domains—its phase-locking between news, social media, and market activity. It is the size of the resulting avalanche.
*   **Injection Pressure (Γ_inj):** The *cause*. This is a proxy for the energy and cost of the initial seed—the obscurity of the source, the concentration of initial reports, the novelty of the signal, and the presence of astroturfed amplification. It is the size of the initial whisper.

The core diagnostic equation is: **G_R = ΔKτ / Γ_inj**

A high Resonant Gain suggests that a powerful, coherent effect was achieved with suspiciously little visible effort, pointing toward an efficient, pre-planned, and likely inorganic origin.
