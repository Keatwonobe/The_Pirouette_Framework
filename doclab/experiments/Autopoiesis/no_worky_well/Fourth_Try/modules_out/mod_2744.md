An entity's TEP is first distributed across five core attributes. These are not passive modifiers but deep reservoirs of potential that define a character's innate capabilities.

Attribute Scaling:

Score: An attribute's Score is equal to half the total EP invested in it, rounded down. Score = floor(EP Invested / 2).

Modifier: An attribute's Modifier is equal to one-quarter of its Score, rounded down. Modifier = floor(Score / 4).

The Five Attributes:

Strength (STR): Governs the application of raw physical power.

Checks: When making a Strength check to overcome a variable force, you roll 1d[STR Score]. The result is the amount of entropy you bring to bear.

Combat: Your STR modifier adds to your physical attacks. For every +1 modifier, you may add an additional die of damage (e.g., a +2 modifier allows you to spend 2 extra EP to turn a 1d8 attack into a 1d10 attack).

Dexterity (DEX): Governs agility, reflexes, and control over the flow of action.

Initiative: At the start of each turn, you may spend a number of EP up to your DEX modifier to shift your position in the initiative order.

Constitution (CON): Governs an entity's connection to the flow of entropy and their physical endurance.

Regeneration: This remains the primary source of an entity's Entropy Regeneration Rate (ERR), as defined in TLE-000.

Intelligence (INT): Governs logic, memory, and the ability to impose complex will upon the world.

Combat Utility: Your INT modifier provides a pool of "free" EP each round that can be spent on any action.

Knowledge: Your INT modifier can be applied as a bonus to the DC of a knowledge-based check. It also serves as a tiebreaker for contested spellcasting checks.

Wisdom (WIS): Governs intuition, perception, and defensive insight.

General Utility: Your WIS modifier provides a pool of "free" EP that can be spent on any skill or ability check outside of combat.
