The final chapter of migration is not arrival, but integration. This process is not a simple "assimilation" but a delicate attempt at an `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012) between the migrant and host populations. A migrant group arrives with its own coherence manifold (`Ki_migrant`), which must interact with that of the host community (`Ki_host`).

*   **The Resonant Handshake:** For successful integration, the two systems must achieve a "resonant handshake." This requires harmonic compatibility (shared values, economic symbiosis) and phase alignment (communication, mutual respect).
*   **Synthesis (Laminar Flow):** If the handshake is successful, the two systems can merge their coherence manifolds to form a new, more complex, and often more resilient socio-cultural entity (`Ki_new`). This is the birth of a vibrant, integrated society, characterized by laminar social flow.
*   **Friction (Turbulent Flow):** If the handshake fails due to extreme dissonance, the result is social friction, ghettoization, and conflict. The two communities fail to synthesize, instead creating a state of perpetual, energy-wasting turbulent flow.
