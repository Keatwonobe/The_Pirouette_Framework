summary: Provides a modernized, time-first protocol for analyzing any network as a
  dynamic coherence manifold. It translates network data into the core Pirouette variables
  and uses spectral analysis via a Coherence Laplacian to diagnose the health of its
  information flows. This module equips the Weaver to act as a systemic physician,
  identifying sources of turbulence and stagnation to restore systemic health.
