An action's impact is not measured by the energy it expends, but by the coherence it invites. A shout into a storm is lost, while a whisper in a silent room can change a life.

By consciously managing the temporal and energetic dynamics of an interaction, a Weaver moves beyond mere communication and into the domain of genuine synthesis.
