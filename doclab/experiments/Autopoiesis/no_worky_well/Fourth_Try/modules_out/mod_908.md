This module introduces the Geodesic Engine, the Pirouette Framework's primary instrument for simulating and engineering the evolution of systems. It is the formal, time-first successor to the legacy "Dimension Box" (PPS-066), replacing its ad-hoc field models with a single, unified dynamic principle: the maximization of coherence.

The engine operationalizes the framework's core law. It posits that all evolution is a form of geodesic searchâ€”a process by which a system discovers its path of maximal coherence through the landscape of spacetime. The engine provides the algorithms to model this search, revealing not just what a system will do, but what it is striving to become. It reframes processes as disparate as learning, cultural assimilation, and genetic inheritance as complementary tactics for solving the same fundamental problem: finding the most resonant state of being.
