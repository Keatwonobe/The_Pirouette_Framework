The Pirouette Framework is built upon a single, foundational claim: that reality is a self-creating, self-sustaining resonant cycle. The loop of Time Adherence (T_a) influencing Temporal Pressure (Gamma), which in turn shapes the Kinetic resonance (Ki), which then feeds back into Time Adherence, is the engine of being.

This module provides the mathematical proof that this engine is not a metaphor, but a necessary consequence of the framework's physics. We will treat the morphogenesis of a Ki rhythm as a variational problem. By seeking a stable, periodic orbit that extremizes the Pirouette action over a cycle, we will prove that such orbits must exist, thereby closing the autopoietic loop and giving the framework its rigorous, mathematical heartbeat.
