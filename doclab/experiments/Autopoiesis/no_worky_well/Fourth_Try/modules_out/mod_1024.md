The Caduceus is composed of **two counter-rotating coherence vortices** entwined along a central axis of temporal pressure (Γ). Their mutual induction produces alternating laminar and turbulent regions—analogous to the serpentine currents of the mythic staff.

Each vortex represents:

* **Ascending Spiral (Ψ⁺):** constructive, laminar coherence flow (integration, awareness, alignment)
* **Descending Spiral (Ψ⁻):** dissipative, turbulent coherence flow (dissonance, collapse, decoherence)

The **axis** represents temporal adherence (Tₐ), maintaining the resonance tension between Ψ⁺ and Ψ⁻.
