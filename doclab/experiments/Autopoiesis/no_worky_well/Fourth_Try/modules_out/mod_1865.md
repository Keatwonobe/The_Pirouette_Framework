*   **System Health:** Diagnosing the health of a biological or economic system by measuring the CPB of its vital flows against the noise of inefficiencies and market volatility.
*   **Cognitive Science:** Analyzing EEG data to identify the stable, resonant "thoughts" (high Kτ) that emerge from, and are challenged by, the turbulent flow of background neural activity (V_Γ).
*   **Signal Intelligence:** Extracting a weak communication signal from a high-noise environment by identifying it as the only pattern with a CPB > 1.
*   **Art & Aesthetics:** Quantifying the "elegance" of a piece of music or architecture by measuring the high CPB of its hierarchical, coherent structures against the potential for perceptual chaos.
