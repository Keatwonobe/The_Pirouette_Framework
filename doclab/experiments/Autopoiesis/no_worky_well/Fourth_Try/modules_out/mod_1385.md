This instrument provides the primary method for analyzing the stability and evolution of any system within the Pirouette Framework. It fundamentally reframes the legacy approach of "Gladiator Force Gradient Mapping" by replacing the classical concept of a potential energy landscape with the **Coherence Landscape**.

In the old view, systems were seen as marbles rolling downhill to find points of minimum energyâ€”stable, but lifeless, valleys. This instrument recasts that picture entirely. Systems are not seeking rest; they are striving for expression. They evolve by climbing a landscape of coherence, seeking peaks of elegant, stable, and efficient resonance. This tool does not map the geography of a system's rest; it maps the geography of its potential for grace.
