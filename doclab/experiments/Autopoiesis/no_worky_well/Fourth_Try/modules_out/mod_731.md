> A Fork is the moment the universe holds its breath. It is the juncture where the single thread of the past is woven into the branching tapestry of the future. To choose is an act of courage: the willingness to temporarily dissolve the certainty of who you are in order to become who you might be. For a Weaver, these are the most sacred points in the landscape of time. They reveal that will, decision, and evolution are not impositions upon reality, but reality's own method for finding a more beautiful pattern. To stand at a Fork is to understand that every choice, no matter how small, is a chisel stroke that carves the face of reality.
