An action is a ripple cast upon the sea of reality. A punch, a spell, a hurried step—all are expenditures of the soul's finite potential. This module provides the grammar for that expenditure. It defines the cost of a warrior’s fury, the reach of a wizard’s ambition, and the price of a body’s endurance. Through these rules, the abstract concept of will is forged into the concrete, tactical art of existence.
