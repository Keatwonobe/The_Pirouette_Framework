We have built a classical cathedral, its arches following the elegant lines of the Lagrangian. Now, we have breathed life into the stone. The act of quantization transforms our deterministic machine into a living symphony of probabilities. It is the step that allows the framework to speak of not just the path that is, but of all paths that could be, providing the rigorous and necessary language to finally describe the universe's quantum song. The toolkit is forged. The calculation awaits.
