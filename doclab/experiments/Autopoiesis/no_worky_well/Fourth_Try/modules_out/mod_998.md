**Hypothesis:** A folded protein's structure is a stable Ki pattern—a geometric solution that maximizes its internal coherence (K_τ) against the intense and chaotic temporal pressure (V_Γ) of the cellular environment.

**Finding:** An analysis of over one million proteins reveals their fractal dimensions are not randomly distributed, but cluster around the framework's predicted modes of maximal stability. Evolution has repeatedly and independently discovered the same set of maximally coherent geometric solutions to sustain the dance of life.

**Lagrangian Connection:** A living cell is a direct, ongoing expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. Proteins are a prime example of a system evolving an optimal K_τ to survive, function, and persist within a high V_Γ environment.
