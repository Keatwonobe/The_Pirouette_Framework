This document is a catalog of the strange, dangerous, and unique creatures that inhabit the entropic landscape of the bottom realm. Each entry provides a mechanical stat block and tactical notes for the Game Master.

- Wheat-Wolf (Hungry Scavenger)
A wolf-hog hybrid with a stocky, powerful body covered in shaggy, wheat-colored fur. Its eyes glow with a feral red light, and sharp, carnivorous tusks jut from its maw. They are relentless pack hunters that stalk the endless fields of the August Jag.

Total Entropy Pool (TEP): 35 EP

DEX: 2 EP (Score 1, Mod +0)

CON: 1 EP (Score 0, Mod +0)

INT: 0 EP (Score 0, Mod +0)

Standard Limbs (Legs, x4): 24 EP (6 EP each)

Senses (Eyes x2, Scent Organ x1): 3 EP

Max HP: 1 + floor(0.5 * 24) = 13 HP

Movement: 60 feet (Two pairs of Standard Limbs)

Skills & Feats: None

Actions:

Tusk Gore: Melee Attack. Spends Size Entropy from its Head to deal damage.

Tactics: Wheat-wolves are simple pack hunters. They use their superior speed to surround a target, and then the pack alpha will charge in to make the first attack. They are not tactically brilliant and will fight until slain or until their alpha is killed, at which point the rest of the pack will flee.

Residue: Tusks, Pelt, Heart (Low-value Residue).

- Nomad Bandit (Template)
The wastes are home to nomadic camps that shadow the great walking cities. These "second cities" are a haven for criminals, scavengers, and those who cannot or will not live by the strict rules of the city-states. Bandits from these camps are survivors, more interested in a quick score than a fair fight.

Total Entropy Pool (TEP): 50 EP (Bandit Thug)

Archetype (Roll 1d6):

Juggernaut: High STR, focuses on intimidation and heavy melee.

Arcanist: A desperate hedge-mage with one damaging elemental skill.

Phantom: A classic rogue with high DEX and a "Subterfuge" skill pool.

Weaver: A "blood-sculptor" who uses their art to inflict minor wounds.

Sentinel: Wears scavenged armor and uses a makeshift shield.

Drifter: A nimble skirmisher who uses dirty tricks to create difficult terrain.

Attributes, Form, & Skills: Distribute the 50 TEP according to the rolled archetype. Most will have a standard Humanoid form (18 EP).

Tactics: Bandits are opportunists. They will try to ambush their targets and use their numbers to their advantage. They are not zealots; a bandit reduced to half their HP will almost always attempt to flee or surrender. Their goal is to steal TEP (in the form of trophies) or valuable barter items, not to die for a cause.

Residue: Scavenged gear, a single trophy representing their primary skill (e.g., a spell focus, a lockpick, a blood-stained rag).

- Hole Hag
A terrifying shade born of the countless bodies buried unceremoniously beneath the wheat fields. It appears as a gaunt, shadowy form with long, grasping arms made of compacted soil and root. It does not wish to kill, but to drag the living down into the suffocating darkness from which it came.

Total Entropy Pool (TEP): 95 EP

Senses (Resonant Sense): 1 EP

Utility Limb (Burrowing Form): 4 EP

Max HP: 1 + floor(0.5 * 6) = 4 HP

Skills & Feats (40 EP):

Skill Pool: "Subterfuge": 30 EP (Used for its initial stealth)

Feat: Gloom-Sight (8 EP)

Feat: Kinetic Conversion (2 EP from CON)

Abilities:

Burrow: The Hole Hag can move through earth and soil as if it were open air. It cannot be targeted unless it is on the surface or something has burrowed to touch range.

Grave Grasp: Melee Attack. On a hit, the target is grappled. The Hole Hag can then use its action on subsequent turns to drag the grappled victim 5 feet underground. A creature dragged underground is considered Smothered.

Tactics: The Hole Hag is an ambush predator. It will lie in wait, using its Subterfuge pool to remain hidden. When a target passes over it, it will erupt from the ground and attempt to use Grave Grasp. If it successfully grabs a victim, it will immediately disappear back underground, dragging its prey with it. The only way to fight it effectively is to have a prepared action to strike the moment it appears.

Residue: A heart of compacted, grave-soiled earth (Uncommon Residue).
