This dual-dividend structure reveals a profound truth about strategy. A "selfish" act, defined as one that seeks to maximize its own `K_τ` by externalizing cost and thus increasing the ambient `V_Γ` for others, is a fool's bargain. It is like shouting in a library to better hear the sound of one's own voice; a momentary, local victory is achieved by making the entire environment hostile to the desired activity. It is a strategy doomed to a low, local maximum.

The only path to a global maximum of coherence—to unbounded growth and resilience—is through **Resonant Altruism**. This is the strategy of seeking actions that maximize *both* the internal and external dividends simultaneously. It is the recognition that the most effective way to strengthen oneself is to strengthen the system in which one is embedded. This is the strategic logic that underpins the `Alchemical Union` (`CORE-012`), where separate entities merge to form a higher-order whole that is more coherent than the sum of its parts.

Altruism, in this light, is not an act of self-sacrifice. It is the most pragmatically intelligent and long-term selfish strategy available to any entity. It is intelligent environmental engineering.
