The value of `n` in the phase term is not arbitrary. Its most profound constraint comes from `CORE-002: The Nomad's Grammar`. Any stable entity must be describable by its posture along the three fundamental axes of behavior: Vector, Cohesion, and Communion. These axes are not independent; they form a coupled system whose geometry dictates the stable "corners" of existence.

The `n=3` symmetry is therefore revealed to have a clear physical origin: it is the triaxial nature of being. The phase-locking potential `V_φ` is not about a single abstract phase angle, but about the relative phases between the system's expression on these three axes. This creates a "triple-well" potential, not in abstract space, but in the behavioral space of the Nomad's Grammar. This potential drives systems away from states of internal contradiction and towards archetypal, coherent states of being—the stable "soft-lock minima" that represent effective survival strategies.
