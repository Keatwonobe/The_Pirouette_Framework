A union is not a collision. Brute force creates fragments; true synthesis requires elegance, timing, and harmony. Two systems cannot merge their being unless they first engage in a Resonant Handshake. This is the process by which their echoes begin to constructively interfere, preparing their coherence manifolds for a shared existence.

The conditions for this handshake are precise:

Harmonic Compatibility: The fundamental Ki patterns of the two entities must be harmonically related. They need not be identical, but like notes in a musical chord, their frequencies must form a stable, non-dissonant ratio. An electron and a proton can find this harmony; two protons, by their nature, repel.

Phase Alignment: The resonant cycles of the two entities must approach a state of phase-lock. Two perfectly harmonic guitar strings, plucked out of phase, will produce a discordant, wavering sound. To unify, their rhythms must align, their proverbial downbeats must match.

Sufficient Î“ (Pressure): The ambient Temporal Pressure must be high enough to overcome the inertia of each entity's individual Wound Channel (CORE-011). This pressure acts as a catalyst, a necessary confinement that forces the two systems to "solve for" a shared state of higher coherence rather than remaining separate.
