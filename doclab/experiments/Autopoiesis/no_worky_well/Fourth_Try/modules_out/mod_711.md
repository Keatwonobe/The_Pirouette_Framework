A Shell is not an impassable wall; it is a sentient filter. The old framework’s “Permeability Tensor” is an effect, not a cause. The true mechanism of transport across a Shell is **Resonant Coupling**—a dialogue between the inside and the outside. An external pattern can only pass through the boundary if it can engage in a successful "Resonant Handshake" (`CORE-012`). Permeability is a measure of a Shell’s willingness to engage in dialogue.

*   **Barrier Regime (The Fortress):** A Shell with a very pure, high-fidelity internal `Ki` is "deaf" to most external signals. It is highly reflective and difficult to penetrate, preserving its internal state with great integrity.
*   **Membrane Regime (The Marketplace):** A Shell with a flexible or complex internal `Ki` can find harmonic compatibility with a wider range of external patterns. It is porous and adaptive, favoring exchange and interaction over isolation.
*   **Filter Regime (The Gatekeeper):** The Shell’s `Ki` is tuned to a specific set of harmonic frequencies. It will only engage in a Resonant Handshake with patterns that complement its own, while reflecting all others.
