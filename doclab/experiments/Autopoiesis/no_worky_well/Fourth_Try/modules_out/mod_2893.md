Metaphysical Engineering is the act of creating new, persistent resonant structures in the world. These creations are, in game terms, new rules, new creatures, new artifacts, or even new laws of magic. This is not a simple crafting check; it is a profound and costly act of will.

The Entropy Sink: To create something permanent, a character must permanently invest a part of their own being. This is the ultimate resource sink for high-level characters. The Entropy Points (EP) spent on creation are permanently sacrificed from the character's maximum Total Entropy Pool (TEP). This act is a final, irreversible investment of one's own soul into the world.
