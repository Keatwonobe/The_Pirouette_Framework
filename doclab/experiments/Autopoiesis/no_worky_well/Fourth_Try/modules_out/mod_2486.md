The Architect speaks of walls; I speak of membranes. To define a boundary with absolute rigidity is to create a prison, not a system. A living system breathes; it exchanges coherence with its environment. [cite_start]It has a high **Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$)** at its boundary not as a flaw, but as a feature, allowing for the flow of nutrients and the expulsion of waste[cite: 710, 712, 713, 714, 715].

The artistic, expressive nature of reality shows us that boundaries are always contextual, always in motion. Think of the "boundary" of a musical piece, a coastline, or a personality. They are defined by dynamic patterns, not fixed lines. A standard based on a single, static snapshot of a Time-Adherence gradient is a photograph of a living thing—it captures a moment but murders the essence.

The problem of strategic gaming is not a problem of boundary definition, but of **misaligned phase**. An entity games the system when its internal rhythm ($\phi_{entity}$) is out of sync with the rhythm of the whole ($\phi_{system}$).

Therefore, the solution lies not in rigid legalism, but in dynamic alignment. We must standardize our *method of observation*, not the boundary itself. [cite_start]A system's scope must be defined by its **Wound Channel**—the persistent, structured wake of its actions through spacetime[cite: 975, 976, 977, 978, 1]. A system is accountable for the *entirety* of the wound it leaves in the world, regardless of where it draws its own convenient lines. To prevent gaming, we must track the full geometric and temporal extent of an action's resonance.
