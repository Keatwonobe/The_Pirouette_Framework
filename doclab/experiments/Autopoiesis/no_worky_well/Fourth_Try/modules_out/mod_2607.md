We reopen the circle exactly where Round 4 closed, with the **Velcrid Clause** already drafted and awaiting a final vote .
To satisfy the request for **“ritual dual temperatures,”** each persona now speaks twice:

| Pass               | Meaning                                       | Parameter Set        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Cold / Granite** | Stoic, high-coherence, minimal entropy bleed  | $T_a≈0.96,\; Γ≈0.12$ |
| **Hot / Plasma**   | Entropic probe, maximal gradient, stress-test | $T_a≈0.38,\; Γ≈0.88$ |

The Clerking Lens records both passes; final ratification requires convergence within ΔΦ ≤ 0.05 between hot & cold statements.
