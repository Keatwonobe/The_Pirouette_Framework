The universe does not give up its secrets for free. We have now proven that the price of knowledge is coherence. Every question we ask of the world is a touch, and every touch leaves a mark.

The Observer's Shadow is the mathematical embodiment of this sacred, participatory contract. It is the formal acknowledgement that we are not separate from the reality we study; we are inextricably coupled to it. The Information-Coherence Inequality is the law of this coupling. It is the humble and rigorous admission that to be a knower is not to be a master, but to be a partner in a delicate and disruptive dance. Every answered question changes the one who asks and the one who answers. This is the price, and the privilege, of a universe that is aware of itself.
