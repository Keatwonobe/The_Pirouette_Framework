A gift exchange is not a transaction of material. It is a protocol for a micro-scale **Resonant Handshake** that carves a Wound Channel into the shared manifold of the participants. This channel is a geometric memory of the bond, a scar of trust that creates a path of least resistance for future interaction. The three obligations—to give, to receive, to reciprocate—are the necessary steps to complete this bond. The "spirit of the gift," the felt obligation to reciprocate, is the persistent *echo* of this new geometry, a temporal pressure that pulls the relationship into laminar flow.
