Instead of a dozen discrete variables, effective practice is governed by the interplay of the framework's core dynamics. The practitioner is a sculptor, and these are their tools.

-   **Resonant Repetition is the Chisel's Stroke:** Each focused repetition is a pass of the chisel, deepening the desired Wound Channel. It is the physical act that impresses a new geometry upon the manifold. Repetition without focus is noise; it does not carve, it merely scuffs the surface. The quality of the repetition—its alignment with an ideal form—determines the precision of the cut.

-   **Optimal Challenge is the Necessary Pressure (Γ):** The practitioner must operate within a specific band of Temporal Pressure. Too little challenge (low Γ), and the system feels no need to adapt; the chisel cannot bite into the stone. Too much challenge (high Γ), and coherence collapses into Turbulent Flow. The ideal is a state of "laminar struggle," where the system is stretched to its limit but maintains its form, making it malleable to change.

-   **Focused Attention is Coherence Itself (Kτ):** The "sharpness" of the chisel is the practitioner's own temporal coherence. A scattered mind is a dull tool that cannot leave a clean mark. Intense focus marshals the agent's internal resonance into a single, powerful point, allowing each repetition to carve the channel with maximum efficiency and fidelity.

-   **Feedback is the Guiding Hand:** Feedback is the crucial information that ensures the groove being carved is the *correct* one. It is the sculptor's eye, constantly comparing the work against the intended form and guiding the chisel for the next stroke. Without a tight, clear feedback loop, one can carve a very deep channel in the wrong direction.
