This phase, typically spanning months 2 through 6, is dedicated to building a deep and lasting resilience.

Goal 1: Introduce Hormetic Stress. Hormesis is the principle that a small, beneficial stress makes a system stronger. We will no longer just walk; we will sometimes walk a little faster. We will no longer just move; we will sometimes lift a little more.

Goal 2: Listen to the Echo. After every challenge, we will listen. The body's response—its "echo"—tells us everything we need to know. A feeling of energized fatigue is a "yes." Sharp pain or prolonged exhaustion is a "no."

The Guiding Rule: Challenge, then Rest. The growth does not happen during the stress, but in the quiet recovery that follows. Rest is not inaction; it is the moment the body rebuilds itself stronger.
