The Entropy Ledger is the accounting system for the **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)**. The principle states that a system follows the path that maximizes its "action," `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`.

A system in perfect **Laminar Flow** is successfully tracking this ideal path (`S_actual ≈ S_ideal`). Its actions are elegant, its Coherence Cost is minimal, and its entry in the Entropy Ledger is clean.

**Turbulent Flow**, by definition, is a deviation from this geodesic. The system is failing to maximize its coherence (`S_actual < S_ideal`). The Coherence Cost, `Ṡ_local`, is the direct, measurable price of that failure. The ledger, therefore, is not just a record of waste; it is a log of a system's deviation from the universe's most fundamental law, proportional to the action squandered on inelegant motion.

`Coherence Cost ∝ (S_ideal - S_actual)`
