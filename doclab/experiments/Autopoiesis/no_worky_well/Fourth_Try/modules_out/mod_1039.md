A system suffering from an unknown ailment presents a disconnected plotâ€”a collection of clues, dissonant effects, and a chaotic `Wound Channel`. The Daedalus Gambit mandates that we give this plot a provisional antagonist. This is not a vague "disease," but a specific, dissonant `Ki` (resonant signature) with a characteristic persona. By personifying the pathology, we create a coherent character whose methods, motivations, and weaknesses can be logically investigated. This transforms a mystery into a puzzle, and a puzzle, unlike a mystery, has a solution.
