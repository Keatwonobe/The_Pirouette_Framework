This protocol is a direct, practical application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. A Resonant Act works by engineering a clear geodesic—a path of least resistance—for an idea to travel.

1.  **Arena Sculpting** dramatically lowers the "cost" of change by decreasing the local potential of Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`).
2.  **The Offering** presents a state of high internal coherence (`K_τ`) that is more stable and elegant than the recipient's current state.

By altering the landscape of coherence in this way, the action makes it metabolically "cheaper" for the recipient to integrate the new pattern than to resist it. The feeling of a sudden, effortless insight—an "aha!" moment—is the subjective experience of one's own mind following this perfectly laid geodesic to a new, more stable state of understanding.
