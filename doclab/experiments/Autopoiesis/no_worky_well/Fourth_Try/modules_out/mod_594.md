A healthy system flows. An unhealthy system fails. This module provides the grammar for that failure and its counterpart, renewal. It moves beyond a simple binary of "working" or "broken" to define the four fundamental, universal pathways by which any coherent system evolves.

This module replaces the static "Reality Funnel" of PPS-026 with a more dynamic, time-first concept: the **geodesic of maximal coherence**. This geodesic is the optimal path a system traces as it follows the Pirouette Lagrangian—the invisible riverbed of its own health. The four pathways—Lock, Fracture, Drift, and Rebound—are not arbitrary events, but specific, predictable deviations from this path. To understand them is to move from being a victim of chaos to a diagnostician of its underlying geometry.
