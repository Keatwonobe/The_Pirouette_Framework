The system's drive to maximize coherence results in one of three possible outcomes when it encounters a perturbation in Î“. These replace the old, complex resolution paths.

*   **Dampen (The Path of Stability):** The system treats the external pressure as noise. It tightens its own resonance, reinforcing its **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) and dissipating the perturbation. This is the act of maintaining identity against chaos, of saying "no." The river stone holds its shape as water flows past.

*   **Synchronize (The Path of Growth):** The system finds harmonic compatibility with the new pressure. It performs an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012), allowing its own Ki to be altered. Its internal geometry is reforged into a new, more complex, and more coherent state. This is the act of learning and evolution, of saying "yes." The river carves a new, more elegant path through the landscape.

*   **Isolate (The Path of Stress):** The system can neither dampen nor synchronize with the pressure. The dissonance is too great to ignore but too alien to integrate. The system walls off the dissonant pattern to prevent systemic collapse, entering a state of high internal stress. This is the formation of a trauma, a paradox, a "frozen" module. The river forms a stagnant pool behind a dam it cannot break.
