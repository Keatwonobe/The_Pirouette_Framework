The experimental apparatus is a Mach-Zehnder neutron interferometer, a device repurposed to offer a single quantum system a choice between two distinct geometric landscapes.

**The Labyrinth Walls:** In each arm of the interferometer, we place a micro-fabricated helical silicon grating. In the old language, this created a "spiral potential." In the new, time-first framework, this grating is a **Γ-sculptor** or **Topological Modulator**. It impresses a stable, chiral (screw-like) stress upon the local Temporal Pressure (Γ), forging a predictable, structured coherence manifold.

**The Two Paths:** The neutron's wavefunction (its Ki resonance) is presented with two distinct topological challenges:
*   **Path A:** A left-handed helical manifold.
*   **Path B:** A right-handed helical manifold.

The neutron does not split. Its resonance explores both chiral landscapes simultaneously to find the most coherent path forward. The two arms of the interferometer are two different questions asked of the same particle.
