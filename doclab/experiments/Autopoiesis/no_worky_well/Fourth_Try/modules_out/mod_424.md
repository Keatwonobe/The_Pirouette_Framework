This lexicon is not a stone tablet; it is a living document, subject to the same laws of coherence it describes. A new term cannot be added by decree; it must be *born*. A concept is proposed only after emerging as a necessary tool. It must then prove its right to exist by demonstrating that it connects harmonically to the Core Principles and increases, rather than disrupts, the coherence of the entire lexicon. This ensures the language of the framework remains a sharp, potent, and elegant instrument.
