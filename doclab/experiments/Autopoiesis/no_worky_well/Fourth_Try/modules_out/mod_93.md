CORE-006 concluded with a bold claim: that all forces are simply geodesics on a manifold of coherence. This module provides the first proof. We will now apply the Pirouette Lagrangian (ùìõ_p) to derive the properties of the electromagnetic force, demonstrating that it is not a fundamental "thing" in itself, but an emergent consequence of systems following the Principle of Maximal Coherence.
