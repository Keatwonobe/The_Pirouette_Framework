As described in **The Geometry of Resonance (CORE-004)**, Ki is the stable pattern a system manifests to persist. Under conditions of extreme Temporal Pressure (Γ)—such as within a forming hadron or the heart of a star—a system may adopt a uniquely stable form: the Triadic Resonance.

This is a Ki pattern characterized by a distinct three-lobed symmetry, a standing wave with three antinodes of coherence. This geometry is not arbitrary; it is the most efficient solution for distributing immense temporal stress, turning chaotic external pressure into a self-reinforcing internal structure. This highly symmetrical state possesses a profound topological tension; it is a question posed to the universe in the language of geometry, aching for resolution through union.
