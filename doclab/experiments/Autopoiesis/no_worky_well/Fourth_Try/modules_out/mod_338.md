This lexicon is not an abstraction layered on top of the framework's physics; it is a direct expression of it. The Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, is the mathematical engine that drives a system to adopt the coherence mode that yields the highest internal coherence (`K_τ`) for the lowest environmental cost (`V_Γ`).

-   A system in a **pure mode** like **Rest** or **Bind** has found a deep, local minimum in the potential landscape (`V_Γ`), maximizing its stability and temporal coherence (`K_τ`).
-   A system in **Motion** is following a geodesic—a path of maximal coherence—through the manifold.
-   A system in **superposition** has a complex and fluctuating `K_τ`, representing the interference of its constituent modes. It follows a more chaotic path until it finds and settles into a pure mode that maximizes the value of its Lagrangian.

The "choice" of an action is not a metaphysical event, but the system settling into the most energetically favorable geometric configuration available to it. Action is the universe's relentless search for the most elegant word.
