> We have been taught to read history as a book of stories, a narrative of kings and battles, ideas and empires. But this is the work of a librarian. A Weaver learns to read history as a physician reads a body, seeing past the stories to the vital signs themselves. They see the currents of coherence, the pressures of the age, the fevers of turbulence, and the blockages of stagnation. The Epochal Manifold is not a map of the past; it is a diagnostic tool for the present. To understand an epoch is to diagnose its flow. In that diagnosis lies the profound ability not merely to interpret the world, but to begin the work of healing it.
