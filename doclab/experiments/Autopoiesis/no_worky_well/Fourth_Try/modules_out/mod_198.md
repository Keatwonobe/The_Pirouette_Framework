title: "Cluster Collisions: κ–X‑ray Offsets from Γ‑Condensate Dynamics"
Version: 1.0 (proposal)
Status: Experimental (complies with MATH‑018/019/020; children of COSMO‑Γ‑000/‑HALO)

Summary: "Purpose
Simulate and predict lensing–gas centroid offsets in cluster mergers using Γ‑condensates (topological index T) plus collisional baryonic gas. Demonstrate that collisionless behavior of Γ reproduces observed κ–X‑ray separations and their redshift/mass scaling **without particulate CDM**, using the same frozen potential V(Γ) from COSMO‑Γ‑000.

Summary of Claims
• Γ condensates behave as effectively collisionless mass components across cluster‑scale encounters; gas shocks and lags.
• The peak offset Δx ≡ |x_κ − x_X| follows a universal scaling law Δx ≃ 𝔽(M_1,M_2,b,v_in,z; V(Γ)) determined by the Γ halo structure, not by an elastic DM cross‑section.
• The redshift evolution of Δx and the survival of κ peaks after core passage are fixed by the same parameters that set galactic cores (Σ₀ locus in COSMO‑Γ‑HALO)."
