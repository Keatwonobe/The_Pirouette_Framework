summary: Provides a time-first model for human migration, reframing it from a simple
  push-pull dynamic to a population's search for maximal coherence along a geodesic.
  Migration is modeled as a flow across a dynamic 'Landscape of Belonging', shaped
  by temporal pressures and the promise of stable resonance.
