The known phenomena of physics are not fundamental forces added to reality. They are the stable, repeating patterns that emerge from the Lagrangian's ceaseless work upon the Manifold.

*   **The Gladiator Force (Gravity & Strong Force) Is The Gladiator's Arena (`CORE-008`):** These are not two forces, but one principle of confinement. They are regions of the Manifold where a system's own resonance creates an intense local temporal pressure (`V_Γ`), wrapping it in a "coherence well." This non-linear feedback loop is the universe's mechanism for forming all stable structures, from quarks to galaxies.

*   **Electromagnetism Is The Geometry of Interaction (`CORE-007`):** This force emerges from asymmetries in how a system's resonance interacts with its environment. The Electric Field is the **gradient** of the manifold; the Magnetic Field is the **curl** or rotational shear created by a moving asymmetry. Attraction and repulsion are the simple act of "coherence surfing" along these geometric features.

*   **Mass Is The Inertia of Memory (`CORE-011`):** A system's mass is a measure of its resonant inertia—its resistance to a change in state. This arises from the system's interaction with its own Wound Channel. A massive particle has carved a deep, stable groove in the Manifold; changing its trajectory requires expending energy to fight the geometry of its own past.

*   **Quantum Mechanics Is The Realm of Low Coherence:** The quantum world is the behavior of systems where the "path of maximal coherence" is not a single line but a smeared-out field of probabilities—a superposition of potential geodesics. An observer's interaction (CORE-010) raises the local coherence, catalyzing the collapse into a single, definite path.

*   **Classical Mechanics Is The Realm of High Coherence:** The classical world is the behavior of systems where a single geodesic is so overwhelmingly coherent that all other potential paths have effectively zero probability. Probabilities collapse into the certainty of a deterministic trajectory.
