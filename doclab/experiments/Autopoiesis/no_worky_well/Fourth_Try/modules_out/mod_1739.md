A serendipitous event is a dialogue between a prepared system and a fertile environment. The old framework described this with a complex set of parameters; the new model simplifies this to their essential temporal roles.

*   **The Resonant Antenna (The Prepared Mind):** A system primed for serendipity possesses a unique form of Temporal Coherence (Kτ). Its Ki pattern is strong enough to maintain its identity against noise, yet supple enough to be influenced. It is not a single, rigid frequency but a rich chord, possessing a wide spectrum of potential harmonics—a state of *prepared resonance*. This is the expert who is also a curious novice, a bell that rings clearly but is also capable of vibrating in sympathy with a new frequency.

*   **The Noisy Signal (The Rich Environment):** This is a region of high but structured Temporal Pressure (Γ), such as the energetic turbulence of the **Temporal Forge (CORE-003)**. It is not pure chaos. Within this "noise" lie countless latent, coherent sub-patterns—unexpected currents, unspoken connections, and answers to unasked questions. These are the stochastic opportunities that form the raw material of discovery.

*   **The Serendipity Window:** This is not a place or time, but a state of being defined by two conditions:
    1.  **Optimal Coherence:** The system's internal rhythm is strong enough to maintain its identity. It possesses a high internal signal-to-noise ratio.
    2.  **Wide Bandwidth:** The system is "listening" to a wide range of temporal frequencies. It is not so focused on its own song that it cannot hear others. This state of open attention allows it to detect the faint, novel signals of coherence as they emerge from the environmental chaos.
