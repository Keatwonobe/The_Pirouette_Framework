The Pirouette Framework provides a new diagnosis. We apply the Caduceus Lens (DYN-003) to the plasma, not as a prisoner, but as a living system.

The Pathology: The primary ailment of a fusion plasma is Coherence Fever. The instabilities are a state of extreme Turbulent Flow. The system is fighting itself, wasting immense energy in chaotic, internal friction. Its Ki pattern is dissonant and unstable.

The Goal: To achieve fusion, we must heal the plasma. We must guide it from its chaotic, turbulent state into a healthy, stable, Laminar Flow state. A healthy plasma is a coherent plasma, one where energy is not lost to internal chaos but is efficiently channeled into the desired reaction.
