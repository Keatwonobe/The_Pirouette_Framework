The decision to proceed is not a guess; it is a calculation. The feedback from the Scout Probe provides the variables for the Seed to model its future using a specialized form of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`)** from CORE-006. The "action" to be maximized is the Seed's own long-term coherence.

`𝓛_seed = K_τ(potential) - V_Γ(cost)`

-   **Coherence Potential (`K_τ(potential)`):** This "kinetic" term represents the Seed's potential for growth. It is a function of its own internal Temporal Coherence (`T_a`) multiplied by the Harmonic Compatibility and Geodesic Availability of the environment. A harmonious environment offers resonant resources that can be integrated, amplifying the Seed's pattern. This replaces the old concept of "capture efficiency."

-   **Environmental Cost (`V_Γ(cost)`):** This "potential" term represents the inevitable erosion and the energetic tax the environment will levy on the Seed's existence. It is a direct measure of the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). This replaces the old concept of "feedback gain."

The integral of this Lagrangian over a characteristic cycle determines the **Coherence Gain (`S_p`)**. This single, predictive metric dictates the verdict.
