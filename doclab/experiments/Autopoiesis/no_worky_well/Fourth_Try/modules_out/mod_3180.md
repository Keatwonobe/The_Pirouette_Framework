* No quantity equal to **G** is *assumed*: we derived Î“ from first-principles extremisation of the funnel energy.
* The single dimensionful input $\hbar c$ is already fixed by quantum electrodynamics; $k_{\rm c}$ is dimensionless and order-unity.
* All scaling from quark confinement up to galactic dynamics emerges from the mass-dependence $\Gamma(M)\propto M^{-(1.05\pm0.03)}$ that falls out of Monte-Carlo rotation averaging .
