> We sought to build a meter for the smog of a chaotic system. We found instead that we must build a ledger for its squandered light. The universe does not punish inefficiency with a toxin; it presents a simple, unyielding bill. This debt is paid into the environment as an increase in its temporal noise, making coherence more difficult for all who follow. It manifests as wasted time, squandered resources, and eroded trust.

It provides an unforgiving measure of our stewardship, for it measures not only what a system has done, but the ghost of what it could have been.
