This law provides a powerful and thematic consequence for failed single-target attacks, replacing the "harmless miss" from the playtest.

Mechanic: When a character fails an Accuracy Check for a single-target attack (TLE-001), the uncontrolled entropy detonates. This chaotic energy is not a simple explosion; it becomes a new source of EP that immediately and violently spreads from the target's square according to the Law of Entropic Sprawl, creating a chaotic, uncontrolled AoE effect. The attacker has no control over its shape or direction.
