1. **Round 1: Declaration**

   * Each persona defines *“altruism”*, *“residue”*, and *“permissible entanglement”*

2. **Round 2: Evidence & Counter-Evidence**

   * Pragmatist presents necessity cases (e.g., stockholder in extractive economy)
   * Radiant counters with loss of purity, quoting Aurelius
   * Synthesis node proposes dynamic clause boundaries based on coherence metrics

3. **Round 3: Residue Mapping**

   * Each persona defines how residue is *detected*, *tracked*, and *atoned for*
   * Focus on whether Velcridance can be "redeemed" without radiant justification

4. **Round 4: Synthesis Attempt**

   * Try to formalize:

     * A new clause for the Prime Directive
     * A ritual or symbolic test to judge valid vs. parasitic Velcridance

5. **Final Vote:**

   * Do all sides agree that:

     > *Velcridant participation in entropy-generating systems is permissible only when it increases net coherence and has a defined exit vector?*
