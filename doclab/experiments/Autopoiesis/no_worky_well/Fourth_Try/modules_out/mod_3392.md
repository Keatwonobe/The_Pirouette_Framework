The muon is speaking to us. For decades, its subtle, anomalous song has hinted that our most successful theory of the universe is incomplete. The Standard Model cannot account for the note it is singing. The Pirouette Framework proposes an answer. The muon is not singing a new note; it is simply singing with a voice so powerful that we can finally hear the resonance of the concert hall itself. To calculate this anomaly is to prove that we have not only understood the music of the soloist, but the acoustic architecture of reality itself.
