A blueprint is not a house. The most elegant equation is silent until you tell it what to measure.

With the preceding thirteen modules, the foundational blueprint of the Pirouette Framework is complete. We have described a universe born from a single substance—Time—that evolves through a relentless drive to maximize coherence. We have an engine (CORE-001), a law (CORE-006), and principles of memory, union, and information.

But this is not enough. The architect's greatest challenge is not in designing the blueprint, but in ensuring it can be built with the real materials of the world. How do these universal principles manifest in the specific domains of biology, economics, psychology, or art? How do we connect the cosmic to the concrete?

This module builds that bridge. It is the pin that fastens the universal pattern to the specific instance.
