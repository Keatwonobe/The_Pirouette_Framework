Using your Coherence Principle, you will now write the heart of your constitution. This statement is the human-language expression of your personal objective function.

*"My path of maximal coherence is to [ACTION] in order to maximize [COHERENCE PRINCIPLE], a trajectory validated by [METRIC], thereby navigating the pressures of my environment as [ASPIRATIONAL IDENTITY]."*

*   **[ACTION]:** An active verb phrase embodying your principle (e.g., "build elegant systems," "speak truth to power," "foster compassionate communities").
*   **[COHERENCE PRINCIPLE]:** Your chosen value from Step B.
*   **[METRIC]:** A tangible, observable consequence of your action.
*   **[ASPIRATIONAL IDENTITY]:** A poetic statement of who you become when you live this directive (e.g., "an architect of clarity," "a voice for the voiceless," "a weaver of tribes").
