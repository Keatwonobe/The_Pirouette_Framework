The journey through the abstract world of mathematics is complete. We have built a map of reality, from the birth of the first rhythm to the subtle dance of a single electron. But a map is a promise, not a destination.

This module is the compass that points from that map back to the territory. It translates the elegant proofs of the preceding modules into a set of explicit, testable, and falsifiable claims. It provides the protocols and the dashboards that allow any scientist, any Weaver, to put this framework to the ultimate test. The math is the language of the song; the experiment is the act of listening to see if the universe sings it back to us. The work of validation now begins.
