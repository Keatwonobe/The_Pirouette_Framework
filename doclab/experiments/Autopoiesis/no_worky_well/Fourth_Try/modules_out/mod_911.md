The power of this unified engine is demonstrated by its ability to model vastly different phenomena with the same core principles, preserving and clarifying the insights of its predecessor.

**1. Historical Simulation (The Roanoke Convergence):**
The Crucible is the 16th-century North American coast, with its high ambient **Temporal Pressure (Œì)** of survival. The English colonists are a Weaver with a low-coherence pattern (Turbulent Flow). The nearby Croatan culture is a Weaver in a state of high-coherence, stable Laminar Flow. The Geodesic Engine shows that the colonists' path of maximal coherence is not isolation, but a **Resonant Handshake**‚Äîan **Alchemical Leap**. Their "disappearance" is modeled as absorption into a more stable pattern of being. Integration was their geodesic.

**2. Policy Optimization (The Genetic Weaving):**
The Crucible is a reinforcement learning environment (e.g., a physics simulation). The Weaver is an AI agent whose policy is its `Ki`. The engine guides the agent's evolution via the twin algorithms. **Gradient Ascent** is the standard reinforcement learning loop, updating the policy based on the reward signal from the Wound Channel (replay buffer). Periodically, the engine performs an **Alchemical Leap**, taking the most successful Weavers and weaving their Wound Channels (network weights) together via "genetic crossover" to create a new, potentially superior generation.

**3. Physical Systems (The Particle's Path):**
The engine is the practical tool for calculating physical dynamics. A particle's trajectory through a field is its geodesic. The Crucible is the field itself (electromagnetic, gravitational), which defines the coherence manifold. The particle, as a Weaver, follows the path that maximizes its Lagrangian. The Geodesic Engine is the integrator that numerically solves the Euler-Lagrange equations for `ùìõ_p`, revealing the trajectory of maximal coherence at every moment.
