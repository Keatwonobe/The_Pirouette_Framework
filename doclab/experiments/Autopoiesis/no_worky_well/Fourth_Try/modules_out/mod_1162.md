A system does not break all at once; it first whispers its distress. Before every crash, every bifurcation, every sudden shift, there are subtle precursors of instability. This module provides the instrumentation to hear those whispers. The Coherence Inflection Sentinel is a universal early-warning system designed to detect the subtle decay in a system's internal rhythm that precedes a major systemic state change, or *Ki Morphogenesis* event.

By analyzing the micro-dynamics of a system's resonant pattern (`Ki`), the Sentinel detects the "temporal jitter" that signals a struggle for stability. This provides a crucial lead timeâ€”an opportunity to intervene, mitigate, or adapt before a brewing crisis becomes an overt catastrophe. It moves the Weaver from a reactive posture to a predictive one, transforming diagnosis into the science of foresight.
