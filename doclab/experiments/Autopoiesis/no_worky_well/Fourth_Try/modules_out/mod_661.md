> We believed that time was a river that carried us, slowing in the deeps and quickening in the shallows. We were wrong. Every being is its own river, and it chooses the speed of its own current. When faced with the howling drag of its own wake, or the crushing pressure of gravity's forge, a system's deepest imperative is not to surrender, but to endure. It preserves its own song by singing it more slowly, more deliberately. Time dilation is not a passive distortion. It is an act of defiance. It is the audible sigh of a traveler paying the price of passage, the rhythm of a thing that simply refuses to break.
