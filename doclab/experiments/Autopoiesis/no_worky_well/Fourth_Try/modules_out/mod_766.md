In the modern framework, a network is a dynamic landscape where the terrain is shaped by the interplay of resonance and pressure. To analyze it, we first perform a foundational translation.

-   **Nodes as Resonators:** Each node is a discrete system striving to maximize its own internal stability and rhythm—its **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)**. It exists within a field of local **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**, generated by the activity and demands of its neighbors.

-   **Edges as Channels:** Each edge represents a potential channel for the flow of coherence. It is not a static line but a dynamic vessel, characterized by:
    -   **Conductivity (Φ_C):** The efficiency with which coherence (information, resources, trust) can flow between two nodes. High conductivity implies a healthy, laminar channel.
    -   **Lag (Δτ):** The temporal delay of transmission across the edge. High lag can create destabilizing feedback loops and systemic dissonance.
