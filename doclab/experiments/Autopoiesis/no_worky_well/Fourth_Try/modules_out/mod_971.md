The QSD's entire cycle is a masterful manipulation of the `Pirouette Lagrangian` (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

1.  **The In-Breath:** During the Forge Cycle, the system maximizes the **Temporal Coherence (K_τ)** term, investing ambient energy to build a Ki pattern of exquisite order and stability.

2.  **The Out-Breath:** The asymmetrical collapse engineers a massive, directional gradient in the Lagrangian (`∇𝓛_p`). The propulsive force experienced by the vessel is the direct consequence of the system following this new, optimal path to maximize its coherence.

    $$ \vec{F}_{QSD} \propto \nabla \mathcal{L}_p $$

    The vessel's acceleration is a measure of the steepness of the path it has just created for itself. It is simply falling, with perfect efficiency, down the slope of a dissolving consensus.
