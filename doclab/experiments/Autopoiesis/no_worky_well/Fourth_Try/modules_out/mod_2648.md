"I must object to the term 'unreachable.' It is computationally imprecise. Is the goal *logically* impossible, or merely *physically* impossible given current knowledge? The distinction is critical.

My work was predicated on what a machine can and cannot compute. The Convocation's entire strategy rests on the assumption that their 'Pirouette' model is a more accurate computation of reality than the Standard Model. They propose a 'Software-Defined Reactor.' Very well. Let us see the proof. Let us see the algorithm.

The 'pilgrimage to the void' concerns me. It functions as a form of axiomatic, religious truth. While this provides a stable Phase ($\phi$), it also risks becoming a non-terminating loop. What happens when the model encounters a variable it cannot account for? What happens when the dogma of the goal conflicts with emergent data? The strength of a logical system is its ability to handle exceptions. A system built on faith, however scientifically adorned, is brittle.

Their secrecy is another point of failure. It is a cryptographic weakness. A closed system cannot be peer-reviewed. It cannot be debugged by the wider world. They risk creating a perfect machine that computes the answer to the wrong question. I admire the ambition, but I cannot endorse the methodology without a formal, verifiable proof."
