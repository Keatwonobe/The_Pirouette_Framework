These feats allow a character to imbue their physical actions, particularly movement, with entropic power.

- Feat: Elemental Wake

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: An Arcane Skill pool with an elemental descriptor (e.g., Frost, Fire, Lightning).

Effect: When you take the Move action, you can spend EP from a relevant elemental Arcane Skill pool. For every 2 EP spent, you leave a 5-foot square trail of that element in one of the squares you exit. This trail lasts for one round. An ice trail creates difficult terrain, a fire trail deals minor damage to anyone who enters it, etc.

- Feat: Shadow Step

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: A "Subterfuge" Skill pool.

Effect: When you are in dim light or darkness, you can spend EP from your Subterfuge pool as a bonus action to teleport to another unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. The distance you can teleport is 5 feet for every 1 EP spent.

- Feat: Juggernaut's Momentum

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: When you take the Move action and move at least 15 feet in a straight line towards an enemy, you can spend Size Entropy from your Legs to add an equal amount of bonus damage to your first melee attack against that enemy before the end of your turn.
