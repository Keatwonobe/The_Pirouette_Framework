* Compute graph Laplacian (L = D - A) and perform spectral decomposition to isolate (\phi, \mathbf{A}) components.
* Use rolling windows ((\Delta t)) to estimate (\partial_t |\mathbf{D}|) for real-time monitoring.
* Cross-correlate (\partial_t |\mathbf{D}|) spikes with event logs (protests, market shocks, migrations).
