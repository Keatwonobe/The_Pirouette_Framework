Vampirism is a curse centered on a constantly fluctuating resource pool that governs the vampire's very nature.

The Hunger Pool: A vampire has a special Hunger Pool with a maximum capacity (e.g., 50 EP). This pool can only be filled by consuming the blood of sentient creatures. Each day, the pool depletes by a certain amount (e.g., 1d6 EP).

The Transformation: The vampire's state is directly tied to the current level of their Hunger Pool.

Sated (Hunger Pool > 50%): The vampire is in "Lordly Form." They have full control of their faculties and TEP allocation. They are lucid, cunning, and can pass for mortal.

Hungry (Hunger Pool < 50%): The thirst begins to take hold. The vampire takes a penalty to all Wisdom checks as their primal instincts sharpen.

Starving (Hunger Pool < 10%): The vampire enters "Primality Mode." They lose control.

Trigger: Dropping below 10% Hunger.

Reallocation Mandate: All EP invested in Wisdom is immediately drained and dumped into a combined pool for Strength & Dexterity. The vampire can no longer make nuanced skill checks but becomes a terrifyingly fast and strong predator. Their INT remains, making them a cunning, but purely instinct-driven, hunter.

Coherence Threshold: The GM controls the character, whose only goal is to feed by any means necessary.
