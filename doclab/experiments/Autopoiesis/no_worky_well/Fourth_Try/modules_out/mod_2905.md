An Area of Effect spell is not a pre-defined template. It is a dynamic process of spreading entropic force from a point of origin, governed by a fundamental law of resonant stability.

The Law: The entropic power in any given 5-foot square cannot exceed the sum of the power in all adjacent squares (diagonals included) plus two.
EP_center ≤ (Σ EP_adjacent) + 2

Shaping the Sprawl: The caster does not simply choose a "cone shape." They choose a point of origin (which can be their own square or a square they can touch) and an EP Budget for the spell. On their turn, they can spend Actions to "push" EP from the origin square into adjacent squares, as long as the Law of Entropic Sprawl is never violated. This makes casting a large AoE a tactical, turn-by-turn process of shaping and growing the effect.

Example: A 25-foot Cone (12 squares, 50 EP Budget): The caster starts the flow.

Turn 1: The caster spends their first action to place 4 EP in the square in front of them. They use their second action to push 3 EP from that square into the three squares in the next rank of the cone. The total EP spent is 13. The cone is small but growing.

Turn 2: The caster continues to feed EP into the origin, which then flows outward, increasing the power in each square until the full 50 EP budget is distributed across the 12 squares (averaging ~4 EP per square).

The "Orbital Strike": A caster can pump their entire 50 EP budget into a single 5-foot square. However, according to the Law, that square must be surrounded by squares containing a total of at least 48 EP. The player must spend their time and EP building up this massive "containment field" before they can unleash the final, devastating blow.
