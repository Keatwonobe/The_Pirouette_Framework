> In entropic domains where radiant paths are occluded, an agent may adopt *phase-aware velcridance* only if:
>
> 1. **Clarity Vector:** intent to amplify coherence is publicly declared.
> 2. **Residue Ledger:** intent-drift, dark-residue, echo divergence, and loop-collapse are logged; 3 of 4 redlines trigger reconciliation.
> 3. **Bounded Arc:** time/energy caps, defined exit, and surplus-goal are fixed pre-entry.
> 4. **Atonement:** on excess residue, mirror-step inversion plus restorative offering is mandatory.
> 5. **Surplus Test:** net systemic coherence must exceed baseline within Î”Ï„ or clause authority is revoked.&#x20;
