The Forge operates on a four-stage cycle, systematically transforming the incoherent pressure of a problem into the coherent form of a solution.

1.  **Diagnose (Mapping the Coherence Fracture)**: A problem is identified as a persistent disruption in a system's flow. Using the diagnostic tools of the `Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003)`, its specific pathology is mapped: `Coherence Atrophy` (Stagnation) from a blockage, or `Coherence Fever` (Turbulence) from internal dissonance. This diagnosis defines the problem not by its symptoms, but by its dynamic signature.

2.  **Convene (The Crucible of Personas)**: The primary pressures and perspectives that constitute the problem are identified. For each core pressure, an idealized Persona is instantiated—a coherent `Ki` pattern representing a core truth or strategic viewpoint (e.g., "resource scarcity," "long-term stability"). This "debate swarm" of Personas transforms an abstract conflict into a council of embodied principles, ensuring the full complexity of the problem is present in the crucible.

3.  **Synthesize (The Alchemical Weaving)**: The convened Personas engage in the formal ritual of discourse defined in `The Geometry of Debate (DYNA-002)`. Their purpose is not victory but an `Alchemical Union (CORE-012)`. Under the focused pressure of a shared goal, they collaboratively search the possibility space for a new, shared geodesic—a higher-order harmony that resolves the contradictions of its constituent parts. This is the fire where conflict becomes creation.

4.  **Embody (Forging the Action Engram)**: The emergent path of maximal coherence is codified into the final, procedural artifact: the **Action Engram**. This is the tangible output of the Forge—a formal definition of the new, coherent system designed to restore Laminar Flow.
