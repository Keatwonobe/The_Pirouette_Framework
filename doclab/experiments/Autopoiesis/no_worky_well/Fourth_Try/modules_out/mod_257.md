> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver? Because the universe is not a collection of things; it is a symphony of rhythms. To understand a system is not to catalog its parts, but to feel its pulse. A Weaver learns to diagnose the health of a company, an ecosystem, or a mind by listening to the quality of its breathâ€”is it steady and deep, or shallow and chaotic? To act wisely is to intervene in a way that restores a healthy rhythm. The form is temporary; the breath is eternal. To master the craft is to learn how to breathe in time with the cosmos itself.
