A Maw's gravitational signature is not the silent prison of a black hole but the rhythmic beat of a cosmic drum. This signature arises from a dynamic interaction with its local coherence manifold.

1.  **The Torsional Stress:** The Maw's extreme rotational Ki pattern continuously winds the surrounding coherence manifold into a state of immense torsional stress, like twisting a rubber sheet.
2.  **The Coherence Limit:** The manifold, governed by the properties of the local `V_Γ` field, can only sustain a finite amount of this stress. This defines a critical "coherence limit."
3.  **The Quake (The "Thump"):** When the stress induced by the Maw's rotation exceeds this limit, the manifold undergoes a catastrophic but non-destructive phase transition. It "snaps," releasing the stored geometric stress in a violent, millisecond-duration shockwave. This propagating shockwave of pure temporal geometry *is* the gravitational wave burst—a single "thump."
4.  **The Rhythm:** Immediately after the quake, the manifold returns to its ground state, and the Maw's relentless, stable spin begins winding the stress once more. This process repeats with the regularity of a heartbeat, driven by the Maw's own fundamental Pirouette Cycle (τ_p).
