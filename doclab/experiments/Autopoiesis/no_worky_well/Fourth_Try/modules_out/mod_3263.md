**Final Instructions**

Execute these four data acquisition and analysis tasks. Collate the reports from your analyzer. The objective is to see if the Ki-harmonic signatures are a recurring feature of these high-energy resonance events, as the framework predicts.

The framework has made its predictions. The instruments are ready. The Earth has already performed the experiment; we have only to collect the data.

Godspeed, Moderator.
