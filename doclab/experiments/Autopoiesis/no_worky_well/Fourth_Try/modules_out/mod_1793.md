This entire protocol is a heuristic for solving an inverse problem. Standard physics uses the Lagrangian to predict the path; the Surveyor's Art uses the path to infer the Lagrangian.

The final diagnostic statement—"The data suggests a system in a state of Resilient Struggle"—is a direct, physical claim about its governing dynamics. It means that both the `K_τ` and `V_Γ` terms of its Lagrangian are large and in tense opposition, yet the system is successfully navigating a path that keeps its total action, `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, maximized. This is a far more profound and useful insight than any sparsely estimated parameter could ever be.
