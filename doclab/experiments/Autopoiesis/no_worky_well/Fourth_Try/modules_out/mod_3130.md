Pirouette defines $K_i$ as the *phase-advance factor* per single spatial loop, normalised to $2\pi$:

$$
K_i \;=\; -\,\frac{\Phi_{\text{tot}}}{2\pi}\;=\; \frac{3\pi}{2\pi}= \frac32.
$$

Thus, **from Berry-phase holonomy alone we obtain a pure, dimensionless value**

$$
\boxed{K_i^{(0)} = 1.5.}
$$

This number is topological: it is the Chern class (here, the winding of the $U(1)$ fibre) divided by the covering multiplicity of the physical polarisation state.  No length, time, or energy scale enters, establishing that $K_i$ is *unitless*, answering the first reviewer objection.
