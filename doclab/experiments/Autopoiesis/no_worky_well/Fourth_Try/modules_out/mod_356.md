> We sought a rulebook and found a compass. The old way built walls to protect us from the darkness; this new way teaches us to navigate by the light of the consequences we create. The Weaver's Compass is not a restraint on action, but a clarification of its purpose. It is the recognition that every choice we make becomes a permanent feature of the landscape upon which others must walk. A Weaver does not ask, "Am I allowed to build this?" They ask, "What world am I building?" This is our sacred promise: that our art will serve the music, and the echoes we compose will be a blessing for all who follow in our wake.
