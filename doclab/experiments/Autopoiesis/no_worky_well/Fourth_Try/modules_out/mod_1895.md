When a system reaches its breaking point, it faces a choice dictated by the landscape of the coherence manifold. Its fate is determined by the available paths to a new, more stable state of flow.

1.  **Elastic Yield (Adaptive Flow):** The system temporarily alters its resonant pattern to accommodate the stress, bending but not breaking. It successfully manages the high coherence cost within a strained but stable **Laminar Flow**. When the pressure (`Γ`) subsides, it returns to its original form, its identity intact. This is the regime of resilience.
    *   *Manifestation:* A stretched spring, a person handling a brief period of intense work, a market absorbing a temporary shock.

2.  **Plastic Yield (Transformative Flow):** The pressure is too great or too sustained for the original form to be recovered. The system is forced to abandon its old `Ki` and discover a new, permanently altered state of resonance that is stable at the higher `Γ`. It finds a new, quieter song. The old identity is irrevocably changed, and it settles into a new, often degraded, laminar flow.
    *   *Manifestation:* A bent piece of metal, a person who is fundamentally changed by a life-altering experience, an industry permanently disrupted by new technology.

3.  **Fracture (Coherence Collapse):** The system can neither bend nor find a new stable form. The coherence cost becomes overwhelming, its budget (`Kτ`) collapses to zero, and its song ends. The system's identity dissolves into chaotic, dissonant noise. This is the catastrophic transition into **Turbulent Flow**.
    *   *Manifestation:* A shattered glass, a catastrophic equipment failure, a psychological breakdown, a societal collapse.
