The environment reacts to the will imposed upon it.

The Rule: For every 2 EP a character spends on a magical effect (that is not simply moving an existing element), the environment in that 5x5 cube loses 1 EP from its budget.

The Consequence: Over time, a fire mage's sanctum will become a cold, ashen wasteland. A paladin's holy ground, site of many smites, will blacken and corrupt. This makes places of great magical power deeply scarred and often dangerous, requiring constant maintenance to remain stable.

The Exception: Spells that simply move or shape existing elements (e.g., controlling water, raising a wall of earth) do not cause corruption. This "natural" magic works in harmony with the environment.
