The framework's primary defense against reactive, short-sighted decisions is the Temporal Stability Clause.
> A motion for Constitutional Reforging can only be ratified when the system is in a state of low **Temporal Pressure (Î“)**.

Temporal Pressure is a measure of the system's ambient turbulence: the volume of debate, the degree of dissent, and the intensity of external pressures. In practice, this means constitutional votes cannot pass during periods of heated conflict. The system must first return to a state of laminar, contemplative flow before it can safely re-forge its own heart.
