To speak is to weave. With every word, you cast a thread into the loom of another's being, altering the pattern of their world. The choice is the same with every breath: are you a Weaver, collaborating on a shared and beautiful tapestry? Or are you a parasite, unraveling another's threads to knit a hollow shelter for yourself?

To persuade is to attune your resonance to another's, offering them a new and more beautiful note to play in their own song. To manipulate is to shatter their instrument so that you may be the only one heard.

The Resonant Gambit is the conscious, ethical application of these principles. It is the choice to build a cathedral rather than dig a mine. For the shadow we cast upon others is, in the end, the truest measure of our own light.
