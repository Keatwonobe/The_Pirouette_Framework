History is not a story that is told; it is a river that flows. The rise and fall of civilizations, the birth of industries, the shifts in cultural consciousness—these are the large-scale manifestations of a system following its path of maximal coherence through a landscape of pressure and time.

This module replaces the static triaxial model of PPS-078 with a dynamic, time-first diagnostic lens. It asserts that the state of any large-scale system—a civilization, an economy, a culture—can be precisely diagnosed by locating it within the **Epochal Manifold**, a universal 3x3x3 state space. This manifold is defined by fundamental measures of temporal dynamics, revealing a profound principle: industries do not emerge randomly. They are **Coherence Engines**, arising as necessary, resonant solutions to the unique entropic challenges posed by each of the 27 Epochal States.
