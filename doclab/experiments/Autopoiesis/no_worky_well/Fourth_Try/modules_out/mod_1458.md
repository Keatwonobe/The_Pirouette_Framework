The Diagnostician is not a static label-maker but a dynamic, cinematic tool. The process of diagnosis involves three precise steps:

1.  **Signal Extraction:** The engine ingests a raw, domain-specific time-series and translates it into the universal language of the framework, deriving two proxies:
    *   **Coherence Signal (Kτ Proxy):** A metric for the system's internal order and efficiency (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, production yield, heart-rate variability).
    *   **Pressure Signal (VΓ Proxy):** A metric for the environment's complexity and volatility (e.g., market volatility, incoming error rates, ambient temperature).

2.  **Plotting & Quantification:** Over a defined window, the engine calculates the average level and statistical variance of both signals. It then traces the system's trajectory of `(Kτ, VΓ)` coordinates through the quadrants of the Coherence Compass. The path is as revealing as the position.

3.  **Diagnosis & Reporting:** The engine applies the logic from §2 to the quantified values to generate a human-readable diagnostic report.
    *   **Header:** System Health Audit for: `[Source Name]`
    *   **Coherence Vitals:** A summary of the average and peak values for `Kτ` and `VΓ`.
    *   **Primary Diagnosis:** The system's dominant flow state (e.g., `Turbulent Flow`).
    *   **Diagnostic Interpretation:** A plain-language explanation of the system's condition (e.g., "State of Struggle"), its health, efficiency, and probable future trajectory.
