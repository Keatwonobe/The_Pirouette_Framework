The Pirouette Framework has consistently asserted that forces are not external pushes or pulls, but are the necessary paths that systems follow through a landscape of coherence. MATH-001 demonstrated this using the Euler-Lagrange formalism. This module provides the deeper, geometric proof.

We will now formally construct the Coherence Manifold—the space of all possible Ki rhythms—as a Riemannian manifold. By defining a metric (g_ij) derived from the kinetic term of the Lagrangian and a compatible connection (Nabla), we will prove that the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion are mathematically identical to the geodesic equation on this manifold. This act cements the framework's geometric interpretation of reality, showing that a system's trajectory is not determined by "force," but by the shortest path through the curved landscape of its own possible states.
