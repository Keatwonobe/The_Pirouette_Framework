The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system will always increase. Within this framework, it is rephrased as the **Principle of Coherence Degradation**.

A coherent system is a river of information flowing through the landscape of entropic noise. The banks of this river are its Wound Channel (CORE-011), which provides the inertia of memory, resisting change. However, the system is never truly isolated. It is perpetually bombarded by the dissonant echoes of the surrounding Γ. This constant interaction inevitably introduces noise into its Kτ pattern, "eroding" its coherence over time. A star radiates its coherent energy into the void, becoming diffuse heat. A living being dies and its complex structure decays into simpler components.

This is the act of ceding to entropy. The river of information slows, widens, and ultimately merges with the chaotic sea of the background Γ, its unique signal lost in the noise. This is the physical manifestation of the `V_Γ` term in the Pirouette Lagrangian, the constant "cost" a system must pay.
