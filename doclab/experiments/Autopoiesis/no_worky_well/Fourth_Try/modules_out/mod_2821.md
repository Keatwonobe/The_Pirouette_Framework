If a caster targets a Zone that is already controlled by another being, a contest of wills begins.

The Overwhelm: The new caster invests their desired amount of EP. The being with the higher total EP invested in that Zone now controls it. The lesser investment is overwhelmed and its effect is nullified.

The Stalemate: If both casters have invested the exact same amount of EP, the Zone becomes a Contested Zone. The two elemental forces clash violently, creating a chaotic and dangerous area (e.g., a fiery vortex of thorns) that is hostile to all creatures.
