This protocol is a direct, practical application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006). A system's trajectory is the geodesic that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian, $𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ$.

Standard "forward" analysis takes the potential `V_Γ` (the pressure `r`) as a given and calculates the resulting `K_τ` (the system's behavior). The system finds its own path of least resistance.

The Resonance Tuner inverts this. We *prescribe* the desired path—the target `K_τ` (a specific orbit or stability). The protocol then solves for the one specific potential `V_Γ` (the necessary pressure `r`) that makes our chosen path the solution with the maximal action. We are not discovering the path of least resistance; we are sculpting the entire coherence manifold so that the path of least resistance leads exactly where we intend.
