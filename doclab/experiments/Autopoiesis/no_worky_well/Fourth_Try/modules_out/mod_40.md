Using EEG/MEG phase data:

* Map instantaneous Φ_i(t) → project to (Φ₁,Φ₂,Φ₃) torus.
* Fit manifold curvature κ(t) via local covariance metric.
* Track geodesic paths during awareness transitions.
* Identify vortex creation/annihilation events as phase slips.

Expected observations:

* Stable awareness corresponds to smooth 𝓜₃ surfaces.
* Transitions exhibit sudden κ spikes and topological folding.
