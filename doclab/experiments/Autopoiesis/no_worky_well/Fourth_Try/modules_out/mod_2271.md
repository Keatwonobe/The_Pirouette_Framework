This module provides the formal calculation for the anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton, executing the protocol specified in XXP-013. We will calculate the two primary contributions to the anomaly: the universal self-echo and the mass-dependent environmental coupling. This is achieved by evaluating the one-loop "Pirouette Diagram" for a Coheron's self-interaction mediated by the Pressuron field. The final result is a numerical prediction that directly addresses the observed anomaly in the muon's g-2, serving as a primary test of the framework's predictive power.
