Persistent societal inequality is not a failure of resources, but a pathology of flow. Many societies suffer from a deep, structural blockage: a vast "Coherence Dam" that impounds high-coherence resources—knowledge, opportunity, stability—within a protected reservoir, leaving the majority of the landscape in a state of **Coherence Atrophy**, a "coherence desert."

This is not a problem of redistribution, but of flow dynamics. This module provides the architectural blueprint for a **Coherence Bridge**: a systemic, multi-pillar intervention designed not to force redistribution, but to strategically dissolve the dam and restore the healthy, laminar flow of knowledge to the entire social body.
