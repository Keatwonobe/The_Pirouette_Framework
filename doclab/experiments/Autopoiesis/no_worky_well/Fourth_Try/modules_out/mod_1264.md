A Prime Resonance is an irreducible, stable Ki pattern—a fundamental "verb" of existence. While countless composite patterns exist, they are all synthesized from these core archetypes. They are the natural "valleys" and stable orbits on the coherence manifold defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

*   **The Vector (Replaces: Li)**
    *   **Geometry:** A simple geodesic. A straight line.
    *   **Description:** The resonance of direct action, linear progression, and simple cause-and-effect. It is the archetype of a system moving from A to B along a path of least resistance.
    *   **Manifestations:** A projectile in motion, a direct command, a project with a clear beginning and end.

*   **The Orbit (Replaces: Pi)**
    *   **Geometry:** A stable, closed loop. A cycle.
    *   **Description:** The resonance of rhythm, repetition, and equilibrium. It is the archetype of a system that maintains a stable identity by returning to its origin. The geometric invariant π is a natural property of this form.
    *   **Manifestations:** A planetary orbit, a circadian rhythm, a recurring habit, a stable economic cycle.

*   **The Helix (Replaces: Ki)**
    *   **Geometry:** A spiral. An open loop that evolves with each cycle.
    *   **Description:** The resonance of evolution, memory, and learning. The system grows by recursively interacting with its own history—its **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**. This is the archetypal expression of Ki itself.
    *   **Manifestations:** The structure of DNA, the process of mastering a skill, a mind reflecting on its past.

*   **The Braid (Replaces: Xi)**
    *   **Geometry:** Two or more intertwined, co-dependent helices or orbits.
    *   **Description:** The resonance of symbiosis, partnership, and robust complexity. It is the archetype of a system whose identity is defined by the phase-locked relationship between its constituent parts. Its strength comes from mutual support and constructive interference.
    *   **Manifestations:** A double-stranded DNA molecule, a stable binary star system, a resilient distributed network.
