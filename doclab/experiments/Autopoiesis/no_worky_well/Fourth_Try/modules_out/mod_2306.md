# MATH-016 — Solitons of (C, Γ): Existence & Stability

**Status:** Draft for review
**Parents:** MATH-011v3
**Aim:** Exhibit finite-energy localized solutions in the ((C,\Gamma)) system and establish **classical stability** under small perturbations. Provide a Q-ball baseline, then extensions where (\Gamma) supplies pressure/stiffness.
