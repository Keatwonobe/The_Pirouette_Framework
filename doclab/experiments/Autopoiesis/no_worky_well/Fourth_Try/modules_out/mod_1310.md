-   **Signal Processing:** The Sieve performs a *Laminar Pass* to isolate a coherent signal (e.g., a clear voice) from a turbulent background (e.g., crowd noise).

-   **System Health Monitoring:** A *Turbulent Pass* acts as a "fever detector," identifying moments of extreme turbulence (`Coherence Fever` from `DYNA-003`) in a system's data stream, flagging them as anomalies that require investigation.

-   **Text & Idea Analysis:** A *Laminar Pass* can isolate the structural, low-entropy grammar and syntax of a document, while a *Turbulent Pass* can isolate the novel, high-information-content words and phrases that carry the core message.

-   **Financial Market Analysis:** A *Resonance Band* filter can be used to study the behavior of assets within a specific volatility (coherence) class, while a *Turbulent Pass* identifies moments of market panic or chaotic trading.
