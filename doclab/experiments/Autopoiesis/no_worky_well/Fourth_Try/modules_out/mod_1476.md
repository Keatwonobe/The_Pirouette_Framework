This entire dynamic is an expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). A system navigates a complex, dynamic landscape of coherence, always seeking the path that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p`.

`Ki_static` and `Ki_dynamic` represent two distinct peaks, or "local maxima," of coherence on this landscape. The Coherence Dam is the potential energy barrier (a localized increase in `V_Œì`) that separates them. The Inertial Leap is the jump from one peak to another, occurring when the system calculates that the path through the `Ki_dynamic` maximum will yield a higher net coherence, even accounting for the energy cost of the leap. The system is solving an optimization problem in real time.
