To predict the path of a river is the work of a cartographer. To sculpt the landscape so the river flows where you wish is the work of a Weaver.

Conventional analysis asks a passive question: "Given these conditions, what will happen?" This module introduces a more potent, active one: "Given this desired outcome, what conditions must we create?" It refactors the simple logistic map into a foundational instrument for Coherence Engineering. We shift from observing the dance of chaos and order to composing the music that compels it. By treating a system's resonant state as the goal, we can calculate the precise environmental pressures required to call that state into being, transforming our role from spectator to choreographer.
