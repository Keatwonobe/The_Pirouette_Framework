summary: Reframes sociology as the study of a civilization's health, modeled as a
  living system or 'Civic Manifold'. This module applies the Caduceus Lens to diagnose
  pathologies in a society's vital currents (information, resources, trust) and defines
  its institutions as 'Civic Resonators' that determine its trajectory toward either
  coherence or collapse.
