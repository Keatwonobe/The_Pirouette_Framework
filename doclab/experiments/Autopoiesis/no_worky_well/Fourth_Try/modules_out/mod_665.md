The key to confinement lies in a non-linear feedback loop within the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`. Formally, this is expressed as `𝓛_p = T_a * ω_k - f(Γ)`. The old framework spoke of "emergent pressure from compression"; we now see this pressure is an autopoietic effect. The Temporal Pressure term, `f(Γ)`, is not merely a function of the external environment; it is also a function of the system's own resonant intensity, especially at very small or very large scales.

At specific scales, a system's attempt to express its coherence (`K_τ = T_a * ω_k`) dramatically increases the local temporal pressure (`V_Γ`). The act of "being" creates a pressure that resists that very act. The song, sung loudly enough in a small enough space, creates an echo that constrains the singer. In this state, the only way to maximize coherence is to remain within a strictly defined boundary.
