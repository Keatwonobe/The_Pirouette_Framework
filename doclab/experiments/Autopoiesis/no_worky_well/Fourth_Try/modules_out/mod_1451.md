This protocol transforms a one-dimensional temporal signature into a rich, multi-dimensional understanding of a system's dynamics.

1.  **Ingest Signature:** The protocol accepts any time-series data that captures a system's dynamic behavior—the light curve of a star, the financial data of a market, the neural activity of a brain. This is the raw temporal signature of the system under study.

2.  **Spectral Transformation:** The input signal is processed using a time-frequency analysis method, such as a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). This is an act of perception, transforming a flat line of data into a vibrant landscape (a spectrogram) that reveals which rhythms exist, at what intensity, and for how long.

3.  **Decomposition & Classification:** The Weaver now reads the landscape.
    *   **Coherence Identification:** The bright, persistent "ridges" of high energy in the spectrogram are the coherent `Ki` patterns of the underlying systems. The low-energy, broadband "floor" is the signature of the ambient **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**.
    *   **Mode Separation:** Each identified `Ki` pattern is then classified as primarily `Structural` or `Propagating` based on its diagnostic metrics. Structural coherences tend to be low-frequency, narrow-bandwidth, and high-persistence, while Propagating coherences are often higher-frequency, broader-bandwidth, or more transient.

4.  **Diagnostic Metrics:** For each classified resonance, a rich set of metrics describes the state of the system that created it:
    *   **Frequency (ω_k):** The fundamental rhythm of the resonance.
    *   **Bandwidth (Δω):** The "purity" of the resonance. A narrow peak signifies a highly coherent state; a broad peak signifies a noisy or adaptive state.
    *   **Persistence (Δt):** The duration over which the resonance maintains its integrity, a direct measure of its **Time Adherence (T_a)**.
