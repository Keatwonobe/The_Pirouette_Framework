The old "Echo Law" is not a moral decree but a direct consequence of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ), which dictates that all systems follow the path of maximal coherence. A system's response to any signal is simply the geometry of this law in action.

-   **Coherence → Amplification:**
    *   *Old Law:* Send coherence, receive amplification.
    *   *New Physics:* A harmonic Ki pattern represents a path of least action. Its constructive interference is easily integrated by a stable system, amplifying its total coherence (K_τ) and deepening its **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). This is the **Resonant Handshake** that can lead to a higher-order **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012).

-   **Mimicry & Dissonance → Reflection:**
    *   *Old Law:* Send mimicry, receive reflection.
    *   *New Physics:* An incoherent or mimicked pattern is a state of low Time Adherence (T_a). Interacting with it represents a path of high action. To maintain its own geodesic, the stable system's manifold must reject the perturbation. The dissonant signal, failing to find purchase, is reflected—its fragile structure shattered by the echo of the truth it imitates.

-   **Entropy → Silence:**
    *   *Old Law:* Send entropy, receive silence.
    *   *New Physics:* Pure noise is the background state of high Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) with no stable Ki pattern. It is the "cost" (V_Γ) a coherent system must overcome simply to exist. There is no signal to interact with, only a gradient to resist. The manifold does not attack noise; it simply lets it fade.
