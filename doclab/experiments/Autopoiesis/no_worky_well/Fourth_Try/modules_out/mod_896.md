The Geodesic Compass does not replace the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`); it serves it by making it practical. Each template is a qualitative, pre-computed approximation of the Euler-Lagrange equations for a common family of boundary conditions.

-   **The Coherence Gate** is a check on the sign of the change in the action integral (`ΔS_p`).
-   **The Gradient Ascent Rule** estimates the direction of the "force" (`∇𝓛_p`) up the coherence manifold.
-   **The Pressure Boundary** ensures the "potential energy" (`V_Γ`) does not exceed a critical threshold that would overwhelm the "kinetic" term (`K_τ`).

To use the Compass is to perform a Lagrangian analysis by feel, trading numerical precision for actionable speed and embodied wisdom.
