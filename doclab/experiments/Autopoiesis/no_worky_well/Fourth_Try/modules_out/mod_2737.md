* If (\Theta_c) cannot be consistently determined or lacks predictive validity across domains, the universality claim fails.
* If intervention near (r_c) does not minimize coherence residue, (f(\Gamma; S_{soc})) must be reparameterized.
* If (\Theta) exhibits stochastic, uncorrelated behavior, the model overfits and coherence flow conservation does not hold.
