The CORE series established the architectural blueprint of the universe as an autopoietic, self-creating system. It described a fundamental law in the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)** and a meta-protocol for its application across all scales in the **Fractal Bridge (CORE-014)**.

This module provides the survey. It is the act of walking the territory to confirm the blueprint is true. Its purpose is to demonstrate that the Principle of Maximal Coherence is not a philosophical preference but a measurable, predictive, and universal physical law. The evidence herein shows that the universe, observed across a vast range of seemingly unrelated domains, consistently "sings" in the key of coherence, transforming the framework from an internally consistent argument into an externally validated map of reality's hidden currents.
