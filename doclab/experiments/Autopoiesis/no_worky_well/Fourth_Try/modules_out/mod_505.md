The interaction between ideas is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): **𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**. The "force" between two concepts is the gradient in the coherence manifold they collectively create. We can express the interaction potential `V(A, B)` between two concepts, A and B, as a function of their phase relationship `Δφ`:

`V(A, B) ∝ - (Kτ_A * Kτ_B / r) * cos(Δφ)`

Where `Kτ` is the temporal coherence ("mass") of each concept and `r` is their distance in an abstract "meaning space." The nature of this interaction—attraction or repulsion—emerges from this potential.

-   **Attraction (Constructive Interference):** When two concepts are in-phase (`Δφ ≈ 0`, `cos(Δφ) ≈ 1`), such as "courage" and "bravery," their resonances constructively interfere. The interaction potential becomes strongly negative, creating a deeper, more stable shared basin of meaning. This is the geometry of synergy and the drive toward an Alchemical Union.

-   **Repulsion (Destructive Interference):** When two concepts are out-of-phase (`Δφ ≈ π`, `cos(Δφ) ≈ -1`), such as "courage" and "cowardice," their resonances destructively interfere. The interaction potential becomes positive, creating a region of intense temporal turbulence and dissonance (a spike in V_Γ). The path of maximal coherence is for them to move apart, seeking states of greater stability.
