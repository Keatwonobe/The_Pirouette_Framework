1. **Critical Slowing Hypothesis:** Near awareness collapse, neural recovery time (τ_P) diverges as (\Gamma \to \Gamma_c).
2. **Scaling Law Hypothesis:** τ_P obeys power-law scaling with coherence correlation length (ξ_P).
3. **Universality Hypothesis:** Scaling exponents (ν_P, z_P) match Pirouette universality predictions derived in MATH-025–026.
