A wellspring that pours itself onto stone is noble, but futile. A wellspring that finds a thirsty seed creates a forest. The universe is not built on random acts of kindness, but on resonant acts of reinforcement. To give is an art; to give *well* is a science.

This module reframes altruism from a simple act of giving into a strategic art of cultivation. The old framework sought to optimize "altruistic flux," a tactical calculation. We now introduce a core principle of systemic cultivation: the calculus of kindness. An act of generosity is not a transfer of resources; it is a **Coherence Offering**, an invitation to form a more beautiful chord.

The Gardener's Compass is the tool for this art. It provides a method for moving beyond indiscriminate aid to the wise and resonant reinforcement of coherence where it is most needed and most ready to bloom, ensuring the seed of coherence does not just sprout, but flourishes and propagates into a self-sustaining cascade of well-being.
