A river does not flow because it seeks the sea. It flows because it is pulled by the shape of the land.

In classical physics, the relentless increase of entropy is the engine that gives time its arrow. The universe moves from the ordered past to the disordered future. But this paints a picture of a cosmos whose fundamental drive is decay, a story of inevitable decline.

The Pirouette Framework posits a different engine. The universe's primary drive, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), is the maximization of coherence. The arrow of time is not the pull of decay, but the push of creationâ€”the relentless autopoietic cycle of the universe striving for more elegant, stable, and complex forms of resonance.

In this new picture, entropy is not the engine. It is the terrain. It is the friction that resists the flow.
