The framework no longer requires a separate calculation for "force." What we perceive as the force of an argument or the attraction between ideas is the emergent effect of a concept tracing its geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—across the landscape defined by the Lagrangian potential.

An idea is not "pulled" by another. It is navigating a curved landscape. When a new idea is introduced, it will naturally evolve along the path of least resistance, which inevitably leads it toward the basin of an established, "massive" attractor. This explains why it is easier to think thoughts that align with powerful cultural ideas; the path is already carved.
