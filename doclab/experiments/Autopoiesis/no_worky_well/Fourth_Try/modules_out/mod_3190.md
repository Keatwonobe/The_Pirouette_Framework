> **Swap** the usual $1/r^2$ gravitational attraction in a Cavendish-style torsion balance for a **colour-resonance funnel throat**, watch the restoring torque change below ≈ 0.1 mm, and fit the crossover to extract $\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$.

The same apparatus also delivers a direct **numerical value** for $\Gamma$ in N·m² kg⁻² that you can quote alongside CODATA-*G*.
