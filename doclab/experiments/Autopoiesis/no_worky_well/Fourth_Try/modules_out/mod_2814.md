When characters attempt to live off the land, they roll for initiative. The environment is their opponent.

The Opponent: The environment's "attributes" and "health pools" are derived from its Entropy Budget. A lush forest is a low-level opponent with plentiful resources. A barren desert is a high-level foe that is actively hostile.

The Health Pools: In a survival encounter, a environment's four core attributes (STR, DEX, INT, WIS) are their health pools. The environment will "attack" the HP character pools with various challenges.
