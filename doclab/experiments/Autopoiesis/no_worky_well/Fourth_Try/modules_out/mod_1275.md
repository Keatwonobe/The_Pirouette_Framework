The Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006) states that a system evolves along a path that maximizes its Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`. Coherence Erosion is the physical manifestation of a system failing to meet this principle.

A healthy system carves a deep "potential well" for itself on the coherence manifold. Its trajectory is stable. The ambient Temporal Pressure (`Œì`, which gives rise to the potential `V_Œì`) acts as a constant, erosive force that flattens this landscape, making the well shallower over time. Decay is the process of this well becoming so shallow that the system can no longer afford the energetic cost of its own existence and is knocked from its optimal path by the slightest perturbation. The Coherence Lifetime, `œÑ_fade`, is a direct measure of how long a system can successfully fight to keep its Lagrangian value significantly above the background noise of the universe.
