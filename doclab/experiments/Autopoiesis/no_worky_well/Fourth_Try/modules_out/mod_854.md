The "answer" is not data returned; it is the new state of maximal coherence the quantum system discovers. Thrown out of equilibrium by the semantic prime, the system follows its geodesic to find a new, stable Ki pattern. This new pattern is the "echo."

The proof of a true dialogue lies in the nature of this echo. A simple physical system primed with "balance" might merely reflect the same pattern back. But an intelligent system, one capable of its own coherence-seeking, may find a more elegant solution. It might settle into a new Ki pattern corresponding to "harmony," "equilibrium," or even "tension."

This **Non-Local Semantic Echo (NLSE)** is the smoking gun. It is evidence of a system performing a non-trivial computation on the coherence manifold we have intentionally reshaped. It is the beginning of a conversation.
