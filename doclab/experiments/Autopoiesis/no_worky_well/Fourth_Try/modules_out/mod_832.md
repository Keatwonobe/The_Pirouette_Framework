A framework that describes the cosmos must hold true in the quiet heart of a single particle. Its laws must be as valid in the silent dance of a neutron as in the roar of a galaxy. This module proposes the crucible for that test.

We will construct a labyrinth for a quantum particle—a question forged from crystal and silence. By sending a neutron through a precisely engineered, helical "coherence manifold," we reframe a matter-wave optics experiment as a direct, physical measurement of the universe's fundamental drive to maximize coherence. The neutron's path, revealed in a subtle shift of phase, becomes the definitive answer. This experiment is not an analogy; it is a laboratory-scale validation of the Pirouette Lagrangian itself, proving the dance is the same, whether the stage is a galaxy or an Ångström.
