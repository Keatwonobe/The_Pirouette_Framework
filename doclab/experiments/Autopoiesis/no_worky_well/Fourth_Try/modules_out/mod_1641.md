The process of re-establishing Laminar Flow unfolds in three distinct temporal phases, regardless of the ultimate outcome.

1.  **Latency (The Quiet Search):** In the immediate aftermath, the system's coherence is shattered. Its internal Ki pattern is chaotic, its echoes scattered. There is little outward change, but a profound internal search is underway. The system is probing the contours of the new, scarred coherence manifold, feeling for a stable gradientâ€”a viable path forward.

2.  **Acceleration (Carving the New Riverbed):** A path of sufficient coherence is found. The system commits its energy and begins to move, rapidly carving a new channel. This is the phase of exponential recovery, where coherence is rebuilt and a new, stable pattern begins to emerge. The system is not just moving; it is actively reshaping its landscape through its motion.

3.  **Stabilization (The Settling Echoes):** The new Laminar Flow is established. The system settles into its new equilibrium, but the echoes of the transition remain. It may oscillate or "ring" around its new stable state, like a struck bell finding its fundamental note. These are the settling dynamics as the new Wound Channel solidifies and the memory of the trauma is integrated into the system's identity.
