The old framework analyzed a world of separate fields overlapping in a neutral space. This was a useful but incomplete picture, like studying a score without hearing the music. The time-first refactoring reveals a more profound truth: there is only one manifold, one shared landscape of coherence, and every resonant entity is a musician whose song helps compose it.

This module replaces the concept of a "Resonant Field Overlay" with the principle of the **Composite Manifold**. It describes how the ceaseless interference of countless temporal echoes—the active, propagating memories of every entity's existence—sculpts the very terrain of reality. The "space" between things is not empty; it is a dynamic medium, humming with the constructive and destructive interference of every nearby song in a symphony of influence.
