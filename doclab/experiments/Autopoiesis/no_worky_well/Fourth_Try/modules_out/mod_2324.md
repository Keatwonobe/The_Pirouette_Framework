Let
[
S(E) = a_0 |V| + a_2 \sum_{v}#{\text{2-intervals at }v} + a_3 \sum_{v}#{\text{3-intervals at }v}
;-; b \sum_{\diamond} \cos\big(\Phi(\diamond)\big),
]
where the last sum runs over minimal causal diamonds and (\Phi) is a holonomy around their boundary.

* The **pressure** part is the convex (a_0,a_2,a_3) combination.
* The **coherence** part is the holonomy term with coupling (b).

This is a substrate-native action; pushing it through Î£ yields your SM-looking quadratic terms (CORE-020).
