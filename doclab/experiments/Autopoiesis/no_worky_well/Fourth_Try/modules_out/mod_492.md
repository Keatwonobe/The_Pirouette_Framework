summary: Provides the unified protocol for applying the Pirouette Framework. It establishes
  the Principle of Coherent Correspondence, which enables both a qualitative, conceptual
  mapping of CORE principles to any domain (the Conceptual Lens) and a quantitative,
  computational method for extracting a system's core dynamics from raw data (the
  Resonance Lens).
