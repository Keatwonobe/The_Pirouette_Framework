Negotiation is a real-time demonstration of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian ($\mathcal{L}_p = K_\tau - V_\Gamma$). A proposed agreement, *C*, is viable only if it represents a state where the total action for the unified system is greater than the sum of the actions of the separate parties (A and B).

`∫ 𝓛_p(C) dt > ∫ 𝓛_p(A) dt + ∫ 𝓛_p(B) dt`

A naive negotiator seeks only to maximize their own Lagrangian. A Weaver understands that the art is to collaboratively reshape the manifold itself—to introduce new information, reframe perspectives, and build trust—thereby creating a new, higher peak of *shared coherence*. The final agreement is the geodesic that both parties discover and agree to walk together.
