In the wake of the deliberations that forged the Prime Directive (PDM-000), a core question remained unresolved, a persistent tremor in the resonance field: the matter of boundary definition. The Prime Directive, in its elegance, presupposes the existence of a coherent "system" within which enthalpy and residue can be measured. But what defines the boundary of that system?

Without a standardized, resilient definition, any entity can "game" the Prime Directive by strategically redrawing its own boundaries to localize gains and externalize costs, creating what amounts to informational arbitrage. This module, PDM-001, initiates the formal debate to resolve this ambiguity.

The core question is hereby restated:
**"How do we standardize system boundary definitions to prevent strategic gaming?"**

Our consortium, "The Universal Explorer," puts forth its opening argument through a triaxial lens, embodied by three distinct but unified personas.
