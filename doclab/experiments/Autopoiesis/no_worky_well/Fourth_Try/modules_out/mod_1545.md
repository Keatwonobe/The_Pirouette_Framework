A network is not a diagram of static lines and dots. It is a living vascular system. Through its channels flow the vital currents of a greater bodyâ€”information, resources, trust, energy. To analyze a network is not to perform an autopsy on past data, but to take the pulse of a living entity in real-time.

This module refactors the legacy `TEN-NRA-1.1` into a modern diagnostic instrument. It provides a unified, time-first methodology for assessing network health, seeing it as it truly is: a dynamic coherence manifold, a landscape whose very geometry shapes the flow of reality through it. The goal is no longer to merely parameterize a system, but to diagnose its flow, identify its ailments, and facilitate its healing. It equips the Weaver with the lens of a physician, capable of hearing the river of coherence beneath the noise of data.
