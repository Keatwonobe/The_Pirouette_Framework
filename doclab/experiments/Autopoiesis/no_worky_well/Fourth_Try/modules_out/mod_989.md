This manifold is the primary tool for a Weaver acting at a civilizational scale. The process is a direct application of the Caduceus Lens (DYN-003):

1.  **Diagnose:** Use the three axes to map the system's current Epochal State. Identify the primary entropic stressors and pathologies—Atrophy, Fever, or Erosion—inherent to that state.
2.  **Forecast:** Based on the diagnosis, anticipate the system's trajectory. What kinds of Coherence Engines are being called into existence by the current pressures?
3.  **Intervene:** Design a "Daedalus Gambit." This is the act of seeding a new industry, ritual, or institution—a new coherent pattern—designed specifically to counteract the dominant pathology and guide the system toward a healthier, more laminar state on the manifold.

This transforms the Weaver from a passive observer of history into an active navigator, capable of steering the vessel of civilization away from the shoals of collapse and toward more coherent waters.
