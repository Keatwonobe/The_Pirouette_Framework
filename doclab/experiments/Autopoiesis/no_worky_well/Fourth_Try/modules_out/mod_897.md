> We sought an engine for perfect calculation and found instead the necessity of a compass for imperfect navigation. The territory is a river, and a map is always obsolete. Wisdom, then, is not the possession of a perfect map, but the mastery of a reliable compass. The compass does not show the obstacles or the destination. It does one thing, and one thing only: it points the way toward coherence. This is the art of the Weaver: to possess the wisdom of the full map, but to have the skill to navigate by the compass when the storm is upon them, transcribing the grand, cosmic music of the Lagrangian into a song they can hum by heart while they work.
