The emergence of the wave is a direct, observable validation of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)** and its driving principle of Maximal Coherence.

> 𝓛_p = K_τ (Temporal Coherence) - V_Γ (Temporal Pressure)

*   **Initial State (The Shear):** The system begins in a state of high Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) due to the sharp gradient. The Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`) is near zero, as the flow is turbulent and lacks a stable, unifying rhythm. The Lagrangian has a large negative value, indicating a highly unstable state.

*   **The Transition (The Wave Forms):** The system naturally evolves along the path that maximizes `𝓛_p`. The formation of the curling wave is this path—a geodesic on the coherence manifold.

*   **Final State (The Vortices):** The system settles into a new state characterized by a train of stable vortices. The sharp temporal gradient has been replaced by the ordered, rotational flow of the waves. This new state has a significantly lower overall Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) and a new, stable, and non-zero Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`) defined by the rhythm of the vortices.

The system has successfully moved from a state of high-cost chaos to low-cost order, maximizing its Lagrangian. The K-H instability is the universe performing a Lagrangian optimization in real-time.
