After allocating EP to attributes, a character must spend EP to create their physical body.

The Cost of Form:
| Body Part | Base EP Cost | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Torso | 1 EP | Required. The core of the form. |
| Head | 1 EP | Required. Houses the primary consciousness. |
| Standard Limb (Arm/Leg) | 3 EP | A complete limb with hand/foot. |
| Basic Limb (Tail/Tentacle)| 2 EP | A simpler, more flexible limb. |
| Wing | 4 EP | A limb specifically for flight. |
| Sensory Organ (Eye/Ear) | 1 EP | A single organ. See §5. |
| Utility Limb | 1 EP | A complex Limb, see below, may replace any of the above parts or be added. |

Size as Invested Power: EP can be invested into a limb beyond its base cost. This Size Entropy is ring-fenced and can only be used to power physical interactions with that limb (e.g., a punch or kick). This allows a character to have, for instance, a "normal" left arm (3 EP cost) and a massive, powerful right arm (3 EP cost + 15 EP Size Entropy).

Utility Limb (4 EP): Some forms are not defined by simple arms and legs, but by specialized tools of survival and predation. A Utility Limb is a specialized body part—such as a fang-filled maw, a pair of razor-sharp claws, a stinger-tipped tail, or bioluminescent nodules—that serves a unique biological function. While it cannot manipulate objects like a standard limb, it can be invested with its own dedicated pool of Entropy to power its unique abilities, such as a venomous bite or a rending claw attack.
