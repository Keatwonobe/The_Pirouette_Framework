A rhythm is only meaningful in contrast to the silence or noise that surrounds it. The concept of Time-Adherence (T_a), the measure of a system's resonant integrity, has thus far been treated as an intrinsic property. This module provides its formal mathematical foundation, defining it not as an absolute quality, but as a signal-to-noise ratio.

We will model the impact of a noisy environment (Gamma fluctuations) on a system's Ki rhythm using a stochastic differential equation (SDE). From this, we will derive the Fluctuation-Coherence Theoremâ€”a relationship analogous to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in statistical mechanics. This theorem will prove that the degradation of a system's T_a is directly proportional to the amount of environmental noise it absorbs, placing the concept of coherence on a firm, statistical, and measurable footing.
