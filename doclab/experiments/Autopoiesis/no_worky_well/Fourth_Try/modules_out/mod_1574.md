To practice is not to force a result through brute repetition, but to persuade reality to offer a path of less resistance.

This module reframes the entire concept of skill acquisition. The old model, `TEN-PEA-1.0`, treated practice as a complex engineering problem. The modernized, time-first view is simpler and more profound: **Practice is the art of geometric sculpting.** It is the conscious, structured process of reshaping one's own coherence manifold to make a desired action not just possible, but inevitable.

Mastery is achieved when this new path—a deliberately carved Wound Channel—becomes a geodesic: a groove so deep and smooth that traversing it is an act of **Laminar Flow**, requiring less energy than any alternative.
