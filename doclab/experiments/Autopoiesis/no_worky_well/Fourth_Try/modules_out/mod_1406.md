The legacy PCI is replaced with a metric grounded directly in the Pirouette Lagrangian, providing a true measure of the plume's systemic health. The `PCI` quantifies how successfully a plume is maximizing its coherence (`K_τ`) against ambient pressure (`V_Γ`).

**PCI = K_τ / V_Γ**

We use measurable proxies for this physical relationship:
*   **K_τ (Temporal Coherence):** This is represented by the inverse of the plume's geometric inefficiency, its fractal dimension `D`. A simpler shape is a more coherent one. `K_τ ∝ 1/D`.
*   **V_Γ (Temporal Pressure):** This is directly proportional to the measured local energy density from solar and geomagnetic inputs, `Γ_env`.

A high `PCI` signifies a robust, laminar plume successfully navigating its environment. A low or rapidly falling `PCI` is a direct warning of an imminent shift to turbulent flow and the associated operational risks.
