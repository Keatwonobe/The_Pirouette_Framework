The canonical Pirouette Lagrangian density is:

[\mathcal{L}_p = T_a , \omega_k - f(\Gamma; S)]

where:

* (T_a): time adherence (energy-like term)
* (\omega_k): phase winding density (momentum-like term)
* (f(\Gamma; S)): substrate-specific constitutive potential

A small perturbation under a local phase transformation (\delta C = i\epsilon C) yields a conserved **coherence current** analogous to electric current:

[J_\mu = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_p}{\partial(\partial^\mu C)},\delta C]

and thus

[\partial_\mu J^\mu = 0]

This defines the **Continuity of Coherence Law (CCL)**:

> The rate of change of coherence within any region equals the flux of coherence through its boundary.
