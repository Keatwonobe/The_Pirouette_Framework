This diagnostic framework is a direct, practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). The Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`) mathematically describes a system's drive to find the path of highest internal coherence (`K_œÑ`) for the lowest environmental cost (`V_Œì`).

A team in **Laminar Flow** is one that is successfully navigating its geodesic. Its actions are efficient, its internal rhythm is strong, and it is effectively managing the temporal pressure (`Œì`) applied by the opponent. Its energy is spent on progress.

A team in **Turbulent Flow** has been knocked off its geodesic. It is fighting both the opponent and itself. Its internal coherence is low, and it expends immense energy in chaotic friction, resulting in poor performance.

The analyst, by observing and quantifying the signatures of flow, is performing a real-time assessment of each team's success in solving the Lagrangian equation of the game.
