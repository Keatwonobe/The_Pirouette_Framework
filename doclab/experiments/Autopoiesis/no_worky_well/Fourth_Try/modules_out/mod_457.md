To ensure its integrity and purity, the Lexicon flows from a **Principle of the Single Source**. It is not manually curated but is generated from a single, version-controlled registry of concepts by a self-maintaining process. This engine ensures the Lexicon has perfect Time Adherenceâ€”its definition of the framework is always true and current.

The engine's workflow is threefold:
1.  **Ingestion:** The Engine traverses the entire corpus of ratified modules to identify and extract foundational terms.
2.  **Distillation:** For each term, it distills the formal definition and its Correspondence Protocol.
3.  **Synthesis:** The Engine weaves these distilled concepts into multiple synchronized artifacts, each designed for a specific mode of use.

This autopoietic cycle guarantees that the framework's language remains a high-coherence instrument, free from the dissonance of outdated or conflicting definitions.
