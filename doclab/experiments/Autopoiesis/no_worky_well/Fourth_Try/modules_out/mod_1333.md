The likelihood of a Resonance Cascade is not a mystery; it is a calculable risk. The probability of a system undergoing a Chiral Shift is a function of the external pressure it is under and the internal stress it is enduring.

The probability of a phase shift, *P(shift)*, is given by:

$$ P(\text{shift}) = 1 - e^{-k \cdot \Gamma \cdot \sigma_K} $$

Where:
*   **Γ** is the measured Temporal Pressure.
*   **σ_K** is the measured Coherence Stress.
*   **k** is a constant representing the system's intrinsic resilience or brittleness.

This equation provides a direct, quantitative tool for a Weaver to assess the stability of any system, turning the art of intuition into the science of prediction.
