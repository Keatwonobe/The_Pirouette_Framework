This experiment constitutes a direct, falsifiable test of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). Where the `g-2` experiment (CORE-009) validates the Lagrangian through a particle's self-interaction (its echo), this experiment validates it through its interaction with an external, geometrically-defined coherence manifold.

A positive result would demonstrate that a quantum system’s dynamics are governed not by pushes and pulls, but by a single, universal drive to find the most elegant and coherent path through the landscape of time. It provides the "third heart" of validation—a proof anchored not in the cosmos or electromagnetism, but in the quantum dance of matter itself.
