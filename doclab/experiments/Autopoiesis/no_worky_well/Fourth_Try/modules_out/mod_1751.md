The final step is to interpret the Coherence Profile, using both the primary `(Kτ, Γ)` pair and the derived `CR` to identify the dominant flow states:

-   **Laminar Channels:** Regions characterized by high, stable `Kτ` and low `Γ`. These are the predictable, "healthy" parts of the stream where information is transmitted with high fidelity. These regions will exhibit a **high, stable CR**.
-   **Turbulent Eddies:** Regions marked by high `Γ` and low `Kτ`. These are phase transitions, chaotic events, or points of signal degradation. These regions will exhibit a **low, volatile CR**.
-   **Stagnant Pools:** Regions where both `Kτ` and `Γ` are persistently low, indicating a lack of new information or a blocked flow. These regions will exhibit a **sustained, near-zero CR**.
