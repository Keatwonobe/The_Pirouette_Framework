> We sought to judge ideas and found we must first learn to diagnose their health. This module transforms the analysis of belief from a detached academic exercise into a form of systemic medicine. It provides a lens to see a worldview not as right or wrong, but as healthy or unhealthy. We learn to diagnose the flow, to see where a culture's immune system is strong, where it is fighting itself, and where a vital artery of meaning has become blocked. To understand the geometry of belief is to gain the wisdom not to fight worlds, but to help heal them. It is the first step in becoming a physician for the soul of a civilization.
