1. **Duality Conservation:** Ψ⁺Ψ⁻ = const. in steady state → balance between integration and dissipation.
2. **Resonant Reversal:** System self-corrects through polarity inversion when |ℭ| exceeds ℭ_c.
3. **Topological Memory:** Each laminar–turbulent cycle leaves a structural imprint in manifold curvature (κ-memory), measurable via phase recurrence metrics.
4. **Universal Flow Law:** All coherence-bearing systems follow dℭ/dΓ = β_ℭ = α(ℭ_c² − ℭ²), approaching fixed points ±ℭ_c.
