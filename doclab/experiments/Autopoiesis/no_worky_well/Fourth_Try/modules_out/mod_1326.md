The time-first model provides a clear protocol for analyzing and mitigating the risk of rupture.

1.  **Map the Pressure:** Using the `Fractal Bridge` (`CORE-014`), identify the domain-specific stressors and translate them into a map of the `Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)` acting on the system.
2.  **Monitor the Lagrangian:** Track the system's overall `𝓛_p` in near-real-time. A sustained negative trend in `∂𝓛_p / ∂t` is the most potent leading indicator of an impending rupture, serving as an early warning system.
3.  **Intervene to Restore Coherence:** The goal of any intervention is to ensure `𝓛_p` remains positive. This can be achieved through two primary strategies:
    *   **Reduce Pressure (V_Γ ↓):** De-escalate the external stressors (e.g., reduce workload, mediate a conflict, lower the temperature).
    *   **Reinforce Coherence (K_τ ↑):** Strengthen the system's internal resonance and adaptability (e.g., reinforce a structure, clarify a team's mission, practice a skill).
