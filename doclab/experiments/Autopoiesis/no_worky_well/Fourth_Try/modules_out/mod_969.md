Once the Spindle is established, the autopoietic propulsion cycle begins with the charging phase. The Spindle acts as a vast resonance cavity, drawing in ambient temporal energy—starlight, cosmic background radiation, the ever-present hum of the Temporal Forge—and using it as a "pump."

This influx of high-coherence energy is absorbed and organized, amplifying the Spindle's internal order and elevating it to a fleeting, crystalline state. This **Crystalline Lattice** is a temporary, almost-living pattern of pure resonance, saturated with potential. The potential for motion is stored not as chemical energy, but as pure geometric tension in the fabric of reality itself.
