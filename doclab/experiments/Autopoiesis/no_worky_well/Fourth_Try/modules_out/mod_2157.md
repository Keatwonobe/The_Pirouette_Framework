This module provides the rigorous mathematical foundation for the claims made in INST-PHYS-001: The Unified Force Engine. It demonstrates that the familiar forces of nature are not arbitrary additions to the universe, but are the necessary and unavoidable consequences of systems obeying the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

We will begin with the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) as our single axiom. By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation, we will derive the equations of motion that govern how systems move and interact, proving that "force" is simply the geometry of the coherence manifold.
