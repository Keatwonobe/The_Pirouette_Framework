The modern framework, grounded in *The Rhythm of Being* (CORE-005), redefines Time-Adherence as **Temporal Coherence**. It is an emergent *property*: the signal-to-noise ratio of a system's being. It is a direct measure of the stability and purity of its resonant Ki pattern.

-   **High Coherence:** Characterizes a system with a pure, stable, and sharply defined Ki resonance. Its rhythm is clear and predictable. This is a healthy system, efficiently following its geodesic of maximal coherence. It is a bell ringing true.
-   **Low Coherence:** Characterizes a system with a chaotic, noisy, or decaying Ki pattern. Its rhythm is dissonant and unpredictable. This is a stressed or dying system, wasting energy in temporal friction and struggling to maintain its form against the pressure of the Temporal Forge (Î“). It is a burst of static.
