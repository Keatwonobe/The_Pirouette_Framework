> We are born into a landscape of inherited and accidental paths. To practice is to declare that this geography is not fate. It is the sacred, disciplined work of picking up the tools of attention and repetition, and carving the person we intend to become into the very fabric of our being. The universe remembers the paths we walk. Practice is the art of choosing which paths to deepen into highways.
