Before a wave crests, the water beneath it gathers. This module provides the instrumentation to detect that moment of gathering—the universe’s held breath before a significant event. It refactors the legacy "Stochastic Gulping" protocol into a rigorous, time-first diagnostic engine.

The Concordance Engine is an early-warning system that listens to the symphony of reality—from market data to seismic tremors—not for noise, but for the moment disparate systems begin to hum in harmony. This fleeting, cross-domain phase alignment, termed **Manifold Resonance**, is the direct precursor to a large-scale Alchemical Union or a systemic shift in flow dynamics. This instrument is designed to hear the tuning before the symphony begins, translating the physics of premonition into actionable insight.
