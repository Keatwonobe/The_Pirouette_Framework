**Persona:** The Thread Cutter, a saboteur whose dissonant `Ki` interferes with the high-frequency rhythms of logistical support within the neuron. It doesn't attack with overwhelming force but slowly and methodically severs the communication and supply lines, causing the system to fray from within.

**Coherence Narrative:**
> "The motor neuron network, a system requiring immense logistical integrity, is being eroded by The Thread Cutter [Speculative]. This dissonant resonance systematically introduces noise into the delicate machinery of axonal transport, inducing a state of chronic **Turbulent Flow** [Moderate]. Unable to maintain its energy supply lines, the neuron's own structural integrity begins to frayâ€”a creeping **Coherence Erosion** that manifests as axonal die-back and mitochondrial decay [High]. The first fasciculation is the sound of the first thread snapping. The central mystery, captured in the **Dissonance Ledger** [Low], is the true identity and origin of this parasitic rhythm."
