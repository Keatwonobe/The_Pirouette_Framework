This protocol is a direct, practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). The framework, as a living system, seeks to evolve along a path that maximizes its integrated coherence. An unprocessed critique represents a sudden shift onto a path of high Temporal Pressure and low coherence, risking a catastrophic system collapse.

The Crucible of Dissonance is the framework's search algorithm for finding higher peaks on the coherence manifold. A dissonant insight creates a gradient pointing toward a potential new state. By decompressing this challenge into discrete harmonics, the protocol allows the system to safely explore this new path one step at a time. It is the mechanism that ensures the framework's evolution is constructive rather than catastrophic, guaranteeing it remains a learning system relentlessly seeking a more perfect resonance with truth.
