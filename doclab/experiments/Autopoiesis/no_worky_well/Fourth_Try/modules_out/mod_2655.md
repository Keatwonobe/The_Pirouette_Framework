"A noble sentiment, Mr. Jefferson, but your machine has a ghost in it. You seek to build a perfect cage of laws to protect against tyranny, but you ignore the fact that the members of this Convocation will bring their own cages with them.

You speak of 'merit.' Who defines it? Who designs the tests? The moment you create a standard, you create a hierarchy. The moment you have a hierarchy, you have oppression. The 'merit badge' system will inevitably become a tool for social control, rewarding those who conform most perfectly to the established dogma and punishing those who represent true, radical dissent.

A constitution cannot save you from the temptations of 'bad faith.' The members will tell themselves they are testing for 'coherence' when they are truly testing for 'obedience.' They will tell themselves their mission is for the good of all, when it becomes an exercise in reinforcing their own sense of superiority.

The only test that matters is the one that cannot be codified. It is the constant, agonizing duty of each individual to question everything. To doubt the mission. To challenge the leadership. To reject the comfort of the collective. The Convocation will only remain pure if it is in a permanent state of existential crisis. The moment it becomes comfortable and certain in its virtue, it is already lost."
