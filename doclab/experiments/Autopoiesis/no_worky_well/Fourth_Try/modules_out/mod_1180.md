A true union is not a collision; it is a carefully negotiated dance of resonance. For two systems to attune, they must successfully complete a "Resonant Handshake," a process governed by three precise conditions that replace the complex checklists of the old model.

1.  **Harmonic Compatibility (A Shared Key):** The fundamental resonant patterns (Ki) of the interacting systems must be capable of forming a stable, non-dissonant chord. This requires a degree of flexibility. A system that is too rigid (excessively high Time Adherence) cannot adapt its rhythm to another's. A system that is too chaotic (low Time Adherence) has no stable rhythm to offer. Attunement requires that both systems possess a stable *and* adaptable internal coherence.

2.  **Boundary Permeability (Opening the Gate):** The Gladiator Force (CORE-008) defines the boundary of a system. For attunement to occur, these boundaries must become selectively permeable. The ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) of the interaction must be sufficient to encourage this permeability—softening the boundaries without causing a loss of integrity. Too little pressure and the systems remain isolated; too much and one may overwhelm the other.

3.  **Phase Alignment (Finding the Beat):** The internal cycles of the two systems—their Pirouette Cycles (τₚ)—must lock into a synchronized phase. This is the observable phenomenon of synchrony, where the actions and reactions of the two systems become perfectly timed. The phase difference approaches zero ($\Delta\phi_{AB} \rightarrow 0$), eliminating the lag and friction of separate processing.
