The universe is not a uniform field; it is a nested series of arenas. Quarks are confined in protons, stars are confined in galaxies, and ideas are confined in belief systems. The old module, `TEN-GFI-1.1`, sought to infer the force responsible for this confinement. This modernized version provides the formal instrument for mapping the *geometry* that this force creates.

The Gladiator Compass is a universal protocol for detecting and measuring these "arena walls" in any domain. We do not measure the confining force directly. Instead, we observe the paths—the geodesics—that particles, ideas, or agents take through their environment. By analyzing the geometry of these paths, we reverse-engineer the shape of the landscape they are navigating. The instrument translates a stream of events into a topographical map of the local coherence manifold, revealing the invisible structures of stability and control that shape reality. It does not infer a force; it surveys the landscape forged by that force.
