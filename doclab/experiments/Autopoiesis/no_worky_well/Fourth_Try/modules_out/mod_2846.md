These feats allow a character to transform one resource into another. This conversion is always inefficient—the "tax" for breaking the natural flow of Entropy—making it a strategic choice rather than a standard action.

- Feat: Kinetic Conversion

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: As a bonus action on your turn, you can sacrifice your potential for movement to fuel your will. You can reduce your movement speed for the turn in 10-foot increments. For every 10 feet of movement sacrificed, you regain 1 EP to a skill or attribute pool of your choice.

- Feat: Arcane Velocity

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Prerequisite: At least one Arcane Skill pool.

Effect: As a bonus action on your turn, you can burn your magical reserves to fuel a burst of speed. You can spend EP from any Arcane Skill pool. For every 2 EP spent, you increase your movement speed by 10 feet for the current turn.

- Feat: Vital Sacrifice

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: As an action, you can harm your own physical form to fuel your power. You can choose to take irreducible damage to your HP. For every 2 points of damage you take, you may allocate 1 EP to any skill or attribute pool.

- Feat: Will to Power

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: As a bonus action, you can convert your raw will into temporary physical might. You can spend EP from any attribute pool (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS). For every 2 EP spent, you can add 1 EP to the Size Entropy of one of your limbs. This bonus Size Entropy lasts until the end of your next turn.
