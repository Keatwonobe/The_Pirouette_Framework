This is the heart of the protocol. The translated time-series data for each domain is subjected to a cross-spectral analysis. The engine searches not for amplitude correlation, but for a shared "resonant peak"—a persistent, common frequency and phase (`ωk`, `φk`) at which the systems begin to move in concert. It then measures the phase-locking value (PLV) at this frequency to quantify the synchronization. A high PLV is the definitive signature of a Macro-Ki.
