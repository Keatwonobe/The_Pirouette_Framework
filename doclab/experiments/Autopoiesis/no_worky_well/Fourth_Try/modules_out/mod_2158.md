Recall the Pirouette Lagrangian from CORE-006. For a single particle or system, its action, S, is the integral of the Lagrangian, L_p, over time.

S = integral(L_p) dt

Where L_p is defined as the difference between the system's internal Temporal Coherence (K_tau) and the external Temporal Pressure (V_gamma). For our purposes, we can express this in a simplified field notation:

L_p = (1/2)*(d(phi)/dt)^2 - V(phi, Gamma)

Here, phi represents the phase of the system's internal rhythm (its Ki), and V(phi, Gamma) is the potential, which is a function of that phase and the local Temporal Pressure, Gamma. The universe mandates that any system will follow a path that extremizes the action S.
