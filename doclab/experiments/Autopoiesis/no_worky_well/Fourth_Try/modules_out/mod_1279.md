A system can die in two ways: by a sudden, violent fracture, or by a slow, quiet unraveling. While a collapse is dramatic and obvious, this second pathology—drift—is far more insidious. It is the unseen erosion of form, the gradual fraying of the thread of being.

This module provides the formal dynamic model for **Coherence Erosion**, the third great pathology defined by the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003). Drift is best understood not as a distinct state, but as a chronic, low-grade form of **Turbulent Flow** (DYNA-001). It is the process by which a system, under the constant, abrasive pressure of ambient temporal noise (Γ), loses the precision of its resonant pattern (Ki) and the integrity of its memory (Wound Channel). It is the story of a system slowly forgetting how to be itself.
