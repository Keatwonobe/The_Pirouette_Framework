The output of the Auditor is not just a map of "faults"; it is a direct diagnosis of systemic pathology. The geometry of the dissonance, read through the `Caduceus Lens` (DYNA-003), reveals its nature:

*   **Coherence Fever (Turbulence):** Appears as a chaotic, high-frequency region of dissonance. The system is fighting itself, wasting energy in a storm of internal friction.
*   **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnation):** Appears as a "hole" or "void"â€”a region of deep, persistent silence where the blueprint demands a strong, clear signal. A vital flow is blocked or has ceased.
*   **Coherence Erosion (Decay):** Appears as a low-level, widespread, and slowly growing field of dissonance. The system's fundamental pattern is fraying, its form dissolving under the pressure of entropy.
