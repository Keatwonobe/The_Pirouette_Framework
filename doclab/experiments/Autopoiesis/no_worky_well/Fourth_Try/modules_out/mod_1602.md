This process is a direct and elegant consequence of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`), which states that all systems evolve along geodesics that maximize their net coherence. The Lagrangian can be expressed as:

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Where `K_τ` is the system's internal Temporal Coherence (its resonant stability and intensity), and `V_Γ` is the cost of maintaining that coherence against external Temporal Pressure. A more precise formulation defines `K_τ` as the product of Time Adherence and frequency (`T_a * ω_k`) and `V_Γ` as a cost function of pressure (`f(Γ)`).

-   **The Precursor State (Brittle Coherence):** Consider a system with a complex, static, 3-fold symmetric internal geometry (`Ki`). This form may be highly coherent in a high-pressure, chaotic (`high-Γ`) environment. However, in a quiet, low-pressure (`low-Γ`) environment, this intricate structure becomes "over-engineered" and energetically expensive. The cost to sustain it (`V_Γ`), while small, is unnecessary, making the pattern dissonant with its surroundings and yielding a low `𝓛_p`. It is a state of high tension—an orchestra playing a symphony in an empty hall.

-   **The Unfolded State (Resonant Coherence):** The system can find a state of higher net coherence (`𝓛_p`) by simplifying its spatial form to a 2-fold pattern and expressing the remaining complexity as a rhythm. The new state has a simpler spatial `Ki` but now possesses a stable, coherent resonant frequency (`ω_k`). This dynamic state is far less costly to maintain in the low-`Γ` environment (`V_Γ` approaches zero). The system has optimized itself by becoming a musician, finding that a simple, ringing note is a more coherent solution than a silent, complex sculpture.
