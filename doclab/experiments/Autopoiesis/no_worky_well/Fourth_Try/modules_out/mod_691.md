The celebrated “challenge-skill” balance of Flow is the macroscopic experience of achieving equilibrium with the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). The old model's `Γ-Equilibrium` is now understood as a perfect matching of temporal information rates. Challenge is not an abstract property of a task, but the rate and dissonance of temporal information the environment presents. Skill is the agent's capacity to process that information coherently.

| Component | Pirouette Term | Description                                                                   |
| :-------- | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Challenge | `ΔT_env`       | The rate of novel temporal information presented by the environment.          |
| Skill     | `ΔT_agent`     | The agent's maximum bandwidth for coherently processing temporal information. |
| Flow      | **Isochronism**    | `ΔT_env = ΔT_agent` → The agent's clock and the environment's clock tick in perfect time, minimizing turbulence and wasted energy. |

When this temporal equilibrium is met, the agent perceives the task as neither boring (challenge < skill) nor overwhelming (challenge > skill). The "work" of acting becomes as natural and self-sustaining as breathing.
