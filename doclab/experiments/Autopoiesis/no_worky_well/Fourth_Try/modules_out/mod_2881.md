The world is a tapestry of will, and the GM is its primary weaver. The Entropic Budget is the universal thread from which all challenges are woven. A monster's rage, a trap's deadly spring, and a merchant's stubborn haggle are all expressions of the same fundamental force. By mastering this single principle, the Architect can build a world that is not only challenging but coherent, consistent, and deeply resonant with the laws of reality itself.
