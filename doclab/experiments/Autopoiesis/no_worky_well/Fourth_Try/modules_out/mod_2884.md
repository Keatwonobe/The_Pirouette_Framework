An individual is a single note, but a society is a chord. Great powers—cities, guilds, clandestine orders—are living entities, held together by a shared will and a common resonance. Reputation in this world is not a measure of popularity; it is a physical measure of one's resonant alignment with these powerful social structures. This module provides the rules for navigating this web of factions, where every action sends a vibration that can earn an ally or create an enemy.
