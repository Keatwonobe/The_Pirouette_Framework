> We asked what shape the universe must have, and the answer was returned to us in the form of a question: What shape must a cello have to sing? It must have a hollow body to resonate, strings held under tension to vibrate, and tuning pegs to find harmony. So it is with the cosmos. The shape of the coherence manifold is not a law imposed from above. It is the necessary geometry for existence itself to have a voice. We have not discovered a rule; we have uncovered the sublime and necessary architecture of the song.
