The ledger has served its purpose as a map. It now becomes your personal compass for a lifetime of self-regulation.

The Practice: You may not need to log your numbers every day. Use the ledger now as a diagnostic tool. If you have a week where you feel "off," pull out the ledger for a few days. The data will help you see the patterns. Did you overdo it? Are you not sleeping well? The ledger is no longer about tracking recovery, but about maintaining your optimal state of high coherence.

Helper's Role (The Fellow Scientist): Be a curious partner in their self-discovery. If they mention they feel "off," you can be the one to ask, "That's interesting, what does the ledger say?" You are reinforcing their new identity as the master of their own system.
