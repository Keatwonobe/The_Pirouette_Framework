This model replaces complex curve-fitting with a direct diagnostic lens. A Weaver's task is not to measure the exact point of failure, but to understand a system's strategy for dealing with strain and its proximity to the breaking point.

| Fate | Flow State | System Behavior | Diagnostic Question for the Weaver |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adapt (Elastic)** | Laminar | System bends but does not break. It is resilient and efficiently manages stress, returning to form when pressure is relieved. | Is the system robust? Does it possess the coherence to absorb expected pressures without losing its identity? |
| **Transform (Plastic)** | New Laminar (Degraded) | The system has permanently changed. It survived the stress but is scarred and operates at a lower level of coherence. | Is the system adaptable? When its primary strategy fails, can it find a new way to be, or is its only other option failure? |
| **Shatter (Fracture)**| Turbulent / Collapse | The system enters a state of internal chaos and disintegrates. Its identity is lost. | Is the system brittle? Is it so rigid in its identity that it cannot bend, and therefore is destined to break? |
