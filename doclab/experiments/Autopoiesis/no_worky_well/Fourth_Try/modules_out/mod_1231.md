To navigate the world of ideas is to be a cartographer of these invisible landscapes. A Weaver can map them using the following protocol:

1.  **Identify Resonant Peaks:** Scan the cognitive landscape (a body of text, a discourse network) to identify the core, recurring concepts with the highest coherence (`Kτ`). These are the centers of the wells.
2.  **Map the Gradient and Flow:** Determine how these core beliefs influence adjacent concepts, revealing the "slope" of the well. Analyze how new information interacts with this landscape: Is it immediately channeled into an existing well (entrainment)? Does it create a turbulent eddy between two competing wells (polarization)? Or does it stagnate?
3.  **Assess Integrity and Synthesis Potential:** Evaluate the internal coherence (`Kτ`) of an individual or group to determine their ability to "orbit" or resist entrainment. Identify points of high tension and harmonic compatibility where the conditions for an Alchemical Union are present, predicting where a paradigm shift is most likely.
