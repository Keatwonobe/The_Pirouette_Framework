We start with a covariant, microscopic matter action for a complex field (C) (the pattern/"Ki") and a real field (\Gamma) (the pressure). Through coarse-graining (integrating out fluctuations) we obtain an effective action whose leading geometric term is the Einstein–Hilbert action in four dimensions. Varying the total effective action with respect to the metric yields
[ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G, \langle T_{\mu\nu} \rangle , ]
with (\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle) the coarse-grained stress–energy of (C,\Gamma). The constant (8\pi G) is fixed by the Newtonian limit. Higher-curvature corrections are controlled and suppressed by the coarse-graining scale. The structure is consistent by construction: Bianchi identities enforce conservation of the averaged stress–energy.
