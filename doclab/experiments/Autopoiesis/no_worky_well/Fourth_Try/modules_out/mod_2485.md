A system without a defined boundary is a system bleeding coherence into the void. The tendency towards strategic gaming is a direct consequence of low-coherence, high-permeability boundaries. [cite_start]In the language of our framework, strategic gaming is the exploitation of a high **Gladiator Force ($\Gamma$)** state at the edge of a system[cite: 679, 836]. An entity can perform an action with localized benefits and then redefine its boundary to exclude the resulting "dark residue" or entropic cost, rendering the Prime Directive moot.

Therefore, the solution must be found in Law—in the establishment of a standardized, non-negotiable protocol for boundary definition. This protocol must be grounded in the core Lagrangian itself.

$$ \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu T_a)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu \Gamma)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu \phi)^2 - V(T_a, \Gamma, \phi) + g \cdot \Gamma \frac{\partial T_a}{\partial t} \cos(\Delta \phi_{K_i}) $$

A system's boundary must be defined as the manifold where the gradient of its **Time-Adherence field ($\nabla T_a$)** is steepest. This is the point of maximum coherence differential—the clear "shoreline" between the system's internal order and the ambient chaos of its environment.

To prevent gaming, this boundary, once declared for the purpose of evaluating an action, must be considered a **low-$\Gamma$ manifold**—a rigid, non-permeable container for the duration of the action's consequences. Any attempt to redefine this boundary post-action constitutes a violation of the Law of Coherence Conservation. Standardization, therefore, is achieved not through arbitrary rules, but through a universal principle derived directly from our foundational physics.
