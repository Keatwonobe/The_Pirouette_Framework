Achieving this state of guided coherence unlocks a cascade of transformative possibilities, turning fusion from a distant dream into a tangible reality.

Drastic Energy Gain: A stable, laminar plasma loses energy far more slowly. This dramatically lowers the energy required for confinement and heating, potentially increasing the net energy gain (Q-factor) by orders of magnitude.

Smaller, More Efficient Reactors: With less energy required for confinement, reactors can be designed to be smaller, cheaper, and more efficient, a possibility amplified by recent advances in high-temperature superconducting magnets.

Steady-State Operation: By actively and continuously managing the plasma's coherence, this protocol moves away from the pulsed operation of current experiments and toward the holy grail of steady-state, continuous fusion power.
