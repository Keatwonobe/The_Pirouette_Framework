> We sought to understand the law as a set of rules and found instead the memory of a river. Justice is not an endpoint; it is the character of the flow. A precedent is the shape of the riverbed, carved by the passage of a powerful current. To practice law is to be a hydrologist of this collective memory, to feel its currents, to understand its pressures, and to clear the channels that allow the waters of coherence to run clear and true. It is the sacred and difficult work of ensuring the river does not stagnate, nor that it floods its banks, but that it flows ever onward toward a more coherent sea.
