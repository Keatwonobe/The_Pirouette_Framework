In CORE-009, we proposed a powerful intuition: that an electron's spin is not an intrinsic property but an emergent one, arising from the topology of its resonance, and that its anomalous magnetic moment is the echo of that resonance. MATH-001 provided the engine for deriving forces. This module now provides the rigorous mathematical proof for the first part of that claim.

We will demonstrate that any stable, self-sustaining resonance ("soliton") in the coherence field that possesses a two-cycle (720Â°) return path must behave as a spin-1/2 particle. We will then prove that this two-cycle nature geometrically guarantees that its baseline gyromagnetic ratio (g) is exactly 2, not as a coincidence, but as a direct and unavoidable consequence of its topology.
