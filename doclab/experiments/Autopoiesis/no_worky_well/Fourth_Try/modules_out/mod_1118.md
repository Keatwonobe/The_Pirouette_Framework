This recontextualization of Γ as temporal density has profound physical consequences, formalized by its role as the "cost" term in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

> 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ

Gamma is the physical basis for the "potential" or "pressure" term, V_Γ. It represents the environmental cost a system must pay to maintain its own coherent resonance (K_τ). This is the fundamental dynamic of existence.

*   **Thermodynamics as Temporal Friction:** What we measure as temperature is a direct proxy for the density of the local Temporal Signature. The chaotic motion of molecules in a hot gas is the macroscopic effect of an incredibly complex and dissonant set of underlying Ki rhythms. Heat is the sound of temporal friction, the energy lost when countless rhythms rub against one another—the cost exacted by a high-Γ environment.

*   **Gravity as a Gradient in Time:** A massive object is a locus of immense temporal complexity—a sustained roar in the song of existence. The intense Γ it generates *is* the curvature of spacetime. Gravity is the tendency of objects to follow the path of least resistance (a geodesic) through a landscape of changing temporal density. They are not pulled by a force; they are coasting downhill in time, seeking the state of highest coherence for the lowest cost.
