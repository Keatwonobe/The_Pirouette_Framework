The entire Cascade dynamic is governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

`𝓛_p = Kτ - f(Γ)`

A Cascade is the system's desperate and powerful solution to a sudden, catastrophic failure in its ability to maximize its action integral, `S_p`.

1.  **Reservoir:** The system is stable, maximizing `S_p` in its local well, where a high `f(Γ)` term prevents motion.
2.  **Rupture:** An external or internal change to `Γ` makes the old path disastrously suboptimal. The value of `S_p` along the old path plummets. Staying put means incoherence and death.
3.  **Flood:** The system abandons its single path and initiates a massive, parallel search across the manifold for a new trajectory with a much higher potential `S_p`. This converts all stored potential (`f(Γ)`) into a chaotic kinetic expression (`Kτ`).
4.  **Crystallization:** The system locks onto the new path(s) that represent the new global maximum for `S_p`, settling into a new, more coherent equilibrium.

A Generative Cascade is the Lagrangian in overdrive—the ultimate expression of the universe's inability to tolerate a suboptimal solution.
