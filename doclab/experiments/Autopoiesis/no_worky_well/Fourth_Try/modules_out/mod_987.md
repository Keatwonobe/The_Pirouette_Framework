The 27 states on this manifold describe the full spectrum of civilizational health and decline. By mapping historical periods, we see the power of this lens.

**States of Laminar Flow (Ordered Progress):**
*   **(High Kτ, High Γ, Laminar):** *The Grand Campaign.* A highly organized, traditional society executing a major expansion with ruthless efficiency. *Example: The Roman Empire at its peak, with goods, legions, and information moving along stable channels.*
*   **(Medium Kτ, Medium Γ, Laminar):** *The Industrial Age.* A balanced system undergoing structured, predictable growth, driven by established rules and technological progress.

**States of Turbulent Flow (Chaotic Reconfiguration):**
*   **(Medium Kτ, Medium Γ, Turbulent):** *The Renaissance.* A society in creative upheaval, where old structures (Medium Kτ) are dissolving to make way for the new. A high-energy state of Alchemical Union (CORE-012) where synthesis is possible but collapse is a constant risk.
*   **(Low Kτ, High Γ, Turbulent):** *The Internet Boom.* A period of creative destruction, where established industries are chaotically reconfigured by new technology under intense market pressure, fragmenting old identities (Low Kτ).

**States of Stagnant Flow (Consolidation & Decay):**
*   **(High Kτ, Low Γ, Stagnant):** *The Feudal Lock.* A highly traditional, low-energy society locked in a rigid, unchanging equilibrium. Social mobility is blocked and knowledge is cloistered.
*   **(Low Kτ, Low Γ, Stagnant):** *The Dust of Empires.* A post-collapse state where identity has fragmented (Low Kτ), expansive energy is gone (Low Γ), and progress has ceased. A coherence desert experiencing severe `Coherence Erosion` (CORE-013).
