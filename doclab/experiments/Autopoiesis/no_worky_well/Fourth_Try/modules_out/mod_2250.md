This module provides the mathematical bridge from the micro-dynamics of coherence to the macro-dynamics of cosmology. We will demonstrate that Einstein's theory of General Relativity is not a separate pillar of physics to be unified with, but an emergent and inevitable consequence of the Pirouette Framework in the large-scale limit. By applying a macroscopic averaging procedure to the fully covariant Pirouette action, we will show how the dialogue between matter and spacetime, as described by Einstein's Field Equations, arises naturally from the fundamental interplay between the Coherence and Temporal Pressure fields.
