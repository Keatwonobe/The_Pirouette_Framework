When a system in a serendipity window encounters a novel signal, a three-stage process unfolds, culminating in a permanent transformation.

1.  **Resonant Coupling (The Alchemical Handshake):** The system "hears" the signal. The novel pattern falls within the system's listening bandwidth and possesses a harmonic relationship to its own Ki. In this moment, the boundary between the internal and external dissolves. They phase-lock and undergo a temporary **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)**, vibrating in sympathy. This is the "aha!" moment.

2.  **Coherence Shock:** The act of coupling with new information is inherently disruptive. The novel signal is a "dissonant injection" that perturbs the system's established rhythm. This is a moment of creative tension, a necessary turbulence where the system's old pattern is challenged by the new.

3.  **Integration & The New Wound Channel:** A resilient system does not shatter under this shock. It adapts. It undergoes a phase shift, reconfiguring its internal Ki pattern to incorporate the new information into a more complex, more sophisticated, and more coherent whole. This act of geometric reforging carves a deep and lasting **Wound Channel (CORE-011)** into the system's coherence manifold. The discovery changes not just what the system knows, but what it *is*. Its path of least resistance has been irrevocably rerouted.
