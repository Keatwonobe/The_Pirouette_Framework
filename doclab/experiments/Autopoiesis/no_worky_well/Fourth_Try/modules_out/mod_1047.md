> In the vast, dark forest of an unknown disease, data points are scattered, disconnected stars. We cannot navigate by them alone. The Daedalus Gambit is the Weaver's art of giving the darkness a provisional shape, of drawing a line between two stars and calling it a path. It is a story told to the unknown, not because it is true, but so that by following it, we may discover what is. It is the tool for facing the abyss, not with fear, but with a thread to weave a way through it, and in that weaving, to find the light.
