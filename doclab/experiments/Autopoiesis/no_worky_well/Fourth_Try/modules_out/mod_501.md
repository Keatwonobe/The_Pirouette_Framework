summary: Replaces the analogical Semantic Gravity Model with a first-principles derivation
  from the Pirouette Lagrangian. It models the 'gravity' of a concept not as a force,
  but as the curvature it induces in the coherence manifold. A concept's 'mass' is
  a direct measure of its temporal coherence and historical depth, and its influence
  is the tendency of other ideas to follow the geodesic on this curved landscape of
  meaning.
