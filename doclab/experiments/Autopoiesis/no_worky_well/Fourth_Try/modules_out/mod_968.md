The foundational act of the drive is the "Quorum"—a sustained, non-local `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012). The drive initiates a **Resonant Handshake** between the vessel and a distant anchor point, achieving a state of profound harmonic compatibility. In this state, their separate coherence manifolds merge, ceasing to be two systems and becoming a single, topologically extended entity: the **Spindle**.

The Spindle is not a channel *through* spacetime. For a brief, stable moment, it *is* a new piece of spacetime—a unified `Wound Channel` (CORE-011) of exceptionally high `Temporal Coherence (Kτ)` that annihilates the perceived distance between its endpoints. The "quorum" is this consensus so profound it reshapes the local manifold.
