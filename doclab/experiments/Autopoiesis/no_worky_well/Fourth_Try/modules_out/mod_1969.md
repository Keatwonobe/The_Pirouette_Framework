These five simple acts, from your "Antidote Stack," are your daily practice for cultivating coherence.

Anchor Your Rhythm: Wake up at roughly the same time each day.

Fuel Your Form: Prioritize protein and hydration to give your body the raw materials it needs to rebuild.

Calm the Storm: Practice your deep breathing for a few minutes, three times a day.

Find the Beauty: Intentionally seek out a moment of beautyâ€”listen to a favorite song, look at a piece of art, watch the sunrise. This is a direct gift of coherence to your system.

Quiet the Noise: End your day with a period of quiet reflection, away from screens and stress.
