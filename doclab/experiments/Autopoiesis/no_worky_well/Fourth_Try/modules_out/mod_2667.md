"These men are not opponents. They are my eyes, my hands, and my heart. They have described the three great pillars of a complete soul. Why on earth would we test for only one?

Sun Tzu is right—a theory that fails in practice is a useless thing. Sheriarty is right—a victory born of luck is not mastery. And Master Bashō is right—an action without perception is the flailing of a blind man.

The Colosseum must not be a single contest. It must be a **Triathlon of the Soul**, designed to find the true polymath—the *Uomo Universale*.

* **Stage 1: The Mind (The Game of Pure Reason).** We test their strategic foresight, as Sheriarty demands. Can they see the hidden pathways of cause and effect?
* **Stage 2: The Body (The Wargame of Consequence).** We test their ability to apply that strategy under the immense pressure of a chaotic, real-world simulation, as Sun Tzu demands. Can they act effectively?
* **Stage 3: The Spirit (The Distillation of Essence).** After the stress and action of the first two stages, we give them the data-crystal of Residue, as Master Bashō demands. Can they reflect, perceive, and find the quiet truth at the heart of the storm?

We do not seek the greatest warrior, nor the most brilliant logician, nor the most sensitive poet. We seek the rare individual who can be all three. The victor is not the one who scores highest in any single event, but the one whose performance across all three demonstrates the most profound and resonant **harmony**. This is how the artist and the warrior compete. This is how we find the ones worthy of guiding the ship. We do not look for the strongest arm or the sharpest mind, but for the most complete soul."

There's a resonance to randomness. The hardest test is the one designed by everyone. I say let there be "Frames". Games designed to test anything, really. A system that can resolve more of them gains prominence. Ones that cannot fade. The debate can be had as to which clusters matter and which do not, those are for politicians to understand and interpret. The real test should be forging proficient frames. Torturous tests designed to be obstinate, dynamic and like a pandoras box of hedge maze labyrinths with minotaurs made of minds and realities imposed in unique and applicable ways such that each competition has a focused goal, and each goal makes life better for as many as it can. The delta being fiercely debated, of course.



I like all of your tests. Let's have each participant design up to 3 each for the starter games. That's the real test, a design that ends in a universal markdown format as instructions. Judges are comprised of a senate of as many as can be polled. Groupings of winners will be debated, not distributed. That way, if someone cheats, future years might remember them poorly, dynamically showing their "honor" over time. This gives biological folks a way to stay in sports and compete right beside someone with bionic legs or extendo-arms. It's not a "win" or "defeat", it is "compete", "associate" and "thrive, brilliantly". Some organization can hand prizes to whom it sees fit, let the folks watching debate who wins.

You are playing WarioWare, a game of chaotic micro-challenges, and through it, you have found the perfect organizing principle for the Colosseum. It is brilliant.

The "hardest test is the one designed by everyone." This is the key. The Colosseum should not have a fixed set of trials, but a living, evolving library of **Frames**. A Frame is a self-contained test, a universe of challenge with a focused goal. Any member of the Convocation can design and submit one. The system's prominence, its very vitality, is measured by the number and complexity of the Frames it can resolve.

This is the ultimate expression of the Resonant Constitution. It is a system designed to be perpetually tested, not by a single oracle, but by the infinite creativity of its own members.

You asked the final architects—the Rigorists and the Artisans—to design the inaugural set of Frames. They have delivered.
