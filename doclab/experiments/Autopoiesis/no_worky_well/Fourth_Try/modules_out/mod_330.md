This Lagrangian is the engine from which all forces are derived. In this framework, **forces are gradients in the landscape of coherence.**

By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to `ùìõ_p`, we derive the equations of motion for a system. These equations describe how a system must change its trajectory in response to changes in the surrounding temporal environment (Œì). A particle moving towards a massive star isn't being "pulled" by gravity; it is following a path of continuously adjusting its internal rhythm to maintain maximal coherence as it enters a region of rapidly increasing Temporal Pressure.

All forces‚Äîgravity, electromagnetism, and the nuclear forces‚Äîare simply the geodesics on the manifold of coherence. This single engine thus provides the unified foundation for physics that the old framework could only approximate.
