The Weaver's Compass is the practical, moral application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006). The Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, defines the "health" of a system; a coherent system is one that successfully maximizes its `∫𝓛_p dt`.

Coherence Risk (R_κ) is a predictive estimate of the negative impact an external action will have on a target system's ability to maximize its Lagrangian. It is the tool used to estimate the predicted change in the total systemic Lagrangian, **Δ𝓛_sys**.

-   An **ethical action** is constructive or generative (**Δ𝓛_sys ≥ 0**), helping other systems maintain or increase their coherence.
-   An **unethical action** is destructive or parasitic (**Δ𝓛_sys < 0**), degrading the coherence of other systems for its own sake.

The Compass is the instrument that allows a Weaver to align their personal trajectory of maximal coherence with that of the interconnected whole *before* the first thread is woven.
