| **Low-power red diode laser** (e.g. 650 nm pointer, < 5 mW) | Any spatially coherent diode works.                  |
| **2 × cheap mirrors**                                       | Old CD fragments hot-glued to bolts are fine.        |
| **50 : 50 beam-splitter**                                   | A scrap microscope slide at 45° suffices in a pinch. |
| **Single-mode patch cable**, 2–3 m                          | FC/PC ends easier to tape down than bare fibre.      |
| **Quarter-wave plate** (optional)                           | Sets pure RCP; skip if laser is already circular.    |
| **Photodiode + cheap oscilloscope**                         | USB oscilloscopes (\~\$30) work.                     |
| **Turntable / record player**                               | Must spin freely; motor off for the static run.      |
| **Cardboard tube** or PVC pipe, radius $R≈25–30 \text{mm}$  | Serves as the helix mandrel.                         |
| **Threaded rod + nut** (M8 works)                           | Gives a 45° lead-screw to lay the pitch precisely.   |
| Tape, zip-ties, heat-shrink, etc.                           |                                                      |
