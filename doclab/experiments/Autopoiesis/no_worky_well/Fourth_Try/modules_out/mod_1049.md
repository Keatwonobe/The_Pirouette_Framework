summary: "Re-frames the 'poison of absence' principle as a core diagnostic tenet.\
  \ It posits that many chronic pathologies are not caused by the presence of a toxin,\
  \ but by a 'Pathology of Signal Absence'\u2014a state of Coherence Atrophy where\
  \ a vital, information-bearing current has ceased to flow. The therapeutic solution\
  \ is not to attack a foe, but to restore the system's own capacity for self-regulation\
  \ by supplying the missing coherence."
