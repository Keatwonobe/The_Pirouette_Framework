Simulation can represent 𝓜₃ as a deforming surface in toroidal coordinates, colored by curvature κ(t). Awareness flows trace geodesics; bifurcations appear as topological tears.

Suggested visual mapping:

* Color = |∇V|
* Brightness = |ψ|
* Surface curvature = κ
* Line integral trajectories = awareness streams
