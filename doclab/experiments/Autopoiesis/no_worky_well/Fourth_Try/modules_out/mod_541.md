The Fractal Bridge (CORE-014) allows us to map the universal principles of flow onto the specific physiology of an organization. A business is a body, and its lifeblood is coherence in motion across four primary currents:

*   **Flow of Capital:** The efficient allocation and circulation of financial resources, not just their accumulation.
*   **Flow of Information:** The frictionless movement of critical data and insight, enabling timely and intelligent decisions.
*   **Flow of Talent:** The cycle of attracting, developing, deploying, and retaining human potential where it can have the most impact.
*   **Flow of Trust:** The unspoken current of psychological safety and shared intent that enables collaboration, innovation, and risk-taking.

The health of the business is the laminar, unimpeded state of these currents, moving in concert.
