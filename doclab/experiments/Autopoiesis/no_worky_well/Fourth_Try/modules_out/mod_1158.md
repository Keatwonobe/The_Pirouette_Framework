This principle transforms the Weaver's role from repair-person to "resonance architect." The goal of intervention is not just to fix a component, but to guide the system's entire topology toward a more resilient configuration.

-   **Diagnosis:** The first step is to map the system's coherence manifold and determine its Mode Number (`N`). Is a struggling organization (`N=4`) vulnerable because of its inherent 2x2 factionalism? Is an unstable economy (`N=12`) suffering from its many sub-harmonic fault lines?
-   **Tuning:** The Weaver then identifies minimal, elegant interventions that could alter `N`. Could adding a new communication channel, removing an arbitrary constraint, or introducing a new shared goal shift an organization's topology from a fragile `N=4` to a more robust `N=5`? Could a new regulation shift a market from `N=6` to `N=7` stable equilibria?
-   **Design:** When creating new systems, such as decentralized networks or software architectures, a Weaver can proactively design for a prime number of primary nodes or stable states to prevent the cascading failures that plague highly composite, symmetrical structures.
