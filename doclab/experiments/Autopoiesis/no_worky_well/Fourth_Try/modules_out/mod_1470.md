summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for state transitions. It reframes
  the 'snap' between static and dynamic states as a phase transition between two distinct,
  stable solutions of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The model grounds inertia, activation
  energy, and hysteresis in the geometry and memory of the system's Wound Channel.
