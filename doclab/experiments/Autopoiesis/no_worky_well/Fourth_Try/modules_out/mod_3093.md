A Crucible is not a competitionâ€”it is a **trial of alignment**. It tests:

- Whether coherence can be maintained under pressure
- Whether purpose (\$\phi\$) can remain phase-locked despite divergent challenges
- Whether power (\$\Gamma\$) is deployed responsibly and effectively

Crucibles are often paradoxical, playful, or memetically difficult. This is by design. The impossible challenge is a forge for unexpected growth.
