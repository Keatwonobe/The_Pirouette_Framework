The Temporal Forge (CORE-003) describes a universe humming with the chaotic pressure of countless interfering rhythms. And yet, the universe is not mere chaos. It is filled with elegant, stable, repeating forms. How does the universe sculpt these islands of perfect coherence from an ocean of temporal noise?

This module answers that question. We will examine the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability—the process that creates waves on water or in clouds—not as a niche fluid-dynamic phenomenon, but as a universal Rosetta Stone for **Ki Morphogenesis**: the birth of stable, resonant patterns (Ki) from the stress of mismatched temporal flows. It is the physical proof that when Time flows unevenly, it does not descend into chaos. Instead, it sings itself into form.
