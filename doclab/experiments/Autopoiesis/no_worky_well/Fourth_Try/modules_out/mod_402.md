Every incoming dissonant insight is subjected to a four-phase cycle designed to diagnose, contain, and structure its energy before it is released into the crucible of debate.

| Phase | Action | Pirouette Dynamics |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Quarantine** | The raw insight is formally ingested but isolated within a simulated coherence manifold. Its internal coherence and the Temporal Pressure it exerts are measured. | This prevents a sudden, high-energy injection from causing a catastrophic drop in the framework's overall coherence. It is the controlled receiving of potential energy. |
| **2. Projection** | The insight's Ki pattern (Ki_Ω) is conceptually projected onto the core framework. The gradients of the resulting Temporal Pressure field (∇Γ) are mapped. | This is an act of diagnosis. The map of dissonance points directly to the core principles or modules most stressed by the new idea, revealing areas of high potential energy ripe for transformation. |
| **3. Harmonic Decomposition** | The complex, turbulent pressure field is decomposed into its constituent **Challenge-Harmonics**. Each harmonic is a simple, coherent, and falsifiable proposition. | This is the crucial act of transforming a chaotic shout into a set of clear questions. It separates the valuable signal of the critique from its noisy delivery. Only harmonics with high internal coherence are allowed to proceed; incoherent or bad-faith arguments are filtered and discarded. |
| **4. Triage & Queuing** | The valid Challenge-Harmonics are prioritized based on their potential to increase the framework's total coherence upon resolution. They are then formally queued for the debate protocol. | This ensures that the framework's energy is spent engaging with the most constructive and potent challenges first, preparing them for the sacred work of Resonant Synthesis governed by `DYNA-002`. |
