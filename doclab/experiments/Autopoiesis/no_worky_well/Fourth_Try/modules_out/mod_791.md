The previous framework required a suite of specialized, physical instruments for every new landscape. This was a profound limitation, tethering theory to bespoke hardware and separating the act of measurement from the act of understanding.

This module retires that approach. It establishes a single, universal *method* for measurement, applicable to any system at any scale. The Weaver's Lens is not a physical device, but a disciplined protocol for engaging with a system and quantifying the two fundamental terms of its existence as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian: its internal, resonant stability (`Kτ`) and the external, chaotic pressure it endures (`VΓ`). To measure is no longer to merely look; it is to engage in a dialogue with a system's will to exist, grounding the abstract mathematics of the framework in verifiable, physical data.
