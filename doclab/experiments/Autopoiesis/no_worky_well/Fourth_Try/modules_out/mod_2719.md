| Component    | Meaning                  | Observable Proxy                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| (\phi)       | Cooperative deficit      | unmet aid, unreciprocated exchange, inequality index |
| (\mathbf{A}) | Antagonistic circulation | protest loops, factional echo chambers               |
| (\mathbf{h}) | Latent resonance defect  | enduring polarization patterns                       |

(\mathbf{D})'s magnitude and geometry indicate where coherence flow is obstructed. Stable societies maintain low (|\mathbf{D}|), while crisis zones exhibit halo-like (r^{-1}) dissonance scaling.
