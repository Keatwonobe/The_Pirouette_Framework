Varying (B.1) with respect to $g^{\mu\nu}$ gives

$$
G_{\mu\nu}
+
2\ell^{2}\,\Gamma^{2}
\Bigl[
R\,R_{\mu\nu}
-\tfrac14\,g_{\mu\nu}R^{2}
- \nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}R
+ g_{\mu\nu}\Box R
\Bigr]
= \kappa\,T_{\mu\nu},
\tag{B.2}
$$

where $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor and $\Box\!=\!g^{\alpha\beta}\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla_{\beta}$.
Equation (B.2) is a specific $f(R)$ gravity with
$f(R)=R+\ell^{2}\Gamma^{2}R^{2}$.  Because the extra term is *quadratic* in $R$, the theory remains ghost-free around Minkowski space and adds a single scalar d.o.f. with Compton wavelength $m_{0}^{-1}= \sqrt{6}\,(\ell\Gamma)^{-1}$ ­— analogous to Starobinsky inflation but with $\Gamma$ instead of a free mass parameter.
