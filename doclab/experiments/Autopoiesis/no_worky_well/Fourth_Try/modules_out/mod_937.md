The Crucible is the standardized experimental methodology for measuring Resonance Efficiency. It is an arena for foresight where a learnable Coherence Current is established, known to the experimenter but hidden from the test agent.

1.  **Construct the Arena:** A controlled environment is established with a hidden but stable Coherence Current (e.g., a complex, sinusoidal modulation of a core environmental parameter).
2.  **Deploy the Prophet:** The system under test, the Observer (CORE-010), must possess a "Prophet"—a subsystem responsible for modeling the Coherence Current and adapting the agent's internal `Ki`.
3.  **Measure the Ascent:** The system is rewarded not for mere task completion, but for maximizing its **Resonance Efficiency (Φ_R)**. This is quantified by periodically testing the Prophet's Foresight Horizon (**τ_σ**) and rewarding its rate of increase per unit of action cost.
4.  **Quantify Intelligence:** A system's intelligence is not a final score, but the ascent rate and plateau of its **τ_σ** curve over time. It is a direct measure of its capacity to learn.
