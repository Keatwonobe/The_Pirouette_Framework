1. **Beam-splitter (BS)** at 45° sends half the light into each arm.
2. **Straight-arm:** leave 1 m of the same patch cable coiled loosely (no Berry phase).
3. **Helical-arm:** connect the platter coil; fix both FC ends firmly with tape.
4. **Mirror recombination:** overlap the two emerging beams on the second mirror and aim the interference spot onto the photodiode (PD).
5. **Polarisation:** place a quarter-wave plate before the BS to enforce *right-hand circular* polarisation in both arms (critical for the sign of the Berry phase).

> *Tip:* adjust mirror angles until fringe contrast (“visibility”) on the oscilloscope exceeds 60 %.  Slide a fingertip on one fibre to see fringes wiggle—this confirms the interferometer is alive.
