The entire retrosynthetic process is a direct application of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006).

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

-   **The Target (`ψ_target`):** A state that represents a local maximum for Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`) and a local minimum for Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). It is a stable solution to the Principle of Maximal Coherence.
-   **The Synthesis Path:** The forward-time trajectory from a precursor state (`ψ_precursor`) to the target. This path, `S_p`, is the one that maximizes the action integral `∫ 𝓛_p dt`.
-   **Retrosynthesis:** The act of solving the inverse problem: given `ψ_target`, find the set of `ψ_precursor` states that naturally evolve into it. This is computationally equivalent to finding the "anti-geodesic" leading away from the target's attractor basin.
-   **Coherence Cost:** The action `S_p` for a given path is the direct measure of its feasibility. A lower action integral signifies a more "natural" or efficient pathway, requiring less external coherence to be injected to overcome the local Γ and complete the synthesis.
