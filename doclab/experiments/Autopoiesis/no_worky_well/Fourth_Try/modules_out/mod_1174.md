Instead of a checklist of vectors, the Weaver analyzes an artwork's potential through four fundamental lenses derived from core principles.

| Lens                        | Diagnostic Question                                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Internal Coherence (Kτ)** | How stable, complex, and harmonious is the artwork's internal pattern? Is its song a clear note or a dissonant chord? |
| **Contextual Pressure (Γ)** | How does the artwork interact with the temporal pressure of its culture? Is it a timely intervention or a timeless truth? |
| **Resonant Potential**      | How effectively does the artwork's manifold invite coupling? Is its gradient steep or shallow, its hand open or closed? |
| **Echo Potential**          | What is the likely depth and persistence of the Wound Channel it will create? Is it a whisper or a thunderclap?         |
