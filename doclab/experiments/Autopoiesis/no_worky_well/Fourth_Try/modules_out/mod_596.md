| Pathway | Flow State Analogy (DYNA-001) | Geometric & Dynamic Signature | Outcome |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Lock** | **Stagnant Flow** (Frozen Laminar) | Coherence (`K_τ`) becomes pathologically high and rigid. The geodesic narrows into an inflexible, deeply carved "rut." | A "crystal prison." The system is hyper-stable but loses all adaptability, awaiting fracture. |
| **Fracture** | **Catastrophic Turbulence** | A sudden, sharp increase in the gradient of Temporal Pressure (`∇Γ`) overwhelms the system's ability to adapt. The geodesic terminates abruptly. | Catastrophic, discontinuous failure. The system shatters into less coherent, chaotic fragments. |
| **Drift** | **Coherence Erosion** | A slow degradation of internal coherence (`K_τ`) under constant, ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). The geodesic widens, flattens, and loses definition. | A "fading echo." Gradual erosion of identity and function; the system dissolves into entropic noise. |
| **Rebound** | **Return to Laminar Flow** | A new "seed of coherence" nucleates in a high-pressure (`Γ`) environment, carving a new geodesic channel from the wreckage of the old. | Renewal and adaptation. A new order is born, often more resilient to the pressures that caused the initial collapse. |
