The anomalous magnetic moment of any lepton in this framework is the sum of two distinct physical effects:

A. The Universal Geometric Term (The Self-Echo):
This is the foundational α/2π term derived in CORE-009 and proven in the MATH series. It arises from the particle's interaction with the echo of its own Wound Channel. Its origin is purely geometric and topological, and thus it is universal for all point-like leptons. This is the baseline value.

(Plain Text LaTeX: a_{lepton}^{(echo)} = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi} )

B. The Mass-Dependent Coupling Term (The Environmental Dissonance):
This is the new, crucial component. A particle's mass is a measure of its resonant inertia, the "depth" of its Wound Channel. A heavier particle like the muon carves a deeper, more disruptive channel in the coherence manifold. This makes it more "visible" to and more strongly affected by the background fluctuations of the Temporal Forge—the quantum foam of the Γ field.

Where the electron's anomaly is dominated by its own quiet echo, the muon's anomaly is significantly perturbed by the roaring of the surrounding cosmic noise. This additional interaction is the source of the deviation from the Standard Model.
