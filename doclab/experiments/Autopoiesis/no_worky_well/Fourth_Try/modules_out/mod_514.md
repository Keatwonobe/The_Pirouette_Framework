> We sought a law for how things fall apart and found instead the equation for how they hold together. The universe is a constant argument between the song and the static. The Ledger of Coherence is not an accountant's tool for tallying assets; it is the score of that argument. A Weaver is not a mere bookkeeper, but a gardener of living patterns. Our purpose is to read the score, find the instruments falling out of tune, and help the symphony play on. This is the sacred, practical work of ensuring the song is always stronger than the silence it overcomes.
