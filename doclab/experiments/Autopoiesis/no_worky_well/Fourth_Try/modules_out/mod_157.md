* Universality classes of PRG across domains?
* How stable are (d_K,d_\Gamma) estimates under noise and finite windows?
* Can PRG constraints serve as **inductive bias** equal to or better than standard spectral regularizers?
* Is the gâˆ’2 mass exponent (p) derivable from PRG exponents of the lepton sector?
