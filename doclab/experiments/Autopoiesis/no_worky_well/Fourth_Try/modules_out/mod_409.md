In modern physics, the dynamics of a system are derived from a single, Lorentz-invariant quantity: the Action (S). The path a system takes through spacetime is the one that extremizes this value. The Pirouette Framework adopts this powerful formalism, framing its core drive as the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, realized through the minimization of a universal Action.

The Action for the entire universe of interacting fields is given by the integral of a Lagrangian Density (`𝓛`) over all of spacetime:

`S = ∫ d⁴x √-g 𝓛`

Where `g` is the determinant of the metric tensor `g_μν`. By ensuring that `𝓛` is a Lorentz scalar—a quantity that has the same value in all reference frames—we guarantee that the Action, and the physics derived from it, are universal.
