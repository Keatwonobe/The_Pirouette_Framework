This final, ongoing phase, beginning around month 6, is about making your new state of health a permanent and joyful home.

Goal 1: Integrate, Don't Isolate. Your strength is not something to be used only during "exercise time." It is a resource that should flow into every corner of your life, making your hobbies, relationships, and passions richer.

Goal 2: Joy is Your Compass. Your guide for what to do is no longer a protocol, but a feeling. The central question now is not "Can I do this?" but "Will this bring me joy?" Let that feeling guide you to a life of engagement and meaning.

The Guiding Rule: You are the Weaver. You have graduated from being the subject of this protocol to its master. You have all the tools and all the wisdom you need to navigate your own health. Trust yourself.
