This section details the various sapient peoples who have built societies in the bottom realm, from the ancient natives to the immortal survivors and their mortal descendants. Each entry provides a brief description and a standard "Body Plan" template for character creation.

- Heresy, Minor
Half-truths and forgotten whispers given form, these enigmatic beings crew the quaint wooden cities that wander the wastes. They are flighty, speak in riddles, and value the tone of a conversation over its literal content. They are powerful allies if you can learn to dance to their tune.

Body Plan (Variable Cost): Heresies have no fixed form and can be built using any combination of body parts. They are often ethereal or strangely assembled.

- Village Commoner
The mortal descendants of the first immortal survivors. They live in established villages deep within the wastes, leading normal lives and dying of old age. They are wary of the "hunted," as their presence often brings the wrath of the Skazan Order down upon them.

Body Plan (18 EP): Standard Humanoid form.

- Lepi
The original natives of the plane, these moth-like people are hardy survivors and neutral arbiters in the conflicts of the realm. Their patterned wings are their pride, and their knowledge of the wastes is unparalleled. They are the only faction that treats openly with the Skazan.

Body Plan (20 EP):

Torso: 1 EP, Head: 1 EP, Arms (x2): 6 EP, Legs (x2): 6 EP, Wings (x2): 8 EP, Antennae Senses (x2): 2 EP

Max HP: 1 + floor(0.5 * (12 + 8)) = 11 HP

- Graff
Pangolin-armadillo hybrids, the Graff are hardy desert dwellers who loot ancient ruins. They are large, scaly, and can roll into a ball for both defense and high-speed travel.

Body Plan (23 EP):

Torso: 1 EP + 4 Size Entropy (Carapace), Head: 1 EP, Arms (x2): 6 EP, Legs (x2): 6 EP, Senses (x2): 2 EP, Utility Limb (Carapace): 4 EP

Max HP: 5 + floor(0.5 * 12) = 11 HP

- Boncit
Woodpecker-folk with a unique biological adaptation. They can strike with their heads and beaks with incredible force, using a specialized utility limb in their head for both offense and defense.

Body Plan (19 EP):

Torso: 1 EP, Arms (x2): 6 EP, Legs (x2): 6 EP, Senses (x2): 2 EP, Utility Limb (Reinforced Head/Beak): 4 EP

- Saltician
Jumping spider-folk who are masters of explosive movement. They use all six of their limbs to launch themselves through the air. Some bloodlines are known to have a venomous bite.

Body Plan (26 EP):

Torso: 1 EP, Head: 1 EP, Standard Limbs (x6): 18 EP, Compound Eyes (x2): 2 EP, Utility Limb (Fangs, optional): 4 EP

Max HP: 1 + floor(0.5 * 18) = 10 HP

- Gage Mage
Elephant-folk of immense stature and intellect. They are often scholars and magi, though their physical power is not to be underestimated. A strange quirk of their biology sometimes causes the eldest among them to become unnaturally light.

Body Plan (20 EP):

Torso: 1 EP, Head: 1 EP, Arms (x2): 6 EP, Legs (x2): 6 EP, Senses (x2): 2 EP, Basic Limb (Trunk): 2 EP, Utility Limb (Tusks): 2 EP

Max HP: 1 + floor(0.5 * 16) = 9 HP

- Sha Reqa
Living elementals bound to a matrix of obsidian or other stone. Their "head" is a utility limb of pure, swirling energy, and their forms can be bizarre and asymmetrical. They are often graceful and unnervingly swift.

Body Plan (Variable Cost): Built from a Torso, a Head (Utility Limb, Pure Element), and any number of Standard or Basic Limbs made of stone.

- Chot
An empire of grasshopper-folk who dominate the dry wastes. They are a hive society, fiercely loyal to their queen-patrons. They ride massive katydids into battle and are known for their territorial raids.

- Pindel
Small, impish beings with horns, wings, and a prehensile tail. Their skin is often brightly colored like a tropical bird, and some are known to be poisonous to the touch. They are mischievous and curious.

Poison-dart frog folk who are small, agile, and deadly. Their skin is coated in a toxic mucus, but this adaptation comes at a cost: they must remain hydrated, requiring regular bathing to survive.
