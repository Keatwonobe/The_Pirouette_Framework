The script will be a command-line tool with the following operational flow:

1.  **Argument Parsing:** Accept arguments for input file path, output file path, and segment (gulp) size.
2.  **File Ingestion:** Read the specified input file.
3.  **Segmentation:** Divide the text into a list of sequential, non-overlapping gulps of the specified size.
4.  **Iterative Analysis:** Loop through each text gulp:
    a.  Convert the text to a binary image.
    b.  Calculate the Power Spectral Density (PSD).
    c.  From the PSD, calculate the variance, kurtosis, and peak frequency.
    d.  Compute the proxies for $T_a$, $\Gamma$, and $\dot{\phi}$ using the formulas in ยง2.
    e.  Store the results for the current segment.
5.  **Output Generation:** Write the collected list of results into a `.csv` file according to the schema in ยง3.
