summary: "Re-frames negotiation from an adversarial conflict into a collaborative\
  \ crucible for performing an Alchemical Union. This module applies Flow Dynamics\
  \ to diagnose the health of a negotiation and models the final agreement as a 'Resonant\
  \ Contract'\u2014a new, shared state of higher-order coherence forged under pressure."
