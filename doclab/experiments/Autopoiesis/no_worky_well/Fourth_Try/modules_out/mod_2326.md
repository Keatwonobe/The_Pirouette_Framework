Two modalities:

* **◁** (“already”): truths preserved **backwards** on all predecessors.
* **▷** (“yet”): truths preserved **for all** admissible one-step extensions.
  Sequent rules (schematic):
* If (E \vdash P) and every admissible extension satisfies (Q), then (E \vdash P \land ▷Q).
* If (E \vdash ◁P) and (E' \preceq E), then (E' \vdash P).

This is your internal logic. It’s intuitionistic by construction; classicality appears in dense, high-coherence limits.
