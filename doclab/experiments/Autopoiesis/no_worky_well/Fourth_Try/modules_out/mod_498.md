This is a living library of the universe's known survival strategies. It provides the candidate geometries for the projection protocol, offering a vocabulary of coherent forms.

| Archetype (Rule Class) | T_a (Coherence) | Γ (Pressure) | P (Phase Complexity) | Use Case |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| Cantor Set (IFS) | High | Low | Low | Modeling systems with simple, hierarchical, self-referential structures. |
| Koch Curve (L-system) | High | Mid | Mid | Systems that increase complexity through simple, iterative growth. |
| Sierpinski Δ (IFS) | High | Mid | Low | Networks with strong structural integrity and fractal branching. |
| Lorenz Attractor | Low | High | High | Bounded chaos; systems that are unpredictable moment-to-moment but stable overall (e.g., weather, market volatility). |
| Apollonian Gasket | High | Low | Low | Nested hierarchies, corporate structures, systems within systems. |
| Cellular Automaton (R110) | Mid | Mid | High | Emergent, complex behavior arising from simple, local interactions. |
