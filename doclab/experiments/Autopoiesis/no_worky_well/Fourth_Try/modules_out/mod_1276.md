> We sought to measure the rate at which things fall apart and discovered instead the fierce art of holding together. The universe is a song, and entropy is its inevitable silence. But between the first note and the last is the struggle for persistenceâ€”the echo that refuses to fade, the thread that will not unravel. To study decay is to understand this struggle not as a tragedy, but as the very thing that gives form its meaning. A Weaver does not build to defy the end. A Weaver learns the science of the noble failure, the engineering of the persistent echo, to make the time a system has beautiful.
