1. Choose (N) and priors for (C_1,\ldots,C_N) (central values & uncertainties).
2. Pick a mass-scaling exponent (p) (start with (p=1)); scan (m_\Gamma) in a sensible range.
3. **Fit (\kappa)** by matching the muon: solve (a_\mu^{\rm th}(\kappa)=a_\mu^{\rm exp}).
4. **Predict the electron:** plug the fitted (\kappa) into (a_e^{\rm th}); check consistency with (a_e^{\rm exp}).
5. Propagate uncertainties (see ยง4) and iterate (p, m_\Gamma) if needed.

> If your provisional (C_2) nudges (a_\mu) **toward** the observed central value before adding (\Delta a_\mu^{(\Gamma)}), the combined prediction typically lands **closer** still once the pressuron term is included. This is the desired pattern.
