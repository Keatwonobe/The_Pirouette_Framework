Section 2 — Cosmology Mapping (Background & Linear)
Background: treat the superfluid as an irrotational, barotropic fluid with EoS from P(X). For homogeneous FRW, X=μ−θ̇−Φ_g → μ−θ̇ and
• ρ_Γ(a) ≈ ρ_0 a^{−3} (CDM‑like) when X≫X_tail,
• transitions to DE‑like drift only if background explores the tail (controlled by COSMO‑Γ‑CMB).

Linear perturbations (Newtonian gauge):
• Fluid form with **scale‑dependent** c_s,eff^2(k) from the phonon dispersion:
c_s,eff^2(k) ≈ c_s^2 · [1 + (k/k_ξ)^2]^{−1},  k_ξ ≡ 1/ξ.
• Jeans‑like cutoff at k_J ~ aH/c_s where growth is suppressed; choose α,β to match halo core scales while keeping CMB acoustic peaks intact (c_s ≪ 10^{−3} at recombination on relevant k).

CLASS hooks (flags): `Gamma_species=superfluid`, with `P_of_X = {α, β, δ}` and `sigma_surface`, `xi_healing` derived on‑the‑fly from background n_0(a).
