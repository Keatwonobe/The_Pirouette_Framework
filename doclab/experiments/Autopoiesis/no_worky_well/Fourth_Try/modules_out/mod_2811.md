Light in the world can take one of nine levels: Total darkness > Fuzzy outlines > Vague Shapes > Dim Light > Normal Light > Full Light > Bright Light > Blinding Light > Total Whiteout

Characters can see normally in dim, normal and full light while taking a penalty to the TN of any attack or skill check made in other tiers based on how far away form perceptible it is. The target number goes up by 3 for each tier of light outside of visible light. 

Lights begin and end, meaning there is darkenss beyond them. Total Whiteout and Darkness require perceiving a target to make an attack. Feats that grant sight change or nullify these effects.
