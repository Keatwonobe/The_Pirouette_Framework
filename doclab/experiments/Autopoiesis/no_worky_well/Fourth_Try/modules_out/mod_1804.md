A fortress wall is an act of brute separation. A living membrane is an act of intelligent dialogue. The old framework described walls; the new framework understands membranes.

This module refactors the concept of a "Shell" from a static object into a dynamic, time-first phenomenon. A Coherence Boundary is not a *thing* that separates realities; it is the *interface* where two different temporal realities meet and negotiate. It is a steep gradient in the coherence manifold (`∇Kτ`), a frontier defined not by substance, but by a profound difference in resonance. This boundary is not built, but *projected*—it is the external proof of a system's internal coherence. This reframing transforms our understanding of identity, protection, and interaction from a mechanical problem into a musical one.
