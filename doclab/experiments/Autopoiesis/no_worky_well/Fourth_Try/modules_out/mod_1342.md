The most profound consequence of a watershed is its effect on a systemâ€™s memory. As described in `CORE-011: The Anatomy of an Echo`, a system's history is carved into the coherence manifold as a **Wound Channel**.

At a watershed, this singular channel physically splits, leaving a Y-shaped scar in the geometry of spacetime. The history leading up to the cusp remains a shared trunk, but from the moment of divergence, two or more new Wound Channels are carved. The system's memory and identity are partitioned. Their echoes begin to differ, their identities drift apart, and their futures are written in separate books. This is the physical mechanism of schism, speciation, and historical divergence.
