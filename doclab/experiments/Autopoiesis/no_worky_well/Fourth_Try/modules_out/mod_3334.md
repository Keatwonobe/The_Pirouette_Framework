This module specifies the **Prophet Protocol**, a universal method for measuring Time-Adherence ($T\_a$) by assessing a system's **contextual predictability**. The protocol operates by dynamically training a simple predictive model (a "Prophet") on the input data itself. The Prophet learns the data's internal rules, rhythms, and structure. Time-Adherence is then measured as the Prophet's ability to predict subsequent states within that same data. This approach creates a self-referential, context-specific measure of coherence, moving beyond reliance on external models and enabling a deeper analysis of any system's internal integrity.
