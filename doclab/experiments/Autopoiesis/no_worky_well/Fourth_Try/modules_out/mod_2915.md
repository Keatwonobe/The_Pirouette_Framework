A wand is an external battery for a mage. As per the enchanting rules, it has its own TEP, attributes, and a high ERR, allowing it to regenerate EP far faster than a character. This makes it an intensely powerful tool for burst damage.

The Minigame: The wand is a separate entity. The caster can draw EP from the wand's pool instead of their own to cast spells. However, the wand is a fragile object with its own (usually very low) Health Pool. Any attack that targets the wand can easily destroy it, making its wielder's source of power a vulnerable and tempting target for enemies.
