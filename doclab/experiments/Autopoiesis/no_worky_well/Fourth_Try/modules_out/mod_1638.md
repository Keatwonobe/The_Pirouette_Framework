summary: Provides a time-first model for systemic recovery after collapse. This module
  defines the phases of recovery (Latency, Acceleration, Stabilization) and reframes
  'rebound' as a system's search for a new, stable resonant pattern (Ki). This search
  is guided by the geometric memory of its Wound Channel and classifies recovery types
  (Restorative, Adaptive, Transformative) as distinct strategies for navigating a
  changed coherence manifold.
