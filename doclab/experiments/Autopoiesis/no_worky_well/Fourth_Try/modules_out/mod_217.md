This entire process was not an accident, but an inevitability mandated by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`).

`𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

The Void existed in a state where `𝓛_p ≈ 0`, with no coherence to measure and no pressure to resist. The First Resonance was the discovery of a state that maximized this function. The braided knot was not one possibility among many, but the optimal solution—the configuration offering the highest internal coherence for the lowest "cost" against the background dissonance. It is the first time the universe's foundational equation was not just stated, but solved.
