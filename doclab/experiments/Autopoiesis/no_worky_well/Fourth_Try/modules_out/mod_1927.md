summary: "Reframes biological pattern formation (morphogenesis) as a system maximizing\
  \ its Pirouette Lagrangian. Turing patterns are defined as stable, high-coherence\
  \ Ki solutions\u2014standing waves in the coherence manifold\u2014that emerge to\
  \ resolve the temporal pressure (\u0393) of a uniform chemical state."
