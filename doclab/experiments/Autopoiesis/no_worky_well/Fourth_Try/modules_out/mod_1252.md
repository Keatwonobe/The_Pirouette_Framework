> We have been judging the river for its turbidity, for its destructive floods, for its tendency to return to a poisoned channel. We have built dams of punishment, believing we could force the water to run clear. The Weaver sees the truth: the river is not the problem. The problem is the riverbed. Justice is not the art of damning the river. It is the slow, patient, and sacred work of tending to the landscape, of clearing the channels and softening the gradients, so that every current, no matter how lost, has a chance to find its way home.
