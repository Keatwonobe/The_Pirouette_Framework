In the aftermath, the event is gone, but its geometric impression remains. Yet this state is unstable. The Principle of Coherence Degradation (`CORE-013`) dictates that this high-information pattern will be eroded by the ambient Temporal Pressure (Î“) of subsequent experience.

This pressure is a constant, dissonant bombardment that acts like an erosive current, fraying the sharp edges of the memory. Its clarity is lost to the noise of the present. The entity feels its own truth, its own past, beginning to forget itself as the signal dissolves back into the static from which it came.
