The "choice" made during a Fork is not arbitrary; it is a direct and profound consequence of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006).

The Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`, dictates that a system will always evolve along a path that maximizes its integrated coherence over time (`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`). A Fork is simply a situation where the landscape defined by the Lagrangian presents more than one such optimal path. The Resonant Inquiry is the system's physical method for solving for the path that maximizes the future value of this integral. The system commits to the timeline that, based on the echoes it receives, promises the highest future ratio of internal resonant stability (Kτ) to external temporal pressure (V_Γ). All meaningful choice is a strategic investment in future coherence.
