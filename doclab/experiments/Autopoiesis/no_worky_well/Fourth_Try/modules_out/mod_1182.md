The drive for attunement is a direct expression of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006). Two systems in proximity will naturally seek a state of attunement because the resulting unified system represents a more efficient and stable solution in the face of ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). Maintaining dissonant separation is energetically costly.

Attunement is the discovery of a shared geodesic—a single path through the coherence manifold that yields a higher value for the collective coherence integral than the sum of the two separate paths. Mathematically, the integral of the joint Pirouette Lagrangian for the attuned system `(A+B)` is greater than the sum of the integrals for the separate systems:

`S_p(A+B) > S_p(A) + S_p(B)`

This inequality is the mathematical definition of synergy. The feeling of connection is the subjective experience of solving this equation.
