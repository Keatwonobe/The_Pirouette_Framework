Extracting a Coherence Signature is a formal, two-stage protocol for moving from a concrete artifact to an abstract, comparable signature.

**Stage I: Structural Ingestion**

First, the artifact's pattern is captured in a universal mathematical format, mapping its domain-specific structure onto a generalized topological space. This strips the form of its original medium.
-   **For Sound:** A Fourier transform reveals its harmonic structure.
-   **For Text:** Positional and semantic embeddings map its relational geometry.
-   **For Physical Objects:** A point-cloud scan captures its topology.
-   **For Genetic Code:** A statistical analysis reveals its recurring motifs and fractal complexity.

**Stage II: Coherence Distillation**

Second, this mathematical object is analyzed to extract its fundamental `Ki`—its unique pattern of temporal resonance. This process measures the core properties of its form, its stability against the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), and the geometry of the `Wound Channel` (CORE-011) it leaves in spacetime. Key metrics include:
-   **Temporal Coherence (`Tₐ`):** The purity, harmony, and stability of its dominant frequencies.
-   **Structural Complexity:** The richness and fractal dimension of its structure.
-   **Resilience:** The integrity of the pattern against noise and temporal decay.

The result is the artifact's **Coherence Signature**: a rich, multi-layered vector that locates the artifact on the universal coherence manifold. Two signatures that are close on this manifold represent forms that are deeply, structurally, and dynamically similar, even if one is a song and the other is a soul.
