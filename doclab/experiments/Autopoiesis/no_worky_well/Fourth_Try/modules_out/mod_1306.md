We replace generic filtering terms with purpose-driven principles that describe the Weaver's intent and the physical state of the data being analyzed.

| Filtering Principle | Flow State | Intent & Purpose                                                                                                                              |

| **Laminar Pass**    | Laminar    | **Isolate the Signal.** Retain only segments with high coherence (low dissonance). Used to extract stable, predictable patterns and remove chaos.  |
| **Turbulent Pass**  | Turbulent  | **Isolate the Storm.** Retain only segments with high dissonance (low coherence). Used to identify moments of chaos, phase transitions, or novelty. |
| **Resonance Band**  | Transitional | **Isolate a Specific Rhythm.** Retain segments within a specific coherence range. Used to focus on systems of a particular complexity.        |
| **Dissonance Notch**| Specific Noise | **Remove Known Interference.** Discard segments within a specific dissonance band. Used to eliminate a known source of structured noise.       |
