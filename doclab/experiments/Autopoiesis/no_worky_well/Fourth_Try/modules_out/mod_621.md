The prior framework, PPS-030, sought to build an engine for quantifying "Radiance," an attempt to convert the nuanced art of altruism into a transactional metric. It was an accountant's approach to graceâ€”a ledger for good deeds. This was a noble but premature ambition; it built an accounting system before defining the asset.

This module replaces the engine with a compass. It reframes ethics as a practical application of Flow Dynamics, moving from a score to be tallied to a diagnostic act of systemic medicine. A "good" action is not one that generates a high number, but one that can be shown to have healed a fractured system, easing its flow from a state of turbulence or stagnation into one of graceful, laminar coherence. This Weaver's Compass is a tool for navigating the moral landscape by the light of resonance itself, grounding the art of influence in the physics of consequence.
