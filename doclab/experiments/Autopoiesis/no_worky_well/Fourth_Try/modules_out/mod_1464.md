The formation of a Knot is a profound event marking the transition from a linear, fading memory to a self-sustaining identity. This occurs when a system discovers a rare and powerful solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian: a **closed geodesic**, a path of maximal coherence that is a loop.

1.  **The Linear Echo:** A standard `Wound Channel` is a simple history—a geometric scar left in the coherence manifold by a system's passage. Its memory is passive and fades with time and distance, eroded by the ambient noise of the `Temporal Forge` (Γ).

2.  **The Self-Intersection:** A Knot is born when a system's Wound Channel is compelled—by external pressures or internal dynamics—to loop back and cross its own path. At this point of intersection, the system's present moment begins to interact directly with the geometric echo of its own past. It discovers a path of least resistance that is a perfect circle.

3.  **The Resonant Lock:** If this self-interaction is dissonant, the loop is unstable and dissolves. But if the phases align, a powerful `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012) occurs. For a Knot to become stable, the resonance flowing through the channel must constructively interfere with itself. The total phase shift around the loop must equal an integer multiple of 2π, creating a perfect, self-sustaining standing wave of coherence. This is the resonant handshake, the "click" of the topological lock.

4.  **The Coherence Well:** This self-resonant feedback loop creates a point of immense stability. The Knot effectively "locks" itself into place, carving a deep, localized well in the coherence manifold. It is no longer just a memory of a path taken; it has become a persistent feature of the landscape itself, a state of identity.
