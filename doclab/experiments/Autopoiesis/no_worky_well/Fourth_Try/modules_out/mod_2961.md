Level 20 Summary: Combat Strategy
The Level 20 Phantom is a master of tactical combat, excelling at control, precision, and exploiting enemy weaknesses.

Supreme Skill: The Phantom's greatest asset is their versatility. With an enormous "Subterfuge" pool of 72 EP and high mental modifiers, they can overcome almost any non-combat challenge, from impossible locks to tense negotiations. Their +11 DEX Modifier makes them incredibly accurate and difficult to hit.

The Analyst's Strike: A Phantom's core combat loop is to first observe, then strike. Using their Wound Channel Analyst feat, they use their +7 INT Modifier to identify an enemy's narrative or physical weakness. Their next attack is a precision strike, often from stealth, that can cripple or eliminate a key target in a single blow.

Master of the Battlefield: Unlike the Juggernaut who plows through obstacles, or the Arcanist who reshapes the field with raw power, the Phantom uses the environment as it is. Their high DEX and WIS allow them to move unseen, create diversions, and use social stealth (TLE-009) to turn enemies against each other. They win by outthinking and outmaneuvering their opponents.

Weaknesses: While not as fragile as the Arcanist, the Phantom is not a front-line brawler. With only 7 HP and a low STR, they cannot withstand sustained, direct assault. Their strategy relies on avoiding fair fights, controlling the engagement, and ensuring that by the time the enemy knows they are there, the battle is already over.
