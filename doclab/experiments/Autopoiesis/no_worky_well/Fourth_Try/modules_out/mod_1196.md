summary: "Provides a modernized, time-first model for 'Bloom' events\u2014periods\
  \ of explosive, non-linear growth in systemic coherence and complexity. A Bloom\
  \ is reframed as a resonant phase transition where a system under high Temporal\
  \ Pressure (\u0393) discovers a self-reinforcing feedback loop. This triggers a\
  \ cascade of Alchemical Unions, creating a rapid shift from Turbulent to Laminar\
  \ Flow as the system follows a new, more efficient geodesic on its coherence manifold."
