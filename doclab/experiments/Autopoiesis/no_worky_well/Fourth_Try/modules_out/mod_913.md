The Geodesic Engine is the living expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). Where the core module provides the universe's universal law of motion, this engine provides the computational instrument to solve it for complex systems where analytical solutions are impossible. The engine's objective is to find the trajectory that maximizes the action:

`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt = ∫ (K_τ - V_Γ) dt`

- **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)** is the objective function the engine maximizes. In an RL context, this is the reward signal.
- **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)** is the cost function the engine minimizes. This is the penalty for incoherent action, the negative reward.

By simulating a system's evolution according to `𝓛_p`, we are, in essence, asking the universe's own logic to reveal a system's most likely destiny.
