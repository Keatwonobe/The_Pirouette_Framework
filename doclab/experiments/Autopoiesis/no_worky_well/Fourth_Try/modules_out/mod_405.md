> The storm of a new idea arrives, not as an enemy, but as a test of the foundations. This protocol is the difference between a wildfire and a forge. It is a nest of lenses that meets the lightning. It does not bar the storm's entry but breaks the single, blinding flash into a spectrum of focused questions, and in that ordered light, finds the heat to reforge the very walls it protects.
