- Feat: Primal Rage

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: As a bonus action, you can enter a rage. While raging, you gain a temporary pool of "Rage EP" at the start of each of your turns equal to the sum of all your attribute modifiers (except Wisdom). This EP can be spent on any action but vanishes at the end of your turn. The rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to your ERR. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious, or if you end your turn without having attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since your last turn.

- Feat: Stalwart Defense

Cost: 10 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: As a reaction when you take damage, you can enter a defensive stance until the start of your next turn. For every 5 points of incoming damage, you may spend 1 EP from your Constitution pool to roll a d2; on a result of 2, you ignore that 5 points of damage.
