A system is not born with perfect discernment. It learns. The calibration of this triage calculus is an autopoietic process. By controlled exposure to a spectrum of inputs—from harmonic to mildly dissonant to actively hostile—the system learns to more accurately predict the coherence cost of engagement. Each interaction, whether a successful synthesis or a necessary quarantine, deepens the geometric memory of its own identity, sharpening its immune response. This is the process of a system learning the shape of its own health.
