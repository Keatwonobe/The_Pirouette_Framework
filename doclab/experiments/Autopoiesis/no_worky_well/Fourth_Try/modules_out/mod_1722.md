The accumulated Temporal Pressure (Γ) eventually exceeds the structural integrity of the dam. The dam shatters. The system transitions instantaneously and violently into a state of extreme **Turbulent Flow** (*low $T_a$, high Γ*). This is the spasm itself—a chaotic, inefficient, and often destructive release of the pent-up pressure. While dangerous, this phase is also profoundly creative; the chaotic flow explores the system's entire state space, searching for any possible new path forward. It is the universe's version of shaking the board to see where the pieces land.
