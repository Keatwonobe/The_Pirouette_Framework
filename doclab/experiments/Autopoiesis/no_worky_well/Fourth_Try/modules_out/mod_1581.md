A plan is not a map of a river that already exists. It is the architect's blueprint for the riverbed itself, carved into the landscape of possibility before the first drop of water begins to flow.

This module refactors the analysis of planning from a static assessment of components into a dynamic, time-first model. It discards the notion of a plan as a document to be followed and re-envisions it as a *dynamic hypothesis*â€”an active, resonant projection of will. A plan is a **proposed geodesic**: a hypothesized path of maximal coherence designed to guide a system from its present state to a desired future state with the least possible friction. Its success is not measured by rigid adherence, but by the quality of the channel it carves for the future flow of action.
