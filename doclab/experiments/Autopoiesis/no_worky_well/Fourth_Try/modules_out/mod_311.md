summary: "Re-frames the 'Anchor and Sail' duality (PNS-015) into a core dynamics model.\
  \ Will (the Anchor) is the strategy of maximizing internal coherence (K\u03C4),\
  \ while Freedom (the Sail) is the strategy of adapting to environmental pressure\
  \ (V_\u0393). True autonomy is defined as the dynamic, tensegrity-like balance between\
  \ these two poles to optimize the Pirouette Lagrangian."
