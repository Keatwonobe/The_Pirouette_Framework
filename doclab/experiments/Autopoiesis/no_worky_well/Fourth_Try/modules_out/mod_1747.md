The old protocol was anchored in Shannon entropy, a powerful but static measure of disorder. The new framework allows for a more dynamic and profound diagnosis, grounded in the principles of `CORE-013: The River of Information`.

-   **Information as Coherence (`Kτ`):** We no longer see data as a static list of symbols, but as a dynamic current. The true signal within this current is its Coherence (`Kτ`)—the measure of stable, resonant, and meaningful patterns within a segment of the stream. It is the melody, the information itself.
-   **Noise as Dissonance (`Γ`):** What was previously measured as "high entropy" is now identified as Dissonance (`Γ`). This is the measure of chaotic, turbulent, and unstructured temporal pressure that degrades the signal. It is the static that obscures the melody.

By profiling a stream in terms of the interplay between Coherence and Dissonance, we can diagnose its state of flow (`Laminar`, `Turbulent`, or `Stagnant`) with far greater precision, as defined in `DYNA-001`.
