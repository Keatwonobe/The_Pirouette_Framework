“The Prime Directive hinges on precise definitions of \(H_p\), \(H_t\), and \(D\). Without standardized calorimetric protocols and agreed-upon boundary conditions, agents cannot reliably compute \(\Delta H = |H_p - H_t|\) or ‘Dark Residue’ \(D = -\!\int (dQ/T)\,dV\). This ambiguity renders optimization ill-posed.”
