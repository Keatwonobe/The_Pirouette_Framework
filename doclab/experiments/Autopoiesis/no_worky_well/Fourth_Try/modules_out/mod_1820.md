Stirring is the act of temporarily transforming the landscape to reveal those deeper wells. It is a three-part gambit of precision and timing.

1.  **The Dissonant Injection:** The Weaver introduces a turbulent signal into the system's environment. This is not random noise, but a carefully chosen pattern of dissonance designed to interfere with the system's entrenched Ki resonance. This injection dramatically, but temporarily, increases the local Temporal Pressure (Î“), forcing the system out of its comfortable flow state and into a state of "Coherence Fever" (`DYNA-003`).

2.  **The Alchemical Dose: Anatomy of the Storm:** The intensity and character of the stir is the difference between catalysis and catastrophe. The dose is defined by three parameters:
    *   **Intensity (Amplitude):** The sheer magnitude of the injected dissonance. A gentle stir encourages exploration; a vigorous stir forces a fundamental reorganization or risks dissolution.
    *   **Rhythm (Frequency):** The temporal pattern of the dissonance. A constant pressure is a blunt instrument. A rhythmic pulse, tuned to a natural harmonic of the target system, creates **resonant turbulence**, allowing for a maximally efficient transfer of energy. It uses a system's own nature to coax it out of its rut with minimal force.
    *   **Duration:** The time over which the dissonance is applied. Too brief a stir fails to overcome the system's inertia (`CORE-011`). Too long a stir erodes the system's coherent memory, causing it to shatter rather than transform.

3.  **The Return to Calm:** The Weaver must know when to stop stirring. The dissonant signal is removed, allowing the system's natural, intrinsic drive to maximize coherence to take over.
