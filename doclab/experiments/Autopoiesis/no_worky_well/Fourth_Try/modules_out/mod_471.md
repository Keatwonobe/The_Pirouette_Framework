Membership in the Weaver's Conclave is not a title; it is an active function. To maintain their position, each Weaver must, within each major version cycle, successfully author or sponsor a motion that passes a Coherence Test. This is not a bureaucratic hurdle; it is a grounding ritual ensuring that the guardians of the framework are also its most active and dedicated cultivators. Failure to contribute demonstrates a desynchronization with the framework's evolving rhythm, and the seat is vacated to allow a more resonant Weaver to participate.
