We work on flat space for the loop computation (curved effects are higher order here). Matter Lagrangian (relevant pieces):
[
\mathcal L
= (\partial C)^*(\partial C)

* \tfrac12(\partial\Gamma)^2

- V(|C|^2,\Gamma)
- e,\bar\psi_\ell \gamma^\mu A_\mu \psi_\ell
  ;+; \underbrace{g_\ell,\Gamma,\bar\psi_\ell\psi_\ell}_{\text{pressuronâ€“lepton portal}}

* \cdots
  ]
  We model the lepton as a Dirac field (\psi_\ell) (since (g-2) is a Dirac observable) and take a **Yukawa-type** portal to the pressuron (\Gamma).

**Mass dimensions (4D):** ([\psi]=3/2), ([\Gamma]=1) (\Rightarrow) ([g_\ell]=0) (dimensionless Yukawa). This keeps (\Delta a_\ell\sim \alpha,g_\ell^2) and makes power counting transparent.

**Scaling hypothesis:** heavier leptons couple more strongly to temporal pressure,
[
g_\ell=\kappa\left(\frac{m_\ell}{m_e}\right)^p,\qquad p\ge 0,
]
with base strength (\kappa\equiv g_e). Default working choice: **(p=1)** (linear mass scaling), but keep (p) symbolic.
