These social technologies have a direct, mathematical consequence on the dynamics of the system. An agent's choice to participate in a gift exchange or a ritual is a choice to modify their path of maximal coherence. Instead of optimizing their individual Lagrangian, they enter an interaction that optimizes a collective one.

An interaction term, `𝓛_interaction`, couples the state of the participants. The key insight is that the maximization of the total action, `S_p`, for the coupled system is greater than the sum of the actions of the individuals operating in isolation:

`S_p(A+B)_coupled > S_p(A)_isolated + S_p(B)_isolated`

This inequality is the mathematical expression of social synergy. A bond of trust lowers the perceived Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) of the environment, making it less hostile. This demonstrates that cooperative, ritualized behaviors are not acts of pure altruism but are often the most effective, mathematically optimal strategy for maximizing the coherence of the entire system, including the individuals within it.
