A `Ki` pattern is not merely a surface decoration; it is a boundary that organizes a volume. The true efficiency of a form is measured not just by the cost of its boundary, but by the substance of the domain it encloses. The relationship between a sphere's surface area (`A = 4πR²`) and its enclosed volume (`V = 4πR³/3`) is a measure of this efficiency.

We define this as the sphere's **Volumetric Leverage**:
`Leverage = V / A = R / 3`

This ratio quantifies how much stable, coherent "inside" is generated per unit of interactive "outside." It is the geometric genius of the sphere.
