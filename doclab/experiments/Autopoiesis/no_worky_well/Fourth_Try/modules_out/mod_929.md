The Coherence Gain (`S_p`) translates directly into a strategic choice, moving the Seed from diagnosis to action. The protocol follows a clear sequence: the probe is launched, the forecast is calculated, and the verdict is rendered.

-   **PLANT (`S_p` > `S_threshold`):** A significant positive gain indicates a fertile environment where the Seed's resonance will be amplified. The Gambit transitions to an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) with the substrate. The Seed commits its resources to germination, establishing a deep and lasting Wound Channel that becomes the foundation of a new, stable structure.

-   **HOLD (`S_p` â‰ˆ 0 OR High Turbulence):** A near-zero gain, or a probe that generates excessive turbulence, signals a marginal or volatile environment. The path of wisdom is to wait. The shallow Wound Channel of the probe remains as a latent "path memory," allowing the Seed to re-evaluate with greater efficiency should conditions change.

-   **ABORT (`S_p` < 0):** A negative gain is a definitive prediction of decoherence. The environmental cost exceeds the Seed's ability to maintain its own coherence. To proceed would be an act of self-destruction. The Seed retreats, preserving its integrity for a more harmonious opportunity.
