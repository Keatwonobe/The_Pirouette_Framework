The gut-brain axis is a masterclass in this principle. A healthy microbiome is a symphony of Alchemical Unions (`CORE-012`) producing a spectrum of coherent signals. The keystone of these is Butyrate, a high-coherence, high-information signal (`CORE-013`) that is not merely a nutrient, but a current of pure instruction that harmonizes the entire system.

1.  **It Restores the Arena:** Butyrate is the primary fuel for the cells of the gut lining. Its presence reinforces the biological expression of the **Gladiator Force (CORE-008)**, sealing the barriers that prevent the chaos of the external world from becoming the turbulence of the internal.
2.  **It Calms the Turbulence:** By crossing the blood-brain barrier, it acts as a harmonizing signal, calming the **Turbulent Flow** of neuroinflammation and reducing the systemic friction that is often a secondary symptom of the primary stagnation.
3.  **It Reinforces the Channel of Health:** As an HDAC inhibitor, Butyrate directly influences gene expression. It reinforces the **Wound Channel (CORE-011)** for healthy cellular function, reminding neurons of their proper Ki pattern and promoting repair, growth, and resilience.

The chronic absence of the Butyrate current is a profound silence that allows the entire system to descend into dissonance.
