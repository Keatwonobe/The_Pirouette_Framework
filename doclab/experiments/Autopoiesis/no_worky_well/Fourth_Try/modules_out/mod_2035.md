The foundation of this discovery is the Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law, which posits that the absolute mass of each neutrino mass eigenstate (m_i) is not an intrinsic property, but an emergent one, governed by a geometric relationship between a base mass scale and the state's structural properties.

The Law:
$$ m_i = \mu_\nu; \left(\frac{\mathrm{PR}_i}{3}\right)^{p}; \left(\mathrm{Purity}_i\right)^{q} $$

Where:

μ_ν (Base Mass Scale): A fundamental mass parameter for the neutrino sector, representing the baseline energy scale.

p (Participation Exponent): A dimensionless exponent governing how a state's mass is scaled by its "Participation Ratio" (PR).

q (Purity Exponent): A dimensionless exponent governing how a state's mass is scaled by its "Purity."

Purity_i = max_α |U_{αi}|^2: Measures how strongly a mass state i is aligned with a single flavor state α. A "pure" state is dominated by one flavor.

PR_i = (∑_α |U_{αi}|^4)^-1: The Participation Ratio, a measure of how many flavor states a given mass state "participates" in. It is a measure of a state's "mixedness."

This law proposes that a neutrino's mass is a direct consequence of its internal geometry, as described by the mixing matrix U.
