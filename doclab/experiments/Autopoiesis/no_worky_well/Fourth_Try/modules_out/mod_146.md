# CORE-015 â€” The Predictive Fractal (PRG) & Coherence-Centric AI

**Status:** Draft for review
**Supersedes/Related:** CORE-014, MATH-011v3, MATH-012v2, MATH-014v2, XXP-015v2
**Purpose:** Formalize the Pirouette Renormalization Group (PRG) as the fractal at the heart of time and lay down an AI design that *optimizes coherence across scales* using PRG supervision.
