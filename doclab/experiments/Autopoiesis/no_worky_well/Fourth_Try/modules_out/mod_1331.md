A phase shift is the system's solution to an unsustainable state. It is a direct consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, preceded by a quantifiable departure from stability driven by two coupled factors:

1.  **Mounting Temporal Pressure (Γ):** The chaotic, dissonant energy of the system's environment. A high-Γ environment is a storm of interfering temporal rhythms that constantly tests the integrity of the system's song, raising the energetic cost of maintaining its current form (`Ki_old`).

2.  **Rising Coherence Stress (σ_K):** The system's internal dissonance. This is a measure of how far the system's actual state has deviated from its ideal, maximally coherent Ki pattern. It is the strain on the thread of its own being, a measure of its internal contradictions and inefficiencies.

As these two forces intensify, the system's Time Adherence (`Tₐ`) begins to fail. It enters a state of **Turbulent Flow** (DYN-001), characterized by internal chaos and wasted energy. At a tipping point, the system abandons its failing resonance and executes the cascade, a jump across its coherence manifold to a new, more stable pattern.
