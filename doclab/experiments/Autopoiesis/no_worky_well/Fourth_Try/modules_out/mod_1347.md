Any adaptive system can be described by four components, viewed not as mechanical parts, but as features of a dynamic, coherence-seeking whole.

1.  **The Weaver (The System):** The entity being guided. It possesses a dynamic, resonant pattern of identity, its **Ki**. Its natural state is to persist in this resonance.

2.  **The North Star (The Goal State):** A target state of resonance, a desired `Ki_goal`. This goal state acts as a **Coherence Attractor**, projecting a **Shadow (CORE-010)** onto the system's manifold and creating a template for what "should be."

3.  **The Dissonance (The Error Signal):** The measured difference between the **Echo** of the system's current state and the Shadow of the goal state. This dissonance is not just data; it is a source of internal **Temporal Pressure (Î“)** that creates instability and demands resolution. It is the feeling of being "off-key."

4.  **The Rudder (The Corrective Action):** The mechanism by which the Weaver alters its own internal dynamics to modify its `Ki`, with the intent of reducing the dissonance.
