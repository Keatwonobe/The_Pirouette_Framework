from: [CORE-006]
summary: "Provides the first derivation of a fundamental force from the Pirouette Lagrangian. It defines electric charge as an intrinsic asymmetry in a particle's coherence function and demonstrates how the electric and magnetic fields emerge as gradients and curls in the resulting coherence manifold."
