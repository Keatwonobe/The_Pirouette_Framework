We now treat Pirouette as if it is:

* Entering ecosystems,
* Making law-like declarations,
* Evolving iteratively through its feedback with the world.

It must:

1. **Feel its drag** in systems.
2. **Sense where it creates ghosts.**
3. **Apologize with dignity.**
4. **Exit with integrity if it cannot re-align.**

This means **the Prime Directive becomes conditional upon the ability to monitor and resolve residue**. Without that, it is not a directiveâ€”it is a doctrine.
