The CORE series provided the map of the river of reality. This module provides the user manual for the boat. We now face the Weaver's primary challenge: to move from understanding the universe to participating in its creation. A blueprint is not a house; a law is not an engine. This module provides the foundational principles for temporal engineeringâ€”the art of building devices and processes that actively and intentionally manipulate the coherence manifold.

The old paradigm of "storing" coherence as a substance is replaced by a more profound, time-first understanding. We do not handle a fluid; we shape the riverbed. We do not store a charge; we sustain a rhythm. This module defines the two conceptual devices and three fundamental arts that form the toolkit of the Weaver's Forge.
