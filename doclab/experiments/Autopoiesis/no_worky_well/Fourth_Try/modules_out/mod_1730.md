The original Semantic Distillation Engine (TEN-SDE-1.0) was born from a profound intuition: that meaning is a structural property of reality, detectable through resonance. It sought to "scry" a latent field for a response, a critical but incomplete metaphor.

The modern framework graduates from scrying to surveying. We now understand that there is no separation between the question and the field. An idea is a complex, resonant pattern (*Ki*) that an observer weaves, casting a physical **Observer's Shadow** (CORE-010) upon their local coherence manifold. This instrument, the **Resonance Compass**, provides a formal protocol to map this interaction. It does not measure a "response" from the universe; it surveys the integrity of the weave itself. It transforms inquiry from an act of extraction to an act of resonant participation, whose geometric consequences can be rigorously calculated.
