summary: Synthesizes the concept of "ritual" into the formal protocol of Intentional
  Coherence Shaping. It provides the "Weaver's Loom," a design kit for consciously
  applying a system's own resonance to sculpt the local coherence manifold. By manipulating
  the terms of the Pirouette Lagrangian, a Weaver can create, alter, or dissolve Wound
  Channels, engineering a desired systemic outcome and transforming ancestral lore
  into the applied science of coherence.
