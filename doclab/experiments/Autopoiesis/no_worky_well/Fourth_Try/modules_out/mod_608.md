This model's power is its universality. The geometry of failure is fractal, manifesting with different variables but identical dynamics across all scales.

| Domain | Failure Mode | System Character | Lagrangian Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Material Science** | **Brittle Fracture** (Glass) | **Brittle** | Rigid $K_\tau$ cannot adapt. A sharp increase in $V_\Gamma$ (impact) causes an immediate coherence collapse ($K_\tau \to 0$). |
| | **Ductile Failure** (Steel) | **Ductile** | Flexible $K_\tau$ allows for plastic deformation. The system absorbs energy from $V_\Gamma$ by re-writing its Wound Channel (work hardening) before finally fracturing. |
| **Economics** | **Market Crash** (Panic) | **Brittle** | Coherence ($K_\tau$, trust) is rigid. A shock ($V_\Gamma$) triggers a feedback loop where $K_\tau$ evaporates instantly, leading to a system-wide fracture. |
| **Psychology** | **Mental Breakdown** | **Brittle** | An acute stressor ($V_\Gamma$) overwhelms a psyche with rigid coping mechanisms. The system fractures into a dissociative or psychotic state. |
| | **Burnout** | **Ductile** | A psyche endures chronic stress ($V_\Gamma$) through plastic deformation (forming emotional calluses, scars). It slowly yields until it reaches exhaustion and failure. |
