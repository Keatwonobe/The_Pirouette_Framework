summary: Models bifurcation events as 'watershed moments' where a system's single
  path of maximal coherence splits. It reframes this critical choice as a 'coherence
  crisis' driven by temporal pressure, resulting in the partitioning of the system's
  Wound Channel and the divergence of its future paths.
