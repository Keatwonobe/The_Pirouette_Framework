Analyzing a system for its underlying grammar is a three-step process:

1.  **Identify the Channel**: Locate the system or data stream exhibiting potential self-similarity. This could be the structure of a network, the fluctuations of a market, or the branching of a decision tree.

2.  **Measure the Signatures**: Apply computational methods (e.g., Box-Counting, Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis) to the data to quantify the three core signatures: its Coherence Complexity `(D_f)`, its Inter-Scale Coherence `(T_a_scale)`, and its Generative Rhythm `(ω_g)`.

3.  **Correlate with the Lagrangian**: Analyze how these signatures relate to the system's broader state. Why is this specific fractal the most efficient solution? How does the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) of the environment influence the pattern's final complexity and fidelity? This step maps the measured pattern back to the fundamental 'why' of its existence.
