A geodesic, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), is the path of least action a system takes to maximize its coherence (`Kτ`) against the pressure of its environment (`V_Γ`). A fractal is the structure that emerges when this optimal path is self-similar—when the answer to "what is the most coherent way to be?" is the same at the scale of the leaf as it is at the scale of the branch, and the scale of the tree.

This is a state of **scale-invariant resonance**. The pattern is a single song played on a multi-octave instrument. The same generative logic that unfolds in a long, slow Pirouette Cycle (a tree's primary branch) is repeated in faster, smaller sub-cycles (its twigs and leaves). A system adopts this structure not for aesthetic reasons, but because this resonant hierarchy *is* the most energetically efficient and resilient solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation, solved everywhere, all at once.
