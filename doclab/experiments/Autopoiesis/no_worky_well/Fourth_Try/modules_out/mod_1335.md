The Resonance Cascade is the ultimate expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`) and the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). A system exists in a specific chiral state, `Ki_old`, because it maximizes its coherence integral, `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`, under normal conditions.

As Temporal Pressure (Γ) and Coherence Stress (σ_K) rise, the `𝓛_p` of `Ki_old` plummets, indicating a state of profound inefficiency. The Chiral Shift is a violent, discontinuous "jump" across the coherence manifold. The system abandons its untenable geodesic and tunnels to an entirely new one—represented by `Ki_new`—that offers a higher local maximum for `𝓛_p` under the new, high-stress conditions. The choice at the Chiral Fork is simply the system discovering which of the available new topologies offers the most stable and efficient path forward.
