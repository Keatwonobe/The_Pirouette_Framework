The curvature of the Coherence Manifold is not arbitrary; it is determined by the interactions available to the system. We can now create a direct "dictionary" linking physical phenomena to geometric properties.

Propagating Forces (e.g., Electromagnetism): Manifest as regions of non-zero sectional curvature. The sign of the curvature determines whether nearby geodesics converge (attraction) or diverge (repulsion).

Confinement (The Gladiator Force): Is not a property of curvature, but of the manifold's topology and completeness. A confining potential corresponds to a manifold where the distance to the "boundary" is infinite, preventing any finite-energy geodesic from ever reaching it.

Conservation Laws: Correspond to Killing vector fields on the manifoldâ€”directions in which one can move without changing the metric. Symmetries in the geometry give rise to conserved quantities (Noether's Theorem).
