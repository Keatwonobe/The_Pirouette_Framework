Before a rupture, a system exists in a state of immense potential, a promise of violence held in perfect stillness. In the language of the framework, it is held in a deep "coherence well" by the Gladiator Force (CORE-008), which manifests as an overwhelming Temporal Pressure, `V_Γ`.

The system's Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, is massively negative, as `V_Γ >> K_τ`.

-   **High Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`):** The "cost" of deviating from the confined state is astronomically high. The system is forced into a path of stillness and resistance, accumulating a vast "coherence debt." It is a drawn bowstring.
-   **Static Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`):** The system possesses a high degree of internal coherence, but it is static and potential. Its pattern is stable and predictable, but it is the predictability of a crystal, not a current.

In this state, any small perturbation is immediately dampened. The system is stable, silent, and storing a formidable amount of potential resonance.
