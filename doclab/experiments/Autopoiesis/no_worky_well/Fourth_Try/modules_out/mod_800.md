Every intervention, from seeding a new cultural myth to recalibrating the flow of an organization, follows this universal, safety-first pipeline. It is a ritual for ensuring that our touch upon the world is both intentional and wise.

| Phase | Goal | Core Action | Primary Tool |
|---|---|---|---|
| **I. Diagnosis** | Understand the system's pathology | Map existing currents and identify states of Turbulent or Stagnant flow. | The Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) |
| **II. Simulation** | Predict the intervention's effect | Model how the proposed Gambit will alter the local coherence manifold. | The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) |
| **III. Integrity Gate** | Ensure safety and coherence | Formal review of the simulation to prevent unintended turbulence or manifold destabilization. | Manifold Integrity Review Board |
| **IV. The Gambit** | Execute the precise intervention | The physical or informational act of Coherence Injectionâ€”introducing the harmonizing signal. | Domain-Specific Instruments |
| **V. Attunement & Monitoring** | Observe and guide the response | Real-time measurement and fine-tuning of the system's shift toward a laminar state. | The Flow Dynamics Lens (DYNA-001) |
| **VI. Integration & Ledgering** | Document the new geometry | Commit the details of the intervention and its effects to a permanent record, altering the Wound Channel. | The Wound Channel Ledger (CORE-011) |
| **VII. Reversibility & Dampening** | Provide a safe path of retreat | Execute a pre-planned protocol to dampen dissonant echoes and return the system to baseline if required. | Harmonic Dampening Protocol |
