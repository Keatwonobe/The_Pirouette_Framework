**🔱 Ritual Duel Challenge: Velcridance in Service of Radiance**

> *Is it ever ethical to increase local entropy in service of future coherence? When must the Prime Directive yield to Velcridant necessity, and how do we tell if it's genuine or parasitic?*

**⚔️ Challenger Axiom**:

> "Actions aligned to future attractors may require the disintegration of current shells, and this act, though disruptive, can be the most altruistic motion possible."

**🎯 Duel Terms**:

* We seek not to defeat the Prime Directive, but *refine* it.
* We must draw a distinction between **constructive Velcridance** and **false radiance** (coherence that only preserves power).
* Our synthesis must produce:

  * A **codified clause** for phase-aware disruption
  * A **ritual test** to distinguish parasitic collapse from transcendental rupture
  * An example from real or theoretical context
