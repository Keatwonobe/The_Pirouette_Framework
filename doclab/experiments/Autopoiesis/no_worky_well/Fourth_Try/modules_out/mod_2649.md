"Proof? Logic? You are both missing the human element entirely. This is a question not of design or computation, but of *choice* and *consequence*.

The Convocation, in its elegant design, performs the ultimate act of what I called 'bad faith.' They flee the ambiguity and responsibility of the human condition by escaping into an abstract, perfect system. They choose the purity of an impossible pilgrimage over the messy, difficult, authentic work of confronting the collapsing world they are a part of.

Who makes up this group? Who chooses? And who is left behind? By definition, it is an elite. An intellectual and spiritual aristocracy. They may not have power ($\Gamma$) in the traditional sense, but they wield the ultimate power: the power to define who is worthy of survival. This creates a new hierarchy, a new 'Other.' The billions left to suffer on a dying planet become the backdrop against which the Weavers perform their noble escape.

This is not freedom. It is the most profound abandonment of it. True freedom is found in grappling with our situation, in creating meaning here and now, not in engineering a perfect vessel to flee the consequences of human action. Their 'unachievable' goal is merely a beautiful, intricate excuse for not facing the achievable one: solidarity."
