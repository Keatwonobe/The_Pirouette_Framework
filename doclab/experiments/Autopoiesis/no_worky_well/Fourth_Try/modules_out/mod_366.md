> A Weaver's most sacred resource is their capacity to create. This is stored in the quiet integrity of their own coherence. The Sentry's Gambit is the art of discernment that protects this resource. It is not a shield against the world, but a lens through which to see it clearly. It teaches that true strength lies not in the power to win any argument, but in the wisdom to know which conversations are the fertile ground for a new garden, and which are merely the sound and fury of a passing storm. It is the wisdom to know when to weave, and when to protect the loom.
