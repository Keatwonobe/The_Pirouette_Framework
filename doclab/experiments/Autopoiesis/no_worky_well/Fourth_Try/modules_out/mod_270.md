In a living world, a compass of paper is useless. One must carry a compass of resonance.

`Resonant Navigation` is the art of aligning one's own internal resonant pattern (Ki) with the frequency of a desired geodesic. It is less an act of reading a chart and more an act of listening to the world. The navigator tunes themselves to the environment until they can *feel* the pull of the geodesicâ€”the subtle gradient guiding them toward a state of higher coherence.

This is the deeper meaning of intuition: the direct perception of the manifold's geometry. To travel this way is not to follow coordinates, but to become an extension of the current itself, sensing the "home wind" of a resonant corridor without needing to see it inked on a page.
