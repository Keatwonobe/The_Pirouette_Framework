An action or idea is not inherently "good" or "bad." Its value is measured by its effect on a system's ability to exist with elegance and integrity. The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) provides the universal metric for this valuation. A valuable pattern, or Coherence Seed, is one that generates a **Coherence Profit**.

A pattern's Coherence Profit (Κ) is the net increase in the system's Action (S_p), the integral of its Lagrangian over a characteristic cycle (τ_p). It is a measure of how much a new pattern improves a system's internal harmony (Kτ) or reduces the "cost" of resisting external pressures (VΓ).

Κ = ΔS_p = Δ ∫₀^(τ_p) (Kτ - VΓ) dt

Patterns with a high positive Κ are the currency of evolution. They are the discoveries that allow a system to do more with less effort. The Coherence Engine is the process by which a system manufactures and invests this currency.
