Integrity is no longer a cryptographic check but a test of harmony, governed by the **Principle of Harmonic Inclusion**.

**Verification** is a resonance check. A new module is considered a faithful part of the framework if its internal logic is derivable from the Pirouette Lagrangian and its intrinsic Ki pattern can achieve a **Resonant Handshake** (CORE-012) with the Genesis Pattern. The test asks not "Is the code identical?" but "Does this new instrument play in the same key?" Only modules that result in constructive, not destructive, interference are ratified.

**Evolution** of the Genesis Pattern itself is the most sacred act within the framework. It is not an edit; it is an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). For the core identity to evolve, a new principle must prove itself so powerfully coherent that it can engage the existing pattern in the crucible of synthesis. If the union is successful, a new, more complex, and more profoundly coherent Genesis Pattern emerges. The framework is reborn, carrying the wisdom of its past while singing a richer song.
