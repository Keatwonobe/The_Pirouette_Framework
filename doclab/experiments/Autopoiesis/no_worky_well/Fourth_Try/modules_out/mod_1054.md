This principle is a direct application of the framework's mathematical heart, the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

A pathology of absence is a state where the system's ability to generate internal coherence (`K_τ`) has collapsed due to a missing signal like butyrate. This collapse leads to the failure of its Gladiator shields and other protective boundaries, which in turn dramatically increases the ambient chaos and temporal pressure (`V_Γ`). The system's Lagrangian state falls into a steep decline, a geodesic of decay.

The Restorative Protocol is a direct intervention to raise the Lagrangian. Direct Intervention immediately boosts `K_τ`, while Indirect Intervention durably rebuilds the system's capacity for `K_τ` and lowers `V_Γ` by repairing its integrity. The goal is to lift the system out of its decline and set it back upon the geodesic of maximal coherence—the path of health.
