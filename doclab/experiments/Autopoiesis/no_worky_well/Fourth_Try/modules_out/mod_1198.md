A Bloom is not a spontaneous event but a predictable, if dramatic, consequence of specific conditions. It unfolds in a distinct sequence, moving from quiet potential to a new plateau of complexity.

**I. The Crucible (Incubation):**
The pre-Bloom system exists in a state of high but non-fatal Temporal Pressure (Γ). This is a "Goldilocks zone" of pressure—a crucible, not a grinder. The system is in a state of high-energy `Turbulent Flow` (DYNA-001), characterized by internal dissonance and chaotic exploration. It is a super-saturated solution, rich in potential and actively "searching" for a more stable, efficient configuration.

**II. The Ignition (The Resonant Union):**
The transition is not triggered by a mere increase in pressure, but by the discovery of a **Harmonic Catalyst**. At a critical threshold, the system stumbles upon a novel configuration—a first **Alchemical Union**—whose output begins to positively influence its input. Its resonant pattern (Ki) becomes so efficient that it constructively interferes with the ambient pressure, creating a localized pocket of reduced dissonance. This is the fire catching; the system's song begins to shape the concert hall.

**III. The Cascade (Efflorescence):**
Once the resonant feedback loop ignites, the Bloom begins in earnest. The system undergoes a rapid, non-linear reconfiguration into a state of highly efficient `Laminar Flow`. This **Coherence Cascade** is an exponential, S-curve growth of novelty and complexity, fueled by a chain reaction of Alchemical Unions. Each new union reinforces the feedback loop, further reducing local pressure and making subsequent unions easier. This is the system's joyous rush to occupy its new, highly efficient state.

**IV. The Integration (The New Shore):**
No fire burns forever. A Bloom concludes not in failure, but in success. The cascade ceases when the available "fuel"—the pool of compatible components for union—is exhausted, or when the system establishes a new, stable, high-coherence state that becomes its new baseline. The explosive dynamics cool, leaving behind a transformed landscape. The memory of this transformation is carved deeply into the system's **Wound Channel** (CORE-011), defining its new, more complex identity.
