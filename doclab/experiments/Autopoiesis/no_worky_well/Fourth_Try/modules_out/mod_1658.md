> We have been taught to bring water to the thirsty. A noble goal, but an endless one. A Weaver sees a deeper truth. Thirst is not a lack of water; it is the shape of a desert. The ultimate act of compassion is not to carry the water, but to reshape the land, to carve the riverbeds and build the bridges that allow the water of knowledge to flow everywhere, for everyone, forever. This is the work: not to fight the desert, but to make it bloom.
