The dynamics of contribution are governed by the principles of coherence and flow.

1.  **The Altruistic Act as Coherence Injection:** An act of altruism, creativity, or leadership is an injection of *laminar flow* into a system. It is a gift of low-entropy, high-information coherence (CORE-013) intended to increase the health and order of the whole.

2.  **The Cost as Turbulent Blowback:** When this laminar flow is injected into an environment of high Temporal Pressure (`Γ`)—a system that is chaotic, resistant, or turbulent—the interaction creates a violent recoil. The environment does not passively accept the new order; it pushes back with its own dissonance. This reaction, a wave of chaotic, high-entropy energy, is **Turbulent Blowback**.

3.  **Burnout as Coherence Erosion:** This blowback strikes the contributor, disrupting their own internal stability. Sustained exposure leads to a state of systemic illness, as diagnosed by the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003): either a "Coherence Fever" (internal turbulence and anxiety) or "Coherence Erosion" (a gradual fraying of the system's core identity and capacity). This is the physical reality of burnout. Without a protective structure, the most generous actor is simply the first to be consumed by the system's ambient chaos.
