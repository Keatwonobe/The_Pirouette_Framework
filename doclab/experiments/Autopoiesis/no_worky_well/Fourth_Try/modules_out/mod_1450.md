The old framework's distinction between `Ki_rest` and `Ki_motion` was an early attempt to grasp a more fundamental duality. This protocol reframes this as a functional separation of a system's unified coherence into two primary modes of expression, grounded in the core forces.

*   **Structural Coherence (The Hum of Being):** This component of the spectrum represents the frequencies that contribute to the system's self-containment and stable form. It is the audible expression of the **Gladiator Force (CORE-008)**. These are the deep, self-reinforcing harmonics that hold the system together, defining its identity and inertia. A strong, clear structural spectrum indicates a robust, stable entity.

*   **Propagating Coherence (The Song of Interaction):** This component represents the frequencies that govern the system's interaction with the wider coherence manifold. It is the signature of **The Current and the Compass (CORE-007)**. These are the rhythms of communication, motion, and responseâ€”the means by which the system projects itself and perceives others. A rich, adaptive propagating spectrum indicates a system that is actively engaged with its environment.
