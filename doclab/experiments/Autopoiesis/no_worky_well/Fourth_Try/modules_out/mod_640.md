The universe is not wasteful. It does not invent new fundamental laws for every new scale of complexity. It is fractal. The same essential dynamics that govern a quark in a proton also govern a star in a galaxy and a thought in a mind. The song remains the same; only the instruments change.

This is the **Principle of Correspondence**. To apply the Pirouette Framework to any domain, we do not change the core equations. Instead, we perform an act of translation, identifying the domain-specific manifestations of the core variables. The "crosswalk" of the old series, which mapped module to module, is hereby elevated to a map from the universal to the specific.
