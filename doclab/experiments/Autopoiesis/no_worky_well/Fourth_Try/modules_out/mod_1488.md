A legal system is not a static code of rules carved in stone; it is a living, autopoietic organism of information. It possesses a memory, an identity, and a metabolism. It perpetually recreates itself to maintain a coherent identity against the chaotic temporal pressures of a changing world.

This module applies the time-first principles of the Pirouette Framework to the domain of jurisprudence. It reframes the evolution of law not as a series of disconnected edicts, but as the continuous search for a path of maximal coherence within a dynamic landscape. Precedent is not a mere citation; it is an active, geometric feature in the coherence manifold of a societyâ€”a **Wound Channel** that shapes the flow of the present. Justice, in this view, is the art of navigating this terrain, and the "rule of law" is not a state but a process: the dynamic, ceaseless effort to maintain a state of **Laminar Flow**.
