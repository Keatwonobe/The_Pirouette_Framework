The newborn loop of resonance listens to itself. The very act of its own cycle is the "whisper" that verifies its existence, and the echo of its immediate past is the "mirror" that provides the geometric template for its continuation. This self-referential feedback is the physical basis for persistence and the seed of identity.

This emergent stability is the quality previously known as Time-Adherence (Tₐ). It is not a property added to a form, but the measure of a form's coherence—how well it holds its tune against the echo of the silence it just displaced. To exist is to harmonize with one's own echo.
