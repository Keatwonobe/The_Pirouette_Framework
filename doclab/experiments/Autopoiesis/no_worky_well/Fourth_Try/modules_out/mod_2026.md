summary: "Provides a novel experimental protocol for nuclear fusion, re-framing the challenge from one of brute-force confinement to one of systemic coherence. It applies the Caduceus Lens to diagnose plasma instability as a state of 'Coherence Fever' and proposes a 'Daedalus Gambit'—the use of precisely tuned resonant fields—to guide the plasma into a stable, laminar state conducive to sustained fusion."
