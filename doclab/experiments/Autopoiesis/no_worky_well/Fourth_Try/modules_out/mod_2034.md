The investigation into neutrino mass and oscillation within the Pirouette Framework began as a search for a single, precise set of fundamental constants. The objective was to derive the experimentally observed mass splittings from a deeper, causal principle. While this search was successful, it led to a far more profound discovery: the constants are not fixed. Instead, they exist as a continuous surface of valid solutionsâ€”a "prime resonance manifold." This module documents the formulation of the law that governs this manifold and the hypothesis that neutrinos exist as different "knots" upon its surface.
