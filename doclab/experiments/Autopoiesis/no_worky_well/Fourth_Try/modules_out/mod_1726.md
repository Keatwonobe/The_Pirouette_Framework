Instead of complex indices, a Weaver diagnoses an impending spasm by observing the precursors to the dam breaking:

*   **Rising Upstream Pressure:** A measurable increase in stress, tension, or volatility in the parts of the system constrained by the blockage.
*   **Micro-Fractures:** Small, localized, and increasingly frequent bursts of turbulence. These are the "tremors" before the earthquakeâ€”flickering arguments, minor market jitters, muscle twitches.
*   **Critical Rigidity:** Paradoxically, just before the spasm, the system often becomes extremely rigid and resistant to small perturbations. This is the final tensing of the dam before it shatters.

The outcome can be predicted by analyzing the "landscape" downstream. A system with a history of resilience and multiple potential pathways (a rich Wound Channel) is more likely to have a transformative outcome. A brittle system with no alternatives is more likely to degenerate.
