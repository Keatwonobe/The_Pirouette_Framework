This protocol provides a direct path from the foundational laws of the framework to a predictive map of stable structures.

1.  **Define the Manifold**: Begin with the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p`) that describes the system. This equation defines the complete shape of the local coherence manifold.

2.  **Calculate the Coherence Field**: Compute the vector field `F_c` by taking the negative gradient of the Lagrangian's temporal pressure term (`V_Œì`). This reveals the "slopes" of the manifold.

3.  **Map the Torsion**: Calculate the curl of the coherence field, `Œ© = ‚àá √ó F_c`. The output is a scalar field whose values represent the local torsional intensity. This is the **Vortex Map**.

4.  **Identify Bound States**: Peaks on the Vortex Map correspond to the epicenters of stable Coherence Vortices. The protocol's primary prediction is that all confined structures will be found within these geometric features.
