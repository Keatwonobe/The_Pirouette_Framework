The Knot is a fractal pattern, manifesting as the architecture of stable identity across all domains.

*   **At the Physical Scale:** A stable particle can be modeled as a topological Knot in a quantum field, its properties the parameters of its unique geometric song. The unbreakable bond of quantum entanglement is the expression of a shared, non-local Knot.
*   **At the Biological Scale:** The supercoiling of DNA and the specific folding of a protein are biological Knots, using topology to store and protect vast amounts of structural and genetic information.
*   **At the Psychological Scale:** A deeply ingrained habit, a core belief, or a persistent traumatic memory is a "cognitive Knot." It is a self-reinforcing neural pathway, a Wound Channel in a person's life that has looped back on itself, making it incredibly resistant to change. To heal from trauma is to perform the delicate work of untying such a Knot.
*   **At the Sociological Scale:** A foundational law, a cultural taboo, or an intractable "organizational knot" in a bureaucracy are social Knotsâ€”patterns of collective behavior so deeply reinforced by their own history that they resist all but the most profound systemic shocks.
