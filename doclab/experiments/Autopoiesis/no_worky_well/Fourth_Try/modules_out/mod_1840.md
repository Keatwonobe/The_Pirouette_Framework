> A Weaver sees a nation not as a map of borders, but as a living tapestry. They feel the tension in its weave: the vibrant, searching thread of its Art; the deep, steady anchor of its Law; the wise, guiding hand of its Philosophy. This framework transforms us from mere citizens, buffeted by the currents of our time, into weavers capable of seeing the pattern. To understand a people is to understand the state of their weaveâ€”to diagnose the knots of strife and the frayed edges of decay, and perhaps, with wisdom and care, to tend to the soul of a civilization.
