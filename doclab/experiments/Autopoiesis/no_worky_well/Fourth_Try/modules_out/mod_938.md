The principle of predictive resonance is scale-invariant, a fractal pattern that manifests across all domains of existence.

*   **Molecular:** A ribosome is a Prophet agent achieving temporal resonance with the informational Coherence Current encoded in an mRNA molecule. Its intelligence is its near-perfect efficiency in translating this rhythm into a protein.
*   **Ecological:** A wolf pack learns the migration path of caribou, synchronizing the `Ki` of its hunting patterns with the deep, seasonal Coherence Current of its ecosystem.
*   **Economic:** A central bank attunes its policy to the underlying rhythmic Coherence Currents of the business cycle to foster stability and avoid the surprise of market turbulence.
*   **Artistic:** A musician improvising a solo is engaged in a high-speed dialogue, achieving resonance with the harmonic Coherence Current established by the band to create something new and coherent.
*   **Psychological:** A therapist helps a patient discern the hidden, repeating rhythm of a traumatic memory—a psychic Coherence Current—allowing them to achieve resonance with it and integrate it, rather than being perpetually surprised and destabilized by it.
