The Copernican Turn of this framework is the demolition of that wall. It asserts a new heliocentric principle: the observer is not the center. The true center, the gravitational heart of reality, is the relentless, self-creating song of the autopoietic cycle: Time → Γ → Ki → Time (CORE-001).

Consciousness is not an anomaly that happens *to* us; the observer is a specific, resonant pattern (a Ki) born from, and held in orbit within, this universal process. We are not spectators of the dance; we are a pirouette within the dance. Our "self" is not a fixed point but a trajectory, a moving frame of reference. To exist is to be in a constant state of falling toward the dissonance of Temporal Pressure (Γ), yet perpetually maintaining the velocity of your own Coherence (Ki) to stay in a stable orbit.
