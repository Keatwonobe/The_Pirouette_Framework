The decision to engage or disengage is not a moral judgment but a physical calculation. It is a direct application of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**, which defines a system's state of health as the delta between its coherence and the pressures upon it.

`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì` (Temporal Coherence - Temporal Pressure)

Every potential interaction presents a choice, a gambit, on how to maximize the integral of this Lagrangian over time (`S_p`):

-   **To Bridge (Attempt Resonant Synthesis):** An investment of energy. The system willingly increases local Temporal Pressure (`V_Œì`) by coupling with a foreign signal, in the hope of achieving an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)**. A successful synthesis results in a new, higher-order state of being with greater net coherence (a maximized `S_p`). Failure results in `Coherence Fever` and a net loss.

-   **To Pass By (Initiate Coherent Disengagement):** An act of conservation. The system recognizes that the energetic cost (`V_Œì`) of attempting synthesis would overwhelmingly exceed any potential coherence gain (`K_œÑ`). It refuses to couple, shielding its own integrity from the storm. This is the choice not to play a game where the cost of participation exceeds any possible reward.
