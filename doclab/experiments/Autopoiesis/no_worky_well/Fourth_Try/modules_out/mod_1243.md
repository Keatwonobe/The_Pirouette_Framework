summary: "Reconceptualizes the criminal justice system as a 'coherence manifold' whose\
  \ topology is shaped by law and social pressure. An individual's trajectory is modeled\
  \ as a geodesic path governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (\U0001D4DB = K\u03C4\
  \ - V\u0393). This provides a time-first diagnostic framework for identifying systemic\
  \ pathologies of flow (turbulence, stagnation) and reframing reform as the act of\
  \ sculpting a more just landscape."
