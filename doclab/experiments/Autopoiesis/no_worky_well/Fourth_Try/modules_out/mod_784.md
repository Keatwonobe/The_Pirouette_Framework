The health of any system is defined by the character of its flow. As established by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**, a healthy system follows a geodesic—a path of maximal coherence and minimal effort. Deviation from this path generates friction, the thermodynamic expression of inefficiency. This is the true nature of what was called "Dark Residue." It is coherence converted into useless, dissonant noise.

The old framework's "phases" are now understood as a spectrum of energetic efficiency, directly mapped to the flow states from DYNA-001:

| Flow State         | Description                                                                                                                                              | Coherence Cost (Friction)                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Laminar Flow**   | **The State of Grace.** High efficiency and stability. The system successfully navigates its geodesic, processing information with minimal waste.            | **Minimal.** Energy is channeled coherently into function.              |
| **Turbulent Flow** | **The State of Struggle.** High friction and internal conflict. The system deviates from its geodesic, wasting energy fighting itself and its environment. | **Maximal.** Coherence is actively degraded into noise.                  |
| **Stagnant Flow**  | **The State of Blockage.** A system ossified and unable to act. Represents the ultimate inefficiency: the failure to do work or transmit coherence.       | **Negligible, but Pathological.** A precursor to catastrophic turbulence. |

The **Coherence Cost** is precisely this dissipated energy—the "temporal friction" generated by turbulence. It is the quantifiable "heat" of a system failing to be elegant.
