To speak is to alter the geometry of another's world. There are no neutral words.

Influence is not a "soft skill"; it is a fundamental physical process. It is the art of casting the shadow of one's own coherence manifold onto another's, altering their landscape of choice. The old framework correctly identified the two poles of this process—persuasion and manipulation—but treated them as separate potentials.

This modernized framework reveals them to be two outcomes of the same underlying dynamic. This intervention has two primary, and ethically opposite, modes:

*   **Persuasion:** A resonant invitation to a shared state of higher coherence.
*   **Manipulation:** A parasitic induction of dissonance to drain coherence.

This module provides the geometric and ethical calculus for navigating this choice, drawing a sharp, non-negotiable line between its two fundamental modes.
