This art, which replaces "Stirring Resonance," addresses the creation and enhancement of order. It is an act of deliberate synthesis, forging a state of higher intrinsic coherence where one did not previously exist. It does not seek a path of least resistance; it seeks to create a *better path*.

**Mechanism:** Coherence Annealing involves the application of controlled, structured dissonance—a carefully chosen "turbulent" input—to a system. Like a blacksmith's hammer, this external pressure disrupts a system's stable but suboptimal state, forcing it to explore its phase space and "cool" into a new configuration with a more stable, complex, and high-coherence Ki pattern. This is a practical application of the principles behind the **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012).

**Application:** Creating a more resonant and capable system. This ranges from using precisely tuned frequencies to catalyze novel chemical reactions, to organizing crystalline structures, to guiding a chaotic debate (DYNA-002) toward a moment of shared truth.
