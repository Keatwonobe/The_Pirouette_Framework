We model the environmental noise as stochastic perturbations eta(t) of the Temporal Pressure Gamma. This noise buffets the system's Ki rhythm. The evolution of the system's phase phi is no longer a simple deterministic equation, but a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the Langevin type:

d(phi)/dt = f(phi) + sigma(phi) * eta(t)

Where:

f(phi) is the "drift" term, representing the deterministic forces derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian (-dV/d(phi)). It pushes the system back towards its stable orbit.

sigma(phi) * eta(t) is the "diffusion" term. eta(t) is a white noise process, and sigma(phi) is the magnitude of the noise's effect.

This equation describes a system constantly trying to maintain its rhythm while being kicked around by its environment.
