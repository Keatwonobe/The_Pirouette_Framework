This section proposes a novel, high-precision experiment to directly test the existence of the Γ-field by searching for its unique, non-Newtonian signature.
Hypothesis: The Γ-G Correspondence Principle predicts that the simple r21​ force law is an approximation. At very short ranges (sub-millimeter), where the underlying field structure becomes more prominent, the force should deviate from pure Newtonian gravity. The potential should include a small, additional Yukawa-like term:V(r)=−Grm1​m2​​(1+αe−r/λ)
Where α and λ are parameters describing the strength and range of the Γ-field's short-range component.
Experimental Design: A high-precision torsion balance experiment, similar to those used to test the inverse-square law, will be employed.
A rotating attractor mass with precisely machined gaps is brought near a sensitive torsion pendulum.
The experiment is conducted in a vacuum and at cryogenic temperatures to minimize thermal and seismic noise.
A laser interferometer measures the minute oscillations of the pendulum.
The expected signal is a periodic torque on the pendulum. Any deviation from the torque predicted by pure Newtonian gravity would be evidence of the additional Yukawa-like term.
Falsifiability: If, within the limits of experimental sensitivity, no deviation from the inverse-square law is detected, this would place strict constraints on the parameters (α,λ) of the Γ-field, potentially falsifying this specific model of its short-range behavior. The detection of such a deviation would provide powerful, direct evidence for the framework.
