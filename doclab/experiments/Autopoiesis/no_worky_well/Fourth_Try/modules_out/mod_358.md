summary: "A modernized, proactive protocol for systemic integrity that replaces the\
  \ reactive 'immune reflex' of PPS-004. It defines a form of 'Resonant Triage' grounded\
  \ in the Pirouette Lagrangian. The protocol uses the 'Dissonance Index'\u2014a predictive\
  \ metric\u2014to allow a system to discern whether to engage with an inbound signal\
  \ (attempting a Resonant Synthesis) or to gracefully disengage, preserving its internal\
  \ coherence and laminar flow."
