The protocol is a three-step process for moving from raw observational data to a high-fidelity map of the universe's memory.

**I. Translate the Cosmic Palimpsest:**
Using the principles of the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014), raw observational data is translated into the language of the coherence manifold.
*   **Input**: Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps, galaxy distribution surveys, gravitational lensing data.
*   **Process**: This data is used to infer the *observed* properties of the Cosmic Coherence Manifold. CMB temperature fluctuations map to variations in primordial Temporal Pressure, while galaxy clustering reveals the observed resonant patterns.
*   **Output**: Maps of the observed field, `𝓛_p(observed)`.

**II. Generate the Null Canvas:**
The theoretical baseline is computed based on a smooth, homogenous, and isotropic cosmology.
*   **Input**: Standard cosmological parameters (e.g., Ω_m, Ω_Λ).
*   **Process**: The Pirouette Lagrangian is solved for these parameters to generate a map of the predicted, maximally coherent field. This is the universe with no history.
*   **Output**: Maps of the baseline model, `𝓛_p(model)`.

**III. Calculate the Residuals & Map the Scars:**
The observed map is subtracted from the theoretical map to reveal where reality deviates from the idealized state.
*   **Process**: The Coherence Residual is calculated: `Δ𝓛_p = 𝓛_p(observed) - 𝓛_p(model)`.
*   **Output**: A **Coherence Residual Map**. This is not a map of errors, but a map of history. Regions where this value exceeds a statistical threshold are flagged and classified as cosmic scars.
