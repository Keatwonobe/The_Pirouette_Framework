The Auditor correlates every event in the original raw data with a corresponding dip in the Lagrangian trace. The magnitude and duration of the dip provide a precise, quantitative "impact score" for that event. This score is not an arbitrary proxy; it is a direct measure of the coherence lost.

Formally, the **Impact (I)** of an event (fᵢ) is the magnitude of the negative change in the system's total Action (ΔSₚ) that is correlated with that event. It is the integral of the dip in the Lagrangian caused by the event:

I(fᵢ) ≈ - ∫_dip Δ𝓛_p dt

An event has high impact if it sharply degrades the system's internal resonance or exposes it to a spike in environmental pressure, forcing it off its optimal path.
