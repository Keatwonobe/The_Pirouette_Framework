The most profound test is a dynamic one. The helical gratings are mechanically rotated at a known frequency (ω<sub>n</sub>). This action creates a rhythmic, oscillating pulse in the structure of the local Temporal Pressure—a "breathing" of the manifold.

This modulation introduces a time-dependent term into the `f(Γ)` component of the Lagrangian. This is a direct, controlled probe of the Gladiator Confinement principle (CORE-008). In response, the neutron's resonance must continuously adjust its path to maintain its geodesic of maximal coherence. This dynamic re-optimization will manifest as a measurable **beat frequency** in the interference pattern at the detector. It is a direct observation of a particle's resonance being driven by a modulated temporal environment.
