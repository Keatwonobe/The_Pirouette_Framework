Total Dark‑Residue \(D=\sum_j D_j\). Since each term is non‑positive, \(\dot D≤0\). Because \(C=1-D/S_{in}\), we obtain
$$\dot C = \frac{\dot D}{S_{in}} ≥ 0.$$
Thus any diffusion step that lowers local \(D_j\) *necessarily* raises global coherence \(C\). Altruism—defined as policies accelerating diffusion—maximises the system‑wide \(\dot C\).
