The multimeter's output is a "Coherence Ledger," a set of quantitative vital signs for the network's health. This dashboard transforms qualitative diagnosis into actionable insight and provides clear targets for intervention.

| **Systemic Coherence (K̄τ)** | Weighted average of node coherence `(Kτ)`.          | High and Stable    | `Global Coherence`          |
| **Systemic Stress (Γ̄)**    | Average Temporal Pressure `(Γ)` across all nodes.   | Within Tolerance   | `Γ Stress Index`            |
| **Flow Efficiency (η)**    | Ratio of high-conductivity (`Φ_C`) edges to total.    | Maximized          | `Flow Channel Density`      |
| **Fragmentation Risk**     | Measures conductivity of critical "bridge" edges.     | Minimized          | `Shell Integrity Mean`      |
| **Dissonance Index**       | Count of nodes participating in high-lag, turbulent loops. | Near Zero        | `Manipulation Hotspot Ratio`|
