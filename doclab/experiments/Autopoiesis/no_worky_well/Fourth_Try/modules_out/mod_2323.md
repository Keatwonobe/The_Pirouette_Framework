* **Dimension estimator** (d(E)): e.g., from chain/interval counts (Myrheim-type).
* **Curvature proxy** (\mathcal{K}(E,v)): function of small order intervals around (v).
* **Holonomy**: assign a phase (\phi(\gamma)\in U(1)) to each closed loop (\gamma) in the **order complex** (simplicial complex built from chains). A *spin structure* is a (\mathbb{Z}_2) lift with the rule that certain fundamental 2-spheres carry a sign.

  * **Spin-½ axiom**: there exists a class of loops with (\phi(\gamma)= -1) and (\phi(\gamma^2)= +1). (720° return.)

These are *invariants* native to order, not to coordinates.
