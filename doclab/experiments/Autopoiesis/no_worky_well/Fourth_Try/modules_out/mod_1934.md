summary: Provides an engineering pathway to create macroscopic, reflective shields
  by projecting the confinement principle of a single proton into a tangible 2D surface.
  This is achieved through 'Coherence Extrusion,' a process that locks a proton's
  temporal update cycle along one axis, forcing its Wound Channel to unroll into a
  'Resonant Wall' of near-perfect coherence.
