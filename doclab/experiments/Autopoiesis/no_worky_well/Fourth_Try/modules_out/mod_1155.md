The resilience of a system is its ability to maintain coherence when subjected to external temporal pressure (`Î“`). The Prime Resonance Principle explains why the Mode Number (`N`) is a primary determinant of this resilience through the concept of topological irreducibility.

-   **Composite Systems (`N=6`, `N=12`, etc.):** A system with a composite number of modes, such as 6 (2x3), is topologically reducible. Its coherence manifold possesses natural "cleavage planes" or harmonic fracture points. It can be understood as a coupled system of 2 modes interacting with 3 modes. This structure creates vulnerabilities. A specific frequency of external pressure might excite a sub-harmonic, creating internal dissonance that can easily tear the system apart. It is a structure built of bricks, with fault lines along the mortar.

-   **Prime Systems (`N=5`, `N=7`, etc.):** A system with a prime number of modes is topologically irreducible. It is a "monolithic" entity, a single, flawless crystal. It has no simpler sub-symmetries or harmonic fracture planes that can be independently excited. To perturb the system, one must perturb the *entire system* at once. This holistic entanglement provides a powerful, broad-spectrum resistance to a wide variety of temporal pressures, making the system inherently dissonance-resistant.
