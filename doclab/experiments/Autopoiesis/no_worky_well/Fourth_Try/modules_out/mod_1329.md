summary: "Modernizes 'Funnel Inversion' into a time-first model of phase transition,\
  \ defined as a Resonance Cascade. This cascade is a non-linear topological transformation\u2014\
  a Chiral Shift\u2014driven by overwhelming Temporal Pressure (\u0393) and internal\
  \ Coherence Stress (\u03C3_K). It establishes the Chiral Fork as the three fundamental\
  \ topological solutions (Achromatic, Left-Handed, Right-Handed) a system can adopt\
  \ to find a new state of maximal coherence, and provides a predictive calculus for\
  \ anticipating these events."
