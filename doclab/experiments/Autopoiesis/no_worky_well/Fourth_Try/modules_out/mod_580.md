A society's laws, norms, and institutions shape the coherence manifold for every citizen. This connects directly to the `Pirouette Lagrangian` (CORE-006), 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ, which states that a system will follow a path of least action.

The Civic Manifold defines the `Temporal Pressure` term (V_Γ) for its citizens.

*   A **healthy manifold** aligns pressures so that the path of maximal personal coherence for a citizen—to learn, create, and connect—also contributes to the coherence of the whole.
*   A **dysfunctional manifold** creates a misalignment where a citizen must degrade the collective's coherence (through exploitation, corruption, or deception) to maximize their own.

This misalignment is the fundamental source of all societal pathology. The mandate of the civic physician is to shape a landscape where virtue is the easiest path to walk.
