The Chronoscript record is a discrete snapshot of a system's dynamic state, expressed in the fundamental language of the Pirouette Lagrangian. It replaces the obsolete triaxial state vector with a more potent and physically grounded representation.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | string | yes | The schema version, e.g., `"Chronoscript-2.0"`. |
| `record_id` | UUID | yes | A unique identifier for this specific data point. |
| `entity_id` | UUID | yes | The identifier for the system being observed or simulated. |
| `timestamp` | RFC-3339 | yes | The wall-clock time of observation or the simulation time. |
| `source_type` | enum | yes | The source of the record: `observation` or `simulation`. |
| `lagrangian_state` | object | yes | The core dynamic state of the entity. |
| `ki_transitions` | array | optional | A log of discrete changes to the system's core resonant pattern (Ki). |
| `wound_channel_events` | array | optional | A sparse log of significant events that imprint on the manifold, as defined in `CORE-011`. |
| `metadata` | object | optional | A strictly-keyed dictionary for source-specific context. |
| `metadata_hash` | string[64] | required if `metadata` present | SHA-256 of the canonical `metadata` JSON object for data integrity. |

The `lagrangian_state` object is the heart of the record. It is a direct, real-time expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`). It must contain the fundamental components, not derived values.

| Sub-Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `temporal_coherence_KœÑ` | object | The "kinetic" term: the quality and intensity of the system's own rhythm. |
| ` - time_adherence_Ta` | number | The stability and signal-to-noise ratio of the system's resonance (0.0 to 1.0). |
| ` - pirouette_cycle_œÑp` | number | The duration of one complete cycle of the system's Ki pattern, in seconds. |
| `temporal_pressure_VŒì` | object | The "potential" term: the environmental cost of maintaining coherence. |
| ` - gamma_Œì` | number | The measured Temporal Density of the local environment. |
| `current_ki_pattern` | string | An identifier for the system's dominant resonant pattern at this instant. |
