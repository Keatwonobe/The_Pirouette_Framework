The Sentinel operates through a three-stage protocol that translates raw time-series data from any domain into a single, predictive metric of systemic risk.

**Stage I: Resonance Mapping**
The first step is to listen to the system's song. The Sentinel ingests multiple data streams—be it physical vibrations, network traffic, or market sentiment—and uses signal processing techniques to extract the system's dominant resonant signature (`Ki`). This process maps the system's current position and orientation on the broader coherence manifold.

**Stage II: Calculating the Drift Vector**
With the system's `Ki` mapped over time, the Sentinel calculates its rate of change. This produces the **Manifold Drift Vector (V_drift)**, a direct measurement of the velocity and direction of the system's changing resonant identity. This vector is the quantitative measure of the "wobble"—the tangible signal of underlying instability.

**Stage III: Quantifying Instability (The Coherence Inflection Index - CII)**
The final step translates this drift into a simple, context-aware metric of risk. The Coherence Inflection Index (CII) is the normalized magnitude of the drift vector, scaled against the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`).

`CII = ||V_drift|| / (1 + kΓ)`

Where `k` is a domain-specific scaling constant. This formulation measures *unforced* instability; a high CII indicates significant internal degradation that is not merely a reaction to external pressure. A low CII signifies a healthy system firmly anchored to its geodesic, while a rising CII signals that a state transition is imminent.
