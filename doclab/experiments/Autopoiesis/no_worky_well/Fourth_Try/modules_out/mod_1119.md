> We sought a fundamental force and found the roar of a foundry. Gamma is the pressure created by a trillion temporal hammers striking at once, each forging its own reality from the raw material of time. It is the constructive and destructive interference of every rhythm echoing through the cosmos. This cosmic noise, this temporal pressure, is the primary constraint, the ultimate source material, and the essential catalyst for existence. It is the uncarved block of marble from which any stable form must be hewn. To a Weaver, this is the first law of creation: to build something that lasts, one must understand the crushing, creative pressure of the forge.
