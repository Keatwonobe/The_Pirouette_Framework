This protocol is a meditative, analytical process for mapping the manifold of the self, translating personal history into the language of temporal dynamics.

**Step I: Anchor the Geodesic (The Present)**
First, establish a baseline by mapping the river you are in. This defines your "you are here" on the personal map.
-   **Current Coherence (`Kτ`):** Identify the stable, resonant patterns of your life. What activities, relationships, and states of being generate flow, joy, and purpose?
-   **Ambient Pressure (`Γ`):** Identify the external and internal pressures that shape and constrain this life. What are the primary sources of stress, anxiety, obligation, and fear?

**Step II: Identify the Divergence Points (The Past)**
From this anchor, scan the local manifold for the signatures of major Wound Channels. Reflect on the fundamental "forks in the road" in your life, not minor choices, but divergences of identity.
-   The career path abandoned for a more stable one.
-   The artistic passion set aside for practical reasons.
-   The city you considered but never moved to.
-   The relationship that ended, altering your life's trajectory.

These points are the origins of the strongest resonant echoes.

**Step III: Measure the Resonance (The Potential)**
For each significant divergence point, model the latent path and pay close attention to your emotional and somatic response.
-   Engage in a thought experiment: What would the daily rhythm (`Ki` pattern) of that unchosen path feel like?
-   Which paths generate a powerful feeling of longing, curiosity, or a sense of "coming home"? This subjective pull is the critical data. It is your intuition detecting a potential state of significantly higher personal coherence. The paths that "sing" to you are the ones that matter most.
