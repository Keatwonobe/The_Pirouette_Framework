The mechanics of this dissolution are governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006), which dictates that a system will follow the path that maximizes its coherence (`Kτ`) while minimizing its environmental cost (`V_Γ`).

𝓛_p = `Kτ` - `V_Γ`

In the Zero-Sum Pirouette, the system discovers a unique and catastrophic geodesic.
*   **Coherence Cancellation:** The particle and antiparticle possess `Ki` patterns of opposite sign. As their coherence manifolds overlap, their individual `Kτ` terms undergo perfect destructive interference, causing the total coherence of the combined system to collapse towards zero: `Kτ (sys) → 0`.
*   **Potential Release:** With the coherence term nullified, the Lagrangian is dominated by the potential term, `𝓛_p ≈ -V_Γ`, which represents the immense energetic cost required to sustain the two separate, structured forms against the **Temporal Forge** (CORE-003).

To maximize the integral of this negative Lagrangian, the system must reduce the duration of its existence to an absolute minimum. The path of least resistance—the most coherent action—is an instantaneous and total release of the stored potential `V_Γ`. The system follows its geodesic to its logical, and final, conclusion. This is not a violation of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, but its most extreme expression: it is more coherent for these two entities to not exist at all than to exist in conflict.
