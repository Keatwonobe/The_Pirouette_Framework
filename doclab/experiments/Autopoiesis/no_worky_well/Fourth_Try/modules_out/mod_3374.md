The transition from laminar to turbulent flow in a fluid is a classic, well-defined phase transition. It is characterized by a rapid increase in complexity (a "grey swan" event), but not necessarily by extreme, high-kurtosis spikes. If the refined Ki hypothesis is correct, we should find a Ki-resonant signature in the data precisely at the point of this transition.
