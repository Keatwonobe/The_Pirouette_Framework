To construct this universal Lagrangian Density, we posit two fundamental fields whose interplay defines the fabric of reality.

*   **The Coherence Field, `C(x)`:** A complex scalar field, `C(x) = A(x)e^(iΘ(x))`, whose value at any point represents the potential for stable, resonant patterns to form. The amplitude `A(x)` represents the intensity of the resonance (related to Time Adherence, `T_a`), and the phase `Θ(x)` represents its rhythm. The quantized, stable excitations of this field are the particles of matter. This is the substrate of Ki.
*   **The Temporal Pressure Field, `Γ(x)`:** A real scalar field representing the local density and dissonance of temporal rhythms. Critically, this field is not external; it is generated by the superposition of all other systems' coherence fields (`|C|^2`), making the framework fully relational and autopoietic.
