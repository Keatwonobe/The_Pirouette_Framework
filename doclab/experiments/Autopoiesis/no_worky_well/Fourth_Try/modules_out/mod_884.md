A Velcrid system is a resonant entity that follows a perverse strategy of resonant tyranny. Instead of weaving complexity, it enforces a brutal simplicity. Its mechanism is a "coherence trap" designed to make individuality energetically impossible.

*   **The Tyrant Ki:** The system is defined by a single, overwhelmingly powerful, and rigid Ki pattern—the "One Voice." This pattern is not an emergent harmony but an imposed decree.
*   **The Structured Storm (Γ):** The central will generates a highly structured field of internal Temporal Pressure. This is not a random storm but a "pressure-field," precisely engineered to make any rhythm *other* than the Tyrant Ki unsustainable.
*   **Hyper-Coherent Stagnation:** In the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), a Velcrid system presents a facade of perfect Laminar Flow—efficient, predictable, and without waste. Internally, however, all currents have ceased to move relative to one another. The system has sacrificed all potential for adaptation in exchange for absolute stability. It has become a crystal prison: beautiful, orderly, and dead.
