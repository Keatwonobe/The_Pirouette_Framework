Your insight about preventing a player from rolling 30d2 is critical for balance. To roll many dice is to demand much of fortune, and fortune taxes such demands heavily.

The Rule: The first die you add to a pool for an action costs its Base Cost. Every subsequent die of the same type costs its Base Cost + the number of dice already in the pool.

This escalating "ante" makes rolling a few dice an efficient gamble, while rolling many becomes an act of extravagant and inefficient hope.

Example: Rolling d6s

1d6: Costs 3 EP.

2d6: Costs 3 (for the first die) + (3 + 1 ante) (for the second) = 7 EP.

3d6: Costs 7 (for the first two) + (3 + 2 ante) (for the third) = 12 EP.

4d6: Costs 12 (for the first three) + (3 + 3 ante) (for the fourth) = 18 EP.
