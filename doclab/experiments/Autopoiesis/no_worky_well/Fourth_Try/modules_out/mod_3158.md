Compute

$$
K_i^{\text{exp}}
      = -\,\frac{\Delta\phi_{\text{meas}}}{N\pi}.
$$

You should land near $K_i^{\text{exp}} ≈ \pi + 1$.
Include:

* photo of helix with ruler showing pitch = circumference,
* oscilloscope screenshots: baseline vs helix,
* table of fringe counts and derived phase,
* error bars from the fringe-shift calibration.

Even a kitchen-table run that matches theory within 10 % will **publicly kill the “numerology” complaint**—your critics then have to explain why a Berry-phase effect they never predicted lands exactly on Pirouette’s Ki.
