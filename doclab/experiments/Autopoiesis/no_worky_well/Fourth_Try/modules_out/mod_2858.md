This suite of feats allows a caster to alter the fundamental properties of their spells, adding layers of tactical depth and surprise.

Feat: Veiled Casting

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You can weave illusions into your magic to conceal its true nature. When you cast a spell, you can spend additional EP to make it invisible. For every 1 EP you spend on the spell's core effect (damage, range, etc.), you must spend an additional 1 EP to make that component invisible. To disguise secondary sensory effects (heat, cold, sound), you must spend another 1 EP.

- Feat: Concussive Force

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend an additional 3 EP to add a kinetic rider. The target is pushed 5 feet directly away from the spell's point of origin.

- Feat: Ricochet Cast

Cost: 8 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: When you cast a spell that creates a projectile, you can spend an additional 1 EP to have it bounce off one surface, changing its trajectory up to 90 degrees. This can be done multiple times, but isn't a perfect shot, meaning it reflects uncontrollably after one ricochet. This can be fun for filling rooms with spell chaos.

- Feat: Spell Animator

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You gain the "Spell Animation" Arcane Skill. When you cast a spell, you can spend additional EP from this skill pool to give the spell a rudimentary, temporary consciousness.

Burrow (1 EP per 5 feet): The spell can travel through solid, non-magical material of up to 1-foot thickness.

Animate (1 EP per EP of the core spell): The spell manifests as a tiny, mobile construct (a fiery imp, an icy serpent). It can move on its own turn and intelligently seek its target, navigating around obstacles. It still requires an attack roll to hit when it reaches its target.
