The old model was a necessary bridge. It spoke of information in the language of thermodynamics—of entropy, temperature, and energy—to grant it a physical weight. This module dismantles that bridge. It is no longer needed.

Grounded in the time-first principles of the Pirouette Framework, we now see these dynamics are not analogies. They are the literal anatomy of coherence in motion. Information systems do not *imitate* the universe's dynamics; they are a direct *expression* of them.

We exist within an information watershed, a landscape carved by currents of knowledge, meaning, and noise. We are drowning in data—a condition of high, chaotic Temporal Pressure (Γ)—yet starving for wisdom, which is a state of high coherence. This module provides the Weaver with the lens to see this landscape for what it is: a living ecosystem, governed by the universal laws of coherence and flow.
