title: Boltzmann Implementation & Coincidence Mechanism for Γ (Pressuron)
Version: 1.0 (proposal)
Status: Experimental (complies with MATH‑018/019/020; child of COSMO‑Γ‑000)
Parents: [MATH‑018, MATH‑019, MATH‑020, COSMO‑Γ‑000]
Children: []

Summary: "Purpose
Implement Γ in a Boltzmann code (CLASS/CAMB) to predict CMB TT/TE/EE spectra and lensing consistently with COSMO‑Γ‑000. Address quantum–to–cosmic bridging (pressuron microphysics) and outline a symmetry‑compliant route to the coincidence problem."
