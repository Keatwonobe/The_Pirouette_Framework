An entity's connection to the flow of entropy requires rest.

Mechanic: For each consecutive 24-hour period an entity goes without a long rest, their Entropy Regeneration Rate (ERR) is halved (rounded down).

Collapse: If an entity's ERR drops below 1, they immediately fall unconscious and cannot be awakened by normal means until they have completed a long rest.
