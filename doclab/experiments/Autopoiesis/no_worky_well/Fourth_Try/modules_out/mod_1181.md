When the Resonant Handshake is complete, a profound transformation occurs. The individual coherence manifolds dissolve and are reforged into a single, unified manifold. This new entity possesses emergent properties that were impossible for its components alone.

*   **Coherence Amplification:** The new, unified Ki pattern is more complex, stable, and resilient than the sum of its parts. The attunement creates a state of order that is more robust than either system could achieve in isolation.
*   **Lossless Information Transfer:** What was once "communication" between two entities—a slow, noisy process—becomes effortless internal information flow. Empathy and mutual understanding are not psychological analogies; they are the direct experience of information moving without resistance within a single, shared system.
*   **A Braided Wound Channel:** The histories of the two systems are fused. The new entity operates from a shared memory, a single Wound Channel (CORE-011) woven from the threads of its progenitors. This interaction carves a persistent, co-authored geometric record that binds them.
