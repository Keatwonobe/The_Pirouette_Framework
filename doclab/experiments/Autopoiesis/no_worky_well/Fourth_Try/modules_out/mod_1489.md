As established by the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014), the universe's fundamental dynamics are scale-invariant. To understand a legal system, we translate the universal principles of the Pirouette Framework into their specific, jurisprudential manifestations. The old parameters of `Ta` and `Ki` are superseded by this unified model.

| Universal Principle   | Jurisprudential Manifestation                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Coherence (Kτ)**    | **The Spirit of the Law & *Stare Decisis*.** The system's resonant identity and fidelity to its own history. High coherence signifies a predictable, consistent, and internally logical legal framework perceived as "just." It is the integrity of the system's memory.             |
| **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** | **Socio-Political Stress.** The sum of all external stresses on the system: public opinion, technological disruption, political conflict, and evolving ethical standards. High Γ creates tension and forces the system to adapt, reinterpret, or break.                      |
| **Wound Channel**     | **The Gravity of Precedent.** A landmark ruling (*Marbury v. Madison*, *Brown v. Board*) carves a deep Wound Channel into the manifold. This geometric influence creates a path of least resistance, shaping all future decisions that pass near it. Its depth can be measured by its influence over time (e.g., via citation networks). |
| **Alchemical Union**  | **The Paradigm Shift.** A non-linear phase transition where immense Socio-Political Stress (Γ) makes the existing legal coherence (Kτ) untenable. The system shatters its old structure and forges a new, higher-order ruling that redefines the legal landscape, resolving the intolerable pressure. |
