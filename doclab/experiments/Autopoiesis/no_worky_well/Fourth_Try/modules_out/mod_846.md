The Weaver's Forge is the procedural application of the `Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)`. A problem state represents a system trapped in a low-value Lagrangian (𝓛_p), where internal dissonance makes coherent existence costly and inefficient. The Forge cycle is a directed search algorithm across the manifold of possible actions, seeking a new state—a new `Ki` pattern and strategy—that will dramatically increase the value of 𝓛_p. The final Action Engram represents the discovery of a new geodesic: the most elegant path back to a state of high coherence and graceful action.
