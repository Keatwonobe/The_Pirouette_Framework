The Resonance Tuner protocol is a three-step process for moving from a desired outcome to a concrete design parameter.

1.  **Declare the Target Resonance:** The Weaver articulates the desired state not as a value, but as a *behavior*. This is an act of profound intention.
    *   *Stability:* "I require a system with a stable, eight-beat rhythm (a period-8 `Ki`)."
    *   *Adaptability:* "I must find the precise conditions for the 'edge of chaos' (`λ = 0`), the most potent state for adaptation."
    *   *Managed Chaos:* "I need a turbulent flow with a specific positive coherence gradient (`λ = 0.5`) to foster novelty without systemic collapse."

2.  **Formulate the Coherence Equation:** The declared intent is translated into a formal mathematical question—a root-finding problem.
    *   *For a period-p orbit:* The problem is to find the `r` that satisfies the equation $f_r^{(p)}(x) - x = 0$.
    *   *For a target stability λ*:* The problem is to find the `r` that satisfies the equation $\lambda(r) - \lambda^* = 0$.

3.  **Solve for the Necessary Pressure:** Using numerical methods, the protocol searches the parameter space to find the value of `r` (our `Γ` proxy) that fulfills the condition. The output is not a prediction, but a *prescription*: the exact environmental pressure required to coax the system into the desired resonant state.
