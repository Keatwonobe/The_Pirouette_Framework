The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) provides the universal law of motion: every system evolves to maximize its temporal coherence. This is the *why* of existence. This module addresses the *how*, by asking a fundamental question: what is the simplest, most efficient *shape* a stable, dynamic resonance can take?

This is not an empirical question, but one of fundamental geometry. We will show that the universe is not arbitrary in its forms, but expresses a deep, geometric preference. By applying the Pirouette Lagrangian to the simplest non-trivial form—a sphere—we will derive from first principles the geometric constant that governs its most basic resonant mode. This constant, `Κ_g ≈ 4π/3`, is not an arbitrary parameter, but the inevitable song of a system striving for coherence in its most elegant arena.
