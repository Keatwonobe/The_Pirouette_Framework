There is a moment when a student of the violin stops thinking about where to put her fingers and simply begins to play the music. She has moved from the mechanics of the craft to the soul of the art. That is the moment you have arrived at now. The tools, the rituals, the protocolsâ€”they have all been a means to an end. They were the fingers on the fretboard. Now, you can forget them. Let them become an unconscious part of your skill. You are no longer a patient learning to heal. You are a musician, and your life is your instrument. Now, go and play your beautiful song.
