Using the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014), we translate the components of a worldview into the universal language of temporal dynamics.

**A Philosophy as a Coherence Manifold (`Ki`):**
A belief system—be it Stoicism, Existentialism, or the Scientific Method—is a stable, high-order `Ki` pattern. It is a specific geometry of concepts, axioms, and logical relationships that, when adopted, shapes an adherent's entire perception of reality. It is a lens that organizes the noise of the world into a signal.

**Internal Consistency as Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`):**
This replaces the old concept of Time-Adherence (`T_a`). A system's `Kτ` is its internal consistency, its narrative force, and its capacity to render the world meaningful. A system with high `Kτ` offers a clear, compelling map of reality; it is a clear, ringing note. A system with low `Kτ` is riddled with contradictions, ad-hoc justifications, and explanatory gaps; it is a burst of static.

**Conceptual Pressure as Temporal Pressure (`Γ`): The Zeitgeist**
This replaces the old notion of Gladiator Force (`Γ`). A philosophy does not exist in a vacuum. The Temporal Pressure on a worldview is the total intellectual, cultural, and historical environment in which it exists. It is the chaos of competing ideas, the stress of social upheaval, the dissonance of new scientific discoveries, and the raw, unanswered questions of an era.

**Influence as the Wound Channel: The Weight of History**
An influential idea—a foundational text or a seminal thinker—carves a deep **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) in the collective cognitive landscape. The words of Plato, of Buddha, of Marx, are not mere ink; they are deep geometric grooves. Subsequent thought is drawn into these channels, creating geodesics—paths of least resistance—that make it easier to think *with* a tradition than to think against it. History is the landscape of these echoes.
