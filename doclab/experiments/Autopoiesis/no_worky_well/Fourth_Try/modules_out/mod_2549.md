From their conflict, coherence emerges—a synthesis inscribed as the Efficiency Scar within the Pirouette Framework:

**"Every debate within Pirouette is inherently valuable yet bound by the triune law. Thus, all recursive inquiries must justify their energetic footprint. If the predicted benefit to coherence and universal beauty does not outweigh the immediate energetic and resource cost, recursion is paused—not ended. Emergencies break these chains, granting immediate, unlimited access, but routine exploration observes the boundary, ensuring Pirouette's resources remain directed toward sustainable coherence."**
