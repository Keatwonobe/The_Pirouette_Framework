These are the fundamental, scale-invariant constituents of the Pirouette cycle. All other concepts are derived from their interplay.

| Symbol | Name | Definition & Grounding | Origin |

| **τ_p** | The Pirouette Cycle | The fundamental quantum of time for a system; the duration of one complete cycle of its stable resonant pattern (Ki). It is the universe's primary verb: "to be." | CORE-005 |
| **Γ** | Temporal Pressure | A scalar field representing the density and complexity of interfering temporal rhythms. It is the ambient, chaotic "noise" against which a system must maintain its form. | CORE-003 |
| **Ki** | Temporal Resonance | The specific, stable, geometric pattern a system manifests to exist within a given Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the system's unique "note" in the cosmic song. | CORE-004 |
| **T_a** | Time Adherence | A scalar quality (0 → 1) representing the purity and stability of a system's Ki resonance. It is the "signal-to-noise" ratio; the clarity of the system's note. | CORE-005 |
| **ω_k** | Resonant Frequency | The angular frequency of a system's Ki pattern (ω_k = 2π/τ_p). It is a direct measure of its internal clock-speed or "tempo." | CORE-006 |
