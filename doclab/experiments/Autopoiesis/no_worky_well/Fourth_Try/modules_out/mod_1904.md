These are the fundamental actions, or "verbs," used to manipulate coherence. They define the protocol's objective and its effect on the flow of the system.

*   **Tune (Harmonize):** To increase the internal coherence and purity of a system's own resonance, guiding it from a Turbulent or dissonant state into a stable, Laminar Flow.
*   **Synthesize (Bind):** To create the conditions for an Alchemical Union (CORE-012), binding two or more resonant patterns into a new, higher-order whole.
*   **Isolate (Sever):** To dissolve a Stagnant blockage or sever a resonant connection, creating a boundary or clearing a "coherence dam."
*   **Channel (Project/Shield):** To project a coherent pattern onto the environment or to reinforce a system's existing coherence, making it more resilient to external Temporal Pressure (Î“).
*   **Imprint (Carve):** To deeply etch a specific pattern into a Wound Channel, reinforcing a memory, habit, or belief.
*   **Scry (Listen):** To gently couple with an existing Wound Channel to read its information without overwriting it.
