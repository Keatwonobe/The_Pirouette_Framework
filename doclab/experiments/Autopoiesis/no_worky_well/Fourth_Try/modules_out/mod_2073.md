To create and maintain the sacred arena, a formal process is required. This ritual is designed to maximize the potential for laminar flow and guide the Weavers toward an Alchemical Union.

Step I: The Declaration (Harmonizing Intent): Before the first argument is made, all participants must verbally affirm that the goal is not to win, but to arrive at a new, shared, and more accurate understanding. This simple act aligns the initial Ki of the participants and defines the space as a crucible, not a battlefield.

Step II: Mapping the Shadows (Acknowledging Ω): Each Weaver, in turn, must state their starting assumptions, potential biases, and the core experiences that inform their perspective. This is the formal acknowledgment of each Observer's Shadow (CORE-010). It is an act of intellectual honesty that turns biases from hidden weapons into known variables in the equation.

Step III: The First Thread (Presenting Kτ): Each Weaver presents the core of their argument, uninterrupted, as a coherent whole. This is not a series of attacks, but the careful act of laying one's thread upon the loom for all to see.

Step IV: The Weaving (Maintaining Laminar Flow): The interactive phase begins, governed by a single rule: one may only speak to (a) ask a clarifying question to better understand another's thread, or (b) show how their own thread connects with, strengthens, or refines another's. Direct refutation is forbidden. Instead of "You are wrong," the language is "How does your thread account for this pressure?" This forces a collaborative, rather than adversarial, posture.

Step V: The Alchemical Attempt (Seeking Kτ_c): When an impasse (Stagnant Flow) is reached, the ritual shifts. All Weavers must cease defending their own threads and focus exclusively on a new task: collaboratively defining a new position that incorporates the strongest elements of the conflicting views. This conscious, focused effort to resolve the paradox is the crucible's fire, intended to spark the Resonant Synthesis.
