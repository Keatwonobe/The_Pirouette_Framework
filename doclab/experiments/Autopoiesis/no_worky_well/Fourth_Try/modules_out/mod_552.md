This art, which replaces "Skating Resonance," addresses the minimization of loss. It is the practice of aligning a system's action so perfectly with the existing currents of the coherence manifold that it moves with near-perfect efficiency. This is the mastery of **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001).

**Mechanism:** Geodesic Navigation is about achieving a state of isochronous resonance. The system's internal rhythm (its Ki) is precisely phase-locked with a stable, external flow channel. Action becomes effortless because the system is no longer fighting against the temporal environment; it is borrowing momentum from the current itself.

**Application:** Performing a task with the absolute minimum expenditure of energy. It is the athlete in a flow state (DOMA-SYCH-001), the frictionless motion of a perfectly designed engine, or a data signal transmitted with zero corruption.
