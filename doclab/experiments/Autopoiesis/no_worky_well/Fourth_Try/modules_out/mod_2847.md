These feats alter the fundamental minigames of combat, allowing for advanced offensive and defensive maneuvers.

- Feat: Reactive Evasion

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You have the "final word" in your own defense. When an enemy makes an attack roll against you, after they roll but before the outcome is determined, you can use your reaction to spend EP from your Dexterity attribute pool. For every 3 EP you spend, you may subtract 1 from the enemy's attack roll.

- Feat: Precision Strike

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: Your accuracy can be converted into raw power. When you make an attack roll and the result is higher than the Target Number (TN), you can choose to add the difference to the attack's damage as bonus EP. This bonus cannot exceed +5 EP.
