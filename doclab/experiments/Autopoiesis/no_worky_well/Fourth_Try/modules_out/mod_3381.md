This protocol is not a physical experiment to re-measure $g-2$, but a **theoretical challenge** to calculate it from Pirouette's axioms.

1.  **Model the Electron `Entity`:** The electron is modeled as a stable, point-like "knot" in the Pirouette fields. Its state is defined by its calibrated Gladiator Force ($\\Gamma\_{electron} = 1/\\alpha$), a high and stable Time-Adherence ($T\_a \\approx 1$), and a fundamental `Ki-mode` corresponding to its spin.

2.  **Define the `Wound Channel`:** The electron's charge and spin create a persistent, helical `Wound Channel` in the surrounding field, as described in `PPS-008`. The structure of this channel is a direct function of the electron's `Ki-mode` and its interaction with the vacuum.

3.  **Model the Self-Interaction:** The "anomaly" in the magnetic moment is the energy shift caused by the electron `Entity` interacting with its own `Wound Channel`. This is a self-energy correction. The interaction can be represented by a new term in the local Lagrangian:
    $$\mathcal{L}_{g-2} = \lambda \cdot \Psi_{electron} \cdot \Phi_{WoundChannel}$$
    Here, $\\Psi\_{electron}$ is the electron's state function, $\\Phi\_{WoundChannel}$ is the field of its wound channel, and $\\lambda$ is a coupling constant directly proportional to $\\Gamma\_{electron}$.

4.  **Calculate the Correction:** The final step is to calculate the change in the electron's energy in a magnetic field due to this interaction term. This calculation, performed using the appropriate field theory techniques within the Pirouette Framework, should yield a value for the anomalous magnetic moment, $a\_e = (g-2)/2$.
