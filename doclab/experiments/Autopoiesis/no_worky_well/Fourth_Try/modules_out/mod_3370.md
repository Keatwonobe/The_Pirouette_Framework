* **Successful Validation:** A persistent, statistically significant difference in the Ki-resonant signatures between the two clocks, with the orbiting clock showing more phase instability (lower Tₐ), would be powerful evidence for the relativistic nature of Time-Adherence.
* **Falsification:** If, after correcting for all known effects, the coherence signatures of the two clocks are statistically indistinguishable, it would challenge the proposed relativistic formulation of Tₐ, suggesting that it is either not affected by these factors or the effect is too small to be detected.
