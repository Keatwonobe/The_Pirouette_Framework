To provide a unified geometric formalism for interpreting coherence transitions as laminar–turbulent flow through the Pirouette manifold architecture. The Caduceus Lens visualizes and computes how coherence streams bifurcate, entangle, and re-stabilize across scales—from quark resonances to neural triads to social dissonance halos.
