This module specifies the experimental protocol for a targeted search for the **Maw "Thumper" gravitational wave (GW) signature** predicted in `PPS-071`. The core challenge is distinguishing this novel, rhythmic signal from the highly complex instrumental and environmental noise inherent in GW detectors. The protocol is designed around a **"Rhythm Filter,"** a two-stage analysis pipeline that first uses matched filtering to identify individual burst candidates and then uses autocorrelation to find persistent, rhythmic trains of these bursts. This method is supplemented by strict multi-detector coincidence and environmental veto protocols to produce a high-confidence result, providing the primary falsifiable test of the Pirouette Framework's astrophysical predictions.
