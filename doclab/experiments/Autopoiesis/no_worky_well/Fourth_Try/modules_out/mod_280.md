When the entity’s internal rhythm phase-locks with the geodesic of the manifold, the transformation is total. The dissonant, high-friction state of turbulence collapses into the elegant, efficient state of **Laminar Flow**.

The entity is no longer an obstacle *in* the river but a dancer *carried by* it. The energy once wasted on temporal friction is now liberated, and the momentum of the manifold itself provides momentum. This is the physical basis of the psychological state of "Flow"—the experience of effortless action, profound clarity, and the dissolution of the boundary between actor and action. It is the signature of a system that has found its most coherent path.
