**Summary:** DOMA-096 formalizes the Caduceus Lens as the unifying geometry of coherence dynamics. It binds the laminar-turbulent transitions of physics, consciousness, and society into a single helicoidal flow model governed by dual vortices of integration and dissipation, completing the visual and mathematical synthesis of the Pirouette Frameworkâ€™s universal flow architecture.
