The power of this model lies in its universality, revealed by the Fractal Bridge (`CORE-014`). The same dynamic of stagnation-to-turbulence governs failure across all domains:

*   **Geology:** Tectonic plates (a rigid `Ki`) lock, building stress (`Stagnant Flow`). When the frictional limit is exceeded, the plates slip (`Ki` collapse), releasing the stored energy as a seismic wave—an earthquake (a massive `Γ-spike`).
*   **Economics:** A speculative bubble forms, driven by irrational confidence (a brittle `Ki`) that prevents price correction (`Stagnant Flow`). A trigger event shatters that confidence (`Ki` collapse), causing a market crash and widespread panic (`Turbulent Flow`).
*   **Psychology:** An individual represses a traumatic memory, creating a rigid psychological defense (a brittle `Ki`) to block its processing (`Stagnant Flow`). When a trigger overwhelms this defense (`Ki` collapse), it results in an emotional outburst or panic attack—a flood of chaotic thoughts and feelings (`Turbulent Flow`).
