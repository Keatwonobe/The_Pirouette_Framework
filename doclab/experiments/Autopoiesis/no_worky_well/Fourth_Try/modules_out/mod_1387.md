To map a system's Coherence Landscape, the Weaver follows a rigorous, four-step protocol.

**Step I: Define the State Space.**
Identify the key parameters or variables (`S`) that define the system's configuration. This creates a multi-dimensional space where every point represents one possible state of being for the system.

**Step II: Translate to Pirouette Fields.**
This is the critical act of application, guided by the **Fractal Bridge (CORE-014)**. For each point `S` in the state space, the Weaver must determine the two components of the Pirouette Lagrangian:
*   **Temporal Coherence (`K_τ(S)`):** The "kinetic" term. This is a measure of the system's internal harmony, efficiency, and resonant purity in configuration `S`. It is the *reward* for being in that state.
*   **Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ(S)`):** The "potential" term. This is a measure of the environmental and self-induced stress, chaos, and dissonance the system must overcome to maintain configuration `S`. It is the *cost* of being in that state.

**Step III: Construct the Coherence Landscape.**
With the fields defined, the landscape is generated by calculating the value of the Pirouette Lagrangian at every point in the space: `𝓛_p(S) = K_τ(S) - V_Γ(S)`. This scalar field *is* the Coherence Landscape.

**Step IV: Navigate the Landscape.**
The final step is to analyze the landscape's geometry to understand the system's dynamics:
*   **Identify Attractors (Peaks):** Locate the local maxima of `𝓛_p(S)`. These peaks are the system's stable or metastable states—its points of highest efficiency and most elegant resonance.
*   **Map Paths of Evolution (Geodesics):** Calculate the gradient field `∇𝓛_p(S)`. The vectors of this field point "uphill," showing the path of steepest ascent. This is the geodesic of maximal coherence, the most probable evolutionary path for the system from any given point.
*   **Identify Transition States (Saddles):** Locate points where `∇𝓛_p(S) = 0` but curvature exists in multiple directions. These are the mountain passes between attractors, representing the energetic barriers to transition.
