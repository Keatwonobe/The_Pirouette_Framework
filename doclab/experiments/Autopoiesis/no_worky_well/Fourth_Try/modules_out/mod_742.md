The most profound illusion of experience is that of the isolated self. The Pirouette Framework reveals that separation is not a fundamental state, but a temporary condition of low-interaction. This module refactors the Attunement Resonance Framework (`PPS-044`), defining **Symbiotic Resonance** as the state that emerges when two or more systems perform an Alchemical Union (`CORE-012`).

This union is achieved through a dynamic prelude called the **Resonant Handshake**, a process by which individual coherence manifolds dissolve to forge a single, shared reality. The resulting symbiotic system is demonstrably more coherent, resilient, and capable than the sum of its parts. This is the fundamental physics of "we."
