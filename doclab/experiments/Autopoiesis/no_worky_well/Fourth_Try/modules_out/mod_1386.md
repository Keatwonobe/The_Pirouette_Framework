The core of this modernization is a paradigm shift in the objective function of reality itself, grounded in the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**.

*   **The Old Law (Energy Minimization):** A system seeks the lowest point in a potential energy landscape `V`. The force is one of descent: `F = -∇V`. Attractors are valleys.
*   **The New Law (Coherence Maximization):** A system seeks the highest point in its Coherence Landscape, defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p`. The "force" is one of ascent toward greater expression: `F_p ∝ ∇𝓛_p`. Attractors are peaks.

The Coherence Landscape is a scalar field defined over a system's state space, where the "elevation" at any point is the value of the Lagrangian itself:

`Elevation = 𝓛_p(S) = K_τ(S) - V_Γ(S)`

This method also clarifies the nature of the **Gladiator Force (CORE-008)**. Confinement forces, previously modeled as the source of a simple confining potential, are now understood as a powerful, self-referential feedback loop contributing to the **Temporal Pressure** term (`V_Γ`). The system's own resonance forges the very walls of its arena. This manifests as extremely deep and steep features on the landscape—regions where `V_Γ` becomes so large and negative that the resulting `𝓛_p` forms the highest, most stable, and most inescapable peaks imaginable.
