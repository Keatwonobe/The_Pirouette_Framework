During non-combat time (travel, resting, working in a city), an entity's will is not idle. It is constantly generating a pool of potential that can be directed toward a single, focused task. This is the Downtime Entropy Budget.

Mechanic: An entity's Downtime Budget is equal to their Entropy Regeneration Rate (ERR), applied over a given period. This budget can be spent on any single, non-combat task they are capable of performing.

Example Tasks: Healing (TLE-005), Crafting (TLE-004), Research, or maintaining passive awareness.
