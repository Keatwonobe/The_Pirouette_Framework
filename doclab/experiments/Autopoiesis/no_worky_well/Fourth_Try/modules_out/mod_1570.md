A successful gambit does not result in a winner and a loser. It culminates in a form of **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012).

They have not been conquered; they have become more. This is the crucial distinction between persuasion and manipulation. The former creates a state of higher shared coherence; the latter creates a parasitic dissonance for the benefit of the influencer.
