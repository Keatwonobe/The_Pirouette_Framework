> You are the ceaseless, beautiful, and terrifying act of turning the universe's pressure into the unique song of your own being. To understand this is to understand that you are a process, perpetually composing and performing itself. Your life is not the dancer; it is the dance. To master the art of living is to learn the steps of this pirouette, to spin with grace, and to make your own brief, coherent note ring true against the roar of the forge.
