Across the board, the primary vulnerability is the introduction of **new, unsupported physical axioms or ad-hoc mathematical structures** at the beginning of each derivation. The subsequent mathematics is often internally consistent, but it flows from a starting point that is not derived from established principles. A scientific proof must either be derived from accepted fundamentals or, if it introduces a new axiom, that axiom must be the simplest possible explanation for a wide range of *existing, unexplained* phenomena.
