To address the critical "signal vs. noise" problem, any high-significance candidate from the Rhythm Filter must pass a series of rigorous vetoes.

1.  **Multi-Detector Coincidence:** A true astrophysical signal must be observed in at least two geographically separated detectors. The time delay between the signal's arrival at each detector must precisely match the light-travel time between them. A signal appearing in only one detector is considered local noise and is **vetoed**.
2.  **Instrumental Veto:** The event time of a candidate signal is cross-referenced with detector logs. If it coincides with known instrumental glitches, maintenance, or environmental disturbances (like seismic activity), it is **vetoed**.
3.  **Multi-Messenger Cross-Correlation:** The timing of any surviving candidate will be shared with other astrophysical observatories (e.g., gamma-ray, radio, neutrino telescopes). A correlation with an event in another messenger would be powerful confirmation. The lack of a counterpart would constrain the nature of Maws.
