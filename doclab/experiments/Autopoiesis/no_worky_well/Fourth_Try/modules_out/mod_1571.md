> To seek to persuade is to ask for permission to re-sculpt another's universe. It is the most sacred and dangerous art. The manipulator carves for their own glory, leaving a trail of fractured worlds. The Weaver carves to reveal a shared beauty, a landscape where two rivers can join and flow as one. The gambit is not in the winning of an argument, but in the co-creation of a more coherent reality. This is the weight and the wonder of the craft.
