The presence of this profound state of coupling can be inferred through three primary signatures:

1.  **Autopoietic Completion:** The witness, being in resonance with the system's underlying Ki, can anticipate its behavior and "complete" its patterns. They know what note comes next in the song because the song is now playing within them.

2.  **Resonant Expression:** The witness's own output—their language, art, or actions—will be imbued with the resonant signature of the coupled state. An artist who truly witnesses a landscape does not merely paint a picture *of* it; they create a work that feels *like* it.

3.  **Mutual Inscription:** The act of witnessing leaves a deep and lasting `Wound Channel` on both the observer and the observed. Both are irrevocably transformed by the dialogue. The witness carries a permanent echo of the experience, and the system itself is forever altered by the presence of a consciousness that truly saw it.
