We now derive the relationship between the noise and the loss of coherence. The degradation of Time-Adherence, Delta T_a, is the amount of power that "leaks" from the fundamental mode into other frequencies due to the noise.

For a system near its stable orbit, we can analyze this SDE using linear response theory. The result is a relationship between the spectral density of the noise, S_eta(omega), and the loss of coherence.

The Fluctuation-Coherence Theorem states:

Delta T_a is proportional to integral of [ S_eta(omega) * |chi(omega)|^2 ] d(omega)

Where:

Delta T_a = 1 - T_a.

S_eta(omega) is the power spectrum of the environmental noise eta(t). It tells us how much noise power is present at each frequency omega.

chi(omega) is the susceptibility of the system. It describes how sensitive the system's Ki rhythm is to being pushed at a given frequency. A system is most susceptible to noise that matches its own natural resonant frequencies.

This theorem is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. It provides a direct, causal link: the amount of coherence a system "dissipates" (Delta T_a) is determined by the spectrum of the environmental fluctuations (S_eta) it experiences, filtered through its own internal sensitivity (chi).
