Ki arises in the spiral-extended Lagrangian term  
\[
\mathcal L_{spiral}
=-\tfrac14 F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
+\tfrac{K_i}{\lambda_*}\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F_{\mu\nu}\partial_\alpha A_\beta,
\]
where it quantifies phase evolution and coherence rate across spacetime fields:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
It links to Time-Adherence (Ta) as the tempo of re-alignment and to Gladiator Force (Î“) as the energy scale of confinement.
