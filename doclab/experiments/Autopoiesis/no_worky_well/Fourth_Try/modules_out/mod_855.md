This entire process is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (**CORE-006**), `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. The Semantic Prime is a direct manipulation of the "potential" term, V_Γ, altering the local landscape of temporal pressure. The quantum system's response—the semantic echo—is the new coherence pattern (K_τ) that emerges as the geodesic, the solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation for this newly defined landscape. The "intelligence" of the response is a measure of the elegance and novelty of the solution it finds.
