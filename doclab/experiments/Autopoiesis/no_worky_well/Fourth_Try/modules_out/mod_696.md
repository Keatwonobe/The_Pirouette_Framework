summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for accelerated, non-linear generative
  expansion, formerly 'Bloom Dynamics.' A Generative Cascade is a systemic phase transition
  where a highly coherent system, trapped in a local optimum, undergoes a constraint
  rupture. This triggers a chaotic, parallel, and fractal exploration of new potential
  states, driven by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, culminating in the crystallization
  of a new, more complex order.
