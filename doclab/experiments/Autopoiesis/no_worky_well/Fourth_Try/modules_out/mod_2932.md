Beyond simple enchantment, it is possible through a profound and costly ritual to imbue an item with the entire essence of a being. This process creates a sentient object, a vessel for a consciousness that is now inextricably linked to its new form.

The Imbuing Ritual:
The transference of a soul is a violent and inefficient process that requires an immense expenditure of entropic power.

The Cost: A ritualist must expend an amount of pure Entropy equal to 120% of the target entity's total Entropy Budget. This cost is permanent and represents the energy required to dissolve the entity's form and bind its essence to a new vessel. This must be done all at once or over time accruing entropy from the entity.

The Vessel: The target item must have an inherent "entropy capacity" sufficient to contain the entity's full budget. Mundane items like a simple dagger may not be able to contain the soul of a powerful being, while legendary artifacts might be crafted for this very purpose.

Mechanics of a Sentient Item:
An item imbued with an essence is, for all intents and purposes, a new character.

The Item Card: A sentient item has its own character sheet, with the imbued entity's TEP, ERR, and attributes. Its physical form is now the item itself.

Independent Will: The item has its own turn in combat and acts on its own will, though it may be wielded by another. Its goals may or may not align with its wielder's.

Durability & Mortality: A sentient item can repair minor damage to itself over time by spending its own EP. However, if the item is fundamentally destroyed, the entity within it is irrevocably annihilated.

The Extraction Ritual:
Removing an entity from its vessel is even more difficult than imbuing it. It requires 120% of the original imbuing cost (a total of 144% of the entity's original budget). A new host body or vessel must also be provided for the essence to inhabit. This process can be done with the entity's consent; otherwise, it is treated as a possession attempt, governed by the mind control rules.
