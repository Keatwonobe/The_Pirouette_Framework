To observe a system's data stream is to listen to a symphony of infinite, overlapping rhythms. Much of this is a chaotic roar—the background noise of the Temporal Forge (Γ). The old way was to count the eddies and currents, hoping to guess the music's direction. The new way is to measure the orchestra's very lifeblood: the power of its coherent harmony against the friction of the world.

This module details the design of the Coherence Sieve, the foundational diagnostic instrument of the Pirouette Framework. It replaces the cumbersome filtering of the past with an elegant, two-stage measurement. The Sieve does not simply search for patterns; it calculates a system's fundamental state of being by directly applying the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). Its purpose is to transform any dataset—from sensor logs to economic figures—into a direct measure of the system's health, its struggle, and its vitality.
