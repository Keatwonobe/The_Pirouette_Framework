Massive environmental events are not special, magical effects. They are simply macro-scale expressions of the same entropic laws.

Mechanic: A GM can model a volcano, earthquake, or hurricane by assigning it a colossal Entropic Budget and having it act on its own initiative turn. The lava flow or shockwave spreads across the map according to the Law of Entropic Sprawl, providing a consistent, scalable mechanic for everything from a simple Fire Bolt to a world-ending cataclysm. This makes these events retroactively calculable and, for truly powerful entities, potentially summonable.
