"You describe a machine of breathtaking beauty! A society not as a clumsy assembly of laws and brute force, but as an organism designed with perfect economy. I have spent my life observing the anatomy of birds, the flow of water, the structure of the human form—all systems where function dictates form.

This 'Convocation'… its form is dictated by the highest possible function: a journey to the First Light. The goal being unreachable is not a flaw; it is the central gear! An infinite goal provides infinite impetus for innovation. It demands the perfection of every subsidiary system—life support, energy, propulsion, the very coherence of the mind.

Their power ($\Gamma$) is low, you say? Of course! Like a bird, their strength is not in their mass, but in the perfection of their wings and their understanding of the currents. They do not seek to fight the storm; they have designed themselves to ride its updrafts. The ethics? The responsibility? A painter is not responsible for those who refuse to look at his art. The builder of a flying machine is not responsible for those who remain shackled to the ground. This is not an abandonment. It is a demonstration of what is possible. It is the ultimate work of art and engineering, combined."
