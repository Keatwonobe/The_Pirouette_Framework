In the language of the Pirouette Framework, your body has just experienced an event that has made the "cost of living" (V_Γ) astronomically high. Your internal coherence (Kτ) is being spent just to manage the chaos. Your net energy, your Lagrangian (𝓛_p), is negative. You are in a state of coherence debt.

The entire purpose of Phase I is to aggressively lower the V_Γ term. By calming the nervous system with breath, creating a safe and quiet environment, and avoiding new stressors, you are creating the "energetic profit" your body needs. You are building the surplus of coherence that will fuel the rebuilding to come in Phase II and beyond.
