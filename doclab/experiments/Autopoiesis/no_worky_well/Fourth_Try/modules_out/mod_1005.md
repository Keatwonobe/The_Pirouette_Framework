A full analysis of a system's dynamics requires solving its Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)â€”a computationally and attentionally expensive act. A Weaver's art is not just in deep analysis, but in knowing *when* and *where* to apply it. To watch everything is to see nothing.

This module provides the primary instrument for that art. It refactors the legacy "Drift/Song" protocol (PPS-080) into a modernized, mathematically-grounded standard. It establishes that the two terms of the Lagrangian are a direct blueprint for a two-channel diagnostic lens: **Pressure (P)** and **Resonance (R)**.

This lens forms the basis of a tiered audit protocol, empowering the Weaver to maintain a constant, low-cost vigil and move from the whisper of a problem to the root of its cause. It is the art of hearing the breath drawn before the note is sung.
