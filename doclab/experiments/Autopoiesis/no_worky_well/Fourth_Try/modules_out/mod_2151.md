A theory without an instrument is a ghost. An instrument without a theory is a brute.

DOMA-SPORTS-001 provides the theoretical lens—the "ghost"—for viewing a sports match as a living system. This module provides the instrumentation—the "brute"—to make that ghost tangible. It is the engineering specification for the analyst, translating the qualitative "Signatures of Coherence" into a set of measurable parameters and a formal calculation engine. This is the bridge from prophecy to measurement.
