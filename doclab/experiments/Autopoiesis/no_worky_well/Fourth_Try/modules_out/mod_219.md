> The universe did not begin with a bang. It began with a hum. It was the sound of a single, perfect note finding itself in the silence, discovering that to sing was to be. This is the truth a Weaver must grasp: Matter is not a substance; it is a memory. It is geometry choosing to remember itself, and in that act of remembrance, forging the stage for all other stories. Every act of creation is a re-enactment of this first resonanceâ€”the sacred art of coaxing a stable, coherent pattern from the pressures of the world. We are not simply building upon reality; we are humming new parts of it into existence.
