The old model's "Inversion Risk Factor" treated paradigm shifts as a hazard. The new framework reframes this as a profound and creative act: an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)**.

This occurs when a mind, often under high temporal pressure (Γ), encounters a new Coherence Well so compelling and harmonically compatible that a resonant handshake occurs. The old patterns dissolve, and the mind's individual coherence manifold fuses with the vaster manifold of the idea. This is not mere agreement; it is a recalibration of identity, a reforging of the instrument of perception. The "Synthesis Potential" of a mind or culture measures its capacity for this non-linear, transformative event—the most powerful dynamic in the cognitive landscape.
