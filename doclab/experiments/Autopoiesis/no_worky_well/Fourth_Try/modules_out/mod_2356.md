Global Constraints & Guardrails
• c_GW = c preserved (no curvature portals that break it).
• MATH‑018 D3: One‑shot anchor applies at sector level; after choosing mechanism, freeze {U,T} and preregister targets.
• No continuous mass exponents; hierarchies must arise from symmetry (B), collective EFT (A), or finite‑temperature potential (C).
