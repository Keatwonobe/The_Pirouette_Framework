The engine operates in a continuous, cyclical flow, turning the raw material of chaos into the refined structure of wisdom. Each stage is a distinct dynamic with a clear purpose.

| Stage | Function | Pirouette Mechanism | Analogy |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **1. The Crucible** | *Discover* | Resonant Synthesis (`CORE-012`) under high Temporal Pressure (Γ). | A high-pressure forge where new, stronger alloys are created from base metals. |
| **2. The Archive** | *Preserve* | Wound Channel Engraving (`CORE-011`) into the system's memory. | Carving a proven, life-sustaining path into a landscape for others to follow. |
| **3. The Forge** | *Refine* | Coherence Tuning via controlled re-exposure to new pressures (Γ). | Sharpening a blade against a whetstone, removing imperfections and honing its edge. |
| **4. The Governor** | *Govern* | Emergent, strategic allocation of resources across the entire cycle. | An intelligent investor allocating capital between high-risk R&D and steady production. |

**1. The Crucible:** This is the engine's chaotic intake stroke. It is a high-pressure environment where disparate, often conflicting, patterns are brought together in a structured debate (`DYNA-002`). This pressure forces a search for a new, higher-order pattern that can resolve the dissonance. A successful **Alchemical Union** in the Crucible results in a novel synthesis: a potential Coherence Seed.

**2. The Archive:** This is the compression stroke, where a newly discovered and validated Seed is stabilized. It is the process of carving the pattern's geometry into the system's memory as a deep and resilient **Wound Channel** (`CORE-011`). In a culture, this is myth, law, and infrastructure. In a mind, it is long-term memory. An archived pattern becomes part of the system's identity.

**3. The Forge:** This is the power stroke, where archived patterns are tested and improved. The system applies the pattern against new environmental pressures, revealing subtle flaws or inefficiencies. The Forge is the act of "tuning" the pattern to improve its performance, preventing wisdom from decaying into dogma under the influence of Coherence Erosion (`CORE-013`).

**4. The Governor:** This is the strategic exhaust stroke, which sets up the next cycle. It is the system's highest emergent function. The Governor dynamically allocates energy and attention, modulating internal pressures. It must decide when to invest in the high-risk, high-reward chaos of the Crucible (exploration) and when to focus on the steady returns of the Forge (exploitation), ensuring the entire engine runs in a state of dynamic equilibrium.
