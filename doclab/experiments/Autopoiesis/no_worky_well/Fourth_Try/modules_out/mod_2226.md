A theory, no matter how elegant, is a ghost until it makes contact with the world. The preceding nine modules have erected a cathedral of abstract reason. This module gives that cathedral its foundation in the bedrock of empirical reality.

Here, we consolidate the mathematical machinery of the framework into a set of concrete, quantitative, and falsifiable predictions. We will provide the explicit protocol for recovering the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) from the geometric principles of the "coherence echo." Furthermore, we will establish the dashboards and validation suites that connect every major theorem of the MATH series to a corresponding experimental test, forging an unbreakable link between this theory and the world it claims to describe. This is the moment the framework shows its teeth.
