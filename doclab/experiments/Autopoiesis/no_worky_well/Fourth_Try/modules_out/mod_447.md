This protocol is not merely a static format; it is designed to fuel an autopoietic, self-improving cycle of inquiry. The unification of `observation` and `simulation` data streams enables a powerful feedback loop:

1.  **Observation:** A human-led ritual is performed, generating a stream of `observation` records that capture the system's real-world behavior.
2.  **Calibration:** This real-world data is used to seed, tune, and validate a computational model of the system.
3.  **Simulation:** The model runs, generating a stream of `simulation` records that explore possibilities beyond the reach of direct observation.
4.  **Analysis:** Both data streams, being in the same format, are fed into a single analytical engine (e.g., `INST-NALY-001: The Coherence Auditor`).
5.  **Insight:** The analysis reveals deeper truths about the system's dynamics, which in turn informs the design of the next ritual and refines the parameters of the next simulation.

Data begets insight, which begets better data. The act of logging becomes an engine for its own refinement.
