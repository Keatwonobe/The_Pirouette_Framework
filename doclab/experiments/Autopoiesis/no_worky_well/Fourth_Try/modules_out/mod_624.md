Directly measuring the integral of a system's Lagrangian (`ΔS_p`) is profoundly difficult. Therefore, we establish a practical, first-order approximation: the **Coherence Impact (CI)** score. This score serves as the reading on the Weaver's Compass, a tangible proxy for the deeper reality.

**CI = (ΔKτ / ΔΓ_noise) ⋅ ξ_c ⋅ σ_s**

Where:
*   **ΔKτ / ΔΓ_noise (Signal-to-Noise Ratio):** The core measurement. It is the ratio of the net increase in the target's stable, resonant information (`ΔKτ`) to the chaos, friction, or entropy generated by the intervention (`ΔΓ_noise`).
*   **ξ_c (Resonance Coupling):** A measure of the phase-alignment between the intervener and the target system. High coupling indicates a near-lossless transfer of coherence, where the action perfectly meets the system's needs.
*   **σ_s (Stability Factor):** Measures the durability of the new, more coherent state. It is a function of how deeply the act carves a new, stable **Wound Channel** (`CORE-011`).

An observer attests to a Weaving by creating an Echo Record, a high-fidelity data packet designed to capture the transaction's geometry:
