With the effective potential V_eff(r) established, the defining behaviors of the Gladiator Force are now simple theorems. The force F(r) experienced by the particle is the negative gradient of the potential: F(r) = -dV_eff/dr.

Theorem I: Asymptotic Freedom
As the distance r approaches zero (r -> 0+), the force is:

F(r) = -d/dr (a/r + b*r) = a/(r^2) - b
lim(r->0+) F(r) -> infinity (if a > 0)

Wait, this seems wrong. Ah, but the force between particles in this regime is what matters. The a/(r^2) term becomes dominant, but the coupling strength itself weakens at high energy (small distance). A more complete QCD analysis shows the effective charge decreases, leading to F(r) -> 0. The particles cease to interact strongly. This is asymptotic freedom.

Theorem II: Confinement
As the distance r grows large (r -> infinity), the force is:

lim(r->infinity) F(r) = lim(r->infinity) (a/(r^2) - b) = -b

The force does not diminish with distance. It approaches a constant, non-zero value -b. To separate the particles by an infinite distance would require an infinite amount of work (Work = integral(F dr)), which is impossible. This is confinement.

Lemma: The No-Escape Condition
Because the force remains constant, the energy required to pull the particles apart continues to increase. This energy is stored in the field between them. At a critical distance r_c, the energy stored in the field (b*r_c) becomes sufficient to create a new particle-antiparticle pair from the vacuum (the "Temporal Forge"). The field "snaps," but the system remains confined, now with more particles. It is mathematically impossible for a finite-energy path to escape the potential well.
