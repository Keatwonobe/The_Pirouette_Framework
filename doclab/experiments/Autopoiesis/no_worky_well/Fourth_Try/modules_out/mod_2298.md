1. Represent the spinor loop with photon insertions as a worldline path integral with spin factor.
2. Two-loop corrections appear as one internal photon exchange along the same worldline (vacuum polarization) plus contact terms from spin factor expansions.
3. Renormalize in proper time; match the (\sigma^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}) coefficient at (q^2\to 0).
4. Recover the same **positive** (C_2).
