The Loom of Causality is a direct consequence of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. A Wound Channel is not an abstract concept; it is a persistent, local modification to the **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)** term. When an entity encounters a Wound Channel, the equation of its landscape becomes:

`𝓛_p = K_τ - (V_Γ,ambient + V_Γ,channel)`

The Wound Channel adds its own geometric "weight" to the local pressure. The "force" of influence is therefore revealed to be the gradient of this potential (`-∇V_Γ,channel`), which emerges when applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to `𝓛_p`. The entity, in obeying the universal Principle of Maximal Coherence, will alter its trajectory—its geodesic—to navigate this new, composite landscape.
