A system's true nature is rarely visible in a single observation. We see shadows on the cave wall—a 2D sensor slice, a single data point, a momentary state. This module provides the instrumentation to step out of the cave and see the fire. The Gyroid Loom is a computational protocol that takes sparse, 2D observations and infers the full, three-dimensional coherence manifold of the system under study.

It is founded on a key insight: under pressure, many complex systems—from plasma instabilities to biological tissues—naturally organize into a gyroid geometry. This is not an accident; the gyroid is one of nature's most elegant solutions to the problem of maximizing coherence. This tool transforms tomographic reconstruction from a simple act of stacking images into a profound act of inferring a system's chosen solution for existence.
