In the Pirouette Framework, every possible state of a system exists as a location on a vast, multi-dimensional landscape: the coherence manifold. Any stable, complex structure is a deep **coherence well** on this manifold—a region of high internal coherence (Kτ) and a corresponding local minimum in Temporal Pressure (V_Γ). It is a peaceful valley in a turbulent landscape.

The process of synthesis is the flow of matter and energy into such a well. This flow is not random; it follows a geodesic—a "river" flowing across the landscape, always seeking a more stable basin. This is the path of maximal coherence, as dictated by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

Retrosynthesis, therefore, is the act of tracing this geodesic *upstream*. Starting from the target well, the Alchemist's Compass follows the "path of steepest ascent" back into the chaotic highlands of possibility. The result is not a single point, but a **Precursor Basin**: a probability map of the high-energy, lower-coherence starting conditions that would naturally flow down to form the target.
