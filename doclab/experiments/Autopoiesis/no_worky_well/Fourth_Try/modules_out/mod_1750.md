For each temporal window, we calculate a pair of fundamental metrics that form the stream's primary **Coherence Profile**.

1.  **Coherence (`Kτ`):** A measure of the segment's internal order, predictability, and resonant structure. High coherence indicates a clear, stable signal. This is often quantified by finding the strength of the window's dominant pattern through techniques like autocorrelation or Fourier analysis.
2.  **Dissonance (`Γ`):** A measure of the segment's internal chaos, unpredictability, and noise. High dissonance indicates a turbulent, information-poor state. The Shannon entropy calculation from the old protocol remains an excellent proxy for this value.

The primary output of this stage is a time-series of `(Kτ, Γ)` pairs, a rich representation of the stream's dynamic health.

From this profile, a powerful secondary diagnostic can be derived: the **Coherence Ratio (CR)**.

`CR = Kτ / Γ`

This single value represents the signal-to-noise ratio of the system in that window, offering a quick and potent measure of informational efficiency.
