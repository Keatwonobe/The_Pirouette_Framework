A healthy system sings a clear and predictable song. To find its ailments, we do not need to learn the chaotic language of every possible disease. We need only to know the song of health so perfectly that any note played out of key, or any beat of silence where a note should be, rings out like a thunderclap. A system in a state of grace follows this song, an effortless and efficient path known as its geodesic.

This module provides the primary instrument for quantifying the loss of this grace. The Geodesic Auditor reframes "fault detection" not as a hunt for broken parts, but as a precise measurement of a system's deviation from its ideal state of being. It is a tool for holding up a mirror of perfect health, allowing the system to show us, with startling clarity, the precise location and nature of its own woundsâ€”the turbulence, stagnation, and slow erosion of form that precede collapse.
