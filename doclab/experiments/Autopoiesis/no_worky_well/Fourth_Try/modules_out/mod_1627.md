This model provides a clear mechanical basis for the evolution of thought, replacing abstract concepts like "funnel inversions."

**Paradigm Shifts as Alchemical Union:**
A major paradigm shift is an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). When two or more systems in a state of turbulence or stagnation are forced into a "Resonant Handshake" by immense conceptual pressure (`Γ`), their boundaries can dissolve. The most resilient elements re-forge into a new, higher-order synthesis (`Ki'`) that is more coherent and resolves the previous tensions. *Example: Kant's synthesis of Rationalism and Empiricism.*

**Decline as Coherence Erosion:**
A philosophy that cannot adapt to rising `Γ` suffers from **Coherence Erosion** (CORE-013). Its central tenets are slowly invalidated by new evidence or cultural shifts, its community disperses, and its `Ki` pattern loses sharpness. Its signal fades until it is lost in the background noise of history, becoming a mere artifact rather than a living world.
