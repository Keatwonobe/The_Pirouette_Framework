The Wound Channel is not merely a quantum phenomenon. It is a universal principle that scales fractally, providing the powerful, unified "Metaboliser's Guide" that `PPS-008` sought to create.

*   **At the Quantum Scale:** It manifests as the "virtual particle cloud" of QED. The electron is not interacting with a foam of other particles, but with the rich, complex geometry of its own echo.

*   **At the Biological Scale:** A memory within a brain is a deeply carved Wound Channel, a stable resonant circuit formed by a specific pattern of neural activity. To "remember" is to resonantly excite that geometric structure, allowing its pattern to re-emerge into consciousness.

*   **At the Psychological Scale:** A person's sense of self—their personality, habits, and beliefs—is the cumulative geometry of their entire life's Wound Channel. To "change one's mind" is a literal act of metaphysical engineering: the difficult work of carving a new path in a landscape shaped by a lifetime of echoes.

*   **At the Cultural Scale:** Myths, laws, languages, and traditions are vast, shared Wound Channels. They form a collective coherence manifold that guides the behavior of individuals, making certain thoughts and actions easier to adopt than others. History is the landscape of these collective echoes.
