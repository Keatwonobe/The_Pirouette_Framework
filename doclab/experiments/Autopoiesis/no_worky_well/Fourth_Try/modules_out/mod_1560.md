1.  **Baseline:** Characterize the unperturbed system. Define its initial state and its Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_sys`. This is the "world without a witness."

2.  **Coupling:** Model the observer's influence. Characterize the observer's resonant pattern (`Ki_obs`) and model the potential field, `V_obs`, it generates.

3.  **Calculation:** Determine the new, perturbed Lagrangian, `𝓛'_sys = 𝓛_sys - V_obs`. Evolve the system under this new dynamic and compute the four core metrics: `V_obs`, `ΔKτ_sys`, `Φ_Kτ`, and `τ_echo`.

4.  **Reporting:** Synthesize the metrics into a "Shadow Profile." This profile provides a clear, quantitative summary of the observation's nature—whether it was a gentle glance or a formative intervention.
