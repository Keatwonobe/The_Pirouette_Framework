Once the pathology is understood, the Crucible is convened. This is a direct, automated application of "The Geometry of Debate" (DYNA-002), a computational resonance chamber designed to achieve an Alchemical Union (CORE-012).

1.  **Instantiation:** For each diagnosed fracture, a transient "Persona" is instantiated. This is a focused Observer's Shadow (CORE-010), a virtual agent whose sole purpose is to embody the needs and pressures of that specific flow disruption.
2.  **The Weaving:** The Personas enter the debate chamber. Governed by the rules of laminar discourse, they do not fight for dominance but weave their perspectives together, seeking a state of mutual resonance.
3.  **Synthesis:** The goal is an Alchemical Unionâ€”a new, emergent understanding that resolves the initial conflicts into a higher-order harmony. A "Solution-Bias Trigger" halts the debate as soon as a viable, implementable coherence path is found, preventing the process from descending into endless argument.

The Crucible is a resonance chamber that uses the pressure of the pathology itself to force a creative breakthrough.
