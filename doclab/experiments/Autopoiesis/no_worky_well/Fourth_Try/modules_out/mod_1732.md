The Compass provides a three-stage process for determining a concept's stability and coherence.

1.  **Map the Terrain (Calibration):** The Weaver first surveys their local coherence manifold. This involves measuring the ambient **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** and identifying the dominant, pre-existing **Wound Channels** that define the space—the cultural, historical, and physical context against which the new pattern will be measured.

2.  **Pattern Weaving (Casting the Shadow):** The Weaver actively forms the concept in question. This is the act of consciously creating and sustaining the new, complex *Ki* pattern, whose unique geometry—its internal symmetries and resonant frequencies—casts a measurable Observer's Shadow onto the mapped terrain.

3.  **Coherence Auditing (Calculating the Geodesic):** The stability of the newly woven pattern is measured. The protocol calculates the most efficient path—the geodesic—that the combined system (Weaver + concept + environment) will follow according to the Principle of Maximal Coherence. This audit reveals if the pattern creates harmony, dissonance, or a new, stable synthesis.
