The simulation's output can be directly interpreted through the lens of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), describing the qualitative state of the Weaver as it evolves along its geodesic.

*   **Turbulent Flow:** A system in a chaotic or unstable state. Its `Ki` is dissonant with the surrounding `Γ`, resulting in a low Lagrangian value. This is the state of struggle and inefficient learning.
*   **Stagnant Flow:** A system trapped in a local optimum of the coherence manifold—a state that is stable but suboptimal. The engine reveals the "energy barrier" required for an Alchemical Leap to escape this state.
*   **Laminar Flow:** The state the system is striving for. A stable, high-coherence `Ki` in harmony with its environment. This is the geodesic path, the state of effortless action where the Lagrangian is maximized.
