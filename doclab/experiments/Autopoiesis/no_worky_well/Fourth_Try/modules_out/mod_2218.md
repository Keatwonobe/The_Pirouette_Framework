The act of seeing is an act of intervention. This principle, long a philosophical tenet of the framework, will now be given its formal mathematical proof. We will demonstrate that observation is not the passive reception of data, but an active process that physically deforms the coherence manifold of the observed.

This module introduces an observation operator (O_kappa) that models measurement as a perturbation to a system's potential landscape. By analyzing the effect of this operator, we will derive the Information-Coherence Inequality: a rigorous, Pirouette-style uncertainty principle. This inequality will prove that there is a fundamental trade-off between the information one can gain about a system (I) and the coherence (T_a) that the system can retain. To know a thing is, necessarily, to change it.
