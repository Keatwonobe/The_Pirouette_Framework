The goal is not to abandon your current life in a desperate leap toward a fantasy. The goal is integration. A **Resonance Bridge** is a series of small, deliberate, low-cost actions designed to weave the coherence of a latent path into the fabric of your present reality.

If the "artist" path resonates strongly, the bridge is not to quit your job and move to a loft. It is to buy a sketchbook and draw for fifteen minutes a day. If the "adventurer" echo is loud, the bridge is to plan a challenging weekend hike, not to sell your house and buy a sailboat.

These actions are **Coherence Probes**: experiments that allow you to safely draw energy and information from the latent path. Over time, these small bridges can transform your current geodesic, not by replacing it, but by enriching it into a new, more fulfilling synthesis.
