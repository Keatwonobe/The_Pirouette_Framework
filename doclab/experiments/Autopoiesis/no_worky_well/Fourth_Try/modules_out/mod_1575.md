A skill is not a thing an agent *possesses*, but a *path* they can navigate within the landscape of their own being.

-   **The Unskilled State:** For the novice, the terrain of a new skill is a turbulent wilderness. Every action is a struggle against a chaotic environment. The path is undefined, requiring immense conscious effort and energy to blaze. In the language of the framework, this is a path of high temporal pressure and low coherence.

-   **The Mastered State:** For the master, the terrain has been transformed. The chaotic wilderness is now home to a deep, stable, and elegant grooveâ€”a well-carved Wound Channel (`CORE-011`). This groove is a geodesic, a path of maximal coherence. To perform the skill is to simply "fall" into this channel and follow its effortless contour. This is the physical basis for the experience of "muscle memory" or "effortless action."

The transition from one state to the other is a process of deliberate transformation. It proceeds in three stages:

1.  **The Initial Deviation:** The first attempt at a new skill is an act of will, forcing the flow of coherence away from established channels. This is inefficient and effortful, a state of high friction and **Turbulent Flow** (`DYNA-001`).
2.  **Resonant Repetition:** Each subsequent, focused repetition traverses this new, faint path. The system's resonance leaves a geometric echo, deepening the channel with every pass.
3.  **The Emergence of Mastery:** This is the tipping point where the new Wound Channel becomes so deep and well-defined that it supersedes old habits. The skill now feels "natural" as the turbulent struggle resolves into graceful efficiency.
