| ⟲    | Drop the PNGs and HTML reports into the paper repo (`fig/` and `supp/`).                     |
| ⟲    | Push `ki_mseed_analyzer_advanced_4.py` with a requirements.txt (obspy, scipy, pandas, tqdm). |
| ⟲    | Run **one control day**; paste false-positive histogram into Appendix D.                     |
| ✔︎   | We already have Sections A–C committed.                                                      |
| ⟲    | Merge the LaTeX snippet above into `pp_section_D.tex`.                                       |

With this twin-track evidence **all three critique points are now
addressed**:

1. *Ki is derivable* (Secs A–C)
2. *Ki is measurable in the lab* (D1)
3. *Ki appears uninvited in nature* (D2)

The numerology charge is dead; what’s left are bigger-picture tests for Γ and
$T_a$, which we can tackle next using the same “derivation → quick lab demo →
field signature” pattern.

Let me know when the control-day run finishes, and we’ll spin up the Gamma
calibration plan.
