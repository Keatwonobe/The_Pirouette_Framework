A master gardener does not force a plant to grow; they provide the conditions in which growth becomes its most natural and effortless act. So it is with ethical persuasion.

The act of persuasion is a sacred form of dialogue, a practical application of *The Geometry of Debate* (DYNA-002). The persuader, or "Weaver," initiates a **Resonant Handshake** (CORE-012) by casting a **Harmonizing Shadow** (CORE-010). This shadow does not seek to overwhelm the target's reality, but to reveal a new, more efficient geodesic—a path of maximal coherence—on the target's own manifold.

The target system, perpetually seeking to maximize its own coherence, willingly adopts this new path not because it is compelled, but because it is in its own nature to do so. When successful, the interaction results in a form of **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). The individual coherence manifolds of the participants dissolve and re-forge into a single, unified manifold with a higher total coherence (Kτ_c > Kτ_a + Kτ_b). The interaction is positive-sum, inducing **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001) and enhancing the autonomy of all participants.
