Every substance in the world has a limit to the amount of entropic force it can contain before its nature is fundamentally altered. This is its Entropic Capacity (EC).

Mechanic: A GM can assign a default EC to any 5-foot cube of a substance (e.g., Air: 10, Water: 20, Earth: 30, Stone: 50).

Entropic Ablation: If the total EP from a single damage type invested in a square in one round exceeds its EC, the square undergoes Ablation. The substance is consumed or transformed. Superheated air might become a temporary vacuum. Earth might turn to molten slag. Water might flash into superheated steam. This creates dynamic, lasting changes to the battlefield.
