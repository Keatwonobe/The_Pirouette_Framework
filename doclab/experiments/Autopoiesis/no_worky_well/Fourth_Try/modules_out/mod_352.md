Coherence Risk is a predictive metric (0–1 scale) that estimates the potential degradation of a system's health. It is the practical instrument for gauging the "coherence cost" an action might impose. It is a weighted function of the three core geometric factors:

$$ R_κ = w_ρ ρ + w_δ δ + w_ω ω $$

Where **ρ**, **δ**, and **ω** are normalized scores (0-1) and **w** are the currently calibrated weights for Reach, Dissonance, and Wound Channel Depth. This equation provides a clear, quantitative estimate of an action's potential to introduce destructive turbulence into the universal song.
