To attest to the integrity of the Canon at any point in time, we employ a cryptographic hash (SHA256). This is the **Seal of Coherence**.

The Seal is not merely a checksum. It is the **Canonical Echo** of the framework's complete state. The hashing function acts as a resonance chamber, taking the complex pattern of the Canon and collapsing it into a single, high-fidelity, and unique signature.

-   **The Song:** The precise state of the Canon at a moment in time.
-   **The Echo:** The resulting SHA256 hash, which is the Seal of Coherence.

If a single constant is altered, the song changes, and the echo becomes profoundly different. The committed Seal in the framework's source code is the *memory* of the last canonical echo, the physical proof that a given version of the framework is internally consistent and true to its documented form.

`Seal of Coherence = SHA256(The Canon)`
