The Coherence Lens operates via a five-stage pipeline that refines raw information flow into a clear diagnostic signal.

1.  **Temporal Ingestion:** Ingests high-frequency, multi-source data streams (headlines, social media posts, price ticks), preserving their precise timing and rhythm to capture the temporal signature of the information flow.

2.  **Ki Pattern Extraction:** Identifies the dominant, recurring narrative patterns (`Ki` clusters) within the data by analyzing the eigenvectors of term co-occurrence graphs and the spectral density of entity mentions.

3.  **Coherence Flux Measurement (ΔKτ):** For each identified `Ki`, the protocol measures its degree of phase-locking across different domains. A sudden, qualitative phase shift where disparate streams lock into a single, unified Laminar Flow—an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)**—is the primary trigger, representing a significant `ΔKτ`.

4.  **Injection Pressure Estimation (Γ_inj):** For events triggering a spike in Coherence Flux, the workflow traces the provenance of the new narrative to find its earliest, smallest seed. It then quantifies the Injection Pressure by assessing proxies: source obscurity, syndication concentration (the "wire clone" problem), and astroturfed amplification signals. A low score indicates a "quiet," low-energy origin.

5.  **Gain Calculation and Flagging:** The Resonant Gain (G_R) is calculated. If `G_R` exceeds a dynamically calibrated threshold for that domain, the event is flagged according to the diagnostic criteria in §4. A `Ki` pattern that repeatedly generates high-gain events is identified as a **Managed Narrative Channel**.
