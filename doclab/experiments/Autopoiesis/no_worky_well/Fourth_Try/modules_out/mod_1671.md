A system's Geodesic Blueprint is its path of maximal coherence. It is the "null template" against which all real-world performance is measured, and it can be derived in three primary ways:

*   **From First Principles:** For simple systems, the ideal flow can be calculated directly from its defining parameters, representing the optimal solution to its Pirouette Lagrangian.
*   **From History:** For complex systems, the blueprint can be constructed from high-fidelity data recorded during a known period of peak health and performance.
*   **From Simulation:** The blueprint can be generated by a model that simulates the system operating under ideal, frictionless conditions.
