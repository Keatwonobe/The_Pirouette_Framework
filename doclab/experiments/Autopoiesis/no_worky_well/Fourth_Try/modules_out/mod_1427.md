One can measure a mountain by its height, its volume, or the steepness of its slopes. These are all different measurements, yet they describe the same mountain. The old framework, `TEN-ITPA-1.0`, correctly identified this principle in classical thermodynamics: that the primary potentials (U, F, H, G) are merely different views of the same underlying system state.

This module refactors that insight from first principles. It demonstrates that classical thermodynamics is not a parallel system to be mapped onto Pirouette; it is an emergent consequence of it. The thermodynamic potentials are distinct accounting methods for a single, underlying dynamic: a systemâ€™s relentless effort, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, to preserve its internal coherence against the dissipative pressure of its environment. The Legendre transforms are not mere mathematical tricks; they are the tools for navigating this unified state, revealing how to calculate a system's "coherence-for-work" after paying its inevitable tax to chaos.
