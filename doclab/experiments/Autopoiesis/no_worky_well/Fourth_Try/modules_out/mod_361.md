The core of the gambit is a predictive calculation. The output is the **Dissonance Index (ΔK)**, a single metric that quantifies the predicted impact of an interaction on the system's coherence. A high ΔK signals a dissonant, anti-harmonic signature where engagement would lead to a net loss of coherence.

The Dissonance Index is estimated by analyzing the properties of the inbound signal, or "Dissonant Injection":

| Signal Property       | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase Mismatch**    | The input's resonant cycle is significantly out of phase with the system's own, threatening to create destructive interference.                    |
| **Dissonance Spike**  | The input is a carrier of high-entropy noise, threatening to chaotically increase local Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) and induce `Turbulent Flow`. |
| **Coherence Attack**  | The input's structure is actively anti-coherent; its very pattern is designed to degrade the `Time Adherence` (coherence) of the receiver.       |

At interpersonal and societal scales, these properties manifest as recognizable behaviors that signal a high ΔK:

-   **Turbulent Attack:** The signal employs bad-faith arguments, ad hominem attacks, or logical fallacies, designed not to build shared understanding but to shatter it.
-   **Stagnant Dam:** The signal is a rigid, absolutist position impervious to new information. It is not a thread offered for weaving, but a wall built to halt it, inducing `Coherence Atrophy`.
