1. **Triadic Phase Coupling Index (TPCI):**
   [\text{TPCI} = |\langle e^{i(\Phi_3 - \Phi_1 - \Phi_2)} \rangle|]
   Measures stability of the triadic phase relationship.

2. **Coherence Area Variance (CAV):**
   [\text{CAV} = \text{Var}(\mathcal{A}_{Ki})]
   Should approach zero during sustained conscious report.

3. **Gamma-Load Detuning Function:**
   [\Delta f_{allowed} \propto \Gamma^{-1/2}]
   Predicts narrowing of viable frequency triads under high cognitive load.
