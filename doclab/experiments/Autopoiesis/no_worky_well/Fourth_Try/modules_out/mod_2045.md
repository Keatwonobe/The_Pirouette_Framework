summary: "Designs and tests a force-free actuator whose “thrust” is generated by asymmetric observation.
  A coherent electron beam passes a triadic aperture and weak which-way sensors are enabled
  asymmetrically. The change in information flow reshapes interference, creating a measurable
  momentum imbalance that pushes a nanocantilever “sail.” The device demonstrates that directed
  work can be produced by modulating local coherence and observer geometry—without adding a net
  classical force to the plant—while remaining thermodynamically honest (information costs paid
  in the meter chain)."
