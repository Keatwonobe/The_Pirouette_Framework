A tamed beast is a companion, but a bonded beast is family. Forging a Soul Bond is a profound act of sacrifice and trust.

The Cost: To form a Soul Bond, a tamer must willingly and permanently invest a portion of their own TEP equal to the full Entropy Budget of the beast. This TEP is removed from the tamer and woven into the beast's soul, creating an unbreakable link.

The Benefits:

Shared Power: The tamer can now directly invest their own TEP into the bonded creature's attributes or skills without the 20% "Pact" tax.

Resurrection: If the bonded creature is killed, the tamer can perform an hour-long ritual to restore it to life, spending their own EP to reform its body. However, if a creature is destroyed by taking damage equal to its full Entropy Budget, it is annihilated and cannot be recovered.

The Burden: A tamer's focus is divided. For each bonded creature that follows them, one point of their Entropy Regeneration Rate (ERR) is dedicated to supporting that creature's needs. A tamer with three bonded beasts and an ERR of 4 would only regenerate 1 EP for themselves per round.

Familiars: A creature designated as a Familiar does not impose this ERR burden, but it cannot take the Attack action. If it does, it is considered a Guardian and immediately imposes the ERR cost. This is irreversible.
