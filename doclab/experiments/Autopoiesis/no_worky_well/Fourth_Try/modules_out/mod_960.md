The old framework rewarded an agent for the duration of its coherence. This was a correct intuition but an indirect implementation. The new framework reveals the direct, causal engine: an agent's fundamental, pre-cognitive drive is to find a path of action that maximizes the integral of its **Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)** over time.

𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence `Kτ`) - (Temporal Pressure `V_Γ`)

Survival is the score that measures how well the agent is playing this game. An agent that finds a behavioral pattern—a `Ki`—that generates high internal coherence for a low environmental cost will naturally persist. It does not learn *to* survive; it learns to resonate, and survival is the consequence of a song well-played.
