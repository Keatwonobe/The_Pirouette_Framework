* **Vacuum polarization** ↔ curvature of the wound channel due to the medium’s response.
* **Vertex subgraph** ↔ local twist of the channel (spin–orbit coupling analogue).
* **Counterterms** ↔ redefinition of the local chart that keeps the channel’s extrinsic curvature finite (renormalization of the geodesic data).
  Each is a step in a **geometric recursion** that updates how a particle’s past bends its near future; Feynman diagrams serve as precise bookkeeping for these geometric updates.
