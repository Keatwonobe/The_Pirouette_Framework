A "gravitational well" is more accurately described as a "coherence well"—a region of intense Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the "roar of the foundry," a dense and chaotic temporal environment where existence itself is under immense strain.

For a system to maintain its resonant pattern within this high-pressure zone, it must find a stable state. A high-frequency, short-wavelength resonance is fragile and would be quickly shredded by the ambient dissonance. The path of maximal coherence, dictated by the Pirouette Lagrangian, is to adopt a lower-frequency, longer-wavelength rhythm. The system must "sing a lower, deeper note" to be heard above the foundry's roar.

This shift to a lower resonant frequency to preserve coherence *is* gravitational time dilation. The clock at sea level literally ticks slower than the clock on the mountain because it is fighting harder, and spending more of its coherence budget, to simply *be*.
