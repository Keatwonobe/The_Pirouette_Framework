[|\psi| \propto (T_c - T_a)^{\beta_P}]

Define Pirouette exponents as:

* **(\alpha_P)** — coherence heat exponent (variance of (\Gamma))
* **(\beta_P)** — order parameter growth
* **(\gamma_P)** — susceptibility to external Ki perturbation
* **(\delta_P)** — nonlinear response of (\psi) to field drive

Derived from mean-field approximation:
[\alpha_P = 0,\ \beta_P = 1/2,\ \gamma_P = 1,\ \delta_P = 3]

These define the **Pirouette universality class**, mirroring Landau exponents but extended to multi-scale coherence systems where substrate couplings preserve resonance invariants.
