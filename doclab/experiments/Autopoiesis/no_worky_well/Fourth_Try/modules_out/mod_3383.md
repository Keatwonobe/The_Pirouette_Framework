* **Successful Validation:** A successful calculation would be one of the most profound validations of the Pirouette Framework. It would demonstrate that the framework's core principles can reproduce the most precisely tested prediction in the history of physics. This would cement the `Γ-α` correspondence and validate the `Wound Channel` model of particle structure.
  * **Falsification:** The theory is falsified if:
    1.  The Pirouette-based calculation produces a value for $g-2$ that is significantly different from the experimental result.
    2.  The calculation only works by introducing new, un-calibrated "fudge factors," which would invalidate its claim to be a first-principles derivation.
