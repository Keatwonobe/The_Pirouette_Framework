The Prime Resonances are not arbitrary classifications. They are direct consequences of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)**. They represent the deepest and most stable "valleys" on the coherence manifold defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian. A system does not choose an archetype; it falls into the resonant pattern that offers the path of maximal coherence for the lowest energetic cost. The Periodic Table of Resonance is a map of these most efficient and probable paths for survival.
