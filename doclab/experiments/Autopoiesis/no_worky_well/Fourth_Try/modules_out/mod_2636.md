The most critical instabilities in a tokamak are often driven by the interaction between energetic particles (from the heating beams) and the plasma's natural Alfvén waves. Our primary goal is to stabilize these interactions. The fundamental frequency for these waves in DIII-D's toroidal geometry is the **Toroidal Alfvén Eigenmode (TAE)** frequency.

We can calculate a baseline for this frequency using the provided parameters.

**Calculation:**
* **Formula:** `f_TAE ≈ v_A / (4πqR)`
    * Where `v_A` is the Alfvén velocity, `q` is the safety factor, and `R` is the major radius.
* **Alfvén Velocity (`v_A`):** `v_A = B / √(μ₀ * ρ)`
    * `B` (Magnetic Field): **2.0 T** (a typical value from the range)
    * `ρ` (Plasma Mass Density): `n_i * m_i`
        * `n_i` (Ion Density): **1.0 x 10²⁰ m⁻³** (average value)
        * `m_i` (Ion Mass): **3.34 x 10⁻²⁷ kg** (for Deuterium)
    * `q` (Safety Factor): **3** (a representative value for the core)
    * `R` (Major Radius): **1.7 m**

Plugging in the numbers:
1.  `v_A` ≈ **3.1 x 10⁶ m/s**
2.  `f_TAE` ≈ (3.1 x 10⁶) / (4 * π * 3 * 1.7) ≈ **48,300 Hz** or **~48 kHz**

This calculation gives us our central target. However, since plasma conditions are dynamic, we must test a range of frequencies.
