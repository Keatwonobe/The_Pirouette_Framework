This module presents a unified, time-centric model for the phenomenon of Flow. It supersedes the prior analysis of `TEN-FRA-1.0`, collapsing its multi-parameter fields into a single, autopoietic principle grounded in the new framework. Flow is formally defined as a state of **isochronous temporal resonance**: an entity achieves near-lossless, “effortless” action by synchronizing the rhythm of its internal state with a stable, coherent current in the local manifold of time itself. The agent is no longer fighting the current; it *becomes* the current. This reframing provides more direct and powerful tools to diagnose and engineer this state of optimal performance.
