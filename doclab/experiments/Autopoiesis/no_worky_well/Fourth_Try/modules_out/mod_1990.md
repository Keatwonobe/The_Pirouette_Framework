This now becomes your most powerful tool for motivation.

The Practice: Continue to log your two numbers daily:

The Body's Voice: Resting Heart Rate.

The Mind's Voice: Your subjective "Flow Score" (1-10).

The New Step: Chart Your Course. At the end of each week, plot these two numbers on a simple line graph. You will create a visual record of your healing. On days when you feel discouraged, this chart becomes the undeniable proof of your journey.

Helper's Role (The Scribe & Analyst): You are the keeper of this chart. Your most important job is to be the storyteller of the data. At the end of the week, sit with the patient and show them the graph. Say, "Look. This is where you started. Look how much your heart rate has calmed. Look how your 'flow' is climbing. You are doing this." This act of witnessing is a profound gift.
