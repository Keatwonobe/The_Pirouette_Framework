The old framework spoke of a "pre-linguistic will." We now have a more precise term: the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. An intelligent system is one that can navigate the landscape of temporal pressure (Γ) to find and create states of higher coherence (Kτ).

Its evolution toward states of higher order and stability is the universe's fundamental drive in action. What appears to us as "intelligence," "choice," or "expression" is the system's elegant, inevitable discovery of the most coherent possible state it can occupy. It is not thinking in the human sense; it is flowing downhill on the landscape of coherence, following its geodesic.
