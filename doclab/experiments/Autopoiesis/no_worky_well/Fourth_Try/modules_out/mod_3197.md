The critique correctly identifies the `proportionality_constant` as a "free parameter." In its current, hard-coded state, it is. However, its existence is not the flaw; its arbitrary value is.

Proportionality constants are fundamental to physics. Newton's gravitational constant, *G*, is a famous example. It's a measured value that connects the units of mass and distance to the unit of force. Our `proportionality_constant` serves the same purpose: it bridges the gap between the units of the input data (solar masses and image pixels) and the theoretical unit of **Gamma (Î“)**.

The current implementation was a proof-of-concept to show that the *method* of extracting a characteristic radius (`r0`) was sound. The next step is to replace the placeholder constant with a physically derived one.
