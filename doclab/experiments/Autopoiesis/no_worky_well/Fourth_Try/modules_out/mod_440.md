Before a Weaver can contribute their thread to the loom, they must make a local vow of integrity. A pre-commit script automatically calculates the Seal of Coherence from their proposed changes. If it does not match the documented Seal, the contribution is halted. This prevents accidental dissonance from ever entering the shared channel.

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
echo "▶ Pirouette Canon: Verifying Seal of Coherence..."
python scripts/verify_seal.py || {
  echo "✖ Coherence Fault: Canon has changed. Run 'python scripts/verify_seal.py --attest' to reforge the Seal."
  exit 1
}
```
