The scoreboard is a memory of what has happened. The flow is a prophecy of what is to come.

Conventional sports analytics reads the box score. It is an autopsy of past events. The Pirouette Framework provides a more potent tool: a method for real-time diagnosis.

A sports match is a living systemâ€”a body in motion. Each team is a nested system striving for coherence against an adversary. By applying the principles of Flow Dynamics (DYN-001) and the diagnostic protocol of the Caduceus Lens (DYN-003), we can assess the health of each team in real-time. This is the art of reading the game's "prophecy" by observing which team is achieving and sustaining a state of Laminar Flow.
