The process begins with a "Cry for Help," a signal of dissonance from a system in distress. This signal is quantified by its core properties:
*   **Coherence (Kτ):** The integrity of the system's internal flows of information, resources, and trust. A problem signal indicates low Kτ.
*   **Temporal Pressure (Γ):** The sum of external and internal stresses acting upon the system. A problem signal indicates high Γ.

The engine then applies the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) to diagnose the specific pathology of flow. The symptoms are mapped to one of the three primary disruptions:
1.  **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnant Flow):** A critical flow is blocked. The "problem" is a lack of movement, a dam in the river.
2.  **Coherence Fever (Turbulent Flow):** The system is fighting itself. The "problem" is internal dissonance and wasted energy.
3.  **Coherence Erosion (Fraying Flow):** The system is losing its structural integrity and memory. The "problem" is decay.

This diagnostic act reframes the entire process. We are no longer "solving a problem" but "healing an ailment."
