1. **Pre-Act Parametric Gate (PBP+):**  
   - Thresholds on $T_a$, $\Gamma$, and Ki-rate set by context (domain, scale).  
   - **Admission Control:** Actions outside these gates are paused or require elevated review.  
2. **Act Execution & Wound Channel Mapping:**  
   - Real-time metrics record perturbations until parameters normalize.  
   - Map the boundary where Δ metrics return to baseline.  
3. **Post-Act Residual Audit & Ritual:**  
   - If residuals exceed **Gate Slack** (ΔThreshold margin), **invoke ritual**.  
   - Ritual validates Wound Channel data and issues sanctions or boundary adjustments.  
4. **Adaptive Feedback Loop:**  
   - Residual audits inform **gate recalibration**, tightening or loosening future thresholds.  
   - Ritual outcomes feed into **Registry CI**, updating hashes and invariants.
