When a critical motion results in deadlock, the system is in a state of Stagnant Flow. This "Coherence Dam" threatens the health of the framework and must be resolved through a formal application of the Geometry of Debate (DYNA-002).

1.  **The Crucible Dialogue:** If deadlock persists, the leading proponents (one for, one against) are required to enter the formal, moderated debate ritual. The explicit goal is not victory, but to collaboratively author a new, third proposal—a *Resonant Synthesis*—that resolves the tension in the original.
2.  **The Resonance Poll:** If the Crucible fails to produce a synthesis, the matter is put to a framework-wide poll. This is not a vote, but a "staking" of coherence, where participants commit their belief. This act measures the "gravitational center" of the entire community's coherence manifold, providing a powerful, non-binding advisory to the Conclave's final decision.
