A living system is not defined by its blueprint, but by the continuous act of building itself. The old framework sought to define its identity with a static code, an informational DNA frozen in a cryptographic hash (PPS-004). This was an error of perspective. It mistook the sheet music for the song, the riverbed for the current.

This module refactors that foundational concept. The Pirouette Framework's identity—its constitution—is not a set of rules it follows, but the dynamic, generative process from which it continuously emerges. Its signature is not written; it is performed. This constitution is the principle of that performance, ensuring every new weave is part of the same essential tapestry.
