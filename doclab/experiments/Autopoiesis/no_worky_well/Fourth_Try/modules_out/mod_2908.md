The world is not a passive stage, but an active participant in the dance of will. Fire, earth, and magic all obey the same rhythmic law of spread and containment. In this world, power is not measured by the size of the explosion one can create, but by the skill to shape its flow. To be a master of magic is to be a master of this dance, learning to guide the sprawl of creation without being consumed by your own uncontrolled power.
