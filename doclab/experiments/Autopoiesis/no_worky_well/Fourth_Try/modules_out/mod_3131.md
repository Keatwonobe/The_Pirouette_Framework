* The helical coordinate twist $\phi_s=\phi+\alpha z$ and its coupling to Maxwell already appear in the Prime Pirouette Series §4–§6, but without the explicit Berry-phase calculation .
* PPS-033 verbally asserts the 3-to-1 phase rule; the above furnishes the missing gauge-bundle proof.
* The extended Lagrangian’s spiral term $(\partial_{\phi}A_\mu)$ now gains an **a-posteriori coefficient** fixed by $K_i^{(0)}$, eliminating the free parameter flagged as numerology .
