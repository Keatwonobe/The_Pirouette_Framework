Understanding the Fork mechanism allows a Weaver to move from passive observer to active participant, gently influencing the flow of choice without violating the system's integrity.

| Stage | Objective | Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pre-Fork** | Clarify the choice | Use analytic tools to map the local coherence manifold, revealing the geometry and projected "cost" of the potential paths for the system. |
| **At the Fork** | Encourage a desired outcome | Apply a subtle, focused "nudge"—a gentle Γ-gradient or a focused Observer's Shadow (CORE-010)—to bias the selection process during the Collapse stage. |
| **Post-Fork** | Reinforce the choice | Introduce stabilizing elements that deepen the new Wound Channel, solidifying the commitment and preventing "buyer's remorse" or state-reversion. |
