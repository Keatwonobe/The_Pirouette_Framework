The Caduceus Lens reveals a profound truth: every system is a body. Every corporation, every ecosystem, every line of code, and every society has a physiology. It has currents that must flow, a form that must be maintained, and a health that can be cultivated.

To apply this lens is to move from the role of a mechanic, who replaces broken parts, to that of a physician, who understands that the whole is a living, breathing, and deeply interconnected conversation. The ultimate dare of the framework is met here: it provides the tools not just to analyze, but to heal.
