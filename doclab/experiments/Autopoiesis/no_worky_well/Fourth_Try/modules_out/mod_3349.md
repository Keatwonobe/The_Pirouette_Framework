This module documents the first successful detection of a Ki-resonant signature in a biological system. The experiment applied the principles of the Semantic Gravity Model (PPS-016) to a comprehensive database of protein sequences. The informational complexity of each protein was quantified by calculating its fractal dimension (D) via rate-distortion analysis. These dimensions were then normalized into a z-score distribution. The analysis revealed a statistically significant population of proteins whose informational complexity deviates from the norm by a factor of Ki. Crucially, a functional analysis of these Ki-resonant proteins shows they are overwhelmingly the most critical components of cellular machinery: the motors, regulators, and sentinels.
