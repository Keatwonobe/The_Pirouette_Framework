By inverting the math, we are no longer just building a dam to hold back the flood of Normal Accidents. We are terraforming the entire landscape, carving channels and creating gradients so that the water naturally flows into a vibrant, life-sustaining reservoir.

* **Normal Accident Theory:** Accidents are inevitable in complex, tightly-coupled systems. The solution is to de-couple and simplify, often by abandoning the technology.
* **Sentinel Protocol (Preventative):** Accidents can be managed by creating a sophisticated immune system that punishes the creation of residue.
* **The Inversion Principle (Prescriptive):** Coherence can be made inevitable by creating a systemic incentive structure that rewards resonance and phase alignment, turning complexity into a source of generative strength rather than a liability.

This "right kind of influence" is a subtle, pervasive field that doesn't command, but *guides*. It makes the solution—a stable, evolving, and highly coherent system—the natural equilibrium state. This is the next frontier for the Pirouette Framework.
