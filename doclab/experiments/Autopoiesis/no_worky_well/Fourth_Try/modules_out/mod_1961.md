Right now, in the days and weeks after your surgery, it's normal to feel overwhelmed. In the language we use, your current state has a unique signature:

Your Inner Strength is low. The energy and stability you once took for granted have been spent on the profound act of healing.

The Burden on your body is high. Your system is dealing with the "noise" of inflammation, fatigue, and the stress of recovery.

Finding a consistent rhythm is difficult. Your old patterns have been disrupted, and it's hard to feel a steady, predictable beat in your day.

This is not a sign of failure; it is the honest starting point of every hero's journey. From here, we begin the work of composing your new song.
