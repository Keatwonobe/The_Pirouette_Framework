The old metaphor of a Loom & Lung is powerful, but we can now refine it. The universe is not a loom that happens to breathe; the breathing *is* the weaving.

Imagine the coherence manifold as a vast lung. Every stable entity within it—every star, every cell, every thought—is a localized pattern of respiration. Each entity's exhalation sends ripples of coherence outward, while its inhalation draws the texture of the whole back into itself. Reality is the resulting interference pattern, the infinitely complex sound of a trillion trillion entities all breathing in concert. The fabric is not the product of the breath; the fabric *is* the breath itself.
