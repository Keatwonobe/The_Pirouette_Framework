The ratification of this module formally deprecates the prior derivation of Newton's G as the primary calibration for the framework's force scale. That approach, while insightful, was an attempt to measure the forge by observing the slow cooling of its largest castings. This new method measures the spark at the heart of the hammer's blow. Gravity is now understood as a macroscopic, emergent consequence of coherence and confinement (`CORE-008`), not the fundamental metronome for interaction strength.
