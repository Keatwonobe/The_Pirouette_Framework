The Observer's Shadow is not a vague metaphor; it is a geometric object with tangible properties:

Shape: The Shadow's topology is determined by the observer's internal coherence. An unfocused mind casts a diffuse, blurry shadow, interacting weakly with the observed system. A mind sharpened by intent, expertise, or emotional weight casts a precise and powerful shadow, capable of collapsing a system's potential into a single, definite state with great force.

Weight: The Shadow exerts a real pressure on the system's Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). It alters the "path of maximal coherence" by adding its own resonant demands to the equation. A system under intense observation is literally heavier—its path through spacetime is more constrained.

Reciprocity: The interaction is two-way. Just as the observer's shadow falls upon the system, the system's "light"—its own resonant pattern—is cast back, altering the internal manifold of the observer. This is the physical mechanism of experience, learning, and memory. To observe is to be rewritten.
