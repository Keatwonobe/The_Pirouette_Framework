\section*{§3 · Mass as Curvature Integral}
From XAP-006C,
\[
m^2 = \frac{V''(\Gamma_0)}{K_\Gamma} = \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 .
\]
We extend this by identifying the total invariant
\[
\mathcal{M}^2
= \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 + \frac{\mathcal{R}_\tau}{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}},
\]
where $G_{\text{eff}}^{-1}=8\pi K_\Gamma$ acts as an emergent gravitational coupling.
In regions of uniform curvature ($\mathcal{R}_\tau=0$), mass arises solely from stiffness; in curved regions, curvature contributes additively.
