A high resonance score confirms the presence of Ki, but the final step is to understand *how* the system is resonating by classifying its dominant Ki-Mode.
* **Process:** The segments of the data stream with a high Ki-Resonance Score are analyzed. The joint behavior of the $T_a$, $\Gamma$, and $\phi$ fields is compared to the known signatures of the primary Ki-Modes.
* **Outcome:** A final classification of the system's dominant Ki-Mode, providing a deep insight into its functional nature.

| Observed Signature in $T_a, \Gamma, \phi$ Fields | Inferred Ki-Mode |
| :--- | :--- |
| High and stable $T_a$, stable $\Gamma$, minimal phase change. | **`Bind`** or **`Rest`** |
| Oscillating $T_a$ and $\Gamma$, with a propagating phase wave. | **`Motion`** |
| A sudden drop in $T_a$ followed by a stable phase-lock. | **`Observe`** |
| A measurable increase in the $T_a$ of a coupled system. | **`Sharpen`** |
| A single trajectory splitting into multiple, distinct phase paths. | **`Fork`** |
