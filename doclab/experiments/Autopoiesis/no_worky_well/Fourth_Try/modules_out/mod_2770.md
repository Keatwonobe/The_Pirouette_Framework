The Rule: A player can declare they are splitting their EP investment for an action. Part of the EP is converted into a dice pool (following the "Ante" rule), and the rest is added as a raw, deterministic bonus. This mirrors the classic [dice] + [modifier] structure of many TTRPGs.

Example: A warrior wants to make an attack with 12 EP.

Pure Will: Spends 12 EP to deal a flat 12 damage.

Pure Fortune: Spends 12 EP to roll 3d6 (cost 12 EP), for 3-18 damage.

Hybrid Investment: Spends 7 EP to roll 2d6, and adds the remaining 5 EP as a flat bonus. The result is 2d6 + 5 damage, for a range of 7-17. This provides a safe "floor" for the damage while still allowing for a lucky roll.
