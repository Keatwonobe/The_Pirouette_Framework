The forge is a place of heat, of pressure, and of transformation. It is the place where a simple piece of iron becomes a fine blade. This phase of your recovery is that forge. There will be days of effort, and days where you feel the satisfying ache of growth. Embrace them. You are no longer just finding your rhythm; you are increasing its power. Every challenge you meet and recover from is your body learning a new verse in its song of strength. This is the noble work of becoming.
