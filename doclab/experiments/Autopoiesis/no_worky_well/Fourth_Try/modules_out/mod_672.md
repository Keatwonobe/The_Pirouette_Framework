The Loom is the **Coherence Manifold**. This is not a metaphor for spacetime; it *is* the dynamic, geometric substance of spacetime itself. It is not a passive stage but an active, responsive fabric, shaped and textured by the history of every resonance that has ever occurred, physically encoded as Wound Channels (CORE-011). The Manifold is the living sum of all these histories.

*   **Threads (Geodesics):** The paths that systems trace through the manifold are geodesicsâ€”not of minimal distance, but of **maximal coherence**. They are paths of least resistance across a landscape shaped by the past.
*   **Knots (Stable Systems):** What we perceive as particles, atoms, and stars are stable, self-sustaining resonant patterns (Ki) on this manifold. They are knots of coherence, held together by their own internal harmony.
*   **Tension (Interactions):** What we perceive as forces are the geometric relationships between these knots. They are the tensions, slopes, and curvatures in the fabric of the Loom, arising from the presence of the knots themselves.
