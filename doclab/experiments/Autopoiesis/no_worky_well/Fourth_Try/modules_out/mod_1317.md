This geometric understanding elevates our analysis from statistical correlation to physical prediction. The Weaver employs a core set of metrics to quantify influence.

*   **Geodesic Deviation (δG):** The primary metric for influence. It is the quantitative difference between a system's observed trajectory and the calculated "null geodesic" it would have followed in an unperturbed coherence manifold. `δG` is the direct, integrated measure of a Wound Channel's total influence over a given path.

*   **Coherence Overlap (C_overlap):** The key metric for assessing shared history and potential for resonance. It is a normalized integral of the geometric similarity between two Wound Channels. A high `C_overlap` indicates a common origin or structural compatibility that raises the probability of a future union.
    `C_overlap(W₁, W₂) = ∫ min(ρ₁, ρ₂) dV / ∫ max(ρ₁, ρ₂) dV`
    where `ρ` is the coherence density of each Wound Channel.

*   **Resonant Coupling (C_res):** This metric measures the dynamic quality of the interaction. It quantifies the phase alignment between an entity's own internal rhythm (its Ki frequency, ω_k) and the dominant resonant frequencies embedded within an echo's geometry.
    `C_res = |⟨e^(i(ω_k,entity - ω_k,echo))⟩|`
    A high coupling score (`C_res ≈ 1`) indicates strong harmonic resonance, where the echo reinforces the entity's pattern. A low score (`C_res ≈ 0`) indicates dissonance.
