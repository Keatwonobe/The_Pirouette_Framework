* **Order→Manifold**: (F: \text{Poset}_{\text{loc.fin.}} \to \text{Lorentz}), sending large random fabrics to emergent metrics via order-invariants.
* **Order→QFT** (Σ): pushforward along the correspondence gauge to vector bundles & connections: Ki↦complex section, holonomy↦U(1) connection, Γ↦scalar density.
* **Order→Homology**: order complex (\Rightarrow) simplicial homology for topological control.

These are the “ports” to known math.
