The output is not a simple "true" or "false" but a rich, multi-faceted diagnostic of the idea's nature.

-   **Coherence Cost (V_Γ):** This quantifies the "effort" or friction required to sustain the idea's pattern against the existing landscape. A profound truth often has a low cost, as it harmonizes with reality. A high-cost idea is one fundamentally at odds with the system's current state.

-   **Resonant Stability (K_τ):** This measures the idea's internal integrity and self-consistency. Its qualitative nature is described by its **Ki Topology**: a stable idea is a simple, harmonious braid, while an unstable one is a chaotic, tangled knot.

-   **Harmonic Potential:** This measures the idea's capacity for constructive interference—its ability to strengthen and clarify nearby concepts. A high potential indicates the idea may catalyze an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012), producing a net increase in the system's total coherence (a high *Coherence Gain*).
