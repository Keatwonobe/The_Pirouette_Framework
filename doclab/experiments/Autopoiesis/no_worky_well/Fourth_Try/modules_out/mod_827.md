This experiment is a direct and profound test of the framework's central equation. The path of a pulsar's signal through spacetime is the one that maximizes the action, `S_p`, which is the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006):

`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, where `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Here, `K_τ` represents the internal coherence of the signal, and `V_Γ` represents the "cost" imposed by the ambient Temporal Pressure. Our hypothesis is a modification to this potential term, making it explicitly time-dependent:

`V_Γ(t) = V_Γ₀ + f(δΓ cos(ω_c t))`

By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to this time-dependent Lagrangian, the resulting equation of motion for the signal explicitly predicts a periodic deviation in its trajectory. This deviation, when integrated over cosmological distances, produces precisely the timing residual sideband we seek to measure. A positive detection would be a direct measurement of the dynamic nature of the coherence manifold, confirming the core mechanics of the Lagrangian on a galactic scale.
