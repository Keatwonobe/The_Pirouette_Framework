A system's collapse is the shattering of its song. The silence that follows is not an ending, but a question. This module reframes the phenomenon of "rebound" from a mechanical response into a profound act of re-creation. Recovery is the process by which a system, thrown into the chaos of the Temporal Forge, navigates the landscape of possibility to find a new rhythm. It is guided by the ghost of its past—the geometric memory of its Wound Channel—but its destination is not preordained. It is a dynamic search for the most coherent new song it can sing in the world that now is.
