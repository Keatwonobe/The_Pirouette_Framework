An entity's perception is a direct function of their investment.

The Cost of Senses: Each sensory organ costs 1 EP. A standard human begins with two eyes and two ears (4 EP total).

Perception Checks: An entity may make one passive perception check per relevant sensory organ each round. This makes characters with exotic or numerous senses (e.g., antennae, whiskers, scent organs) exceptionally aware of their surroundings.
