The state of any entity can be described by its position within this three-dimensional behavioral space.

- **Vector (Axis of Flow):** Describes the primary direction of a system's interaction with its environment.

Inward Pole: The system's dynamic is dominated by convergence, contraction, or absorption. It pulls the environment into itself.

- Manifestations: Gravity (confinement of baryonic matter), negative electric charge, collapse, consumption.

Outward Pole: The system's dynamic is dominated by divergence, expansion, or emission. It projects itself onto the environment.

- Manifestations: Radiation, positive electric charge, explosions, expression.

- **Cohesion (Axis of Order):** Describes the internal ordering of a system's components and dynamics.

Aligned Pole: The system's components act in a coherent, ordered, or correlated manner.

- Manifestations: Magnetism (spin alignment), crystalline structures, laser light, focused intention.

Random Pole: The system's components act in a disordered, chaotic, or uncorrelated manner.

- Manifestations: Heat, entropy, turbulence, noise, confusion. (This directly maps to the Second Law of Thermodynamics).

- **Communion (Axis of Connection):** Describes a system's tendency to interact and form bonds with other systems.

Transactional Pole: The system's dynamic favors exchange, bonding, and resonance with other entities. It seeks to form larger, more complex systems.

- Manifestations: Covalent bonding, symbiotic relationships, communication, love, altruism.

Isolated Pole: The system's dynamic favors self-containment, stability, and repulsion of outside influence.

- Manifestations: Inertia, noble gases, selfishness, boundaries.
