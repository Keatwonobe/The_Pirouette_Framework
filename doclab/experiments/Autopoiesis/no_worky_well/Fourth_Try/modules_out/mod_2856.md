- Feat: Primary Thrall

Cost: 15 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You have learned the dark art of direct entropic infusion. You can target a corpse and begin to pour your own TEP into it. You must invest EP into its negative attributes to make them positive. This undead creature is sustained only by your will; at the start of each of your turns, you must spend at least 1 EP from your own TEP to maintain its animation. It does not impose an ERR cost, but it collapses into dust if you fail to sustain it.

- Feat: Ritual of Animation

Cost: 12 EP (Permanent TEP Sacrifice)

Effect: You can perform a 10-minute ritual to animate a corpse as a lesser undead thrall. You must then immediately engage it in a Tamer's Conversation to assert your will. If successful, you can form a Soul Bond with it, paying its full Entropy Budget from your TEP and the subsequent ERR cost to maintain it as a permanent minion.
