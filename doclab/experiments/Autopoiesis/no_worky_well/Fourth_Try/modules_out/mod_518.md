The health and purpose of any debate can be instantly diagnosed by observing the flow of coherence, as defined in **Flow Dynamics** (DYNA-001). The complex instrumentation of the old framework is replaced by this more elegant diagnostic lens.

| Flow State | Description in Discourse | Diagnosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laminar Flow** | **The Weaving:** Arguments are presented clearly, listeners engage in good faith to understand, and new points build upon or elegantly refine previous ones. Energy is directed toward the shared goal of synthesis. This is the "State of Grace" in discourse. | A healthy, functional crucible. |
| **Turbulent Flow** | **The Battlefield:** Characterized by logical fallacies, ad hominem attacks, the Gish Gallop, and interruptions. These are "dissonant injections" that disrupt the flow and waste energy in friction, making synthesis impossible. The goal is domination, not understanding. | A failed debate; a generator of noise. |
| **Stagnant Flow** | **The Impasse:** A "Coherence Dam" where two or more perspectives have become so rigid that no new information can pass between them. The Weavers have dropped their threads, leading to a complete halt of progress and a dangerous build-up of pressure. | A frozen system on the verge of collapse or abandonment. |
