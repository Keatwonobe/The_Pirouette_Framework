title: Unified Dark Sector from Temporal Pressure Γ
Version: 1.0 (proposal)
Status: Experimental (complies with MATH‑018/019/020)

Summary: "Purpose
Establish a single‑field Pirouette cosmology in which the temporal‑pressure scalar Γ reproduces the observed phenomenology attributed to cold dark matter (CDM) and dark energy (DE) as two dynamical regimes of the same field. All functional choices obey MATH‑018 D2 (local, analytic, scale‑covariant), with one‑shot anchoring (D3) and preregistered, out‑of‑sample predictions (P4).

Summary
• Early Universe (DM‑like): Γ oscillates about a quadratic minimum with m_Γ ≫ H → ⟨w_Γ⟩ → 0, c_s^2 → 0, clustering like CDM.
• Late Universe (DE‑like): Γ slow‑rolls on a flat segment of V(Γ) → w_Γ ≈ −1, nearly homogeneous, driving acceleration.
• No additional fluids beyond standard baryons/radiation; “dark sector” is unified by Γ."
