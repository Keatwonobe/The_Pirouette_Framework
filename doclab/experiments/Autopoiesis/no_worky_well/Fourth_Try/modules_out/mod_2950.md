The bottom realm is a sandbox of possibilities. While the immediate goal is survival, the world is rich with deeper mysteries and grander objectives. The GM should subtly weave hints of these eight major paths into the campaign, allowing the players to choose their own destiny. A party may pursue one, several, or even all of these goals over the course of their journey.

The Enigma of Heresy: Uncover the true identity of the being known as Heresy. This path involves piecing together scattered journal entries, deciphering ancient Skazan lore, and confronting the tragic history of the fallen empire.

The Path of Return: Discover a way to reverse the Skazan's translocation ritual, escape the bottom realm, and break the curse of forgetfulness placed upon your loved ones. This is a quest for personal redemption and a return to a life that was stolen.

The Unseen War: Take the fight to the Skazan Order. This path is a shadow war of infiltration, counter-espionage, and assassination, where players must identify and eliminate the Skazan's secret agents embedded within the realm's factions before they can be "harvested."

Forging a New Home: Abandon the idea of escape and carve out a new life. This path is about building something permanent in the wastes—founding a new village, taking control of a walking city, and becoming a power in your own right.

The Unification: Bring an end to the endless conflicts between the walking cities. This is a grand-scale political and military campaign of diplomacy, sabotage, and alliance-building, with the goal of uniting the disparate factions against a common foe.

The Heresies' Peace: The minor Heresies are eternally hunted by the great Heresy. Discover a way to shield them from their pursuer. Success could be rewarded with passage to any other plane of existence or even the chance to transcend your mortal form.

The Endless Horizon: The world is vast and filled with forgotten wonders and horrors. This path is for the pure explorer—the treasure hunter who wishes to chart the unknown, from the frozen hulks in the fields of wildflowers to the wrecked Skazan ships in the mountains.

The Greater Cosmos: The bottom realm is but one battlefield in a larger cosmic war. This path involves leaving the starting plane to engage with the Skazan Empire on its own turf, navigating interstellar politics, and taking the fight to a truly galactic scale.
