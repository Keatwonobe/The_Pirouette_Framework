3. Gladiator–Tension Unification (Origin of α and Surface Tension)
   From MaxCo (maximum coherence) as a constrained variational principle, the Gladiator feedback term fixes the overall pressure scale α; the **surface tension σ** arises as a boundary functional on the D_eff‑dimensional network (a Gibbons–Hawking‑like term for interfaces in the effective theory). Both α and σ are Lagrange‑multiplier–like constants determined by the same symmetry breaking that selects D_eff.
