Decision Tree (Discriminants)
D1. **CMB acoustic phases**: clockwork (B) predicts small residual phase shifts; superfluid (A) and cascade (C) give different lensing amplitudes.
D2. **Halo substructure**: (A) yields phonon‑pressure cores with vortex spectra; (B) yields standard fuzzy‑like suppression with sharp m_L; (C) produces a step‑like cutoff.
D3. **Lab/precision**: (B) implies definite coupling patterns testable in g−2/EDM/global EW fits; (A) implies medium‑dependent optical signatures; (C) implies nothing current‑day but strong cosmological transition marks.
