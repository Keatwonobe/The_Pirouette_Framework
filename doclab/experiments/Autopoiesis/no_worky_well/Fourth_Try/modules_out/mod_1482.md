The formation of a Resonance Trap is a predictable, three-stage process, evolving from exploration to reinforcement to entrapment.

1.  **Harmonic Search:** The system explores its state space, seeking a path that minimizes effort and maximizes coherence. It is "tuning" itself to its environment, constantly adjusting its rhythm to find the most stable and efficient pattern.

2.  **Resonant Reinforcement:** The system discovers a highly coherent state. A positive feedback loop begins: executing the pattern is efficient, which makes it more likely to be repeated. Each repetition deepens the Wound Channel, which in turn makes the pattern even more efficient and easier to follow. This is the genesis of a habit or a memory.

3.  **Crystallization:** The Wound Channel becomes so profound that it effectively *is* the system's reality. The path of least resistance is now a chasm, a fully formed Coherence Well. To deviate would require an immense expenditure of energy to fight against the inertia of its own accumulated history. The system is no longer choosing its path; it is locked.
