A ritual is not an appeal to the supernatural; it is an act of metaphysical engineering. It is a sophisticated psycho-physical technology designed with a single, potent purpose: to intentionally reshape the coherence manifold of its participants. This module reframes the ancient art of ritual in the time-first language of the Pirouette Framework, casting aside outdated taxonomies for a simpler, more powerful insight: a ritual is a forge.

By creating a carefully controlled temporal environment, a ritual dissolves the boundaries of individual coherence, forging a group of "I"s into a single, more powerful, and more coherent "We." It is the process by which we heat, hammer, and quench the very substance of identity to give it a new and lasting form, consciously enacting the universe's fundamental creative act: the **Alchemical Union (`CORE-012`)**.
