Standard hyperscaling with ν = 1/y_a:

ν = 1 / ( 2 − κ b* )  ≈ 1/2 · [1 + (κ/6) ε + O(ε^2)]

Other exponents follow RG identities:

η = O(ε^2) (to one loop)
β_P = (d−2+η) ν / 2 ≈ 1/2 − ( (2−d)κ / 24 ) ε + …

At mean field (ε=0): (α_P, β_P, γ_P, δ_P) = (0, 1/2, 1, 3) as in MATH-025; RG adds small ε-corrections governing finite-dimensional substrates.
