This is not a curse but a symbiotic, parasitic pact, closer to a Warlock's bond than a simple affliction.

The Pact: The "victim" (the Host) forges a pact with a powerful entity (the Patron). The Host gains access to a significant pool of raw power or some other boon. In return, the Patron can use the Host as a remote conduit for their own will.

Reallocation Mandate: The Host suffers a permanent, massive reduction in their invested Wisdom and Intelligence EP. This EP is not reallocated elsewhere; it is held in a special "Pact Pool."

Mechanics of Control: The Host has no control over the Pact Pool. The Patron (controlled by the GM) can cast spells or use abilities through the Host, drawing the EP cost from the Pact Pool. The Host is merely a vessel for the Patron's actions, which are often cruel and targeted at those the Host cares about to maximize their suffering and "flavor" the energy they provide.
