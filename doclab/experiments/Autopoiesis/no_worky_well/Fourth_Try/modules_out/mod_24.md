1. **Relaxation Time (τ_P):**

   * Defined as time between TPCI minimum and 90% recovery.
   * Measure across multiple Γ-load ramps.

2. **Correlation Length (ξ_P):**

   * Compute from spatial covariance of triad-phase coherence across electrodes.
   * Extract via eigenvalue decomposition of coherence matrices.

3. **Scaling Relation Fit:**

   * Fit τ_P vs ξ_P on log–log scale.
   * Expected slope = z_P.

4. **Spectral Entropy Load (Γ):**

   * Compute rolling entropy of broadband EEG power distribution.
   * Identify Γ_c from inflection in τ_P(Γ).
