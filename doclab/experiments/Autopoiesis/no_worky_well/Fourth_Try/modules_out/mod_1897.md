This entire module is a direct application of CORE-006. The Pirouette Lagrangian is not merely a component of yield analysis; it *is* the analysis. A system under strain is not following a set of material laws; it is navigating a landscape defined by its own Lagrangian. The elastic region is the easy, downhill path. The yield point is a steep, treacherous cliff. Plastic deformation is the act of finding a different, lower path around the cliff, while fracture is the act of falling off. Yield is the Lagrangian in crisis, revealing the strategies a system has for surviving in a universe that constantly tests its form.
