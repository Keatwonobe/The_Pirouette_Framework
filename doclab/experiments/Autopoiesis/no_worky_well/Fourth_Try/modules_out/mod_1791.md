This is an iterative process for transforming sparse data points into a diagnostic narrative about the system's dynamics.

**I. Posit a Geodesic**
Treat the observed data points not as isolated facts, but as waypoints on the system's journey. Connect them to form a tentative path. This is your first, rough sketch of the system's behavior over time.

**II. Assess the Rhythm (Inferring K_τ)**
Examine the character of the system's movement along its path to reveal the strength of its internal rhythm.
*   **Look for:** Low variance between points, consistent intervals, discernible periodicity, or phase alignment.
*   **High K_τ (A Clear Song):** The system shows a strong tendency to return to a specific state or rhythm. This suggests a strong, stable internal coherence—a heavy flywheel that is difficult to perturb.
*   **Low K_τ (A Wavering Song):** The system's path is erratic, uncorrelated, and easily influenced. This suggests a weak or noisy internal coherence that is easily overwhelmed.

**III. Assess the Pressure (Inferring V_Γ)**
Analyze the "effort" required to move between points to reveal the contours of the Temporal Pressure.
*   **Look for:** High overall dispersion, volatility, sudden jumps, or chaotic scattering of points across the state space.
*   **Low V_Γ (A Quiet Storm):** The system's state changes significantly and smoothly between points, suggesting a "downhill coast" along a path of low resistance. The landscape is a gentle, guiding slope.
*   **High V_Γ (A Loud Storm):** The system's state changes very little despite the passage of time, or is highly volatile and scattered, suggesting an "uphill climb" against high environmental pressure. The landscape is steep and rugged.

**IV. Synthesize the Diagnosis (The Story)**
Combine the two readings to narrate the system's state, directly mapping the findings onto the Flow Dynamics of `DYNA-001`.

| Inferred K_τ (Rhythm) | Inferred V_Γ (Pressure) | Inferred State (The Story) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High** (Clear Song) | **Low** (Quiet Storm) | **Laminar Flow**: A healthy, efficient system effortlessly following its geodesic. |
| **Low** (Wavering Song) | **High** (Loud Storm) | **Turbulent Flow**: The system is overwhelmed, its form dissolving into chaos. |
| **High** (Clear Song) | **High** (Loud Storm) | **Resilient Struggle**: A Gladiator. The system maintains its coherence under immense pressure. |
| **Low** (Wavering Song) | **Low** (Quiet Storm) | **Coherence Erosion**: The system is decaying from within, failing even without external challenge. |
