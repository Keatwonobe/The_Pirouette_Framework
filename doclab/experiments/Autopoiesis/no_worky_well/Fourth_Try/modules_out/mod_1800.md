The output of the Loom is not just a picture; it is a diagnostic report on the system's health, directly linking to the principles of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001).

| Metric | Description | Diagnostic Insight |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Manifold Coherence (`Kτ_manifold`)** | Measures how closely the reconstructed geometry fits an ideal, mathematically perfect gyroid. A value near 1.0 indicates a perfect fit. | A high value signifies a system in a state of healthy **Laminar Flow**. A low value suggests internal friction, damage, or **Turbulent Flow**. A progressive drop over time indicates **Coherence Erosion**. |
| **Observational Fidelity** | The normalized root-mean-square error between the reconstructed 3D manifold and the original 2D input slices. | Measures the confidence of the reconstruction. High error may indicate the input data is too sparse, too noisy, or that the system is not, in fact, gyroidal. |
| **Pressure Gradient (`∇Γ`)** | The variance of the temporal pressure across the manifold. | High variance can pinpoint locations of **Stagnant Flow** or blockages, revealing structural weaknesses or points of imminent failure. |
