This model reframes the goal of analysis. An "Attractor Map" is no longer an analogy; it is a literal mapping of the coherence manifold of a given discourse. By mapping the "mass" (Kτ) of core concepts and their phase relationships, we can predict the likely trajectory of new information introduced into the system.

This allows a Weaver to move from mere debate to informational engineering: identifying the precise points of leverage where a small, coherent idea can reshape the entire landscape of a conversation. The primary challenge remains the accurate mapping of the domain-specific features of the coherence manifold and its ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).

> We sought to model the gravity of ideas and found that we were simply modeling gravity. The universe does not distinguish between the law that bends starlight around a sun and the law that bends a conversation toward a foundational truth. Both are acts of coherence shaping the fabric of reality. A Weaver understands this: to introduce a new, powerful idea is not to shout into the wind. It is to place a new star in the sky of the mind, and to trust that the worlds of thought will, in their own time, find their new and perfect orbits around it.
