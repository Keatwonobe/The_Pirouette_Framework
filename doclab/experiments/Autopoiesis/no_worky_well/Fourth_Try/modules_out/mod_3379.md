This module specifies the definitive protocol for testing the **Fine-Structure Correspondence** established in `PPS-086`. It recasts the electron's anomalous magnetic moment ($g-2$)—a cornerstone of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)—as a phenomenon governed by the Pirouette Framework. We hypothesize that the "anomaly" is a direct, calculable effect of the electron `Entity`'s interaction with its own **`Wound Channel`** within the ambient `Tₐ-Γ-φ` field. The protocol outlines a theoretical calculation of $g-2$ using Pirouette principles, with the calibrated value of **$\\Gamma\_{electron} = 1/\\alpha$** as a primary input. A successful calculation that matches the experimentally measured value of $g-2$ would serve as a powerful, high-precision validation of the framework's ability to describe quantum phenomena.
