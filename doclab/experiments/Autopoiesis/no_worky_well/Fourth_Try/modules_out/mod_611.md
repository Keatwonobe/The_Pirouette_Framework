summary: Explains 'Crystallization,' the phase transition of a system's dynamic history
  (Wound Channel) into a static Information Lattice. Defines the 'Lock,' a state of
  catastrophic stability driven by extreme coherence, which forms the physical basis
  for memory, habit, and dogma by sacrificing adaptability for perfect persistence.
