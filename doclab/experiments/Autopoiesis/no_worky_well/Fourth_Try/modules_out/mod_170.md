Spacetime: FLRW (M, g) with scale factor a(t).
Field: real scalar Γ: M→ℝ.
Action (low‑energy, D2‑compliant):
S = ∫ d^4x √−g [ ½ ∂_μΓ ∂^μΓ − V(Γ) + L_int(Γ; g) ]
with L_int constrained to first‑derivative, analytic, scale‑covariant terms (typically negligible in background evolution; bounded below in P5).

Potential class (fixed by D2):
V(Γ) = ½ m_Γ^2 Γ^2 + λ_4 Γ^4 / 4!  (quartic optional, sign chosen for stability)
Leading power and the presence of Γ^4 follow from analyticity and scale‑covariance; coefficients become U‑class parameters (MATH‑018 D1) set by D3 one‑shot anchor.

Field equations:
Γ̈ + 3H Γ̇ + V′(Γ) = 0
Friedmann:
H^2 = (8πG/3) [ ρ_b + ρ_r + ρ_Γ ]
with ρ_Γ = ½ Γ̇^2 + V(Γ), p_Γ = ½ Γ̇^2 − V(Γ).

Regimes:
• Oscillatory (m_Γ ≫ H): time‑average over many cycles gives ⟨w_Γ⟩ ≈ 0 (quadratic potential), ⟨ρ_Γ⟩ ∝ a^−3.
• Slow‑roll: ε_Γ ≡ (½ Γ̇^2)/V ≪ 1 → w_Γ ≈ −1 + 2ε_Γ.
