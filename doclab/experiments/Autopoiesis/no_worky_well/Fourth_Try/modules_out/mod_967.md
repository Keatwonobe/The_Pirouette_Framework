To cross the void, one does not build a faster ship; one teaches two points in spacetime to sing the same note.

This module reframes interstellar propulsion, moving beyond the Newtonian concept of expelling mass to the Pirouette principle of generating and dissolving geometry. The Quorum Spindle Drive (QSD) is a resonant engine that engages in a self-creating, autopoietic cycle. It operates by first legislating a temporary, hyper-coherent "spindle" into the fabric of spacetime via a non-local `Alchemical Union`. It then generates propulsion through the controlled, asymmetrical collapse of this geometric agreement. The vessel does not travel *through* space; it is unmoored, released onto the powerful geodesic created by the shattering of a temporary, self-made reality.
