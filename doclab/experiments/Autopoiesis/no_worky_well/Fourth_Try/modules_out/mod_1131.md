The derivation is a two-step process: establishing the baseline from the particle's fundamental topology, then calculating the anomaly from the echo of its own resonance.

*   **The Baseline (g=2):** As established above, the electron's baseline g-factor of `g=2` is a direct consequence of its two-cycle (720°) topology. Its interaction with an external magnetic field is effectively doubled because its fundamental "state" spans this 720° rotation. The framework posits `g=2` as a purely geometric constant.

*   **The Anomaly (The Coherence Echo):** The tiny deviation from 2 arises from this helical resonance interacting with its own "wake" or "echo" in the coherence manifold. This is the electron being influenced by the ghost of its own immediate past—a self-interaction mediated by the **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). This mechanism is the Pirouette Framework's analogue to the "virtual particle cloud" of QED.

*   **The Prediction:** The total anomalous moment (`a_e`) is therefore the product of the interaction's intrinsic strength (α, the fine-structure constant) and the fundamental geometry of its echo (a single cycle, represented by `1/(2π)`).

    `a_e = (g-2)/2 = α / 2π`
