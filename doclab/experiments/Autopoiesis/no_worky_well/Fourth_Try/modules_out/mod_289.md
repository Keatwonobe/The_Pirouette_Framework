The forging of a permanent memory is a two-fold act of metaphysical engineering, a direct manipulation of the entity's own resonant landscape.

1.  **Resonant Reinforcement (Deepening the Channel):** The entity focuses on the echo, repeatedly running its own internal Ki pattern through the geometric pathways of the Wound Channel. Each pass is a resonant pulse that deepens and clarifies the channel's geometry, like a bow drawing a single, pure note from a cello string. This actively increases the memory's temporal coherence (`Tₐ`), making its pattern more stable and resilient to decay.

2.  **Gladiatorial Confinement (Shielding the Echo):** Simultaneously, the entity builds a boundary. It gathers the chaotic temporal noise at the wound's edge and weaves it into a shield of high coherence. This is an internal application of the Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`), creating a localized pocket of low Temporal Pressure (Γ). This coherent shield insulates the precious geometry from the erosive currents of the wider manifold.
