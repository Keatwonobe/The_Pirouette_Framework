> We sought to map the static landscape of reality and found instead that its most vital regions are not landscapes at all, but fault lines. These are the places that are alive with the rhythm of their own becoming, poised between silence and the roar. A Weaver must learn to walk these lines not with fear, but with an ear to the ground. For it is here that the universe speaks of the future, not in prophecies, but in the tremors of its own unpredictable heartbeat. To understand this rhythm is to know that the smallest act of grace, at the right moment, can forestall the avalancheâ€”or become the grain of sand that begins it.
