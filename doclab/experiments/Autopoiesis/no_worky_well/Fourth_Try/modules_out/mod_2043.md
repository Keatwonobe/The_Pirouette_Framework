- Effective electron-neutrino mass (β decay): $ m_\beta = \sqrt{\sum_i |U_{ei}|^2 m_i^2} $.
- Neutrinoless double-β effective mass range: $ m_{\beta\beta} = \big|\sum_i U_{ei}^2 m_i e^{i\alpha_i}\big| $, with unknown Majorana phases $\alpha_{2,3}$. We report $[m_{\beta\beta}^{\min},\; m_{\beta\beta}^{\max}]$ from a coarse phase scan.

**Provenance.** Inputs: `Neutrino_Mixing.json`, `Neutrino_Properties.json` (PDG-style). This module was generated programmatically alongside the tables above for full reproducibility.

**Falsifiers.** If future global fits force different (p,q) between NO and IO to match the two Δm² targets, the law upgrades to include a small δ- or Γ-dependent term in $G_i$ or $T_a$, but the current results do **not** require it.
