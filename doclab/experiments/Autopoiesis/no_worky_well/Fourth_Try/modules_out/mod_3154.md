Re-install the platter coil.  Without touching anything else:

* Count the *static* fringe displacement in radians:

  $$
  \Delta\phi_{\text{meas}} = 2\pi \times
      \Bigl(\tfrac{\text{fringe shift fraction}}{1}\Bigr).
  $$

  A quarter-fringe shift = $0.5π$ rad, half-fringe = $π$ rad, etc.
* Divide by the mm-per-fringe calibration to make sure any extra optical-path-length error is < 10 % of the theoretical phase (they add algebraically but you can bound them).
