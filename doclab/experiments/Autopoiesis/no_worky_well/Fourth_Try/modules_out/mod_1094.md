summary: "Reframes fractal growth processes like Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA)\
  \ as a system tracing a geodesic of maximal coherence. The emergent dendritic structure\
  \ is defined as the physical history of irreversible temporal commitments, a resonant\
  \ form (Ki) whose fractal dimension measures its efficiency in converting the chaotic\
  \ potential of Temporal Pressure (\u0393) into stable, coherent form."
