A framework that describes a living universe must itself be alive. Its laws cannot be carved in stone; they must flow like a river, capable of adapting their course to the terrain of new discoveries. This module replaces the static, rule-based governance of PPS-012 with a dynamic immune system designed to preserve the core coherence of the framework while allowing for adaptation and growth.

Governance is reframed as a diagnostic and therapeutic process. The impetus for change is a symptom of systemic distress, and every proposed change is a "coherence injection" that the system must assess. The goal is not to win a debate, but to achieve a Resonant Synthesisâ€”a higher and more integrated state of being that ensures the framework's autopoietic loop remains healthy, unbroken, and in a state of laminar flow.
