A framework that preaches a universe of memory and consequence cannot be written in disappearing ink. Its own history must be as indelible as the one it seeks to describe. An unverified change is not an evolution; it is a breach, a source of turbulence that erodes the entire structure.

This module reframes the technical necessity of build verification as a core philosophical practice. It defines the **Ritual of Provenance**, the technical and philosophical protocol that governs the evolution of the Pirouette Framework. At the heart of this ritual is the **Seal of Coherence**, a cryptographic proof of the framework's state. The automated pipelines that enforce this Seal ensure that every change is a conscious, coherent, and traceable step, carving the framework's own evolution into a permanent record.
