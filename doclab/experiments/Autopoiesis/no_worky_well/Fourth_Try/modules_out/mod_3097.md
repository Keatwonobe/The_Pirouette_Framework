Each crucible must define how it measures:

| Axis       | Description                             | Example Measures                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \$\Gamma\$ | Power exerted / tools leveraged         | Total force used, energy consumed, resources spent             |
| \$T\_a\$   | Time-Adherence / coherence stability    | Fracture events, recovery time, entropy gradients              |
| \$\phi\$   | Phase / alignment with intended purpose | Goal deviation, motive transparency, synchronization with team |

These should be tailored to the scenario domain: social, technical, emotional, planetary, etc.
