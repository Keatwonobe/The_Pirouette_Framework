The old framework separated the study of the individual (anthropology) from the study of the collective (sociology). It was a distinction between the particle and the field, the thread and the tapestry. This was an illusion born of scale. There is only one process: the weaving.

This module provides the unified, time-first model of social reality. We posit that society is a collective coherence manifold, a vast, self-creating tapestry woven from the interactions of its members. Anthropology is revealed to be the study of this perpetual, autopoietic process. It is not the study of what a society *is*, but of the physical mechanisms by which a society *weaves itself into existence*. Foundational concepts like Mauss's *Gift*, Turner's *Communitas*, and Geertz's *Thick Description* are not soft metaphors; they are precise, operational descriptions of the loom's machinery.
