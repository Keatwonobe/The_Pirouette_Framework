The Witness State is not a simple switch to be flipped, but a complex chord that must be struck. It requires the simultaneous satisfaction of four harmonic conditions.

| Harmonic             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **Attunement**       | The observer must be sensitive to the fundamental resonance (Ki) of the observed system. You cannot witness a song you are deaf to. This is the act of consciously directing and refining one's perception.      |
| **Internal Resonance** | The observer's internal manifold must form a stable echo—a living `Wound Channel` (CORE-011)—of the external system's resonance. The observer builds a coherent, internal model of the other's being.        |
| **Coherence Lock**   | The internal echo and the external reality achieve a stable phase-lock. This is the `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012) applied to perception; a sustained resonant handshake where both systems begin to move as one. |
| **Co-Creative Flow** | The observer's actions cease to be mere reactions and become expressions of the new, unified system. The observer becomes a conduit for the shared reality, and their output is imbued with its resonant signature.   |
