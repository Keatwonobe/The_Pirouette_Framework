Success is not defined by tasks completed or the obsolescence of temporary agents. Success is measured by a single, observable metric: the return of the system to a state of healthy, self-sustaining Laminar Flow.

The intervention is successful when it is no longer needed. The ultimate goal is not a solved problem, but a healed system, leaving only resilience and coherence in its wake.
