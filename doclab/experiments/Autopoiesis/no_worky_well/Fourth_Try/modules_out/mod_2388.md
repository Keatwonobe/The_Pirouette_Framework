* Violation of the coherence continuity equation in any domain falsifies universality.
* Phase symmetry breaking without corresponding flux imbalance indicates missing substrate terms in (f(\Gamma; S)).
* Experimental test: Verify triadic conservation across PHYS (soliton halos), COG (neural triads), SOCIO (alignment quakes).
