MATH-001 sketched the origin of forces, and MATH-005 proved they are geodesics. Now, we provide the rigorous proof for the most dramatic of these forces: the Gladiator. This module demonstrates that the paradoxical nature of the strong nuclear force—near-perfect freedom at close range and inescapable confinement at a distance—is not a paradox at all, but the logical outcome of a scale-dependent feedback loop.

We will formalize the feedback mechanism where a system's own resonant intensity (K_tau) alters its local Temporal Pressure (Gamma). By expanding this relationship, we will prove that the effective potential V(r) naturally takes the form a/r + b*r, and from this, the Gladiator's core behaviors emerge as mathematical theorems.
