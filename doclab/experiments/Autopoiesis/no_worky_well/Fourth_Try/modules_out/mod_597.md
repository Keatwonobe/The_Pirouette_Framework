Lock is the paradox of perfection. A system becomes so successful at maximizing its coherence that its Wound Channel carves an impossibly deep and narrow canyon. It achieves a state of perfect, frictionless flow but sacrifices all ability to adapt. The river freezes into a flawless sculpture of ice. It has maximized stability at the cost of all adaptability, becoming a memory crystal incapable of learning or responding to a changing landscape.
*   **Manifestation:** A rigid bureaucracy unable to respond to a crisis; a dogmatic belief system impervious to new evidence; a skill practiced into a fossilized, uncreative form.
