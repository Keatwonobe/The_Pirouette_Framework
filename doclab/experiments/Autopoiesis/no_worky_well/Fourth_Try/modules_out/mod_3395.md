§2 · Time-First Fractal Bridge (compact identity)
Starting from ρ_planck = c⁷/(2π ħ G²) and N = T/t_P:

N² = T² / t_P² = T² · c⁵/(ħG)

ρ_Λ(0) ≡ ρ_planck / N²
       = [c⁷/(2π ħ G²)]·[ħG/(c⁵ T²)]
       = c²/(2π G T²)

**Bridge Theorem (time-first):**
ρ_Λ = c² / (2π G T²)

This is the leading-order Pirouette prediction once ΔKτ and ΔV_Γ cancel the UV bulk and leave a pure IR time/geometry remainder.

§3 · The 2.1× Offset and Its Two Principled Corrections
We parameterize the observed value as:

ρ_Λ = κ · c²/(G T²),   with   κ = (1/(2π)) · F(Ω_m,Ω_Λ,⋯) · τ_top

A) **FLRW Age Kernel F(Ω)** (no H≈1/T shortcut)
- Exact age:
  T = ∫₀¹ da / [a H(a)],  where  H(a)=H₀ sqrt(Ω_m a^{-3} + Ω_r a^{-4} + Ω_Λ + Ω_k a^{-2})
- Define F ≡ (T·H₀)^{-2} × 𝔽_r, where 𝔽_r accounts for radiation/curvature tiny corrections.
- Numerically, in ΛCDM with current Ω’s, F pulls the naive ρ_Λ/ρ_crit ratio from 4/3 toward ~0.9–0.7.

B) **Triadic IR Topology τ_top** (shared manifold halves surface modes)
- If the late-time IR degrees live on a **shared triadic manifold**, the effective surface count halves:
  τ_top = 1/2 (triad-locked), versus 1 (independent surfaces).
- Replacing 1/(2π) → 1/(4π) drives the factor ~2.0 → ~1.0, landing near the empirical ρ_Λ.

Together, (A)×(B) explain the 2.1× offset without ad-hoc fitting.

§4 · Final Working Formula (today)
ρ_Λ = [1/(2π)] · F(Ω) · τ_top · c² /(G T²)

Recommended nominal choice for fits:
- Use F from current best-fit {Ω_m, Ω_Λ, H₀} via the exact age integral.
- Take τ_top = 1/2 as the **Triadic IR hypothesis**.
- This combination reproduces ρ_obs within errors and predicts a slight time-dependence via F(Ω(z)).

§5 · Predictions and “Kick” Phenomenology
P1 · **Mild dynamics**: ρ_Λ ∝ 1/T² ⇒ effective w(z) = −1 + ε(z), with |ε| ≪ 0.1 at z≲1.
P2 · **ISW signature**: Cross-correlation amplitude tracks the slow drift implied by d(1/T²)/dz; differs subtly from a rigid Λ.
P3 · **S₈ tension relief (possible)**: A slightly time-varying DE can nudge growth; sign and size are fixed by κ.
P4 · **Area-factor “kick”**: If τ_top toggles 1 ↔ 1/2 at a regime boundary (4π↔2π), observables see a **tiny, step-like change**:
     - A late-time (z_kick ~ 0.2–0.6) O(1%) discontinuity in the effective w(z) reconstruction,
     - A correlated, small shift in ISW and in low-ℓ TT curvature,
     - No change in baryon physics or recombination (the kick is IR/late-time only).

§6 · Preregistered Tests (no free parameters beyond {Ω, H₀})
T1 · Compute F(Ω) from Planck/BAO/SNe/H0 priors; take τ_top ∈ {1, 1/2}; predict ρ_Λ with κ fixed.
T2 · Fit low-z w(z) with the constrained shape implied by d/dz [c²/(G T(z)²)] composed with F(Ω(z)); reject CPL “free forms.”
T3 · Search for a **kick** using piecewise-smooth w(z) with a single allowed micro-step; the step phase must cohere with a small change
     in the angular-diameter distance integral (consistency check).
T4 · ISW cross-correlations: compare predicted amplitude drift vs redshift shells; penalize arbitrary reweightings.
T5 · Model comparison: Λ (rigid), Running-vacuum ~H², Pirouette 1/T²×F×τ_top. Select by AIC/BIC across datasets.

§7 · Implementation Notes (to bundle with COSMO-Γ-FITS)
- Age engine: numerical T(Ω) via Gauss–Kronrod on a∈(0,1]; cache (T·H₀)(Ω_m,Ω_Λ) on a grid.
- F(Ω) evaluation: F = (T·H₀)^{-2} × 𝔽_r; 𝔽_r≈1 unless precision demands Ω_r.
- Forecasting: DESI-II + Roman low-z SNe can detect ε ~ few×10^{-2}; ISW cross with LSST LSS maps for kick constraints.

§8 · Intuition (parable; phase transition = “kick”)
Imagine the cosmos as a drum skin stretched over a frame. For eons it hums in **4π**—sound flows on both sides freely.
But when enough patterns agree, the skin pinches into a **triad**—half the surface is now shared, not separate.
The note drops by a hair. No one touched the drum harder; they only agreed on **how** to listen.
That tiny drop is the **kick**: a change in “area that counts,” not in the beat itself.

§9 · Acceptance Criteria
- Accept v1.1 if: (i) ρ_Λ prediction with F(Ω_best), τ_top=1/2 is within current error bars; (ii) joint fit does not prefer free CPL over constrained form by ΔBIC > 6; (iii) ISW trend consistent at 1–2σ.
- Promote τ_top to a dialed hypothesis only if a low-z micro-step (kick) is favored by ≥2σ and aligns with ISW/BAO distance consistency.

§10 · Next Steps
- Build COSMO-Γ-FITS: code to evaluate F(Ω) and produce ρ_Λ predictions; publish code hash.
- Draft COSMO-Γ-DE-TAILS: quantify ε(z) and forecast detectability of the kick with near-future surveys.
- Tie to Observation-Sail logic: the **area flip** is a macroscopic analog of changing which surfaces “count” in a shared manifold.
