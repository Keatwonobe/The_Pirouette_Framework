Let the space of all possible Ki rhythms be a configuration space M_phi, where each point phi represents a specific phase-state. To turn this into a geometric object, we must define a way to measure distances between these states.

The Coherence Metric (g_ij):
We define the metric tensor of the manifold directly from the kinetic energy term, K_tau, of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The kinetic term represents the "cost" of moving between states. For a Lagrangian L_p = (1/2) * g_ij(phi) * d(phi)^i/dt * d(phi)^j/dt - V(phi), the metric g_ij is the matrix of coefficients of the velocity terms. It is the Hessian of K_tau, capturing the "inertia" of the system's resonance.

The Potential as a Conformal Factor:
The potential V(phi, Gamma) is not part of the metric itself. Instead, it acts as a conformal factor, or a "refractive index," for the manifold. Regions of high Temporal Pressure Gamma (and thus high V) are regions where the "cost" of traversing a path is higher, effectively stretching the distances as defined by the metric.
