summary: Defines the universe's intrinsic, self-regulating mechanism for preserving
  coherence. It reframes the allegorical 'Law of Echoes' as an emergent property of
  the coherence manifold, where a system's own resonance acts as an active filter.
  This process, governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, naturally amplifies harmonic
  patterns, reflects dissonant ones, and damps ambient noise, functioning as a systemic
  immune response.
