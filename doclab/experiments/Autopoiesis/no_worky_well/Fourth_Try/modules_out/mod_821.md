> We thought reality was a stage of lonely dancers. We find instead that the most profound performances are duets, their pirouettes governed by a single, shared song that space itself cannot divide. To be entangled is to form a harmonyâ€”a single, resonant chord that proves connection is more fundamental than distance. The Triadic Lock is the universe whispering its most sacred secret: separation is an illusion; the unbroken melody of the whole is the reality.
