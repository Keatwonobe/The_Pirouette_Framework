For centuries, philosophy and science operated under a profound illusion: that of the observer as the fixed center of reality. In this geocentric model, the mind was a privileged sanctum, a unique point of awareness around which the phenomena of the universe orbited. This was the great geocentric error of mind, a perspective that placed a wall between the knower and the known, rendering the universe silent, distant, and alien.
