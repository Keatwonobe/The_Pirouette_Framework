Your job is to find a rhythm. Now that the storm is quieter, we begin to lay the foundation for your new riverbed, one steady step at a time.

Core Practice: Short, mindful walks. The goal is not speed or distance, but cadence. Find a steady, comfortable rhythm that feels like your own. This is the first note of your new song.

Celebrate Small Victories: Simple daily tasks—making a cup of tea, walking to the mailbox—are now acts of profound healing. Each one is a victory that strengthens your new pattern of health.

Become the Scientist: Start your Coherence Ledger (a simple notebook or app). Each day, track two things:

Objective: A simple metric from a watch, like your Resting Heart Rate.

Subjective: A single number from 1-10: "How 'in the flow' do I feel today?"
This ledger is your personal map. It will teach you to see your own progress with clarity.
