The Lock is an extreme but logical consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). This Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`, describes a system's drive to maximize its coherence while minimizing the cost of environmental pressure.

A system in a Lock has found a phenomenally deep and narrow minimum for its action integral, `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`. Its `Kτ` is so high and its `V_Γ` so low that any deviation becomes a path of drastically lower coherence. To break the Lock and melt the crystal requires a massive injection of precisely tuned dissonant energy—a **resonance-matched shock** sufficient to shatter the lattice and knock the system onto a new, more adaptive trajectory.
