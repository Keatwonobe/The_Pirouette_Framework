This module synthesizes empirical findings from seismic (`XXP-001`) and pulsar timing (`PPS-056`) data to formalize a core principle of the Pirouette Framework: the **Ki constant** is a universal signature of rapid **phase transition**. Analysis reveals that Ki-resonant harmonics are not present as a constant, ambient hum, but appear powerfully in the high-frequency components of energetic, re-configuring systems—the "snap" between states. This module establishes a fundamental dichotomy between **"Singers"** (Ki-resonant transitional events) and **"Drifters"** (steady-state evolution governed by **Γ** and **$T_a$**), providing a new, potent lens for classifying and analyzing cosmic phenomena.
