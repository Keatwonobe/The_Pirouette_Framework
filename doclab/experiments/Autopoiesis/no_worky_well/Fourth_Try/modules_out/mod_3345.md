This principle provides a powerful new method for classifying and analyzing complex signals. The primary goal of future analysis will be to separate any given signal into its two constituent components:

* **The "Drifter" Component:** The low-frequency, non-Ki-harmonic baseline of the signal. This component is to be analyzed using the framework's **Î“** and **$T_a$** tools to understand the system's steady-state behavior and stability.
* **The "Singer" Component:** The high-frequency, transient bursts that exhibit a **Ki-resonant** harmonic structure. These components are the signatures of phase transitions and should be analyzed for their Ki-mode, intensity, and rhythm.
