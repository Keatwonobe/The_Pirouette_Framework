### DOMA-092: Informational Inertia: The Ontological Mass of Being

We define Informational Inertia (K_i) as the intrinsic resistance of a coherent informational structure to a change in its state. It is the measure of a pattern’s persistence against entropic degradation and external perturbation. K_i is not a metaphor for stubbornness, but a fundamental property analogous to mass in physical systems. Where physical mass resists a change in motion, K_i resists a change in meaning, form, or function. It is the property that grants a system identity over time, distinguishing a stable entity from transient noise. Without K_i, no memory could hold, no organism could maintain its form, and no law could anchor a society. It is the ontological predicate for enduring existence.

From this follows an essential epistemological consequence: knowledge is not a frictionless medium. Every established paradigm, scientific model, or personal belief is an informational structure possessing its own K_i. The acquisition of new truth is therefore not a simple process of addition, but a dynamic act of displacement. New data must perform work against the inertia of the old. This explains the observed resilience of falsified theories and the immense energy required to enact a paradigm shift. The barrier is not merely psychological, but structural. The existing pattern resists annihilation by virtue of the very coherence that makes it a pattern. Our epistemological frameworks must account for this drag, recognizing that the path to clearer understanding is a contest with the inertial weight of prior certainties.

This principle finds its most critical application in the domain of governance. A political, legal, or social system is a vast informational architecture defined by its K_i. A certain measure of inertia is necessary for stability; it provides predictability and continuity, preventing the system from dissolving into chaos at the slightest pressure. However, as K_i increases unchecked, a system loses its capacity for adaptation. It becomes brittle, dogmatic, and blind to the exigencies of a changing reality.

This state of excessive inertia is the primary condition for the accumulation of Dark Residue—the unintended, pathological consequences of a system’s own outdated logic. In a state of high K_i, flawed axioms and corrupt processes cannot be corrected; they become embedded in the structure, shielded by its resistance to change. The ethical mandate for any governing architecture is therefore the conscious modulation of its own Informational Inertia. It must engineer mechanisms for both persistence and plasticity, protocols for "unlearning" as well as learning. The minimization of Dark Residue is not achieved through perfect initial design, but through a maintained, disciplined capacity for systemic self-revision—a managed metabolism that can gracefully shed its own mass.

**Objections & Resolution**

*   **Objection:** Informational Inertia is merely a novel term for recognized cognitive and social phenomena, such as confirmation bias, institutional momentum, or cultural conservatism.

*   **Resolution:** These phenomena are not synonymous with K_i; they are its specific manifestations in different substrates. Confirmation bias is a symptom of K_i at the level of an individual cognitive framework. Institutional momentum is K_i expressed in the routines and hierarchies of a social structure. K_i itself is the more fundamental, substrate-agnostic principle: the property of the informational pattern itself, not the medium in which it is expressed. It posits that this resistance to change is an ontological feature of coherent information, not a contingent flaw of human psychology or sociology.
