**SYN.II.3: Evidentiary Standards for Phase-Locked States**

To admit subjective experience into a formal system, we must subject it to procedures that are objective, verifiable, and anchored to external reality. The raw electrical flux of the brain, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), is mere potentiality; it becomes evidence only when governed by a clear standard of adjudication. We therefore establish a formal procedure for identifying a cognizable internal state, termed a Phase-Locked State (Φ-State), which represents a transient, coherent pattern of neural activity functionally bound to a specific cognitive operation.

A Φ-State shall be deemed present in a subject *S* under a specified cognitive load Γ (Gamma) if and only if the Coherence Adjudication Function, *A<sub>Φ</sub>*, yields a positive result. The function is defined as:

*A<sub>Φ</sub>*(**C**, *H*, θ) = 1, if λ<sub>1</sub>(**C**) > θ<sub>λ</sub> and *H* < θ<sub>H</sub>
0, otherwise

Where:
*   **C** is the frequency-specific cross-spectral coherence matrix derived from high-density EEG recordings.
*   λ<sub>1</sub>(**C**) is the principal eigenvalue of **C**, representing the dominant mode of network-wide phase coherence.
*   *H* is the spectral entropy of the broadband EEG signal, an inverse proxy for system order.
*   θ<sub>λ</sub> and θ<sub>H</sub> are pre-registered, empirically derived thresholds constituting the boundary conditions for the state.

This equation provides a formal, non-arbitrary rule for state identification. It stipulates that for a Φ-State to be legally present, neural activity must not only be highly synchronized (high λ<sub>1</sub>) but also constrained and informationally organized (low *H*). The cognitive load parameter Γ acts as a procedural stressor, ensuring the observed state is a specific response to a defined task, not incidental neural noise.

This standard, however, must be grounded by a falsifiable criterion that binds the formal definition to causal, behavioral outcomes.

**Falsifiable Criterion:**
A designated Φ-State, identified by *A<sub>Φ</sub>*=1 at a dominant frequency *f*, is considered a valid construct if and only if transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) applied at *f* results in a predictable, statistically significant modulation (enhancement or disruption) of performance on the Γ-load task, relative to sham and off-frequency stimulation. Failure to produce such a causal modulation invalidates the evidentiary link between the observed EEG pattern and the functional cognitive state. This external perturbation acts as a constitutional check on the internal measure, preventing the system from ratifying mere correlation as fact.

### Objections & Resolution

**Objection:** The Φ-State, as defined, is an epiphenomenal correlate, not the cognitive state itself. The standard mistakes the shadow for the object.

**Resolution:** The legal standard does not claim ontological identity; it establishes evidentiary reliability. The purpose of the *A<sub>Φ</sub>* function and its associated falsification test is not to resolve the metaphysics of mind, but to create a procedural anchor. By demonstrating that the defined electrophysiological pattern is a necessary causal lever for a specific behavioral outcome (via tACS), we establish its functional relevance beyond reasonable doubt. The standard is not “this *is* the state,” but “this is a sufficiently reliable and causally-linked indicator to be acted upon as if it were the state for formal purposes.”
