### **[XXP-012] Electron g-2 Anomaly & Γ-Field Calibration**

Axiomatic systems are covenants; their claims must be adjudicated against external, impartial standards. The anomalous magnetic moment of the electron presents a near-perfect tribunal for physical theory. Its value is measured with extraordinary precision, establishing a non-negotiable benchmark against which all claims of causality must be tested. Here, we submit the framework's foundational geometric postulate to this same unforgiving standard.

We define terms with formal strictness:
1.  The **gyromagnetic ratio (g)** is a dimensionless constant relating a particle's magnetic moment to its angular momentum. For a point-like, classical Dirac particle, theory stipulates g = 2.
2.  The **anomalous magnetic moment (aₑ)** is the measured deviation from this classical integer value, defined as `aₑ ≡ (g - 2) / 2`. This anomaly constitutes a material breach of the classical description, demanding a more fundamental accounting.
3.  The **Γ-Field** is posited as the geometric substrate through which a particle's coherence manifold interacts with its own resonant past. This is not an interaction mediated by virtual particles, but a direct, topological self-relation.

Our governing postulate asserts that the primary contribution to the anomaly arises from the simplest possible self-interaction geometry: a single rotational cycle of the particle's wave function intersecting with itself. The strength of this interaction is anchored to the fine-structure constant (α), an externally verified measure of electromagnetic coupling. The geometry of the interaction is captured by a topological constant, `C_g`, representing the structure of this self-resonant "echo." For a single, closed cycle, this constant is `1/(2π)`.

The framework thus produces a primary, testable ordinance:

`aₑ = α / 2π`  (Eq. 1)

This equation is not an approximation derived from a perturbative series, but a direct statement of first-order geometric cause. It asserts that the electron's anomalous moment is the product of the fundamental strength of its interactive nature (α) and the fundamental geometry of self-relation (a single cycle, `1/(2π)`). Using the CODATA 2018 value for α (≈ 1/137.035999), our ordinance predicts `aₑ ≈ 0.0011614096`. This stands in agreement with the measured experimental value to an exceptionally high degree of precision.

This result serves as the primary **calibration protocol** for the Γ-Field. The electron, being the most stable and least complex lepton, provides the baseline case. Its near-perfect adherence to Eq. 1 anchors the geometric interpretation of the fine-structure constant within this system. All further predictions, particularly those concerning more complex leptons like the muon ([XXP-013]), proceed from this initial, legally binding precedent.

#### **Objections & Resolution**

*   **Objection:** The result `α/2π` is identical to the first-order QED correction calculated by Schwinger in 1948. This framework merely re-labels an existing calculation, offering no new predictive content and claiming a novel origin for a known effect.

*   **Resolution:** The objection is conceded in part; the numerical identity is the entire point of the validation. However, the claim is not one of numerical novelty but of causal parsimony and formal elegance. Standard Model QED derives this term from the complex apparatus of virtual photon emission and reabsorption. Our framework derives it as a direct, necessary consequence of a particle's geometric self-interaction. The systems are legally distinct. The final adjudication rests on a single, falsifiable criterion:

    **Falsifiable Criterion:** The framework is nullified if the observed muon anomalous magnetic moment (`a_μ`), or any subsequent higher-order lepton anomaly, cannot be derived as a consequence of this same geometric model, using calculable terms that correspond to the increased topological complexity of the heavier particle's coherence manifold. If the model requires ad-hoc adjustments indistinguishable from curve-fitting, its claim to a more fundamental basis is void.
