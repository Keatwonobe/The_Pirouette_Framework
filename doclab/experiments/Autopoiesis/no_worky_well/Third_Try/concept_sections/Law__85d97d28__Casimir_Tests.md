### **APP.II: Casimir-Type Null Hypothesis Protocol**

The theoretical architecture proposed herein requires anchorage in observable phenomena. Its claims, particularly those positing a causal link between the galactic-scale structuring force (`\ell\Gamma`) and a novel fundamental interaction, must be subject to a dispositive, terrestrial test. This protocol establishes the formal procedure for such a test, defining the criteria for either corroboration or falsification. The validity of the system rests upon its accountability to these external, empirical arbiters.

The central testable prediction is the existence of a new short-range force, mediated by the `\Gamma`-field, which modifies the Newtonian inverse-square law at microscopic separations. This interaction is described by an effective Yukawa potential, `V_{\Gamma}(r)`, between two test masses:

`V_{\Gamma}(r) = \alpha_{\Gamma} \frac{e^{-r/\lambda_{\Gamma}}}{r}`

Here, `r` is the separation distance between the masses. The equation is governed by two fundamental parameters: the dimensionless coupling constant, `\alpha_{\Gamma}`, which dictates the strength of the interaction relative to gravity, and the characteristic range, `\lambda_{\Gamma}`, which corresponds to the Compton wavelength of the force-mediating particle. The cosmological assertions of the parent theory—specifically, the flattening of galactic rotation curves—constrain the viable parameter space for `\lambda_{\Gamma}` to the `10^{-5}` to `10^{-3}` meter range. This brings the hypothesis within the precise investigatory domain of modern torsion-balance and Casimir-force experiments.

A direct, falsifiable criterion is therefore established.

**Falsification Criterion:** The core tenets of the theory linking `\ell\Gamma` to galactic dynamics are declared falsified if a qualified laboratory experiment, designed to measure force deviations at the length scale `\lambda_{\Gamma}`, fails to reject the null hypothesis (`H₀`) at a confidence level of 5σ.

*   **Hypothesis (H₁):** A non-gravitational, non-electromagnetic force consistent with the potential `V_{\Gamma}(r)` is present, causing a statistically significant deviation from the established inverse-square law for `r < 1` mm.
*   **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** No such force is detected. All measurements remain consistent with Standard Model physics and General Relativity, once all conventional systematic effects (e.g., electrostatic, magnetic, thermal) are accounted for.

A null result from such an experiment would constitute a definitive legal boundary. It would invalidate any claim that the `\Gamma`-field is responsible for the observed galactic-scale phenomena, as the laboratory-scale mechanism required for that link would be proven non-existent within the predicted parameter space. The theory would be, in its present form, injuncted from making such claims.

**Objections & Resolution**

*   **Objection:** The coupling constant, `\alpha_{\Gamma}`, might be too small for current instruments to detect, allowing the theory to evade falsification indefinitely by retreating into experimentally inaccessible regions of its parameter space.
*   **Resolution:** This protocol is not a search for a specific value but a procedure for imposing a legal limit. A null result is not an experimental failure; it is a successful constraint that places a binding upper bound on `\alpha_{\Gamma}` for a given `\lambda_{\Gamma}`. If the region of parameter space required for the theory’s cosmological utility is ruled out-of-bounds by this experimental precedent, the theory is falsified in that application, regardless of whether a weaker manifestation might exist.

*   **Objection:** A positive signal could be produced by an unknown systematic error or an entirely different physical phenomenon, leading to false corroboration.
*   **Resolution:** The burden of proof rests on the experiment to demonstrate that the signal’s functional dependence on distance `r` matches the `V_{\Gamma}(r)` form and cannot be explained by known physics. Corroboration is a provisional status, contingent on independent replication and the failure of all attempts to attribute the signal to mundane sources. The protocol provides grounds for a hearing, not a final verdict.
