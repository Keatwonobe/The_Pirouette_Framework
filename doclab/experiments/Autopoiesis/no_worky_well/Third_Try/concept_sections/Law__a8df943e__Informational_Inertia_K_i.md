APP / MATH-028: Informational Inertia (*K*·µ¢)
***

The constitution of any stable system, whether physical or abstract, contains an implicit law of inertia: a body in a state of uniform motion remains in that state unless an external force is applied. We extend this principle from the domain of mass and momentum to that of information and coherence. We hereby define Informational Inertia, symbolized *K*·µ¢, as a fundamental and measurable property of a system, representing its intrinsic resistance to a change in its state of Coherence. It is the formal measure of a system‚Äôs commitment to its own established order.

Where Coherence (*C*) is the measure of a system‚Äôs internal consistency and structural integrity, and a Coherence Force (*F*ùí∏) is any externally applied informational input intended to alter that state, Informational Inertia (*K*·µ¢) is decreed by the following relation:

> *F*ùí∏ ‚âú *K*·µ¢ ‚ãÖ (d*C*/d*t*)

This equation is not a metaphor, but a foundational law of system dynamics. It posits that the magnitude of force required to produce a change in a system‚Äôs coherence is directly proportional to the system‚Äôs inertia. A system with high *K*·µ¢‚Äîa mature legal code, a deeply embedded social custom, a stable ecosystem‚Äîwill resist perturbation, demanding significant and sustained force to alter its trajectory. Conversely, a system with low *K*·µ¢ is volatile, its state easily swayed by minor inputs. *K*·µ¢ thus serves as the primary legal barrier to arbitrary intervention. It establishes a formal burden of proof: to justify an act of systemic revision, the intervening agent must demonstrate a capacity to exert a Coherence Force sufficient to overcome the system‚Äôs native inertia.

This principle provides a basis for a rational conservatism in governance. It grounds the legal doctrine of *stare decisis* not in mere tradition, but in the quantifiable stability of the legal-informational structure itself. To overturn precedent is to apply an immense *F*ùí∏ to a system of high *K*·µ¢, an act whose consequences must be calculated against the risk of decoherence.

### Falsifiable Criterion

The principle of Informational Inertia is subject to empirical falsification. The theory is invalid if, for a well-defined information system (e.g., a formal axiomatic system, a version-controlled codebase, or a blockchain protocol), the following test fails:

1.  A baseline Coherence metric (*C*) and a unit of Coherence Force (*F*ùí∏) are axiomatically defined and made measurable for the system.
2.  The system‚Äôs intrinsic *K*·µ¢ is calculated based on its structural properties (e.g., network density, code complexity, logical depth).
3.  A series of known *F*ùí∏ are applied to the system.
4.  The observed rate of Coherence change (d*C*/d*t*) is measured.

If the observed d*C*/d*t* deviates from the predicted value (*F*ùí∏ / *K*·µ¢) in a manner that is statistically significant and cannot be accounted for by measurement error or undeclared external forces, the formulation is to be rejected.

### Objections & Resolution

**Objection:** The constituent terms, particularly *F*ùí∏ and *C*, are abstract constructs. Their quantification is non-trivial and may be domain-specific, rendering *K*·µ¢ an inoperable concept.

**Resolution:** The difficulty of metrology does not invalidate the legality of the principle. This framework provides the formal structure for measurement, decreeing its necessity. The operationalization of these terms for even a single class of formal systems provides the external anchor necessary for the theory's validation. The law does not require that all systems be immediately measurable, only that the standard of measurement exists and is held as the final arbiter of claims. The burden is on the system architect or governor to develop the instruments of measure, not on the law to soften its demand for evidence.
