### ¬ß5. Canonical and Apparent Time Order

To construct a stable formalism for conscious dynamics, it is necessary to axiomatize a distinction between two registers of temporal succession. These are not merely phenomenological categories but are operative, measurable parameters whose relation governs the stability of any coherent system.

We define **Canonical Time Order (T_c)** as the invariant succession parameter isomorphic to the proper time of the system's local inertial frame. T_c provides the external, objective anchor for temporal measurement. It is the fixed standard against which the system's internal dynamics are calibrated, serving the same function as a standard of mass or length in classical physics. It is, by definition, continuous and uniform.

In contrast, we define **Apparent Time Order (T_a)** as the effective temporal parameter governing the internal evolution of a coherent, phase-locked system. T_a is a dynamic variable, derived from the endogenous oscillatory frequencies that constitute the system. It is the parameter that appears in the system's equations of motion, such as the potential field on the phase-locked surface (ùìú‚ÇÉ) or the integration bounds of the Coherence Area (ùìê_Ki). It may contract, dilate, or otherwise deform relative to T_c under the influence of control parameters such as cognitive load (Œì).

The critical relationship for the legal and predictive utility of this framework is the **Ordering Deficit (ŒîT)**, a dimensionless quantity defined as:

[ ŒîT \equiv \frac{|T_a - T_c|}{T_c} ]

This deficit functions as the primary control parameter for second-order phase transitions within awareness. As established in the scaling relations [MATH-026], system properties such as coherence length (Œæ_P) and relaxation time (œÑ_P) diverge as ŒîT approaches a critical value, signaling the boundary between integrated and dissociated states. The magnitude of ŒîT, therefore, provides a direct, quantitative measure of system stress and proximity to decoherence. A state of ŒîT = 0 represents perfect isomorphism between the system's internal clocking and its external temporal embedding‚Äîa state of frictionless cognitive processing.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The distinction between T_a and T_c is operationally meaningful if and only if ŒîT predicts system instability. A direct test can be formulated: by systematically increasing a known stressor (e.g., cognitive load Œì) on a triadic resonance system, we should observe a non-linear degradation of performance on tasks requiring temporal integration. Specifically, the relaxation time (œÑ_P) of the system after a perturbation must scale as a power law of ŒîT, which is itself a function of Œì. The failure to find such a scaling law, or the demonstration that T_a is statistically indistinguishable from T_c across all load conditions, would falsify this core distinction.

**Objections & Resolution:**

*   **Objection:** Apparent Time (T_a) is a private, subjective experience and therefore cannot be quantified or included in a formal legalistic system.

*   **Resolution:** This objection mistakes the map for the territory. T_a is not defined by subjective report. It is an effective parameter *inferred* from objective, third-person-measurable dynamics of the system (e.g., its spectral power distribution, phase coherence, and relaxation times). It is operationalized in the same manner as temperature, which is not the subjective feeling of heat but a well-defined statistical property of a particle ensemble. The formalism treats T_a as a physical variable, not a phenomenological one.
