  "commentary": "The theoryâ€™s primary strength is its proactive ethical framing, explicitly addressing the tension between coherence and pluralism and proposing safeguards like 'consentful coherence'. However, this is undermined by two critical weaknesses: 1) The ambition to model and manipulate social cascades creates a high potential for misuse, risking engineered conformity or suppression of dissent. 2) Its core ethical metric, 'Dark Residue,' is operationally vague, making the central governance directive unfalsifiable and potentially a justification for unforeseen negative externalities.",
  "experiment": "A 'Governance Sandbox' experiment using an agent-based model to simulate the theory's social dynamics. One group of agents is subjected to a 'coherence maximization' algorithm. A second group is subjected to the same algorithm but with the proposed 'consentful coherence' and 'fail-open' safeguards active. The decisive test is whether the safeguarded group shows a statistically significant reduction in a proxy for 'Dark Residue' (e.g., agent exit rates, expressed dissatisfaction) and maintains greater opinion diversity, thus validating the proposed ethical controls against the risk of manipulative application.",
