  "commentary": "The theory's primary strength is its attempt to ground ethics in a non-arbitrary, naturalistic principle of 'coherence,' potentially offering a shared language to resolve collective action problems. However, this strength is overshadowed by two critical weaknesses. First, the framework is ripe for totalitarian misuse; a 'Civilizational Resonance Index' could become a scientific-sounding justification for suppressing dissent (unwanted Probes) and enforcing ideological conformity (a static Model) to minimize 'Dissonance.' Second, it commits a profound naturalistic fallacy by conflating systemic persistence with moral good. A perfectly 'coherent' and stable system of oppression would be deemed 'healthy' by this metric, revealing an ethical void where principles of justice, rights, and individual dignity should be.",
  "experiment": "A decisive test of the theory's ethical claims requires a historical comparative analysis. Identify two societies with comparable technological advancement ('Ï‰_P'), one being a stable, 'coherent' authoritarian state and the other a 'dissonant,' pluralistic but liberalizing democracy. Measure both not only with the theory's proposed proxies but also against independent, well-established indices of human rights, minority protections, and individual flourishing (e.g., Human Development Index). If the 'coherent' society consistently scores lower on these external ethical measures, it would falsify the theory's central claim that maximizing systemic coherence is a sufficient basis for 'the Good,' proving it is an inadequate framework for justice.",
