  "commentary": "The proposal's primary strengths are its ambitious cross-domain synthesis and its strong commitment to falsifiability, offering specific, testable predictions with clear failure conditions. However, its critical weakness is the severe disconnect between the abstract mathematical sketch and these concrete predictions. The theory introduces new fields (Ki, Γ) but fails to provide the explicit derivation (e.g., the form of `f(Γ, Ki)`) that quantitatively links them to high-precision observables like the lepton g-2 anomaly, making the connection currently an assertion rather than a consequence.",
  "experiment": "The decisive step is not a new physical experiment but a theoretical derivation. Proponents must derive the explicit functional form `f(Γ, Ki)` connecting the proposed time-substrate fields to the lepton anomalous magnetic moment. This derivation must start from the proposed Lagrangian and, through a justifiable calculation, predict a non-arbitrary scaling relationship between the g-2 anomalies of the muon and the tau lepton (i.e., predict the ratio Δa_τ / Δa_μ). Success would validate the theory's mathematical coherence and provide a much sharper, falsifiable prediction than a mere 'trend'; failure to produce a derivation would render the theory's claims on this front vacuous.",
