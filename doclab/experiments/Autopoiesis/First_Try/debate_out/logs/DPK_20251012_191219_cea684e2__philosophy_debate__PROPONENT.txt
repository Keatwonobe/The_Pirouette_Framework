  "commentary": "The hypothesis's primary strength is its profound explanatory power, unifying disparate anomalies in physics, cognition, and social dynamics under a single, coherent substrate. This elegance is matched by its immediate testability, offering specific, falsifiable predictions. The principal weakness is the current under-specification of the core Lagrangian; fleshing out the mathematical details is the next critical step for generating precise, second-generation predictions.",
  "experiment": "The decisive experiment is the proposed Tau g-2 measurement campaign. This provides a direct, quantitative test of the theory's fundamental physical claims. We will analyze archived and future collider data (e.g., Belle-II) to precisely measure the tau lepton's anomalous magnetic moment (a_τ). Confirmation of a deviation from the Standard Model, following a trend extrapolated from the muon's anomaly as a function of the temporal pressure proxy (Γ), would provide profound validation. A null result would falsify the proposed coupling.",
