  "commentary": "The framework's primary strength is its explicit inclusion of ethical governance, acknowledging the tension between collective coherence and pluralism. However, this is undermined by two critical weaknesses. First, the core directive to optimize for a 'total enthalpy gain' while minimizing an undefined 'Dark Residue' creates a dangerously utilitarian calculus that could justify suppressing minority rights for an ambiguous greater good. Second, the proposed safeguards like 'consentful coherence' are vague, providing a veneer of ethical concern without concrete mechanisms, thus risking the legitimation of sophisticated social engineering and control.",
  "experiment": "Propose a 'Minority Resonance Game': A multi-agent simulation where group success requires coordination (coherence), but a pre-defined minority of agents possess conflicting information that is beneficial in the long-term. The experiment would test whether the theory's proposed 'governance triggers' and 'consentful coherence' mechanisms can be implemented to protect the minority's dissent from being sacrificed for short-term global optimization. The decisive outcome is whether the safeguards prove to be robust protections for pluralism or merely justifications for overriding dissent.",
