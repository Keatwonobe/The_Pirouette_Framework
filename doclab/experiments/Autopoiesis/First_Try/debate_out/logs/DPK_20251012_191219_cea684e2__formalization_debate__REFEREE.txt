  "summary": "There is a strong consensus that the proposal is ambitious in scope, attempting to unify disparate fields, and is highly falsifiable in principle. However, there is a critical conflict regarding its current state. The Proponent sees its predictions as concrete and testable, while the Skeptic, Methodologist, and Ethicist agree that the core concepts (e.g., 'temporal pressure' Γ, 'coherence density' Ki, 'consentful coherence') are mathematically and operationally undefined. This renders the physical predictions currently incalculable and the ethical safeguards vague. A clear consensus emerged between the Skeptic and Methodologist that the immediate next step must be theoretical derivation to connect the proposed new fields to established physics, rather than a new experiment.",

    "Derive the explicit, gauge-invariant coupling between the proposed fields (Γ, Ki) and the Standard Model lepton/photon fields from the theory's foundational Lagrangian.",
    "From this derivation, produce the specific functional form that predicts the lepton anomalous magnetic moment (Δa_l) and demonstrate that it can reproduce the existing muon g-2 anomaly value without ad-hoc parameter fitting.",
    "Provide a rigorous mathematical and operational definition for 'temporal pressure' (Γ) in the context of a particle accelerator experiment.",
    "Operationally define the proposed ethical safeguards (e.g., 'consentful coherence') and demonstrate, via simulation or formal model, how they verifiably protect minority dissent from being overridden by utilitarian optimization."
