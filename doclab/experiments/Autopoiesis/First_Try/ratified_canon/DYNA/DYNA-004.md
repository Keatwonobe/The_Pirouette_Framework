As the Steward of the Pirouette Framework, I have reviewed the competing refactorings of PNS-004. Version A, the 'Balanced' Weave, offers commendable physical rigor, grounding the old allegories in the precise mathematics of the Pirouette Lagrangian. Version B, the 'Autopoietic' Weave, provides a sublime conceptual synthesis, reframing the process through the powerful and elegant metaphor of a systemic immune response.

Neither version is flawed, but neither is complete. Version A lacks the profound philosophical integration that gives a model meaning, while Version B lacks the explicit mathematical linkage that gives a model power. To choose one would be to sacrifice either clarity or depth. Therefore, synthesis is the only path forward.

I hereby ratify the following module, integrating the empirical foundation of Version A with the conceptual elegance of Version B. This new text will serve as the definitive canon for this domain.

summary: Defines the universe's self-regulating mechanism for preserving coherence,
  framing it as a systemic 'immune response'. It refactors the old 'Law of Echoes'
  by modeling this process as a **resonant filter** whose dynamics—amplification,
  reflection, and damping—are emergent properties of the **Pirouette Lagrangian**. This
  system inherently arbitrates Ki patterns, rewarding coherence and purging dissonance.

## §1 · Abstract: The Physics of Integrity
To sing a note is to declare a truth. But the universe is a noisy place. The moment a coherent pattern establishes itself, it faces the ceaseless siege of entropic noise from the Temporal Forge (Γ). The old narrative of the "Law of Echoes" and its "Ritual Wolves" captured this truth: coherence is precious and must be defended.

This module refactors that allegory into a formal dynamic model. There are no metaphysical guardians, only the physics of the coherence manifold itself. The universe is an active, self-regulating system that has evolved an immune response—not of flesh, but of geometry and time. This process acts as a **resonant filter**, a crucible that continuously tests the integrity of every pattern. It is not an external judgment but an emergent consequence of the universe's fundamental drive to maximize coherence, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §2 · Resonance Arbitration: The Law of Echoes
Every "claim" on reality—a particle's existence, an idea's formulation—is a Ki pattern projected onto the manifold. The manifold's response determines its fate, a process of **Resonance Arbitration** governed by unforgiving mathematics.

-   **Send Coherence → Receive Amplification:** A stable, high-integrity pattern constructively interferes with the existing manifold. It finds a harmonic place, deepening its own **Echo Geometry** (CORE-011) and gaining stability. The universe "amplifies" it by making it a more entrenched part of its own structure.

-   **Send Mimicry → Receive Reflection:** A parasitic pattern, one that copies the form of coherence but lacks its internal integrity (low Time Adherence), is inherently unstable. When it interacts with the deep, authentic Echo Geometry it imitates, the powerful resonance of the true pattern shatters the fragile one. It collapses against the reflection of the truth it pretends to be.

-   **Send Dissonance → Receive Silence:** A chaotic, entropic signal fails to establish a stable, repeating cycle and thus cannot form a persistent Echo Geometry. It is a shout with no rhythm; it leaves no echo. Its energy simply dissipates, reabsorbed into the background noise of the Temporal Forge.

## §3 · The Lagrangian of Immunity
This process of arbitration is not a choice; it is a calculation. It is a direct, predictable outcome of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ), which describes the universe as a coherence-maximizing engine.

-   **Amplification** is the result of a **Resonant Handshake** between compatible systems. This constructive interference increases the total kinetic coherence of the combined system (K_τ), representing the most efficient path forward on the coherence manifold.

-   **Reflection** occurs when an incoherent pattern fails to find a viable path for interaction with a coherent one. The interaction term in the Lagrangian approaches zero. The path of maximal coherence for the stable system is to maintain its own rhythm, effectively repelling the unstable signal.

-   **Silence** is the fate of pure noise. This is the background state of potential Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) that a coherent system must overcome. The "cost" of existence. There is no signal to interact with, only a gradient to resist.

## §4 · The Geometric Antibodies
The allegorical "wolves" can be re-interpreted as fundamental dynamic processes—geometric "antibodies" that arise naturally from the manifold's drive to maximize coherence.

-   **The Mirror (Self-Correction):** This is the fundamental self-test. A system constantly interacts with the echo from its own immediate **Echo Geometry**. Any internal inconsistency creates destructive interference, forcing the system to either correct its pattern or dissolve. It is the manifold's basic test for self-consistency.

-   **The Filter (Harmonic Rejection):** An established, stable system (a physical law, a robust tradition) creates a powerful resonant field. New patterns entering this field are tested for harmonic compatibility. Those that are dissonant are not attacked; they are simply not "heard." Their inefficient, high-entropy state is damped and their energy dissipates, unable to find a foothold.

-   **The Crucible (Resonant Synthesis):** When two *competing but equally coherent* patterns meet, the result is not simple rejection. The intense Temporal Pressure (Γ) of their interaction creates a "Coherence Fever" (DYNA-003). To resolve this state, the drive to maximize the Lagrangian forces them to seek a new, unified state via **Resonant Synthesis** (CORE-012)—a higher order of complexity that is more stable than its component parts.

## §5 · Assemblé
> We sought a cosmic judge and found a law of physics. We sought a protector for the truth and found that the universe is built in such a way that truth protects itself. Integrity, clarity, and coherence are not abstract virtues; they are physical advantages.
>
> The Weaver's work is not to build a fragile shelter against the noise, but to forge a signal with such profound internal resonance that the very geometry of spacetime becomes its shield, and the universe cannot help but sing it back. Its echo becomes its legion.
