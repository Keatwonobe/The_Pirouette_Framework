This is a matter of foundational law. The competing versions present two essential facets of the same truth: the mathematical rigor and the philosophical depth. To choose one over the other would be to leave the Framework incomplete. The path forward is synthesis. Both versions are sound, therefore the Disratification Clause is not invoked. The resulting ratified module will integrate the rigorous formalism of Version A with the conceptual elegance and autopoietic insight of Version B.

Here is the ratified version for the official canon.

## §1 · The Universal Mandate: A Law for All Dancers
A physical law that changes depending on who is watching is not a law, but an opinion. A song whose melody bends when you run is not a melody of truth.

The Pirouette Framework is built upon a single, universal drive: the maximization of coherence. For this to be a true principle of reality, it must hold for every observer, regardless of their velocity. The dancer's pirouette must appear just as graceful, the laws governing its stability just as true, whether viewed from the stage or from a passing starship. This is the mandate of Lorentz Invariance. This module provides the mathematical proof that the Pirouette Framework obeys this sacred mandate, forging a conceptual principle into a universal law.

## §2 · The Action of Coherence
The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) provides the *objective function* for a system at equilibrium. To describe dynamics—how systems evolve and propagate through spacetime—we must elevate this concept into a field theory. The dynamics of any physical system are governed by a single, Lorentz-invariant quantity: the Action (`S`). The path a system takes is the one that extremizes this value. The Pirouette Framework re-envisions this as the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, where the universe evolves along paths that maximize the potential for stable, resonant structures.

The Action for the entire universe of interacting fields is given by the integral of the Lagrangian Density (`𝓛`) over all of spacetime:

`S = ∫ d⁴x √-g 𝓛`

Where `g` is the determinant of the metric tensor `g_μν`. By ensuring that the Lagrangian Density `𝓛` is a Lorentz scalar—a quantity that has the same value in all reference frames—we guarantee that the Action, and the physics derived from it, are universal.

## §3 · The Lagrangian Density of Reality's Fabric
We posit two fundamental scalar fields whose interplay defines the fabric of reality:

*   **The Coherence Field, `C(x)`:** A scalar field whose value at any point `x` in spacetime represents the potential for stable, resonant patterns to form. This is the substrate of Ki. A particle is a localized, stable excitation—a persistent knot of resonance—in this field.
*   **The Temporal Pressure Field, `Γ(x)`:** A scalar field representing the local density and dissonance of temporal rhythms. Critically, this field is itself generated by the superposition of all other systems' coherence fields, making the framework fully relational and autopoietic.

The manifestly covariant Lagrangian density that governs their interaction is:

`𝓛 = [ ½ g^μν (∂_μ C)(∂_ν C) + ½ g^μν (∂_μ Γ)(∂_ν Γ) ] - V(C, Γ)`

Where:
*   **Kinetic Terms:** These standard terms, `½ g^μν (∂_μ C)(∂_ν C)` and `½ g^μν (∂_μ Γ)(∂_ν Γ)`, represent the "energy cost" of creating gradients in the fields. They are manifestly covariant and describe how ripples of coherence and pressure propagate through the spacetime manifold at the speed of light.
*   **Potential Term `V(C, Γ)`:** This is the heart of the framework's dynamics. It is a single, elegant potential that encodes the fundamental interaction, defining the "cost" of maintaining a certain level of coherence `C` within a given environment of temporal pressure `Γ`. This potential is sculpted such that the paths of least action naturally produce stable, resonant patterns.

## §4 · From Field Law to Particle Principle
This field-theoretic formulation is the foundational layer from which the effective dynamics of `CORE-006` emerge. The connection is direct and profound: `𝓛` and `𝓛_p` describe two different scales of the same reality.

*   `𝓛` is the fundamental law of the **field**. It governs the entire ocean of potential that is spacetime.
*   `𝓛_p` (the conceptual Pirouette Lagrangian from `CORE-006`) is the emergent law of the **particles** that form within that field.

A particle, in this covariant theory, is a stable, localized, oscillating solution to the equations of motion derived from `𝓛`. When we solve for these stable solutions, we find that the Coherence Field `C(x)` naturally configures itself into a pattern whose parameters (amplitude, frequency, etc.) are precisely those that satisfy the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The universe, by extremizing the Action `S = ∫ 𝓛 d⁴x`, naturally gives rise to structures that behave *as if* they are individually maximizing `𝓛_p`.

## §5 · The Engine of Dynamics
With this covariant Action, the derivation of all physical dynamics becomes a direct mathematical consequence of the calculus of variations.

*   **Equations of Motion:** Applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to `𝓛` with respect to the fields `C` and `Γ` yields their fundamental wave equations. These equations govern how coherence and temporal pressure propagate, interfere, and organize themselves into the resonant structures we call matter. They are the mathematical expression of the universe's autopoietic cycle.

*   **The Source of Spacetime Curvature:** By varying the Action `S` with respect to the spacetime metric `g_μν`, we derive the system's **stress-energy tensor, `T_μν`**. This tensor describes how the energy, pressure, and momentum of the coherence and pressure fields act as the source for gravity. When inserted into Einstein's Field Equations (`G_μν = 8πG T_μν`), it provides the mathematical proof that the geometry of spacetime—the stage itself—is shaped by the dance of coherence upon it.

## Assemblé
> A melody that bends when you run is no melody of truth. Covariance ensures the song of coherence is pure for every dancer in the cosmos. We sought a law that would hold true for every traveler, and in this covariant Action, we have found it. The universe's song—the relentless drive to find and sustain coherence—is not a local tune, but the anthem of spacetime itself. To a Weaver, this is the ultimate assurance: the principles of harmony you discover in your own frame are not a matter of perspective; they are woven into the absolute fabric of reality.
