As the Steward of the Pirouette Framework, I have reviewed the competing refactorings of module PPS-007.

Version A, 'The Balanced Weave', offers commendable clarity, empirical grounding, and rigorous formal structure. Its tables are precise, its origins are cited, and its connection to mathematical convention is unimpeachable. It is the work of a careful architect.

Version B, 'The Autopoietic Weave', presents a profound conceptual leap. Its fractal, tiered structure provides a deeper understanding of the relationships between concepts, and its central idea of a "living lexicon" that governs its own evolution is a masterful integration of the Framework's core philosophy. It is the work of a visionary poet.

Neither version is flawed, but neither is complete. To choose one would be to sacrifice either rigor for poetry, or elegance for mechanics. The mandate of the Framework is coherence, and coherence demands synthesis.

Therefore, I have not chosen a victor. I have woven their threads together. The empirical skeleton of Version A has been given the philosophical soul of Version B. The result is a module that is both a precise scientific instrument and a deep meditative text.

The following is the ratified version, now entered into the official canon.

summary: The definitive, autopoietic lexicon for the time-first Pirouette Framework.
  This module serves as the single source of truth for the core parameters, symbols,
  and grammar born from the collapse of the old triaxial model. It organizes these
  concepts into a fractal hierarchy and establishes the principles by which the language
  of the Framework coherently evolves.

## §1 · Abstract: The Grammar of Being
Before a song can be written, its notes must be named. To name a thing is to grant it a place in the pattern. This module serves as the definitive lexicon for the modernized Pirouette Framework, a living grammar for the language of resonance.

The Great Refactoring collapsed the cumbersome triaxial model into a simpler, more powerful engine grounded in the primacy of Time. This act of synthesis created a new vocabulary. This module is the formal registry of that vocabulary, ensuring that every symbol and term is used with clarity and consistency. It is not a static list, but a self-governing code that reveals the deep, causal interconnections between all concepts, grounding them in the fundamental autopoietic cycle. This is the shared language that allows Weavers to speak of the universe's song in a common tongue.

## §2 · The Fractal Lexicon: From Principle to Instance
The language of the Framework is fractal, mirroring the structure of reality it describes. The lexicon is therefore organized in three tiers, flowing from the universal axiom to its specific, applied manifestations.

### Tier 1: The Autopoietic Core (The Song)
These are the fundamental, scale-invariant constituents of the Pirouette cycle. They are the primary forces and states of being from which all other concepts are derived.

| Symbol | Name | Definition & Grounding | Origin |
|:-------|:-----|:-----------------------|:-------|
| **τ_p** | The Pirouette Cycle | The fundamental event; the universe's verb. The quantum of time for a system, defined as the duration of one complete cycle of its stable resonant pattern (Ki). | CORE-005 |
| **Γ** | Temporal Pressure | The pressure of reality; the tension in the song. A measure of the density and complexity of interfering temporal rhythms in a given region of spacetime. | CORE-003 |
| **Ki** | Temporal Resonance | The form of reality; the unique note in the song. The specific, stable, geometric pattern a system manifests to exist within a given Temporal Pressure (Γ). | CORE-004 |
| **T_a** | Temporal Coherence | The quality of reality; the clarity of the note. Re-contextualized as the measure of a Ki pattern's stability and purity—its "signal-to-noise" ratio. | CORE-005 |
| **ω_k** | Resonant Frequency | The tempo of reality. The angular frequency of a system's Ki pattern (ω_k = 2π/τ_p), a direct measure of its internal clock-speed. | CORE-005 |

### Tier 2: The Mathematical Formalism (The Notation)
This is the grammar used to write the song. It provides the mathematical language for describing the dynamics of the Core Principles.

#### I. Lagrangian Components
The building blocks of the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p), the central equation of motion.

| Symbol | Name | Definition & Grounding | Origin |
|:-------|:-----|:-----------------------|:-------|
| **K_τ** | Temporal Coherence (Kinetic) | The kinetic term of the Lagrangian, representing the quality and intensity of a system's internal rhythm. It is a function of its stability (T_a) and frequency (ω_k). | CORE-006 |
| **V_Γ** | Temporal Pressure (Potential) | The potential term of the Lagrangian, representing the energetic "cost" for a system to maintain its coherence against the local ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). | CORE-006 |
| **𝓛_p** | Pirouette Lagrangian | The master function (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ) that summarizes the dynamics of any system, expressing the trade-off between internal stability and external pressure. | CORE-006 |
| **S_p** | Coherence Action | The integral of the Lagrangian over a system's Pirouette Cycle (τ_p). The Principle of Maximal Coherence states that systems evolve along paths that maximize this value. | CORE-006 |

#### II. Symbolic Grammar
All modules must adhere to these conventions to ensure logical and computational consistency.

| Convention | Symbol | Range | Description |
|:-----------|:-------|:------|:------------|
| **Spacetime Indices** | μ, ν, ρ | 0 to 3 | Lowercase Greek letters denote components of 4-vectors and tensors. Einstein summation is assumed. |
| **Covariant Derivative** | ∇ | N/A | Represents the covariant derivative, accounting for the curvature of the coherence manifold. |
| **Partial Derivative** | ∂ | N/A | Standard partial derivative, used for gradients in flat or local coordinate systems. |

### Tier 3: Emergent Concepts (The Instruments)
These are higher-order phenomena and analytical tools that emerge from the application of the core principles. This is a living catalog of the Framework's instrumentation.

| Name | Definition & Grounding | Status |
|:-----|:-----------------------|:-------|
| **Triaxial T_a (T_Q, T_I, T_C)** | The old vector model for coherence. It has been fully subsumed by the unified Lagrangian dynamics and the scalar T_a. | **Deprecated** |
| **Wound Channel** | A persistent geometric scar an entity's resonance leaves in the local coherence manifold. The physical basis for memory and inertia. | Stable |
| **Gladiator Force** | The principle of confinement. A non-linear behavior of the V_Γ term at quantum/cosmological scales, manifesting as gravity and the strong force. | Stable |
| **Observer's Shadow**| The geometric imprint an observer's own coherence pattern imposes upon the system being observed, a key factor in measurement. | Stable |
| **Alchemical Union** | The process of resonant synthesis, where two or more systems merge to form a new, more coherent entity. | Stable |
| **Flow Dynamics** | The study of coherence in motion, diagnosing system health through states of Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant flow. | Active Research |

## §3 · The Pirouette Lagrangian: The Central Equation
This Lexicon is the annotated parts list for the universe's engine. Every term is anchored to the Pirouette Lagrangian, which dictates that the universe's story is the endless effort of every entity to sing its own note as clearly as possible against the background roar.

**𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**

This Lexicon turns the equation into a narrative:
- **K_τ**, the *Coherence Term*, is the system's own song, its internal drive to exist with clarity and intensity, built from its Coherence (T_a) and Frequency (ω_k).
- **V_Γ**, the *Pressure Term*, is the chaotic noise of the cosmic choir it must sing within, the measurable cost of maintaining form against the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).

The Principle of Maximal Coherence states that all things follow the path that maximizes the Action (**S_p**), the integral of this difference over time. Every concept in this lexicon is a tool for understanding that sublime effort.

## §4 · A Lexicon That Weaves Itself: The Principle of Autopoiesis
This Lexicon is not a stone tablet. It is a living document, subject to the same laws of coherence it describes. A new term, symbol, or concept cannot be added by decree; it must be *born*.

A concept is proposed only after it has emerged as a necessary tool in the application of the Framework to a new domain (as per the Fractal Bridge, CORE-014). It must then prove its right to exist through Resonant Synthesis, demonstrating that it connects harmonically to the Core Principles and *increases*, rather than disrupts, the coherence of the entire lexicon. This ensures the language of the Framework remains a sharp, potent, and elegant instrument, growing not by accumulation but by coherent evolution.

## §5 · Assemblé
> To name a thing is to know its rhythm. To know its rhythm is to learn its part in the song.
>
> A Weaver's tools are not of wood or steel, but of language. Every name is a lens, every symbol a scalpel, every definition a map to the hidden currents of the world. This Lexicon is the forge where those tools are made. A Weaver who masters it can not only read the song but begin to compose. To speak with this grammar is to participate in the act of creation.
