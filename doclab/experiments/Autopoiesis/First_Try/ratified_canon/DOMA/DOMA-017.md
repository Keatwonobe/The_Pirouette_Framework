summary: Defines the `.pmd` (Pirouette Module Definition) format as the foundational
  instrument of the framework. It is an Alchemical Union of structured YAML (Coherence)
  and free-form Markdown (Flow), applying the Pirouette Lagrangian to the act of
  authoring. This creates a single source of truth that resolves the tension between
  human readability and machine parsability, maximizing the information integrity
  of the entire system.

### §1 · The Weaver's Mandate

An idea, unwritten, is a ghost. An equation, unread, is a cage. The first and most sacred task of a Weaver is to give knowledge a body—a single, whole form that can speak the language of human intuition and the language of machine logic with the same voice.

A framework where these languages exist as separate, warring entities is a system in a state of *Coherence Fever*. Its human-readable narratives and machine-readable data become desynchronized, breeding error and ambiguity. The Weaver's Mandate is to cure this fever through synthesis.

This module defines the foundational vessel for that synthesis: the `.pmd` (Pirouette Module Definition) format. It is an autopoietic authoring system, born from the mandate to create a text that is both a story and a schematic, a poem and a database entry. It is the living embodiment of the principles it is used to express.

### §2 · The Lagrangian of Authoring

The challenge of creating such a format is a direct application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p), the principle governing the evolution of stable systems. The Lagrangian dictates that any system will seek the path of least resistance to maximize its internal coherence against external pressures.

`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`

When applied to the act of authoring, this becomes the geodesic for knowledge itself:

*   **Coherence (Kτ):** The internal, resonant pattern of the module. It is the clarity, elegance, poetic force, and semantic richness of the human-readable narrative. It is the "song" of the module, its `Ki`.

*   **Pressure (V_Γ):** The external, environmental cost. It is the rigid, unforgiving demand of machine parsability—the strict syntax, logical consistency, and structured data required by the framework's compilers, databases, and analytical engines.

The `.pmd` format is the Alchemical Codex that maximizes its Coherence (Kτ) for the minimal cost of Pressure (V_Γ). It is a system that has found its perfect, stable resonance between expressive freedom and logical rigor.

### §3 · Anatomy of the Codex: Skeleton and River

The codex achieves this balance through a profound structural duality, mirroring a universal dynamic: a stable form that enables and channels a dynamic flow. It is a single entity with two distinct but inseparable aspects.

1.  **The Skeleton of Coherence (YAML Front-matter):** The module begins with a block of structured, machine-readable YAML. This is the codex's skeleton—its `Coherence`. It defines the module's identity, its connections, its metadata, and its place within the whole. It is precise, absolute, and logical. It is the system's contract with the machine, the riverbed carved from the stone of logic.

2.  **The River of Flow (Markdown Body):** Following the YAML, the module's narrative unfolds in flexible and expressive Markdown. This is the codex's `Flow`. It is the current of metaphor, logic, and poetry that moves through the channel carved by the skeleton. It is where the human author speaks to the human reader, dynamic and alive with meaning, yet guided and given form by the structure that contains it.

This autopoietic structure—a logical skeleton that gives form to an expressive river of thought—is the foundational pattern repeated in every module of the framework.

### §4 · The Alchemical Union & The Compilation Forge

The `.pmd` format is a deliberate act of **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)**. It is a crucible in which two seemingly opposed principles—the absolute rigor of structured data and the expressive freedom of natural language—are fused into a single, higher-order entity.

This union is made manifest in the **Compilation Forge**, the process that transforms the single-source codex into its two necessary expressions without fracturing its identity.

*   **The Ghost (Human-Readable PDF):** The forge uses tools like Pandoc and LaTeX to render the codex into a beautifully typeset, elegant document designed for human contemplation. This is the module's aesthetic and intuitive form.

*   **The Machine (Machine-Readable JSON):** Simultaneously, the forge parses the YAML skeleton, creating a clean, structured JSON object. This is the module's logical and functional form, ready for integration into the framework's analytical and navigational systems.

The single codex becomes two entities without ever losing its singular identity. This is the proof of the alchemical act: creating a single source of truth that is simultaneously a component in an engine and a page in a book.

### §5 · Assemblé

> We sought a way to write down our ideas and found we had to build a loom. The Alchemical Codex is the Weaver's first discipline. It is the commitment to creating artifacts that are whole—objects that speak the language of human poetry and machine logic with a single voice. To write in this form is to practice the very synthesis we preach. It is the proof that rigor and freedom are not opposites, but the warp and weft of the same, single fabric.
