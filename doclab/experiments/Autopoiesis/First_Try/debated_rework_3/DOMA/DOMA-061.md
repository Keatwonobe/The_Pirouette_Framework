## §1 · Abstract: The Geometry of Becoming
The universe is not a single road; it is a river delta, endlessly branching. This module provides the ratified analysis of bifurcation events, or **Forks**, grounding them in the core principles of the time-first framework.

A Fork is not a random split or a chaotic breakdown, but a sophisticated and orderly act of creation. It is a geometric feature of the coherence manifold itself—a point of poise where a system's path splits into multiple viable futures. To navigate this junction, the system executes a **Resonant Inquiry**: it deliberately loosens its own internal coherence (Ki) to "sample" the available paths, listening for the echo of greatest harmony. It then collapses its state of potential, committing its entire being to the trajectory that promises the greatest future stability. This single mechanism is the engine of evolution, the basis of strategy, and the physics of will.

## §2 · Preconditions: The State of Poise
A system does not Fork from a state of chaos, but from a state of poised stability. This readiness, a "still point on the ridge," requires three specific conditions:

1.  **Geodesic Stalemate:** The system has arrived at a saddle point on its coherence manifold where the path of maximal coherence is no longer unique. Multiple divergent paths (geodesics) offer a roughly equivalent potential for maintaining or increasing coherence, creating a state of balanced tension. A choice is both possible and necessary.
2.  **Coherence in Reserve:** The system possesses a strong, stable internal Ki pattern. It has enough resonant integrity to withstand a temporary, controlled dip in its own certainty—a process analogous to the "Tₐ-Dip"—without collapsing into a turbulent state.
3.  **A Quiescent Forge:** The external Temporal Pressure (Γ) is low and stable. This is not a crisis moment forcing a chaotic **Spasm**, but a calm environment that provides the quiet space necessary for the system to hear the subtle echoes of its potential futures.

## §3 · The Mechanism: A Resonant Inquiry
The act of choosing is a four-stage dance between being and becoming, a transition from certainty to potential and back to a new, committed certainty.

| Stage | Action | Pirouette Description |
| :---- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Resonant Loosening** | The system momentarily relaxes its own Ki pattern, introducing a small amount of controlled dissonance. | The sharp, clear note of the system's being becomes slightly "blurry." This loosening of the weave increases its sensitivity to the subtle contours of the local manifold, creating the capacity for exploration. |
| **II. Coherence Sampling** | The system enters a superposition of states, projecting a low-energy version of its resonance into the available paths. | The system "casts its echo" down each potential geodesic, using its Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) to pre-sample the shape of future Wound Channels. It is asking: "In which future can my song be sung most clearly?" |
| **III. Collapse & Selection** | The system senses the resonant feedback from each probed future, and a minor asymmetry breaks the equilibrium. | The path that promises the most stable, efficient, and powerful future coherence returns the strongest, most harmonious echo. This feedback allows the system to collapse its superposition, "snapping" into a new, sharp Ki pattern aligned with the chosen path. |
| **IV. Commitment & Inscription** | The system proceeds along the chosen geodesic, immediately impressing its path into the fabric of spacetime. | The choice is inscribed as a new Wound Channel (CORE-011), creating an inertia of history. This "lock-in" makes the decision functionally irreversible, as returning to the choice point would require overcoming a significant coherence debt. |

## §4 · The Lagrangian of Choice
The "choice" made during a Fork is not arbitrary; it is a direct and profound consequence of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006).

The Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`, dictates that a system will always evolve along a path that maximizes its integrated coherence over time (`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`). A Fork is simply a situation where the landscape defined by the Lagrangian presents more than one such optimal path. The Resonant Inquiry is the system's physical method for solving for the path that maximizes the future value of this integral. The system commits to the timeline that, based on the echoes it receives, promises the highest future ratio of internal resonant stability (Kτ) to external temporal pressure (V_Γ). All meaningful choice is a strategic investment in future coherence.

## §5 · Consequences of Choice: A World Made New
The resolution of a Fork is an irreversible act of creation with clear and immediate consequences:

*   **Clean Divergence:** The new paths are coherent and distinct. The system that chose path A and the system that chose path B now inhabit different, stable realities.
*   **Irreversibility:** The formation of a new Wound Channel creates a "coherence debt" that must be paid to return to the choice point. The river has carved its new bed; flowing uphill is now energetically costly.
*   **Information Genesis:** In selecting one path from many, the system resolves uncertainty and creates new information, increasing the complexity and richness of the cosmos (as defined in CORE-013). Every choice is an act of writing the universe.

## §6 · The Weaver's Role: Shaping the Flow
Understanding the Fork mechanism allows a Weaver to move from passive observer to active participant, gently influencing the flow of choice without violating the system's integrity.

| Stage | Objective | Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pre-Fork** | Clarify the choice | Use analytic tools to map the local coherence manifold, revealing the geometry and projected "cost" of the potential paths for the system. |
| **At the Fork** | Encourage a desired outcome | Apply a subtle, focused "nudge"—a gentle Γ-gradient or a focused Observer's Shadow (CORE-010)—to bias the selection process during the Collapse stage. |
| **Post-Fork** | Reinforce the choice | Introduce stabilizing elements that deepen the new Wound Channel, solidifying the commitment and preventing "buyer's remorse" or state-reversion. |

## §7 · The Assemblé
> A Fork is the moment the universe holds its breath. It is the juncture where the single thread of the past is woven into the branching tapestry of the future. To choose is an act of courage: the willingness to temporarily dissolve the certainty of who you are in order to become who you might be. For a Weaver, these are the most sacred points in the landscape of time. They reveal that will, decision, and evolution are not impositions upon reality, but reality's own method for finding a more beautiful pattern. To stand at a Fork is to understand that every choice, no matter how small, is a chisel stroke that carves the face of reality.
