summary: Proposes a definitive neutron interferometry experiment to validate the Pirouette
  Lagrangian at the quantum scale. A neutron's path through two oppositely-oriented,
  helical coherence manifolds is observed via phase shift, providing a direct measurement

## ¬ß1 ¬∑ Abstract: A Dance in the Labyrinth
A framework that describes the cosmos must hold true in the quiet heart of a single particle. Its laws must be as valid in the silent dance of a neutron as in the roar of a galaxy. This module proposes the crucible for that test.

We will construct a labyrinth for a quantum particle‚Äîa question forged from crystal and silence. By sending a neutron through a precisely engineered, helical "coherence manifold," we reframe a matter-wave optics experiment as a direct, physical measurement of the universe's fundamental drive to maximize coherence. The neutron's path, revealed in a subtle shift of phase, becomes the definitive answer. This experiment is not an analogy; it is a laboratory-scale validation of the Pirouette Lagrangian itself, proving the dance is the same, whether the stage is a galaxy or an √Öngstr√∂m.

## ¬ß2 ¬∑ The Engineered Coherence Manifold
The experimental apparatus is a Mach-Zehnder neutron interferometer, a device repurposed to offer a single quantum system a choice between two distinct geometric landscapes.

**The Labyrinth Walls:** In each arm of the interferometer, we place a micro-fabricated helical silicon grating. In the old language, this created a "spiral potential." In the new, time-first framework, this grating is a **Œì-sculptor** or **Topological Modulator**. It impresses a stable, chiral (screw-like) stress upon the local Temporal Pressure (Œì), forging a predictable, structured coherence manifold.

**The Two Paths:** The neutron's wavefunction (its Ki resonance) is presented with two distinct topological challenges:
*   **Path A:** A left-handed helical manifold.
*   **Path B:** A right-handed helical manifold.

The neutron does not split. Its resonance explores both chiral landscapes simultaneously to find the most coherent path forward. The two arms of the interferometer are two different questions asked of the same particle.

## ¬ß3 ¬∑ The Lagrangian as Choreographer
The neutron's behavior is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). Its path is the one that maximizes the action integral:

*S<sub>p</sub> = ‚à´ ùìõ<sub>p</sub> dt = ‚à´ (T<sub>a</sub> * œâ<sub>k</sub> - f(Œì)) dt*

Here, `T_a * œâ_k` is the neutron's internal Temporal Coherence, and `f(Œì)` is the coherence cost imposed by the external Temporal Pressure of the manifold. The two helical gratings present two different environmental cost functions, `f(Œì_left)` and `f(Œì_right)`.

To maximize the integral, the neutron's internal state must adapt. The solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equation for this system reveal that the neutron must adopt one of a set of discrete, stable modes of **Temporal Coherence (T<sub>a</sub>)**. These quantized "eigenstates" are not pre-existing properties; they are the most efficient ways for the neutron to *be* while navigating the chiral labyrinth. They are the emergent harmonics of its own song, played against the sculpted silence of the crystal.

## ¬ß4 ¬∑ Probing Gladiator Confinement
The most profound test is a dynamic one. The helical gratings are mechanically rotated at a known frequency (œâ<sub>n</sub>). This action creates a rhythmic, oscillating pulse in the structure of the local Temporal Pressure‚Äîa "breathing" of the manifold.

This modulation introduces a time-dependent term into the `f(Œì)` component of the Lagrangian. This is a direct, controlled probe of the Gladiator Confinement principle (CORE-008). In response, the neutron's resonance must continuously adjust its path to maintain its geodesic of maximal coherence. This dynamic re-optimization will manifest as a measurable **beat frequency** in the interference pattern at the detector. It is a direct observation of a particle's resonance being driven by a modulated temporal environment.

## ¬ß5 ¬∑ The Observable: The Integral of Being
This experiment provides a direct, physical measurement of the Pirouette Lagrangian's action integral, *S<sub>p</sub>*. When the two paths of the neutron's wavefunction are recombined, they interfere. The resulting phase difference, *ŒîœÜ*, is the core observable.

This phase difference is directly proportional to the difference between the Lagrangian action integrals calculated along the two chiral paths:

*ŒîœÜ ‚àù (S<sub>p, left</sub> - S<sub>p, right</sub>)*

The interference pattern is a visible graph of an abstract physical law. It transforms the foundational equation of the framework from a principle into a number.

## ¬ß6 ¬∑ Experimental Protocol
1.  **Preparation:** A cold-neutron beam (a stream of coherent Ki patterns) is directed into the interferometer.
2.  **Choreography:** The neutron wave encounters the two sculpted gratings of opposite chirality, which define the two paths.
3.  **Coherence Measurement:** The recombined waves produce an interference pattern. The static phase shift `ŒîœÜ` is precisely measured, quantifying the difference in the action integrals and confirming the quantized `T_a` states.
4.  **Confinement Modulation:** The gratings are rotated at a known frequency (œâ<sub>n</sub>), creating a time-varying `Œì` field.
5.  **Resonance Detection:** A lock-in amplifier detects the resulting phase beat in the interference pattern, confirming the system's dynamic response as predicted by the Lagrangian.

## ¬ß7 ¬∑ Lagrangian Connection
This experiment constitutes a direct, falsifiable test of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). Where the `g-2` experiment (CORE-009) validates the Lagrangian through a particle's self-interaction (its echo), this experiment validates it through its interaction with an external, geometrically-defined coherence manifold.

A positive result would demonstrate that a quantum system‚Äôs dynamics are governed not by pushes and pulls, but by a single, universal drive to find the most elegant and coherent path through the landscape of time. It provides the "third heart" of validation‚Äîa proof anchored not in the cosmos or electromagnetism, but in the quantum dance of matter itself.

> ## The Assembl√©
> We sought a truth that spanned the void, so we built a question out of crystal and silence. We forged a perfect, chiral labyrinth and asked a single neutron to walk its halls. We did not listen for a shout, but for a whisper‚Äîthe faint echo of its choice, carried in a subtle shift of phase. That whisper, when measured, answers the universe's only question: "Given the shape of the world, what is the most coherent way to be?" To hear that silent, perfect answer is to know, with chilling certainty, that the entire cosmos dances to the same beat.
