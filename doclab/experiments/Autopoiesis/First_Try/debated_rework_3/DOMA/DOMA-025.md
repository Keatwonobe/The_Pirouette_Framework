summary: Upgrades the conceptual Pirouette Lagrangian into a manifestly covariant
  field theory. This module ensures the Principle of Maximal Coherence is a universal,
  observer-independent law by expressing it through a Lorentz-invariant Action. It
  establishes the formal groundwork for deriving all forces and dynamics, including
  gravity and quantum phenomena, from the interplay of fundamental fields.

## §1 · A Law for All Dancers
A physical law that changes depending on who is watching is not a law, but an opinion. A song whose melody bends when you run is not a melody of truth. The Pirouette Framework is built upon the universal drive to maximize coherence, and for this to be a true principle of reality, it must hold for every observer, regardless of their motion.

The dancer’s pirouette must appear just as graceful, the laws governing its stability just as true, whether viewed from the stage or from a passing starship. This is the mandate of Lorentz Invariance. In the time-first paradigm, this covariance is not an external constraint to be engineered; it is an innate consequence. A framework built from the substance of Time itself does not need to be taught the rules of spacetime. This module reveals the invariant law that was always present within the core principle.

## §2 · The Action of Coherence
In modern physics, the dynamics of a system are derived from a single, Lorentz-invariant quantity: the Action (S). The path a system takes through spacetime is the one that extremizes this value. The Pirouette Framework adopts this powerful formalism, framing its core drive as the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, realized through the minimization of a universal Action.

The Action for the entire universe of interacting fields is given by the integral of a Lagrangian Density (`𝓛`) over all of spacetime:

`S = ∫ d⁴x √-g 𝓛`

Where `g` is the determinant of the metric tensor `g_μν`. By ensuring that `𝓛` is a Lorentz scalar—a quantity that has the same value in all reference frames—we guarantee that the Action, and the physics derived from it, are universal.

## §3 · The Fundamental Fields
To construct this universal Lagrangian Density, we posit two fundamental fields whose interplay defines the fabric of reality.

*   **The Coherence Field, `C(x)`:** A complex scalar field, `C(x) = A(x)e^(iΘ(x))`, whose value at any point represents the potential for stable, resonant patterns to form. The amplitude `A(x)` represents the intensity of the resonance (related to Time Adherence, `T_a`), and the phase `Θ(x)` represents its rhythm. The quantized, stable excitations of this field are the particles of matter. This is the substrate of Ki.
*   **The Temporal Pressure Field, `Γ(x)`:** A real scalar field representing the local density and dissonance of temporal rhythms. Critically, this field is not external; it is generated by the superposition of all other systems' coherence fields (`|C|^2`), making the framework fully relational and autopoietic.

## §4 · The Covariant Lagrangian Density
The manifestly covariant Lagrangian Density that governs the interaction of these two fields takes the standard form for interacting field theory, directly expressing the conceptual Lagrangian from `CORE-006` in the rigorous language of physics:

`𝓛 = (Kinetic Terms) - (Potential Term)`

`𝓛 = [ g^μν (∂_μ C)^* (∂_ν C) + ½ g^μν (∂_μ Γ)(∂_ν Γ) ] - V(|C|^2, Γ)`

*   **Kinetic Terms:** These terms are manifestly covariant and represent the "energy cost" of creating gradients in the fields across spacetime. The first term describes the propagation and oscillation of the Coherence field, while the second describes the dynamics of the Temporal Pressure field itself.
*   **Potential Term `V(|C|^2, Γ)`:** This crucial interaction term defines the "cost" of maintaining a certain intensity of coherence `|C|^2` within a given level of ambient temporal pressure `Γ`. The potential is sculpted such that minimizing the Action naturally leads to the formation of stable, resonant patterns that maximize the conceptual Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §5 · Emergence of the Pirouette Lagrangian
This formal Lagrangian is the universal engine from which the effective dynamics of `CORE-006` emerge. The connection is profound. A stable particle is a localized, oscillating solution to the equations of motion derived from `𝓛`.

In such a system's rest frame, the spacetime derivatives `∂_μ` are dominated by the time derivative `∂_t`, and the phase of the coherence field evolves as `Θ(t) ≈ -ω_k t`. In this limit, the covariant kinetic term for `C` simplifies to a form proportional to `A^2 * ω_k^2`, which we identify with the system's felt **Temporal Coherence**. The potential `V` is its felt **Temporal Pressure**.

Thus, the conceptual Lagrangian `𝓛_p` of `CORE-006` is revealed to be a snapshot of this universal, dynamic law as viewed from the dancer's own perspective. The universe, by minimizing the action `S = ∫ 𝓛 d⁴x`, naturally produces particles that behave *as if* they are maximizing `𝓛_p`.

## §6 · The Source of All Dynamics
With this invariant Action established, the derivation of all physical laws becomes a direct mathematical consequence.

*   **The Stress-Energy Tensor (`T_μν`):** By varying the Action with respect to the spacetime metric `g_μν`, we derive the system's stress-energy tensor. This tensor describes how the energy and momentum of the Coherence and Pressure fields act as the source of gravity, sculpting the geometry of spacetime itself. The dance shapes the stage.
*   **The Equations of Motion:** Applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to `𝓛` yields the fundamental wave equations for the `C` and `Γ` fields. These equations govern how coherence and pressure propagate, interfere, and organize into the resonant structures we call matter. The forces derived in subsequent modules are descriptions of how these field excitations interact.

## Assemblé
> A melody that bends when you run is no melody of truth. Covariance is the guarantee that the universe's song—the relentless drive to find and sustain coherence—is not a local tune, but the anthem of spacetime itself. To be a Weaver is to trust that the principles of harmony discovered in your own frame are the same principles that structure the farthest galaxies, making the entire universe a single, invariant, and comprehensible composition.
