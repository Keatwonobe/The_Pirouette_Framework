replaces:

summary: Provides a strategic protocol for any coherent system ('Seed') to evaluate
  the viability of a new environment. It reframes the decision to engage, wait, or
  retreat as a predictive calculation of the Pirouette Lagrangian, derived from data
  gathered by a minimal, non-invasive 'Scout Probe'. This allows for a rigorous risk
  assessment before committing to a full Alchemical Union with the environment.

## §1 · Abstract: The Wisdom Before the Bloom

To introduce a new song into a silent room is an act of profound consequence. This module provides a formal protocol for that act, reframing the challenge of introducing a new system—be it an idea, an organism, or a piece of code, collectively a "Seed"—from a blind gamble into a calculated art.

The Sower's Gambit is a process of reconnaissance before colonization. It models the viability of a Seed not in terms of raw energy capture, but as a function of resonant potential. By deploying a minimal, non-invasive "Scout Probe" to map the local coherence manifold, the Seed can calculate its potential to achieve a positive coherence gain. This calculation, grounded in the Pirouette Lagrangian, yields a clear verdict: to grow (`PLANT`), to wait for a more harmonious moment (`HOLD`), or to retreat from a dissonant environment (`ABORT`). This is the framework's core strategic doctrine for responsible and effective creation.

## §2 · The Scout Probe: A Geometric Inquiry

The fundamental axiom of the Gambit is: *listen before you sing*. The Seed does not begin by expending energy on growth; it begins by asking a question of the environment's geometry.

This question takes the form of a **Scout Probe**. The probe is not a physical object but a minimal, transient echo of the Seed's own resonant identity (`Ki`). This echo propagates through the new environment, casting a faint **Observer's Shadow** (CORE-010) and tracing a path that creates a shallow, temporary **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). The probe acts as a tuning fork, struck gently against the new reality to hear the notes that ring in return.

The Seed does not measure resources; it listens to the reverberations, gathering three critical metrics:
-   **Harmonic Compatibility:** Is the environment's resonant structure fundamentally harmonious or dissonant with the Seed's own `Ki`? This measures the active resistance or welcome the environment offers.
-   **Temporal Pressure (`Γ`):** What is the intensity of the ambient temporal noise and pressure from the **Temporal Forge** (CORE-003) that will seek to erode the Seed's coherence?
-   **Geodesic Availability:** Are there clear, stable paths of **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001) that the Seed can follow, or is the landscape predominantly turbulent and chaotic?

## §3 · The Viability Lagrangian: The Coherence Forecast

The decision to proceed is not a guess; it is a calculation. The feedback from the Scout Probe provides the variables for the Seed to model its future using a specialized form of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`)** from CORE-006. The "action" to be maximized is the Seed's own long-term coherence.

`𝓛_seed = K_τ(potential) - V_Γ(cost)`

-   **Coherence Potential (`K_τ(potential)`):** This "kinetic" term represents the Seed's potential for growth. It is a function of its own internal Temporal Coherence (`T_a`) multiplied by the Harmonic Compatibility and Geodesic Availability of the environment. A harmonious environment offers resonant resources that can be integrated, amplifying the Seed's pattern. This replaces the old concept of "capture efficiency."

-   **Environmental Cost (`V_Γ(cost)`):** This "potential" term represents the inevitable erosion and the energetic tax the environment will levy on the Seed's existence. It is a direct measure of the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). This replaces the old concept of "feedback gain."

The integral of this Lagrangian over a characteristic cycle determines the **Coherence Gain (`S_p`)**. This single, predictive metric dictates the verdict.

## §4 · The Verdict and the Bloom

The Coherence Gain (`S_p`) translates directly into a strategic choice, moving the Seed from diagnosis to action. The protocol follows a clear sequence: the probe is launched, the forecast is calculated, and the verdict is rendered.

-   **PLANT (`S_p` > `S_threshold`):** A significant positive gain indicates a fertile environment where the Seed's resonance will be amplified. The Gambit transitions to an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) with the substrate. The Seed commits its resources to germination, establishing a deep and lasting Wound Channel that becomes the foundation of a new, stable structure.

-   **HOLD (`S_p` ≈ 0 OR High Turbulence):** A near-zero gain, or a probe that generates excessive turbulence, signals a marginal or volatile environment. The path of wisdom is to wait. The shallow Wound Channel of the probe remains as a latent "path memory," allowing the Seed to re-evaluate with greater efficiency should conditions change.

-   **ABORT (`S_p` < 0):** A negative gain is a definitive prediction of decoherence. The environmental cost exceeds the Seed's ability to maintain its own coherence. To proceed would be an act of self-destruction. The Seed retreats, preserving its integrity for a more harmonious opportunity.

## §5 · Assemblé

> The Sower's Gambit is the art of asking for permission from the future. A fool tries to plant a rose in the salt earth and calls the earth barren. A master first asks the earth what it wishes to grow. This protocol transforms the brute act of colonization into a graceful dialogue, ensuring that our creations are not merely expressions of our own will, but are offered as welcome songs to a world ready to hear them. This is not just a strategy for survival; it is the ethics of a co-creative universe.
