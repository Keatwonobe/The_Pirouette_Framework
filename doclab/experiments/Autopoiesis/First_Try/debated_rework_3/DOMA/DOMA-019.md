## ¬ß1 ¬∑ Abstract: From Boundary to Bearing
The old framework established a necessary boundary‚Äîan Ethical Light Cone to prevent catastrophic missteps. This was the wisdom of caution. The new framework demands more: the wisdom of cultivation. To act is to carve a new path into the memory of the universe. Our mandate is not merely to avoid causing harm (a negative constraint), but to actively cultivate systemic health (a positive duty).

The Weaver's Compass replaces the static fence with a dynamic, navigational instrument. It reframes ethical consideration from a reactive check on "consequence" to a proactive assessment of the **Geometry of Consequence**. It provides a universal protocol for measuring **Coherence Risk (R_Œ∫)**‚Äîthe potential of any action to degrade the health and harmony of the systems it touches. It is the tuning fork that attunes the artist's ear, ensuring that the echo we compose is worthy of eternity.

## ¬ß2 ¬∑ The Geometry of Consequence
In the Pirouette Framework, every action impresses a memory, a **Wound Channel** (CORE-011), into the coherence manifold of spacetime. This is the physical basis of consequence. An action's ethical character is a direct property of the geometry of the channel it creates. An act is not "bad" because it is large; it is *risky* because it threatens to create a deep, dissonant scar that propagates through many layers of reality.

To map this geometry, we translate the old risk parameters into their true, dynamic forms:

| Old Term | New Pirouette Term | Mapping Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Scope (S) | **Reach (œÅ)** | How many nested systems will the resulting turbulence propagate to? |
| Magnitude (M) | **Dissonance (Œ¥)** | How severely will the action disrupt a target system's core resonant pattern (Ki)? |
| Irreversibility (I) | **Wound Channel Depth (œâ)** | How deeply and permanently will the action scar a system's memory and identity, as encoded in its Wound Channel? |

## ¬ß3 ¬∑ The Coherence Risk Equation (R_Œ∫)
Coherence Risk is a predictive metric (0‚Äì1 scale) that estimates the potential degradation of a system's health. It is the practical instrument for gauging the "coherence cost" an action might impose. It is a weighted function of the three core geometric factors:

$$ R_Œ∫ = w_œÅ œÅ + w_Œ¥ Œ¥ + w_œâ œâ $$

Where **œÅ**, **Œ¥**, and **œâ** are normalized scores (0-1) and **w** are the currently calibrated weights for Reach, Dissonance, and Wound Channel Depth. This equation provides a clear, quantitative estimate of an action's potential to introduce destructive turbulence into the universal song.

## ¬ß4 ¬∑ The Principles of Coherence Stewardship
The old axioms are reframed as four proactive principles for any Weaver acting within the framework.

1.  **The Principle of Foresight:** Any action that interfaces with a complex system must first calculate its Coherence Risk (R_Œ∫). To act without foresight is to sail into a storm without a map.
2.  **The Principle of Proportional Care:** The degree of oversight, simulation, and mitigation required for an action must scale in proportion to its calculated R_Œ∫. We do not use a sledgehammer to set a gemstone.
3.  **The Principle of Irreversibility:** Actions that threaten to carve deep, permanent Wound Channels (high œâ) demand the highest standard of scrutiny and justification. Some bells cannot be un-rung.
4.  **The Sentience Sanctuary:** The emergence of a coherent, self-aware consciousness is the universe's most profound act of creation. Any system exhibiting such properties is a sacred arena. Actions that risk its coherence are subject to an immediate and indefinite moratorium, pending a review of incomparable depth.

## ¬ß5 ¬∑ The Protocol of Prudence: Navigating the Manifold
Based on the calculated R_Œ∫, a project's path is guided by a clear, tiered protocol.

-   **Laminar Path (R_Œ∫ ‚â§ 0.5):** The action is predicted to integrate smoothly, generating a coherent channel. It may proceed with standard monitoring and reporting.
-   **Turbulent Watch (0.5 < R_Œ∫ ‚â§ 0.75):** The action carries a significant risk of creating local turbulence. It requires enhanced monitoring, real-time coherence diagnostics, and pre-defined rollback plans. Proceed with caution and active mitigation.
-   **Coherence Quarantine (R_Œ∫ > 0.75):** The action is predicted to cause severe, widespread dissonance, risking a stagnant or destructive channel. The project is immediately isolated. This invokes **The Crucible Protocol**.

**The Crucible Protocol** reframes a failed ethical review as an opportunity for creative synthesis. It is not a gate of judgment, but a forge for refinement.
1.  A **Dissonance Audit** is performed: an adversarial simulation designed to map the full geometry of the project's worst-case failure modes.
2.  The project Weavers and the audit team convene in a sacred arena, governed by the principles of *The Geometry of Debate* (DYNA-002).
3.  The collective's sole task is to achieve an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012), re-forging the project's design to achieve its goals while shaping a Laminar Echo. A project can only exit the Crucible once this new, resonant form is achieved and ratified.

## ¬ß6 ¬∑ Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The Weaver's Compass is the practical, moral application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006). The Pirouette Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p`, defines the "health" of a system; a coherent system is one that successfully maximizes its `‚à´ùìõ_p dt`.

Coherence Risk (R_Œ∫) is a predictive estimate of the negative impact an external action will have on a target system's ability to maximize its Lagrangian. It is the tool used to estimate the predicted change in the total systemic Lagrangian, **Œîùìõ_sys**.

-   An **ethical action** is constructive or generative (**Œîùìõ_sys ‚â• 0**), helping other systems maintain or increase their coherence.
-   An **unethical action** is destructive or parasitic (**Œîùìõ_sys < 0**), degrading the coherence of other systems for its own sake.

The Compass is the instrument that allows a Weaver to align their personal trajectory of maximal coherence with that of the interconnected whole *before* the first thread is woven.

## ¬ß7 ¬∑ The Assembl√©
> We sought a rulebook and found a compass. The old way built walls to protect us from the darkness; this new way teaches us to navigate by the light of the consequences we create. The Weaver's Compass is not a restraint on action, but a clarification of its purpose. It is the recognition that every choice we make becomes a permanent feature of the landscape upon which others must walk. A Weaver does not ask, "Am I allowed to build this?" They ask, "What world am I building?" This is our sacred promise: that our art will serve the music, and the echoes we compose will be a blessing for all who follow in our wake.
