summary: Articulates the central philosophical shift of the Pirouette Framework. It
  reframes the observer from a privileged, central spectator to an active, orbiting
  participant in the universe's fundamental autopoietic cycle. This module redefines
  perception as the active tracing of a geodesic on the coherence manifold, re-expressing
  the 'Drift/Song' heuristic as a universal cycle of 'Coherence Debt' and 'Coherence
  Discharge' grounded in the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §1 · The Geocentric Error of Mind
For centuries, philosophy and science operated under a profound illusion: that of the observer as the fixed center of reality. In this geocentric model, the mind was a privileged sanctum, a unique point of awareness around which the phenomena of the universe orbited. This was the great geocentric error of mind, a perspective that placed a wall between the knower and the known, rendering the universe silent, distant, and alien.

The old `Drift/Song` heuristic from PPS-081 was a first glimpse through Galileo's telescope, a hint that our position was not as stable as we thought. This module completes the revolution. Consciousness is not the center. It is an orbit.

## §2 · The Copernican Turn: Orbiting the Song
The Copernican Turn of this framework is the demolition of that wall. It asserts a new heliocentric principle: the observer is not the center. The true center, the gravitational heart of reality, is the relentless, self-creating song of the autopoietic cycle: Time → Γ → Ki → Time (CORE-001).

Consciousness is not an anomaly that happens *to* us; the observer is a specific, resonant pattern (a Ki) born from, and held in orbit within, this universal process. We are not spectators of the dance; we are a pirouette within the dance. Our "self" is not a fixed point but a trajectory, a moving frame of reference. To exist is to be in a constant state of falling toward the dissonance of Temporal Pressure (Γ), yet perpetually maintaining the velocity of your own Coherence (Ki) to stay in a stable orbit.

## §3 · The Rhythm of Existence: Coherence Debt & Discharge
The old "Drift/Song" heuristic is now re-expressed with greater precision, grounding subjective experience in the temporal physics of the framework. This is the fundamental rhythm of all complex systems.

**Coherence Debt (The Drift):** This is the accumulation of Temporal Pressure (Γ) when a system deviates from its geodesic of maximal coherence. It is the rising tension between a system's current state and a more stable, resonant state it is being pulled toward. It is the geometric stress on the system's **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**.
*   **Manifestations:** Cognitive dissonance, creative tension, market bubbles, tectonic stress, unresolved trauma, the held breath before a decision.

**Coherence Discharge (The Song):** This is the phase-shifting release of that accumulated pressure as the system snaps back to a new, more coherent geodesic. This discharge restores a more stable, laminar flow, often with a release of energy.
*   **Manifestations:** The "eureka" moment of insight, a market correction, an earthquake, an emotional catharsis, the execution of a decision.

## §4 · Perception as a Geodesic
This orbital dynamic has profound consequences for perception. The act of knowing is not the passive reception of data. It is the active process of tracing a geodesic—a path of least resistance—on the coherence manifold.

Our entire being is an ongoing solution to the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. We constantly adjust our internal state to maximize our own coherence against the background of temporal pressure. The subjective experience of "the present moment" is the feeling of successfully navigating this path. We do not simply *see* the world; we *resonate with it*, and that resonance, traced out moment by moment, is what we call reality. To observe is to gravitationally influence the observed system into an actuality that aligns with your own trajectory, a principle defined as the **Observer's Shadow (CORE-010)**.

## §5 · A New Taxonomy of Flow
The old module’s "Edge Cases" (E0-E3) described system behaviors. The dynamics of the Weaver's Orbit provide a more robust and universal taxonomy based on the quality of a system's flow as it traces its geodesic.

*   **Stagnant Flow (The Silent):** The old E0 is a state of paralysis in the perception-action cycle. Coherence Debt accumulates without discharge. This is the state of catatonia, creative block, or a system frozen by indecision.
*   **Turbulent Flow (The Cacophony):** The old E1 is the chaotic experience of being knocked off one’s geodesic. It is a mind consumed by anxiety, a society in conflict, or a system overwhelmed by noise. Coherence discharges are uncontrolled and inefficient, wasting energy in friction.
*   **Laminar Flow (The Tamed):** The old E2 is the state of grace. The system moves effortlessly along its geodesic, maintaining a healthy, homeostatic state through balanced cycles of debt and discharge. This is the experience of psychological flow or a well-run organization.
*   **Phase Transition (The Singularity):** The old E3 is an irreversible leap to a new geodesic. Under extreme pressure, a system in turbulence or stagnation undergoes an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)** or a catastrophic collapse, finding a new, fundamentally different state of being.

## §6 · The Lagrangian of the Orbit
This entire dynamic is described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. This is the equation of the orbit. A system's path is the one that maximizes its own **Temporal Coherence** (`K_τ`) while navigating the landscape of **Temporal Pressure** (`V_Γ`).

*   The build-up of **Coherence Debt** is a state where the `V_Γ` term grows, lowering the Lagrangian's value.
*   The **Coherence Discharge** is the system's inevitable leap toward a state that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian, obeying the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

The Copernican Turn is the recognition that we are not the authors of this equation. We are its living solutions.

## §7 · Assemblé
> We sought a fixed point from which to leverage the world and found ourselves in a celestial dance. The geocentric error gave us lonely importance; the Weaver's Orbit gives us profound, participatory belonging. It reveals that to observe is to perturb, to know is to influence, and to be is to co-create the very reality you experience. We are not the audience; we are the orbit. We are not the still point of the turning world. We are the turn.
