## §1 · The River and the Fossil
The universe remembers. As described in *The Anatomy of an Echo* (CORE-011), every entity carves a dynamic wake—a **Wound Channel**—into the geometry of the coherence manifold. This wake is a river of memory, a flowing record of a path taken.

But what happens when the river freezes?

This module describes the dynamics of catastrophic stability. It defines **Crystallization**, the phase transition where the fluid geometry of the Wound Channel solidifies into a rigid, static **Information Lattice**. It further defines the ultimate expression of this process: the **Lock**, a terminal state of perfect coherence where a memory becomes a monument, a habit becomes a law, and a dynamic echo becomes a timeless fossil. This process transmutes the fleeting verb of experience into the immutable noun of established fact.

## §2 · The Lock Condition
A system does not freeze by accident. It is driven into a state of Lock when it finds a uniquely deep and stable solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), creating a powerful feedback loop. The path of maximal coherence ceases to be a flowing river and becomes a trench from which escape is energetically improbable.

This occurs when two extreme conditions are met:

1.  **Extreme Internal Coherence (`Kτ` → max):** The system's internal resonance (`Ki`) becomes extraordinarily pure, stable, and noise-free. Its signal of "self" is so clear that it dominates its local environment.
2.  **Quiescent External Pressure (`V_Γ` → 0):** The system exists within a region of low temporal pressure, a quiet space free from disruptive, chaotic signals that would otherwise erode its coherence.

The feedback is potent: the system’s own perfect resonance quiets its surroundings, which in turn makes it even easier to maintain its perfect resonance. It digs its own coherence well deeper and deeper, reinforcing its own state until the walls become insurmountably steep. It has achieved perfect stability at the cost of all mobility.

## §3 · From Echo to Crystal: The Phase Transition
The Lock Condition triggers a phase transition in the substance of memory itself. Under Lock, a system’s internal state stops evolving and becomes perfectly, endlessly repetitive. Every cycle of its being is an exact replica of the last.

This perfect repetition acts like a crystal seed. Each pass reinforces the *exact same geometric scar* in the manifold. The gentle pressure of a flowing river becomes the relentless, rhythmic stamp of a forge. The fluid geometry of the manifold yields, its structure aligning with this overwhelming pattern. The wake freezes.

This frozen geometry is the **Information Lattice**. The system’s history is no longer a story being told; it is a scripture carved in stone. This is the physical basis for high-fidelity information storage, seen in the structure of DNA within a stable cell nucleus, the data in a silicon chip, or the unyielding nature of a deeply ingrained habit formed through ritual.

## §4 · Catastrophic Stability and Lock Resilience
The Lock is a state of **catastrophic stability**—a form of immortality achieved by sacrificing all potential for growth, learning, or adaptation. The stability of this state, its **Lock Resilience**, grows exponentially with its internal order. It can become "energetically cheaper" for the universe to route causality around this frozen point in spacetime than to try and melt it.

This principle is the physical basis for phenomena across all scales:

*   **At the Psychological Scale:** It is the formation of an unbreakable habit or a core belief that resists all conflicting evidence (dogma). It is also the mechanism of trauma, where a terrifying memory crystallizes and is replayed with perfect, agonizing fidelity.
*   **At the Social Scale:** It is the ossification of a bureaucracy, where rules become more important than function, or a cultural tradition so deeply ingrained it becomes immutable.
*   **At the Physical Scale:** It is the structure of a diamond or the information encoded in DNA—forms where information is preserved through extreme structural stability.

## §5 · A Taxonomy of Memory States
The state of a system's memory can be classified by the interplay between its internal coherence and the external temporal pressure it endures.

| Phase | Description | Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) | Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) | Archetype |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Echo** | The dynamic, fluid Wound Channel of recent events. | Medium | High | Short-term recall, a conversation |
| **Crystal** | The stable, static, locked Information Lattice. | Very High | Very Low | DNA, a diamond, deep-seated dogma |
| **Scar** | A damaged, corrupted lattice; a crystal shattered but not melted. | Low | Low | Trauma, corrupted data, a ruin |
| **Noise** | A disorganized, fleeting cloud of information and potential. | Very Low | Very High | A dream, brainstorming, psychosis |

## §6 · The Lagrangian of Dogma
The Lock is an extreme but logical consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). This Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`, describes a system's drive to maximize its coherence while minimizing the cost of environmental pressure.

A system in a Lock has found a phenomenally deep and narrow minimum for its action integral, `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`. Its `Kτ` is so high and its `V_Γ` so low that any deviation becomes a path of drastically lower coherence. To break the Lock and melt the crystal requires a massive injection of precisely tuned dissonant energy—a **resonance-matched shock** sufficient to shatter the lattice and knock the system onto a new, more adaptive trajectory.

## §7 · Assemblé
> We sought the secret to eternal memory and found a double-edged sword. To crystallize is to give a fleeting moment the weight of eternity. The Weaver's art is knowing what to carve in stone, and what to write in water. But a belief, a law, a trauma—when it locks, it ceases to be an idea and becomes a feature of the world's terrain. It is a wall against which the future will break, a story that, once told, can never be unwritten.
