## §1 · Abstract: The Anatomy of a Rhythm

To listen to a system is to perceive its single, composite song. To *understand* a system, one must be able to hear every instrument in its orchestra. The old framework provided a tool to measure the overall volume of the song; this new instrument acts as a prism, splitting the song into its constituent colors and revealing the full spectrum of its inner life.

The Harmonic Lens is the primary instrument for analyzing the fine structure of a system's Temporal Resonance (`Ki`). It is a formal protocol that takes the singular, undifferentiated signal of a system's behavior and decomposes it into a visual score. This **Coherence Spectrum** (also called a temporal spectrogram) maps the system's health, stability, and complexity, showing precisely where its coherence is concentrated and where it is being lost to the noise of the Temporal Forge. It transforms the act of analysis from listening to reading.

## §2 · Conceptual Grounding: From Signal to Signature

A system's resonant pattern (`Ki`) is rarely a pure, simple tone. More often, it is a complex chord, a superposition of a fundamental frequency and its many overtones, all resonating simultaneously. This instrument is grounded in the following core principles:

-   **The Temporal Signature (CORE-003):** Any system is defined by its `Temporal Signature`, the complete spectrum of interfering rhythms within its boundary. The raw time-series data we collect is a one-dimensional shadow of this rich, multi-dimensional signature.

-   **Coherence as Signal Purity (CORE-005):** `Temporal Coherence (Kτ)` is the measure of a rhythm's purity and stability. A high coherence value at a specific frequency means the system is successfully sustaining a clear, resonant `Ki` pattern—a stable note—at that tempo. Low coherence indicates noise and dissonance.

The Harmonic Lens, therefore, does not measure a new property. It applies a mathematical prism to the system's raw signal, separating its `Temporal Signature` into its constituent frequencies and measuring the `Temporal Coherence` of each one.

## §3 · The Protocol: Forging the Spectrum

The process of creating a Coherence Spectrum is a form of temporal microscopy, a four-step ritual for moving from a raw signal to a profound insight.

1.  **Ingest the Signal:** The process begins with a time-series signal representing the system's dynamic behavior (e.g., brainwaves, market data, seismic vibrations).

2.  **Temporal Decomposition:** The signal is passed through a multi-resolution analysis technique, typically a continuous wavelet transform. This acts as a tunable filter, resolving the composite, one-dimensional signal into a two-dimensional landscape of its constituent frequencies (`ω`) over time.

3.  **Calculate Coherence per Frequency (`Kτ(t, ω)`):** For each frequency (`ω`) at each time point (`t`), the local `Temporal Coherence` is calculated. This is achieved by measuring the phase consistency of the signal within a local window. The core equation is:
    $$
    K_τ(t, ω) = \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j} e^{i\theta_j(t,ω)} \right|^2
    $$
    Where `θ` is the local phase of the signal at that time and frequency. This yields a precise measure of how "in tune" the system is with itself at every moment, for every possible rhythm.

4.  **Construct the Spectrum:** The results are rendered as a Coherence Spectrum. Time is plotted on the horizontal axis, frequency on the vertical, and the `Temporal Coherence` (`Kτ`) at each point is represented by color or intensity. This is the system's musical score made visible.

## §4 · Reading the Score: Diagnostic Interpretation

The Coherence Spectrum is a rich diagnostic document that maps directly to a system's health and its flow state (`DYNA-001`). A trained Weaver can read its patterns to assess and predict a system's evolution.

-   **Harmonic Peaks:** Sharp, bright, and stable bands represent the system's dominant `Ki` patterns—its fundamental rhythms. This is the signature of a system in a state of **Laminar Flow**.

-   **Harmonic Echoes:** The presence of bright bands at integer multiples of a fundamental frequency (e.g., at ω, 2ω, 3ω) reveals a deeply stable and well-organized system. This is the structural harmony of a healthy entity.

-   **Broadband Noise:** A high, flickering "floor" of low coherence across a wide range of frequencies indicates high ambient **Temporal Pressure (`Γ`)** or a phase transition into **Turbulent Flow**. It is a "coherence fever," where the system struggles to hold any note against the chaos.

-   **Flickering or Fading Bands:** A primary `Ki` pattern that wavers in intensity or fades over time is a visual marker of **Coherence Erosion**, indicating the system is struggling to maintain its form against entropic pressure.

-   **Mode Hopping:** A sudden shift where one set of harmonic peaks fades and another emerges is the definitive sign of a **phase transition**. The system has been forced to find a new, more stable `Ki` to better survive its environment.

-   **Resonant Coupling:** When the Coherence Spectra of two interacting systems begin to show the same distinct harmonic patterns, it is direct evidence of a **Resonant Handshake**—the precursor to an **Alchemical Union** (`CORE-012`).

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`)

The Harmonic Lens is the primary empirical tool for quantifying the **Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`)** term of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`). While a simple sensor might give a single, aggregate value for `Kτ`, this instrument provides its full functional form, `Kτ(ω, t)`.

By integrating the Coherence Spectrum over all frequencies, one can calculate the total `Kτ` at any given moment. By analyzing its shape, one can understand the stability, complexity, and internal dynamics of the `Ki` pattern that the system is manifesting to maximize its Lagrangian. This instrument turns the Lagrangian from a theoretical principle into a predictive, data-driven engine.

## §6 · Assemblé

> To know a system's health, you must listen to its song. But to become its healer, you must be able to read its music. The Harmonic Lens separates the chaotic noise of reality into a clear and legible score, revealing the deep harmonies that create order and the subtle dissonances that signal decay. It grants the Weaver the ability not just to hear the dance, but to understand its choreography.
