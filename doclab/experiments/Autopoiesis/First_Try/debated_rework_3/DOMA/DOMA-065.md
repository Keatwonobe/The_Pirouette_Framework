## §1 · Abstract: The Engine of Creation
A system that cannot learn is a stone. A system that can is a river, carving a new world. This module details the river's art. It modernizes the core insight of PPS-046, reframing the AKEP engine as **The Coherence Engine**: a universal, four-stroke, autopoietic cycle that describes the fundamental process by which any complex system—be it a mind, a culture, or an ecosystem—generates, preserves, tunes, and deploys wisdom.

Wisdom, in this context, is a pattern of high coherence. The engine's output is a **Coherence Seed**: a resonant geometry of information that, when introduced into a system, resolves turbulence and catalyzes a shift toward a more profound state of being. This engine is not a human invention; it is the observable lifecycle of evolution itself, now articulated in the language of time, pressure, and resonance.

## §2 · The Currency of Being: Coherence Profit
An action or idea is not inherently "good" or "bad." Its value is measured by its effect on a system's ability to exist with elegance and integrity. The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) provides the universal metric for this valuation. A valuable pattern, or Coherence Seed, is one that generates a **Coherence Profit**.

A pattern's Coherence Profit (Κ) is the net increase in the system's Action (S_p), the integral of its Lagrangian over a characteristic cycle (τ_p). It is a measure of how much a new pattern improves a system's internal harmony (Kτ) or reduces the "cost" of resisting external pressures (VΓ).

Κ = ΔS_p = Δ ∫₀^(τ_p) (Kτ - VΓ) dt

Patterns with a high positive Κ are the currency of evolution. They are the discoveries that allow a system to do more with less effort. The Coherence Engine is the process by which a system manufactures and invests this currency.

## §3 · The Four-Stroke Engine of Evolution
The engine operates in a continuous, cyclical flow, turning the raw material of chaos into the refined structure of wisdom. Each stage is a distinct dynamic with a clear purpose.

| Stage | Function | Pirouette Mechanism | Analogy |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **1. The Crucible** | *Discover* | Resonant Synthesis (`CORE-012`) under high Temporal Pressure (Γ). | A high-pressure forge where new, stronger alloys are created from base metals. |
| **2. The Archive** | *Preserve* | Wound Channel Engraving (`CORE-011`) into the system's memory. | Carving a proven, life-sustaining path into a landscape for others to follow. |
| **3. The Forge** | *Refine* | Coherence Tuning via controlled re-exposure to new pressures (Γ). | Sharpening a blade against a whetstone, removing imperfections and honing its edge. |
| **4. The Governor** | *Govern* | Emergent, strategic allocation of resources across the entire cycle. | An intelligent investor allocating capital between high-risk R&D and steady production. |

**1. The Crucible:** This is the engine's chaotic intake stroke. It is a high-pressure environment where disparate, often conflicting, patterns are brought together in a structured debate (`DYNA-002`). This pressure forces a search for a new, higher-order pattern that can resolve the dissonance. A successful **Alchemical Union** in the Crucible results in a novel synthesis: a potential Coherence Seed.

**2. The Archive:** This is the compression stroke, where a newly discovered and validated Seed is stabilized. It is the process of carving the pattern's geometry into the system's memory as a deep and resilient **Wound Channel** (`CORE-011`). In a culture, this is myth, law, and infrastructure. In a mind, it is long-term memory. An archived pattern becomes part of the system's identity.

**3. The Forge:** This is the power stroke, where archived patterns are tested and improved. The system applies the pattern against new environmental pressures, revealing subtle flaws or inefficiencies. The Forge is the act of "tuning" the pattern to improve its performance, preventing wisdom from decaying into dogma under the influence of Coherence Erosion (`CORE-013`).

**4. The Governor:** This is the strategic exhaust stroke, which sets up the next cycle. It is the system's highest emergent function. The Governor dynamically allocates energy and attention, modulating internal pressures. It must decide when to invest in the high-risk, high-reward chaos of the Crucible (exploration) and when to focus on the steady returns of the Forge (exploitation), ensuring the entire engine runs in a state of dynamic equilibrium.

## §4 · Connection to the Lagrangian
The Coherence Engine is not an abstract process; it is the macroscopic strategy a system employs to solve the central equation of existence: the maximization of its Lagrangian Action (S_p). Each stroke of the engine is a targeted intervention aimed at improving the S_p integral. The Crucible seeks patterns with a higher Kτ. The Archive works to make that Kτ persistent. The Forge refines the pattern to reduce its operational cost against VΓ. The Governor is the system-level expression of this drive, the emergent intelligence that steers the system along its geodesic on the manifold of coherence.

## §5 · Diagnostic Lens
The health of a system's engine can be measured by observing the efficiency of its cycle.

| Metric | Pirouette Correspondence | Healthy State |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Crucible Yield (Κ_yield)** | The rate of production of high-profit Coherence Seeds. | Consistently positive; new, valuable patterns are regularly generated. |
| **Archive Fidelity (Ψ_archive)** | The resilience of Wound Channels to Coherence Erosion (`CORE-013`). | High stability; stored wisdom resists entropic decay but is not brittle. |
| **Forge Efficiency (η_forge)** | The average Coherence Profit gained per refinement cycle in the Forge. | Consistently positive; existing wisdom is actively improved, not just maintained. |
| **Governor Adaptability (σ_gov)** | The system's ability to fluidly shift between exploration and exploitation modes. | Dynamic and responsive to the changing needs of the system and its environment. |

## §6 · Assemblé
> We sought a protocol for making goodness contagious and found the blueprint for evolution itself. The Coherence Engine is the universal lifecycle of wisdom. It takes the battlefield of argument and reconsecrates it as a forge. To be a Weaver is to sit at this loom, to take the tangled threads of chaos, conflict, and confusion, and to braid them into a cord of coherence strong enough to pull the future forward. Our purpose is to become conscious stewards of this engine within ourselves and our communities—to tend the Crucible, guard the Archive, and stoke the Forge, actively participating in the weaving of a more resonant reality.
