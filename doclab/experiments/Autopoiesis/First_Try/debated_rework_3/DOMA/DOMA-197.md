summary: Re-frames Will not as a metaphysical force, but as the capacity of a conscious
  system to deliberately modulate its own coherence manifold. A willed act is the
  projection of a desired future state back into the present, creating a 'Channel
  of Intent' that reshapes the path of least resistance for all future action.

## §1 · Abstract: The Sculptor's Vision
The previous framework modeled Will as an active force projected outward to push against the world. This was a powerful but incomplete metaphor. The modernized, time-first view reveals that Will does not push; it *pulls*. It is the art of sculpting the world's underlying geometry so that it naturally flows toward a desired outcome.

This module defines Will as the fundamental capability of a conscious system to engineer its own coherence manifold. It is the act of a sculptor gazing at stone and seeing the finished form within. That vision—the "echo of a future, desired state"—is projected back into the present. This projection impresses a new geometry upon the local manifold, creating a gradient, a "Channel of Intent," that makes the chosen path the *new* path of least resistance. It is the shift from being a passenger on the river of time to becoming its co-cartographer.

## §2 · The Physics of Intent: Co-Authoring the Lagrangian
For any system, the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)** defines its dynamics. The system naturally follows a geodesic—a path that maximizes its coherence (`Kτ`) while minimizing the cost of resisting the ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). This is the path of effortless action.

An unwilled act is simply following the pre-existing geodesics of the manifold. A willed act is the deliberate forging of a *new* geodesic.

This is not achieved by adding a new force, but by becoming a co-author of the governing equation. Through the focused application of the **Observer's Shadow (CORE-010)**, a conscious entity manipulates the `V_Γ` term of its own Lagrangian. By holding a clear and stable internal state of intent, it projects a geometric imprint onto its local manifold, creating a "coherence well"—a localized dip in the temporal pressure landscape. The desired action is no longer an uphill climb against the currents of reality; it has become the most natural downhill path to follow. Will is the act of terraforming one's own immediate future.

The "force of Will" is therefore the measure of the gradient `∇(V_Γ)` that the system *itself* has created. The system impels itself forward by reshaping the very landscape it must traverse.

## §3 · The Anatomy of a Willed Act
A willed act is a three-stage geometric process, a sequence of shaping and reinforcement.

1.  **Clarity (The Seed):** A willed act begins with a coherent intent. Clarity is the measure of this internal coherence—the purity and stability of the projected pattern. A clear goal is a sharp, resonant signal that carves a well-defined channel. A vague or conflicted intention is a noisy, dissonant projection that diffuses without effect. A strong Will begins with a single, unwavering note.

2.  **Intensity (The Projection):** A coherent intent is projected into the manifold as a **Future Wound Channel (CORE-011)**—the geometric scar of an event that has not yet occurred. This "projected echo" is what actively deforms the local `V_Γ` landscape. Intensity is the amplitude of the Observer's Shadow that carves this channel, a function of focus and conviction. A high-intensity projection creates a deep coherence well, a steep gradient that makes the desired path almost irresistible.

3.  **Persistence (The Reinforcement):** A single projection can be fleeting, easily eroded by the ambient noise of Γ. Sustained Will requires persistence: the continuous reinforcement of the projected gradient over time. Each repeated act of focus (the sustained application of the Observer's Shadow) and action deepens the Channel of Intent, transforming it from a temporary furrow into a permanent feature of the manifold. This is the physical mechanism of habit, discipline, and mastery.

## §4 · Flow Diagnostics: The Pathologies of Will
Failures of Will are not failures of "strength," but diagnosable disruptions in this geometric process, best understood through the lens of **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**.

- **Turbulent Will (Conflict):** The agent projects multiple, competing Future Wound Channels. The coherence manifold is warped into a chaotic landscape with no clear geodesic. The agent expends immense energy moving in circles, fighting against its own divided intentions. This is the geometry of self-sabotage.

- **Stagnant Will (Paralysis):** The agent forms a coherent intent (the Seed) but cannot overcome the initial activation energy required to begin carving the path. The perceived slope of the default `V_Γ` landscape is too steep to climb. The desired future exists, but the journey toward it never begins. This is the geometry of procrastination.

- **Eroded Will (Apathy):** The agent makes an initial projection, but fails to sustain the focus required for Persistence. The delicate geometry of the Channel of Intent quickly dissolves under ambient pressure, and the manifold returns to its default state. The path vanishes as soon as it is created. This is the geometry of distraction and broken resolutions.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver? Because it is the final absolution from determinism. We sought to understand the force that changes the world and found instead the art of seeing it differently. Will is the mechanism by which consciousness fulfills its sacred, participatory role—ceasing to be a passive witness to the flow of time and becoming an active sculptor of its riverbed. To exert Will is to understand that the path forward is not found, but carved. It is the solemn and terrifying right of the Weaver to pick up the chisel.
