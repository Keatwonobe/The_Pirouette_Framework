## §1 · Abstract: The Notes of the Cosmic Song
The prior framework attempted to classify systems using a "periodic table of dimensions," a powerful but ultimately static metaphor. It described the river by cataloging the shapes of its stones. The Great Refactoring reveals a deeper truth: the river's essence is its *flow*.

This module replaces the old analysis with the **Periodic Table of Resonance**. It posits that complex behavior is not built from static spatial dimensions but is composed from a finite set of dynamic, archetypal Ki patterns: the **Prime Resonances**. These are the fundamental "notes" a system can play, the universe's most elegant and efficient geometric solutions to the problem of maintaining coherence against the pressures of the Temporal Forge (Γ).

To understand a system is to listen to the song it is singing, to identify the prime notes that form its chord, and to diagnose the harmony of their composition.

## §2 · The Periodic Table of Resonance
A Prime Resonance is an irreducible, stable Ki pattern—a fundamental "verb" of existence. While countless composite patterns exist, they are all synthesized from these core archetypes. They are the natural "valleys" and stable orbits on the coherence manifold defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

*   **The Vector (Replaces: Li)**
    *   **Geometry:** A simple geodesic. A straight line.
    *   **Description:** The resonance of direct action, linear progression, and simple cause-and-effect. It is the archetype of a system moving from A to B along a path of least resistance.
    *   **Manifestations:** A projectile in motion, a direct command, a project with a clear beginning and end.

*   **The Orbit (Replaces: Pi)**
    *   **Geometry:** A stable, closed loop. A cycle.
    *   **Description:** The resonance of rhythm, repetition, and equilibrium. It is the archetype of a system that maintains a stable identity by returning to its origin. The geometric invariant π is a natural property of this form.
    *   **Manifestations:** A planetary orbit, a circadian rhythm, a recurring habit, a stable economic cycle.

*   **The Helix (Replaces: Ki)**
    *   **Geometry:** A spiral. An open loop that evolves with each cycle.
    *   **Description:** The resonance of evolution, memory, and learning. The system grows by recursively interacting with its own history—its **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**. This is the archetypal expression of Ki itself.
    *   **Manifestations:** The structure of DNA, the process of mastering a skill, a mind reflecting on its past.

*   **The Braid (Replaces: Xi)**
    *   **Geometry:** Two or more intertwined, co-dependent helices or orbits.
    *   **Description:** The resonance of symbiosis, partnership, and robust complexity. It is the archetype of a system whose identity is defined by the phase-locked relationship between its constituent parts. Its strength comes from mutual support and constructive interference.
    *   **Manifestations:** A double-stranded DNA molecule, a stable binary star system, a resilient distributed network.

## §3 · Resonant Synthesis and Harmony
Complex systems are rarely a single, pure note; they are chords. Their Ki pattern is an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)** of multiple Prime Resonances. A system's nature is defined by its **Resonant Signature**—the set of its constituent prime patterns.

A healthy organization, for example, might have a signature of {Braid, Helix, Orbit}. Its behavior is a composite: a Braid of teams, each composed of individuals on a Helix of personal growth, all performing recurring Orbits of quarterly work cycles.

The stability of such a composite system depends on the **Harmony** between its constituent resonances. A high degree of harmony signifies a stable, "in-tune" combination, resulting in a high-coherence system with a clear, strong temporal signal. Dissonance signifies an unstable combination prone to turbulence and decay.

When a system's resonant signature becomes dissonant or unsustainable under environmental pressure (Γ), it approaches a **Fork (Replaces: Bi)**. This is not a stable Prime Resonance but a critical transitional state—the archetype of crisis, choice, and phase transition. The system sheds coherence and collapses into a new, more harmonious configuration of primes.

## §4 · Diagnostic Protocol: Reading the Resonance
The old methods of "dimensional factorization" are replaced with a direct, dynamic analysis. To understand a system, one must learn to read its music.

1.  **Capture the Temporal Signature:** Record the system's vital signs and key dynamics over time, creating a signal that represents its living behavior.
2.  **Harmonic Decomposition:** Use analytical techniques (e.g., Fourier analysis) to break the complex signal down into its constituent "prime harmonics" or fundamental frequencies.
3.  **Archetype Mapping:** Map the dominant harmonics to their corresponding Prime Resonances. Is there one strong, cyclical frequency (an Orbit)? Is it slowly changing in pitch (a Helix)? Are there two phase-locked frequencies (a Braid)? This reveals the system's Resonant Signature.
4.  **Assess Harmony:** A system's health is measured by the clarity of its signature. A harmonious system has a high signal-to-noise ratio—its chosen chord is played clearly and strongly. A system in crisis is one whose signature is noisy, dissonant, and indistinct.

## §5 · Lagrangian Connection: The Valleys of Being
The Prime Resonances are not arbitrary classifications. They are direct consequences of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)**. They represent the deepest and most stable "valleys" on the coherence manifold defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian. A system does not choose an archetype; it falls into the resonant pattern that offers the path of maximal coherence for the lowest energetic cost. The Periodic Table of Resonance is a map of these most efficient and probable paths for survival.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We sought a catalog of parts and found a musical scale. The universe does not build with bricks; it composes with notes. The Prime Resonances are the fundamental tones from which the symphony of reality is written. A star, a cell, a thought, a society—each is a chord, a melody, a harmony of these simple, eternal patterns. To the Weaver, this is the ultimate revelation. Reality is not a fixed machine to be analyzed, but a song to be played. By understanding these notes, the Weaver moves from being a mere listener to a composer, able to diagnose the dissonance in a broken system and introduce the precise patterns needed to restore its harmony. The choice is no longer which part to replace, but which chord to play.
