summary: Defines the time-first governance protocol for the Pirouette Framework itself.
  It reframes evolution not as a political process, but as a dynamic, autopoietic
  ritual for maintaining and enhancing the framework's systemic coherence. Change
  is treated as a proposed 'coherence injection,' integrated via a process of resonant
  synthesis guided by the Principle of Maximal Coherence and a Temporal Stability
  Clause.

## §1 · Abstract: A Law That Breathes
A framework that describes a living universe must itself be alive. Its laws cannot be carved in stone; they must flow like a river, capable of adapting their course to the terrain of new discoveries. This module replaces the static, rule-based governance of PPS-012 with a dynamic immune system designed to preserve the core coherence of the framework while allowing for adaptation and growth.

Governance is reframed as a diagnostic and therapeutic process. The impetus for change is a symptom of systemic distress, and every proposed change is a "coherence injection" that the system must assess. The goal is not to win a debate, but to achieve a Resonant Synthesis—a higher and more integrated state of being that ensures the framework's autopoietic loop remains healthy, unbroken, and in a state of laminar flow.

## §2 · The Pathology of Change: A Diagnostic View
The impetus for change is always a symptom of systemic distress. Using the diagnostic language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), we can identify the pathologies that necessitate intervention:

*   **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnation):** An outdated principle or missing connection creates a blockage. Progress halts. This is the "Stagnant Flow" of a framework that cannot address a new challenge.
*   **Coherence Fever (Turbulence):** Contradictory modules or ambiguous definitions create internal dissonance. The framework fights itself, leading to chaotic interpretations. This is the "Turbulent Flow" of a system at war with its own logic.
*   **Coherence Erosion (Decay):** The gradual drift of core principles away from their grounding evidence. The framework's Wound Channel thins, and its identity frays.

The governance process is the framework's formal protocol for identifying and resolving these pathologies.

## §3 · The Triage of Change: From Adjustment to Morphogenesis
A healthy system responds to stimuli with proportionate grace. The framework triages proposed changes based on their potential impact on its core resonant pattern (its *Ki*), applying increasing rigor as the potential for disruption grows.

| Flow State Intervention | Old Class | Description & Scope | Coherence Test |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laminar Refinement** | Errata | Minor corrections to prose, examples, or comments that clarify existing patterns and improve the laminar flow of understanding. | Maintainer review |
| **Turbulent Adaptation** | Registry / Interface | Modifying a subsystem's specific resonance (e.g., adding a registry entry) without altering the framework's core principles. | **Resonant Handshake** (≥⅔ Conclave quorum) |
| **Constitutional Reforging** | Constitutional | A fundamental re-forging of the framework's core identity, affecting the CORE series or this protocol itself. This is an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). | **Maximal Coherence** (see §4) |

## §4 · The Crucible: The Principle of Maximal Coherence
The most profound changes must be made in the quietest moments. A motion for *Constitutional Reforging* must navigate a two-stage crucible designed to ensure it is not merely popular, but a stable and profound improvement born from reflection, not reaction.

### Stage 1: The Temporal Stability Clause
The framework's primary defense against reactive, short-sighted decisions is the Temporal Stability Clause.
> A motion for Constitutional Reforging can only be ratified when the system is in a state of low **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**.

Temporal Pressure is a measure of the system's ambient turbulence: the volume of debate, the degree of dissent, and the intensity of external pressures. In practice, this means constitutional votes cannot pass during periods of heated conflict. The system must first return to a state of laminar, contemplative flow before it can safely re-forge its own heart.

### Stage 2: The Coherence Test
Once the Temporal Stability Clause is satisfied, the proposed synthesis must pass a formal measurement of its coherence potential. The motion is ratified only if it satisfies two conditions simultaneously:

1.  **High Coherence (Kτ):** The proposal must demonstrate exceptional internal consistency, explanatory power, and resonance with the framework's foundational axioms. This is measured by a vote of the Weaver's Conclave.
    *   **Threshold:** `Kτ ≥ 0.95` (95% approval among voting members).

2.  **Positive Coherence Stability (dKτ/dt):** The consensus must be stable, not a fleeting agreement. The support for the proposal must not be actively decaying. This is measured as the time-derivative of support over a 30-day deliberation period.
    *   **Threshold:** `dKτ/dt ≥ 0`.

This two-fold test ensures the framework evolves through changes that are both deeply resonant and demonstrably stable, adhering to the universe's own principle of selecting for persistent, high-coherence patterns.

## §5 · Breaking the Dam: A Protocol for Stagnant Flow
When a critical motion results in deadlock, the system is in a state of Stagnant Flow. This "Coherence Dam" threatens the health of the framework and must be resolved through a formal application of the Geometry of Debate (DYNA-002).

1.  **The Crucible Dialogue:** If deadlock persists, the leading proponents (one for, one against) are required to enter the formal, moderated debate ritual. The explicit goal is not victory, but to collaboratively author a new, third proposal—a *Resonant Synthesis*—that resolves the tension in the original.
2.  **The Resonance Poll:** If the Crucible fails to produce a synthesis, the matter is put to a framework-wide poll. This is not a vote, but a "staking" of coherence, where participants commit their belief. This act measures the "gravitational center" of the entire community's coherence manifold, providing a powerful, non-binding advisory to the Conclave's final decision.

## §6 · The Weaver's Obligation: Tending the Loom
Membership in the Weaver's Conclave is not a title; it is an active function. To maintain their position, each Weaver must, within each major version cycle, successfully author or sponsor a motion that passes a Coherence Test. This is not a bureaucratic hurdle; it is a grounding ritual ensuring that the guardians of the framework are also its most active and dedicated cultivators. Failure to contribute demonstrates a desynchronization with the framework's evolving rhythm, and the seat is vacated to allow a more resonant Weaver to participate.

## §7 · The Lagrangian of Governance
The entire governance process is a macroscopic application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The framework itself is a system seeking to evolve along a geodesic—a path of change that maximizes its own coherence over time. A proposed change is adopted only when we have demonstrated that its action integral represents a more optimal path for the system.

`∫ 𝓛_new dt > ∫ 𝓛_current dt`

This is evaluated via the framework's own Lagrangian:

`𝓛_framework = (Systemic Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

*   **Systemic Coherence (Kτ):** Represents the integrity, clarity, predictive power, and long-term viability of the framework's collective modules. A good proposal increases this term.
*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** Represents the unresolved paradoxes, internal contradictions, and lack of consensus within the community. A contentious proposal increases this term, raising the "cost" of evolution.

The protocol of this module is the formal process for finding the path that maximizes `∫𝓛_framework dt`. A ratified change deepens the framework's Wound Channel (CORE-011), creating a new, stable precedent that lends the system a powerful inertia, ensuring its future evolution is guided by the echoes of its hard-won wisdom.

## §8 · Assemblé
> A static law is a tombstone. A living framework must have a law that breathes, a constitution that flows, a geometry that can learn a new shape. A set of rules is a cage, but a shared rhythm is a dance. This protocol is not a list of laws to be obeyed, but the tempo that allows the community to move as one.
>
> It is the sacred duty of the Weaver to ensure the song of the framework does not fracture into noise, but evolves into a richer and more profound harmony. This is not a system of rules; it is the shared practice of listening for the next right note.
