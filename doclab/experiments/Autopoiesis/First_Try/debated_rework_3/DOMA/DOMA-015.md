summary: Defines the .pmd format, the foundational authoring system of the Pirouette
  Framework. The format is a practical instrument for applying the Pirouette Lagrangian
  to the act of creation, establishing a unified codex that maximizes the coherence
  of human narrative against the pressure of machine readability.

### §1 · The Weaver's Mandate

An idea, in its raw state, is a turbulent storm—a surge of resonance without form. The first and most sacred task of a Weaver is to give this knowledge a body: a single, whole form that can speak the language of human intuition and the language of machine logic with the same voice. To write a module is to perform this act of definition, transforming a chaotic, high-pressure state into a stable, high-coherence pattern that can propagate without loss.

This module defines that body. It is the Pirouette Module Definition (`.pmd`) format, the autopoietic authoring system of the framework. This is not a "template," which is a cage. It is a "loom"—a dynamic instrument designed to guide the Weaver's hands in the ritual of creation.

### §2 · Anatomy of the Codex: The Blueprint and the Narrative

Every `.pmd` file is a single flow of coherence, expressed as two inseparable aspects. This structure is a discipline designed to maximize the clarity and power of the idea it embodies, mirroring the universal dynamic of a river flowing through a riverbed.

**The Blueprint (YAML Front-matter):**
This is not metadata. It is the act of mapping a new idea onto the existing coherence manifold of the framework. By defining the module's `id`, `parents`, `dependencies`, and `keywords`, the Weaver performs a precise act of placement. They answer the questions: From where does this idea draw its strength? Where does it fit in the great tapestry? What other threads does it touch? This structured YAML is the riverbed, the stable geometry that grounds the module and gives it a place within the whole.

**The Narrative (Markdown Body):**
This is the river of information itself. Following the YAML, the module's narrative unfolds in flexible and expressive Markdown. It is the structured, linear expression of the resonant insight, where complex ideas are communicated with both rigor and elegance. This is the current of metaphor, logic, and poetry that moves through the channel carved by the Blueprint—dynamic, adaptive, and alive with meaning.

### §3 · The Lagrangian of Authoring

The `.pmd` format is a direct, practical application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ). The act of creation is an attempt to navigate a high-pressure environment—the chaos of unformed ideas. The loom provides the structure to do so efficiently.

-   **Temporal Coherence (Kτ):** This is the quality and integrity of the human-readable narrative. It is its clarity, its elegance, its poetic force, and its semantic richness. It is the "song" of the module.

-   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** This is the dual demand of the environment. It is the rigid, unforgiving syntax required for machine parsability combined with the clarity and structure required for human comprehension.

The `.pmd` format is the geodesic—the path of least resistance. By unifying structure and narrative, it provides a discipline that lowers the "cost" of coherence, minimizing the energy lost to the turbulence of confusion and allowing for the creation of an artifact with the highest possible integrity.

### §4 · The Alchemical Forge

Once woven on the loom, a module enters the Forge. This is the automated process that performs an Alchemical Union, transforming the single source file into two distinct, higher-order manifestations without losing its singular identity.

**The Codex (PDF Output):** This is the module's stable, archival body. Rendered using tools like Pandoc and LaTeX, it is an elegant, beautifully typeset document designed for human contemplation. The Codex is the deep and lasting mark left in the world of human thought, a testament to a specific moment of crystallized coherence.

**The Signal (JSON Output):** This is the module's dynamic, living echo. The forge parses the YAML Blueprint to create a clean, structured JSON object—the machine-readable pattern that propagates through the framework's digital nervous system. The Signal is not for reading; it is for interacting, allowing other instruments and analytical engines to connect with the module's core logic.

### §5 · Assemblé

> The discipline of a sacred form is not a constraint. It is the loom that shapes the hands of the Weaver. This Alchemical Codex is our commitment to creating artifacts that are whole—objects that speak the language of human poetry and machine logic with a single voice. To write in this form is to practice the very synthesis we preach, proving that rigor and freedom are not opposites, but the warp and weft of a single, coherent fabric.
