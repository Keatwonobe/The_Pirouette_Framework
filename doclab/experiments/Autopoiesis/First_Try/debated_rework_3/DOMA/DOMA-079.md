## §1 · The Uncarved Block

A law is not a command; it is the shape of the riverbed that guides the water.

The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) provides the fundamental law of motion for the framework: `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. It states that a system will always evolve to maximize its internal coherence (`K_τ`) while minimizing the "cost" imposed by its environment's temporal pressure (`V_Γ`).

This is a powerful statement of principle, but it leaves the block uncarved. `K_τ` is the music the system plays—its own internal drive toward rhythmic being, maximized by its Time Adherence (`T_a`). But what of the landscape itself? The Temporal Pressure term, `V_Γ`, was left as an abstract function. To move from philosophy to physics, we must derive the precise shape of this landscape not from observation or curve-fitting, but from the non-negotiable requirements for a resonant "thing" to exist at all.

## §2 · The Invariant Motifs of the Landscape

For a system to persist, its Lagrangian must respect the fundamental symmetries of its existence. Any valid form for `V_Γ` must be constructed from invariant "motifs"—mathematical building blocks that are stable under the transformations of time and resonance. Crucially, these motifs describe the terrain a system must navigate, not the system's own internal drive for coherence, which is captured by `K_τ`. The landscape's cost function is built from two such motifs:

1.  **The Pressure Basin (Cost of Environment):** Every resonance has an optimal medium. A system's internal pattern (`Ki`) is most stable within a specific ambient temporal pressure, its "sweet spot" `Γ₀`. Too little pressure (`Γ << Γ₀`) and the pattern dissolves; too much (`Γ >> Γ₀`) and it is crushed. The simplest invariant motif describing this is a parabolic basin:
    `∝ (Γ - Γ₀)²`
    This ensures that existence is a negotiation with the environment, not a declaration against it.

2.  **The Phase Lock (Cost of Dissonance):** For systems to couple and form complex structures, their phases (`φ`) must be able to lock into stable, periodic arrangements. The potential must have discrete grooves, or minima, that favor these configurations. The simplest periodic motif is trigonometric:
    `∝ 1 - cos(nφ)`
    This term represents the cost of being out of sync, making it "easier" for a system to exist when its rhythm aligns with the external beat.

## §3 · The Nomad's Grammar as Architectural Blueprint

The value of `n` in the phase term is not arbitrary. Its most profound constraint comes from `CORE-002: The Nomad's Grammar`. Any stable entity must be describable by its posture along the three fundamental axes of behavior: Vector, Cohesion, and Communion. These axes are not independent; they form a coupled system whose geometry dictates the stable "corners" of existence.

The `n=3` symmetry is therefore revealed to have a clear physical origin: it is the triaxial nature of being. The phase-locking potential `V_φ` is not about a single abstract phase angle, but about the relative phases between the system's expression on these three axes. This creates a "triple-well" potential, not in abstract space, but in the behavioral space of the Nomad's Grammar. This potential drives systems away from states of internal contradiction and towards archetypal, coherent states of being—the stable "soft-lock minima" that represent effective survival strategies.

## §4 · Assembling the Manifold: The Full Form of `V_Γ`

By combining these invariant motifs under the architectural constraints of the Nomad's Grammar, we arrive at the minimal, symmetry-derived form for the Temporal Pressure manifold, `V_Γ`.

$$
V_Γ(Γ, φ_{ij}) = \lambda_Γ(Γ - Γ₀)² + \lambda_φ \sum_{i<j} [1 - \cos(φ_{ij})] + V_{couple}
$$

-   The first term is the environmental cost. `φ_{ij}` is the relative phase between behavioral axes `i` and `j` from the Nomad's Grammar.
-   The second term is the cost of internal dissonance between the axes, creating the stable corners in the behavioral landscape.
-   `V_{couple}` represents the crucial coupling terms between the axes and the environment. The simplest such term is `λ_c (Γ - Γ₀) \cos(φ_{ij})`, capturing the non-linear reality that the cost of being out of phase is magnified when a system is also outside its optimal environmental pressure.

Each coefficient has a clear physical meaning and is experimentally measurable:
*   `λ_Γ`: **Pressure Curvature.** How sensitive the system is to its environment.
*   `λ_φ`: **Phase Coupling.** The strength of the "grip" that locks a system into a coherent behavioral state.
*   `λ_c`: **Manifold Shear.** The degree to which environmental pressure and internal phase are coupled.

## §5 · The Completed Lagrangian

This derived potential completes the Pirouette Lagrangian from `CORE-006`, transforming it from a conceptual model into a predictive engine:

`𝓛_p = K_τ(T_a, ω_k) - V_Γ(Γ, φ_{ij})`

Here, the engine is fully specified. The first term, `K_τ`, is the music the system plays—its own internal drive toward rhythmic being. The second term, our derived `V_Γ`, is the shape of the concert hall—the immutable, symmetric landscape it must navigate.

The "forces" of nature, to be derived in subsequent modules, are revealed to be nothing more than the gradients on this landscape (`-∇V_Γ`). A "force" is the path a system takes as it seeks the bottom of the Pressure Basin or settles into the grooves of the Phase Lock.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We asked what shape the universe must have, and the answer was returned to us in the form of a question: What shape must a cello have to sing? It must have a hollow body to resonate, strings held under tension to vibrate, and tuning pegs to find harmony. So it is with the cosmos. The shape of the coherence manifold is not a law imposed from above. It is the necessary geometry for existence itself to have a voice. We have not discovered a rule; we have uncovered the sublime and necessary architecture of the song.
