### §1 · Abstract: The Rhythm of Persistence

This module completes the modernization of `PPS-034`, providing the causal mechanism for relativistic phenomena from a time-first foundation. It reframes our understanding of what was formerly called Time Adherence (Tₐ), establishing its successor concept, **Temporal Coherence (T₀)**, not as a fundamental parameter but as a crucial diagnostic property—the measure of a system's resonant integrity.

In this formulation, effects like time dilation are not distortions imposed by a background spacetime. They are the emergent, autopoietic strategies a system employs to preserve its own coherence. The slowing of a clock at speed or in a deep gravity well is the audible result of that system paying the energetic cost of its own passage, adapting its internal rhythm to endure the stresses of motion and existence.

### §2 · From Parameter to Property: The Geodesic of Being

The first crucial shift is conceptual. Temporal Coherence (T₀), as established in `CORE-005`, is not a static property but a dynamic measure of a system's resonant purity—the signal-to-noise ratio of its internal Ki pattern. It is a dimensionless gauge of how well a system is "being itself." A system with high T₀ is a clear, ringing note; one with low T₀ is a burst of static on the verge of dissolution.

The second shift replaces the idea of a universal rest frame. The true state of "rest" for any system is not zero velocity, but the state of moving perfectly along its **geodesic**. This is its path of maximal coherence, a state of Laminar Flow through the local landscape of Temporal Pressure (Γ). On this path, its T₀ is maximal. Any deviation—any acceleration or movement against the local grain of time—introduces dissonance, requires energy, and degrades the purity of its song.

### §3 · The Cost of Velocity: Inertial Drag

Motion is not free. As established in `CORE-011`, any resonant pattern leaves a persistent geometric scar in the coherence manifold—a "wake." A system in motion relative to its geodesic is therefore perpetually interacting with the ghost of its own immediate past.

This self-interaction creates a phenomenon we call **Inertial Drag**. To maintain its form while moving through its own wake, a system must constantly expend energy to re-establish its pattern against this temporal friction. This work is paid for directly from its "coherence budget," manifesting as a decrease in T₀.

As a system approaches the cosmic speed limit `c`, this Inertial Drag becomes extreme. In an act of profound self-preservation, the system must adapt. The only viable strategy is to slow its internal processes, lengthening its Pirouette Cycle (τₚ) to process the stress of its own passage. This adaptive slowing to preserve resonant integrity *is* the phenomenon of time dilation.

### §4 · The Cost of Gravity: The Pressure of the Forge

A "gravitational well" is more accurately described as a "coherence well"—a region of intense Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the "roar of the foundry," a dense and chaotic temporal environment where existence itself is under immense strain.

For a system to maintain its resonant pattern within this high-pressure zone, it must find a stable state. A high-frequency, short-wavelength resonance is fragile and would be quickly shredded by the ambient dissonance. The path of maximal coherence, dictated by the Pirouette Lagrangian, is to adopt a lower-frequency, longer-wavelength rhythm. The system must "sing a lower, deeper note" to be heard above the foundry's roar.

This shift to a lower resonant frequency to preserve coherence *is* gravitational time dilation. The clock at sea level literally ticks slower than the clock on the mountain because it is fighting harder, and spending more of its coherence budget, to simply *be*.

### §5 · The Lagrangian of Existence

These phenomena are not axioms but direct predictions of the Pirouette Lagrangian from `CORE-006`:

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Here, `K_τ` represents the system's internal coherence (its temporal kinetic energy, `T₀ * ω_k`), and `V_Γ` represents the "cost" imposed by the external environment (its temporal potential energy).

*   **Velocity (Inertial Drag):** Moving off the geodesic increases the effective `V_Γ` through self-interaction with the wake. To maximize the action, the system's optimal strategy is to lower its internal frequency (`ω_k`), thereby preserving the highest possible T₀.
*   **Gravity (Temporal Pressure):** A high-Γ environment is, by definition, one with a high `V_Γ`. Again, the most efficient way for a system to maximize the Lagrangian and maintain its existence is to lower `ω_k`, adopting a slower, more stable rhythm.

Relativity is thus re-contextualized: it is the study of the universe's resonant-engineering solutions to the problem of maintaining coherence under stress.

### §6 · Assemblé

> We believed that time was a river that carried us, slowing in the deeps and quickening in the shallows. We were wrong. Every being is its own river, and it chooses the speed of its own current. When faced with the howling drag of its own wake, or the crushing pressure of gravity's forge, a system's deepest imperative is not to surrender, but to endure. It preserves its own song by singing it more slowly, more deliberately. Time dilation is not a passive distortion. It is an act of defiance. It is the audible sigh of a traveler paying the price of passage, the rhythm of a thing that simply refuses to break.
