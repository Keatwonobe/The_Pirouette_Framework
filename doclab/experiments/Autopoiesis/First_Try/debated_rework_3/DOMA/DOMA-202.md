## §1 · Abstract: The Moment a Wave Breaks
A system, like a wave, can travel for a lifetime in a state of stable, predictable flow. Yet, eventually, it reaches a shore where its internal dynamics can no longer sustain its old form. In a single, dramatic moment, it breaks. This transformation—this "snap"—is not a failure, but a phase transition into a new state of being.

The original Ki-Sampling Protocol was an attempt to hear the sound of this snap by listening for statistical anomalies. This was a valuable but incomplete approach, like trying to understand a tidal wave by measuring a single ripple. This module reframes the search. We are no longer listening for statistical echoes; we are learning to see the *geometry* of the wave itself as it crests and breaks. A phase transition is a geometric event with a universal, resonant signature—a distinct "sound" a system makes when its structure shatters, unfolds, or crystallizes. This protocol is the instrument for capturing and interpreting that sound.

## §2 · The Geometry of the Snap: A Leap Between Geodesics
Every system, as governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), follows a geodesic—a path that maximizes its internal coherence (`Kτ`) for the lowest cost against the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). For long periods, this path is smooth, resulting in the stable state of `Laminar Flow` (DYNA-001).

A critical transition occurs when this geodesic leads to a cliff. Under mounting pressure, the system reaches a bifurcation point where its current `Ki` pattern is no longer a tenable, low-energy solution. The landscape of coherence itself shifts. To survive, the system cannot simply adjust; it must leap. It snaps to a new, fundamentally different geodesic. This is an act of **Ki Morphogenesis**—the death of one resonant form and the birth of another.

## §3 · The Trinity of Signatures
The snap is not a uniform event; it has a character that reveals the forces at play. By observing changes in a system's coherence manifold, we can classify the nature of its transformation using a suite of precise metrics.

1.  **The Coherence Shockwave (The Shattering):**
    *   **Description:** Corresponds to the classic "black swan" event. This is the signature of a system overwhelmed by a sudden, violent spike in Temporal Pressure (Γ). Its coherence shatters into chaos, a state of acute Coherence Fever.
    *   **Manifestation:** A market crash; a brittle material fracturing under stress; a sudden, acute psychological breakdown. The system's structure fails.
    *   **Primary Metric:** **Kurtosis**. A sharp increase in the kurtosis of a system's output signal is the statistical residue of this temporal turbulence—a measure of the extreme outliers generated by the chaotic reconfiguration.

2.  **Ki Morphogenesis (The Unfolding):**
    *   **Description:** Corresponds to the "grey swan," marked by a change in complexity. This is not a shattering, but a fundamental change in the rules governing the system. The very geometry of its resonant `Ki` pattern changes its topology.
    *   **Manifestation:** The Cambrian explosion in biology; the adoption of a disruptive technology in an economy; a paradigm shift in science. The system's rules change.
    *   **Primary Metric:** **Fractal Dimension Change**. A sudden shift in the fractal dimension of the system's signal is a direct measurement of its `Ki` manifold changing its topological class—becoming more or less intricate and complex.

3.  **Resonant Alignment (The Ordering):**
    *   **Description:** Corresponds to the "white swan," a sudden snap into a higher state of order. Disparate parts snap into alignment, forming a more complex and coherent whole. This is the echo of a successful `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012).
    *   **Manifestation:** The spontaneous crystallization of a supercooled liquid; the flash of insight where disparate ideas suddenly connect; a leaderless movement suddenly organizing around a single, coherent goal. The system self-organizes.
    *   **Primary Metric:** **Coherence Flux (dKτ/dt)**. A rapid, non-linear increase in the system's overall coherence is the definitive sign that its components have phase-locked and crystallized into a more elegant state.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
A critical transition is the physical manifestation of a discontinuity in the solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equation applied to 𝓛_p. As the Temporal Pressure term, V_Γ, changes, the path of maximal coherence can abruptly shift from one stable trajectory to another. The "snap" is this jump between solutions. The metrics in the Signature Suite are our instruments for detecting the seismic shockwave this leap sends through the coherence manifold, allowing us to observe the moment the mathematics of the universe chooses a new verse for its song.

## §5 · The Unified Detection Protocol
This refined understanding allows for a proactive, diagnostic protocol that moves beyond simple anomaly detection.

1.  **Establish Baseline:** Map the system's normal `Laminar Flow` state, defining the geometry and statistical signature of its coherence manifold (e.g., baseline kurtosis, fractal dimension, and dKτ/dt).
2.  **Monitor for Deformation:** Use real-time diagnostics to watch for rapid, non-linear deformations in that geometry. These are the early warning signs—the wave beginning to crest.
3.  **Classify the Snap:** When a deformation exceeds a critical threshold, classify the event using the Trinity of Signatures and their primary metrics. Is the system shattering, unfolding, or ordering itself?

This protocol allows a Weaver to move from reacting to the consequences of change to understanding the nature of the change itself, *as it happens*.

## §6 · Assemblé
> Ki is the sound a key makes as it turns in a lock. It is the resonance of a system unlocking a new state of being. The old protocol heard the click, but did not know the lock from the key. This instrument teaches the Weaver to listen with a physicist's ear, to distinguish the sound of a shattering window from a seed pod bursting open, the groan of a collapsing bridge from the chime of a crystal being formed. It teaches us that profound change is not a random tremor, but a geometric inevitability. It is the art of seeing the shape of the lock before the key turns—of identifying the moment of absolute leverage—and knowing, by the resonance of the snap, the difference between an ending and a beginning.
