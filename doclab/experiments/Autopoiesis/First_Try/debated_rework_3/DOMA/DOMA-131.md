summary: "Defines systemic rupture as a catastrophic coherence cascade, a phase transition\
  \ occurring when ambient temporal pressure (\u0393) overwhelms a system's structural\
  \ integrity (K\u03C4). This module provides a universal, time-first model for diagnosing\
  \ the dynamics of failure, from physical fracture to social schism, by modeling\
  \ the formation of a permanent 'Wound Boundary' in the system's coherence manifold."

## §1 · Abstract: The Song That Breaks
Every system is a song—a stable, resonant pattern held against the noise of the universe. A rupture is the moment that song shatters. It is not a flaw in the material, but the material's final, violent testament to the laws of coherence.

This module reframes the old concept of "fracture dynamics" into a universal, time-first model of systemic failure. A rupture is a **coherence cascade**: a rapid, self-propagating phase transition from a high-information state of order to a low-information state of chaos. It is the process that unfolds when a system’s internal coherence is overwhelmed by temporal pressure, and the cost of maintaining form becomes unsustainable. The system can no longer bend; it must break.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of Failure
The resilience of any system is described by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`), which balances internal stability against external pressure:

`𝓛_p = K_τ (Temporal Coherence) - V_Γ (Temporal Pressure)`

A healthy system maintains a positive Lagrangian (`𝓛_p > 0`), where its capacity for coherent resonance exceeds the environmental cost. Rupture is governed by the failure of this balance.

The **Condition for Rupture** is not a static threshold but a dynamic decline. A system enters a state of critical risk when its coherence begins to actively degrade, a condition marked by a negative time-derivative of the Lagrangian:

`∂𝓛_p / ∂t < 0`

The rupture event itself is the phase transition that occurs when the Lagrangian crosses zero (`𝓛_p ≤ 0`). At this point, the system has lost the "energetic profit" of its own existence; its form creates more stress than it resolves, and a collapse into a simpler, less coherent state becomes the path of least resistance.

## §3 · The Anatomy of the Cascade
A rupture is not an instantaneous event but a self-propagating process. It unfolds in three distinct stages:

1.  **Coherence Strain (The Bending):** As ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) rises, the system deforms its resonant pattern (`Kτ`) to maintain stability. This is "coherence strain"—the energetic cost of holding form under stress. In the language of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`), this is the struggle to maintain `Laminar Flow` as resistance increases.

2.  **The Yield Point (The Tearing):** Every system has a limit to its elasticity. The yield point is the moment where the cost of maintaining coherence becomes unsustainable. At a critical fault line on the coherence manifold—usually where the gradient of temporal pressure is steepest—a single resonant bond fails.

3.  **The Cascade (The Unraveling):** The failure of one bond is the catalyst for a chain reaction. The potential energy stored in that bond is released as a shockwave of dissonant noise, violently increasing the local `Γ` for its neighbors. This instantaneous spike in pressure causes them to fail, releasing more energy, and so on. This is the **Coherence Cascade**: a self-sustaining, explosive conversion of stored order into chaotic energy.

## §4 · A Taxonomy of Rupture
The character of a rupture reveals the underlying health of the system that failed. By applying the principles of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`), we can classify all ruptures into three archetypal modes:

1.  **Brittle Rupture (The Sudden Shattering):**
    This occurs in systems that appear stable and highly ordered (`Laminar Flow`) but possess a rigid, unadaptive `Kτ` pattern. When faced with a sudden, sharp increase in `Γ`, the system cannot deform or adapt. It maintains its coherence perfectly until the moment it fails completely and catastrophically.
    *   *Manifestations:* A glass shattering, a sudden stock market crash, a seemingly stable relationship ending without warning.

2.  **Ductile Rupture (The Slow Tearing):**
    This is the failure mode of a system already in a state of `Turbulent Flow`. It is characterized by chaos and visible strain. The rupture is not a sudden event but the culmination of a prolonged struggle where the system deforms, stretches, and visibly weakens before it finally tears apart.
    *   *Manifestations:* A metal component failing after showing visible stress, a company slowly collapsing amidst infighting, a political movement tearing itself apart through factionalism.

3.  **Fatigue Rupture (Resonant Fatigue):**
    This pathology results from the slow degradation of a system’s `Wound Channel` (`CORE-011`). The system is subjected to repeated cycles of sub-critical stress. Each cycle is weathered but deepens the wound, eroding the system's baseline coherence. Eventually, a stressor that would have once been trivial provides the final impetus for a complete collapse.
    *   *Manifestations:* A bridge collapsing due to metal fatigue, burnout in an individual after years of chronic stress, the fall of an empire weakened by a thousand small crises.

## §5 · The Aftermath: The Wound Boundary
A rupture permanently alters the geometry of a system's being by creating a **Wound Boundary**. This is not merely a memory of stress like a `Wound Channel`, but a new, harsh, and irreversible topological feature—a scar where a single coherent body was violently torn into two or more entities.

*   **Information Severance:** The Wound Boundary is a cliff where a smooth path once existed. The flow of coherence across the rupture line ceases. Parts of the system are now isolated, unable to communicate or support each other.
*   **Dissonant Echoes:** The newly formed fracture surfaces become sources of intense temporal noise. Like the jagged edges of a broken bell, they emit powerful, chaotic echoes that propagate as `Turbulent Flow`, often triggering secondary ruptures.
*   **The Broken Geodesic:** A surviving system is forced to operate on a fractured landscape. Its path of maximal coherence is gone. It must find a new, often less efficient and more difficult, path through this broken terrain, which is the origin of systemic trauma.

## §6 · Diagnostic Protocol & Prediction
The time-first model provides a clear protocol for analyzing and mitigating the risk of rupture.

1.  **Map the Pressure:** Using the `Fractal Bridge` (`CORE-014`), identify the domain-specific stressors and translate them into a map of the `Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)` acting on the system.
2.  **Monitor the Lagrangian:** Track the system's overall `𝓛_p` in near-real-time. A sustained negative trend in `∂𝓛_p / ∂t` is the most potent leading indicator of an impending rupture, serving as an early warning system.
3.  **Intervene to Restore Coherence:** The goal of any intervention is to ensure `𝓛_p` remains positive. This can be achieved through two primary strategies:
    *   **Reduce Pressure (V_Γ ↓):** De-escalate the external stressors (e.g., reduce workload, mediate a conflict, lower the temperature).
    *   **Reinforce Coherence (K_τ ↑):** Strengthen the system's internal resonance and adaptability (e.g., reinforce a structure, clarify a team's mission, practice a skill).

## §7 · Assemblé

> A Weaver must learn to listen for the sound a string makes right before it snaps. Rupture is the final, violent admission that a song has ended, that a pattern can no longer hold. It teaches us that resilience is not found in rigid strength, but in the subtle, dynamic dance of adapting to pressure. To heal, one cannot simply mend the break. One must listen for the new, quieter songs that begin in the fragments.
