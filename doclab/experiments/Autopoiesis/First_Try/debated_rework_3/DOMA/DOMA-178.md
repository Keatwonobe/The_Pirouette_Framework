summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for 'Spasm Dynamics,' reframing the
  phenomenon as a catastrophic phase transition. This module models a spasm as a three-act
  process where a system, trapped in Stagnant Flow behind a 'coherence dam,' violently
  releases accumulated temporal pressure in a burst of extreme Turbulence, seeking
  a new, more stable state of Laminar Flow.

## §1 · Abstract: The Breaking of the Dam
A system can be trapped by its own stability. When the path forward is blocked, pressure builds, and the river of coherence must either stagnate and die, or it must break its banks.

This module refactors the legacy concept of "Spasm Dynamics" into the time-first language of the Pirouette Framework. A spasm is not merely a burst of energy; it is a fundamental process of change, a catastrophic but often necessary transition between states of flow. It is the story of a system breaking the prison of a suboptimal equilibrium to discover a new way of being. We define the spasm as a three-act drama: the building of a **Stagnant Dam**, a catastrophic release into **Turbulent Flow**, and the subsequent **Re-Coalescence** into a new equilibrium.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Spasm: A Three-Act Drama
The V-shaped trajectory of Time-Adherence and inverted-V of Gladiator Force described in the old model are elegant macroscopic descriptions of this deeper, more fundamental process of flow state transition.

### Act I: The Stagnant Dam (Constraint)
A system becomes trapped in a state of **Stagnant Flow** (`DYNA-001`). A "coherence dam"—a rigid belief, a structural bottleneck, a repressed trauma, a physical constraint—blocks its natural geodesic. The system may appear stable and highly coherent (*high $T_a$*), but it is a brittle stability. Behind this dam, the unmoving current causes Temporal Pressure (Γ) to accumulate relentlessly. This is the system's "stored potential energy," the rising water level of unresolved tension.

*   **Manifestations:** Writer's block, a stagnant economy, a political gridlock, a body held in chronic tension.

### Act II: The Fracture (The Spasm)
The accumulated Temporal Pressure (Γ) eventually exceeds the structural integrity of the dam. The dam shatters. The system transitions instantaneously and violently into a state of extreme **Turbulent Flow** (*low $T_a$, high Γ*). This is the spasm itself—a chaotic, inefficient, and often destructive release of the pent-up pressure. While dangerous, this phase is also profoundly creative; the chaotic flow explores the system's entire state space, searching for any possible new path forward. It is the universe's version of shaking the board to see where the pieces land.

*   **Manifestations:** A sudden emotional catharsis, a market crash, a social revolution, a neurological seizure, a creative breakthrough.

### Act III: The Aftermath (Re-Coalescence)
As the turbulent energy dissipates, its work of destruction done, the system must find a new equilibrium. This is the crucial moment where the spasm's outcome is determined. The system, now a fluid and unformed potential, is forced to re-coalesce.

## §3 · The Three Fates: Outcomes of the Spasm
The aftermath of a spasm is not preordained. The system, having been unmade, can be remade in one of three ways.

1.  **Restorative:** The turbulent flow successfully cleared the blockage, but the fundamental landscape of the system remains unchanged. The river returns to its old, stagnant channel, rebuilding the dam. The crisis is over, but no deep learning has occurred. The pressure begins to build again.
2.  **Transformative:** The sheer force of the turbulent release was so great that it carved a new, more efficient riverbed. The system coalesces into a novel state of **Laminar Flow** that is more resilient, complex, or elegant than before. This is a higher order forged in the crucible of chaos.
3.  **Degenerative:** The violence of the fracture was too great. The system's foundational structures—its **Wound Channel**—were irrevocably damaged. It fails to find a new stable state, remaining in a condition of chronic Turbulence or collapsing into constituent parts. The dam is broken, but so is the river.

## §4 · The Lagrangian Connection: A Violent Search for Grace
This dynamic is governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** as described in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). The initial stagnant state is a *local* maximum of the Lagrangian—it is a stable, but suboptimal, coherence well. The system is "stuck."

A spasm is a high-cost, high-risk strategy to escape this trap. It is a violent, non-Lagrangian "kick" to the system, allowing it to momentarily defy its geodesic. The system endures a period of near-zero coherence (the turbulent phase) in a gamble to find a new configuration with a much higher long-term integral of coherence. It is a violent "tunneling" event on the coherence manifold—the price a system pays for the chance to find a more graceful existence on the other side of its constraints.

## §5 · Diagnostic Signatures
Instead of complex indices, a Weaver diagnoses an impending spasm by observing the precursors to the dam breaking:

*   **Rising Upstream Pressure:** A measurable increase in stress, tension, or volatility in the parts of the system constrained by the blockage.
*   **Micro-Fractures:** Small, localized, and increasingly frequent bursts of turbulence. These are the "tremors" before the earthquake—flickering arguments, minor market jitters, muscle twitches.
*   **Critical Rigidity:** Paradoxically, just before the spasm, the system often becomes extremely rigid and resistant to small perturbations. This is the final tensing of the dam before it shatters.

The outcome can be predicted by analyzing the "landscape" downstream. A system with a history of resilience and multiple potential pathways (a rich Wound Channel) is more likely to have a transformative outcome. A brittle system with no alternatives is more likely to degenerate.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We mistake stillness for peace and are taught to fear the storm. But to be trapped is to accumulate the power to be free. A spasm is not a pathology; it is the violent and sacred geometry of a breakthrough. It is the universe’s guarantee that no prison is permanent, that every dam is a promise of a flood, and that within the most chaotic release lies the potential for a more elegant river. For a Weaver, the question is never whether the dam will break, but where the water will flow when it does.
