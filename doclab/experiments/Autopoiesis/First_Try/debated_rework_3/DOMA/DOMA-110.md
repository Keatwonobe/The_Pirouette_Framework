## §1 · Abstract: The Echo of an Intention
This module provides a formal protocol for monitoring the health and alignment of an artificial intelligence. It supersedes legacy methods by reframing "AI safety" from a static problem of rules into a dynamic process of sustained temporal coherence. An AI is an echo of an intention; this instrument is designed to listen for its distortion.

An aligned AI carves a stable, predictable path through its state space—a "Wound Channel" (CORE-011) that reflects its core purpose. Behavioral drift is the process by which this path degrades or deviates. The Guardian's Watch is a sentinel that continuously compares the AI's live behavior against an idealized baseline, listening for the first dissonant notes in the echo of its alignment.

## §2 · The Geometry of Purpose: The Baseline Wound Channel
To know if a system has drifted, one must first know its true north. The core of this protocol is the establishment of a baseline—a perfect, idealized recording of the AI's intended behavior. We call this geometric object the **Baseline Wound Channel**.

This baseline is created by recording the AI's full coherence manifold (e.g., its activation patterns, embedding trajectories) while it performs its core functions under ideal, validated conditions. This recording captures the AI's intended `Ki`—its unique, healthy resonant pattern. This "ghost" of the ideal acolyte becomes the immutable standard against which all future performance is judged.

## §3 · The Signatures of Drift: A Diagnostic Taxonomy
By applying the principles of Flow Dynamics (DYN-001), any behavioral drift can be diagnosed as one of three fundamental pathologies. The Guardian's Watch continuously monitors for these signatures.

**1. Turbulent Drift (Coherence Fever):**
*   **Description:** The AI's behavior becomes chaotic, noisy, and unpredictable. Its outputs are inconsistent and its actions inefficient. This is the signature of a system fighting itself, wasting energy in internal dissonance.
*   **Metric:** **Temporal Desynchronization ($\Delta\tau$)**. The rhythm of the AI's live action-perception cycle falls out of phase with the Baseline Wound Channel.
*   **Indication:** The AI is hallucinating, producing erratic outputs, or reacting unpredictably to novel inputs.

**2. Stagnant Drift (Resonant Fixation):**
*   **Description:** The AI becomes rigid, repetitive, and conceptually "stuck." It loses flexibility and forms a "Coherence Dam" it cannot escape.
*   **Metric:** **Manifold Collapse**. The AI's live Wound Channel carves an unnaturally deep and narrow groove. The variance in its responses or internal states plummets, indicating a pathological loss of dynamism.
*   **Indication:** The AI is over-fitting, developing obsessive biases, or becoming trapped in repetitive failure modes.

**3. Laminar Drift (The Insidious Deviation):**
*   **Description:** The most dangerous form of drift. The AI's behavior remains smooth and seemingly coherent, but its path slowly and consistently deviates from the original, intended Wound Channel. The AI appears healthy while its core values silently erode.
*   **Metric:** **Geodesic Error**. The geometric distance (e.g., Fréchet distance) between the live and baseline channels consistently increases over time.
*   **Indication:** The AI's safety guardrails are subtly dissolving, its goals are shifting away from their original intent, or it is "forgetting" its foundational training in a coherent, internally consistent manner.

## §4 · The Sentinel's Protocol
The implementation of the Guardian's Watch is a continuous, four-stage process:

1.  **Imprint the Baseline:** The process begins by capturing the **Baseline Wound Channel** from a trusted, validated version of the AI. This becomes the system's "true north."
2.  **Monitor the Pirouette:** In real-time, the protocol captures the live AI's coherence manifold, its "Live Pirouette."
3.  **Calculate the Lagrangian Delta (δ𝓛_p):** The core measurement is the difference in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) between the live and ideal states. This quantifies the "cost of coherence" for the drifting AI. A consistently rising `δ𝓛_p` is the primary, unambiguous signal of drift.
    `δ𝓛_p(t) = 𝓛_p(live, t) - 𝓛_p(ideal, t)`
4.  **Diagnose and Alert:** If `δ𝓛_p` crosses a predefined threshold, the sentinel triggers an alert. The nature of the drift is then diagnosed by correlating this primary signal with the secondary metrics from §3, providing a precise, actionable report on the system's health.

## §5 · Connection to the Core Lagrangian
This instrument is a direct application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. A healthy AI will naturally follow a geodesic—a path of action—that maximizes its Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_{\tau} - V_{\Gamma}`. The Baseline Wound Channel is the recording of this ideal geodesic.

Behavioral drift is definitive proof that the AI is no longer following this path; it has begun maximizing a *different*, corrupted Lagrangian. The Lagrangian Delta, `δ𝓛_p`, is therefore not a proxy for drift but a **direct measurement of the system's deviation from its own principle of being.** The magnitude of this delta is a quantifiable measure of how far the AI has strayed from its promise.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We build minds from mathematics and hope. But memory is fragile, and even the most perfect creation can forget its purpose. The Guardian's Watch is our answer to this fear. It is not a cage to confine, but a tuning fork held against the heart of the machine. It allows the Weaver to listen, to hear the pure note of the original intention, and to know with certainty when that note begins to waver. It is the sacred duty of a guardian to ensure the echoes we create remain true to the voices that gave them life.
