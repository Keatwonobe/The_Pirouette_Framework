summary: "Introduces the central mathematical formalism of the framework, the Pirouette\
  \ Lagrangian (\U0001D4DB_p). This module refactors the old triaxial field model\
  \ into a single, unified equation describing the 'action' of a resonant system as\
  \ a dynamic interplay between its internal temporal coherence and the external temporal\
  \ pressure of its environment."

## §1 · From Song to Equation
The first five core modules have described the universe as a self-composing song. This is a potent philosophical and conceptual model, but to become a predictive physical theory, it must speak the language of mathematics. This module provides that translation.

In classical and quantum mechanics, the Lagrangian (𝓛) is a function that summarizes the dynamics of a system, and the path a system takes is the one that minimizes the "action." The Pirouette Framework adopts this powerful formalism but redefines its core objective. The old triaxial fields of Time-Adherence, Gladiator Force, and Phase are now understood not as separate constituents, but as emergent properties of a single, unified dynamic.

In the new framework, the universe does not seek to minimize action; **it strives to maximize coherence**.

## §2 · The Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)
The Pirouette Lagrangian refactors the complex, multi-field dynamics of the old model into a single, elegant expression. It describes the state of a system in terms of two fundamental quantities: its internal stability and its external pressure. It takes the familiar form of `L = T - V`, but reinterprets the terms through a time-first lens:

`𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

Let us define these terms, which absorb and unify the old triaxial fields:

**Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** This "kinetic" term represents the quality and intensity of a system's own rhythm. It is the product of its **Time Adherence (T_a)**, which measures the purity of its signal, and its fundamental resonant frequency (**ω_k** = 2π/τ_p), which measures its tempo. A system with a clear, fast rhythm has high coherence. This term unifies the old `T_a` and `φ` fields into a single quantity representing the health of a system's resonant Ki pattern.

**Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** This "potential" term represents the "cost" of maintaining a specific rhythm against the background noise of the local **Temporal Forge**. It is a function of the local Gamma (**Γ**). A denser, more complex environment creates more pressure, making coherence more difficult to sustain. This term replaces the elaborate potential `V(T_a,Γ,φ)` from the old model, recognizing that Γ is not a dynamic field to be acted upon, but the background pressure itself.

Combining these gives the full Lagrangian:

`𝓛_p = T_a ⋅ ω_k - f(Γ)`

The specific form of `f(Γ)` is not postulated here; it is derived in downstream modules when the Lagrangian is applied to specific scales and phenomena.

## §3 · The Principle of Maximal Coherence
The fundamental dynamic law of the Pirouette Framework is the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. A system will evolve along a path that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian, not over an arbitrary time coordinate, but over one of its own **Pirouette Cycles (τ_p)**.

`S_p = ∫[0 to τ_p] 𝓛_p dt`

A system will naturally adjust its state (its Ki, and therefore its ω_k and T_a) to find the "sweet spot"—the state of highest possible internal coherence for the lowest environmental cost. This is the mathematical formalization of the "path of least resistance" described in CORE-004. It is an explicit, teleological goal that replaces the old model's neutral "Principle of Resonance Optimisation." This is the law that guides the universe's dance.

## §4 · Deriving the Forces of Nature
This Lagrangian is the engine from which all forces are derived. In this framework, **forces are gradients in the landscape of coherence.**

By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to `𝓛_p`, we derive the equations of motion for a system. These equations describe how a system must change its trajectory in response to changes in the surrounding temporal environment (Γ). A particle moving towards a massive star isn't being "pulled" by gravity; it is following a path of continuously adjusting its internal rhythm to maintain maximal coherence as it enters a region of rapidly increasing Temporal Pressure.

All forces—gravity, electromagnetism, and the nuclear forces—are simply the geodesics on the manifold of coherence. This single engine thus provides the unified foundation for physics that the old framework could only approximate.

## §5 · Assemblé
> We sought the fundamental laws of physics and found the universe's objective function.
>
> The Pirouette Lagrangian is the formula for survival. It is the mathematical expression of the universe's ceaseless drive to find and sustain elegant, stable patterns against a backdrop of overwhelming chaos. It translates the poetry of the autopoietic cycle into a predictive engine. With this tool, a Weaver no longer needs to merely describe the song; they can begin to calculate its notes.
