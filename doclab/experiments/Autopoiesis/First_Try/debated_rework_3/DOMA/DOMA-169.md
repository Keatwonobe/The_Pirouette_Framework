summary: Provides a time-first model for systemic recovery after collapse. This module
  defines the phases of recovery (Latency, Acceleration, Stabilization) and reframes
  'rebound' as a system's search for a new, stable resonant pattern (Ki). This search
  is guided by the geometric memory of its Wound Channel and classifies recovery types
  (Restorative, Adaptive, Transformative) as distinct strategies for navigating a
  changed coherence manifold.

## §1 · Abstract: The Song After the Silence
A system's collapse is the shattering of its song. The silence that follows is not an ending, but a question. This module reframes the phenomenon of "rebound" from a mechanical response into a profound act of re-creation. Recovery is the process by which a system, thrown into the chaos of the Temporal Forge, navigates the landscape of possibility to find a new rhythm. It is guided by the ghost of its past—the geometric memory of its Wound Channel—but its destination is not preordained. It is a dynamic search for the most coherent new song it can sing in the world that now is.

## §2 · The Anatomy of Collapse: From Laminar to Turbulent
In the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), a healthy system exists in a state of **Laminar Flow**. Its internal resonant pattern (Ki) is stable, and its Temporal Coherence (Kτ) is high. It moves efficiently along its geodesic on the coherence manifold.

Collapse is a catastrophic phase transition into **Turbulent Flow**. It is triggered by an overwhelming spike in local Temporal Pressure (Γ)—a physical shock, a market crash, a psychological trauma. This dissonance shatters the system's Ki, causing its Temporal Coherence to plummet. The system is thrown from its path, its energy now wasted in chaotic, internal friction. The river has breached its banks and become a churning flood.

## §3 · The Temporal Phases of Recovery: A Three-Act Search
The process of re-establishing Laminar Flow unfolds in three distinct temporal phases, regardless of the ultimate outcome.

1.  **Latency (The Quiet Search):** In the immediate aftermath, the system's coherence is shattered. Its internal Ki pattern is chaotic, its echoes scattered. There is little outward change, but a profound internal search is underway. The system is probing the contours of the new, scarred coherence manifold, feeling for a stable gradient—a viable path forward.

2.  **Acceleration (Carving the New Riverbed):** A path of sufficient coherence is found. The system commits its energy and begins to move, rapidly carving a new channel. This is the phase of exponential recovery, where coherence is rebuilt and a new, stable pattern begins to emerge. The system is not just moving; it is actively reshaping its landscape through its motion.

3.  **Stabilization (The Settling Echoes):** The new Laminar Flow is established. The system settles into its new equilibrium, but the echoes of the transition remain. It may oscillate or "ring" around its new stable state, like a struck bell finding its fundamental note. These are the settling dynamics as the new Wound Channel solidifies and the memory of the trauma is integrated into the system's identity.

## §4 · The Geometries of Rebound: Three Paths to Coherence
The final form of the recovery is determined by the interplay between the residual geometry of the system's Wound Channel (CORE-011) and the new environmental pressures. This leads to one of three possible outcomes.

### I. Restorative Recovery: The Echo's Return
If the post-collapse environment is similar to the old one and the system's Wound Channel is deep and clear, the path of least resistance is to return to the original song. The Wound Channel acts as a powerful geometric attractor, and the system "snaps back" into its old Ki pattern, re-carving the familiar riverbed. This is the resilience of a bent branch straightening.

### II. Adaptive Recovery: The River's New Course
Often, the landscape is permanently altered, and the old path is no longer the most efficient. Here, the system uses its old Wound Channel as a guide, not a destination. It latches onto the familiar echo but modifies its Ki pattern to find a more stable resonance in the new environment. It carves a new channel adjacent to the old one. This is the resilience of a river finding a more efficient course around a new obstacle.

### III. Transformative Recovery: The Alchemical Forge
Sometimes the collapse is so total that the old Wound Channel is a useless guide. The system cannot return; it must become something entirely new. The shattered fragments of the old system undergo an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012), fusing into a novel, higher-order entity with a completely new Ki. This is post-traumatic growth, the resilience of the forest that grows back stronger and more diverse after a fire.

## §5 · The Lagrangian of Resilience
This entire process is governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). A system in recovery is not acting randomly; it is relentlessly solving for the state that maximizes its coherence integral (`S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`).

The choice between Restorative, Adaptive, and Transformative paths is not a choice at all; it is the inevitable outcome of the system following its new geodesic toward a new peak on the coherence manifold. The "overshoot" dynamics observed during the Stabilization phase are the physical manifestation of the system oscillating as it settles into the basin of attraction for its new, stable resonance. Resilience, therefore, is not a measure of a system's ability to resist change, but a measure of its efficiency in finding its new path of maximal coherence after a disruption.

## §6 · Assemblé
> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver? Because it teaches us that a scar is a map. A collapse is not an ending; it is a question posed in the language of chaos. Resilience is the elegance of the answer. It is the universe's profound assertion that even in the face of dissolution, the drive to find a new and coherent song is the most fundamental law of all. A Weaver does not fear the flood; they learn to read the new landscape it leaves behind, knowing that the most beautiful rivers are often those that have been forced to find a new way home.
