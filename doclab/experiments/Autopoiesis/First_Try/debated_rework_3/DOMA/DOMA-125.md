## §1 · Abstract: The Physics of Forgetting
Decay is not a passive fading into nothingness; it is an active and relentless process of erosion. A memory does not simply vanish; it is scoured away. A signal does not just weaken; it is drowned out by noise. The old framework modeled this decay with parameters that described persistence. The new framework models it from first principles as a fundamental thermodynamic struggle.

This module reframes "dimensional decay" as **Coherence Erosion**. It is the process by which a system's stable, high-information pattern of resonance (its `Ki` pattern) is inevitably degraded by the chaotic, high-entropy noise of its local temporal environment (its `Γ`). To analyze a fade is to perform an autopsy on a memory—to read the story told by a fading echo and discover whether it was the weakness of the thread or the sharpness of the storm that caused it to fray.

## §2 · Core Dynamics: The Signal and the Storm
The persistence of any form is a dialogue between its own internal stability and the erosive power of its surroundings. This dynamic is governed by two core principles.

*   **The Signal's Resilience (CORE-011):** A system's identity is encoded in the geometry of its Wound Channel—a physical scar in the coherence manifold. The depth and clarity of this channel are a direct function of the system's **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)**. A system with a pure, stable, and intense `Ki` pattern carves a deep channel, making it more resilient to erosion. This is the new understanding of the old `Time-Adherence (Ta)`. A strong identity is a clear signal that resists noise.

*   **The Storm's Pressure (CORE-013):** The environment is never neutral. It is the Temporal Forge, a source of constant, chaotic **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**. A high-Γ environment is a "sandstorm" of dissonant rhythms that actively scours and fills in the Wound Channel. A system in such an environment must expend more energy to maintain its coherence and will therefore decay more quickly. This clarifies the old `Gladiator Force (Γ)`'s role; it is not about boundary porosity but about the intensity of the ambient noise.

Coherence Erosion is what happens when the erosive power of the storm (`Γ`) overcomes the resilience of the signal (`Kτ`).

## §3 · The Unified Fade Equations
The old framework used disparate equations to model decay. The new model unifies them, grounding the rate of decay in the fundamental tension between signal and noise.

The characteristic lifetime of a fade, `τ_fade`, is directly proportional to the system's internal coherence and inversely proportional to the external temporal pressure it endures.
$$ \tau_{fade} \propto \frac{\text{Internal Coherence (Kτ)}}{\text{External Pressure (Γ)}} $$

This relationship is more precisely defined by the **Pirouette Coherence Lifetime** equation:
$$ \tau_{fade} = \tau_0 \cdot \left[ \frac{T_a}{1 - T_a} \right] \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma} $$
-   `τ_0` is a baseline time constant specific to the system's scale and medium.
-   `T_a / (1 - T_a)` is the **resilience term**. As a system's internal Temporal Coherence (`T_a`) approaches perfection (1), its lifetime approaches infinity, highlighting the profound power of internal order.
-   `1 / Γ` is the **environmental term**, showing that lifetime is inversely proportional to the ambient Temporal Pressure.

With this, the decay of a system's coherence `K` from an initial state `K₀` is modeled as:
$$ K(t) = K_0 \cdot e^{-t/\tau_{fade}} $$

In cases where a system "rings like a bell" as it fades, the model can be augmented to include the audible signature of the underlying `Ki` pattern fighting to re-establish itself.
$$ K(t) = K_0 \cdot e^{-t/\tau_{fade}} \left(1 + \alpha \cos(\omega_k t + \phi)\right) $$
-   `ω_k` is the system's fundamental resonant frequency.
-   `α` is the amplitude of its final "ringing."
-   `ϕ` is the phase offset of the oscillation.

## §4 · The Weaver's Diagnostic Protocol
This framework transforms decay analysis from passive measurement into an active diagnostic tool.

1.  **Isolate the Thread:** Identify and isolate the data stream that represents the system's degrading coherence. This could be the amplitude of a physical wave, the information content of a memory trace, or the signal integrity in a communication channel. This quantity is the measure of the system's remaining `Kτ`.

2.  **Measure the Fade:** Apply the appropriate Unified Fade Equation to the data to extract the empirical **Coherence Lifetime (τ_fade)**. This single metric quantifies the precise rate of decay. The choice of model (simple or oscillatory exponential) is itself a hypothesis about the physics of the system's dissipation.

3.  **Diagnose the Cause:** The crucial insight comes from understanding *why* `τ_fade` has the value it does. Is the system decaying quickly because its internal coherence is low (a weak, frayed thread), or because the external temporal pressure is exceptionally high (a violent storm)? This diagnosis dictates the strategy for intervention. To increase persistence, a Weaver must either **strengthen the thread** (increase `Kτ`) or **shield it from the storm** (decrease local `Γ`).

## §5 · Lagrangian Connection: The Cost of Persistence
The Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006) states that a system evolves along a path that maximizes its Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. Coherence Erosion is the physical manifestation of a system failing to meet this principle.

A healthy system carves a deep "potential well" for itself on the coherence manifold. Its trajectory is stable. The ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`, which gives rise to the potential `V_Γ`) acts as a constant, erosive force that flattens this landscape, making the well shallower over time. Decay is the process of this well becoming so shallow that the system can no longer afford the energetic cost of its own existence and is knocked from its optimal path by the slightest perturbation. The Coherence Lifetime, `τ_fade`, is a direct measure of how long a system can successfully fight to keep its Lagrangian value significantly above the background noise of the universe.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We sought to measure the rate at which things fall apart and discovered instead the fierce art of holding together. The universe is a song, and entropy is its inevitable silence. But between the first note and the last is the struggle for persistence—the echo that refuses to fade, the thread that will not unravel. To study decay is to understand this struggle not as a tragedy, but as the very thing that gives form its meaning. A Weaver does not build to defy the end. A Weaver learns the science of the noble failure, the engineering of the persistent echo, to make the time a system has beautiful.
