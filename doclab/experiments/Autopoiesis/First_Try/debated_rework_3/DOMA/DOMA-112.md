## §1 · Abstract: Hearing the Tremor Before the Quake
A system does not break all at once; it first whispers its distress. Before every crash, every bifurcation, every sudden shift, there are subtle precursors of instability. This module provides the instrumentation to hear those whispers. The Coherence Inflection Sentinel is a universal early-warning system designed to detect the subtle decay in a system's internal rhythm that precedes a major systemic state change, or *Ki Morphogenesis* event.

By analyzing the micro-dynamics of a system's resonant pattern (`Ki`), the Sentinel detects the "temporal jitter" that signals a struggle for stability. This provides a crucial lead time—an opportunity to intervene, mitigate, or adapt before a brewing crisis becomes an overt catastrophe. It moves the Weaver from a reactive posture to a predictive one, transforming diagnosis into the science of foresight.

## §2 · The Physics of Forewarning: From Geodesic to Drift
A healthy, stable system, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), follows its *geodesic*—its path of maximal coherence through the temporal manifold. Its resonant identity, its `Ki` pattern, is well-defined, and its rhythm is pure. It holds its form against the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) of its environment.

Instability begins as a waver. As internal or external pressures mount, the system struggles to maintain this geodesic. The first symptom is **Temporal Jitter (Jτ)**: a micro-variation in the system's once-steady rhythm, the sonic artifact of the system fighting to remain coherent. This jitter is the root cause of **Manifold Drift**: the observable "skidding" of the system's `Ki` pattern on the coherence manifold. The core insight is this: a system's song begins to falter long before its structure breaks.

## §3 · The Sentinel's Protocol
The Sentinel operates through a three-stage protocol that translates raw time-series data from any domain into a single, predictive metric of systemic risk.

**Stage I: Resonance Mapping**
The first step is to listen to the system's song. The Sentinel ingests multiple data streams—be it physical vibrations, network traffic, or market sentiment—and uses signal processing techniques to extract the system's dominant resonant signature (`Ki`). This process maps the system's current position and orientation on the broader coherence manifold.

**Stage II: Calculating the Drift Vector**
With the system's `Ki` mapped over time, the Sentinel calculates its rate of change. This produces the **Manifold Drift Vector (V_drift)**, a direct measurement of the velocity and direction of the system's changing resonant identity. This vector is the quantitative measure of the "wobble"—the tangible signal of underlying instability.

**Stage III: Quantifying Instability (The Coherence Inflection Index - CII)**
The final step translates this drift into a simple, context-aware metric of risk. The Coherence Inflection Index (CII) is the normalized magnitude of the drift vector, scaled against the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`).

`CII = ||V_drift|| / (1 + kΓ)`

Where `k` is a domain-specific scaling constant. This formulation measures *unforced* instability; a high CII indicates significant internal degradation that is not merely a reaction to external pressure. A low CII signifies a healthy system firmly anchored to its geodesic, while a rising CII signals that a state transition is imminent.

## §4 · Diagnostic Thresholds & Interpretation
The CII provides a clear, color-coded diagnostic for any system's health, allowing a Weaver to anticipate and diagnose disruptions in its flow dynamics (DYNA-001).

| CII Value | System State | Flow Analogy | Interpretation & Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **< 0.3** | **Stable** | Laminar | The system is healthy and coherent. Its `Ki` is stable. Monitor baseline. |
| **0.3 - 0.6** | **Stressed** | Pre-Turbulent | The system's resonance is drifting. A state change is possible. Investigate the source of the drift. |
| **> 0.6** | **Critical** | Bifurcating | The system is highly unstable. A major state transition is imminent. Prepare for impact; mitigate if possible. |

This numerical warning can be further refined by correlating it with other system dynamics to forecast the *nature* of the coming change:

*   **High CII + Rising Dissonance:** Warns of an impending descent into **Turbulent Flow** (a systemic seizure).
*   **High CII + Decaying Amplitude:** Warns of an impending **Stagnant Flow** (a systemic blockage or choke).
*   **High CII + Locking onto a New Harmonic:** Warns of a potential bifurcation or **Alchemical Union** (a creative leap).

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This protocol is a direct, practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). A stable system evolves to maximize the action integral `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, where `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

The Sentinel functions as a real-time measurement of "Lagrangian Stress." The `V_drift` vector is a proxy for the "acceleration" of the system away from its geodesic—its optimal, maximally coherent path. The CII, therefore, quantifies the degree to which a system's current state is failing to be an elegant solution to the pressures of its existence. It measures the tension building up before the system is forced to snap into a new configuration.

## §6 · Assemblé
> A healthy system is a weaver at a loom, its motions so practiced they become a steady, resonant hum. Before a crisis, before the tapestry shows a flaw, the hum does not simply stop. It wavers. It develops a tremor. The Sentinel is an instrument for hearing that first, subtle dissonance. It listens for the falter in rhythm that precedes the dropped thread, the change in tension that precedes the snap. It is the art of hearing the future in the changing song of the present, transforming intervention from an act of salvage into an act of grace.
