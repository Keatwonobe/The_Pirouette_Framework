## §1 · The Tuning Fork of Perception
This module refactors the concept of a "glossary" from a static reference into a dynamic, foundational instrument. A living framework requires a living language. The Weaver's Lexicon is an autopoietic (self-creating and maintaining) system designed not merely to define, but to *tune*—to align the internal coherence manifold of a Weaver with the core resonant patterns of the framework itself.

Language is the first and most fundamental instrument of creation. It shapes the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) before any other tool is lifted. A shared, precise, and coherent lexicon is therefore the precondition for any meaningful work, ensuring that all collaborative acts of weaving begin from a state of harmonic resonance.

## §2 · Language as a Coherence Field
A framework is not built from principles, but from the shared understanding of those principles. Language is the medium of that understanding, and like any medium, it can be laminar, turbulent, or stagnant. The Lexicon is the primary instrument for achieving **semantic coherence**: a state where the core concepts of the framework resonate with the same `Ki` pattern across multiple minds.

A precise vocabulary casts a precise shadow. When a Weaver uses the term "Temporal Pressure (Γ)," they are not just naming a concept; they are invoking a specific geometric lens through which to view a system's challenges. This sharpens observation, transforming vague feelings of "stress" or "chaos" into a measurable pressure that can be navigated. This shared calibration is the absolute prerequisite for Laminar Flow in discourse, transforming a cacophony of individual perspectives into a choir.

## §3 · The Autopoietic Lexicon Engine
To ensure its integrity and purity, the Lexicon flows from a **Principle of the Single Source**. It is not manually curated but is generated from a single, version-controlled registry of concepts by a self-maintaining process. This engine ensures the Lexicon has perfect Time Adherence—its definition of the framework is always true and current.

The engine's workflow is threefold:
1.  **Ingestion:** The Engine traverses the entire corpus of ratified modules to identify and extract foundational terms.
2.  **Distillation:** For each term, it distills the formal definition and its Correspondence Protocol.
3.  **Synthesis:** The Engine weaves these distilled concepts into multiple synchronized artifacts, each designed for a specific mode of use.

```

This autopoietic cycle guarantees that the framework's language remains a high-coherence instrument, free from the dissonance of outdated or conflicting definitions.

## §4 · The Artifacts of Coherence
The Lexicon Engine produces three synchronized instruments designed to facilitate laminar flow in thought and discourse.

**I. The Scroll of Principles (The Glossary)**
A comprehensive markdown document, organized thematically around the core autopoietic cycle. It provides the full definition and Correspondence Protocol for every term, serving as the definitive reference for deep study.

**II. The Compass of Dynamics (The Visual Guide)**
A high-level visual aid that replaces the obsolete triaxial *Mandala*. It depicts the central Pirouette Cycle (Time → Γ → Ki → Time) and maps the most critical concepts onto this dynamic flow. It is a tool for orientation, allowing a Weaver to instantly locate any concept within the framework's foundational engine.

**III. The Whisper of Insight (The IDE Integration)**
A lightweight JSON file designed to be consumed by development environments and other digital tools. It provides instant, on-hover definitions, weaving the Lexicon directly into the Weaver's workflow. It reduces the friction of context-switching, acting as a whisper of clarity exactly when and where it is needed.

## §5 · The Anatomy of a Term: The Correspondence Protocol
Each entry in the Lexicon is a complete tool for thought and application. It consists of two parts:

1.  **The Definition:** A concise, time-first explanation of the concept, grounded in the core autopoietic cycle.
2.  **The Correspondence Protocol:** The evolution of the "operational cue." It is a single, potent question that acts as a universal lens. By asking this question of any system, a Weaver can pinpoint the specific manifestation of the universal concept, bridging theory to practice.

The following is a representative sample:

*   **Term:** Temporal Pressure (Γ)
    *   **Definition:** The measure of the complexity, density, and dissonance of interfering temporal rhythms in a given region of spacetime. It is the ambient chaos against which a system must maintain its form.
    *   **Correspondence Protocol:** Ask: *What is the ambient, chaotic pressure the system must resist or resolve to survive?*

*   **Term:** Temporal Resonance (Ki)
    *   **Definition:** The specific, stable, and efficient geometric pattern of resonance a system manifests to persist within a given Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the system's unique note in the song of existence.
    *   **Correspondence Protocol:** Ask: *What is the stable, repeating pattern of identity that defines this system's "self"?*

*   **Term:** Alchemical Union
    *   **Definition:** The non-linear process by which two or more resonant systems merge under pressure to form a single, higher-order entity with a unified and more complex coherence manifold.
    *   **Correspondence Protocol:** Ask: *What is the process of synthesis that allows separate parts to become a new, more coherent whole?*

## §6 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The Lexicon is a direct, practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`). The terms defined here are the human-readable symbols that map directly onto this central equation.

*   **Minimizing Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** Misunderstanding and ambiguity are forms of communicative friction that increase the Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) on a collective. The Lexicon minimizes this pressure by providing a shared, stable language, allowing the group to follow its geodesic with the least resistance.

*   **Maximizing Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** A community's collective Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`) is its ability to think and create together. The Lexicon is the primary instrument for calibrating a Weaver's senses to perceive the forces of the Lagrangian, ensuring that the fundamental concepts are stable and shared, thereby maximizing `K_τ`.

Without this lexicon, the Lagrangian is a silent engine. With it, we can speak its name and purpose.

## §7 · Assemblé
> We sought a dictionary and found a book of spells. Each word, spoken with understanding, does not describe the world—it tunes it. The Lexicon is not a map of the song; it is the instrument upon which the song is learned, the tuning fork that brings the Weaver's own mind into harmony with the resonant truths of the Pirouette.
