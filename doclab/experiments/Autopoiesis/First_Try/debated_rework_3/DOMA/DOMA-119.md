summary: Defines the fundamental mechanics of influence, or 'Coherence Transfer,'
  between distinct systems. It reframes 'cross-domain bleed' as the process by which
  a system's resonant echo propagates across a shared medium, forming a bridge that
  imprints upon and alters the coherence manifold of a receiving system. This provides
  a time-first physical basis for communication, empathy, and memetics.

## §1 · The Myth of the Island
No system is an island, entire of itself; every system is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. The most persistent illusion of perception is the boundary. We see islands in the sea, convinced they are separate, and forget they are all peaks of a single, vast mountain range hidden in the deep.

The old framework spoke of "cross-domain bleed," a term suggesting an uncontrolled leak across conceptual walls. The modern, time-first understanding reveals a more profound truth: there are no walls. There is only a shared medium, a symphony of overlapping echoes. This module describes the **Resonant Bridge**: the universal process of **Coherence Transfer**, by which the echo of one system becomes the music, or the noise, of another.

## §2 · The Anatomy of Transfer
For the echo of one system (the Source) to influence another (the Target), a three-part process must unfold, propagating through the shared medium of spacetime.

1.  **Emission (The Signal):** The strength and clarity of the outbound signal are determined by the Source's own internal coherence (`K_τ`). A system with a powerful, stable Ki pattern—a mind with a clear conviction, a star with a steady burn—emits a potent and well-defined echo from its Wound Channel (CORE-011). A weak, chaotic system emits only noise.

2.  **Propagation (The Medium):** The echo does not travel through a void but through the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) that fills the space between systems. This intervening medium's state defines the **Boundary Permeability**.
    *   **Low, Quiescent Γ** acts like still air, allowing the resonant echo to travel with high fidelity.
    *   **High, Turbulent Γ** acts like a storm, scattering and corrupting the signal, localizing influence.

3.  **Reception (The Resonant Handshake):** The Target system is not a passive recipient. It must be "tuned" to the Source's frequency. This is the principle of **Harmonic Compatibility**, a precursor to the Alchemical Union (CORE-012). If the Source's echo is harmonically related to the Target's own Ki, the Target's coherence manifold will readily accept and amplify the imprint. If they are dissonant, the echo is reflected or ignored.

## §3 · The Mechanism: A Lagrangian Perspective
Coherence Transfer is a physical act of reshaping reality, governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The process unfolds as follows:

1.  **Propagation:** The echo of the Source's Ki pattern propagates from its Wound Channel as a ripple in the fabric of spacetime.
2.  **Imprinting:** When this ripple encounters a harmonically compatible Target, it imprints itself as a transient, geometric stress upon the Target's own coherence manifold.
3.  **Geodesic Deflection:** This new geometric feature alters the shape of the Target's landscape of possibility. The Target's "path of least resistance"—its geodesic of maximal coherence—is now subtly or significantly deflected.

The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, provides the precise mathematical description. The act of Coherence Transfer manifests as an external modification to the Target's potential term (`V_Γ`).

The Target's Lagrangian becomes:

`𝓛_p(Target) = K_τ(Target) - [V_Γ(local) + V_echo(Source)]`

The term `V_echo(Source)` represents the pressure exerted by the imprinted echo. This additional potential "cost" forces the Target system to re-solve for its optimal state. Influence is thus an act of energetic optimization: the Target does not choose to be influenced; it simply follows the newest, most coherent path now available to it.

## §4 · The Spectrum of Influence
The old framework's "Bleed Vectors" are now understood as symptoms of a single cause, whose effects vary based on the intensity and information content of the resonant echo. This creates a spectrum of influence.

*   **Attention Capture:** A strong, simple echo momentarily disrupts the Target's Ki, drawing its focus. It is the ringing of a bell. In the Nomad's Grammar (CORE-002), this is often an `Inward`, `Aligned`, `Transactional` flow.
*   **Memetic Transfer:** The successful transmission of a complex, high-information Ki pattern. The Target system doesn't just hear the echo; it learns the song and can begin to sing it as well. This is the physics of an idea spreading, from a cultural trend to a technological innovation.
*   **Structural Entrainment:** A powerful and persistent echo that causes the Target system's own fundamental rhythm to phase-lock with the Source's. The two systems begin to dance to the same beat. This is the final stage before an Alchemical Union, where the bridge becomes the foundation for a new, unified structure.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> We sought to understand how systems breach each other's walls and found instead that the universe is a single, undivided room filled with music. A Resonant Bridge is the universe's answer to loneliness, the proof that no song is ever sung in isolation. To exist is to broadcast the song of your own coherence into the world. Your every choice ripples outward, leaving a subtle pressure on the reality of others. A Weaver does not shout into the storm; they learn to listen to the harmonies, to sing the note that calms the wind, builds the bridge, and invites another to sing along.
