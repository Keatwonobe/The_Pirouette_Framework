summary: Describes the dynamics of a 'Resonance Trap,' a state of extreme systemic
  stability and hyper-inertia. This module explains how a system's perfect, self-reinforcing
  resonance carves its history into a deep 'Wound Channel,' creating a profound identity
  that also manifests as rigid resistance to change.

## §1 · Abstract: The Canyon of Being
To persist is to repeat. To repeat is to carve a path. To carve a path deeply enough is to become the path. A river may wander when the land is flat, but a river that carves a canyon is bound to its course forever. Its history becomes its destiny.

This module refactors the legacy concept of "Lock Dynamics" (TEN-LDA-1.0) into a modernized, time-first model. A Resonance Trap is not a static condition but a dynamic, self-reinforcing process. It describes a system that discovers a state of such perfect coherence that its own resonant song crystallizes the manifold around it, carving a Wound Channel so deep that deviation becomes nearly impossible. This is the fundamental mechanism behind memory, identity, and habit, but also the source of dogma, addiction, and stagnation. It is the physics of a system becoming trapped by its own perfect efficiency.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Trap: The Coherence Well
A Lock occurs when a system's echo becomes louder than any new sound. It is best understood as a deep, self-reinforcing potential well on the coherence manifold—a **Coherence Well**.

The Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006) dictates that a system will always seek states of greatest stability. A Coherence Well is a region of this landscape so deep, with such steep walls, that a system, once settled within, is trapped. The result is a state of **hyper-inertia**, where the system's interaction with its own immediate past is the dominant term in its equation of motion.

-   **Depth (Stability):** The well's depth measures the system's internal coherence. The more perfectly a system's rhythm resonates, achieving Laminar Flow (DYNA-001), the deeper it settles into its own stability.
-   **Walls (Confinement):** The steepness of the well's walls represents the system's resistance to perturbation. Any deviation from the established pattern is energetically costly, forcing the system back toward the center of the well.

This Coherence Well is not pre-existing; it is carved by the system itself through the repetition and reinforcement of its own Ki pattern, deepening its Wound Channel (CORE-011) until it becomes an inescapable feature of the landscape.

## §3 · The Three Stages of Entrapment
The formation of a Resonance Trap is a predictable, three-stage process, evolving from exploration to reinforcement to entrapment.

1.  **Harmonic Search:** The system explores its state space, seeking a path that minimizes effort and maximizes coherence. It is "tuning" itself to its environment, constantly adjusting its rhythm to find the most stable and efficient pattern.

2.  **Resonant Reinforcement:** The system discovers a highly coherent state. A positive feedback loop begins: executing the pattern is efficient, which makes it more likely to be repeated. Each repetition deepens the Wound Channel, which in turn makes the pattern even more efficient and easier to follow. This is the genesis of a habit or a memory.

3.  **Crystallization:** The Wound Channel becomes so profound that it effectively *is* the system's reality. The path of least resistance is now a chasm, a fully formed Coherence Well. To deviate would require an immense expenditure of energy to fight against the inertia of its own accumulated history. The system is no longer choosing its path; it is locked.

## §4 · The Lagrangian of Entrapment
The Resonance Trap is a direct consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

**𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)**

A system in a Resonance Trap has discovered a solution that corresponds to an exceptionally deep and sharp local minimum in its landscape of action. It is a state that maximizes the integral of 𝓛_p over time.

-   **High Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`):** The system's internal rhythm is extraordinarily pure, stable, and self-consistent.
-   **Low Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`):** The pattern is so well-adapted to its environment that it generates minimal friction or external dissonance.

The resilience of the lock—the immense energy required to climb the steep walls of the Coherence Well—is the measure of the energy differential between the system's current, hyper-coherent state and the chaotic state it would have to traverse to find a new pattern.

## §5 · A Taxonomy of Traps: The Fractal Nature of Persistence
The dynamic of the Resonance Trap is universal, manifesting across all scales as predicted by the Fractal Bridge (`CORE-014`). The principle is the same; only the medium of the Wound Channel changes.

*   **Physical Trap:** A stable particle orbit or a crystal lattice. The Wound Channel is the persistent geometry of the quantum field or the low-energy configuration of atomic bonds. Breaking the lock requires a specific quantum of energy.

*   **Biological Trap:** A stable protein fold or "muscle memory." The Wound Channel is the set of electromagnetic bonds holding a shape, or a motor skill so deeply ingrained it becomes automatic and nearly impossible to unlearn.

*   **Cognitive Trap:** A deeply held belief or a powerful addiction. The Wound Channel is a heavily myelinated neural pathway. The feedback loop is biochemical and psychological, making the familiar thought or behavior the path of least resistance.

*   **Social Trap:** A long-standing cultural tradition, a rigid bureaucracy, or a dependency on a specific technology (e.g., fossil fuels). The Wound Channel is the shared physical infrastructure, legal code, and social memory that makes change difficult and costly.

## §6 · Assemblé: The Foundation and the Cage
> The Weaver must learn the difference between a foundation and a cage. The Resonance Trap is the architecture of both. It is the mechanism of identity, the process by which a fleeting pattern earns the right to call itself a "thing." It is the anchor of memory and the foundation of all stable structures. Yet, it is also the cage of dogma, the prison of habit, and the anchor that prevents a system from adapting to a changing world.

> It teaches us that the most beautiful song, if sung without variation for too long, can become a cage built of its own perfect notes. To master our craft is to learn not only how to carve these channels of persistence, but also when, and how, to summon the flood that can reshape the stone.
