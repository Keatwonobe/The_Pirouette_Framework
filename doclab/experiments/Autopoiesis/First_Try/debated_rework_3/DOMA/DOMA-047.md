summary: Provides a unified, time-first model for systemic failure, replacing classical
  mechanics. It reframes stress, yield, and fracture as geometric consequences of
  a system's struggle to maintain coherence. Failure is defined as a phase transition
  in the Pirouette Lagrangian, where a system either scars itself by re-carving its
  Wound Channel (yielding) or decoheres catastrophically (fracture).

## §1 · Abstract: The Song Under Strain
A system does not break; it decoheres. This module refactors the entire domain of yield and fracture dynamics, replacing the classical mechanics of `PPS-027` with the time-first language of the Pirouette Framework. Stress is not an external force, but a condition of intense Temporal Pressure (Γ) that challenges a system's ability to maintain its resonant song—its Temporal Coherence ($K_\tau$). Failure is the spectrum of behaviors that emerge when that song can no longer hold its note.

We will define two critical transitions on this spectrum: **Yielding**, the point where a system is forced to survive by composing a new verse, irreversibly scarring its own memory (the Wound Channel); and **Fracture**, the point where composition fails and the system screams itself into silence. This unified geometry describes how a steel beam bends, a market crashes, and a mind breaks, all as variations of the same fundamental process.

## §2 · The Nature of Coherence Stress
The stability of any system is governed by its **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**, $\mathcal{L}_p = K_\tau - V_\Gamma$. **Coherence Stress** is the fundamental tension within this dynamic, forcing the Lagrangian towards zero or below and making coherence costly to maintain. It manifests in two ways:

1.  **Pressure Overload:** The external Temporal Pressure increases dramatically ($V_\Gamma \uparrow\uparrow$). The environment becomes too chaotic or demanding for the system's rhythm.
2.  **Rhythm Disruption:** The stress directly degrades the system's internal song, causing its Temporal Coherence to falter ($K_\tau \downarrow\downarrow$).

The *measure* of this stress is the gradient of the Lagrangian across the system's coherence manifold. A system is "stressed" when this manifold becomes steep and treacherous, forcing it to expend enormous energy to follow its path of maximal coherence.

-   **Low Stress**: A flat, wide "valley" in the manifold. The system is in a state of **Laminar Flow (DYNA-001)**.
-   **High Stress**: A warped, steep "ridge" in the manifold. The path of coherence is narrow and dangerous, and the system enters a state of **Turbulent Flow**.

## §3 · The Spectrum of Response: From Resilience to Ruin
A system's response to stress unfolds across a continuum of three distinct states, governed by the integrity of its **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**.

1.  **Elastic Deformation (Recoverable Resilience)**: Under moderate stress, the system deviates from its ideal path but remains tethered to its history. Its flow becomes briefly turbulent. Like a plucked string, it vibrates under the strain but returns to its original note once the stress is removed. The Wound Channel guides it back to its stable valley. The experience is stressful, but the system's identity is unchanged.

2.  **The Yield Transition (The Permanent Scar)**: As stress surpasses a critical threshold, the system reaches the point of no return. Its original state is no longer a viable solution to the Lagrangian. To survive, it is forced into an **alchemical union with its own damage**. This is **plastic deformation**: the system finds a new, stable Ki pattern and **permanently re-carves its own Wound Channel**. The scar from this experience becomes part of its identity. This is the mechanism of learning, adaptation, and trauma.

3.  **Fracture (Catastrophic Decoherence)**: If a system at the yield point cannot find a new stable state, it fractures. Fracture is the terminal pathology of coherence. It begins where a microscopic region loses its rhythm ($K_\tau \to 0$), creating an infinitely sharp gradient in the coherence manifold. All ambient stress flows to this point, creating a self-reinforcing cascade of decoherence. This is the ultimate state of **Coherence Fever (DYNA-003)**, a feedback loop where the system actively tears itself apart until its song is extinguished.

## §4 · The Character of Failure: Brittleness vs. Ductility
How a system fails reveals its fundamental character. This is described by a spectrum from brittle to ductile, defined by the adaptability of its internal coherence ($K_\tau$).

**Brittleness** characterizes systems with rigid, inflexible coherence. They resist stress with high fidelity up to a sharp limit, but possess little to no capacity for plastic deformation. When Coherence Stress exceeds their critical threshold, they do not bend; they shatter instantly. Their story has no middle act between perfect form and total failure.

**Ductility** characterizes systems with adaptable, flexible coherence. They can endure significant plastic deformation, absorbing immense stress by scarring their Wound Channel and reconfiguring their internal geometry. They bend, stretch, and change shape, buying survival at the cost of their original form. They fail slowly, gracefully, and with ample warning.

## §5 · Cross-Domain Failure Taxonomy
This model's power is its universality. The geometry of failure is fractal, manifesting with different variables but identical dynamics across all scales.

| Domain | Failure Mode | System Character | Lagrangian Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Material Science** | **Brittle Fracture** (Glass) | **Brittle** | Rigid $K_\tau$ cannot adapt. A sharp increase in $V_\Gamma$ (impact) causes an immediate coherence collapse ($K_\tau \to 0$). |
| | **Ductile Failure** (Steel) | **Ductile** | Flexible $K_\tau$ allows for plastic deformation. The system absorbs energy from $V_\Gamma$ by re-writing its Wound Channel (work hardening) before finally fracturing. |
| **Economics** | **Market Crash** (Panic) | **Brittle** | Coherence ($K_\tau$, trust) is rigid. A shock ($V_\Gamma$) triggers a feedback loop where $K_\tau$ evaporates instantly, leading to a system-wide fracture. |
| **Psychology** | **Mental Breakdown** | **Brittle** | An acute stressor ($V_\Gamma$) overwhelms a psyche with rigid coping mechanisms. The system fractures into a dissociative or psychotic state. |
| | **Burnout** | **Ductile** | A psyche endures chronic stress ($V_\Gamma$) through plastic deformation (forming emotional calluses, scars). It slowly yields until it reaches exhaustion and failure. |

## §6 · Assemblé
> The universe does not test a thing's strength, but the integrity of its song. Stress is the listening. It is the question the cosmos asks of every form: when the pressure comes, will you rewrite your melody, or will you fall silent?
>
> To understand the geometry of failure is to learn the art of resilience. It is to discern the difference between the groan of a structure that is bending and the shriek of one that is about to shatter. The scar is the memory of the verse that was added to survive. The shatter is the final, sudden end of a song that could not learn a new note. To a Weaver, resilience is not the art of never breaking, but the art of composing a song so beautiful it can learn to harmonize with its own pain.
