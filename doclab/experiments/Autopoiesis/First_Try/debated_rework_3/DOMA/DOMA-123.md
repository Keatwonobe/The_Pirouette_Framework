## §1 · Abstract: The Universe That Remembers
This module provides the primary Pirouette instrument for fundamental cosmology, refactoring the search for anomalies from a hunt for errors into an act of cosmic archaeology. The universe is not a static object but a living document, its violent history written into the very geometry of its being. The great anomalies we observe are not flaws in the present; they are the scars of the past.

This instrument operates by first generating a **Null Canvas**—a theoretical map of an idealized, unscarred universe as predicted by the Pirouette Lagrangian. It then compares this baseline to the **Cosmic Palimpsest** of observational data (from the CMB, galaxy surveys, etc.) to calculate a **Coherence Residual Map**. The features on this map are the anomalies: the **Cosmic Wound Channels** that reveal the universe's memory, charting the echoes of ancient turbulence and the sutures from its very creation.

## §2 · From Static Lattice to Dynamic Palimpsest
The prior framework's concept of a "spacetime meta-lattice" was a useful but limited metaphor. The modern framework is founded on a more powerful, dynamic concept.

*   **The Cosmic Coherence Manifold**: This is the large-scale expression of the coherence manifold introduced in the CORE series. It is the vast, evolving landscape whose geometry is governed by the ceaseless drive to maximize coherence. The great filaments and voids of the cosmic web are the topographical features of this manifold.

*   **The Null Canvas**: Our theoretical reference is no longer a rigid grid but the simplest solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian for an expanding universe: a state of perfect, uniform coherence. This is a universe without history, a smooth, unwritten canvas representing the state of maximal, simple coherence.

*   **The Cosmic Palimpsest**: This is the universe as we observe it, a complex story written over the Null Canvas. The anisotropies in the CMB and the clustering of galaxies are the ink of this story. Anomalies are not "faults" but the narrative features that reveal the history of the universe's interaction with itself.

## §3 · The Anomaly Detection Protocol
The protocol is a three-step process for moving from raw observational data to a high-fidelity map of the universe's memory.

**I. Translate the Cosmic Palimpsest:**
Using the principles of the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014), raw observational data is translated into the language of the coherence manifold.
*   **Input**: Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps, galaxy distribution surveys, gravitational lensing data.
*   **Process**: This data is used to infer the *observed* properties of the Cosmic Coherence Manifold. CMB temperature fluctuations map to variations in primordial Temporal Pressure, while galaxy clustering reveals the observed resonant patterns.
*   **Output**: Maps of the observed field, `𝓛_p(observed)`.

**II. Generate the Null Canvas:**
The theoretical baseline is computed based on a smooth, homogenous, and isotropic cosmology.
*   **Input**: Standard cosmological parameters (e.g., Ω_m, Ω_Λ).
*   **Process**: The Pirouette Lagrangian is solved for these parameters to generate a map of the predicted, maximally coherent field. This is the universe with no history.
*   **Output**: Maps of the baseline model, `𝓛_p(model)`.

**III. Calculate the Residuals & Map the Scars:**
The observed map is subtracted from the theoretical map to reveal where reality deviates from the idealized state.
*   **Process**: The Coherence Residual is calculated: `Δ𝓛_p = 𝓛_p(observed) - 𝓛_p(model)`.
*   **Output**: A **Coherence Residual Map**. This is not a map of errors, but a map of history. Regions where this value exceeds a statistical threshold are flagged and classified as cosmic scars.

## §4 · The Anatomy of a Cosmic Scar: Classifying the Residuals
The features on the Coherence Residual Map are classified by their nature as geometric memories within the dynamic manifold.

*   **Temporal Pressure Eddies**: Broad regions where the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) deviates significantly from the smooth expansion of the Null Canvas. These are the cosmic equivalent of deep, slow eddies in the river of time, ancient disturbances still shaping the cosmic flow.

*   **Structural Filaments (Cosmic Wound Channels)**: The primary scars, corresponding to the vast walls and filaments of the cosmic web. As established in CORE-011, these are reinforced channels where the path of maximal coherence has been deepened over eons, guiding the flow of matter and light like riverbeds carved into the fabric of spacetime.

*   **Phase Fractures (Topological Seams)**: The most profound scars, theorized to be the boundaries where different primordial regions underwent an imperfect **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) during a phase transition. Detecting a Phase Fracture would be like finding a suture from the universe's birth—direct evidence of its initial synthesis.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This instrument transforms the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) from an equation of motion into a tool for cosmic excavation.

The **Null Canvas** represents the universe following the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**—the solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations for a perfectly homogenous system.
`𝓛_model = K_τ - V_Γ`

However, the universe remembers its own creation. The *Scars of Creation* are persistent, non-uniform terms in the Lagrangian itself—`V_scar(x)`—that represent the stored "potential energy" of a historical trauma. The true Lagrangian of our universe is:
`𝓛_observed = K_τ - (V_Γ + V_scar(x))`

The **Coherence Residual Map** (`Δ𝓛_p`) is therefore our direct measurement of this historical term: `Δ𝓛_p ≈ -V_scar(x)`. By mapping the residuals, we are mapping the geometry and intensity of the universe's memory, reconstructing the shape of the primordial events that created the landscape we inhabit.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We look to the heavens not for perfection, but for character. A flawless crystal tells no story. A scarred old stone tells the story of the mountain it came from. The universe is not a perfect crystal; it is a magnificent, character-rich stone. To be a Weaver is to read its history in its flaws, to understand that the deepest truths are not written in the smooth places, but in the magnificent, beautiful scars that prove the past is never lost, merely embedded in the geometry of the present. History is the landscape we call home.
