summary: Replaces the analogical Semantic Gravity Model with a first-principles derivation
  from the Pirouette Lagrangian. It models the 'gravity' of a concept not as a force,
  but as the curvature it induces in the coherence manifold. A concept's 'mass' is
  a direct measure of its temporal coherence and historical depth, and its influence
  is the tendency of other ideas to follow the geodesic on this curved landscape of
  meaning.

## §1 · Abstract: The Curvature of Thought

This module presents a fundamental refactoring of our understanding of narrative dynamics, superseding the analogical framework of PPS-016. The previous model posited that ideas behave *like* massive objects. This new model, grounded in the core principles of the Pirouette Framework, makes a more profound claim: the influence of a concept and the gravity of a star are not alike; they are expressions of the same universal law.

This is not a metaphor. A concept does not *have* mass; a sufficiently coherent concept *is* a massive object in the Pirouette sense. Its "force" is the distortion it creates in the local coherence manifold—the landscape of meaning itself. Other, less coherent ideas do not feel a "pull"; they simply follow the path of least resistance—the geodesic—along the curves established by the most stable and resonant concepts in their environment.

## §2 · From Semantic Mass to Temporal Coherence

The old model's arbitrary `m_S` mass function is retired. A concept's "mass"—its capacity to influence and resist change—is a direct, non-arbitrary measure of its **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)**, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

A concept with high coherence, and therefore high "mass," possesses two key properties:

1.  **A Pure Ki Resonance:** The concept is internally consistent, clear, and unambiguous. It is a "pure note" with low internal dissonance. A concept like "justice" may be complex, but a specific, coherent *conception* of justice has this purity, allowing it to resonate powerfully.
2.  **A Deep Wound Channel (CORE-011):** The concept has history, inertia, and memory. It has been repeated, reinforced, and woven into the fabric of a mind or a culture. Its pattern is deeply carved into the manifold, giving it immense inertia and making it difficult to alter or erase.

A "heavy" idea, therefore, is one that is both deeply ingrained and logically sound. It is a stable, persistent, and powerful resonance in the symphony of thought.

## §3 · The Coherence Manifold of Narrative

Every narrative, from a single thought to a global ideology, exists upon a coherence manifold. This is the landscape where the potential for meaning resides. A powerful, coherent concept acts precisely like a massive object in spacetime, as described in The Gladiator Force (CORE-008). It locally increases Temporal Pressure (Γ), wrapping itself in a deep "coherence well."

The act of thinking or communicating is the act of tracing a path across this manifold. The "gravity of meaning" is the observable tendency for our thoughts and words to fall into the deepest, most stable coherence wells available. We do not choose our core beliefs so much as we find our thoughts naturally orbiting them.

## §4 · The Lagrangian of Discourse

The interaction between ideas is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): **𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**. The "force" between two concepts is the gradient in the coherence manifold they collectively create. We can express the interaction potential `V(A, B)` between two concepts, A and B, as a function of their phase relationship `Δφ`:

`V(A, B) ∝ - (Kτ_A * Kτ_B / r) * cos(Δφ)`

Where `Kτ` is the temporal coherence ("mass") of each concept and `r` is their distance in an abstract "meaning space." The nature of this interaction—attraction or repulsion—emerges from this potential.

-   **Attraction (Constructive Interference):** When two concepts are in-phase (`Δφ ≈ 0`, `cos(Δφ) ≈ 1`), such as "courage" and "bravery," their resonances constructively interfere. The interaction potential becomes strongly negative, creating a deeper, more stable shared basin of meaning. This is the geometry of synergy and the drive toward an Alchemical Union.

-   **Repulsion (Destructive Interference):** When two concepts are out-of-phase (`Δφ ≈ π`, `cos(Δφ) ≈ -1`), such as "courage" and "cowardice," their resonances destructively interfere. The interaction potential becomes positive, creating a region of intense temporal turbulence and dissonance (a spike in V_Γ). The path of maximal coherence is for them to move apart, seeking states of greater stability.

## §5 · Force as a Geodesic of Meaning

The framework no longer requires a separate calculation for "force." What we perceive as the force of an argument or the attraction between ideas is the emergent effect of a concept tracing its geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—across the landscape defined by the Lagrangian potential.

An idea is not "pulled" by another. It is navigating a curved landscape. When a new idea is introduced, it will naturally evolve along the path of least resistance, which inevitably leads it toward the basin of an established, "massive" attractor. This explains why it is easier to think thoughts that align with powerful cultural ideas; the path is already carved.

## §6 · Validation & Application

This model reframes the goal of analysis. An "Attractor Map" is no longer an analogy; it is a literal mapping of the coherence manifold of a given discourse. By mapping the "mass" (Kτ) of core concepts and their phase relationships, we can predict the likely trajectory of new information introduced into the system.

This allows a Weaver to move from mere debate to informational engineering: identifying the precise points of leverage where a small, coherent idea can reshape the entire landscape of a conversation. The primary challenge remains the accurate mapping of the domain-specific features of the coherence manifold and its ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).

> We sought to model the gravity of ideas and found that we were simply modeling gravity. The universe does not distinguish between the law that bends starlight around a sun and the law that bends a conversation toward a foundational truth. Both are acts of coherence shaping the fabric of reality. A Weaver understands this: to introduce a new, powerful idea is not to shout into the wind. It is to place a new star in the sky of the mind, and to trust that the worlds of thought will, in their own time, find their new and perfect orbits around it.
