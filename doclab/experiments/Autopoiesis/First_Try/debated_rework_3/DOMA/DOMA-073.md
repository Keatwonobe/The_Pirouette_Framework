### §1 · The Second Heart

A theory proven only in the laboratory is a song sung in a quiet room. To be universal, its echo must be heard across the cathedral of the cosmos. The Pirouette Framework, with its core engine, the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), has been built from the ground up, validated by the precise echo of a single electron—its first heart. This module proposes to find its second.

It outlines a protocol to listen for the universe's own resonant signature, a faint but persistent "heartbeat" left over from the dawn of time. We will use the most precise clocks in the cosmos—an array of millisecond pulsars—as a vast, galactic stethoscope. Success would provide an independent, cosmological derivation of the framework's constants, proving its principles are not just a clever model, but a scale-invariant truth.

### §2 · The Primordial Resonance Hypothesis

The universe remembers its birth. The framework posits that the initial, violent unfolding from the Whispering Void (CORE-000) was not perfectly smooth. It left behind a vast, helical **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) in the fabric of spacetime—a geometric scar, a memory of the cosmos's first pirouette.

This persistent, large-scale structure is not inert. It acts as a standing wave of coherence, a permanent stressor on the manifold that causes a slight, periodic oscillation in the background **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**. This is the "breathing" of the **Gladiator Force** (CORE-008) on a cosmic scale—the deep rhythm of the feedback loop governing existence. This cosmic heartbeat can be modeled as:

`Γ(x, t) = Γ₀ + δΓ cos(ω_c t + k_c ⋅ x)`

where `Γ₀` is the background pressure, `δΓ` is the small amplitude of the cosmic heartbeat, and `ω_c` is its fundamental frequency.

### §3 · Pulsars as Coherence Probes

A pulsar's signal is more than a beacon; it is a measuring line laid across the cosmos. The light from these celestial clocks is a coherent pattern propagating through the dynamic medium of the coherence manifold. Its path and, crucially, its arrival time are directly modulated by any variations in the intervening Temporal Pressure (Γ).

As the pulsar's signal traverses the oscillating `Γ(t)` of the cosmic heartbeat, its travel time will be periodically stretched and compressed to maintain maximal coherence along its geodesic path. This will imprint a predictable, periodic "wobble" onto the time-of-arrival data recorded by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). The timing residuals are a direct measurement of the universe's own pulse.

### §4 · The Lagrangian Connection

This experiment is a direct and profound test of the framework's central equation. The path of a pulsar's signal through spacetime is the one that maximizes the action, `S_p`, which is the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006):

`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, where `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Here, `K_τ` represents the internal coherence of the signal, and `V_Γ` represents the "cost" imposed by the ambient Temporal Pressure. Our hypothesis is a modification to this potential term, making it explicitly time-dependent:

`V_Γ(t) = V_Γ₀ + f(δΓ cos(ω_c t))`

By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to this time-dependent Lagrangian, the resulting equation of motion for the signal explicitly predicts a periodic deviation in its trajectory. This deviation, when integrated over cosmological distances, produces precisely the timing residual sideband we seek to measure. A positive detection would be a direct measurement of the dynamic nature of the coherence manifold, confirming the core mechanics of the Lagrangian on a galactic scale.

### §5 · Protocol: Listening for the Heartbeat

The search requires a meticulous process of signal extraction, turning the noise of the cosmos into a clear note.

1.  **The Instrument**: Combine the long-term timing data from the world's leading Pulsar Timing Arrays (NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA) into a single dataset of the highest possible sensitivity and sky coverage.
2.  **Signal Isolation**: Apply advanced pre-whitening algorithms to the timing residuals of each pulsar. This process filters out known noise sources, including interstellar dispersion, solar wind, clock errors, and the stochastic gravitational-wave background.
3.  **The Coherent Search**: Employ a matched-filter search across the cleaned residual data, specifically looking for a faint, narrow-band, periodic signal that is **common across a significant number of pulsars**. This shared nature is the key indicator of a global, cosmological effect.
4.  **The Fingerprint: The Ki-Lock Test**: The definitive confirmation is not just finding a signal, but verifying its identity. A true detection of the cosmic heartbeat must exhibit amplitude ratios and harmonic content that are geometrically locked to the framework's fundamental Ki constants. This unique signature—the framework's mathematical fingerprint—would distinguish it from any other known astrophysical phenomenon.

### §6 · Assemblé

> We sought to test our laws against the heavens and found ourselves taking the pulse of the universe. The quantum and the cosmic are not two different realms; they are two verses of the same song, written with the same notes. To hear this cosmic heartbeat in the steady ticking of the pulsars is to receive the ultimate confirmation: the framework is not a map we have drawn, but a song the universe has been singing all along. We are finally learning to hear the tune.
