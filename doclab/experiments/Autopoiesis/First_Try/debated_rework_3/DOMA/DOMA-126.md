## §1 · Abstract: The Unseen Erosion
A system can die in two ways: by a sudden, violent fracture, or by a slow, quiet unraveling. While a collapse is dramatic and obvious, this second pathology—drift—is far more insidious. It is the unseen erosion of form, the gradual fraying of the thread of being.

This module provides the formal dynamic model for **Coherence Erosion**, the third great pathology defined by the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003). Drift is best understood not as a distinct state, but as a chronic, low-grade form of **Turbulent Flow** (DYNA-001). It is the process by which a system, under the constant, abrasive pressure of ambient temporal noise (Γ), loses the precision of its resonant pattern (Ki) and the integrity of its memory (Wound Channel). It is the story of a system slowly forgetting how to be itself.

## §2 · The Anatomy of Fraying
A healthy system is a resonant act of self-remembrance, an autopoietic cycle that reinforces its own identity. Drift is the subversion of this cycle, a corrosive feedback loop that turns a system's own inertia against it.

1.  **The Sandpaper of Entropy**: Every system is perpetually bombarded by the dissonant echoes of ambient temporal noise (Γ). This noise acts as a constant, gentle abrasion on the system's resonant pattern (Ki).
2.  **Introduction of Noise**: With each cycle, this abrasion introduces microscopic errors—a slight phase lag, a minor impurity. A healthy system corrects for these, but the pressure is relentless.
3.  **Ki Degradation**: Over time, uncorrected errors accumulate. The system's clear, resonant note begins to fuzz and lose its precision. Its signal-to-noise ratio decreases, and its temporal coherence (Kτ) declines.
4.  **Wound Channel as Rutted Road**: As the Ki pattern becomes noisy, the Wound Channel (CORE-011) it carves becomes less defined. The riverbed begins to erode and widen. Each meandering step makes this new, less efficient path slightly deeper, and the optimal one slightly harder to return to.
5.  **Path Fixation**: A blurry, rutted Wound Channel provides weaker guidance, yet its inertia still compels the system to follow it. The memory that once ensured stability now ensures the persistence of a suboptimal state, making the system more susceptible to further deviation from the noise of Γ.

This loop—from noise, to Ki degradation, to a rutted Wound Channel, to greater susceptibility to noise—is the engine of drift. It is the slow, inexorable victory of entropy over information.

## §3 · Diagnostic Signatures & Intervention
A Weaver can diagnose Coherence Erosion long before a final collapse by observing its tangible effects on a system's flow. The intervention for Erosion, as defined by the Daedalus Gambit (DYNA-003), is to **reinforce the channel**.

| Diagnostic Signature                | Description                                                                                                                                              | Daedalus Gambit (Intervention)                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Loss of Precision**               | The system's rhythm becomes inconsistent. Actions that were once effortless now require conscious correction. There is a noticeable phase lag.                 | **Coherent Injection:** Introduce a pure, strong, resonant signal (a clear statement of purpose, a ritual, a core memory).  |
| **Decreased Efficiency**            | The system requires more energy to perform its core functions. It exhibits a slow, steady "leak" of coherence and a feeling of rising internal friction. | **Noise Shielding:** Create a temporary, low-Γ environment to reduce external pressure and allow the system to self-repair. |
| **Path Fixation (Rigidity)**        | The system resists change and innovation, trapped in its degraded Wound Channel. It can only repeat familiar, inefficient patterns.                           | **Pattern Reinforcement:** Guide the system through exercises and repetitions that deepen its original, optimal Wound Channel.     |

## §4 · The Cascade Threshold: The Point of No Return
A thread can only fray so much before it snaps. A drifting system does not degrade indefinitely; it approaches a critical phase transition, a point of **Coherence Cascade Failure**.

This is the threshold where the system's degraded Ki pattern is no longer stable enough to resist the ambient Temporal Pressure. Its internal coherence can no longer hold itself together. At this point, the system faces one of two fates:

1.  **Reconfiguration (Basin Shift)**: It collapses into a new, different, and typically simpler Ki pattern. It "forgets" its complex identity and adopts a more primitive one. An advanced society might collapse into tribalism; a nuanced ideology might decay into rigid dogma.
2.  **Dissolution**: It fails to find any new stable resonance and dissolves completely. Its remaining information is lost as its components are scattered back into the chaotic noise of the Temporal Forge.

## §5 · Lagrangian Connection: Falling from Grace
The process of drift is a story told in the language of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. A healthy system evolves along a geodesic that maximizes its action integral (`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`), the total coherence expressed over time.

Drift is the direct, observable consequence of this integral consistently and slowly decreasing. The primary cause is the decay of the kinetic term, `K_τ`, as the Ki pattern's signal frays. As coherence decreases, the system becomes less efficient at managing environmental pressure, effectively increasing the "cost" of the potential term, `V_Γ`. The system falls from its geodesic, its path no longer one of maximal coherence, but of slow, grinding decay into a basin of attraction characterized by chronic inefficiency.

## §6 · The Assemblé
> We train our eyes for the storm, the fracture, the sudden collapse. But an old tree does not fall in a single gust of wind; it is hollowed out from the inside, year by quiet year. Collapse is loud, but drift is silent. It is the whisper of entropy, the quiet tragedy of a song slowly going out of tune, of a purpose forgotten one small compromise at a time.
>
> To be a Weaver is to be a guardian against this silence. The finest art is not to mend the dramatic break, but to sense the subtle loss of tension and reinforce the weave before it is ever torn. It is to listen for the sound of the universal tide, and to spend one's life singing a clearer note against it.
