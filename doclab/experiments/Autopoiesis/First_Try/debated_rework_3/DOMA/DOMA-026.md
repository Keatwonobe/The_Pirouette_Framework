summary: Provides the definitive, time-first grammar for the Pirouette Framework.
  This module is the single source of truth for the symbols, parameters, and concepts
  born from the collapse of the old triaxial model. It is a living, autopoietic grammar,
  grounded in the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §1 · Abstract: The Grammar of Creation
Before a song can be written, its notes must be named. This module is the definitive lexicon for the modernized Pirouette Framework, but it is not a static dictionary. It is a living grammar—the set of rules by which the language of resonance is spoken, written, and evolved.

The Great Refactoring collapsed the cumbersome triaxial model into a simpler, more powerful engine grounded in a single substance: Time. This act created a new vocabulary. This document is the formal registry of that vocabulary, ensuring every symbol and term is used with clarity and consistency. It reveals the deep, causal interconnections between concepts, grounding them all in the central sentence of the framework: the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §2 · The Fractal Lexicon
The language of the framework is fractal, mirroring the structure of reality it describes. The lexicon is therefore organized in tiers, flowing from the universal, autopoietic principles to their mathematical expression and emergent applications.

### Tier 1: The Autopoietic Core
These are the fundamental, scale-invariant constituents of the Pirouette cycle. All other concepts are derived from their interplay.

| Symbol | Name | Definition & Grounding | Origin |
|:-------|:-----|:-----------------------|:-------|
| **τ_p** | The Pirouette Cycle | The fundamental quantum of time for a system; the duration of one complete cycle of its stable resonant pattern (Ki). It is the universe's primary verb: "to be." | CORE-005 |
| **Γ** | Temporal Pressure | A scalar field representing the density and complexity of interfering temporal rhythms. It is the ambient, chaotic "noise" against which a system must maintain its form. | CORE-003 |
| **Ki** | Temporal Resonance | The specific, stable, geometric pattern a system manifests to exist within a given Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the system's unique "note" in the cosmic song. | CORE-004 |
| **T_a** | Time Adherence | A scalar quality (0 → 1) representing the purity and stability of a system's Ki resonance. It is the "signal-to-noise" ratio; the clarity of the system's note. | CORE-005 |
| **ω_k** | Resonant Frequency | The angular frequency of a system's Ki pattern (ω_k = 2π/τ_p). It is a direct measure of its internal clock-speed or "tempo." | CORE-006 |

### Tier 2: The Lagrangian Formalism
This is the mathematical grammar used to describe the dynamics of the Core Principles.

| Symbol | Name | Definition & Grounding | Origin |
|:-------|:-----|:-----------------------|:-------|
| **𝓛_p** | Pirouette Lagrangian | The master function (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ) that summarizes the dynamics of any system, expressing the trade-off between internal stability and external pressure. | CORE-006 |
| **S_p** | Coherence Action | The integral of the Lagrangian over a system's Pirouette Cycle (τ_p). The Principle of Maximal Coherence states that systems evolve along paths that maximize this value. | CORE-006 |
| **K_τ** | Temporal Coherence | The "kinetic" term (K_τ = T_a ⋅ ω_k). It represents the quality and intensity of a system's internal rhythm. | CORE-006 |
| **V_Γ** | Pressure Potential | The "potential" term (V_Γ = f(Γ)). It represents the energetic "cost" for a system to maintain its coherence against the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). | CORE-006 |
| **μ, ν, ρ** | Spacetime Indices | Lowercase Greek letters denote components of 4-vectors and tensors (range 0-3). Einstein summation is assumed. Used to describe the geometry of the coherence manifold. | N/A |
| **∇** | Covariant Derivative | The operator for differentiation on the curved coherence manifold. A system's acceleration is proportional to the gradient of the Lagrangian (`∇𝓛_p`), as it "surfs" the geometry of coherence. | N/A |

### Tier 3: Emergent & Derived Concepts
These are higher-order phenomena and analytical tools that emerge from the application of the core principles. This list is a living catalog.

| Name | Module | Definition & Grounding |
|:-----|:-------|:-----------------------|
| **Wound Channel** | CORE-011 | A persistent geometric scar an entity's resonance leaves in the local coherence manifold; the physical basis for memory and inertia. |
| **Gladiator Force**| CORE-008 | The principle of confinement (strong force, gravity), understood not as a fundamental force but as a non-linear behavior of the V_Γ term at extreme scales. |
| **Observer's Shadow**| CORE-010 | The geometric imprint an observer's own coherence pattern unavoidably imposes upon the system being observed. |
| **Flow Dynamics** | DYNA-001 | The study of coherence in motion, diagnosing system health through states of Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant flow. |

## §3 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This Lexicon is the essential prerequisite for understanding the framework's central engine, the Pirouette Lagrangian:

**𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ = (T_a ⋅ ω_k) - f(Γ)**

Without the precise definitions provided above, this equation is merely symbols. This Lexicon gives them meaning. It clarifies that **K_τ** is not abstract energy, but the quantifiable quality of a system's unique song, while **V_Γ** is the measurable pressure of the cosmic choir it must sing within. This module is the key that turns the equation into a predictive engine.

## §4 · The Deprecation Protocol
The Great Refactoring requires not only new terms but the formal retirement of old ones to prevent conceptual drift.

| Old Symbol (PPS-007) | Status | Modern Equivalent & Rationale |
|:---------------------|:-------|:--------------------------------|
| **Vector T_a (T_Q, T_I, T_C)** | **Deprecated** | Subsumed by the scalar `T_a` (quality) and the rich geometry of the `Ki` pattern. The old vector was a clumsy attempt to encode a system's form into the adherence field itself. |
| **K_i (Ki Constant)** | **Deprecated** | The concept of `Ki` has been elevated from a simple constant to represent the entirety of a system's resonant pattern. The old constant was an artifact of an oversimplified model. |
| **χ (Clock Field)** | **Subsumed** | The need for a universal, absolute time reference (`χ`) is eliminated. The universe is woven from the countless individual heartbeats (`τ_p`) of its constituent systems. |
| **G (Gravitational Constant)** | **Recontextualized** | An effective, scale-dependent macroscopic average of the fundamental `Γ` field. `G` is not a universal constant but an emergent property of how `Γ` manifests as confinement. |

## §5 · The Principle of Autopoiesis
This lexicon is not a stone tablet; it is a living document, subject to the same laws of coherence it describes. A new term cannot be added by decree; it must be *born*. A concept is proposed only after emerging as a necessary tool. It must then prove its right to exist by demonstrating that it connects harmonically to the Core Principles and increases, rather than disrupts, the coherence of the entire lexicon. This ensures the language of the framework remains a sharp, potent, and elegant instrument.

## §6 · Assemblé
> A Weaver's tools are not of wood or steel, but of language. Every name is a lens, every symbol a scalpel, every definition a map. This Lexicon is the forge where those tools are made, the sheet music for reality. To master this grammar is not merely to describe the tapestry, but to learn to hold its threads and participate in the act of creation. A precise language is the forge in which a coherent thought is made.
