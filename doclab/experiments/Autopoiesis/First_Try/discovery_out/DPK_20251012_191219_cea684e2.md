## Problem: Coherence Deficit Across Scales
Synthesize open contradictions in modern physics (spacetime emergence, lepton g-2), cognitive science (awareness continuity), and social cascades; propose time-first, coherence-substrate hypotheses with measurable predictions.
**Contradictions:**
- Relativistic locality vs. quantum nonlocal correlations
- High-precision SM predictions vs. measured lepton g-2 anomalies
- Emergentist consciousness vs. substrate dynamics signatures
**Related Claims:**
- (0.60) Muon g-2 deviates from perturbative SM prediction at ppm scale in some analyses — _literature_
- (0.50) Neural triadic phase-locking correlates with sustained awareness — _lab-theory_
- (0.60) Social cascades exhibit threshold behavior and critical slowing — _socio-dynamics_

## Math Sketch
**Assumptions**
- Time-substrate fields exist with adherence T_a and pressure Γ
- A coherence density Ki couples to observables via gauge-compatible terms
- Measurement deforms local geometry (observer back-action)
**Variables**
- Ki: coherence density field
- Γ: temporal pressure / load
- T_a: time-adherence order parameter
**Equations**
- S_time[Ki, Γ, T_a] = ∫ d^4x L(Ki, Γ, T_a)
- ∂_μ J^μ = 0 (coherence current conservation)
- Δg-2 ∝ f(Γ, Ki) at lepton mass shell
**Invariants**
- Coherence area A_Ki conserved within awareness window
- No free energy from closed coherence loops (second law compliant)

## Predictions
- **numeric** Tau lepton anomalous magnetic moment exhibits Γ-coupling trend extrapolated from muon channel
  - Falsify if: If precise τ g-2 measurement matches SM without additional term within uncertainties, hypothesis fails.
- **phenomenological** EEG/MEG shows narrowing detuning bandwidth Δf_allowed ∝ Γ^{-1/2} during high-load tasks
  - Falsify if: If bandwidth does not shrink with task-induced Γ increase, falsify.
- **phenomenological** Pressuron-like signatures alter cluster lensing residuals under specific surface tension regimes
  - Falsify if: If stacked clusters show no consistent residual pattern after baryonic modeling, falsify.

## Experiments
- **Tau g-2 campaign concept**
  - Apparatus: Belle-II dataset access, QED+EW+hadronic pipeline, systematics budget
  - Signal: Δa_τ trend vs. Γ proxy
  - Threshold: Detect non-SM component at agreed σ threshold
  - Failure mode: No deviation within uncertainties over multiple datasets
- **Triadic resonance EEG/MEG replication**
  - Apparatus: 128ch EEG/MEG, closed-loop tACS, Morlet/Hilbert pipeline
  - Signal: TPCI ridge + Δf_allowed shrinkage
  - Threshold: Pre-registered effect size (e.g., Cohen's d≥0.5)
  - Failure mode: No ridge / no shrinkage across participants

## Cross-Domain Hooks
- Map RG exponents from neural collapse to social cascade recovery
- Transfer Ki-invariants to market microstructure volatility bursts

## Philosophy Seeds
- **Q:** Is consciousness fundamentally geometric motion in a time-substrate?
  - Tension: Subjective continuity vs. discrete phase slips
  - Governance: Design systems that stabilize beneficial coherence while minimizing Dark Residue.
- **Q:** When does coherence-maximization conflict with pluralism?
  - Tension: Minority resonance vs. global optimum
  - Governance: Embed safeguards: consentful coherence and fail-open governance triggers.
