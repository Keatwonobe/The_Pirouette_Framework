## Law
The Principle of Correspondence posits that a fractal structure is the geometric trace of a scale-invariant geodesic, which is the path of least action (`δS = 0`) that extremizes the Pirouette Lagrangian `L = Kτ - V_Γ` across multiple scales. `Kτ` represents system coherence and `V_Γ` represents environmental pressure.

The generative process is defined by three measurable signatures:
1.  **Coherence Complexity (`D_f`)**: The fractal dimension, quantifying how effectively a generative pattern fills its embedding space.
2.  **Inter-Scale Coherence (`T_a_scale`)**: The fidelity (signal-to-noise ratio) of the generative rule's self-similarity across scales, where `T_a_scale` → 1 indicates perfect, noiseless recursion.
3.  **Generative Rhythm (`ω_g`)**: The fundamental temporal frequency of the recursive, pattern-forming process.

The relationship between these signatures is formalized by the Generative Equation:
`D_f ≈ 1 + C * (ω_g) * ( T_a_scale / (1 - T_a_scale) ) * f(Γ)`

Where `C` is a system-dependent constant and `f(Γ)` is a function describing the constraining influence of ambient Temporal Pressure `Γ`. This equation models the emergence of complexity (`D_f`) from the interplay of an intrinsic generative rhythm (`ω_g`), the rule's fidelity (`T_a_scale`), and external environmental constraints (`Γ`).

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The principle is falsified if, for a given system, the empirically measured `D_f` consistently and significantly deviates from the value predicted by its measured `ω_g`, `T_a_scale`, and a well-defined `f(Γ)`. It is also falsified if a more energetically efficient, non-self-similar solution to the Lagrangian is demonstrated under conditions where the principle predicts a fractal geodesic.

## Philosophy
The universe’s apparent complexity is not evidence of a multitude of disparate natural laws. It is the signature of a single, astonishingly parsimonious generative principle iterating upon itself at every possible scale. Ontological diversity is an illusion; there is only one rule, whose expression is modulated by the infinite variety of local conditions.

The universe is a grammar, not a dictionary. Learn one rule of conjugation, and you can speak in galaxies.
