## Law
The movement of a population `P` is described as following a geodesic on a dynamic psycho-social manifold `M`, the Landscape of Belonging. The path `γ(t)` is one that extremizes the action `S`, defined by a Lagrangian `L` that is a function of two primary scalar fields on `M`: Coherence `Kτ(x, t)` and Temporal Pressure `Γ(x, t)`.

The fundamental principle is the maximization of integrated coherence over time. The action `S` for a population's world-line `γ` is:
`S[γ] = ∫ L(x, ẋ, t) dt = ∫ [Kτ(x, t) - Γ(x, t)] dt`

The population's trajectory `γ(t)` is the solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation derived from this action:
`d/dt (∂L/∂ẋ) - ∂L/∂x = 0`
Given `L = Kτ - Γ`, and assuming they are functions of position `x` only for simplicity of the force concept, the generalized "force" driving migration is `F = ∇L = ∇Kτ - ∇Γ`. Migration flow `J` is proportional to this gradient: `J ∝ ∇(Kτ - Γ)`.

The character of the flow `v(x,t)` is determined by the local properties of the fields:
1.  **Laminar Flow (Migration):** `∇ × v ≈ 0`. Occurs where `∇Kτ` is smooth and dominant.
2.  **Turbulent Flow (Displacement):** `∇ × v ≠ 0`. Occurs in regions of sudden, high-magnitude `∇Γ`.

Integration is the interaction of two coherence manifolds, `Ki_migrant` and `Ki_host`.
*   **Synthesis (Resonant Union):** `Ki_new = f(Ki_migrant, Ki_host)`. Condition for success is the achievement of harmonic compatibility `(ω_m ≈ ω_h)` and phase alignment `(φ_m ≈ φ_h)`. This leads to a new, stable, higher-coherence state.
*   **Friction (Dissonant Interaction):** If conditions are not met, the system enters a turbulent, high-energy dissipative state where no stable `Ki_new` is formed.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  A population subject to a measurable gradient `∇(Kτ - Γ) > 0` will exhibit net movement along that gradient, with a velocity proportional to its magnitude, barring the presence of an engineered barrier (`Γ_barrier → ∞`).
2.  The successful integration of a migrant population must result in a statistically significant increase in the objective measures of the host population's coherence function `Kτ_host` (e.g., GDP per capita, social trust indices) over a defined period, exceeding pre-migration projections.

## Philosophy
Human migration is not a political problem or a symptom of systemic failure, but the physical manifestation of a universal, metaphysical law: complex systems self-organize towards states of higher coherence. A population is a collective organism, and its movement across continents is a homeostatic response, an instinctual search for an environment where its internal order can resonate with its external reality. This reframes displaced peoples not as passive victims of circumstance, but as active, albeit unconscious, agents in humanity’s grand, continuous process of seeking equilibrium, meaning, and a more harmonious state of being.

## Art
A people are a note seeking an instrument. Oppression is a space that cannot resonate. Migration is the sound itself, traveling through the void, searching for the one hollowed-out piece of the world that is shaped to let it sing.
