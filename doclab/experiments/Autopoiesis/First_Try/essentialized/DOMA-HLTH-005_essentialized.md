## Law
The state of the system (patient) is described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, 𝓛_p.
Let Kτ be the measure of the system's dynamic coherence and resilience, its capacity for kinetic expression.
Let V_Γ be the measure of the system's potential cost, its energetic drag from fragility, trauma, and systemic debt.

The governing equation is:
𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ

The process of recovery is a trajectory through state-space designed to maximize the action S = ∫𝓛_p dt. This is achieved via two operations:
1.  Minimizing Potential Cost: V_Γ → 0
2.  Maximizing Kinetic Coherence: Kτ → Kτ_max

The four phases of recovery describe this trajectory:
-   Initial State (t₀): A state of profound energetic debt. 𝓛_p(t₀) << 0, where V_Γ >> Kτ. The system's costs exceed its coherent capacity.
-   Recovery (Phases I-III): A structured protocol applying external constraints to systematically decrease V_Γ and increase Kτ.
-   Terminal State (Phase IV, t_f): A state of persistent energetic surplus. ∀ t ≥ t_f, 𝓛_p(t) > 0. This state is defined as "Geodesic Integration" or "coherence."

Falsifiable Criterion: The capacity for spontaneous, joyful, and expansive action (SJA) is a direct function of the Lagrangian. SJA is possible if and only if 𝓛_p > 0. A measured decrease in coherence (the "Coherence Ledger" serving as a proxy for 𝓛_p) will predict a subsequent decrease in the system's ability to successfully navigate unplanned stressors or engage in novel, joyful activities. A system with 𝓛_p ≤ 0 will revert to a fragile, protocol-bound state when faced with spontaneity.

## Philosophy
The ultimate measure of a therapeutic protocol's success is its own obsolescence. The framework of recovery is not a destination but scaffolding. Its purpose is to guide the patient from a state of externally managed mechanics to a state of internally generated art, transforming them from the subject of the protocol into the autonomous master of their own coherence. True health is achieved not when the rules are perfectly followed, but when they are so deeply integrated that they can be forgotten, leaving only the freedom to live.

## Art
The calculus of healing is the silent grammar of the self. Once mastered, it vanishes, allowing the soul to speak its own poetry.
