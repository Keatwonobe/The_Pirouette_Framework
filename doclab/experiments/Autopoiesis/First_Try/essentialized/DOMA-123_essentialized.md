## Law
The foundational axiom posits that the observed universe's dynamics are described by a Lagrangian, `𝓛_observed`, which deviates from an idealized, ahistorical baseline, `𝓛_model`, by a potential term `V_scar(x)` representing the geometric persistence of past events.

The idealized baseline, or **Null Canvas**, represents a maximally coherent, homogenous, and isotropic universe, governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian:
`𝓛_model = K_τ - V_Γ`
Where `K_τ` is the temporal kinetic term and `V_Γ` is the potential due to ambient Temporal Pressure.

The observed universe, or **Cosmic Palimpsest**, incorporates a spatially-dependent historical potential `V_scar(x)`:
`𝓛_observed(x) = K_τ - (V_Γ + V_scar(x))`

The primary observable is the **Coherence Residual** (`Δ𝓛_p`), calculated as the difference between the observed state inferred from cosmological data (CMB, galaxy surveys) and the idealized model:
`Δ𝓛_p = 𝓛_p(observed) - 𝓛_p(model)`

Substituting the Lagrangian definitions yields the core physical interpretation of the residual map:
`Δ𝓛_p = [K_τ - (V_Γ + V_scar(x))] - [K_τ - V_Γ]`
`∴ Δ𝓛_p ≈ -V_scar(x)`

Thus, a map of the Coherence Residual is a direct measurement of the universe's embedded historical potential.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is falsified if the calculated field `Δ𝓛_p` is statistically indistinguishable from stochastic noise or instrumental error. Its validity requires that the structures within the `Δ𝓛_p` map (a) correlate with observed large-scale structures (filaments, voids) and (b) exhibit predictable, non-random geometries, such as the theorized topological seams of "Phase Fractures," which would constitute direct evidence of primordial phase transitions.

## Philosophy
History is not an abstract narrative of a vanished past, but a persistent and physically potent field (`V_scar`) that is a fundamental term in the universe's present-tense equation of motion. The cosmos does not simply evolve through time; it accretes time as a measurable, structural, and dynamic property. Therefore, what we call "anomalies" are not errors in our models, but the very text of reality, revealing that the substance of the universe is inseparable from its memory.

## Art
We sought the equation for a perfect crystal, but discovered the universe is a stone. The law is not the crystal's symmetry, but the calculus of its scars. The cracks are the scripture.
