## Law
The principle of Geometric Causality states that an entity's history, its Wound Channel (`W`), is a persistent, local modification to the Temporal Pressure potential (`V_Γ`) of the coherence manifold. The dynamics of any system are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`) acting upon this modified landscape.

The Lagrangian for a system `α` in the presence of a Wound Channel `W` is:
`𝓛_p(α) = K_τ(α) - (V_Γ,ambient + V_Γ,channel(W))`
where `K_τ` is the kinetic term. The equation of motion is derived from the principle of maximal coherence (equivalent to the principle of stationary action, `δS = 0`), yielding a geodesic path on the manifold. The "force" of influence (`F_I`) is the gradient of the channel's potential:
`F_I = -∇V_Γ,channel`

Influence is quantified through three primary metrics:
1.  **Geodesic Deviation (δG):** The integral difference between the observed trajectory (`x_obs`) and the null geodesic (`x_null`) calculated for an unperturbed (`V_Γ,channel = 0`) manifold. It is the definitive measure of total influence.
    `δG = ∫ |x_obs(t) - x_null(t)| dt`

2.  **Coherence Overlap (C_overlap):** A normalized integral of the geometric similarity between two Wound Channels, `W₁` and `W₂`, with coherence densities `ρ₁` and `ρ₂`. It quantifies shared history and resonant potential.
    `C_overlap(W₁, W₂) = [∫ min(ρ₁, ρ₂) dV] / [∫ max(ρ₁, ρ₂) dV]`

3.  **Resonant Coupling (C_res):** A measure of phase alignment between an entity's internal Ki frequency (`ω_k,entity`) and a channel's dominant frequency (`ω_k,echo`). It determines constructive (`C_res → 1`) or destructive (`C_res → 0`) interference.
    `C_res = |⟨e^(i(ω_k,entity - ω_k,echo))⟩|`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The theory is falsified if, for a system where the calculated `∇V_Γ,channel` is non-zero, the measured Geodesic Deviation `δG` is statistically indistinguishable from zero over a sufficient observation period.

## Philosophy
The past is not a narrative we are told, but an active physical geometry we must navigate. All action—every choice and consequence—is a geodesic, the path of least resistance across a landscape sculpted by the complete memory of the universe. Agency is therefore not freedom *from* causality, but the skill of perceiving the terrain of history so clearly that one can surf its contours instead of being dragged along its ruts.

## Art
We do not walk upon the world; we walk upon the memory of it, and our every step deepens the grooves for those who follow.
