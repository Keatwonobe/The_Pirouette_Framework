## Law
The framework is subject to empirical validation through three primary falsifiable criteria, derived from its core formalisms.

1.  **The Electron Anomalous Magnetic Moment ($a_e$):** The first-order correction to the electron's g-factor arises from self-interaction within the coherence manifold, a geometric effect. The anomaly is predicted as the product of the interaction strength ($\alpha$, the fine-structure constant) and a fundamental geometric factor ($1/2\pi$) derived from integrating the interaction over a single phase cycle.
    $a_e = \frac{g-2}{2} = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi}$
    *Falsification Criterion:* The theory is falsified if the experimentally measured value of $a_e$ deviates from this prediction beyond the uncertainty in the measured value of $\alpha$.

2.  **Hadronic State Confinement:** The effective potential for bound states, $V_{eff}(r) = a/r + b*r$, predicts a linear relationship between the mass-squared ($M^2$) and the angular momentum ($J$) of particle families (Regge trajectories).
    $M^2(J) = k J + M_0^2$
    *Falsification Criterion:* The theory is falsified if (a) the observed $M^2$ vs. $J$ plots for hadron families are statistically non-linear, or (b) the slope parameter $k$ (derived from the confinement strength $b$) is inconsistent across different families where it should be conserved.

3.  **Information-Coherence Inequality:** The act of observation, which extracts information $I(obs; \phi)$, necessarily perturbs a system's coherence, quantified by a change in its temporal stability parameter, $\Delta T_a$. This trade-off is governed by a fundamental limit, $C$.
    $I(obs; \phi) \cdot \Delta T_a \ge C$
    *Falsification Criterion:* The theory is falsified if any experiment demonstrates the ability to acquire information and induce a coherence loss such that the product $I \cdot \Delta T_a$ is measured to be less than the predicted constant $C$.

## Philosophy
The truth of a formal system is not established by its internal elegance or logical consistency, but by its predictive vulnerability. A theory is only as real as the specific, finite, and fragile points of contact it extends into the physical world, subjecting its entire abstract edifice to the absolute veto of empirical measurement.

## Art
A theorem is a silent bell. To know its truth, you must strike it against the world and listen for the ring.
