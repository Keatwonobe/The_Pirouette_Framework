## Law
Let the state of a system be described by a vector $\psi(t)$ in a state space manifold. The system's dynamics are governed by a Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L}(\psi, \dot{\psi})$, representing its coherence. A stable state $\psi_S$ exists within a local potential well, being a local maximum of the action $S = \int \mathcal{L} dt$.

A **coherence dam**, an exogenous or endogenous constraint, traps the system in this suboptimal equilibrium, $\psi_S$. While trapped, the system accumulates **Temporal Pressure**, $\Gamma(t)$, defined as the integral of unresolved dynamic tension:
$$
\Gamma(t) = \int_0^t (\nabla_{\psi}\mathcal{L}_{global\_max} - \nabla_{\psi}\mathcal{L}_{local\_max}) \cdot \dot{\psi}_{potential} \ d\tau
$$
where $\dot{\psi}_{potential}$ represents the blocked geodesic path.

The dam has a structural integrity threshold, $\Sigma$. A **Coherence Spasm** is a catastrophic phase transition from a Stagnant state ($S_S$) to a Turbulent state ($S_T$) that is initiated when this threshold is breached:
$$
\text{Transition } S_S \to S_T \text{ occurs when } \Gamma(t) > \Sigma
$$
The Turbulent state $S_T$ is characterized by a temporary suspension of the principle of least action. The system's trajectory becomes non-geodesic, exploring the state space stochastically with near-zero Time-Adherence ($T_a \approx 0$). The energy for this exploration is proportional to the released pressure, $\Delta E \propto \Gamma(\text{t}_{\text{spasm}})$.

Following the dissipation of energy, the system re-coalesces into a final state $\psi_f$. The outcome is one of three possibilities:
1.  **Restorative:** $\psi_f \approx \psi_S$ (The system returns to the previous local maximum).
2.  **Transformative:** $\int \mathcal{L}(\psi_f, \dot{\psi}_f) dt > \int \mathcal{L}(\psi_S, \dot{\psi}_S) dt$ (The system finds a new, higher-coherence equilibrium).
3.  **Degenerative:** $\psi_f$ fails to stabilize, remaining in $S_T$, or collapses into a state where $\int \mathcal{L}(\psi_f, \dot{\psi}_f) dt \ll \int \mathcal{L}(\psi_S, \dot{\psi}_S) dt$.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** For any system satisfying the model, the frequency and amplitude of micro-fractures (transient, localized spikes in turbulence) must increase as $\Gamma(t) \to \Sigma$. The absence of such precursors before a catastrophic state transition would invalidate the model.

## Philosophy
Stability is not an absolute good; it can be a prison. Any system can become trapped in a suboptimal equilibrium—a "local maximum" of coherence—where the cost of incremental change is higher than the cost of stasis. In such a state of pathological stability, genuine transformation is impossible through gradual, orderly processes. A violent, system-wide decoherence—a spasm—becomes the only available mechanism for escape and evolution. Therefore, crisis, collapse, and chaos are not necessarily failures of a system, but are often the violent, high-stakes, and metaphysically necessary means by which it searches for a more profound and resilient order.

## Art
The dam mistakes its own stillness for strength, hearing the rising water only as a whisper. But the river remembers the sea, and its memory is the force that will shatter stone to find its way home.
