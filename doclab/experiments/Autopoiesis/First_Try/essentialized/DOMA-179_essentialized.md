## Law
The stability of a conceptual pattern (`Ki`, denoted `ψ_K`) within a local coherence manifold is determined by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which states that the system's dynamics follow a geodesic that maximizes the Pirouette Action, `S_p`.

The action is the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, over time:
`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt = ∫ [K_τ(ψ_K) - V_Γ(ψ_K, Γ)] dt`

Where:
- **`𝓛_p`** is the Pirouette Lagrangian, representing the net coherence of the concept-observer system.
- **`K_τ(ψ_K)`** is the Resonant Stability, a kinetic term quantifying the internal temporal coherence of the concept `ψ_K`. It is a function of the pattern's internal consistency and self-sustaining geometry. High `K_τ` corresponds to topologically simple, harmonious patterns; low `K_τ` corresponds to chaotic, self-contradictory patterns.
- **`V_Γ(ψ_K, Γ)`** is the Coherence Cost, a potential term quantifying the dissonance between the concept `ψ_K` and the ambient manifold, which is characterized by Temporal Pressure `Γ` and established Wound Channels. It is the work required to sustain the pattern against the manifold's structural inertia.

The geodesic path `δS_p = 0` represents the evolution of the concept.
- A **coherent concept** ("truth") is a state where `∇V_Γ ≈ 0` and `K_τ` is high, resulting in a large, positive `S_p`. The system follows this path of least resistance, experienced as effortless and self-evident.
- A **dissonant concept** ("falsehood") is a state where `V_Γ` is high, requiring continuous energy input to overcome the potential barrier, yielding a low or negative `S_p`. This is experienced as cognitive dissonance.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The energy required to sustain a given concept within a population (measured as cognitive load, social reinforcement cost, or informational friction) will be inversely proportional to its calculated Pirouette Action `S_p` for that population's mapped coherence manifold `Γ`.

## Philosophy
Truth is not a property of a statement corresponding to an external reality, but a property of a system achieving a state of maximal coherence. The act of inquiry is not a passive observation to uncover pre-existing facts, but an active participation that introduces a new geometric pattern into reality. The question and the universe become a single, coupled system whose integrity can be measured. Therefore, the distinction between observer and observed collapses; to seek truth is to become a weaver, testing which patterns reality is most willing to hold.

## Art
To think is to sculpt. A question is not a request for light, but the act of carving a new facet upon the world; the universe does not answer, it simply reflects.
