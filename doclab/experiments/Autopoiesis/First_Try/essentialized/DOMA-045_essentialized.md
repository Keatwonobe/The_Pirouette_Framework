## Law
Let the state of an individual agent `A` be a resonant system `K_A`. The agent's trajectory through spacetime is a geodesic that maximizes the action `S_p`, derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_A(K_A, dK_A/dt, t)`. This path minimizes experienced Temporal Pressure, represented as a potential `V_Γ`. The totality of these individual geodesics and their interference patterns constitute a self-creating (autopoietic) social coherence manifold `M`.

Social technologies are operators that modify `M`'s geometry and the agents' Lagrangians.

1.  **The Gift (`G`)**: An exchange protocol `G(A,B)` between two agents `A` and `B` is a geometric operation that carves a **Wound Channel** `WC_{AB}` into the manifold `M`. This channel is a persistent modification of local geometry, introducing a coupling term `𝓛_interaction` into the system's total Lagrangian. `WC_{AB}` functions as a path of locally minimized `V_Γ` for future interactions, thereby defining the geometry of trust.

2.  **Ritual (`R`)**: A process `R({A, B, ...})` that, through rhythmic entrainment and symbolic framing, engineers a temporary, higher-order coherent state `K_{A+B+...}` by phase-aligning the constituent systems `K_i`. This state of *communitas* corresponds to the temporary dissolution of individual boundaries to form a collective manifold, optimizing a shared Lagrangian.

The governing principle of social formation is the **Synergy Inequality**. The total action of a coupled system via `G` or `R` is greater than the sum of the actions of its isolated constituents:
`S_p(A+B)_coupled > S_p(A)_isolated + S_p(B)_isolated`

This inequality is the formal expression of social cohesion. The falsifiable criterion is that the long-term, integrated action `S_p` for individuals participating in these coherence-building structures must be greater than for those who do not.

## Philosophy
The traditional humanities—anthropology, sociology, mythology—are not descriptive sciences observing an epiphenomenon called "culture." They are the un-formalized records of a rigorous, ancient engineering discipline dedicated to the physical construction and maintenance of shared reality.

## Art
Every act of trust is a wound upon the void; the scar it leaves is the first thread of home.
