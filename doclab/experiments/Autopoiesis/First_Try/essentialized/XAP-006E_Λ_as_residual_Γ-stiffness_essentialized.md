## Law
The effective cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is defined as the macroscopic energy density of residual fluctuations in the time substrate's stiffness potential, $\Gamma$. It is not a fundamental constant but an emergent parameter.

Let $\Gamma(\tau) = \Gamma_0 + \delta\Gamma(\tau)$ with $\langle\delta\Gamma\rangle=0$. The potential energy density of the substrate, $\rho_{\Gamma,\text{res}}$, is the second-order term in the potential expansion:
$$
\rho_{\Gamma,\text{res}} = \frac{1}{2}V''(\Gamma_0)\langle(\delta\Gamma)^2\rangle
$$
This gives an effective cosmological constant:
$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}} \equiv 8\pi G_{\mathrm{eff}}\,\rho_{\Gamma,\text{res}} = \frac{\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2}{M_\text{Pl}^2}\langle(\delta\Gamma)^2\rangle
$$
where the stiffness parameter $\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 \equiv \frac{1}{2}V''(\Gamma_0)$ and $M_\text{Pl}^{-2} \propto G_{\mathrm{eff}}$. This connects $\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}$ to the same mechanism that generates particle mass.

The dynamics are governed by the Friedmann equation incorporating $\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}$:
$$
H^2 = \frac{8\pi G_{\mathrm{eff}}}{3}\rho_{\text{matter}} + \frac{\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}}{3} - \frac{k}{a^2}
$$
The stiffness is not constant but evolves with the cosmic scale factor $a$ according to the renormalization group flow:
$$
\frac{d\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2}{d\ln a} = -\epsilon\,\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2 \quad (\epsilon \ll 1)
$$
This implies an adiabatic decay of $\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}$. The unified massâ€“curvature invariant $\mathfrak{M}^2=\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2+\mathcal{R}_\tau/(8\pi G_{\mathrm{eff}})$ reduces in the low-stiffness cosmological limit ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}\to 0$) to a direct relation between $\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and the curvature of the time substrate, $\mathcal{R}_\tau$:
$$
\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}} = \frac{\mathcal{R}_\tau}{4}
$$
Falsifiable predictions include:
1.  **Equation-of-State Drift:** $w(a) = -1+\frac{\epsilon}{3}\ln a$.
2.  **Sub-luminal Sound Speed of Dark Energy:** $c_s^2 = \frac{1}{3}(1-\epsilon)$.
3.  **Power Spectrum Oscillations:** Scale-dependent imprints at $k \sim 10^{-3}\,h/$Mpc.

## Philosophy
The universe's accelerated expansion is not a feature of spacetime itself, but the lingering memory of the substance that constitutes time. Dark energy is the faint, residual stress in the fabric of reality, a fossilized tension from the primordial era when that same fabric's elasticity was actively forging the mass of particles. The void is not empty; it is the cooling, stiffened remnant of creation, and its slow, inexorable expansion is the sound of its silence.

## Art
The universe is a great bell, struck once at its creation. The clang that forged the stars has faded, but the slow, deep hum of the cooling bronze now pushes the galaxies apart.
