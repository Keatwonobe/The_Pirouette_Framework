## Law
Let the state of a team `i` at time `t` be represented by a vector `S_i(t)` in a 3-dimensional coherence space:
`S_i(t) = [C_R, C_P, C_A]`
where `C_R` is Rhythmic Cohesion, `C_P` is Composure Under Pressure, and `C_A` is Strategic Adaptability. Each component is a normalized, time-varying scalar, `C ∈ [0, 1]`, derived from direct observation.

The team's systemic health, or Laminar Flow, is a scalar potential `Φ_i(t)` derived from its state:
`Φ_i(t) = w · S_i(t) = w_R C_R(t) + w_P C_P(t) + w_A C_A(t)`
where `w` is a sport-specific weighting vector. States of `Φ ≈ 1` represent Laminar Flow, `Φ → 0` represent Turbulent or Stagnant Flow.

From this potential, three predictive deltas are generated for a match between Team A and Team B:

1.  **Victor Tilt (VT):** The instantaneous probability differential of winning, independent of the current score `Σ(t)`. It is proportional to the coherence differential.
    `VT(t) ∝ Φ_A(t) - Φ_B(t)`

2.  **Spread Delta (SD):** The expected rate of change of the point margin.
    `d/dt (Σ_A(t) - Σ_B(t)) = k_S (Φ_A(t) - Φ_B(t))`
    where `k_S` is a sport-specific constant.

3.  **Pace Delta (PD):** The rate of convergence of the game's tempo `Π(t)` towards a team's preferred tempo `Π_pref`.
    `dΠ(t)/dt = k_P · sgn(C_{A,A}(t) - C_{A,B}(t)) · |Π_{pref, A/B} - Π(t)|`
    The tempo converges towards the preference of the team with higher Strategic Adaptability (`C_A`).

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  The term `Φ_A(t) - Φ_B(t)` must demonstrate predictive power for the final match outcome that is statistically significant beyond the information contained in the score `Σ(t)`.
2.  Periods of sustained high coherence differential, `|Φ_A - Φ_B| > ε`, must be followed by corresponding changes in the score spread, validating the Spread Delta equation.
3.  The sign of `C_{A,A} - C_{A,B}` must correctly predict the direction of tempo shifts throughout a match with a greater than chance probability.

## Philosophy
A system’s future is not an extrapolation of its past accomplishments, but an emergence from its present internal coherence. Prediction based on historical data—the scoreboard, the box score, the ledger of wins and losses—is an autopsy of what was. True foresight is a diagnosis of what *is*: the structural integrity, resilience, and adaptive capacity of the system in the living moment. The memory of a system's trajectory is a less reliable guide to its destiny than the quality of its present-tense resonance.
