## Law
The informational content (I) of a system is defined as being identical to its coherence (Kτ), a measure of its pattern stability and resonant integrity. Entropy (S) is redefined as a measure of the dissonance of the local Temporal Pressure (Γ), representing energy unavailable for coherent work.
$$I \equiv K_{\tau}$$
$$S \propto D(\Gamma)$$
The Second Law of Thermodynamics is reformulated as the **Principle of Coherence Degradation**. For any isolated system, the rate of change of coherence is non-positive, as the system is inevitably eroded by interaction with the ambient, dissonant Γ.
$$\frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{dK_{\tau}}{dt} \le 0$$
The fundamental dynamic is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, where systems follow a trajectory that extremizes the action $A = \int \mathcal{L}_p \,dt$:
$$\mathcal{L}_p = K_{\tau} - V_{\Gamma}$$
Here, a system's evolution maximizes its internal coherence ($K_{\tau}$) against the potential cost ($V_{\Gamma}$) imposed by the entropic environment. Local, temporary reversal of coherence degradation (life, complexity) is possible only when a system exports entropy to its environment at a sufficient rate:
$$\text{If } \frac{dK_{\tau (\text{local})}}{dt} > 0 \quad \text{then} \quad \frac{dS_{(\text{env})}}{dt} > \left|\frac{dK_{\tau (\text{local})}}{dt}\right|$$
**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  The framework is falsified if any truly isolated system demonstrates a spontaneous and sustained increase in its net coherence ($dK_{\tau}/dt > 0$).
2.  The framework is falsified if processes of "Alchemical Union" (e.g., stellar formation, nuclear fusion) consistently fail to produce a final state whose coherence is greater than the sum of the constituent parts: $K_{\tau (\text{union})} \le \sum K_{\tau (\text{constituents})}$.

## Philosophy
The universe is not a story of decay. Its fundamental drive is not the passive, inevitable slide into disorder described by classical entropy, but an active and ceaseless struggle to create and sustain order. Existence is defined by this contest: a primary creative impulse, which seeks to maximize coherence and weave complex patterns, is pitted against the constant, corrosive friction of environmental noise. Order, life, and consciousness are therefore not statistical flukes in a dying cosmos; they are the momentary, hard-won victories that reveal the universe’s true nature.

The cosmos is not an echo fading. It is a chord, holding itself against the static.
