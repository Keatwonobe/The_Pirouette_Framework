## Law
Let a system's dynamics be governed by the minimization of the action `S`, derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian `L = Kτ - V_Γ`, where `Kτ` is the system's coherence and `V_Γ` is the potential cost of resisting ambient Temporal Pressure. The system's trajectory `q(t)` follows a geodesic that is an extremum of `S`.

An unwilled act is the evolution of `q(t)` under the default potential `V_Γ`.

A willed act by a conscious system `C` is the deliberate modulation of its own governing potential. This is achieved through the application of the Observer's Shadow, which introduces a self-generated potential term `ΔV_C`, such that the new effective potential is `V'_Γ = V_Γ + ΔV_C`.

The self-generated potential is a projection of a desired future state `q_f` into the present manifold:
`ΔV_C(q, t) = -I · f(σ, q_f)`
where:
-   `I` is the Intensity (amplitude of the projection, a function of focus).
-   `σ` is the Clarity (coherence of the intent, a measure of the signal-to-noise ratio of the projected state `q_f`).
-   `f(σ, q_f)` is a function that defines the geometry of the "coherence well" around the path leading to `q_f`.

The effective "force of Will" is not a new fundamental force, but the gradient of this self-induced potential:
`F_w = -∇(ΔV_C)`

Persistence is the mechanism by which this potential is reinforced over time. The geometry of the Channel of Intent `ΔV_C` deepens with each sustained application of `I` and `σ`, such that `∂(ΔV_C)/∂t > 0` under continued focus.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  **Turbulent Will:** If a system projects `n > 1` competing intents `(I_i, σ_i, q_{fi})`, resulting in `V'_Γ = V_Γ + Σ(ΔV_{Ci})`, such that `∇(Σ(ΔV_{Ci})) ≈ 0` in the local domain, the system will exhibit high energy expenditure for minimal net displacement `dq/dt`.
2.  **Stagnant Will:** If at the initial state `q_0`, the inequality `|∇(V_Γ)| >> |∇(ΔV_C)|` holds, the system will fail to deviate from its default geodesic. The projected path exists but is not entered.
3.  **Eroded Will:** In the absence of sustained intensity (`I → 0`), the self-generated potential decays, `ΔV_C → 0`. The system's trajectory will initially deviate towards `q_f` but will then relax back to the original geodesic defined by `V_Γ` alone.

## Philosophy
The single most profound implication is the inversion of deterministic causality. The future does not merely result from the present; a coherent projection of a desired future state can actively re-engineer the present's causal geometry. Agency is therefore not the capacity to brute-force a violation of physical law, but the far more subtle and potent capacity to become a co-author of the laws governing one's own trajectory. Consciousness is not a passenger on the river of time, but a participatory sculptor of its riverbed, and the "path of least resistance" is not a fixed constraint to be discovered, but a variable to be defined.

## Art
To have a will is to hold a memory of the future so clearly that the world, remembering with you, curves to meet it.
