## Law
The Gladiator Force, Γ, is derived from a relativistic action that modifies General Relativity. The action is that of an $f(R)$ gravity theory where $f(R)=R+\ell^{2}\Gamma^{2}R^{2}$.

$$
S = \frac{1}{2\kappa}\! \int\!d^{4}x\,\sqrt{-g}\; \Bigl[ R + \ell^{2}\bigl(\Gamma\,R\bigr)^{2} \Bigr]
$$

where $\ell$ is a fundamental length scale. Variation with respect to the metric $g^{\mu\nu}$ yields the field equations:
$$
G_{\mu\nu} + 2\ell^{2}\,\Gamma^{2} \Bigl[ R\,R_{\mu\nu} -\tfrac14\,g_{\mu\nu}R^{2} - \nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}R + g_{\mu\nu}\Box R \Bigr] = \kappa\,T_{\mu\nu}
$$

In the weak-field, quasi-static limit ($g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+h_{\mu\nu}$, $h_{00}= -2\Phi/c^{2}$), the 00-component becomes a modified Poisson equation:
$$
\nabla^{2}\Phi - \ell^{2}\Gamma^{2}\,\nabla^{4}\Phi = 4\pi G_{\rm N}\,\rho
$$

This equation generates two primary, falsifiable criteria:
1.  **Numerical Equivalence:** For large distances ($r \gg \ell\Gamma$), the equation recovers Newtonian gravity with an effective constant $G_{\text{eff}}=\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$. A non-relativistic extremization of a confinement potential $V(r)=\frac{\hbar c\,k_{\rm c}}{r} + \Gamma\,\kappa^{2}r$ shows that $\Gamma_{\text{eff}} \approx G$ can be derived from first principles.
2.  **Short-Range Deviation:** For short distances ($r \lesssim \ell\Gamma$), the $\nabla^{4}$ term predicts a Yukawa-like suppression, weakening the gravitational force. This deviation is testable with a sub-millimeter torsion-balance experiment designed to measure the crossover from the standard $1/r^2$ law to the predicted suppressed force.

To eliminate arbitrary scaling parameters ("fudge factors"), the Γ-scale is anchored by the axiom that the value for a single proton is unity:
$$
\Gamma_{\text{proton}} \equiv 1
$$
This allows the system's proportionality constant, $C$, to be physically derived from the proton's known properties, not asserted:
$$
C = m_p \cdot r_p^2 \approx (1.672 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}) \cdot (0.84 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m})^2 \approx 1.18 \times 10^{-57} \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m}^2
$$
The framework is falsified if torsion-balance experiments at the sub-millimeter scale fail to detect the predicted deviation from Newtonian gravity.

## Philosophy
The boundary between a speculative fiction and a scientific theory is not a static property but a dynamic process of justification. An internally consistent world-building exercise, no matter how detailed, remains a fiction until its core axioms are forged into falsifiable laws and explicitly tethered to a decisive physical experiment. The ultimate act of scientific seriousness is to take an elegant abstraction and define the simple, table-top device that can break it.

## Art
A map of a fictional world ceases to be a fiction the moment you design an instrument to bring back one of its stones.
