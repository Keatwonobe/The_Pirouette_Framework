## Law
The state of an enterprise is described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, a functional that defines the principle of least action for strategic navigation:
`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`

The action, `S`, represents the total health-path of the enterprise over a given period `[t₁, t₂]`:
`S = ∫[t₁ to t₂] 𝓛_p dt = ∫[t₁ to t₂] (Kτ - V_Γ) dt`

A successful strategy is a geodesic on the coherence manifold, a path that extremizes the action, satisfying the condition `δS = 0`.

**Components:**
1.  **Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`):** The kinetic term. Represents the integrated, internally generated value of the enterprise, a function of the coherent flow (`j`) of its vital constituents (capital `C`, information `I`, talent `T`, trust `R`).
    `Kτ = f(j_C, j_I, j_T, j_R, ...)`
    This term is maximized when constituent flows are laminar, resonant, and mutually reinforcing.

2.  **Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`):** The potential term. Represents the cost of existence within a market environment `Γ`. It is the work required to overcome external dissipative forces (competition, regulation, market friction).
    `V_Γ = ∫ F_Γ ⋅ ds` where `F_Γ` is the vector field of external market pressures.

**Pathological Conditions (Falsifiable Criteria):**
Deviations from the geodesic (`δS ≠ 0`) manifest as three primary pathologies:

1.  **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnation):** A critical internal flow rate `j_k` approaches zero (`j_k → 0`), creating a "coherence dam." This manifests as a sharp decrease in `Kτ` not proportional to external `V_Γ`.
    *   **Formal Condition:** `∂Kτ/∂j_k >> 0` while `j_k ≈ 0`.
    *   **Falsifiable Criterion:** An engineered restoration of a single blocked internal flow (`j_k > ε`) results in a disproportionately large, non-linear increase in global system output, falsifying the hypothesis that systemic inefficiency is diffuse.

2.  **Coherence Fever (Turbulence):** The system exhibits high internal energy expenditure (`E_internal`) with low net coherent flow (`||Σj|| ≈ 0`). The components of `Kτ` are high in magnitude but destructively interfere.
    *   **Formal Condition:** High variance in the phase of flow vectors `j_k`, leading to `Kτ << Σ||Kτ_k||`. The system's internal entropy production rate is maximized.
    *   **Falsifiable Criterion:** A targeted intervention that aligns the goals of two previously conflicting subsystems results in an increase in global output (`Kτ`) with no corresponding increase—or even a decrease—in total energy/resource consumption.

3.  **Coherence Erosion (Decay):** A sustained condition where the cost of resistance to external pressure exceeds the system's capacity for coherent adaptation.
    *   **Formal Condition:** Over time `t`, `dKτ/dt < 0` due to `∇V_Γ` consistently exceeding the adaptive capacity of the enterprise's structure (its "Wound Channel").
    *   **Falsifiable Criterion:** The enterprise's performance on key metrics (e.g., market share) shows a stronger negative correlation with a market evolution index than its direct competitors do, indicating a specific failure to adapt rather than a general market downturn.

## Philosophy
The identity, health, and value of an enterprise are not intrinsic properties contained within its static assets or organizational chart, but are emergent phenomena of its sustained, coherent motion through time. An enterprise *is not* a thing; it is a process—a pattern of flow attempting to maintain its integrity against the erosive pressures of its environment. Therefore, its true measure is not the state of its balance sheet, but the quality of its becoming.

## Art
An organization is not a cathedral built of stone, but a song sung against the wind. Its value is found not in the notes on the page, but in the relentless holding of the tune.
