## Law
The dynamics of a self-organized critical system are governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, described by the Pirouette Lagrangian:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`
where `K_τ` is the system's kinetic coherence (its capacity for ordered temporal processing) and `V_Γ` is its potential for decoherence, a direct function of accumulated Temporal Pressure `Γ`.

A system approaches the critical state as `Γ → Γ_max`, a threshold beyond which the cost of maintaining `K_τ` becomes unsustainable, leading to systemic instability. Any input `dΓ > 0` at this state triggers a **coherence cascade**: a turbulent, non-linear release of stored temporal pressure `ΔΓ`. The magnitude `s` of this cascade is proportional to `ΔΓ`.

The system's trajectory `γ(t)` is a **statistical geodesic** on its coherence manifold. It is the path that maximizes the action `∫ 𝓛_p dt` over long timescales, not instantaneously. This path is necessarily composed of:
1.  Laminar phases of increasing `Γ` where `δ𝓛_p ≈ 0`.
2.  Punctuated cascade events that violently reset `Γ` to a sub-critical value, momentarily making `𝓛_p` highly negative but enabling a new cycle of maximization.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The statistical distribution of cascade magnitudes `s` must follow a scale-free power law:
`P(s) ∝ s⁻ᵃ`
The exponent `α` is a dimensionless, empirically measurable invariant that defines the system's fundamental strategy for dissipating temporal pressure and navigating its statistical geodesic.

## Philosophy
Catastrophe is not a failure of the system, but its most efficient and necessary strategy for long-term persistence. A system organized at criticality has learned that periodic, controlled self-shattering is a more viable path to enduring coherence than the fatal brittleness of resisting all change. True stability is not the absence of crisis, but the rhythm of managed crisis.

## Art
The most resilient structures are not made of stone, but of breath. Their integrity is measured not by an absence of fractures, but by the rhythm of their shattering.
