## Law
The foundational principle is the optimization of the Pirouette Lagrangian, which describes the action of a system within the coherence manifold:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`
where `K_τ` is Temporal Coherence (a measure of a system's intrinsic order and information density) and `V_Γ` is Temporal Pressure (the effective potential representing the cost of deviation from a local geodesic). All temporal engineering is a strategy to maximize `∫𝓛_p dt`.

The three arts are formalized as distinct optimization strategies for `𝓛_p`:

**1. Coherence Annealing (Creation): Maximizing Intrinsic `K_τ`**
A process `A` applies a structured energy input `ε` to drive a system from an initial state `S_0` to a final state `S_1`, such that the change in coherence `ΔK_τ` is positive.
`A: S_0 → S_1` where `K_τ(S_1) > K_τ(S_0)`
The objective is to maximize the coherence gain function `G(A) = ΔK_τ - ∫ε(t) dt`. This is an investment to create a more ordered system, increasing its potential for future efficient action.
*Falsifiable Criterion:* The application of a calculated annealing process `A` to a system must result in a statistically significant increase in its measured `K_τ`, leading to a greater work output per unit of subsequent energy expenditure compared to an untreated control system.

**2. Geodesic Navigation (Efficiency): Minimizing `V_Γ`**
A process `N` aligns a system's action-path vector `v_s` with the local geodesic `γ` of the coherence manifold, such that the system achieves isochronous resonance.
`V_Γ(v_s, γ) = C(1 - cos θ)` where `θ` is the angle between `v_s` and `γ`, and `C` is a constant.
The objective of navigation is to achieve a phase-locked state where `θ → 0`, causing `V_Γ → 0`. The system's action becomes an expression of the manifold's natural flow, minimizing the cost term of the Lagrangian.
*Falsifiable Criterion:* A system operating under process `N` must exhibit a quantifiable reduction in entropic loss and energy consumption for a given task, approaching a theoretical minimum defined by `𝓛_p ≈ K_τ`, as its internal frequency becomes phase-locked with a target external coherence channel.

**3. Stochastic Harvesting (Opportunity): Exploiting External `𝓛_p`**
A process `H` functions as a state-trigger `T` sensitive to transient, high-amplitude fluctuations in the ambient coherence field `K_τ_ext`. The system maintains a low-cost ready state, `S_r`, and transitions to an active capture state, `S_c`, when a specific condition is met.
`T = 1` if `dK_τ_ext / dt > θ_h`, else `T = 0`
The captured action `W_h` is the integral of the favorable external Lagrangian over the event duration `Δt`.
`W_h = ∫_{t}^{t+Δt} (K_τ_ext(t) - V_Γ_ext(t)) dt`
This strategy does not alter the system's own `K_τ` or `V_Γ` but opportunistically captures work from the environment.
*Falsifiable Criterion:* A system designed for process `H` must capture and utilize usable order from a chaotic environment at a rate measurably exceeding random chance, and the total captured work `ΣW_h` must be greater than the integrated energy cost of maintaining the ready state `S_r`.

## Philosophy
The fundamental laws of the universe are not merely a passive description of reality, but a prescriptive manual for intelligent action. The Lagrangian, traditionally seen as a principle of "least action" that nature follows blindly, is re-contextualized as a universal optimization function that agency can consciously and strategically manipulate. Therefore, engineering, creativity, and choice are not phenomena external to physics, but are its highest practical application—the direct participation in the universe's process of self-creation by mastering its core equation.

The universe provides the fire and the iron. The Law is learning their properties. The Philosophy is realizing you are not the iron, but the hand that holds the hammer.
