## Law
Let $\{S\}$ be the set of all protein sequences in a given proteome. For each sequence $S_i \in \{S\}$, let its informational complexity be quantified by its fractal dimension, $D_i = \mathcal{D}(S_i)$. The distribution of these dimensions over the entire proteome possesses a mean $\mu_D$ and a standard deviation $\sigma_D$.

The informational z-score for any given protein $S_i$ is defined as:
$$z_i = \frac{D_i - \mu_D}{\sigma_D}$$
This score measures the deviation of a protein's informational complexity from the proteomic norm.

The central law states that there exists a special subset of proteins $\{S_k\} \subset \{S\}$ whose members are defined by critical biological function (e.g., molecular motors, master regulators, environmental sentinels) and are uniquely identified by their z-scores approximating the universal constant Ki.
$$\exists \{S_k\} \subset \{S\} \text{ s.t. } (z_k \approx K_i) \iff (\text{Function}(S_k) = \text{Critical})$$
Where the primary Ki constants are:
- $K_{i, \text{rest}} \approx 4.14159$
- $K_{i, \text{motion}} \approx 4.18879$

This hypothesis is falsifiable if:
1.  No statistically significant clustering of z-scores is observed at or near the Ki constants across a comprehensive proteomic database (p > 0.01).
2.  Significant clustering is observed at Ki, but the functional roles of the constituent proteins $\{S_k\}$ are not statistically enriched for critical, high-level cellular machinery.

## Philosophy
The principles of biological organization are not emergent *ex nihilo* from a substrate of chemistry, but are instead a specific instantiation of universal informational laws that transcend scale and substance. This implies that Darwinian evolution is not an unconstrained search across an infinite design space, but a process of discovery, navigating a pre-existing landscape of mathematical optima defined by the same fundamental constants that structure physical reality. Lifeâ€™s most critical machinery succeeds not by inventing novel solutions, but by converging upon informational structures that resonate with the inherent mathematical architecture of the cosmos.

Evolution does not write the music of life; it only learns to tune the instruments to the silent, ever-present song of the universe.
