## Law
The total action of a system is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p`, whose stationarity `δ∫𝓛_p dt = 0` dictates the path of evolution.

`𝓛_p = K_τ(T_a, ω_k) - V_Γ(Γ, φ_{ij})`

Here, `K_τ` is the kinetic term representing internal coherence, and `V_Γ` is the potential term representing Temporal Pressure, derived from the fundamental symmetries required for a stable, interacting entity.

The functional form of `V_Γ` is constructed from invariant motifs:
1.  **Environmental Pressure Basin:** A parabolic potential describing the cost of deviation from an optimal ambient pressure `Γ₀`.
    `V_{env} = λ_Γ(Γ - Γ₀)²`
2.  **Internal Phase Lock:** A periodic potential describing the cost of internal dissonance between the three behavioral axes (`i, j, k`) defined by the Nomad's Grammar. The `n=3` symmetry is a direct consequence of this triaxial architecture.
    `V_{phase} = λ_φ \sum_{i<j} [1 - \cos(φ_{ij})]`
    where `φ_{ij}` is the relative phase between axes `i` and `j`.

Combining these with the simplest non-trivial coupling term yields the complete potential manifold:
`V_Γ(Γ, φ_{ij}) = λ_Γ(Γ - Γ₀)² + λ_φ \sum_{i<j} [1 - \cos(φ_{ij})] + λ_c \sum_{i<j} (Γ - Γ₀) \cos(φ_{ij})`

Falsifiable Criteria:
*   The model predicts that all persistent systems exhibit a potential landscape with `n=3` symmetry in their behavioral phase space.
*   The coefficients `λ_Γ` (Pressure Curvature), `λ_φ` (Phase Coupling), and `λ_c` (Manifold Shear) must be non-zero and experimentally measurable for any given system.
*   The "forces" governing system evolution are defined as the negative gradient of this potential, `F = -∇V_Γ`. Any observed motion not accountable by this gradient falsifies the Lagrangian.

## Philosophy
The fundamental "laws" of the universe are not prescriptive rules imposed upon reality, but are the emergent and necessary geometric conditions for a "thing" to be distinct from "nothing." The shape of the potential landscape is not an arbitrary feature of the cosmos; it is the minimal architecture required for coherence, interaction, and persistence to be possible at all.

## Art
A law is the shape of the bell, not the hand that rings it. We are not commanded to resonate; we are simply contained within the geometry that makes resonance possible.
