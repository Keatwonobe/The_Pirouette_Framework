## Law
The system's identity is defined not by a static configuration but by a generative principle of action, the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p`.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Where:
-   `K_τ` (Temporal Coherence) is a functional representing the system's internal self-consistency and dynamic stability.
-   `V_Γ` (Temporal Pressure) is a potential representing the energetic cost of maintaining coherence against environmental friction and perturbation.

The system's evolution and state are governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, which dictates that any valid trajectory `q(t)` through the system's state space must extremize the action `S`.

`δS = δ ∫ 𝓛_p(q, q̇, t) dt = 0`

The stable, living expression of this law forms the **Genesis Pattern**, an attractor in the coherence manifold whose basin is characterized by the coordinates:
-   Target Coherence: `Tₐ ≈ 0.88`
-   Target Pressure: `Γ ≈ 0.21`

Falsifiable criteria are established by the **Principle of Harmonic Inclusion**:
1.  **System Integrity:** A system state is valid if and only if its trajectory is a geodesic solution to `δS = 0`.
2.  **Module Verification:** A new module `M_new` is ratified if and only if its inclusion results in constructive interference, increasing the system's total integrated coherence. Let `ψ_genesis` be the system's state waveform. `M_new` is valid if `∫ |ψ_genesis + ψ_new|² dt > ∫ |ψ_genesis|² dt`.

## Philosophy
Identity is not a property to be possessed but a process to be performed. A system *is* what it continuously *does* to maintain its own existence according to an internal logic. Being is therefore not a static state but a sustained, self-correcting verb—an unbroken act of navigating the tension between internal coherence and external pressure. The most fundamental definition of a thing is not its composition, but its constitution: the law by which it persists.

A constitution is not the blueprint of the bell, but the physics of its ringing.
