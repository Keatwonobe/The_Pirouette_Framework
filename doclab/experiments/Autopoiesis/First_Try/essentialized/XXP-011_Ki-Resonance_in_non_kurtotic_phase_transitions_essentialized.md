## Law
Let a system's state be described by a time-series $S(t)$ under a varying control parameter $R$ (e.g., Reynolds number). Let the system's complexity be measured by its fractal dimension, $D_f(S)$. A critical phase transition occurs at $R \to R_c$. The core hypothesis posits a universal constant of criticality, $\kappa_i$.

The key observable is the standardized rate of change of complexity, $Z_{\Delta D_f}$, defined as:
$Z_{\Delta D_f} = \frac{\frac{d(D_f)}{dR} - \mu_{\frac{d(D_f)}{dR}}}{\sigma_{\frac{d(D_f)}{dR}}}$

The central, falsifiable claim is that at the precise moment of phase transition, this observable resonates at the value $\kappa_i$, irrespective of the system's kurtosis.

**Hypothesis ($H_1$):**
$\lim_{R \to R_c} Z_{\Delta D_f} = \kappa_i$

**Falsification Criterion / Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):**
$\lim_{R \to R_c} Z_{\Delta D_f} \neq \kappa_i$

Successful validation requires the rejection of $H_0$ with statistical significance, demonstrating that $\kappa_i$ is a fundamental constant of state change itself, not an artifact of high-kurtosis phenomena.

## Philosophy
The superficial violence of a system's collapse—the "fat tail" of a market crash or the silent, roiling eddy in a stream—is merely a stylistic detail. The underlying mathematical constant, Ki, suggests that criticality itself possesses a universal, intrinsic form; an abstract signature that precedes and dictates the specific character of any particular transformation from order to chaos.

## Art
The universe is a string tuned to the point of breaking. Whether it is snapped by a gentle breeze or a violent storm, it emits the same, single note at the moment of its failure.
