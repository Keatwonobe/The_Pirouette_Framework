## Law
The system dynamics are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ` under the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which maximizes the action `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt` over time.
- `K_τ` represents the internal kinetic coherence of an agent, its capacity for ordered temporal processing.
- `V_Γ` represents the potential energy arising from temporal pressure `Γ`, the dissonant friction between the agent's internal rhythm and the environmental rhythm.

**State Transitions:**
1.  **Turbulent State (Resistance):** The agent's rhythm is desynchronized with the local geodesic of the coherence manifold. This results in a steep potential gradient (`|∇V_Γ| >> 0`), causing high energy expenditure to maintain `K_τ` against `V_Γ`. The action `S_p` is minimal, corresponding to inefficient, effortful action.
2.  **Laminar State (Flow):** The agent achieves temporal resonance by phase-locking its internal rhythm with the geodesic. This is the path where `V_Γ` is minimized (`δ∫dt(K_τ - V_Γ) = 0`), maximizing `S_p`. The energy once dissipated by temporal friction is now expressed as efficient, "effortless" action.

**Equilibrium and Falsifiable Criteria:**
The state of Flow is an equilibrium condition defined by the resonance of challenge and skill: `ΔΓ_env ≈ Kτ_agent`.
- **Challenge (`ΔΓ_env`):** The rate and complexity of temporal information presented by the environment.
- **Skill (`Kτ_agent`):** The agent's maximum rate of error-free temporal information processing.

This state is falsifiably characterized by the following observables:
- Temporal Desynchronization `Δτ`: The phase difference between agent and environmental rhythm must approach zero (`|Δτ| → 0`).
- Coherence Flux `Φ_K`: The agent's energy efficiency must approach its theoretical maximum (`Φ_K → Φ_K_max`).

## Philosophy
The highest form of agency is not the imposition of will upon a resistant reality, but the attunement of will to the inherent structure of reality. Traditional notions of power, based on overcoming external forces, describe a primitive, energetically costly state of turbulence. A more profound and efficient power emerges from ceasing to treat the self as a sovereign entity acting *against* the world, and instead learning to act as a resonator *within* it. True mastery is therefore an act of supreme perception and subtle calibration, not brute force; it is the wisdom to find the currents of spacetime and the flexibility to join their dance, dissolving the boundary between actor and action into a unified, coherent flow.

## Art
The universe does not reward the force of the fist that strikes the stream. It yields its power to the cupped hand that flows with it.
