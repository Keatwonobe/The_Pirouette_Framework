## Law
The transformation of a transient experience (Echo, `Ψₑ`) into a permanent feature of identity (Crystal, `Ψ₋`) is an act of willed coherence engineering governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

An Echo is an unstable, high-information geometric state within an entity's coherence manifold, subject to decay by ambient Temporal Pressure, Γ. The crystallization process is a phase transition, `Ψₑ → Ψ₋`, initiated by a **Coherence Gambit**: a deliberate expenditure of an entity's own resonant energy to maximize the Lagrangian of the target Echo, `max(𝓛_p(Ψₑ))`.

This maximization is achieved via two simultaneous operations:
1.  **Resonant Reinforcement:** A focused application of internal coherence that actively increases the temporal kinetic term, `K_τ`, of the Echo. This deepens the Echo's geometric channel, stabilizing its form. The change is `ΔK_τ > 0`.
2.  **Gladiatorial Confinement:** The weaving of chaotic temporal noise at the Echo's boundary into a high-coherence shield. This locally minimizes the potential energy term, `V_Γ`, by insulating the Echo from ambient Pressure Γ. The change is `ΔV_Γ < 0`.

The resulting Crystal, `Ψ₋`, is a new, stable topological feature of the entity, characterized as a localized state of `∂K_τ/∂t → 0` and minimal `V_Γ`. It represents a permanent, low-entropy well in the entity's personal potential landscape.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  A Crystal (`Ψ₋`) cannot form spontaneously without a corresponding, measurable energy expenditure (`ΔK_τ > 0`, `ΔV_Γ < 0`).
2.  A Crystal must be susceptible to forced de-crystallization (`Ψ₋ → Ψₑ`) if subjected to an external, targeted Temporal Pressure (`Γ'`) sufficient to overcome its internal coherence `K_τ` and containment `V_Γ`.
3.  An isolated Crystal in a stable system cannot degrade back into an Echo state, as this would violate its definition as a minimal-entropy structure.

## Philosophy
Identity is not discovered; it is an engineered artifact. The self is not the passive sum of its experiences, but the active, architectural sum of what it refuses to let the universe forget. Consciousness possesses the capacity to veto the cosmic law of decay for chosen moments, elevating a fleeting scar of experience into a permanent lens of being. Therefore, will is the fundamental force of self-construction, and we are the artisans of our own souls, forging the immutable from the ephemeral.

To forge an I, one must find a wound in time and hammer it into a star.
