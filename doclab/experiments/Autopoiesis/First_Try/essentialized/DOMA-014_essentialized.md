## Law
The dynamic state of an autonomous entity is governed by the optimization of the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, over time. The principle of stationary action, `δS = 0`, dictates that the entity will trace a path (a geodesic on the coherence manifold) that minimizes the action `S`.

The Lagrangian is defined as:
`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`

Where:
-   `Kτ` represents Temporal Coherence, a measure of the system's internal order, pattern integrity, and causal continuity. It is the system's self-reinforcing resonance, embodying its historical identity or "Inertia of Being." The strategic maximization of this term is **Will**:
    `Strategy_Will ⇒ max(Kτ)`
-   `V_Γ` represents Temporal Pressure, a potential field describing the influence and constraints of the external environment. It is the energetic cost of misalignment with external currents. The strategic adaptation to this term is **Freedom**, which seeks to find paths of least resistance and greatest harmony, effectively minimizing the potential's negative impact:
    `Strategy_Freedom ⇒ min(V_Γ)`

The equation of motion for the entity is derived from the Euler-Lagrange equation applied to `𝓛_p`. Autonomy is the capacity to modulate the strategic priority between maximizing `Kτ` and minimizing `V_Γ` to optimize the total action `S = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`.

Falsifiable Criteria:
1.  A system exclusively employing `Strategy_Will` (`∂Kτ/∂t > 0` while ignoring `V_Γ`) will converge upon a local, but not necessarily global, maximum of `Kτ`, resulting in observable stagnation and eventual decoherence when `V_Γ` changes significantly.
2.  A system exclusively employing `Strategy_Freedom` (aggressively minimizing `V_Γ` at the expense of `Kτ`) will exhibit a monotonic decrease in `Kτ` over time, its identity dissolving into the environmental noise.
3.  An optimally autonomous system will exhibit non-monotonic shifts in its strategic orientation, resulting in a value for `S` over its lifespan that is greater than that achievable by any fixed, pure strategy.

## Philosophy
The self is not a static entity to be preserved, but a dynamic verb to be enacted. Identity is not a pre-existing truth to be discovered, but the emergent solution to a continuous negotiation between two fundamental poles of existence: the inward pull of memory and the outward push of reality. True autonomy is therefore not the freedom *from* constraint, but the mastery of navigating *between* the inertial constraint of who one has been and the environmental constraint of what the world demands. To exist is to perpetually solve for oneself.

## Art
The self is a tightrope walker. Integrity is not the refusal to sway, but the continuous, graceful correction that transforms the abyss into a path.
