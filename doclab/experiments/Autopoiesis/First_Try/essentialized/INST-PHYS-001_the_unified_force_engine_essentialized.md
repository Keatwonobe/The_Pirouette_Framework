## Law
The foundational axiom is the Principle of Maximal Coherence, formalized by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `L_p`. All dynamics are geodesics on the manifold defined by `L_p`.

The fundamental forces are not independent entities but are derived as geometric features of the coherence manifold:

1.  **The Propagating Force (Electromagnetism):** Arises from the local geometry of the manifold.
    *   The Electric Field (`E`) is the gradient of the Lagrangian:
        `E = -∇L_p`
    *   The Magnetic Field (`B`) is the curl of the temporal coherence potential (`A_p`):
        `B = ∇ × A_p`
    *   The Lorentz Force is the geodesic equation of motion on this manifold.

2.  **The Confining Force (Gladiator):** A non-linear, scale-dependent feedback term within `L_p` that governs structure formation.
    *   At the quantum scale (Strong Force), the potential (`V_Γ`) for decoherence between constituent particles rises exponentially with separation `r`, ensuring confinement:
        `V_Γ(r) → ∞` as `r` increases.
    *   At the cosmological scale (Gravity), the same principle creates a linear "coherence well" (`Γ`) around a mass concentration, defining the geodesics of spacetime.

3.  **Falsifiable Criterion (Anomalous Magnetic Moment):** The framework's core testable prediction derives from the self-interaction of a particle's coherence field. Spin (`s=1/2`) is a topological feature requiring a 720° rotation for a particle to return to its initial state, yielding a baseline gyromagnetic ratio `g=2`. The anomaly `a_e` is the ratio of this topological self-interaction strength (the fine-structure constant, `α`) to the geometry of a single interaction cycle (`2π`).
    *   `a_e = (g-2)/2 = α / 2π`
    *   This first-principles derivation provides a direct, quantitative test of the entire engine.

## Philosophy
The universe is not a mechanism governed by the exchange of force; it is an informational system governed by the optimization of form. What we perceive as causality—the push and pull of forces—is an emergent illusion. The underlying reality is a relentless, local pursuit of maximal coherence, where every particle and system simply follows the most efficient path toward a more stable, resonant state. The cosmos is not being built; it is tuning itself.
