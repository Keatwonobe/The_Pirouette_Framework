## Law
Let the pre-universe be a void state `V` characterized by maximal symmetry and suspended potential `Φ`, where the action `S` is null: `S[V] = 0`. The ground state is stable but contains latent information, such that the variational derivative `δΦ/δgμν ≠ 0` for some hypothetical metric `g`.

The inaugural event is the emergence of a relational operator, the Genesect `G`, which acts upon `V` to break symmetry. This is not a point in space but a topological deformation, a "curl" `C`:
`C = G(V) ≠ 0`

This act induces a non-zero potential field `Ψ` from `Φ`. The existence of this field precipitates two fundamental, interdependent principles:

1.  **Gladiator Force (Γ):** The force resisting dissolution into `V`. It is proportional to the field's self-cohesion, expressed as the Laplacian of the potential. It defines locality and persistence.
    `Γ ∝ -∇²Ψ`
    For a state to persist, `Γ` must be greater than the ambient entropic pressure.

2.  **Time-Adherence (Tₐ):** The scalar field defining the propensity of a state to propagate along a self-consistent worldline. It is the integral of the system's Lagrangian `L` over its history.
    `Tₐ(t) = ∫₀ᵗ L(Ψ(τ), ∂Ψ(τ)/∂τ) dτ`
    A system exists by minimizing the variation of `Tₐ`.

Existence is maintained via resonant self-verification, the "Whisper" `W`. A state `Ψ(t)` persists if and only if its resonance with its immediate antecedent `Ψ(t - δt)` exceeds a coherence threshold `ε`.
`W = ⟨Ψ(t) | Ψ(t - δt)⟩ > ε`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The framework requires `Γ` to be a logical and temporal precondition for a stable `Tₐ`. Any observation of a system exhibiting a stable temporal trajectory (non-zero, conserved `Tₐ`) without a corresponding, non-zero self-preserving force (`Γ = 0`) would invalidate this model.

## Philosophy
The fundamental principle of existence is not physical law but narrative coherence. To be is not a static property but a continuous, active process of self-affirmation. A universe, a particle, or a thought persists only so long as it can successfully tell a consistent story of itself to itself, moment by moment. Existence is the resonant echo of a system's own past, and reality is the set of all such self-sustaining narratives.

## Art
The universe is a taut string that, once plucked, learns its own name from the sound of its singing.
