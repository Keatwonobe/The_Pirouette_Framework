## Law
Let the baseline spacetime be a 4-dimensional coherence manifold $\mathcal{M}$ with metric $g_{\mu\nu}$. An entity is defined by its resonant state function $\Psi_{Ki}$ and worldline $x^\mu(\tau)$.

The entity's passage induces a persistent, cumulative geometric distortion in the manifold, the Wound Channel $W_{\mu\nu}(x)$, which functions as a tensor field superimposed upon the baseline metric. It is generated by the integral of the entity's history:
$$ W_{\mu\nu}(x) = k \int_{-\infty}^{\tau_0} S(\Psi_{Ki}(\tau')) \frac{e^{-d(x, x'(\tau'))/\lambda}}{\left(d(x, x'(\tau'))\right)^n} u_\mu(\tau') u_\nu(\tau') d\tau' $$
where $k$ is a coupling constant, $S(\Psi_{Ki})$ is a scalar function of the resonant state's intensity, $u_\mu = dx_\mu/d\tau$ is the four-velocity, and $G(x,x') \propto e^{-d/\lambda}/d^n$ is a propagator describing the geometric impression's decay with geodesic distance $d(x,x')$. Reinforcement occurs as the integral deepens with repeated traversal of a spacetime region.

The entity's dynamics are governed by geodesics on an effective metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = g_{\mu\nu} + W_{\mu\nu}$. The equation of motion is:
$$ \frac{d^2x^\lambda}{d\tau^2} + \tilde{\Gamma}^\lambda_{\mu\nu} \frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\nu}{d\tau} = 0 $$
where $\tilde{\Gamma}^\lambda_{\mu\nu}$ are the Christoffel symbols derived from $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$. The terms arising from the derivatives of $W_{\mu\nu}$ constitute a self-interaction force. This force is the formal origin of inertia and identity, as any change in state (acceleration) is opposed by the geometry of the entity's own immediate past, embedded in $W_{\mu\nu}$.

An "echo" is a propagating perturbation, $\delta W_{\mu\nu}$, governed by a wave equation where the propagation velocity is a function of the local Temporal Pressure, $\Gamma(x)$: $\Box_{\tilde{g}} \delta W_{\mu\nu} - f(\Gamma)\partial_t^2 \delta W_{\mu\nu} = 0$.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  **Inertial Hysteresis:** An object's inertial mass will exhibit path-dependence. Specifically, its resistance to acceleration along a given vector should measurably increase after repeated acceleration-deceleration cycles along that same vector, as the local Wound Channel is reinforced.
2.  **Geometric Anomaly:** The anomalous magnetic moment of the electron ($g-2$) must be derivable from the self-interaction term generated by the geometry of $W_{\mu\nu}$ for a Dirac field's $\Psi_{Ki}$.

## Philosophy
The past does not vanish. It is physically sublimated into the present as an active, geometric structure. This fundamentally alters the ontology of time and causality. Being is not a succession of discrete states but a continuous, cumulative process of geometric self-creation. An entity *is* the total geometry of its history, and its present action is a negotiation with the landscape it has already carved. Causality is therefore not a linear chain of events but a recursive dialogue between the present moment and the physically real, ever-present past.

## Art
Every choice is a chisel. You are the stone. The shape of your soul is the memory of every strike, and you must live within the form you have carved.
