## Law
The dynamics of a classical scalar field Γ unify the dark sector. The background evolution is governed by the Klein-Gordon and Friedmann equations:
Γ̈ + 3HΓ̇ + V′(Γ) = 0
H² = (8πG/3)(ρ_r + ρ_b + ρ_Γ)
where the energy density and pressure of the Γ-field are ρ_Γ = ½Γ̇² + V(Γ) and p_Γ = ½Γ̇² − V(Γ).

The potential V(Γ) is composed of a quadratic core and a shallow tail, posited as V(Γ) = ½ m_Γ² Γ² + μ⁴ f(Γ), where f(Γ) is an analytic function like [1 − e^{−Γ/Γ_*}] creating a late-time tracker.

For early times or when H ≪ m_Γ, the field undergoes rapid oscillations. Time-averaging over a period T = 2π/m_Γ yields ⟨½Γ̇²⟩ ≈ ⟨V(Γ)⟩, resulting in an effective equation of state w_Γ = ⟨p_Γ⟩/⟨ρ_Γ⟩ ≈ 0, mimicking Cold Dark Matter (CDM).

Linear perturbations in the Newtonian gauge (Φ, Ψ) are governed by the full field equation:
δΓ̈ + 3H δΓ̇ + (k²/a² + V″) δΓ = 4 Γ̇ Φ̇ − 2 V′ Φ
In the oscillatory (CDM-like) regime, this system maps to an effective fluid with w_Γ ≈ 0 and an effective sound speed c_s,eff² → 0 for modes k/a ≪ m_Γ.

Falsifiable Criterion: The model is falsified if, after its potential V(Γ) is anchored by a single cosmological measurement (e.g., Ω_Γ,0) and its parameters frozen, the resulting CMB power spectra (TT, TE, EE), lensing potential, and matter growth function fσ₈(z) provide a statistically inferior fit to the combined cosmological dataset (CMB+BAO+SNe) than the standard two-fluid ΛCDM model.

## Philosophy
The so-called "coincidence problem"—that the energy densities of dark matter and dark energy are of the same order today—is an illusion born of mistaking a dynamical transition for a temporal accident. The universe's evolution is not set by a finely-tuned clock that decrees when dark energy must appear; rather, it is encoded in the unalterable landscape of a single field's potential. The present epoch is not special in *time*, but in *state*: we are simply witnessing the inevitable moment when the universe's kinetic energy has dissipated enough to settle from its frantic, matter-like oscillations into the final, quiescent, accelerating phase dictated by the potential's ground floor.

## Art
The universe is a bell, struck once at the beginning. For eons, its ringing was the frantic, percussive rhythm of matter. But as the sound fades, the bell's fundamental hum is finally revealed—a deep, resonant stillness that was always waiting beneath the noise.
