## Law
The dynamics of belief change are governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, where a cognitive system evolves along a path that maximizes its integrated coherence over time. The core formalization is an extension of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛`).

The change in a participant's belief state is a function of a new potential term, `V_gambit`, introduced into their coherence landscape:
`𝓛_new = K_τ(q, q̇) - (V_Γ(q) + V_gambit(q, k_i))`
where:
- `q` is a vector representing the state of the participant's belief manifold.
- `K_τ` is the kinetic term, representing the inertia or momentum of existing beliefs (Wound Channels).
- `V_Γ` is the potential of unresolved cognitive dissonance or Temporal Pressure (`Γ`).
- `V_gambit` is the potential well introduced by the persuasive act. Its geometry is a function of the participant's state `q` and the specific structure of the message, the Observer's Shadow `k_i`.

A successful gambit occurs when the action integral `S = ∫𝓛_new dt` is maximized by a trajectory leading into the `V_gambit` potential well. This manifests as a subjective experience of insight.

**Falsifiable Criteria (Conditions for Resonance Failure):**
The model is falsified if a belief change does not occur despite a theoretically optimal `V_gambit`. The theory predicts failure under three specific conditions, which are defined as diagnostic signals, not "resistance":
1.  **Harmonic Mismatch:** The message's core pattern, `k_i`, is orthogonal or dissonant to the participant's foundational belief vectors, resulting in a repulsive or negligible `V_gambit`.
2.  **Inertial Dominance:** The kinetic energy `K_τ` of the existing Wound Channel is significantly greater than the potential depth of `V_gambit`. The cost of changing trajectory outweighs the perceived coherence gain (`ΔS < 0`).
3.  **Signal Obscuration:** The ambient potential `V_Γ` is high and chaotic, such that the signal-to-noise ratio renders `V_gambit` undetectable by the participant's system.

## Philosophy
The most profound philosophical implication is that influence is not an act of coercion but an act of co-creation. It reframes persuasion from a zero-sum conflict of wills to a collaborative shaping of reality. The ethical axis of influence is therefore shifted from intent (manipulation vs. sincerity) to outcome: a persuasive act is moral if and only if it results in a state of higher, shared coherence (Alchemical Union) for all participants. An act that increases the influencer's coherence at the expense of the influenced is, by definition, an act of metaphysical violence—the creation of a parasitic dissonance.
