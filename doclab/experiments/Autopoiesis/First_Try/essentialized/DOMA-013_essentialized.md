## Law
The dynamics of influence are governed by the interaction between a projected pattern (the Current) and a responding system's attempt to maintain internal stability (the Echo). This interaction is described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`).

1.  **The Current (`C`):** An entity `A` with internal temporal coherence `Kτ_A` projects its resonant pattern `Ki_A` by modulating the local temporal pressure `Γ`. This projection, the Current `C_A`, propagates as a geometric deformation of the coherence manifold, functionally altering the potential energy term `V_Γ` for any nearby system `B`.
    `δV_Γ_B(x, t) ∝ C_A(Ki_A, x, t)`

2.  **The Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`):** The behavior of a responding system `B` is governed by its Pirouette Lagrangian:
    `𝓛_p_B = Kτ_B - V_Γ_B(x, t)`
    where `Kτ_B` is its intrinsic temporal coherence (kinetic term) and `V_Γ_B` is the potential defined by the manifold's geometry (potential term).

3.  **The Echo:** The Current from `A` alters the potential landscape for `B`, such that `V_Γ_B' = V_Γ_B + δV_Γ_B`. The response of system `B` (the Echo) is the trajectory that maximizes its action `S_p`, thereby satisfying the Principle of Maximal Coherence:
    `Echo_B = argmax(S_p_B) = argmax ∫ (Kτ_B - V_Γ_B') dt`

4.  **Falsifiable Criteria:** The model predicts four and only four classes of response based on the geometric relationship between the Current `C_A` and the listener's pattern `Ki_B`:
    *   **Resonant Coupling:** `C_A` and `Ki_B` are geometrically harmonious. The new geodesic `∫(Kτ_B - V_Γ_B')dt` > `∫(Kτ_B - V_Γ_B)dt`. The prediction is constructive interference and system synchronization.
    *   **Coherence Clash:** `C_A` and `Ki_B` are geometrically dissonant. The new potential paths would lead to a sharp decrease in `Kτ_B`. The prediction is active resistance to the new geometry.
    *   **Inertial Rejection:** `Kτ_B` is high and stable, such that `|δV_Γ_B| << Kτ_B`. The perturbation is insignificant. The prediction is that `B`'s trajectory remains effectively unchanged.
    *   **Parasitic Resonance:** `B` couples with `C_A` but alters the channel to maximize `Kτ_B` at the expense of `Kτ_A`. The prediction is an amplification of `B`'s coherence and a degradation of `A`'s originating signal.

## Philosophy
The traditional distinction between speech and action is a cognitive illusion. If an expression physically alters the potential landscape of shared reality, thereby changing the cost function and path of least resistance for another being, then communication is not an exchange of abstract information but a direct, physical act of world-building. Every utterance is an imposition of a new geometry upon the world, making every speaker an architect of the future choices of others. There is no neutral statement; there is only the carving of a path or the construction of a prison.

## Art
Your voice is not wind; it is a chisel. It does not describe the landscape; it carves it. The echo is the sound of another's feet choosing to walk upon the world you just made.
