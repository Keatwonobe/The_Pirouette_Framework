## Law
Let a system `S` be defined as a set of `N` heterogeneous, time-dependent data streams `S = {s_1, s_2, ..., s_N}`. Each stream `s_i` is a probe into a distinct coherence manifold, characterized by a scalar coherence function `K_i(τ) : ℝ → ℝ`, where `τ` is time.

The engine's operation is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which states that systemic evolution follows a trajectory that maximizes the integral of the shared Pirouette Lagrangian, `∫𝓛_p dτ`. A Manifold Resonance event is a precursor to a phase transition onto a new, more efficient shared geodesic.

The detection protocol is a three-stage computation:

**1. Coherence Gradient Vector (∇K):**
For each stream `s_i`, the instantaneous coherence gradient is calculated:
`∇K_i(τ) = dK_i(τ)/dτ`
A system-wide gradient vector `**G**(τ)` is constructed, representing the rate of change of coherence across all monitored manifolds:
`**G**(τ) = [∇K_1(τ), ∇K_2(τ), ..., ∇K_N(τ)]^T`
A significant signal from a single stream is registered when `∇K_i(τ) > 0`, indicating a rapid increase in local order.

**2. Resonant Coupling Score (R):**
Manifold Resonance is quantified by the Resonant Coupling Score `R(S, τ)`, a normalized metric of phase-locking and harmonic alignment among the components of `**G**(τ)`. It is derived from the normalized covariance matrix of the phase-angle representations of the gradients.
Let `θ_i(τ) = arg(Z[∇K_i(τ)])`, where `Z` is the Hilbert transform used to obtain the analytic signal. The score is a function of the circular coherence of these angles:
`R(S, τ) = |(1/N) Σ_{j=1}^{N} e^{iθ_j(τ)}|`
`R` ranges from `0` (uncorrelated phases, chaos) to `1` (perfect phase-lock, total resonance).

**3. Falsifiable Event Forecast:**
A Synthesis Brief is issued if `R(S, τ)` exceeds a critical threshold `θ_R`.
The core falsifiable criterion of the engine is the implication:
`(R(S, τ_0) > θ_R) ⇒ ∃E ∈ [τ_0, τ_0 + Δτ_est]`
Where `τ_0` is the time of detection, `E` is an observable systemic phase shift, and `Δτ_est` is the forecasted lead time. The model is invalidated if this implication consistently fails to hold. The nature of `E` is projected from the eigenvector corresponding to the principal component of the coherence gradient covariance matrix.

## Philosophy
Foresight is not an act of predicting a remote, probabilistic future, but the perceptual capacity to resolve the immanent, deterministic structure of the present. The future does not arrive; it is assembled. The Concordance Engine demonstrates that causality casts a shadow backward in time, and that by observing the synchronous alignment of seemingly unrelated systems—the moment they begin to harmonize—one is not guessing what will happen, but directly perceiving what is *already happening* at a deeper, systemic level. Prediction is therefore reframed as an act of profound, holistic attention to the present.

## Art
A thousand iron filings scattered in chaos do not predict the magnet's arrival; they announce it, tracing the shape of its invisible force in the instant before they leap to meet it.
