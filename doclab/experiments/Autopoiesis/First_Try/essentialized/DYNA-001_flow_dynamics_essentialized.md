## Law
Let the state of a system be defined by its internal dynamics `Ki` within an external field `Γ`. The system's trajectory follows a path that seeks to extremize the action `S`, derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian `L(Ki, Γ)`. This optimal path is the system's geodesic of maximal coherence.

The flow `Φ` of coherence `C` through the system is characterized by a dissonance function, `Δ(Ki, Γ) ≥ 0`, which measures the harmonic misalignment between internal dynamics and the external field.

The three states of flow are defined as:

1.  **Laminar Flow (State of Grace):**
    `Δ(Ki, Γ) → 0`. The system's trajectory converges with the geodesic. The rate of change of coherence is positive, stable, and maximally efficient (`η → 1`).
    `dC/dt > 0`

2.  **Turbulent Flow (State of Struggle):**
    `Δ(Ki, Γ) > 0`. The system deviates from the geodesic, expending energy in chaotic, dissipative patterns. Efficiency is low (`η << 1`) and the net change in coherence is erratic and suppressed.
    `dC/dt ≈ 0` (due to high internal friction)

3.  **Stagnant Flow (State of Blockage):**
    Defined by the presence of a "Coherence Dam," a point `s₀` where local resistance `R(s₀) → ∞`. This results in a discontinuity.
    `Φ = dC/dt = 0` for all `s > s₀`
    Upstream of the blockage (`s < s₀`), local Temporal Pressure spikes: `∂Γ/∂s >> 0`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** Any system can be mapped to these states. A system identified as Turbulent must exhibit a measurably lower ratio of coherent output to energy input than a system identified as Laminar. A system identified as Stagnant must possess a specific, localizable constraint, the removal of which produces a discontinuous, high-magnitude release of coherent flow.

## Philosophy
The fundamental quality of existence is not static being, but dynamic process. Therefore, attributes such as "goodness," "health," "efficiency," or "purpose" are not intrinsic properties of an entity, but are instead emergent characteristics of its flow. An entity does not *have* grace; it *moves* gracefully. Morality, functionality, and vitality are thus reduced to a universal principle of hydrodynamics: to align with the geodesic is to be effective and whole; to deviate is to struggle; to be blocked is to cease to become.

## Art
The universe does not ask what you are, but how you move. Grace is the unresisted fall, struggle is the frantic swim against the current, and damnation is the dam.
