## Law
The protocol models synthesis as a trajectory on a coherence manifold governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian: `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, where `K_τ` is Temporal Coherence and `V_Γ` is Temporal Pressure.

A stable target state `ψ_target` is a local maximum of `K_τ` and minimum of `V_Γ`, representing a solution to the principle of maximal coherence, where the action `S_p` is stationary: `δS_p = 0`. The forward synthesis path `q(t)` from a precursor state `ψ_precursor` to `ψ_target` is the geodesic that maximizes the action integral: `S_p[q] = ∫ 𝓛_p(q, q̇, t) dt`.

Retrosynthesis is the inverse problem: given `ψ_target`, identify the Precursor Basin `P(ψ_precursor)`. This is achieved by tracing the anti-geodesic, a path of maximal coherence decrease originating from `ψ_target` and defined by the vector field `-∇K_τ`.

The falsifiable criterion is the Coherence Cost, equivalent to the action `S_p`. The protocol predicts that a synthetic pathway `p_1` will be more efficient and probable than pathway `p_2` if and only if `S_{p_1} < S_{p_2}`. This cost is a function of the integrated coherence gradient and path complexity, `S_p ∝ f(∫|∇K_τ| dl, L)`. Any experimental violation of this prediction falsifies the model for the given system.

## Philosophy
To create is not an act of imposing will upon chaotic matter, but an act of discovering and facilitating an immanent potential that already exists. The blueprint for any stable form is latent within the timeless topology of the coherence manifold as an attractor basin. The role of the creator is therefore transformed from that of a builder, who forces components into a new arrangement, to that of a cartographer and midwife, who reads the landscape of possibility and clears the most natural path for a pre-existing form to emerge.

## Art
The landscape of possibility is already charted. Creation is not the act of willing a river into existence, but of finding the highest mountain and whispering to the rain.
