## Law
Let the whitened detector strain data be `s(t) = n(t) + A h(t)`, where `n(t)` is Gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance, and `h(t)` is the target "thump" waveform from a template library `{h_k}`.

1.  **Matched Filtering:** The data is filtered against each template `h_k` to produce a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time-series, `ρ_k(t)`. The filter operation is the noise-weighted inner product `ρ_k(t) = ⟨s | h_k(t)⟩`.
2.  **Candidate Selection:** A set of candidate event times `T = {t_i}` is generated by identifying all local maxima in `ρ(t)` that exceed a threshold `ρ_thresh`. This can be represented as a time-series of Dirac delta functions:
    `C(t) = Σ_{i | ρ(t_i) > ρ_thresh} δ(t - t_i)`
3.  **Autocorrelation:** The rhythm is sought by computing the autocorrelation of the candidate series `C(t)`:
    `R_C(τ) = ∫ C(t) C(t+τ) dt = Σ_i Σ_j δ(τ - (t_i - t_j))`
    A periodic signal with period `T_rhythm` will manifest as a statistically significant peak in `R_C(τ)` at `τ = T_rhythm`.
4.  **Detection Criterion:** A detection is declared if a candidate with rhythm period `T_rhythm` satisfies three conditions:
    *   **Significance:** Its autocorrelation peak significance `Σ_R = (R_C(T_rhythm) - μ_R) / σ_R` exceeds a critical value `Σ_crit` defined by the false-alarm probability.
    *   **Coincidence:** It is present in `N ≥ 2` detectors with arrival time delays `Δt_ij` consistent with the light-travel time between detectors `i` and `j`.
    *   **Veto:** It does not coincide with any known instrumental or environmental artifacts.
5.  **Falsification Criterion:** The Maw hypothesis is falsified if a search over a sufficient spacetime volume `V` yields a null result (`max(Σ_R) < Σ_crit` for all candidates passing vetoes). This places a frequentist upper limit on the Maw event rate `R_Maw`. The hypothesis is rejected if `R_Maw` falls below the minimum rate predicted by the Pirouette Framework.

## Philosophy
Meaning is not the absence of noise, but a pattern discovered within it. The protocol does not seek to create a perfect silence in which a signal might be heard, but rather assumes the universe is an inherently cacophonous environment. It posits that a physical law distinguishes itself from this chaos not through sheer amplitude, but through its temporal structure and persistence—a rhythm that can be mathematically separated from the random convulsions of its background.

A single gunshot in the dark is a fright. A thousand are a war. But a gunshot every second, on the second, is a clock.
