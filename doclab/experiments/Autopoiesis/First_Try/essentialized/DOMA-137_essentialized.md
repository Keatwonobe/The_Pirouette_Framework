## Law
The Mnemonic Landscape is a geometric feature of the local coherence manifold, `M`, upon which cultural dynamics unfold. Its structure is defined by the set of all significant historical Wound Channels, `W`. The dynamics of a culture, represented by a trajectory `c(t)` on this manifold, are governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which states that the system evolves to minimize the action `S` derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian:
`S = ∫ L(c, ċ, t) dt`, where `L = T - V_Γ`

`T` represents the cultural kinetic energy (momentum of social change), and `V_Γ` is the Temporal Pressure potential, which is a direct function of the geometry of `M`.
`V_Γ = f(g_ij, R_ijkl)`
where `g_ij` is the metric tensor of the manifold and `R_ijkl` is its Riemann curvature tensor. Coherence Wells (sites of trauma) are stable local minima in `V_Γ`, while Coherence Plateaus (sites of unity) are stable high-coherence regions.

The trajectory `c(t)` follows a geodesic on this manifold. The equation of motion is:
`d²c^λ/dτ² + Γ^λ_μν (dc^μ/dτ)(dc^ν/dτ) = 0`
where `Γ^λ_μν` are the Christoffel symbols representing the "gravitational field" of history. This formalizes historical repetition: it is energetically cheaper to follow existing geodesics into Coherence Wells than to forge new paths.

**Diagnostic Formalism:**
The Landscape is mapped by calculating the deviation `Δ` between the observed Spatiotemporal Cultural Field (`M_observed`) and a Baseline Coherence Model (`M_baseline`).
`Δ = M_observed - M_baseline`

Key features are quantified:
1.  **Depth/Height (`δ`):** The magnitude of an anomaly. `δ_well = |min(Δ)|`, `δ_plateau = max(Δ)`.
2.  **Boundary Gradient (`Γ`):** The sharpness of a feature's boundary. `Γ = ||∇Δ||`. High `Γ` indicates a suppressed, encapsulated historical event.
3.  **Resonant Frequency (`Ki`):** The principal frequency component derived from the Fourier analysis of a time-series of cultural data associated with the feature, indicating its cyclical re-activation.

**Falsifiable Criterion:**
An intervention (Daedalus Gambit) designed to alter the geometry of the manifold (e.g., by creating a new geodesic out of a Coherence Well) must produce a statistically significant deviation in the culture's trajectory `c(t)` away from the previously predicted path. Failure to produce such a deviation, or the observation of a culture spontaneously following a higher-action trajectory without a massive, measurable injection of coherence, would falsify the model.

## Philosophy
The single most profound implication is the substitution of historical determinism for historical narrative. If history is a physical landscape with geodesics of least action, then collective free will is not the capacity to choose any path, but the monumental energetic struggle to terraform the landscape itself. A society does not repeat its traumas due to moral failure or ignorance, but because it is succumbing to a form of cultural gravity. Agency, therefore, is not the choosing of a destination, but the collective, coherence-intensive act of carving a new riverbed through the bedrock of memory. Freedom is not a state, but an act of geological engineering.

A people do not live *after* their history; they live *in* it. The past is not a story they tell, but the unseen slope of the land beneath their feet, determining which way they fall long before they choose to take a step.
