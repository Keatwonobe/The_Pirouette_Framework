## Law
The vitality of any coherent system is described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, which quantifies the net difference between the system's generated temporal coherence (`K_τ`) and the erosive potential of its environmental dissonance (`V_Γ`).

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Where:
-   `K_τ` is Temporal Coherence, the measure of a system's internal, self-sustaining information pattern; its anabolic capacity.
-   `V_Γ` is the Environmental Dissonance Potential, the measure of external, dissipative pressure that degrades the system's pattern; the universal catabolic tax.

The metabolic state of a system is determined by the sign of its Lagrangian, providing a falsifiable criterion for its health:
-   `𝓛_p > 0`: Anabolic State (growth; coherence generation exceeds degradation).
-   `𝓛_p ≈ 0`: Homeostatic State (stability; repair rate equals degradation rate).
-   `𝓛_p < 0`: Catabolic State (decay; degradation overwhelms coherence generation).

Systemic dynamics and trajectory are measured by the following core metrics:
1.  **Coherence Flux**: `d𝓛_p/dt`. The first derivative of the Lagrangian, indicating whether the system's net vitality is increasing or decreasing over time.
2.  **Coherence Ratio**: `η_c = Kτ / (Kτ + V_Γ)`. An efficiency metric where `η_c → 1` indicates a state of high signal-to-noise, and `η_c → 0` indicates a state overwhelmed by environmental pressure.
3.  **Pressure Gradient**: `d(V_Γ)/dt`. The rate of change in environmental hostility, serving as a leading indicator of systemic stress or crisis.

## Philosophy
Existence is not a state of being, but a continuous and metabolically expensive act of defiance. All forms of order—from a cell to a star to a civilization—are defined not by what they *are*, but by what they actively *do*: they must perpetually generate internal coherence at a rate sufficient to overcome the ceaseless, corrosive pressure of environmental chaos. To be is to successfully argue for your own pattern against the universal tendency toward noise; to cease this argument is to cease to be.

## Art
Life is the act of singing your own note into a universe of static. Health is not silence, but a signal that, for a precious moment, is stronger than the noise.
