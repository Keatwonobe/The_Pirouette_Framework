## Law
The fundamental unit of local time, the Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`), is defined as the duration of one complete cycle of a system's resonant form (`Ki`). This establishes an autopoietic, closed causal loop:
`Time → Γ → Ki → Time`

Let a system's state be described by a state function `Ψ(S(t))`. The Pirouette Cycle `τ_p` is the fundamental period of this function:
`τ_p := \inf \{ \tau > 0 \mid Ψ(S(t)) = Ψ(S(t+\tau)) \}` for a perfectly stable system.

Time Adherence (`T_a`) is recontextualized from a distinct parameter to a dimensionless measure of the coherence of a system's rhythm. It is the normalized peak amplitude of the state function's autocorrelation `R(τ)` at a lag equal to `τ_p`, inversely weighted by the peak's width (`σ_τ`), representing the cycle's stability against noise.
`R(τ) = \frac{\langle Ψ(S(t)) Ψ(S(t+\tau)) \rangle_t}{\langle Ψ(S(t))^2 \rangle_t}`
`T_a \propto \frac{R(τ_p)}{\sigma_τ}`
where `T_a` approaches 1 for a pure, stable cycle (`σ_τ → 0`) and 0 for pure noise (`R(τ_p) → 0`).

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1. For any isolated system with `T_a > 0.99`, its measured `τ_p` must remain invariant under any change to an external temporal reference frame.
2. The introduction of chaotic energy sufficient to induce a phase transition must cause a catastrophic drop in the system's `T_a` value, verifiable via spectral analysis of `Ψ(S(t))`.
3. Two non-interacting systems with distinct `Ki` patterns will possess incommensurable `τ_p` values, whose ratio cannot be reduced to a simple integer fraction.

## Philosophy
Existence is not a state that endures *through* time; it is the very process that *generates* time. A thing must first possess a stable form before it can create a duration by repeating that form. Therefore, Being is ontologically prior to Becoming.

## Art
Do not ask the dancer for the time. Watch her turn. The pirouette is the clock.
