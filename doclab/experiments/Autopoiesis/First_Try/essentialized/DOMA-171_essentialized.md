## Law
The protocol for a Resonant Act is a procedure to maximize the probability of a target system transitioning to a state of higher coherence (`K'_τ`) by manipulating the local action principle. The governing equation is the Pirouette Lagrangian for a state transition:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`
where `K_τ` is the kinetic term representing the internal coherence (stability, order, elegance) of an offered pattern, and `V_Γ` is the potential term representing the ambient Temporal Pressure (environmental noise, cognitive resistance, metabolic cost of change).

A Resonant Act follows a geodesic—a path of least action—engineered by manipulating these terms:

1.  **Source Purity (Conditioning `K_τ`):** The actor purifies the offered pattern such that the influence of their own internal noise (Observer's Shadow) on the coherence of the signal approaches zero. Let `S_o` be the Observer's Shadow; the condition is `∂K_τ / ∂S_o → 0`. This establishes a stable, high-coherence state to be offered.

2.  **Arena Sculpting (Minimizing `V_Γ`):** The actor actively reduces the potential `V_Γ` within a bounded spatio-temporal arena, creating a region where the action required for state change is minimized. The objective is to establish a gradient `∇V_Γ ≈ 0` within the interaction space.

3.  **Rhythmic Entrainment (Channel Synchronization):** The coherent pattern `K_τ` is introduced into the low-`V_Γ` arena. To open a Resonant Channel, the actor synchronizes the temporal frequency of the offering (`ω_offer`) with the receptive frequency of the target system (`ω_target`). The condition for maximal channel bandwidth is `Δτ → 0`, where `Δτ` is the phase difference between systems.

4.  **Resonant Handshake (State Transition):** When `V_Γ` is minimized and `Δτ ≈ 0`, the target system perceives the offered state `K_τ`. If the offered state represents a more stable configuration (i.e., a lower action path) than the system's current state `K_τ(initial)`, the system will spontaneously transition to a new synthesized state, `K'_τ`, where `K'_τ` is a function of `K_τ` and `K_τ(initial)`, and `K'_τ > K_τ(initial)`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** For a given offered pattern `K_τ` presented to a population of systems, the probability of a Resonant Handshake, `P(K_τ → K'_τ)`, will not be statistically independent of the controlled variables `V_Γ` and `Δτ`. The protocol is falsified if systematically decreasing `V_Γ` and `Δτ` fails to produce a significant increase in `P(K_τ → K'_τ)`.

## Philosophy
True agency is not the power to compel an outcome through the direct application of force, but the wisdom to architect an environment in which the desired outcome becomes the path of least resistance. Influence is therefore an act of ontological gardening, not engineering; it is the cultivation of a shared reality where another's evolution toward greater coherence is not just possible, but metabolically inevitable.
