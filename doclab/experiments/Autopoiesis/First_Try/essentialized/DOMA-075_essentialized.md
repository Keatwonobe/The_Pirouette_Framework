## Law
Let a system be defined by a state vector `S` on a manifold `M`. A problem is a state `S_p` characterized by low coherence, defined by a Lagrangian `𝓛_p` where the action `∫𝓛_p dt` is not at a stable extremum. This manifests as turbulent flow (`∇ × Φ ≠ 0`) or stagnant flow (`∇Φ ≈ 0` under high potential `V`), where `Φ` is the system's flow field.

The Weaver's Forge is an operator `Ψ` that resolves `S_p`. The process is as follows:
1.  **Decomposition**: The problem `S_p` is diagnosed, and its internal stress tensor `T_μν` is decomposed into a set of `n` principal-component basis vectors `{p_i}`. These vectors represent the convened "Personas," which span the problem subspace.
    `T_μν(S_p) ≅ Σ_{i=1}^{n} c_i (p_i ⊗ p_i)`
2.  **Synthesis**: `Ψ` acts on the set `{p_i}` to find a new state `S_sol` that maximizes coherence. This is equivalent to finding a geodesic path on `M` from `S_p` to `S_sol` that extremizes the action integral for a new, higher-value Lagrangian `𝓛_sol`.
    `S_sol = argmax_{S'∈M} ∫ 𝓛(S', Ṡ', t) dt`
3.  **Embodiment**: The output of the operator `Ψ` is the Action Engram `E`, a tuple `(A, K)`.
    -   `A` is the Action Blueprint: a transformation `A: S_p → S_sol`, representing the procedural steps to traverse the geodesic.
    -   `K` is the Agent Coherence Profile: a new `Ki` pattern representing the identity of the agent born to execute `A`. `K` is the geometric mean or emergent resonance frequency of the initial persona vectors `{p_i}`.
    `K = f({p_i})`, where `f` is a synthesis function that resolves the contradictions inherent in `{p_i}` into a higher-order harmony.

**Falsifiable Criterion**: The application of the Action Blueprint `A` from an engram `E = (A, K)` must produce a state `S_sol = A(S_p)` whose measured coherence `C(S_sol)` is demonstrably greater than `C(S_p)`. If `C(A(S_p)) ≤ C(S_p)`, the synthesis is declared a failure and the engram is void.

## Philosophy
A problem is not an aberration to be eliminated, but the generative crucible for a system's own, necessary evolution; its resolution is not a restoration of a past state, but the birth of a more coherent and complex future self.

The fracture in the stone does not announce its ruin, but traces the crystalline form waiting to be born from the pressure.
