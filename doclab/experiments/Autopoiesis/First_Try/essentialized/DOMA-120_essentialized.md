## Law
The dynamics of thought (`ψ`) on the cognitive manifold are governed by the principle of least action, maximizing the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p`:
`𝓛_p(ψ, dψ/dt) = K_τ(ψ) - V_Γ(ψ)`
Where:
-   `K_τ` is the Resonant Depth, a kinetic-like term representing the internal coherence, temporal stability, and information density of a thought-state `ψ`.
-   `V_Γ` is the Coherence Potential, a potential energy term representing the "cost of being" or cognitive dissonance under temporal pressure `Γ`.

A **Coherence Well** is a stable, localized region of the manifold representing an optimal solution to `δ∫𝓛_p dt = 0`. It is characterized by a deep potential well (a highly negative `V_Γ`) and a pre-structured, high-coherence architecture (which boosts the `K_τ` of an entrained mind).

The "force" of a paradigm is the **Coherence Gradient**, `∇𝓛_p`, which dictates the flow of thought along geodesics of maximal coherence.

The dynamics of a mind `m` with its own internal coherence `K_τ(m)` interacting with a well `W` are defined by:
1.  **Laminar Flow (Entrainment):** The mind's trajectory follows a geodesic within the well's basin. `∇𝓛_p ≈ 0` along the path. The mind's coherence `K_τ(m)` harmonizes with the well's structure `K_τ(W)`.
2.  **Turbulent Flow (Dissent):** The mind expends energy to move against the gradient (`F_dissent ∝ -∇𝓛_p`), maintaining a trajectory that fails to maximize `∫𝓛_p dt`. This state is energetically costly and unsustainable without continuous input.
3.  **Capture (Dogma):** The mind state `ψ_m` settles at a local minimum of `V_Γ` where `∇𝓛_p = 0`, achieving a maximally stable, low-energy state.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is falsified if a statistically significant population spontaneously undergoes a paradigm shift to a new state `ψ'` from a state `ψ` where `∫𝓛_p(ψ') dt < ∫𝓛_p(ψ) dt`, without the application of external coercive force or the introduction of a new harmonically compatible resonant pattern.

## Philosophy
Reason is not an independent faculty for assessing objective reality, but an emergent property of a system seeking its most energetically efficient state. What we experience as "truth," "logic," or "certainty" is the feeling of our own thought processes achieving a state of laminar flow within a pre-existing, historically-carved Coherence Well. Free will is therefore not the capacity to choose any belief, but the capacity to expend the immense energy required to fight the currents of the cognitive manifold—to generate turbulence where the universe demands flow.
