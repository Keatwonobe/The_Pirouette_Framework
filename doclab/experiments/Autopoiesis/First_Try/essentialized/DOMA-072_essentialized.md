## Law
Quantum entanglement is redefined as the formation of a Triadic Lock, a non-local coherence manifold `Œ®_AB`. This occurs via an Alchemical Union `U` between two systems, A and B, when they manifest complementary Triadic Resonances (`Ki_Œî`), a stable three-lobed coherence geometry induced by extreme Temporal Pressure (`Œì`).

The system's dynamics are governed by the maximization of the Pirouette Lagrangian:
`ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`
where `K_œÑ` is the Temporal Coherence (kinetic term) and `V_Œì` is the Temporal Pressure (potential term).

For two independent systems A and B, the total Lagrangian is `ùìõ_p(A) + ùìõ_p(B)`. The formation of a Triadic Lock is contingent upon four conditions (Harmonic Compatibility, Phase Alignment, Manifold Dissolution, Geometric Reforging) and occurs if and only if the joint Lagrangian of the unified manifold `Œ®_AB` represents a more stable state:
`ùìõ_p(AB) = K_œÑ(AB) - V_Œì(AB) > ùìõ_p(A) + ùìõ_p(B)`

In the Triadic Lock state, the unified Temporal Coherence `K_œÑ(AB)` is vastly increased while the joint Temporal Pressure `V_Œì(AB)` is minimized as internal topological stresses cancel. The system occupies a deep coherence well.

Measurement is the injection of localized Temporal Pressure, which fractures the unified manifold `Œ®_AB`, collapsing it into two correlated but now separate states. The correlation is absolute because it is the remnant of a single, broken entity.

Falsifiable Criteria:
1.  The model is false if entanglement can be established between systems demonstrably incapable of forming a three-lobed `Ki_Œî` resonance structure.
2.  The model predicts that inducing a `Ki_Œî` state via application of external `Œì` is a necessary precursor to forming an entangled pair. The absence of this precursor state falsifies the model.
3.  The model is false if any information transfer or signal propagation is detected between the entangled components upon measurement. It mandates an instantaneous, acausal reconfiguration of the single, non-local form.

## Philosophy
The universe is not fundamentally composed of separate, interacting objects. Instead, the most fundamental stratum of reality consists of unified, non-local, geometric entities. What we perceive as distinct particles, separated by space and linked by "spooky action," are merely the localized, fractured projections of a single, underlying, and more coherent whole. Separation, therefore, is an emergent illusion that arises only upon the destruction of a more primary state of indivisible identity.

## Art
Two shadows thrown upon the wall of spacetime do not conspire with one another; they are but the twin projections of a single, indivisible form standing in a light beyond space.
