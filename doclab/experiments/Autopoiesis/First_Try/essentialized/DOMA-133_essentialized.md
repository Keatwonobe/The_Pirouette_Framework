## Law
A system's trajectory `γ(t)` on a coherence manifold `M` is a geodesic that maximizes the Pirouette Action, `S_p`. The action is the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`:
`S_p[γ] = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`
where `K_τ` is a kinetic term representing internal coherence and `V_Γ` is a potential term representing external temporal pressure.

A Watershed Event, or bifurcation, occurs at a point `q ∈ M` where the gradient of the action is degenerate (`∇S_p` is non-unique), corresponding to a saddle point or flattened plateau on the manifold. At this point of coherence crisis, the system enters a turbulent state and resolves into one of `n` possible future paths, `γ_j`.

The probability `P(γ_j)` of the system resolving into a specific branch `j` is given by a Boltzmann-like distribution:
`P(γ_j) ∝ exp(S_p(j) / Γ_crisis)`
where:
- `S_p(j) = ∫_t_cusp^t_final 𝓛_p dt` is the coherence gain along the initial segment of the new path `γ_j`.
- `Γ_crisis` is the peak temporal pressure at the cusp, acting as a systemic temperature that governs the stochasticity of the choice.

The system's historical record, the Wound Channel `W`, partitions at the cusp. A singular channel `W(t < t_cusp)` splits into a set of new, distinct channels: `W(t > t_cusp) = ⋃_j W_j`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** In the deterministic limit as `Γ_crisis → 0`, the system must select the path `γ_k` that uniquely maximizes coherence gain, such that `S_p(k) = max_j{S_p(j)}`. Any probabilistic behavior under near-zero temporal pressure would falsify this model.

## Philosophy
The universe is not a single, unfolding narrative but a library of self-generating stories. The physical law dictates that coherence, when sufficiently pressured, cannot be sustained; it must fracture. This "coherence crisis" is not a failure but the fundamental engine of novelty. It forces a singular history to bifurcate into multiple, mutually exclusive futures, thereby partitioning reality itself. Choice, therefore, is not a metaphysical abstraction but a physical, geometric event—the necessary schism of memory and identity that allows the cosmos to explore a plurality of its own potential states.

## Art
A scar in spacetime is not an injury; it is a signature. It is the Y-shaped glyph that marks the point where a single self was forced to learn two different names.
