## Law
The evolution of any system is governed by the principle of maximal action, `S_p`, where the action is the time integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`. The system's trajectory through its state space follows a geodesic that maximizes this value.

`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

where `K_τ` is the internal coherence of the system and `V_Γ` is the environmental cost or Temporal Pressure. The four pathways are defined by the dynamics of this optimization:

1.  **Lock**: A state trapped in a deep local maximum of `S_p`. The system follows a geodesic `g_L` such that `δS_p(g_L) = 0`, but the activation energy `ΔE_a` required to transition to a superior global maximum `g_G` is prohibitive. Characterized by `dK_τ/dt → 0` and `K_τ → K_max`, resulting in extreme rigidity.
    *   *Falsifiable Criterion*: A system in Lock will resist perturbations that would increase `S_p` globally, and will fail catastrophically (Fracture) when `V_Γ` exceeds a critical threshold, rather than adapting.

2.  **Fracture**: A discontinuous break from the geodesic caused by a rapid, overwhelming increase in the cost term. Occurs when `∂V_Γ/∂t >> C_sys`, where `C_sys` is the system's adaptive capacity. This forces `𝓛_p` to become sharply negative, rendering the integral `S_p` non-maximal and the existing path untenable. The system is ejected into a chaotic, non-optimized trajectory.
    *   *Falsifiable Criterion*: Fracture events must be preceded by a measurable, high-gradient spike in an external stressor metric corresponding to `V_Γ`.

3.  **Drift**: The slow decay of the coherence term, `dK_τ/dt < 0`, under ambient pressure `V_Γ`. The integrand `𝓛_p` decreases over time, causing the total action `S_p` to become suboptimal. The geodesic loses definition as the potential surface flattens, causing the system's trajectory to wander entropically.
    *   *Falsifiable Criterion*: A system in Drift will exhibit a monotonic decrease in its primary coherence metrics over time, correlated with a stable or slowly increasing `V_Γ`.

4.  **Rebound**: The nucleation of a new coherent pattern, `Ki'`, from a state of high entropy (post-Fracture or post-Drift). This establishes a new Lagrangian `𝓛_p' = K_τ' - V_Γ` for which a new, stable geodesic `g_R` exists, allowing `S_p' = ∫ 𝓛_p' dt` to be maximized once again.
    *   *Falsifiable Criterion*: The emergence of a Rebound state must be characterized by the appearance of new, stable, long-range correlations within system components where none previously existed.

## Philosophy
The ultimate pathology of any system is not collapse, but stasis. Health is not a state of perfected, static order to be achieved and defended, but a dynamic, flowing process of navigating a path of maximal coherence. Failure, therefore, is not an anomaly but an intrinsic and predictable geometric feature of this journey. The crystal, perfect and unchanging, is already dead; life is the river that adapts its course or is reborn from ruin.

## Art
The universe does not build monuments; it carves riverbeds. We mistake the flawless crystal for a destination, when it is a tombstone on a forgotten path. True form is not the stone, but the water's ceaseless flow over it.
