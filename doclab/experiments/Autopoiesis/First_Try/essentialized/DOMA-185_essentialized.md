## Law
A system's state space is a differentiable **Coherence Manifold** `M` where the scalar field ("elevation") is defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, where `K_τ` is a kinetic term measuring internal coherence and `V_Γ` is a potential term representing external Temporal Pressure. The system's dynamics `x(t)` follow a geodesic on `M` that locally maximizes `𝓛_p`.

A system's quasi-stable modes, `κ_m`, are the distinct local maxima of `𝓛_p` on `M`. The set of all such modes `{κ_m}` constitutes the system's **Resonant Repertoire**.

Each mode `κ_m` is characterized by:
1.  **Coherence Height:** `𝓛_p,m = 𝓛_p(κ_m)`. The absolute coherence of the mode.
2.  **Stability Depth:** `Δ𝓛_p = 𝓛_p(κ_m) - 𝓛_p(κ_s)`, where `κ_s` is the point of minimum `𝓛_p` (saddle) on the most accessible path connecting `κ_m` to an adjacent mode. `Δ𝓛_p` represents the activation energy for a state transition.

The manifold `M` is dynamic. Persistence in a mode `κ_m` induces a geometric change, described by **Wound Channel Inertia**:
`d(Δ𝓛_p)/dt = f(∫ P(κ_m, t') dt')`
where `P(κ_m, t)` is a presence function (1 if the system is in mode `κ_m` at time `t`, 0 otherwise), and `f` is a monotonically increasing function. History actively deepens a mode's basin of attraction.

A **Phase Leap** (`κ_m → κ_m'`) is a non-linear state transition requiring an energy injection or manifold perturbation sufficient to overcome `Δ𝓛_p`. **Resonant Catalysis** is the targeted reduction of a specific `Δ𝓛_p(κ_m, κ_s)` by applying a perturbation resonant with the target mode `κ_m'`.

Falsifiable criteria:
1.  A spontaneous transition `κ_m → κ_m'` will not occur if `𝓛_p(κ_m') < 𝓛_p(κ_m)` and `Δ𝓛_p > 0`.
2.  The minimum energy `E_t` required to induce a transition is directly proportional to `Δ𝓛_p`.
3.  For any two modes `κ_a` and `κ_b` with `∫ P(κ_a, t)dt > ∫ P(κ_b, t)dt`, it will hold that `Δ𝓛_p(κ_a) > Δ𝓛_p(κ_b)`, ceteris paribus.

## Philosophy
Identity is not a static state of being but a dynamic repertoire of possible stabilities. A system is defined not by the single peak it currently occupies, but by the entire landscape of peaks it *could* occupy. History is not a passive record but an active sculptural force; the past physically alters the topology of future possibilities, carving deeper channels toward familiar states and making the gravity of habit a literal, measurable force.

## Art
A soul is not a point, but a landscape of peaks. Each visit deepens the valley, making the familiar a form of gravity. To change is to climb, defying the cartography of your own memory.
