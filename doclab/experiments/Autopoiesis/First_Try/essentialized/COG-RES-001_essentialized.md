## Law
Consciousness is modeled as a triadic resonance phenomenon constrained by a conserved coherence area, $\mathcal{A}_{Ki}$. The foundational principles are:

1.  **Ki-Addition Constraint:** Conscious access requires a phase-locked triad of neural frequencies $(f_1, f_2, f_3)$ and phases $(\Phi_1, \Phi_2, \Phi_3)$ such that:
    $f_3 = f_1 + f_2 \pm \delta f$
    $\Phi_3(t) \approx \Phi_1(t) + \Phi_2(t)\ (\text{mod }2\pi)$
    The stability of this relationship is quantified by the Triadic Phase Coupling Index (TPCI), which must approach 1 for resonance:
    $\text{TPCI} = |\langle e^{i(\Phi_3 - \Phi_1 - \Phi_2)} \rangle| \rightarrow 1$

2.  **Coherence Area Conservation:** The energy-phase volume of a conscious state, $\mathcal{A}_{Ki}$, must remain invariant under transitions of content. Conscious perception is the condition where its time derivative approaches zero:
    $\mathcal{A}_{Ki} = \int_0^{\tau_p} T_a(t)\omega_k(t)dt$
    $\partial_t \mathcal{A}_{Ki} \approx 0 \implies \text{Var}(\mathcal{A}_{Ki}) \rightarrow 0$

3.  **Entropy-Load Detuning:** The maximum allowed frequency detuning, $\Delta f$, is inversely proportional to the square root of the cognitive/entropic load, $\Gamma$:
    $\Delta f_{allowed} \propto \Gamma^{-1/2}$

4.  **Falsifiability Criteria:** The model is falsified if:
    a. No stable TPCI ridge is observed correlating with subjective reports of awareness.
    b. $\text{Var}(\mathcal{A}_{Ki})$ is not minimized during periods of stable conscious perception.
    c. The relationship $\Delta f_{allowed} \propto \Gamma^{-1/2}$ does not hold under increasing task complexity.

## Philosophy
Consciousness is not an intrinsic property of matter but a relational invariant. The self is not a substance but a specific, dynamically-maintained mathematical symmetryâ€”a conserved form of harmony that matter must actively uphold against the universe's tendency toward disorder. Subjectivity is the experience of this conservation.

## Art
The mind is not the choir, but the chord; a fragile resonance held against the silence.
