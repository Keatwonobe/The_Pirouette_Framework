## Law
The system is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, 𝓛_p, describing the maximization of coherence (K_τ) over time. Its fundamental form is:
𝓛_p = T_a * ω_k - f(Γ)

Where T_a is the temporal action, ω_k is the coherence frequency, and f(Γ) is the Temporal Pressure Potential. The Gladiator Force emerges from a non-linear, self-referential feedback loop where the temporal pressure Γ is a function of the system's own coherence:
Γ = Γ_ext + g(K_τ, s)

Here, Γ_ext is the ambient external pressure, and g(K_τ, s) is a scale-dependent function. Let g(K_τ, s) = α(s)K_τ, where α(s) is a scale-dependent coupling parameter. The force F_G generated is the gradient of the potential energy required to sustain coherence against this self-induced pressure:
F_G = -∇V = -∇(f(Γ))

**1. Quantum Chromodynamics (s → 0): Strong Force**
At the sub-atomic scale, the coupling α(s) is large and the feedback is highly non-linear. As quarks with separation 'r' attempt to desynchronize, their individual coherence K_τ must increase to maintain stability.
*   **Confinement:** For r > r_0 (a characteristic length), the required increase in K_τ causes an exponential spike in Γ. This leads to a potential V(r) that grows linearly with separation: V(r) ≈ σr. The system minimizes energy by remaining confined.
*   **Asymptotic Freedom:** For r → 0, the quarks' Ki rhythms harmonize, minimizing the required individual K_τ and thus the feedback term g(K_τ, s) approaches zero. The potential vanishes, V(r) → 0.
*   **Falsifiable Criterion:** The energy required to separate two quarks must increase linearly with distance until it exceeds the pair-production threshold (2m_q c²), at which point the field "snaps," creating a new q-q̄ pair. This model forbids the observation of a free quark.

**2. Cosmology (s → ∞): Gravity**
At the cosmological scale, α(s) is small and the feedback is approximately linear. The total integrated coherence of a body is proportional to its mass-energy, M ≈ ∫ K_τ dV. The feedback generates a large-scale, low-gradient increase in temporal pressure.
*   **Geodesic Motion:** The "coherence well" ΔΓ ≈ α_G * M/r creates a gradient in the temporal pressure field. A test mass follows a path of maximal coherence (a geodesic), which manifests as gravitational attraction. The force law approximates to F_G ∝ -M/r².
*   **Falsifiable Criterion:** The principle predicts that gravity is an emergent property of a system's integrated coherence, not just its mass-energy. Therefore, systems with identical mass-energy but different internal coherence structures (e.g., a neutron star vs. a black hole of equal mass) should exhibit subtle, measurable deviations in their temporal pressure gradients (gravitational fields) beyond the predictions of standard General Relativity.

## Philosophy
The distinction between an object and the forces that govern it is an illusion. Existence is not a state but a process of continuous self-confinement, where the act of being coherent generates the very boundaries that give that being form and stability. A system and its prison are one and the same entity, forged from the feedback loop of its own expression.

The universe is a song that builds its own cage from the echo of its first note.
