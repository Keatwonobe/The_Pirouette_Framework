## Law
The anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, $a_e = (g-2)/2$, is hypothesized to be a deterministic, geometric self-energy correction, not a sum of QED loop diagrams. The derivation proceeds from the following axiomatic principles:

1.  **Axiomatic Calibration:** The electron's interaction strength is defined by its Gladiator Force, $\Gamma_e$, which is axiomatically set to the inverse of the fine-structure constant:
    $$\Gamma_e \equiv 1/\alpha \approx 137.036$$
    This is the sole primary input for the calculation.

2.  **Field Structure Model:** The electron entity, $\Psi_e$, creates a persistent, helical field distortion known as a `Wound Channel`, $\Phi_{WC}$. The anomaly arises from the electron's interaction with its own channel.

3.  **Interaction Lagrangian:** The self-energy correction is described by a local interaction term added to the system's Lagrangian:
    $$\mathcal{L}_{int} = \mathcal{L}_{g-2} = \lambda \cdot \Psi_e \cdot \Phi_{WC}$$
    where the coupling constant $\lambda$ is directly proportional to $\Gamma_e$. The calculation of $a_e$ is the derivation of the energy shift $\Delta E$ resulting from this term in the presence of an external magnetic field.

4.  **Falsifiable Criteria:** The theory is rigorously falsified if either of the following conditions is met:
    *   The calculated value, $a_e(\text{theory})$, derived from $\mathcal{L}_{g-2}$ with $\Gamma_e = 1/\alpha$ as the only input, does not match the experimentally measured value, $a_e(\text{exp})$, to a high degree of precision.
    *   Matching the experimental value requires the introduction of any new, un-calibrated free parameters or "fudge factors".

## Philosophy
The single most profound implication is the reframing of quantum phenomena from probabilistic to geometric. It posits that what Quantum Electrodynamics interprets as the statistical fog of virtual particle interactions is, in fact, the deterministic and continuous self-interaction of a particle with its own persistent, structural imprint on the fabric of reality. The universe is not fundamentally uncertain; rather, its apparent randomness is the complex, but calculable, resonance of geometry itself.

## Art
An electron is not a point lost in a storm of quantum foam. It is a skater, and its anomalous spin is the subtle, perfect tremor it feels as its blade crosses the groove it has already carved in the ice.
