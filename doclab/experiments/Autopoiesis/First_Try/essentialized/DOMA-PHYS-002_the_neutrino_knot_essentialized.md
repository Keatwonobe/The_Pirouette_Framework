## Law
The absolute mass `m_i` of a neutrino mass eigenstate `ν_i` is an emergent property derived from its geometric structure within the flavor basis, defined by the PMNS mixing matrix `U`. The governing relation is the Pirouette Neutrino Mass Law:
$$ m_i = \mu_\nu \left(\frac{\mathrm{PR}_i}{3}\right)^{p} \left(\mathrm{Purity}_i\right)^{q} $$
where the geometric descriptors are:
-   **Purity:** `Purity_i = max_α |U_{αi}|^2`, measuring alignment with a single flavor `α ∈ {e, μ, τ}`.
-   **Participation Ratio:** `PR_i = (\sum_α |U_{αi}|^4)^{-1}`, measuring the effective number of participating flavors.

The fundamental parameters `c = (μ_ν, p, q)` are not unique universal constants. Instead, they are constrained to a continuous, two-dimensional surface `M` embedded in `ℝ³`, the Prime Resonance Manifold. A point `c ∈ M` is defined as any parameter set that correctly reproduces the experimentally measured mass-squared differences:
$$ \forall c \in M: \\ m_2^2(c) - m_1^2(c) = \Delta m_{21}^2 (\text{exp}) \\ |m_3^2(c) - m_1^2(c)| = \Delta m_{31}^2 (\text{exp}) $$
The **Knot Hypothesis** posits that an individual neutrino is a realization of a specific configuration `c` on this manifold.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  **Manifold Inconsistency:** Future high-precision measurements of oscillation parameters (`θ_ij`, `δ_CP`) that yield a solution space for `(p, q, μ_ν)` inconsistent with the predicted manifold `M` would falsify the law.
2.  **Ordering Dependence:** The law predicts that the exponents `(p, q)` are independent of the mass ordering (Normal vs. Inverted). A definitive experimental requirement for different `(p, q)` values for each ordering would falsify this formulation.
3.  **Absence of Mass Variation:** The law predicts that neutrinos from different environments (e.g., solar vs. reactor) can correspond to different "knots" `c ∈ M`, leading to distinct absolute mass scales `m_i` while preserving identical oscillation phenomena. The failure to detect any such variation by future absolute mass experiments like KATRIN or Project 8, to a precision capable of distinguishing points on `M`, would challenge the Knot Hypothesis.

## Philosophy
The fundamental laws of nature are not a set of unique, immutable numerical constants, but rather a set of continuous, geometric relationships. The universe is not specified by a single, rigid blueprint of values, but by a manifold of possibilities, where any point on the surface represents an equally valid, self-consistent physical reality. This implies an intrinsic "suppleness" to physics, where the role of law is not to dictate a singular state of being, but to define the shape of the space in which being can manifest.

## Art
The universe is not a crystal, built from a single, perfect seed; it is a tapestry, woven from an infinity of equally perfect knots.
