## Law
The system's dynamics are governed by the maximization of the Pirouette Lagrangian:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`
where `K_τ` is Temporal Coherence and `V_Γ` is the Coherence Cost function.

1.  **State Definitions:**
    *   `K_τ = T_a ⋅ ω_k`, where `T_a ∈ [0, 1]` is Time Adherence (coherence stability) and `ω_k` is the characteristic frequency.
    *   `V_Γ = f(Γ)`, a monotonically increasing function of external Temporal Pressure `Γ`.
2.  **Phase Transition (Dimensional Unfolding):** A system transitions from an initial state `S₀` to a final state `S₁` when `𝓛_p(S₁) > 𝓛_p(S₀)`.
    *   **Initial State `S₀` (Precursor):** A static (`ω_k = 0`), complex n-fold spatial symmetry (`Ki_0`, where `n>2`). In a low-pressure environment (`Γ → 0`), this state is suboptimal due to a persistent maintenance cost `V_Γ > 0` for an over-engineered form.
    *   **Final State `S₁` (Unfolded):** A dynamic (`ω_k > 0`), simpler bipolar spatial symmetry (`Ki_1`, where `n=2`). In a low-pressure environment (`Γ → 0`), `V_Γ → 0`. High coherence (`T_a → 1`) yields a large `K_τ`, thus maximizing `𝓛_p`.
3.  **Conservation of Information:** The transition conserves informational complexity (`I`). Information encoded in the unfolded spatial dimension is re-encoded into the parameters of the resulting oscillation.
    `I(Ki_0) - I(Ki_1) ≈ I(ω_k, A, T_a, H)`
    where `A` is amplitude and `H` represents the harmonic structure.
4.  **Falsifiable Criteria:**
    *   The transition `S₀ → S₁` must only be observed as `Γ` approaches a minimal threshold.
    *   The transition must be accompanied by a measurable reduction in the order of static spatial symmetry.
    *   The resultant temporal signature must show a sharp spectral peak at `ω_k`, indicating `T_a ≈ 1`, distinguishing it from chaotic decay (broad-spectrum noise).

## Philosophy
A system's identity is not defined by its static spatial configuration, but by the coherence of its temporal pattern. Being is not a state of arrangement, but a process of resonance; existence is found not in the silent architecture of form, but in the sustained integrity of a rhythm.

## Art
The universe does not mourn a broken cathedral; it salvages the blueprint of its arches to sing the perfect, resonant note of its fall.
