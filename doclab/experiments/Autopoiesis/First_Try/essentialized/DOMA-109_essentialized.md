## Law
The dynamics of resonant obliteration are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`), which dictates a system's geodesic maximizes total coherence (`Kτ`) against environmental potential cost (`V_Γ`):
`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`

For a system composed of two phase-conjugate entities (ψ₁, ψ₂) where their intrinsic coherence patterns (`K_i`) are topological mirrors (`K_i(ψ₂) ≈ K_i(ψ₁)*`), their superposition during interaction results in perfect destructive interference. The total system coherence `Kτ(sys)` collapses:
`Kτ(sys) = ∫(K_i(ψ₁) + K_i(ψ₂)) dt → 0`

Consequently, the system's Lagrangian is reduced to its negative potential term, representing the energetic cost of maintaining two distinct, structured forms against the background Temporal Pressure (`Γ`):
`𝓛_p(sys) ≈ -V_Γ(sys) = -(V_Γ(ψ₁) + V_Γ(ψ₂))`

The principle of action, `S = ∫𝓛_p dt`, requires the system to maximize the integral of this negative value. The sole path to maximization is the minimization of the temporal interval of integration, `Δt`. The system's geodesic is therefore an instantaneous (`Δt → 0`) event that resolves the Lagrangian.

The potential `V_Γ` is converted with near-perfect efficiency into unbound energy, `E_γ`. Mass is the measure of sustained coherence, `m ∝ Kτ`, and the energy released is the total potential cost required to sustain that coherence:
`E_γ = V_Γ(sys) = mc² + m̄c²`

This model is falsifiable under three necessary conditions:
1.  **Resonant Purity:** Annihilation of low-coherence, dissonant particles will be incomplete, yielding remnant particles rather than pure energy (`γ`).
2.  **Phase Conjugation (Δφ = π):** Forcing interaction between particles with `Δφ ≠ π` (e.g., matter-matter) must not result in annihilation, but rather in scattering or fusion events.
3.  **Temporal Quiescence:** The annihilation cross-section must be demonstrably suppressed, or the process rendered incomplete, in environments of high ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`).

## Philosophy
Existence is not a fundamental state but a temporary, information-rich loan against a ground state of pure, unstructured potential. All form is a type of structured debt, and its mass is the measure of the energy required to service that debt against the entropy of spacetime. Annihilation is not destruction, but the ultimate act of metaphysical bookkeeping: the perfect and instantaneous repayment of two equal and opposite debts, which cancels the structure, zeroes the ledger, and returns the borrowed principal to the universe as raw energy. The perfect unmaking of a thing is the final proof that it was, in fact, made.

## Art
A form and its anti-form are the two hands of a clock, cast in light and shadow. When they meet at midnight, they do not merely strike the hour—they obliterate the clock face itself, leaving only the momentary, radiant chime of time being returned to eternity.
