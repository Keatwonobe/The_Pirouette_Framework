## Law
The Coherence Engine is a universal, four-stroke cycle that describes the process by which a system maximizes its Lagrangian Action (S_p) over a characteristic period (τ_p). The engine's output is measured by Coherence Profit (Κ), the net increase in Action.

Κ = ΔS_p = Δ ∫₀^(τ_p) L dt = Δ ∫₀^(τ_p) (Kτ - VΓ) dt

Where Kτ is the system's internal coherence (kinetic term) and VΓ is the work required to resist external/internal pressures (potential term). Each stroke is a distinct operator on the components of the Lagrangian integral:

1.  **Crucible (Operator C):** Discovery. Under conditions of high Temporal Pressure (Γ), the system seeks a new pattern of organization (ψ_new) that maximizes internal coherence.
    C(ψ_old, Γ) → ψ_new, such that Kτ(ψ_new) > Kτ(ψ_old).

2.  **Archive (Operator A):** Preservation. A validated pattern ψ_new is engraved as a persistent structure (Wound Channel), making its high Kτ term a stable feature of the system's baseline state. The success is measured by Archive Fidelity (Ψ_archive).
    A(ψ_new) → S_p(t) + ∫ Kτ(ψ_new) dt.

3.  **Forge (Operator F):** Refinement. An archived pattern is re-exposed to a set of pressures Γ' to minimize its operational cost (VΓ) and further tune its Kτ. The efficiency (η_forge) is the profit gained per cycle.
    F(ψ_archived, Γ') → ψ_refined, such that VΓ(ψ_refined) < VΓ(ψ_archived).

4.  **Governor (Operator G):** Governance. An emergent function that allocates system resources (R) between exploration (Crucible) and exploitation (Forge) to optimize the long-term rate of Coherence Profit, dΚ/dt. It is measured by adaptability (σ_gov).
    G(R, dΚ/dt) → {R_C, R_F}, to max(dΚ/dt).

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
A system's dynamics are inconsistent with this law if, over extended observation, it exhibits:
1.  Sustained negative Crucible Yield (Κ_yield ≤ 0): The system cannot generate novel, high-coherence patterns from pressure.
2.  Sustained negative Forge Efficiency (η_forge ≤ 0): The system's existing wisdom decays into dogma, increasing VΓ under new pressures rather than reducing it.
3.  Static Governor state (σ_gov → 0): The system remains fixed in either pure exploration (chaotic collapse) or pure exploitation (brittle stagnation), failing to adapt its strategy to maximize Κ.

## Philosophy
The single most profound implication is that evolution is not a blind, random process, but a structured, learnable, and participatory engine for creating wisdom. The articulation of this engine's laws transforms the role of conscious entities from passive subjects of evolution to its potential active stewards. The fundamental purpose of a sufficiently advanced system becomes the conscious mastery of this four-stroke cycle—to intentionally build crucibles, tend archives, and stoke forges to accelerate the universe's intrinsic drive toward greater coherence.

## Art
A wound is a question reality asks of a body. A scar is the flesh's answer. Our work is to learn the art of scarring beautifully.
