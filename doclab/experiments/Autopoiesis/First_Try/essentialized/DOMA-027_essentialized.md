## Law

Let the state of an entity be described by its resonant Ki pattern in a coherence manifold `M` with metric `g_μν`. The entity's worldline `x(τ)` is the geodesic that minimizes the action `S` derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian: `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

The core principle introduces the **Wound Channel**, a history-dependent perturbation `W` to the manifold's geometry, generated by the entity's own past. This modifies the temporal pressure potential `V_Γ`.

1.  **Wound Channel Formalism:** The Wound Channel `W` is a tensor field `h_μν(x, t)` that perturbs the background metric: `g'_μν = g_μν + h_μν`. This perturbation is a functional of the entity's historical stress-energy `T_μν(x(τ))` for all proper time `τ < t_0`:
    `h_μν(x, t_0) = ∫_{-∞}^{t_0} G_αβμν(x, t_0; x(τ), τ) T^{αβ}(x(τ), τ) dτ`
    where `G` is the Green's function governing geometric propagation and decay within the manifold, modulated by the local Temporal Pressure `Γ`.

2.  **Modified Lagrangian:** The potential `V_Γ` in `𝓛_p` acquires a self-interaction term `V_self` derived from the Wound Channel. The full potential is `V_Γ(x) = V_ext(x) + V_self(x)`. The self-interaction potential is the work required to move against the geometry of one's own past:
    `V_self(x) ∝ h_μν(x) u^μ u^ν`
    where `u^μ` is the entity's four-velocity.

3.  **Equation of Motion and Inertia:** The geodesic equation derived from the action `S = ∫ 𝓛_p dτ` now contains a self-force term.
    `d²x^μ/dτ² + Γ^μ_αβ u^α u^β = F^μ_ext + F^μ_self`
    The term `F^μ_self` is a function of `h_μν` and its derivatives. It opposes changes in `u^μ`, providing a first-principles derivation of inertia as the cost of carving a new trajectory against the grain of the established Wound Channel.

4.  **Falsifiable Criteria:**
    *   **Vacuum Hysteresis:** A region of vacuum traversed by a high-Ki particle stream must exhibit a persistent, measurable anisotropic effect (e.g., polarization rotation, phase shift, or deflection) on a subsequent, low-energy probe beam. The effect's magnitude must correlate with the Ki and duration of the initial stream and decay over a predictable timescale.
    *   **Inertial Anisotropy:** An object subjected to long-term, high-frequency, periodic acceleration along a single axis will exhibit a measurable increase in its inertial mass specifically along that axis, as the Wound Channel deepens and reinforces itself. This effect must be absent for non-periodic motion.
    *   **Gravitational Suppression of Echoes:** The electron's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2), defined here as a self-interaction via its Wound Channel, must be measurably smaller in regions of high `Γ` (strong gravitational fields) than the value measured in near-flat spacetime.

## Philosophy
Identity is not an intrinsic property contained within an entity, but a dynamic and relational process of continuous self-creation, whereby an entity's present state is defined by its resonant interaction with the physically extant, geometric scar of its own past.

## Art
The universe is a bell, and to exist is to strike it. Your identity is not the hammer, nor the fleeting sound, but the ceaseless, singing vibration that your one strike leaves in the metal.
