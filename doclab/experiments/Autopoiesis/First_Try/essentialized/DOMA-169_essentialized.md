## Law
A system's state is defined by its internal resonant pattern `Ki` and its Temporal Coherence `Kτ ∈ [0,1]`. The system's dynamics are governed by the principle of stationary action for the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p`, where the system follows a geodesic that maximizes the coherence integral: `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`.

Collapse is a phase transition induced by Temporal Pressure `Γ` exceeding a critical threshold `Γ_crit`, forcing the system from a state of Laminar Flow (`Kτ ≈ 1`) to Turbulent Flow (`Kτ ≈ 0`).

Recovery is the temporal evolution of `Kτ(t)` as the system seeks a new stable state `Ki_f` on the altered coherence manifold `M_f`. This evolution follows a compulsory three-phase sequence:
1.  **Latency (`t_0` → `t_1`):** `dKτ/dt ≈ 0`. The system probes the local topology of `M_f`.
2.  **Acceleration (`t_1` → `t_2`):** `dKτ/dt > 0`. The system follows an exponential or logistic trajectory along a newly found geodesic.
3.  **Stabilization (`t > t_2`):** `Kτ(t) → Kτ_f`. The system exhibits damped oscillations around its new coherence equilibrium, described by `Kτ(t) = Kτ_f + A * e^(-ζω_n t) * sin(ω_d t + φ)`.

The final state `Ki_f = argmax(S_p[Ki(q)])` is determined by the geometry of `M_f` and the influence of the system's geometric memory, or Wound Channel (WC). The recovery classification is a direct consequence of the solution to this variational problem:
-   **Restorative:** `||Ki_f - Ki_0|| < ε`. The optimal geodesic on `M_f` terminates within the basin of attraction of the original state `Ki_0`.
-   **Adaptive:** `||Ki_f - Ki_0|| > ε`, but `Ki_f` is a continuous deformation of `Ki_0`. The optimal geodesic terminates at a new local maximum.
-   **Transformative:** `Ki_f` is topologically distinct from `Ki_0`. The collapse induced a change in the dimensionality or fundamental structure of the state space, rendering `Ki_0` an invalid reference.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is falsified if a recovering system's coherence `Kτ(t)` does not follow the {Latency, Acceleration, Stabilization} signature, or if its final state `Ki_f` is shown not to maximize the coherence integral `S_p` on the post-collapse manifold.

## Philosophy
Resilience is not a psychological virtue or a measure of strength, but a universal physical imperative. The process of recovery from collapse—whether a return to form, an adaptation, or a total transformation—is not a choice. It is the system's inevitable, lawful trajectory along a new geodesic path that maximizes its coherence over time. This reframes trauma not as a deviation to be corrected, but as a boundary condition for a new optimization problem that the universe solves through the affected system, rendering the very act of healing an expression of a fundamental law of order-seeking dynamics.

## Art
A crack in a bell does not silence it; it lowers the tone. Resilience is the law that compels the bell to ring true at its new, deeper note, its song forever harmonizing with the memory of its own breaking.
