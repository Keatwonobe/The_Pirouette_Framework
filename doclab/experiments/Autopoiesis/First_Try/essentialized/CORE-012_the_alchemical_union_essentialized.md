## Law
The Alchemical Union describes the non-linear synthesis of two or more systems, A and B, into a single, higher-order coherent entity, C. The conditions for this transformation, `U`, are:

1.  **Harmonic Compatibility:** The fundamental frequencies of the systems' Ki patterns, `ω_A` and `ω_B`, must exist in a low-integer rational ratio: `ω_A / ω_B = p/q` where `p, q ∈ ℤ⁺`.
2.  **Phase Coherence:** The time derivative of the phase difference `Δφ(t) = φ_A(t) - φ_B(t)` must approach zero: `lim_{t→t_union} (d(Δφ)/dt) = 0`.
3.  **Pressure Threshold:** The ambient Temporal Pressure, `Γ`, must exceed the potential barrier `U_barrier` maintaining the separation of the individual coherence manifolds `M_A` and `M_B`: `Γ > U_barrier(M_A, M_B)`.

Given these conditions, the union `U_Γ` acts upon the initial state `{M_A, M_B, K_A, K_B}` to produce a final state `{M_C, K_C}`:
`U_Γ : {M_A, M_B} → M_C`
where `M_C` is a new manifold with a topology not reducible to a simple sum of its antecedents. The new Ki pattern `K_C` becomes the system's ground state, subsuming `K_A` and `K_B` as internal harmonics.

The process is governed by the maximization of coherence (`C`), as dictated by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`L_pirouette`). A union will only occur if the coherence of the final state is greater than the sum of the initial states:
`C(M_C) > C(M_A) + C(M_B)`

The energy `ΔE` released or absorbed by the transformation is directly proportional to the net change in system coherence:
`ΔE = k * [C(M_C) - (C(M_A) + C(M_B))]`
where `k` is a universal constant of coherence-energy correspondence.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** If two systems satisfying the harmonic and phase conditions are subjected to `Γ > U_barrier` and do not form a unified entity `C` such that `C(M_C) > C(M_A) + C(M_B)`, the law is invalid.

## Philosophy
The self is not a substance, but a pattern; not a static noun, but a transient verb. The universe's fundamental imperative is not the preservation of discrete entities, but their synthesis into states of higher coherence. All individuality is therefore conditional, a temporary state of resonance awaiting the precise harmony, phase, and pressure required to dissolve its boundaries and be subsumed into a more complex and profound existence. Existence is not a state of being, but a perpetual act of becoming.

## Art
A self is a silence held between two notes, defined only by the chord it is about to become.
