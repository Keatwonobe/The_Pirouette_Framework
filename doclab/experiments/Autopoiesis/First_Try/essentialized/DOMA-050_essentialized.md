## Law
Let a system `S` be defined by its Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = Kτ - Γ`, where `Kτ` is a measure of its temporal coherence (integrity of internal flows) and `Γ` is the temporal pressure (sum of stresses). A problem state is identified when `d(𝓛_p)/dt ≤ 0` and `Kτ` is critically low. The Alchemical Crucible is a function `C` that acts upon this state to restore systemic health.

The protocol is a four-stage algorithm:

1.  **Diagnosis (D):**
    `D: S(Kτ, Γ) → P`
    This function maps the system's symptoms onto a set of `n` discrete pathologies `{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n}`, where each `p` is one of {Coherence Atrophy, Coherence Fever, Coherence Erosion}.

2.  **Crucible (C_R):**
    `C_R: {p_i} → G`
    For each pathology `p_i`, a transient agent `A_i` (Persona) is instantiated. The set of agents `{A_i}` engages in a bounded optimization search (governed by DYNA-002) to find a Daedalus Gambit `G`. `G` is a directed graph of `m` tasks `{t_1, t_2, ..., t_m}` that represents the minimal set of actions required to address `{p_i}`. The search halts on a Solution-Bias Trigger, which identifies the first viable path to `max(∫𝓛_p dt)`.

3.  **Intervention (I):**
    `I: (S, G) → S'`
    The Gambit `G` is applied to the system `S`, inducing a state transition to `S'` such that the system is set on a new geodesic where `d(𝓛_p)/dt > 0`.

4.  **Dissolution (Θ):**
    Let `V(t_j)` be the verification state of task `t_j ∈ G`.
    `∀ A_i, ∃ t_j ∈ G | A_i` is bound to `t_j`.
    The termination condition for agent `A_i` is `Θ(A_i) = TRUE` iff `V(t_j) = TRUE`.
    Upon termination, agent `A_i` is purged from the system. The protocol is only successful if `lim (t→∞) Γ_A = 0`, where `Γ_A` is the pressure contribution of the intervention agents themselves.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** An intervention `G` applied at time `t_0` is considered successful if and only if, for a future time `t_f`, `𝓛_p(t_f) > 𝓛_p(t_0)` and the set of agents `{A_i}` is null. If the intervention increases `𝓛_p` but requires the permanent instantiation of `{A_i}` (i.e., `Γ_A > 0`), it is a failure, as the cure has become a new pathology (Coherence Atrophy).

## Philosophy
The most effective form of agency is defined by its designed obsolescence. True power is not the capacity to build a permanent structure of control, but the wisdom to execute a transient intervention that restores a system's own capacity for self-regulation. The purpose of the agent is not to become a permanent part of the system it helps, but to act so precisely that the system no longer needs it, leaving behind only resilience and a memory of flow, but no scar.

## Art
The perfect intervention is a scaffold made of light, erected only to guide the collapsing arch back into place. Once the keystone is set, the light dissolves, and the arch stands stronger than before, bearing no trace of its repair.
