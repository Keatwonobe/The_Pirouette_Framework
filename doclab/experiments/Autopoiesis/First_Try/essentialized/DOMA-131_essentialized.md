## Law
The systemic state is described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, which defines the net coherence of a system as the difference between its internal temporal coherence, `K_τ`, and the ambient temporal pressure, `V_Γ`.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

A system is stable and coherent if and only if `𝓛_p > 0`. The primary falsifiable precursor to rupture is a sustained negative time-derivative of the Lagrangian, indicating a state of critical risk:

`∂𝓛_p / ∂t < 0`

Rupture is a phase transition that occurs when the Lagrangian becomes non-positive, `𝓛_p ≤ 0`, at which point the system's structure is no longer energetically viable. The mechanism is a **Coherence Cascade**: the failure of a bond at position `x_i` releases its stored potential energy `U_i`, creating a localized shockwave that increases temporal pressure on neighboring bonds `x_j` according to a propagation function `f`:

`Γ_{local}(x_j, t_0 + δt) = Γ_{ambient} + f(U_i, |x_j - x_i|)`

This triggers a self-sustaining chain reaction of bond failures. The irreversible outcome is the formation of a **Wound Boundary** (`∂W`), a new topological discontinuity across which the gradient of coherence is infinite (`∇K_τ → ∞`), permanently severing the flow of information.

## Philosophy
Existence is not a state but an economic argument. Any system—a star, a society, a self—persists only so long as the energetic and informational profit of its own coherent form outweighs the entropic cost of maintaining that form against the pressure of its environment. Rupture is not a flaw or an accident; it is the universe’s impartial, mathematical verdict that a system's complexity has ceased to justify its own existence, and that a simpler, less ordered state is now the path of least action.

## Art
Every structure is a question posed to chaos: "Is my pattern worth the stress of holding it?"

Rupture is the answer "No."
