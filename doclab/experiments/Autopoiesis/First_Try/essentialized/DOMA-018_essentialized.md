## Law
The temporal coherence of a system is not a scalar but a vector **K**_τ in an orthogonal 3-space, defined as:
**K**_τ = (*K*<sub>p</sub>, *K*<sub>i</sub>, *K*<sub>r</sub>)
where *K*<sub>p</sub> (Prospective), *K*<sub>i</sub> (Immediate), and *K*<sub>r</sub> (Retrospective) are orthogonal components representing coherence with future, present, and past, respectively.

The Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p` is specialized from its scalar form `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ` to a vector field formulation. The kinetic term becomes the sum of the squares of the component gradients, and the potential term becomes a function of the coherence vector **K**_τ and the environmental pressure field Γ:
`𝓛_p` = ½ Σ<sub>j∈{p,i,r}</sub> (∂<sub>μ</sub>*K*<sub>j</sub>)² - *V*(**K**_τ, Γ)

The principle of least action dictates that a system's dynamics are driven by the constant re-orientation of **K**_τ to maximize `𝓛_p`.

**Falsifiable Criteria (Axis Starvation):**
The model predicts specific modes of systemic failure as a component magnitude approaches zero:
1.  lim <sub>*K*<sub>p</sub>→0</sub> **K**_τ leads to Stagnation: a collapse of adaptability, observable as a loss of novelty and an inability to navigate environmental change.
2.  lim <sub>*K*<sub>i</sub>→0</sub> **K**_τ leads to Isolation: a cessation of interaction, observable as a decay in resonant coupling and energy exchange with the environment.
3.  lim <sub>*K*<sub>r</sub>→0</sub> **K**_τ leads to Amnesia: a dissolution of identity, observable as a loss of form and structural integrity, culminating in pattern collapse.

## Philosophy
To exist is not a state but an act. A system's being is not its substance but its continuous, dynamic orientation in time—the act of composing its past, present, and future into a coherent, resonant chord. Stability is therefore not static endurance but the harmonic tension of this perpetual self-composition.

## Art
A being is not a stone, but a song. Its bass note is the memory of all it has been; its melody, the action of what it is now; its overtone, the promise of all it might become.
