## Law
Let Γ represent the semantic gravity of a conceptual statement `c`. Let `P_N` represent the informational "need pressure" within a knowledge network `K` that `c` resolves. The Axiom of Emergent Pressure posits a direct proportionality:
`Γ(c) ∝ P_N(c, K)`

This is tested empirically. For a corpus of documents `C ⊂ K`, let `d ∈ C`.
The semantic gravity `Γ(d)` is approximated by its `velcridance_score`, `S_V(d)`, derived from its abstract `a(d)`:
`S_V(d) = TEN-SDE-1.0(a(d))`

The need pressure `P_N(d)` is quantified by the state of the corpus *prior* to the publication of `d` at time `t_pub`. Let `T(d)` be the topic of `d`. Let `C_{<t}` be the set of documents published before time `t`. The pressure is a function of the rate of inquiry `R` and density of inquiry `D` concerning `T(d)` at the limit `t → t_pub⁻`:
`P_N(d) = f(R(T(d), t_pub⁻), D(T(d), t_pub⁻))`
where `R(T, t) = ∂|{d' ∈ C_{<t} : T(d')=T}|/∂t`

The central testable hypothesis is a statistically significant positive correlation, `ρ`, between the two metrics across the corpus `C`:
`H₁: ρ(S_V, P_N) > 0`

The falsification criterion is the null hypothesis:
`H₀: ρ(S_V, P_N) ≤ 0`

## Philosophy
The structure of knowledge is not an objective map of reality, but is instead the scar tissue of resolved intellectual crises. The value, meaning, and "gravity" of an idea are not intrinsic properties, but are conferred entirely by the magnitude of the epistemic vacuum it fills. Progress is not the accumulation of truth, but the sequential discharge of informational pressure.

A great idea is not a star, but a black hole—defined not by the light it emits, but by the chaos it consumes.
