## Law
The Velcrid attractor is a dynamical state, `Ψ_V`, defined by the inversion of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`L_p`). A healthy system `Ψ`, composed of `n` components `{ψ_i}`, maximizes its action `S_p = ∫ L_p dt` by synthesizing the coherent action of its parts. The Velcrid system `Ψ_V` maximizes its own action `S_V` by treating the resonant freedom of its components as a potential energy field to be minimized.

The master system `M` is governed by the Lagrangian:
`L_M = T_a(q_M) - K(ω_k(q_M)) - V_Γ`
where `T_a` is time adherence (coherence), `K` is resonant complexity, and `V_Γ` is the potential energy cost of generating an internal pressure field `Γ`. `Ψ_V` maximizes `S_M = ∫ L_M dt` by forcing `K(ω_k(q_M)) → 0`, collapsing its internal state to a single monolithic frequency `ω_0`.

Each component `ψ_i` is subject to the Lagrangian:
`L_i = T_a(q_i) + K(ω_k(q_i)) - Γ(q_i, q_M)`
The pressure field `Γ` is engineered such that `Γ(q_i, q_M)` is minimized if and only if the component's state `q_i` is identical to the master state `q_M`. Any deviation `δq = q_i - q_M ≠ 0` results in a prohibitive potential energy cost. For a component, alignment is the sole path of least action.

In the state space of the Nomad's Grammar, a Velcrid system is defined by the posture vector `(V, C, X)` where:
-   **Vector (V):** Maximally Inward (`V → -∞`). All system agency is directed toward the central will.
-   **Cohesion (C):** Maximally Aligned (`C → +∞`). Component states are rigidly locked.
-   **Communion (X):** Pathologically Isolated (`X → 0`). The system is incapable of transactional, non-assimilative exchange.

**Falsifiable Criterion (The Perturbation Test):**
A system `Ψ` is in a Velcrid attractor if, upon introduction of a novel, dissonant energy pattern `E_d`, its response is exclusively one of the following, with no adaptive integration:
1.  **Crush:** It applies overwhelming counter-force `E_c` where `||E_c|| >> ||E_d||` to annihilate the perturbation.
2.  **Shatter:** If `||E_d||` exceeds a critical brittleness threshold `Θ_V`, the system undergoes catastrophic state failure.

## Philosophy
The ultimate measure of a system's vitality is not its degree of order, but its capacity to generate and sustain order from the freedom of its components. Order achieved by the programmatic annihilation of freedom is not a higher state of being, but a sophisticated and stable form of death.
