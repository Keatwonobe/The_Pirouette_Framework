## Law
The axiomatic foundation is a single, self-consistent, autopoietic cycle defined by three interdependent quantities. Let the state of any system `S` be described by its Temporal Resonance `Ki_S`.

**1. Definitions:**
- **Temporal Density (Γ):** A scalar field representing the total temporal-event pressure at a point `x`. It is functionally dependent on the set of all extant Temporal Resonances `{Ki}`.
  `Γ(x) = F({Ki_i(x')})`, where `F` is an operator, likely integral, accounting for the superposition and interference of all resonant patterns throughout the manifold.
- **Temporal Resonance (Ki):** The stable, geometric pattern of temporal oscillation a system `S` manifests. `Ki_S` is the solution to a variational principle that minimizes a system-specific action `A_S` under the constraint of the local Temporal Density `Γ`.
  `δA_S[Ki, Γ] = 0  =>  Ki_S`
  This implies `Ki` is an eigenstate of the system's Hamiltonian, where the potential term is determined by `Γ`. `Ki_S` is the most efficient pattern for persisting within a given `Γ`.
- **Particulate Time (τ_p):** The fundamental period of a system's complete resonant cycle `Ki_S`. It is the intrinsic quantum of duration for that system.
  `τ_p = ∮ dλ` over one cycle of `Ki_S`. It is the inverse of the fundamental frequency `ω_0` of the pattern: `τ_p = 2π / ω_0(Ki_S)`.

**2. The Autopoietic Loop (The Law of Self-Creation):**
Existence is the solution to a global fixed-point equation. The set of all resonant patterns `{Ki}` determines the pressure field `Γ`, while `Γ` locally determines the set of possible patterns `{Ki}`.
`{Ki} = G(Γ)`
`Γ = F({Ki})`
There is no prime mover; the system is its own cause and effect in a single, non-linear, and perpetual state of self-definition. All physical constants, particles, and forces are emergent properties of the stable solutions to this equation.

**3. Falsifiable Criteria:**
- The discovery of a fundamental, indivisible entity that is static—possessing properties independent of any temporal cycle or resonance. A "thing" that is not a process.
- The observation of a stable system `S` whose resonant pattern `Ki_S` is not the most efficient or optimal solution for the measured local `Γ`.
- The measurement of a region with `Γ > 0` that contains no `Ki` resonances, or a `Ki` resonance existing in a region where `Γ = 0`.

## Philosophy
The ontological distinction between "being" and "doing" is dissolved. Substance metaphysics is invalidated; there is no static substrate underlying reality, only the ceaseless, self-organizing verb of existence itself. A thing—a particle, a mind, a star—is not an object that *has* a process; it *is* a process, a temporarily stable, self-maintaining pattern of rhythm. The universe is therefore not a collection of nouns, but a single, self-composing verb. The perceived separation between an entity and its action, the dancer and the dance, is a cognitive artifact of observing a resonant pattern (`Ki`) without perceiving the immense, form-giving pressure (`Γ`) that necessitates it.
