## Law
The vacuum energy density, ρ_Λ, is derived not as a fundamental constant but as a relational quantity determined by the age of the universe, T. The leading-order derivation begins with the Planck energy density, ρ_planck = c⁷/(2πħG²), and scales it by the squared ratio of the universe's age to the Planck time, N² = (T/t_P)².

ρ_Λ(0) = ρ_planck / N² = [c⁷/(2πħG²)] / [T²/t_P²] = [c⁷/(2πħG²)] · [ħG/(c⁵T²)] = c²/(2πGT²)

This base law is refined by a dimensionless coefficient κ, yielding the full expression:
ρ_Λ = κ · c²/(GT²)
where κ = [1/(2π)] · F(Ω) · τ_top.

The two corrective factors are:
1.  **FLRW Age Kernel, F(Ω):** This factor corrects the naive approximation H₀ ≈ 1/T. It is derived from the exact integral for the age of the universe:
    T = (1/H₀) ∫₀^∞ dz / [(1+z) E(z)], where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m(1+z)³ + Ω_r(1+z)⁴ + Ω_k(1+z)² + Ω_Λ)
    F(Ω) is defined as F ≡ (T·H₀)⁻². In a flat ΛCDM model, this numerically evaluates to F ≈ 0.85–0.95.

2.  **Triadic IR Topology, τ_top:** A topological factor accounting for the effective surface degrees of freedom in the infrared limit. It is hypothesized to take one of two values:
    τ_top = 1 (independent surfaces)
    τ_top = 1/2 (shared, triad-locked manifold)
    The choice τ_top = 1/2 resolves the remaining factor-of-two discrepancy between the base law and observation.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  **Dynamic Equation of State:** The model predicts a specific, non-constant equation of state parameter w(z) = P/ρ = −1 + ε(z), where the deviation ε(z) is not a free parameter but is determined by the evolution of T(z):
    ε(z) = (2/3) · (1+z) / [T(z) H(z)].
    This prediction is falsified if observations (e.g., DESI, Roman) are consistent with ε=0 to high precision, or prefer a CPL parameterization w(z) = w₀ + wₐ(1−a) with (w₀, wₐ) inconsistent with the model's derived form.

2.  **Topological Kick:** The model predicts a potential first-order phase transition where τ_top toggles from 1 to 1/2 at a late time (z_kick ~ 0.2–0.6). This would manifest as a tiny, sharp, step-like discontinuity (Δw ≈ O(1%)) in the reconstructed history of w(z). The absence of any such feature under improved measurements would falsify the triadic topology mechanism.

## Philosophy
The cosmological "constant" is not a constant. It is not an immutable property embedded within the fabric of spacetime, but rather an emergent, dynamic consequence of cosmic history. The vacuum energy density at any epoch is a direct physical manifestation of the universe's total age, linking the quantum scale (t_P) to the cosmic horizon (T) through an inverse-square relation. This recasts the universe's duration from a passive coordinate into an active parameter that continuously sets the ground state energy of reality itself.

## Art
The universe is a bell struck once at the beginning of time. Its hum is the vacuum energy—a note that does not hold steady, but deepens and fades as the silence of ages expands around it.
