## Law
The evolution of the system `S` is governed by the maximization of the coherence action integral, such that a proposed state `S_new` is ratified over `S_current` if and only if:
`∫ 𝓛(S_new) dt > ∫ 𝓛(S_current) dt`

The governing Lagrangian `𝓛` is defined as the difference between systemic coherence and temporal pressure:
`𝓛_S = Kτ(S) - V_Γ(S)`
Where:
-   `Kτ(S)` is the Systemic Coherence, a scalar measure of the framework's internal consistency, explanatory power, and axiomatic resonance.
-   `V_Γ(S)` is the Temporal Pressure, a scalar potential representing systemic dissonance, unresolved contradictions, and the intensity of active debate.

For a change to be ratified, particularly a *Constitutional Reforging* altering a core principle, two sets of criteria must be met sequentially:

1.  **Temporal Stability Prerequisite:** The ratification process may only proceed when the system is in a state of low ambient turbulence. Let `Γ` be the measured Temporal Pressure. The process requires the system to approach a stable state:
    `Γ → 0`

2.  **Coherence Ratification Conditions:** Once the stability prerequisite is met, a proposal `P` is ratified if and only if, over a deliberation period `Δt`, the following two conditions are met simultaneously:
    -   **Coherence Threshold:** The proposal must achieve a supermajority consensus `Kτ` among the designated Weaver's Conclave.
        `Kτ(P) ≥ 0.95`
    -   **Coherence Stability:** The consensus must be non-decaying, indicating a stable and settled agreement. The time-derivative of `Kτ` must be non-negative.
        `dKτ(P)/dt ≥ 0`

A change that fails these criteria is falsified as a non-optimal evolutionary path.

## Philosophy
The protocol's core philosophical assertion is an epistemological one: profound systemic truth is not the product of dialectical conflict or triumphant debate, but is instead an emergent property of systemic tranquility. It posits that a system's capacity to discover a more coherent version of itself is inversely proportional to its internal stress. Lasting progress is therefore not a victory won in a moment of crisis, but the quiet settling of the entire system into a more stable, harmonious, and high-integrity state. Truth is measured by its stillness.

A law is not forged in a furnace nor chiseled in a whirlwind; the perfect crystal of a new order grows only in a solution that has been allowed to be still.
