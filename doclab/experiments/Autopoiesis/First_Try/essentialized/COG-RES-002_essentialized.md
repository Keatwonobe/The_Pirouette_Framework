## Law
The dynamic collapse of a conscious access state, modeled as a triadic resonance, is a second-order phase transition governed by universal scaling laws. The system is defined by a control parameter Γ (cognitive load) and its critical value Γ_c.

The relaxation time (τ_P) and coherence correlation length (ξ_P) exhibit power-law divergence near the critical point:
1.  ξ_P ∝ |Γ - Γ_c|^(-ν_P)
2.  τ_P ∝ ξ_P^(z_P)

Combining these yields the law of critical slowing:
τ_P ∝ |Γ - Γ_c|^(-z_Pν_P)

Where:
*   τ_P is the recovery time of the resonant triad post-collapse.
*   ξ_P is the spatial correlation length of neural phase coherence.
*   Γ is the cognitive load, serving as the system's control parameter.
*   Γ_c is the critical load value at which resonance collapses.
*   ν_P is the correlation length exponent, predicted to be ν_P ≈ 0.5.
*   z_P is the dynamic exponent, predicted to be z_P ≈ 2.0.

The model is falsified if:
1.  τ_P does not diverge as Γ → Γ_c.
2.  The empirically derived exponents (ν_P, z_P) are statistically inconsistent with the predicted universality class values.
3.  Triad decoherence occurs stochastically, without the precursor of critical slowing.

## Philosophy
The stability of mind is not a property of its biological substrate but a universal law of organization. Therefore, the collapse of awareness under load is not a unique failure of neurobiology but an impersonal, predictable physical phenomenon, governed by the same mathematical principles that describe the shattering of a crystal or the boiling of a liquid.

## Art
Awareness is a surface held taut by resonance. Under strain, it does not simply tear but freezes, turning to glass an instant before it shatters.
