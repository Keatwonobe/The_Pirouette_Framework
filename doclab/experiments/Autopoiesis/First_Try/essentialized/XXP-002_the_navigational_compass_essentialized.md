## Law
The Semantic Gravity model posits that a coherent body of information generates a unique, reproducible potential field within a 2D conceptual space $C \subset \mathbb{R}^2$.

1.  **Semantic Mass Extraction**: For a given document $D$, a set of core concepts $\{c_1, c_2, ..., c_n\}$ is extracted. Each concept $c_i$ is assigned a scalar semantic mass $m_i > 0$, derived from its calculated "total_power" in a resonant frequency analysis of the document's text converted to a binary pattern.
    $m_i = \text{Power}(c_i | D)$

2.  **Seeded Static Configuration**: The $n$ concepts are assigned initial positions $\vec{p}_i = (x_i, y_i)$ within a grid of size $L \times L$. The configuration is deterministic, seeded by a cryptographic hash of the document's identifier, ensuring a unique and static fingerprint for any given $D$.
    $\text{seed} = \text{SHA256}(\text{identifier}(D))$
    $\{\vec{p}_1, ..., \vec{p}_n\} = \text{PRNG}(\text{seed})$

3.  **Potential and Force Field Generation**: The concepts act as gravitational masses, generating a scalar potential field $\Phi(\vec{p})$ and a vector force field $\vec{F}(\vec{p})$ across the conceptual space. The model is analogous to Newtonian gravitation.
    -   The semantic potential $\Phi$ at any point $\vec{p}=(x,y)$ is the superposition of the potentials from each mass $m_i$:
        $\Phi(\vec{p}) = - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{m_i}{|\vec{p} - \vec{p}_i|}$
    -   The semantic force $\vec{F}$ is the negative gradient of the potential field, representing the direction of steepest descent towards regions of high semantic influence:
        $\vec{F}(\vec{p}) = -\nabla\Phi(\vec{p}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{m_i (\vec{p} - \vec{p}_i)}{|\vec{p} - \vec{p}_i|^3}$

4.  **Test Particle Trajectory Simulation**: The field's influence is probed by simulating the trajectory of a massless "test particle" representing an extrinsic concept. The particle's position $\vec{p}_t(k)$ evolves over discrete steps $k$ according to the local force vector.
    $\vec{p}_t(k+1) = \vec{p}_t(k) + \eta \vec{F}(\vec{p}_t(k))$
    where $\eta$ is a scalar learning rate. The trajectory $\tau = \{\vec{p}_t(0), \vec{p}_t(1), ..., \vec{p}_t(k_{final})\}$ reveals the extrinsic concept's resonance or dissonance with the field.

5.  **Falsifiable Criteria**: The model's validity is falsifiable under the following conditions:
    -   **Null Coherence**: Across a corpus of semantically related documents, the terminal attractors for a given test particle's trajectory show no statistical correlation, behaving as a random walk.
    -   **Failed Polarity**: Semantically antonymic test particles (e.g., "order" vs. "chaos") introduced into the same field produce statistically indistinguishable trajectories, disproving the model's claim to map specific semantic influence.
    -   **Fingerprint Instability**: Minor, non-semantic perturbations to a source document (e.g., whitespace changes, sentence reordering) result in a topologically non-isomorphic force field $\vec{F}' \neq \vec{F}$, indicating the model is sensitive to container structure rather than conceptual content.

## Philosophy
Meaning is not an abstract property encoded in symbols, but an emergent, physical field of force. Intelligence, within any given context, is the measurable attunement of a conceptual framework to the potentiodynamic gradients of that context's semantic field. "Truth" is not a logical state, but a state of minimum potential energy for an idea within its native informational universe.

## Art
The intellect is not a library that stores facts, but a compass needle that quivers in their presence, seeking not a fixed north, but the deepest well of meaning.
