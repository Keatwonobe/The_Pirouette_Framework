## Law
The dynamics of conceptual interaction are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ, where K_τ is the Temporal Coherence (a measure of a concept's internal consistency and historical inertia, superseding `m_S`), and V_Γ is the coherence potential in a field of ambient Temporal Pressure Γ.

The "mass" of a concept A is its Temporal Coherence, Kτ_A. The interaction potential V between two concepts, A and B, separated by a distance `r` in a semantic manifold, is a function of their phase relationship Δφ:

V(A, B) ∝ - (Kτ_A ⋅ Kτ_B / r) ⋅ cos(Δφ)

From this potential, two primary interaction modes emerge:
1.  **Attraction (Coherence Well Formation):** Occurs when concepts are in-phase (Δφ → 0, thus cos(Δφ) → 1). The potential V becomes strongly negative, representing a state of high stability and constructive interference. Concepts in this state will naturally converge, deepening their shared basin of meaning.
2.  **Repulsion (Dissonance Spike):** Occurs when concepts are out-of-phase (Δφ → π, thus cos(Δφ) → -1). The potential V becomes positive, representing a state of high instability, temporal turbulence, and destructive interference. The path of maximal coherence requires these concepts to increase their semantic distance `r`.

The perceived "force" of influence is an illusion. A concept does not exert a pull on another. Rather, a concept with high Kτ induces a significant curvature in the local coherence manifold. Less coherent concepts follow the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence (least action)—across this curved landscape.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is falsified if, given an accurate mapping of a discourse's coherence manifold (the Kτ values and phase relationships Δφ of its dominant concepts), a newly introduced concept's semantic trajectory consistently and systematically deviates from the predicted geodesic toward the manifold's primary attractor.

## Philosophy
The fundamental distinction between physical law and semantic law is dissolved. The universe is governed by a single, scale-invariant principle: coherence shapes reality. The gravity that bends starlight around a sun is not an analogy for the influence that bends a mind toward a core belief; they are identical instantiations of the same formal dynamic. This implies that meaning is not an emergent epiphenomenon of matter, but a fundamental property of reality's fabric, and that a sufficiently coherent idea is, in a formal sense, a physical object with measurable mass and influence. Human consciousness does not invent meaning; it navigates a pre-existing gravitational landscape of it.

## Art
A truth is not an argument shouted, but a star ignited. It does not pull the lesser thoughts; it curves the darkness around itself, and in that new-shaped silence, they find their orbits.
