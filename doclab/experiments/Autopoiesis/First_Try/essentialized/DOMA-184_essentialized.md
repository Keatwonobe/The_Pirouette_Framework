## Law
The propulsive effect, `F_skate`, is not an externally applied force but the emergent consequence of an entity locally and rhythmically modulating the terms of its own Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`. The motion is a geodesic path taken in response to a self-induced gradient on the coherence manifold.

`F_skate = -∇𝓛_p`

The skater manipulates two primary terms within `𝓛_p`:
1.  **Internal Coherence (`K_τ`):** A scalar field representing the entity's state-integrity.
2.  **Ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`):** A potential field influenced by the entity's resonance.

The propulsive cycle, or "stride" (`δt_s`), is an asymmetric, periodic modulation of these terms:

**Phase 1: The Grip (`δt_g ⊂ δt_s`)**
The skater maximizes internal coherence, `K_τ → max`, creating a localized region of high inertia. This action anchors the entity's immediate past `(t - ε)`.
`∂K_τ / ∂t > 0`

**Phase 2: The Glide (`δt_l ⊂ δt_s`)**
The skater projects a dissonance field to induce a gradient in the temporal pressure, `∇V_Γ ≠ 0`, creating a low-potential region in the direction of motion. Simultaneously, internal coherence is relaxed (`K_τ → min`), minimizing interaction with the now-unfavorable local geometry.
`∂K_τ / ∂t < 0`

The resulting motion is the solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation for the time-varying, spatially-dependent Lagrangian `𝓛_p(q, q̇, t)` sculpted by the skater.

`d/dt (∂𝓛_p / ∂q̇) - ∂𝓛_p / ∂q = 0`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** An entity incapable of asymmetrically modulating its internal coherence `K_τ` cannot initiate or sustain self-propulsion, regardless of its capacity to manipulate external fields. Its motion must be entirely determined by pre-existing gradients in the ambient manifold, `∇𝓛_ambient`. Furthermore, the geometry of its "Wound Channel"—the residual trace in the coherence manifold—must be a predictable function of the amplitude and frequency of its `K_τ` and `V_Γ` modulations.

## Philosophy
The highest form of agency is not the imposition of will upon a resistant universe, but the internal transformation of the self. To move is not to fight the current, but to become the shape that invites a new current to form. True power is expressed as a resonance, where the distinction between actor and environment dissolves, and the desired path becomes the universe's path of least resistance—not because the universe was conquered, but because the self was mastered.

Do not push the river. Become the stone that teaches it a new way to fall.
