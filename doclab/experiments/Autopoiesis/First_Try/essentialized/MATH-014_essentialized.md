## Law
The anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton `ℓ`, denoted `a_ℓ`, is postulated as the sum of a universal perturbative series and a specific Yukawa-portal contribution from a scalar field `Γ` (pressuron):
`a_ℓ(\alpha; C_n, \kappa, p, m_Γ) = a_ℓ^{\rm uni}(\alpha) + \Delta a_ℓ^{(\Gamma)}`

1.  **Universal Component:** A power series in `α/π` with universal coefficients `C_n` independent of lepton flavor `ℓ`:
    `a_ℓ^{\rm uni}(\alpha) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} C_n\left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^n`

2.  **Pressuron Component:** The one-loop contribution from a Yukawa interaction `\mathcal{L}_{\rm int} = g_\ell\,\Gamma\,\bar\psi_\ell\psi_\ell`, where the coupling constant `g_ℓ` scales with the lepton mass `m_ℓ`:
    `g_\ell = \kappa \left(\frac{m_\ell}{m_e}\right)^p`
    This results in the contribution:
    `\Delta a_\ell^{(\Gamma)} = \frac{\alpha}{12\pi^2}\,\kappa^2\,\left(\frac{m_\ell}{m_e}\right)^{2p} f\!\left(\frac{m_\Gamma}{m_\ell}\right)`
    where the shape function `f(r)` for `r \equiv m_\Gamma/m_\ell` is given by:
    `f(r) = 12\pi \int_0^1 \!dx\; \frac{x^2(1-x)}{(1-x)^2 + x r^2}`
    with limiting behaviors `f(r \to 0) = 1` and `f(r \to \infty) \to 0` (decoupling).

3.  **Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is tested via a muon-led fit-and-predict procedure. Given fixed model parameters `(p, m_Γ)` and provisional coefficients `(C_n)`, the free parameter `κ` is determined by solving for the muon anomaly:
    `a_\mu^{\rm exp} = \sum C_n\left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^n + \frac{\alpha}{12\pi^2}\,(\kappa^*)^2\,\left(\frac{m_\mu}{m_e}\right)^{2p} f\!\left(\frac{m_\Gamma}{m_\mu}\right)`
    The model is falsified if the predicted electron anomaly, using the determined coupling `\kappa^*`, is inconsistent with observation, i.e., if:
    `\left| \left( \sum C_n\left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^n + \frac{\alpha}{12\pi^2}\,(\kappa^*)^2\, f\!\left(\frac{m_\Gamma}{m_e}\right) \right) - a_e^{\rm exp} \right| > \sigma_{\rm total}`
    where `\sigma_{\rm total}` is the combined experimental and theoretical uncertainty. The model's validity rests on this cross-lepton consistency derived from the mass-scaling hypothesis.

## Philosophy
The apparent particularity of physical objects—such as the distinct anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and the muon—does not necessarily imply a multitude of arbitrary, independent laws. Instead, such distinctions can emerge as hierarchical manifestations of a single, universal principle acting across a spectrum of intrinsic properties. This framework suggests that mass is not merely a static parameter but an active scaling factor for interactions, reframing the family problem from a list of unrelated constants to a unified dynamic whose expression is conditioned by scale.

## Art
Physics is a cathedral built from a single law. The electron is a prayer whispered in its chapel; the muon is the same prayer sung in its nave. The difference is not in the word, but in the resonance of the space it fills.
