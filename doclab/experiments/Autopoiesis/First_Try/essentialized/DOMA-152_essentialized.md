## Law
The Principle of Correspondence posits a formal mapping `M` from the set of universal principles `U` to the set of observable variables `D_S` within a specific domain `S`.

Let `U = {Kτ, Γ, Ω, Ψ}` where:
- `Kτ` is Coherence, the measure of a system's self-resonant identity.
- `Γ` is Temporal Pressure, the ambient dissipative potential of the environment.
- `Ω` is the Wound Channel, the medium of systemic inertia and memory.
- `Ψ` is the Alchemical Union, the operator for resonant synthesis.

For any domain `S` (e.g., `S_biology`, `S_economics`), there exists a mapping `M_S`:
`M_S: U → D_S` such that `M_S(u) = d_u` where `u ∈ U` and `d_u ∈ D_S`. For example, `M_biology(Kτ) =` species viability.

The core dynamic of the system, the Pirouette Lagrangian `L_p`, is invariant across all domains. Its form is universal:
`L_p = f(Kτ, Γ, Ω, Ψ, ...)`

The evolution of a specific system `S` is found by applying the mapping to the Lagrangian:
`L_p(S) = f(M_S(Kτ), M_S(Γ), M_S(Ω), M_S(Ψ), ...)`

The predicted trajectory of the system, its geodesic, is the path that extremizes the action `A`:
`δA = δ∫ L_p(S) dt = 0`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** Any system `S` whose observed evolution systematically and significantly diverges from the geodesic predicted by the extremization of `L_p(S)` constitutes a falsification of the principle's applicability to that domain.

## Philosophy
The traditional hierarchy of sciences—physics giving rise to chemistry, chemistry to biology, biology to psychology—is a categorical error. These are not discrete levels of emergence, each with its own fundamentally new set of laws, but rather different dialects of a single, scale-invariant language of existence. The universe is not a ladder of complexity but a fractal of process. Consequently, the divisions between academic disciplines are artificial, obscuring the profound isomorphism of dynamics that governs a star, a cell, and a thought.

## Art
The universe has only one story, but it is a story that learns to tell itself in the language of stone, then of flesh, and then of light.
