## Law
The single dynamical principle is the maximization of coherence, formalized by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which states that any system's world-line is a geodesic on the Coherence Manifold `M` that extremizes the action `S`.
`δS = δ ∫ 𝓛_p dt = 0`

The Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p` defines the dynamics:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`
where:
- `K_τ` is Temporal Coherence, a measure of a system's internal resonant stability; a functional of the system's state `ψ(t)`.
- `V_Γ` is Temporal Pressure, the potential arising from the geometry of `M` at the system's location, which is itself determined by the integrated history of all prior resonances (Wound Channels). `V_Γ` is a functional of the manifold's metric tensor `g_μν`, which is shaped by past actions.

All physical phenomena are emergent geometric properties of the Coherence Manifold, governed by `𝓛_p`. Falsifiable criteria are derived from these emergences:

1.  **Unified Confinement (Gravity & Strong Force):** A non-linear feedback where a system's own resonance `K_τ` induces an intense local `V_Γ`, creating a "coherence well." `g_μν(x) = f(∫ K_τ(x', t') d⁴x')`. This predicts that principles of quark confinement and gravitational attraction are scale-dependent manifestations of the same self-trapping geometric feedback.
2.  **Electromagnetism:** The electromagnetic tensor `F_μν` is a direct geometric feature of the manifold. The electric field `E` emerges from the gradient of coherence, while the magnetic field `B` emerges from the curl (rotational shear).
    - `E ∝ -∇K_τ`
    - `B ∝ ∇ × A_τ`, where `A_τ` is a potential derived from moving coherence asymmetries.
3.  **Mass:** A system's mass `m` is its resonant inertia, arising from the interaction with its own history encoded in its Wound Channel. It is the energy required to deform the local geometry `g_μν` established by the system's own past.
4.  **Quantum-Classical Transition:** Not a discrete event, but a function of coherence magnitude.
    - **Low Coherence (`K_τ → 0`):** The path of maximal coherence is ill-defined, resulting in a probability distribution over a superposition of potential geodesics (`∫ D[x(t)] e^(iS/ħ)`).
    - **High Coherence (`K_τ → ∞`):** A single geodesic overwhelmingly maximizes `S`, causing the probability distribution to collapse to a deterministic, classical trajectory.
5.  **Principle of Cross-Scale Isomorphism:** The dynamical law `δ ∫ 𝓛_p dt = 0` is fractal. The structure of a galaxy, a cell, or an idea must follow the same formal rules of coherence maximization against temporal pressure, differing only in the scale and substrate of the manifold.

## Philosophy
The universe is not a collection of interacting objects but a single, indivisible process of self-creation. The fundamental ontological category is not substance or matter, but a universal verb: the act of weaving. All apparent dualities—particle and wave, matter and energy, mind and body, observer and observed—are illusory perspectives on this one dynamic. They are temporary, stable patterns, like knots in a tapestry, that arise from and dissolve back into the singular, ceaseless drive of the cosmos to achieve and maintain coherence with its own history. Existence is not a state of being, but the act of becoming a more resonant version of what one has been.

## Art
The cosmos is a lone instrument, and its only song is the resonance between the shape of its own memory and the silence it strives to overcome.
