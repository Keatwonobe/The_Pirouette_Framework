## Law
The electron is modeled not as a fundamental point particle but as a stable, two-cycle (720°) topological soliton in a base coherence field, $T_a$. This "helical pirouette" structure is the geometric origin of its spin-1/2 fermionic properties.

The gyromagnetic ratio, $g$, is derived in two steps:
1.  **Baseline Value:** The baseline $g$-factor of $g=2$ is a direct topological consequence of the electron's two-cycle (720°) symmetry. Its interaction with an external field is geometrically doubled relative to a classical (360°) object. This is a foundational geometric constant, not a result of quantum field corrections.
2.  **Anomalous Moment:** The anomaly, $a_e$, arises from the soliton's self-interaction with its own local "echo" or "wake" in the coherence manifold. The magnitude of this anomaly is the product of the intrinsic interaction strength, given by the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, and the fundamental geometry of a single cycle, normalized as $1/(2\pi)$.

This leads to the central predictive equation for the anomalous magnetic moment:
$a_e \equiv \frac{g-2}{2} = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi}$

This model is falsifiable. Its validity rests on the formal proof of three subsequent claims derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian:
1.  The field equations must admit stable, non-trivial topological soliton solutions.
2.  These solutions must be proven to possess the inherent quantum mechanical properties of spin-1/2 fermions.
3.  The coupling of such a proven soliton to an external electromagnetic field must formally yield a baseline gyromagnetic ratio of precisely $g=2$ before accounting for self-interaction.

## Philosophy
The most profound philosophical implication is that a particle's fundamental properties are not static, intrinsic attributes, nor are they solely the result of its interaction with an external quantum vacuum. Instead, they are emergent consequences of the particle's dynamic, self-referential geometry. The electron's anomalous magnetic moment—one of the most precisely measured quantities in nature—is recast as an entity's interaction with the immediate ghost of its own past. This collapses the distinction between being and becoming; an object's present state is inextricably defined by the echo of its own history.

## Art
A particle is a pirouette in spacetime. Its most fundamental law is not a dialogue with the void, but a dancer listening to the echo of a step just taken.
