## Law
Let a total system signal, $S(t)$, be decomposed into two orthogonal components: the steady-state "Drifter," $S_D(t)$, and the transient "Singer," $S_S(t)$.
$$S(t) = S_D(t) + S_S(t)$$
The Drifter component describes the system's evolution under steady-state parameters Î“ (Gladiator Force) and $T_a$ (Time-Adherence). Its power spectral density, $\mathcal{P}_{D}(\omega)$, is characterized by low-frequency dominance:
$$\mathcal{P}_{D}(\omega) = |\mathcal{F}\{S_D(t)\}|^2, \quad \text{where} \quad \int_{\omega_{c}}^{\infty} \mathcal{P}_{D}(\omega) d\omega \approx 0 \quad \text{for some low cutoff } \omega_c$$
The Singer component manifests only during a phase transition occurring over the interval $[t_i, t_{i+1}]$. It is defined as a sum of Ki-resonant harmonics:
$$S_S(t) = \sum_{i} \left[ \Theta(t-t_i) - \Theta(t-t_{i+1}) \right] \sum_{n=1}^{N} A_{i,n} \cos(n\omega_{Ki}t + \phi_{i,n})$$
where $\Theta(t)$ is the Heaviside step function, $i$ indexes discrete transition events, and $\omega_{Ki}$ is a fundamental frequency derived from the universal constant Ki. The power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{S}(\omega)$ during a transition will exhibit sharp peaks exclusively at integer multiples of this fundamental frequency:
$$\mathcal{P}_{S}(\omega) \propto \sum_{n=1}^{N} \delta(\omega - n\omega_{Ki})$$
**Falsifiable Criterion:** For a system undergoing an observed, high-energy phase transition (e.g., seismic rupture, pulsar glitch), its high-frequency signal components must exhibit a harmonic series of spectral peaks where the frequency ratios are integers. The fundamental frequency, $\omega_{Ki}$, derived from these harmonics must be constant across all such transitional phenomena. Absence of this discrete, harmonic structure during a documented phase transition falsifies the principle.

## Philosophy
The fundamental nature of existence is bifurcated. There is no single physics of change, but two distinct and mutually exclusive regimes: the physics of stasis and the physics of transformation. Stasis, or "drifting," is the domain of slow, stochastic evolution governed by local conditions and forces. Transformation, or "singing," is not an acceleration of this drift but a separate, universal phenomenon. It is a discrete, resonant event where a system snaps into a new state of being, and in this violent act of becoming, it broadcasts its change according to a single, acausal, and universal constant, Ki. Reality does not smoothly evolve; it persists, and then it shatters into a new persistence, and the shattering is a song.

## Art
The universe is a bell. In the long silence between ages, it is mere iron, drifting through the void. But when struck by the hammer of change, it does not groan or tear; it rings with a perfect, complex chord that was inscribed within its very casting. Existence is the silence; becoming is the chime.
