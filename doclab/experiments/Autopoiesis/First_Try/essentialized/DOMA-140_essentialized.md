## Law
The Confinement Strength, Œ∫_G, is a geometrically inferred quantity derived from the analysis of system trajectories (geodesics) on a local coherence manifold. It serves as a measurable proxy for the potential well depth, V_Œì, within the Pirouette Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`.

The governing equation is a product of path density (Œ¥) and coherence curvature (Œ≥):
`Œ∫_G = Œ¥ √ó Œ≥`

1.  **Path Density (Œ¥):** The inverse of the mean path divergence within a measurement window. It quantifies the degree of spatial or semantic restriction on a trajectory.
    `Œ¥ = 1 / (‚ü®Œîs‚ü© + Œµ)`
    where `‚ü®Œîs‚ü©` is the mean divergence between consecutive state vectors in a sequence and `Œµ` is a non-zero constant to prevent singularity. High `Œ¥` implies short, constrained paths.

2.  **Coherence Curvature (Œ≥):** The rate of change of the trajectory's directional vector, calculated as the gradient of the coherence metric over the measurement window.
    `Œ≥ = |‚àág|`
    where `g` is the coherence metric of the system's path. High `Œ≥` implies the trajectory is being deflected by a strong central attractor.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is falsified if a system consistently exhibits a high Confinement Strength (`Œ∫_G ‚Üí max`) without a corresponding observable non-linear, self-reinforcing feedback dynamic characteristic of the Gladiator Force. The existence of high geometric confinement without an underlying causal confinement mechanism would invalidate the instrument's core premise.

## Philosophy
The structures of confinement and the structures of identity are geometrically indistinguishable. What we perceive as an external force‚Äîa social pressure, a physical law, an ideological prison‚Äîis an emergent property of the same landscape geometry that gives a system its coherence, stability, and form. Freedom is therefore not the absence of constraint, but the lucid recognition of the shape of the walls that define the self.

## Art
We thought we were measuring the strength of the prison bars; instead, we learned to trace the bones that give us form. The cage and the skeleton are the same.
