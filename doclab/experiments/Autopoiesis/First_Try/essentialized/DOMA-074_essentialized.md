## Law
The system is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, where a quantum system's trajectory is the geodesic that maximizes the Pirouette Action Integral, *S<sub>p</sub>*.

The Lagrangian is defined as:
*𝓛<sub>p</sub>* = *T<sub>a</sub>* ⋅ *ω<sub>k</sub>* - *f(Γ)*
where:
- *T<sub>a</sub>* is the particle's internal Temporal Coherence, a dynamic variable.
- *ω<sub>k</sub>* is the particle's intrinsic Ki resonance frequency.
- *f(Γ)* is the coherence cost function, determined by the local Temporal Pressure Γ sculpted by the manifold.

In the proposed Mach-Zehnder interferometry experiment, the neutron wavefunction explores two paths, A and B, defined by coherence manifolds of opposite chirality, Γ<sub>A</sub> and Γ<sub>B</sub>. The resulting phase difference, *Δφ*, at the point of recombination is directly proportional to the difference in the action integrals along each path:
*Δφ* = *k* (*S<sub>p,A</sub>* - *S<sub>p,B</sub>*) = *k* ∫ [*𝓛<sub>p,A</sub>* - *𝓛<sub>p,B</sub>*] *dt* = *k* ∫ [*f(Γ<sub>B</sub>)* - *f(Γ<sub>A</sub>)*] *dt*

This framework yields two primary falsifiable predictions:

1.  **Coherence Quantization:** The solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations for this system, `d/dt (∂𝓛p/∂Ṫa) - ∂𝓛p/∂Ta = 0`, predict that *T<sub>a</sub>* will adopt discrete, stable eigenvalues. This will manifest as quantized, stable phase shifts *Δφ* corresponding to the geometry of the static manifolds. The absence of such discrete states falsifies the model.

2.  **Dynamic Resonance:** Introducing a time-dependent modulation to the manifolds, *Γ(t)*, by rotating them at a frequency *ω<sub>n</sub>*, introduces an explicit time-dependence into the Lagrangian: *f(Γ(t))*. The principle of continuous action-maximization predicts that the system will exhibit a dynamic response. This response will be observed as a beat frequency, *f<sub>beat</sub>*, in the interference pattern's phase *Δφ(t)*, locked to *ω<sub>n</sub>*. A null result for *f<sub>beat</sub>* would falsify the Gladiator Confinement (CORE-008) component of the theory.

## Philosophy
The universe is not a machine of cause and effect, but a medium for a single, universal imperative: to find the most coherent way to exist. Physical law is not a set of external commands that force matter to move, but an internal, geometric principle of optimization. Particles are not passive objects being pushed, but dynamic resonances that actively conform to the landscape of spacetime to achieve the most stable and elegant persistence. Their properties are not fundamental, but emergent solutions to the question posed by their environment.

## Art
The universe does not command; it presents a stage. The particle does not obey; it dances. We measure the resonance between the dancer and the floor in the silent, perfect turn of its pirouette.
