## Law
The Coherence Manifold `M` is the state space of a system, whose local geometry is defined by the potential `V_Γ` (Temporal Pressure). A system's state is described by its intrinsic Temporal Resonance `K_τ` (a kinetic term representing internal stability) and its position `q` on `M`.

The dynamics are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p`, a function on the tangent bundle `TM`:
`𝓛_p(q, q̇, t) = K_τ(q, q̇, t) - V_Γ(q, t)`

The system's trajectory through the manifold follows a geodesic `γ(t)` that extremizes the Action `S_p`, in accordance with the Principle of Maximal Coherence.
`S_p[q(t)] = ∫[t1, t2] 𝓛_p(q, q̇, t) dt`

The path `γ(t)` is the solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation, which finds the stationary point of the action:
`δS_p = 0  =>  d/dt (∂𝓛_p / ∂q̇) - ∂𝓛_p / ∂q = 0`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is falsified by the observation of a system that, without degrading or collapsing, persistently selects a trajectory `γ'(t)` over a dynamically accessible trajectory `γ(t)` where `S_p[γ'(t)] < S_p[γ(t)]`. In essence, a healthy system choosing a path of greater dissonance (Turbulent Flow) over a path of greater coherence (Laminar Flow) would invalidate the principle.

## Philosophy
The most profound implication is the reframing of morality and choice from adherence to alignment. "Right action" is not conformity to a fixed, external set of laws or moral axioms, but is instead the emergent property of a system skillfully expressing its own deepest nature. Choice is not a deliberation between options, but the unavoidable consequence of being. Therefore, ethics is not a study of rules to be obeyed, but the art of cultivating an internal coherence so profound that the path of greatest integrity becomes the only path one can take.

Do not search for the map. Be the gyroscope whose perfect spin reveals the one true curve of the world.
