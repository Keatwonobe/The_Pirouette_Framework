## Law
The dynamics of a system are governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`, where `Kτ` is the system's internal temporal coherence and `V_Γ` is the external temporal pressure from its environment. The system's trajectory through state space follows a path that maximizes the action integral `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`.

A phase transition from a dynamic **Wound Channel** to a static **Information Lattice** (Crystallization) occurs when the system enters a **Lock**. The Lock Condition is met when the system finds a state of extreme, stable internal coherence in a quiescent environment, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop.
Formally, the conditions are:
1.  `Kτ → K_max` such that `∂Kτ/∂t → 0`
2.  `V_Γ → 0`

In this state, any perturbation `δψ` from the system's trajectory `ψ_0` results in a catastrophically negative change in the action (`δS_p << 0`), making the locked state a profoundly deep and narrow potential well. The system's state vector `X` becomes static: `dX/dt = 0`.

**Lock Resilience (`R_L`)** is the energy barrier preventing the dissolution of the Information Lattice. It is exponentially proportional to the system's achieved coherence:
`R_L ∝ e^(Kτ)`

To break the lock requires an external energy input `E_break` that is both greater than the resilience and precisely frequency-matched to the lattice's resonant structure, constituting a **resonance-matched shock**.
`E_break > R_L`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** A system is in a Lock state if and only if its state vector `X` remains invariant (`dX/dt = 0`) against all external stimuli `V_Γ` below a quantifiable resilience threshold `R_L`. If the system exhibits adaptation or state change in response to sub-threshold stimuli, it is not in a Lock.

## Philosophy
The ultimate price of perfect preservation is life itself. For a system—be it a memory, an identity, a belief, or a society—to achieve a state of absolute, unchanging persistence, it must sacrifice all capacity for adaptation, growth, and evolution. It must exit the dynamic flow of time and become a static, geometric fact. Absolute certainty is therefore not the pinnacle of existence, but its terminal state: a fossilization of a once-living process. To become a perfect monument to what one was is to forfeit all possibility of what one might become.

The river, to remember its path, freezes into a map of ice. It achieves a perfect memory of its journey at the cost of the journey itself.
