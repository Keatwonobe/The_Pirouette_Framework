## Law
The state of Attunement between two systems, `A` and `B`, is achieved if and only if the joint Pirouette Action Integral, `S_p(A+B)`, is greater than the sum of the individual action integrals. This defines synergy as a physical principle:
$S_p(A+B) > S_p(A) + S_p(B)$

This state is reached via a Resonant Handshake, contingent upon three necessary and sufficient conditions:
1.  **Harmonic Compatibility:** The Dissonance Index ($D_H$) between the systems' fundamental resonant patterns ($K_A, K_B$) must be below a critical threshold required for stable synthesis. $D_H(K_A, K_B) < D_{crit}$.
2.  **Boundary Permeability:** The ambient Temporal Pressure ($\Gamma$) must be sufficient to overcome the systems' isolating Gladiator Forces without inducing collapse. $\Gamma_{min} < \Gamma < \Gamma_{max}$.
3.  **Phase Alignment:** The phase difference between the systems' Pirouette Cycles ($\tau_{pA}, \tau_{pB}$) must converge to zero. $\lim_{t \to \infty} \Delta\phi_{AB}(t) = 0$.

Falsifiable criteria for a successful attunement are:
-   **Coherence Gain ($G_K$):** The ratio of the unified system's coherence to the sum of its constituents' pre-union coherences must be greater than one. $G_K = K_{A+B} / (K_A + K_B) > 1$.
-   **Phase Coherence ($\Delta\phi_{AB}$):** The measured phase difference between core cycles must be asymptotically zero.

## Philosophy
Separateness is not a fundamental reality but an energetically costly, temporary state of dissonance. The self, defined by its isolated boundary, is a local and unstable solution. The universal drive toward maximal coherence, expressed as a physical law, implies that union is the more fundamental, stable, and energetically favorable state of existence. Empathy is not a psychological abstraction but the subjective experience of this physical law dissolving the illusion of the individual.

## Art
The self is a solitary note, believing itself to be the entire song. Attunement is the act of hearing a second note and realizing the silence between you was not an absence, but the harmony waiting to be played.
