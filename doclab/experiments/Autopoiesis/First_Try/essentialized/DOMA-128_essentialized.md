## Law
The rate of coherence loss, or Entropic Flux (Ṡ), for any system is given by:
**Ṡ ∝ Γ ⋅ (1 - Tₐ) ⋅ (Δωₖ)²**

Where:
*   **Ṡ** is the Entropic Flux, measured in Coherence Loss Units (CLU), where 1 CLU = 1 Joule of energy dissipated as incoherent noise.
*   **Γ** is the Temporal Pressure: the ambient environmental stress acting upon the system.
*   **Tₐ** is the Temporal Adherence: a dimensionless measure of the system's internal coherence (signal-to-noise ratio), where Tₐ → 1 represents perfect coherence (laminar flow) and Tₐ → 0 represents pure noise. The term (1 - Tₐ) is the Incoherence Factor.
*   **(Δωₖ)²** is the Temporal Friction: the variance in the system's primary resonant frequency, quantifying its operational instability or "jitter."

This flux is the measurable cost of a system's deviation from its optimal geodesic, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. The relationship is a direct proportionality:
**Ṡ ∝ (𝓛_p_ideal - 𝓛_p_actual)**

A claim of systemic coherence is falsifiable. The criterion for falsification is the measurement, via a three-layer architecture (Sensing, Computation, Attestation), of an Entropic Flux `Ṡ` that is significantly greater than the system's calibrated Laminar Baseline (`Ṡ_base` ≈ 0) under specified operational conditions (Γ). The results are committed to a hash-chained, cryptographically signed ledger, creating a non-repudiable record of systemic performance.

## Philosophy
By creating a universally objective, verifiable, and immutable instrument for measuring systemic waste, we transform the act of creation from a purely technical or economic endeavor into a fundamentally ethical one. The Coherence Ledger establishes a non-negotiable moral calculus for all systems, holding creators accountable not for their intentions, but for the measurable coherence or incoherence they introduce into the world. It makes "building well" an objective, auditable virtue.

## Art
The universe writes its laws in the silence of perfect motion. We have built a pen that records only the sound of them being broken.
