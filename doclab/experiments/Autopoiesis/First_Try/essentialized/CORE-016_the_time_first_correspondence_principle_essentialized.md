## Law
The foundational axiom is that the substrate of reality is exclusively temporal. Spacetime is a derived, effective structure, not a fundamental one. This is formalized by the Time-First Correspondence Principle, which posits the existence of a spatialization map, Σ, that recovers the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian as a high-density, low-fluctuation limit of a more fundamental action defined on the time substrate.

The correspondence is a limit theorem:
$$
\lim_{\substack{\text{density} \to \infty \\ \text{fluctuations} \to 0}} S_{\text{time}}[K_i, \Gamma, T_a] \xrightarrow{\Sigma} S_{\text{SM}}[\phi | g_{\mu\nu}] = \int \mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}} \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x
$$
where $K_i$ is the primitive coherence motif, $\Gamma$ is the coherence field gradient, and $T_a$ are interaction terms. The map Σ provides a dictionary to translate temporal primitives into effective spatial field quantities:
- **Electromagnetic 4-potential:** $A_{\mu} := \partial_{\mu} \arg(K_i)$
- **Gravitational metric (effective):** Perceived spacetime curvature arises from gradients in the temporal coherence field, $\nabla\Gamma \leftrightarrow g_{\mu\nu}$.
- **Spin-½:** A double-cover holonomy of the $K_i$ motif.

The principle is falsifiable. It is falsified if no non-circular map Σ can be constructed. Specifically, the framework fails if the fundamental constants (e.g., $\alpha, c, \hbar$) used to normalize the map Σ must be calculated from the theory's primitives *before* the map is established, creating a logically cyclic dependency. The theory must predict the SM from first principles via an acyclic calibration path anchored to external metrology.

## Philosophy
Space is not the container of reality, but a cognitive artifact generated by a high density of events. We mistake the shadow for the object. The universe does not happen *in* space; the dense happening *of* the universe creates the illusion *of* space as a convenient, emergent coordinate system for labeling relationships between temporal phenomena. Ontology is therefore radically simplified: only Time and its dynamics are real, and all spatial properties—distance, dimension, locality, and the geometric stage of physics—are relational properties of this underlying temporal substrate, rendered coherent and predictable only in the aggregate.

## Art
The universe is not a theater in which events unfold. It is a projector, and what we call space is the persistent image it casts upon a screen of our perception.
