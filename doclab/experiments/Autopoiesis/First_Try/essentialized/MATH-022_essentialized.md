## Law
The fundamental pressure-like term for the Pressuron, `P(X)=α X^{1+β}`, is derived from symmetry principles, not empirical fitting. The exponent `β` is fixed by the system's geometry and dynamics.

**1. Derivation from Scale Covariance:**
The action `S = ∫ dt d^d x P(X)` is invariant under the nonrelativistic Lifshitz scaling transformation `(t, x) → (λ^z t, λ x)`, where `z` is the dynamical exponent. The measure scales as `d(t d^d x) → λ^(z+d) d(t d^d x)`. The dominant term in `X` scales as `θ̇`, thus `X → λ⁻ᶻ X`. For `P(X) ∝ X^(1+β)`, the action's integrand transforms as `P(X) d(t d^d x) → λ⁻ᶻ⁽¹⁺ᵝ⁾ λ^(z+d) P(X) d(t d^d x)`. Invariance requires the exponent to be zero:
`-z(1+β) + z + d = 0`
`⇒ -zβ + d = 0`
`⇒ β = d/z`

**2. Principle of Active Dimension:**
The bulk spatial dimension `d` is replaced by the effective dimension `D_eff` of the coherence network (the wound channels or defects sourcing `X`). This yields the core relation:
`β = D_eff / z`

**3. Physical Constraints & Quantization:**
For a nonrelativistic superfluid, the dynamics are governed by `z=2`. The coherence network geometry is postulated to stabilize on integer-dimensional plateaus across scales (sheets, filaments, or points).
`D_eff ∈ {0, 1, 2}`
This quantizes the allowed values for the exponent `β`:
`β ∈ {0/2, 1/2, 2/2} = {0, 1/2, 1}`

**4. Discrete Scale Invariance (DSI) & Log-Periodicity:**
The postulate of a discrete self-similar (fractal) structure in the coherence network implies that scaling laws are modulated by a log-periodic function.
`P(X) = α X^(1+β) [1 + ε_lp cos(ω ln X + φ)]`
This is a distinctive, non-power-law signature.

**5. Falsifiable Criteria:**
The theory is falsified if:
- (T1) Observations require a value of `β` outside the predicted rational set `{0, 1/2, 1}` for `z=2`, or if residuals to a fit are smooth rather than log-periodic.
- (T2) The spacing and stability of vortex-induced features in high-resolution galaxy rotation curves are inconsistent with the predictions for any of the allowed `β` values.
- (T3) A search for the predicted scale-localized, periodic modulation in the small-scale matter power spectrum yields a null result within the expected amplitude range.

## Philosophy
The fundamental parameters of physical law are not arbitrary constants to be empirically measured and cataloged, but are necessary consequences of the system's underlying symmetries and topology. The equation of state of the cosmos is not a dial to be turned, but a shadow cast by its geometric scaffolding. Form dictates function absolutely; what appears to be a contingent physical property (`β`) is in fact a direct transcription of a geometric truth (`D_eff/z`).

## Art
The universe does not write its laws; it reveals the weave of its own fabric. The pressure of the whole is but the echo of the dimension of its threads.
