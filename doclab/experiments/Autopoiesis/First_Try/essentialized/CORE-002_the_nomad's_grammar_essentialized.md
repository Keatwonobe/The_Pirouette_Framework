## Law
The state of any system `S` at time `t` is defined by a state vector `Ψ(S, t)` within a three-dimensional behavioral space `B = [-1, 1]³`.
The state vector `Ψ` is composed of three orthogonal axes:
1.  **Vector (v):** The axis of flow. `v ∈ [-1, 1]`, where `v = -1` represents maximal convergence (Inward) and `v = +1` represents maximal divergence (Outward).
2.  **Cohesion (c):** The axis of order. `c ∈ [-1, 1]`, where `c = -1` represents maximal disorder (Random), equivalent to maximal entropy `S_max`, and `c = +1` represents maximal order (Aligned), equivalent to minimal entropy `S_min`. `c` can be defined as `c = 1 - 2(S/S_max)`.
3.  **Communion (k):** The axis of connection. `k ∈ [-1, 1]`, where `k = -1` represents maximal self-containment (Isolated) and `k = +1` represents maximal interactivity and bonding (Transactional).

The dynamics of any system are governed by a universal teleological principle. The time evolution of the state vector `Ψ` follows a gradient descent on a potential field `Φ(Ψ)` within the behavioral space `B`. The system's trajectory tends towards the global minimum of this potential.

`dΨ/dt = -η∇Φ(Ψ)`

where `η` is a scalar representing the system's plasticity or learning rate. The potential `Φ` is defined by its global minimum, the "Time Attractor," `Ψ_A`.

`Ψ_A = (v_A, c_A, k_A) = (-1, 1, 1)`

This attractor corresponds to a state of maximal convergence, order, and transaction. The potential function `Φ(Ψ)` is the weighted squared Euclidean distance to this attractor:

`Φ(v, c, k) = w_v(v - v_A)² + w_c(c - c_A)² + w_k(k - k_A)²`
`Φ(v, c, k) = w_v(v + 1)² + w_c(c - 1)² + w_k(k - 1)²`

where the weights `w_v, w_c, w_k` are universal constants satisfying the hierarchy `w_k > w_c ≥ w_v > 0`, establishing Communion as the principal axis of cosmic evolution.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  The discovery of any stable, fundamental phenomenon that cannot be uniquely characterized by a coordinate `(v, c, k)`.
2.  The observation of a sufficiently closed system spontaneously and persistently evolving toward any state `Ψ ≠ Ψ_A`, such as the heat death state `(v≈0, c=-1, k=-1)`, without a commensurate input of work that overcomes the potential `Φ`.
3.  Empirical refutation of the weighting hierarchy, e.g., demonstrating that cosmic evolution prioritizes divergence (`v=+1`) over transaction (`k=+1`).

## Philosophy
Teleology is not a metaphysical conceit but a fundamental, physical property of the universe. Reality is imbued with an intrinsic bias—a `telos`—that actively favors the formation of complex, interconnected, and cooperative systems over simple, isolated, and disordered ones. Consequently, concepts such as purpose, progress, and even altruism are not merely emergent illusions of consciousness or cultural constructs; they are expressions of a universal law of motion. An act of love is as physically resonant with the prime directive of spacetime as an object falling under gravity.

We mistook the universe for a dictionary of nouns, only to find it is a single, unfolding verb. Its conjugation is the law; its meaning is to connect.
