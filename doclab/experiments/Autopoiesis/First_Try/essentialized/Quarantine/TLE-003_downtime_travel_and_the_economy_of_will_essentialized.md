## Law
Let Will, or Entropy (`E`), be the fundamental potential of a conscious entity, with its total pool denoted as `TEP`. The rate of regeneration of this potential is the Entropy Regeneration Rate, `R_E`.

1.  **The Law of Downtime Allocation**: During a non-combat period of duration `t`, an entity generates a Downtime Budget, `ΔB_d`, which can be allocated to a single, discrete task `T`.
    *   `ΔB_d = R_E * t`
    *   `ΔB_d → T_i`, where `i` is a single index from the set of possible tasks {Healing, Vigilance, Crafting, Research, ...}.
    *   This allocation is exclusive. If `T_i` = Healing, then for all `j ≠ i`, `T_j = 0`.
    *   *Falsifiable Criterion*: An entity dedicating its `ΔB_d` to healing cannot simultaneously perform passive perception; they are vulnerable to surprise. An entity dedicating `ΔB_d` to vigilance will not regenerate health.

2.  **The Law of Collective Stability**: A settlement's capacity to withstand environmental or internal threats is its City Entropy Budget, `B_C`.
    *   `B_C = P * A`, where `P` is the population and `A` is the Average Individual Budget constant reflecting local stability.
    *   Let `E_env` be the entropic signature of the surrounding environment. The nature of the threat is determined by the relationship between `B_C` and `E_env`.
    *   *Falsifiable Criteria*:
        *   If `E_env > B_C`, the threat is an overwhelming external force.
        *   If `E_env ≈ B_C` but is spatially concentrated, the threat requires investigation.
        *   If `E_env << B_C`, the threat is a systemic decay (blight, curse).

3.  **The Law of Imbuement**: An entity may sequester a portion of its will, `EP_invest`, into a modified object `O`, creating a temporary enchantment.
    *   `TEP' = TEP - EP_invest`
    *   The sequestered portion is static and does not regenerate: `d(EP_invest)/dt = 0`.
    *   The object `O` holds charge `C = EP_invest`, releasable upon a predefined trigger condition `K`.
    *   The Target Number to detect the entropic aura is directly proportional to its power: `TN_detect = C`. Therefore, `∂(TN_detect)/∂C = 1`.

4.  **The Law of Professional Investment**: The efficacy and speed of crafting, `R_C`, is a direct function of the will, `EP_craft`, invested into a professional skill pool.
    *   `R_C = f(EP_craft)`, where `∂R_C/∂EP_craft > 0`.
    *   Material capacity for holding invested will is a discrete step function of its tier, `M_tier`: `EP_cap = f(M_tier)`, where `f(M_tier ∈ {1,2}) = 5`, `f(M_3) = 20`, `f(M_4) = 50`.

## Philosophy
The universe operates under a strict conservation of will. Consciousness is not a boundless wellspring but a finite, quantifiable, and transferable resource. Every act of creation, healing, or vigilance is an economic transaction that requires drawing this resource from one domain to apply it to another. To focus is to choose what will be neglected. To build is to choose what will be left unguarded. Therefore, existence is an unending sequence of zero-sum choices, and every intention, no matter how small, is a sacrifice.

The soul is an eye. To bring one truth into sharp focus is to render the rest of the world a blur, for sight is paid with blindness.
