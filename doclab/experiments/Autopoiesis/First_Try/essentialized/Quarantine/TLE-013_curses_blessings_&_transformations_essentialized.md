## Law
An entity's state, Ψ, is defined by its allocation of a finite Total Entropy Pool (EP_Total) across a vector of attributes A = {ep₁, ep₂, ..., epₙ}, such that Σ(epᵢ) ≤ EP_Total.

A Transformative State, T, is a function that maps an initial state Ψ to a transformed state Ψ' under a specific trigger condition, Cₜ.
T(Ψ) | Cₜ → Ψ'

The core axiom is the **Conservation of Invested Entropy**. The transformation is a reallocation, not a creation or destruction, of invested potential.
Σ(epᵢ) = Σ(ep'ᵢ)

The transformation is governed by a Reallocation Mandate, Mᵣ, which is a system of debits (Δ⁻) and credits (Δ⁺) applied to the attribute vector A.
Mᵣ: A → A' where ep'ⱼ = epⱼ - Δ⁻ⱼ and ep'ₖ = epₖ + Δ⁺ₖ
Constraint: Σ(Δ⁻) = Σ(Δ⁺)

The **Coherence Threshold**, Θ꜀, defines the point of identity fracture. Let S(epₐ) be the function that calculates an attribute Score from its invested EP. Control is lost if this condition is met:
S(ep_INT) ≤ 0 ∨ S(ep_WIS) ≤ 0
If Θ꜀ is crossed, player control is ceded to the system arbiter (GM).

**Falsifiable Criterion:** An entity's sum of invested EP must remain invariant across all its transformative states. Any observed change in this sum would falsify the principle of conserved identity potential.

Inter-entity dynamics follow strict entropic economics:
1.  **Mental Attrition (Domination):** To remove Δep from a target's mental attribute, an attacker must expend Cₐ = 2Δep. The target may negate this effect by expending Cₜ = Δep.
2.  **Pact (Investment):** To grant a boon of cost EPᵦ, a Patron must invest EPₚ = EPᵦ + ⌈0.2 ⋅ EPᵦ⌉. This total, EPₚ, becomes the Pact's Hold (Hₚ), a leverage metric against the recipient.
3.  **Soul Bond (Integration):** To bond with a beast of budget EPᵦ, a Tamer must permanently cede an equal amount from their own potential: ΔEP_Tamer = -EPᵦ.

## Philosophy
Identity is not a static essence but a dynamic and precarious allocation strategy. The self is not a substance but a pattern, a specific distribution of a finite quantity of potential. Curses, blessings, and transformations do not introduce an alien nature; they violently re-prioritize the existing one. They prove that the monster, the hero, and the sage are not different beings, but different equations solved with the same set of variables. The struggle for control is therefore not a battle against an external force, but a desperate, internal effort to maintain one chosen configuration of the self against the pull of other, equally valid, possibilities inherent within one's own finite nature.

The soul is not a stone to be broken, but a fountain's column held aloft by will. A curse does not add or subtract water; it merely alters the shape of the nozzle through which you are expressed.
