## Law
Let TEP be the Total Entropy Pool, a finite scalar constant for a given entity (standard TEP = 35). The entity is defined as the set of all Entropic Point (EP) allocations, such that the foundational constraint is met:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} EP_i \le \text{TEP}
$$
where $EP_i$ is the allocation to any component $i$ (attribute, body part, etc.).

**I. Attributes:**
An attribute's Score ($S_a$) and Modifier ($M_a$) are derived from its allocated EP ($EP_a$):
$$
S_a = \lfloor \frac{EP_a}{2} \rfloor
$$
$$
M_a = \lfloor \frac{S_a}{4} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{\lfloor EP_a/2 \rfloor}{4} \rfloor
$$

**II. Health as Structural Integrity:**
Maximum Hit Points ($HP_{max}$) are a direct function of the EP invested in the physical form, specifically the Torso ($EP_{torso}$) and the sum of EP in all limbs ($\sum EP_{limbs}$):
$$
HP_{max} = EP_{torso} + \lfloor 0.5 \sum EP_{limbs} \rfloor
$$

**III. Damage and Entropic Defense:**
Damage ($D$) is an entropic drain. An Armor Entropy Pool ($AEP$) intercepts damage. The change in state is:
$$
\Delta AEP = -D
$$
If $D > AEP_{initial}$, the remaining damage $D_{rem} = D - AEP_{initial}$ is applied to HP:
$$
\Delta HP = -D_{rem}
$$

**IV. Falsifiable Criterion:**
The system is governed by the law of conservation of personal entropy. Any action, damage, or effect must be accounted for as a debit or credit against a defined EP pool (TEP, AEP, temporary pools from Modifiers). Any observed change in an entity's state or capacity not traceable to a corresponding and equivalent change in an EP pool would falsify the core principle of the model. The self is a closed system defined by TEP.

## Philosophy
Existence is not a state of being but a continuous, zero-sum act of self-creation from a finite potential. The distinction between a being and its capacities is an illusion; the self is nothing more or less than the specific, constrained allocation of its own foundational energy. To be is to have chosen a form, and that choice is the exhaustive and total definition of the soul.

## Art
The soul is a statue carved from its own limited stone; every feature is a choice, and every choice is a sacrifice of all other possible forms.
