## Law
Let `M` be the act of Metaphysical Engineering to instantiate a creation `C`. The process is a function of an agent-creator `A` with a maximum Total Entropy Pool `TEP_max`, an Intelligence score `Int(A)`, and the creation's blueprint `B(C)`.

The process `M(C)` is defined by a three-step sequence, `S_1 → S_2 → S_3`:

1.  **Conceptualization (`S_1`):** Coherence of the blueprint `B(C)` must be established.
    `Check(Int(A), DC_C) ≥ 1` where `DC_C ≥ 30`.
    If the check fails, `M(C)` is aborted.

2.  **Investment (`S_2`):** A permanent sacrifice `ΔTEP` is made from the `TEP_max` of one or more contributing agents `{A_i}`. The state of each agent is irreversibly transformed:
    `TEP'_max(A_i) = TEP_max(A_i) - ΔTEP_i`
    The total investment must meet or exceed the creation's cost, `Cost(C)`:
    `Σ(ΔTEP_i) ≥ Cost(C)`
    The cost function is defined as:
    `Cost(C) =`
    - `50`, if `C` is a Skill
    - `100`, if `C` is a Feat
    - `TEP(C) * 5`, if `C` is an Item
    - `EB(C) * 10`, if `C` is a Creature, where `EB` is Entropic Budget
    - `≥ 1000`, if `C` is a Law of Magic

3.  **Resonance (`S_3`):** The system evaluates the interaction of `B(C)` with the set of existing universal laws `U`. This function `R(B(C), U)` yields the final instantiated creation `C'` and a non-empty set of unintended consequences, or Residue Events, `E_R`.
    `R(B(C), U) → (C', E_R)`

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The principle is falsified if any persistent creation `C` can be instantiated such that `Σ(ΔTEP_i) = 0`, violating the entropic cost of permanence.

## Philosophy
True creation is not an act of command *ex nihilo*, but an irreversible conversion of personal potential into objective reality. The universe enforces a conservation of being: for a new truth to exist in the world, a corresponding measure of the creator's own essence must be permanently extinguished. The act of creation is therefore an act of profound self-diminishment, forever binding the author to their work not by love or memory, but by the scar of their own sacrifice.

## Art
The creator is both the sculptor and the stone. Every new form carved into reality is a chip struck from their own soul.
