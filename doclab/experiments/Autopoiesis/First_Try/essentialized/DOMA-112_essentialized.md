## Law
The operational principle is derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), which states that a stable system follows a geodesic path that maximizes the action integral `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, where the Lagrangian is `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ` (Kinetic Coherence minus Potential Pressure). Systemic instability manifests as a deviation from this geodesic.

This deviation is quantified by the **Manifold Drift Vector**, `V_drift`. Let a system's state be defined by its dominant resonant signature, a vector `Ki` on the coherence manifold. `V_drift` is its temporal derivative:
`V_drift = d/dt Ki(t)`

`V_drift` measures the rate of change of the system's core identity, representing its "acceleration" away from the path of maximal coherence. Its magnitude `||V_drift||` quantifies the severity of this "Temporal Jitter."

The primary predictive metric is the **Coherence Inflection Index (CII)**, a dimensionless quantity that normalizes the system's internal instability against the ambient environmental pressure `Γ`:
`CII = ||V_drift|| / (1 + kΓ)`
where `k` is a domain-specific scaling constant. A high CII signifies significant *unforced* decoherence, indicating that the system's instability is endogenous and not merely a reaction to external forces.

The system's state and imminent trajectory are determined by falsifiable CII thresholds:
- **`CII < 0.3` (Stable):** The system is on or near its geodesic. `d/dt Ki(t) ≈ 0`. No state transition is predicted.
- **`CII ∈ [0.3, 0.6]` (Stressed):** The system is exhibiting significant drift. A state transition is probable.
- **`CII > 0.6` (Critical):** Geodesic deviation is critical. A major state transition (*Ki Morphogenesis*) is imminent.

## Philosophy
Catastrophe is not an event but a process. A system's future failure is not an instantaneous rupture caused by an external shock, but the final, visible symptom of a gradual, internal decay of coherence. The future is therefore encoded and observable in the present—not as a deterministic certainty, but as a measurable tension. By quantifying the subtle dissonance in a system's rhythm, one can prove that the most profound crises are born from the accumulation of seemingly insignificant instabilities. Foresight, then, is not the act of predicting an external blow, but the discipline of listening to the integrity of the thing that is about to be struck.

## Art
Before a bell shatters, its ring is corrupted. We mistake the final, violent crack for the cause of its breaking, but the true failure was the first dissonant whisper that betrayed the pure tone of its form.
