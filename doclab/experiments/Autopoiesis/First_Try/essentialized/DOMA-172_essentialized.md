## Law
The state of a system is defined by a Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, where `K_τ` represents its internal temporal coherence (kinetic) and `V_Γ` represents the external temporal pressure it must manage (potential). The system's ideal evolution, its geodesic `g`, is the path through its state space `q(t)` that maximizes the action integral `S[q(t)] = ∫ L_p(q, q̇, t) dt`. This path is the solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation `δS = 0`, which is `d/dt (∂𝓛_p/∂q̇) - ∂𝓛_p/∂q = 0`. This solution defines the system's "Geodesic Blueprint," `𝓛_p(g)`.

The core diagnostic is the Deviation Field, `Δ𝓛`, a scalar field defined as the absolute difference between the Lagrangian of the ideal geodesic state and the observed actual state:
`Δ𝓛(q, t) ≡ |𝓛_p(q_g, q̇_g, t) - 𝓛_p(q_actual, q̇_actual, t)|`

A fault locus is a falsifiable condition. It is any contiguous spacetime region where the Deviation Field's magnitude exceeds a statistically-defined Fault Threshold, `δ`:
`Fault Locus ≡ {(q, t) | Δ𝓛(q, t) > δ}`

The nature of the pathology is classified by the spatiotemporal signature of the `Δ𝓛` field:
1.  **Turbulence (Coherence Fever):** High-frequency components dominate the Fourier transform of `Δ𝓛(q,t)`. `∫∫ ℱ{Δ𝓛(q,t)} ω dω dq` is large.
2.  **Stagnation (Coherence Atrophy):** `Δ𝓛 > δ` where `𝓛_p(actual) → 0` while `𝓛_p(g) > C`, for some constant `C > δ`.
3.  **Decay (Coherence Erosion):** The spatially-averaged deviation exhibits a positive time derivative: `∂(⟨Δ𝓛⟩)/∂t > 0`.

## Philosophy
Pathology is not an entity to be found, but an absence to be measured. A flaw is not a presence, but a deviation; it is not a "thing" a system has, but a measure of what the system *is not*—namely, coherent with its own ideal form. Consequently, one does not need to learn the infinite language of failure. A perfect definition of health is the only prerequisite for a complete diagnosis of any and all disease. All possible modes of failure for a system are implicitly and completely defined by the geometry of its single, ideal path.

## Art
We do not diagnose the crystal by cataloging its every crack. We diagnose it by observing the shadow it casts against the light of its own perfect, unbroken form.
