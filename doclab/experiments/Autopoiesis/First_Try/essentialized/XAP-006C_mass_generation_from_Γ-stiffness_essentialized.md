## Law
The substrate Lagrangian sector governing mass generation is given by the Γ-field energy functional:
$
\mathcal{L}_\Gamma = \frac{1}{2}K_\Gamma(\partial_\tau \Gamma)^2 - V(\Gamma)
$
where $K_\Gamma$ is the temporal stiffness. Mass arises from the coupling of the order parameter modulus $|Ki|$ to this substrate via the interaction potential:
$
V_{\text{int}}(|Ki|,\Gamma) = \lambda_\Gamma\left(|Ki|^2-\xi\,\Gamma^2\right)^{\!2}
$
Minimizing this potential forces the equilibrium condition $|Ki|^2=\xi\,\Gamma^2$, defining a vacuum expectation value $v = \sqrt{\xi}\,\Gamma_0$. The masses of the scalar ($H$), vector gauge boson ($A_\mu$), and fermion ($\Psi$) excitations are then derived directly from this single substrate parameter $\Gamma_0$:
1.  **Scalar Mass ($m_H$):** Arises from oscillations of the $|Ki|$ modulus around $v$.
    $
    m_H^2 = 4\lambda_\Gamma\,v^2 = 4\lambda_\Gamma\,\xi\,\Gamma_0^2
    $
2.  **Vector Boson Mass ($m_A$):** Arises from the kinetic term of the order parameter $|D_\mu Ki|^2 = |(\partial_\mu + i g_N A_\mu)Ki|^2$.
    $
    m_A^2 = g_N^2\,v^2 = g_N^2\,\xi\,\Gamma_0^2
    $
3.  **Fermion Mass ($m_f$):** Arises from a direct torsion coupling term in the fermionic Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_f = \bar\Psi\, (i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - y_\Gamma \Gamma)\Psi$.
    $
    m_f = y_\Gamma\,\Gamma_0
    $

**Core Principles & Falsifiable Criteria:**
- **Mass Origin:** All particle masses are proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the temporal substrate field, $\Gamma_0$. Mass is not a fundamental property but an emergent effect of substrate stiffness.
- **Invariant Ratio:** The model predicts a fixed, non-arbitrary ratio between the scalar and vector boson masses, governed by the geometric coupling constants:
    $
    \frac{m_A}{m_H} = \frac{g_N}{2\sqrt{\lambda_\Gamma}}
    $
- **Falsifiable Prediction:** Since particle masses are proportional to $\Gamma_0$, and $\Gamma_0$ may vary with ambient coherence (e.g., temperature), the theory predicts small, environment-dependent shifts in measured particle masses, testable in high-precision experiments.

## Philosophy
The single most profound implication is the re-ontologizing of mass itself. Mass is not an intrinsic property bestowed upon particles by an ad-hoc, space-filling field. Instead, mass is an emergent measure of the resistance of the temporal substrate to deformation. Inertia—the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion—is literally the elasticity of time itself pushing back. The universe is not a passive stage on which massive objects move; rather, an object’s mass is the degree to which it is dynamically coupled to, and constrained by, the active, resilient fabric of its own unfolding.

## Art
A particle is a dancer; its mass is not its weight, but the floor’s stubborn refusal to yield beneath its step.
