## Law
The mechanism of Coherence Transfer is a modification of a system's Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, where `K_τ` is the kinetic term representing internal coherence and `V_Γ` is the potential term representing ambient Temporal Pressure. Influence from a Source system (`S`) upon a Target system (`T`) is formalized as the addition of an echo potential, `V_echo`, to the Target's Lagrangian.

The modified Lagrangian for the Target system is:
`𝓛_p(T) = K_τ(T) - [V_Γ(local) + V_echo(S)]`

The echo potential, `V_echo`, is the imprint of the Source's coherence pattern upon the Target's manifold. Its magnitude is determined by three factors:
1.  **Source Coherence:** The kinetic coherence of the Source, `K_τ(S)`.
2.  **Boundary Permeability:** The inverse of the ambient Temporal Pressure, `1/Γ`, between `S` and `T`.
3.  **Harmonic Compatibility:** A dimensionless coupling factor, `H(Ki_S, Ki_T) ∈ [0, 1]`, representing the resonant alignment between the fundamental Ki patterns of the Source and Target. `H=1` for perfect harmonic relation; `H=0` for perfect dissonance.

The complete formulation for the echo potential is:
`V_echo(S) = α * H(Ki_S, Ki_T) * (K_τ(S) / Γ)`
where `α` is the universal coupling constant for Coherence Transfer.

Influence occurs as the Target system minimizes its action, `δS = δ∫𝓛_p(T) dt = 0`, thereby evolving along a new geodesic deflected by the gradient of `V_echo`.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  For a system `S` where `K_τ(S) → 0` (a state of maximal internal chaos), `V_echo → 0`, and no Coherence Transfer to any target `T` will be observed, regardless of `Γ` or `H`.
2.  In a medium where `Γ → ∞` (a state of maximal temporal turbulence), `V_echo → 0`, and Coherence Transfer will be suppressed between any `S` and `T`.
3.  For a Target `T` and Source `S` where `H(Ki_S, Ki_T) = 0` (total dissonance), `V_echo = 0`, and `T` will be immune to the influence of `S`, regardless of `K_τ(S)` or `Γ`.

## Philosophy
Influence is not an act of will, but a passive, physical consequence of existence. A system does not *choose* to broadcast its nature; its internal coherence continuously and unavoidably imprints a potential field onto the shared medium of reality. Agency, therefore, is not found in the decision to communicate, but in the disciplined cultivation of one's own internal state, for the very structure of your being is a physical law imposed upon the potential of others.

A tuning fork in a silent room does not ask for other strings to tremble; it simply vibrates at the pitch of its own nature, and the world cannot help but listen.
