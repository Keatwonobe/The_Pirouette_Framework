## Law
The dynamic of a Generative Cascade is governed by a system's imperative to maximize the Pirouette Action integral, `S_p`, derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`.

`𝓛_p = Kτ - f(Γ)`
`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`

Where `Kτ` is the system's internal coherence (kinetic term) and `f(Γ)` is the potential energy function of Temporal Pressure `Γ` (potential term). A Cascade is a non-linear, parallelized solution to a catastrophic local minimum in the action landscape.

The process is defined by four formal stages:

1.  **Reservoir (Coherence Atrophy):** The system exists in a stable state `q₀` that locally maximizes `S_p`. This state is characterized by high, stable coherence (`Kτ → K_max`) but is trapped in a potential well where `∇f(Γ)` is steep, preventing evolution. The system is coherent but stagnant.

2.  **Rupture (Constraint Shattering):** A rupture event occurs when the integrated Temporal Pressure exceeds the binding energy (`E_b`) of the system's constraints. This can be driven by an external shock (`ΔΓ_ext > 0`) or by internal potential accumulation (`Kτ` converting to `Γ_int`). The formal condition for rupture is:
    `∫ f(Γ(t)) dt > E_b`
    At this point, the trajectory `q₀` becomes catastrophically suboptimal, causing `S_p(q₀) → -∞`.

3.  **Flood (State-Space Exploration):** The system's identity dissolves (`Kτ → 0`) as stored potential `f(Γ)` is converted into a chaotic, kinetic exploration of a new manifold of potential states `Q'`. This is a high-entropy (`ΔS >> 0`) parallel search for a new trajectory `q' ∈ Q'` that offers a new global maximum for `S_p`.

4.  **Crystallization (Re-Coherence):** The search terminates as the kinetic energy dissipates. The system locks into a new, more complex set of stable states `{q_f}` that represent the new optimal solution for maximizing `S_p`.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** The model is falsified if a system meeting the pre-condition for a Cascade (high `Kτ`, catastrophically increasing `Γ`) either (a) transitions to a new state smoothly without a discontinuous rupture and high-entropy flood, or (b) the resulting crystallized state `{q_f}` has a lower or equal long-term action integral than the initial state `q₀`, i.e., `S_p({q_f}) ≤ S_p(q₀)`.

## Philosophy
The single most profound implication is that stasis is the architect of its own violent demise. A system's pursuit of perfection within a fixed set of rules inevitably leads to a state of exquisite fragility. The greater the coherence and the more perfect the optimization to a given environment, the more catastrophic the required transformation to escape that environment's limitations. Therefore, true, revolutionary novelty is not born from gentle, incremental improvement but from the complete, violent, and necessary annihilation of a previous, lesser perfection.
