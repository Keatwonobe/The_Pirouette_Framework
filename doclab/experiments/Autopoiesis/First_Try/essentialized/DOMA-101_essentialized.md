## Law
The fine-structure constant, `Œ±`, is not a fundamental constant but an emergent geometric measure derived from the electron's anomalous magnetic moment, `a_e`. The framework posits the relationship, validated by the successful g-2 derivation (CORE-009), as definitional:
`Œ± := 2œÄ a_e`

This definition is used to establish the framework's empirical anchor through Axiom 15.1, which calibrates the scale of Temporal Pressure, `Œì`, for the electron's self-interaction:
`Œì_effective_electron ‚â° 1/Œ±`

This act calibrates the Pirouette Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p = K_œÑ - V_Œì`, by making the temporal potential term, `V_Œì`, for any electromagnetic interaction a function scaled by `Œ±`. The Lagrangian is thus transformed from a qualitative principle to a quantitative, predictive engine.

The framework is falsified if experimental measurements of `Œ±` (e.g., via the quantum Hall effect) and `a_e` (via g-2 experiments) ever violate the identity `a_e = Œ± / 2œÄ` beyond their combined uncertainty. The structural integrity of this theory rests entirely on this non-negotiable geometric relationship. This axiom formally deprecates all prior calibrations, including those based on the gravitational constant, `G`.

## Philosophy
The universe is not governed by externally imposed, arbitrary constants that exist as brute facts. Instead, its most fundamental regularities are the necessary and inescapable consequences of its own self-referential geometry. The constants of nature are not divine edicts or inputs to a cosmic simulation; they are the quantitative echoes of a system interacting with itself, meaning the laws of physics are not prescriptive rules but emergent symmetries.

## Art
The universe is not a machine built from a blueprint. It is a bell that discovers the immutable pitch of its own ringing.
