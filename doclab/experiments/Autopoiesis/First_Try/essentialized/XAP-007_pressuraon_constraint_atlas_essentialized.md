## Law
The pressuron sector is defined by a background coherence density \(\Gamma_0\) and a self-coupling constant \(\lambda_\Gamma\). All derived observables are functions of these, the lepton coupling \(\kappa\), and a dimensionless parameter \(\epsilon\).

The mass of the composite pressuron excitation is:
\[
m_p = \Gamma_0\sqrt{2\lambda_\Gamma}
\]
This pressuron mediates a short-range interaction between Standard Model leptons, described by an effective Yukawa potential with range \(R_\Gamma \sim m_p^{-1}\):
\[
V_\Gamma(r) = \epsilon^2 \frac{e^{-m_p r}}{r}
\]
The coupling \(\kappa\) governs the strength of all phenomenological probes. Cross sections, decay rates, and energy-loss rates scale as:
\[
\sigma_{\Gamma\Gamma} \propto \kappa^2 \qquad \dot\epsilon_\Gamma \propto \kappa^2
\]
Anomalous magnetic moments of leptons scale identically:
\[
\Delta a_l^{(\Gamma)} \propto \kappa^2
\]
The cosmological constant \(\Lambda\) is not fundamental, but is identified with the residual energy density of the pressuron field, an effective stiffness parameter:
\[
\rho_\Lambda \equiv \Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}} \propto \Gamma_{\mathrm{stiff}}^2
\]
Consistency of the framework across vastly different energy scales—from collider (\(s/m_p^4\)) to stellar (\(T^4\)) to cosmological (\(H_0\))—is maintained by a renormalization group flow for the coupling constant, bounded by \(|\eta|<0.1\):
\[
\frac{d\kappa}{d\ln\Lambda} = \eta\,\kappa
\]
The central, falsifiable Law is that a single parameter set \((m_p, \kappa, \epsilon)\) in the fiducial window \(m_p \in [10,30]\) MeV, \(\kappa \in [10^{-4}, 10^{-2}]\), and interaction range \(\in [1, 100]\) μm must simultaneously satisfy all existing constraints from colliders, fifth-force experiments, stellar cooling, and cosmic expansion history.

## Philosophy
The cosmological constant—the engine of cosmic destiny and the ultimate large-scale property of the universe—is not a fundamental, immutable constant of nature. It is demoted to an emergent, residual stress in a dynamic, microscopic quantum field. This reframes the "why is it so small?" problem into a materials science problem of a cosmic superfluid. The universe's fate is therefore not a pre-ordained geometric parameter, but the collective, low-energy behavior of a substance whose properties are directly accessible to and falsifiable by tabletop and collider experiments.

## Art
The void is not empty; it is a pane of glass, whose slow, inexorable cracking under its own internal stress propels the galaxies apart, and whose integrity can be tested by the tap of a single particle.
