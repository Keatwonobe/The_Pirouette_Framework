## Law
The theory is defined by the quantization of a complex scalar field $C(x)$ (coherence) and a real scalar field $\Gamma(x)$ (temporal pressure) on a globally hyperbolic spacetime with metric $g^{\mu\nu}$. The classical action is $S = \int d^4x\sqrt{-g} \mathcal{L}$, with Lagrangian density:
$$
\mathcal{L} = g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu C^* \partial_\nu C + \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\Gamma \partial_\nu\Gamma - V(|C|^2,\Gamma)
$$
Canonical quantization promotes the fields to operators satisfying the equal-time commutation relations (with $\Pi_C = \partial\mathcal{L}/\partial(\partial_0 C)$, etc.):
$$
[\hat C(t,\mathbf x),\hat\Pi_C(t,\mathbf y)] = i\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf x-\mathbf y) \\
[\hat\Gamma(t,\mathbf x),\hat\Pi_\Gamma(t,\mathbf y)] = i\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf x-\mathbf y)
$$
The quanta are the "coheron" ($C$) and the "pressuron" ($\Gamma$). The Feynman propagators $\Delta_F(x,x')$ are the time-ordered two-point correlators $\langle 0| T\{\hat\phi(x)\hat\phi(x')\} |0\rangle$, which solve the covariant Green's function equations for free fields with mass $m$:
$$
(\Box_x + m^2)\Delta_F(x,x') = -\frac{i\delta^{(4)}(x-x')}{\sqrt{-g}}
$$
In Minkowski momentum space, $\Delta_F(p) = \frac{i}{p^2-m^2+i\epsilon}$. Interactions are derived from the potential $V$. For an interaction term $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = -g|C|^2\Gamma$, the corresponding Feynman vertex rule is $-ig$.

This formalism yields falsifiable predictions. If kinematics allow ($m_\Gamma > 2m_C$), the theory predicts the decay of a pressuron into a coheron-anticoheron pair, $\Gamma \to C\bar{C}$, with a tree-level decay width:
$$
\Gamma_{\Gamma\to C\bar C} = \frac{g^2}{8\pi m_\Gamma}\sqrt{1-\frac{4m_C^2}{m_\Gamma^2}}
$$
Observation or non-observation of such a decay channel provides a direct constraint on the model's free parameters ($g, m_\Gamma, m_C$).

## Philosophy
The quantization of a field that measures temporal pressure, $\Gamma(x)$, does not entail the quantization of the time coordinate, $t$. The theory's deepest philosophical implication is the rigorous separation between a physical, dynamic quantity *on* spacetime and the abstract coordinate system of spacetime itself. We can have a universe where the "thickness" or local rate of temporal passage is a granular, probabilistic quantum phenomenon—an active participant in interactions—while the underlying dimension of time remains a smooth, continuous parameter of evolution. The map is not the territory, and a property of the territory is not the territory itself.

## Art
We did not shatter the clock. We discovered that the rhythm of its ticking is played by a choir of ghosts.
