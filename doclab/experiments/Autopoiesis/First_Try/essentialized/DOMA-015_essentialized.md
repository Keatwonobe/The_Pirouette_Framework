## Law
The Pirouette Module Definition (`.pmd`) establishes a formal system for authoring knowledge artifacts. Let a module M be a composite object defined as:
M := (B, N)
Where B is the Blueprint, a set of key-value pairs compliant with YAML syntax, representing the module's formal position within a coherence manifold (e.g., `id`, `parents`, `dependencies`). N is the Narrative, a sequence of characters compliant with Markdown syntax, representing the human-intelligible expression of the module's concept.

The authoring of M is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which states that the optimal creative path is one that extremizes the action S = ‚à´ùìõ_p dt. The governing dynamic is described by the Pirouette Lagrangian:
ùìõ_p = KœÑ - V_Œì

Here:
-   KœÑ represents the Temporal Coherence, a functional of N, KœÑ[N(t)], quantifying the semantic clarity, logical integrity, and expressive force of the narrative over the authoring time t. It is the kinetic term of meaning.
-   V_Œì represents the Temporal Pressure, a potential function V_Œì(B, N), quantifying the combined constraints of machine-parsability (syntactic rigidity of B) and human cognitive load (structural clarity of N). It is the potential energy cost of form.

The `.pmd` format is the physical realization of the geodesic that minimizes this action. A transformation operator, the Forge (F), acts upon a completed module M to produce a bifurcated output:
F: M ‚Üí (C, S)
Where C is the Codex (PDF), an archival rendering preserving KœÑ for human cognition, and S is the Signal (JSON), an instrumental data structure isolating the formal graph defined by B for machine computation.

**Falsifiable Criterion:** Given a constant authoring time and cognitive effort, a system employing the unified M := (B, N) structure will produce artifacts with a higher measurable coherence (defined as a function of lower machine parsing errors for S and higher semantic density scores for C) than a system where the formal structure and the narrative expression are authored and maintained as separate, unlinked entities.

## Philosophy
The most profound philosophical implication is the refutation of the classic dichotomy between form and freedom. The Law posits that a rigorous, machine-intelligible structure is not a prison for meaning but a necessary condition for its potent expression. Coherence is not an emergent property of pure, unstructured thought; it is an achievement of thought disciplining itself against a formal, falsifiable grammar. The act of defining the riverbed is indistinguishable from the act of creating the river's force. Therefore, true intellectual freedom is not the absence of constraints but the masterful selection of the constraints that best amplify one's signal against the noise of chaos.

## Art
The logic of the machine is not a cage for the poem, but the hard, crystalline lattice on which the poem learns to grow.
