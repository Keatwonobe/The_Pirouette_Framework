## Law
The system is a self-gravitating, irrotational superfluid described by its density `n(x,t)` and velocity potential `θ(x,t)`. The velocity field is `v = (1/m_H)∇θ`. Its evolution is governed by:

1.  **Continuity Equation:**
    `∂_t n + ∇ ⋅ (n v) = 0`

2.  **Euler-Poisson System with Quantum Stress and Surface Tension:**
    `∂_t v + (v ⋅ ∇)v = -∇h - ∇Φ + (1/m_H)∇Q + (σ/ρ)κ_s n̂_⊥`
    Where:
    -   `h` is the specific enthalpy, derived from a pressure `p=P(n)`.
    -   `Φ` is the gravitational potential, given by the Poisson equation: `∇²Φ = 4πG(ρ_b + m_H n)`.
    -   `Q = -(ħ²/2m_H) (∇²√n)/√n` is the quantum pressure potential.
    -   `(σ/ρ)κ_s n̂_⊥` is the surface tension force, with `σ` the surface tension coefficient, `κ_s` the mean curvature of an iso-density surface `n=const`, and `n̂_⊥` the unit normal to that surface.

3.  **Vortex Quantization Condition:**
    The circulation `Γ` around any closed loop is quantized: `Γ = ∮ v ⋅ dl = ℓ (2πħ/m_H)` for `ℓ ∈ ℤ`.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
-   **Cored Profiles:** For a stationary, spherical halo (`∂_t=0`, `v=0`), the model predicts a finite central density `ρ_0` and a characteristic core radius `r_c` where `∇p = -ρ∇Φ` is balanced by the quantum pressure `Q`, precluding a central cusp. Absence of such cores falsifies the model.
-   **Critical Rotation:** A halo rotating with angular velocity `Ω` will remain vortex-free until `Ω` exceeds a critical value `Ω_c ≈ (ħ/m_H r_c²) ln(r_c/ξ)`, where `ξ` is the healing length. Observation of vortices below `Ω_c` or their absence above it falsifies the model.
-   **Vortex Lattice Signatures:** For `Ω > Ω_c`, a triangular lattice of vortices with spacing `d_v ∝ √(c_s/Ω)` must form, producing predictable non-circular velocity components in integral field spectroscopy and a peak in the power spectrum of stellar streams at wavenumber `k ≈ 1/d_v`.
-   **Merger Dynamics:** The merger of two halos must exhibit an effective drag force quantifiable by `(σ/m)_eff` which is a non-gravitational function of the initial parameters `(v_rel, n, σ, ξ)`.

## Philosophy
The universe's gravitational scaffolding is not a particulate dust, but a coherent quantum fluid. On galactic scales, fundamental constants (ħ, G) and emergent properties (surface tension, healing length) conspire to sculpt cosmic structure, implying that the most massive, diffuse objects we observe are macroscopic quantum states, blurring the line between the microphysical and the astronomical.

## Art
The galaxy is a dewdrop on the void, its surface tension a shield against nothingness, its core softened by the ghost of quantum uncertainty. To spin is to braid the vacuum into a lattice of silent whirlpools.
