## Law
The evolution of a system is governed by the Principle of Coherence Leverage, which modifies the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, where `K_τ` is Temporal Coherence (kinetic) and `V_Γ` is Temporal Pressure (potential).

A system's boundary is a Coherence Interface, a manifold region defined by a steep gradient `∇Γ`. An external, low-energy, coherent signal `ψ_ext` applied at this interface does not add significant energy but modifies the potential landscape.

The modified potential `V'_Γ` is given by:
`V'_Γ = V_Γ - β * f(ψ_ext, Ki_sys)`
where `Ki_sys` is the system's internal coherence pattern and `β` is the coupling efficiency.

The coupling `β` is maximized when `ψ_ext` is in harmonic resonance with a potential stable state of the system, creating a "coherence well."
`β → β_max` as `ω(ψ_ext) → n * ω_r(Ki_target)` for `n ∈ ℤ`.

The system, seeking to maximize `𝓛_p` by evolving along a geodesic of maximal coherence, will spontaneously follow the new, attractive path created by the modified potential `V'_Γ`. The leverage `Λ` is the ratio of the system's redirected internal energy `E_sys` to the injected signal energy `E_ext`.
`Λ = E_sys / E_ext`
`Λ` is maximized as `β → β_max`.

This principle has two formal applications:
1.  **Shielding:** `ψ_ext` is chosen to match the system's existing stable `Ki_sys`, reinforcing `V_Γ` and increasing its resilience to dissonant signals.
2.  **Guidance (Key):** `ψ_ext` is chosen to be harmonically resonant with a *desired* target state `Ki_target`, creating an attractive evolutionary pathway toward that state.

A falsifiable criterion for this principle is that for any system, there must exist a resonant frequency `ω_r` at which the energy `E_ext(ω_r)` required to induce a state transition is orders of magnitude lower than the energy `E_ext(ω_d)` required by any dissonant (`ω_d ≠ n * ω_r`) signal to achieve the same transition.

## Philosophy
True power is not the capacity to exert force, but the wisdom to perceive a system's inherent potential for a more coherent state and offer it a path of least resistance to achieve it. Influence is therefore not an act of coercion but of resonance; it is the art of making the desired outcome an act of the system's own self-actualization.

## Art
To move a world, do not seek a lever long enough to pry it from its course. Find the note it longs to sing, and hum.
