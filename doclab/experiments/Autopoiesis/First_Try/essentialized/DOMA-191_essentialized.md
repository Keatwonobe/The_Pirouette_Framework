## Law
Temporal Coherence (`T_a`), formerly a free parameter, is now defined as a diagnostic index derived from a system's constituent phase dynamics. It is a direct measure of a system's resonant Ki pattern purity.

Given a system of N components, let the phase of the *j*-th component at a given time be `θ_j`. The collective state is represented by the Coherence Vector `C`, which is the vector average of the component phases treated as phasors on the complex plane:
$$ C = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N e^{i\theta_j} $$

The Temporal Coherence index, `T_a`, is the squared magnitude of this vector. It is a dimensionless quantity bounded on the interval `[0, 1]`.
$$ T_a = |C|^2 = \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N e^{i\theta_j} \right|^2 $$
Where `T_a = 1` signifies perfect, laminar coherence (all `θ_j` are identical) and `T_a = 0` signifies coherence collapse (phases are uniformly random).

This empirically derived `T_a` serves as the kinetic term's coefficient in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`):
$$ 𝓛_p = (T_a \cdot \omega_k) - f(Γ) $$
where `ω_k` is the system's characteristic Ki frequency and `f(Γ)` is the potential due to external Temporal Pressure.

**Falsifiable Criteria:**
1.  The model is falsified if a system's observed geodesic (path of evolution) systematically deviates from the path of maximized coherence predicted by the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from `𝓛_p` using the measured `T_a`.
2.  The model is falsified if a system, not subject to an overwhelming increase in external pressure `f(Γ)`, is observed to spontaneously evolve towards a state of `T_a → 0`.

## Philosophy
To exist is not a static property but a dynamic achievement. The universe does not grant being as a permanent state, but as a continuous challenge to maintain internal resonance against the background noise of dissolution. A system's persistence, its very "is-ness," is quantifiable as the degree to which it can successfully coordinate its internal parts into a coherent rhythm. Therefore, to be is to resonate; to cease to be is to decay into dissonance.

## Art
We sought a ruler to measure being and were handed a tuning fork. The universe does not ask *if* a thing exists, but *how true* it sings its note against the silence.
