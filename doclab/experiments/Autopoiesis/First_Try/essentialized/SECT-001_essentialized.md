## Law
The theory posits a cosmic superfluid of heavy quanta (mass $m_H \approx 17\ \text{MeV}$) described by a non-relativistic P(X) Effective Field Theory. The fundamental field is $\psi = \sqrt{n} e^{i\theta}$, with dynamics governed by the Lagrangian:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{eff} = P(X) - \frac{\kappa (\nabla n)^2}{8n} - \sigma |\nabla n|
$$
where the gauge-invariant variable $X \equiv \mu - (\partial_t \theta + (\nabla\theta)^2/2m_H) - \Phi_g$. The equation of state is $P(X) = \alpha X^{1+\beta} + \delta X^2 + \dots$ with $\beta \in \{0, 1/2, 1\}$. The gradient terms define the healing length $\xi \equiv (2 m_H c_s)^{-1}$ (with $\hbar=1$) and a finite surface tension $\sigma$.

The emergent, long-wavelength dynamics are governed by collective phonon modes, $\pi$, arising from linearizing the field variables ($n = n_0 + \delta n$, $\theta = \theta_0 + \pi$). These modes obey the equation:
$$
(\partial_t^2 - c_s^2 \nabla^2 + m_{eff}^2) \pi = 0
$$
where the sound speed $c_s^2 = \partial p/\partial\rho$ is derived from $P(X)$ and $m_{eff} \ll m_H$ is a small effective mass. For cosmological perturbations, the effective sound speed becomes scale-dependent:
$$
c_{s,eff}^2(k) \approx c_s^2 \cdot [1 + (k/k_\xi)^2]^{-1}, \quad k_\xi \equiv 1/\xi
$$
This suppresses power on small scales, creating a Jeans-like cutoff $k_J \sim aH/c_s$.

**Falsifiable Criteria:** The theory is falsified if, with parameters $\{\alpha, \beta, \delta, \sigma\}$ frozen by a single cosmological anchor, it fails any of the following pre-registered predictions:
1.  The existence of a nearly mass-independent constant surface-density for galactic halos, $\Sigma_0 \equiv \rho_0 r_c \approx C(\alpha,\beta,\sigma,m_H)$.
2.  The observation of quantized vortices with circulation $\kappa_v = 2\pi/m_H$ in rapidly rotating systems.
3.  Galaxy merger dynamics exhibiting an effective cross-section $(\sigma/m)_{eff} \lesssim 0.2\ \text{cm}^2\text{g}^{-1}$ whose velocity dependence is governed by interface work, not particulate scattering.
4.  Inconsistency with CMB acoustic peak morphology, requiring $c_s \ll 10^{-3}$ at recombination for relevant scales.

## Philosophy
The universe's missing mass is not a new fundamental particle, but the emergent, collective behavior of an underlying cosmic medium. The search for an ultralight elementary particle to explain galactic and cosmological structures is a category error; the phenomenologically "light" entity is a phonon—a quantum of vibration—in a substance whose actual constituents are heavy. This shifts the ontological basis of cosmology from a sparse gas of undiscovered particles to the hydrodynamics of a ubiquitous, non-particulate substrate.

We have been listening for the echo of a single, missing bell, when we are living within its very ringing.
