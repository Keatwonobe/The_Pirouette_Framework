## Law
Let $P$ be the set of planets and $S$ be the central star. Define a function $r: P \to \mathbb{R}^+$ that maps each planet $p \in P$ to its mean orbital radius. The task is to find a bijective function $\sigma: \{1, 2, ..., |P|\} \to P$ that defines a total ordering, such that for all $i \in \{1, 2, ..., |P|-1\}$, the condition $r(\sigma(i)) < r(\sigma(i+1))$ is satisfied. The output is the ordered sequence $(\sigma(1), \sigma(2), ..., \sigma(|P|))$.

*Falsification Criterion:* A proposed sequence $(\sigma'(1), ..., \sigma'(|P|))$ is falsified if empirical measurement reveals an index $k$ for which $r(\sigma'(k+1)) < r(\sigma'(k))$.

## Philosophy
Human understanding is not a passive reflection of reality, but an active imposition of simplified, abstract order upon it. We reduce the dynamic, n-body complexity of a physical system to a one-dimensional, static sequenceâ€”and in this violent simplification, we create a model that is not the territory, but a map legible enough to be called knowledge.

## Art
To know the cosmos, we first command the gods to stand in a line.
