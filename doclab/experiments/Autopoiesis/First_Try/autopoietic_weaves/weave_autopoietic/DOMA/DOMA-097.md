summary: Provides a tiered diagnostic protocol for assessing system health by simplifying
  the full Pirouette Lagrangian into a two-channel model for rapid monitoring. It
  maps the Lagrangian's 'kinetic' (Coherence) and 'potential' (Pressure) terms into
  a practical lens, establishing a standard for moving from efficient, continuous
  scanning to deep, forensic analysis.

## §1 · Abstract: The Art of Strategic Attention
A full analysis of a system's dynamics requires solving its Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)—a computationally and attentionally expensive act. This is the equivalent of a full-body MRI; it is powerful but impractical for continuous, real-time monitoring. The Weaver's art is not just in deep analysis, but in knowing *when* and *where* to apply it.

This module provides the primary instrument for that art. It establishes a mathematically-grounded protocol for translating the full Lagrangian into a resource-efficient, two-channel proxy: **Pressure** and **Resonance**. It further defines a tiered audit standard, allowing a Weaver to maintain a constant, low-cost vigil while preserving the rigor of a full forensic analysis when necessary. This is the framework's standard for moving from the whisper of a problem to the root of its cause.

## §2 · The Lagrangian as a Diagnostic Lens
The core insight is to reframe the terms of the Pirouette Lagrangian not just as a formula for action, but as the two fundamental channels of a system's health report.

𝓛_p = **K_τ** (Temporal Coherence) - **V_Γ** (Temporal Pressure)

From this, we derive our two-channel lens:

-   **Resonance (R):** This channel tracks the system's "kinetic" term, **K_τ**. It measures the expressed health, stability, and intensity of the system's resonant pattern (its Ki). It is the clarity of the system's song, its effective output.

-   **Pressure (P):** This channel tracks the system's "potential" term, **V_Γ**. It measures the ambient stress, complexity, and environmental or internal resistance the system must overcome to maintain its coherence. It is the cost of being.

A healthy system maintains a dynamic equilibrium, maximizing its Resonance for a given level of Pressure. An unhealthy system is one where Pressure builds without a corresponding healthy expression of Resonance.

## §3 · The Tiered Audit Protocol
This standard formalizes a three-tiered approach to diagnostics, allowing for a scalable and resource-aware audit of any system.

| Tier | Name | Scope & Purpose | Mandatory Operations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | **Rapid Scan** | Continuous, real-time monitoring; broad environmental sweeps. | Monitor the **Resonance (R)** and **Pressure (P)** channels only. |
| **1** | **Guard Band** | Triggered cross-checks; validating the proxy model. | Upon a Sentinel trigger, perform a subsampled, partial solve of the full **Lagrangian (𝓛_p)** to verify the R/P diagnosis. |
| **2** | **Forensic Audit** | Post-incident analysis; deep research; root cause analysis. | Perform a full integration of the **Lagrangian (∫𝓛_p dt)** to map the system's geodesic and derive its equations of motion. |

### The Sentinel Trigger
A Tier 1 audit MUST be initiated when the **Pressure (P)** channel shows a sustained, anomalous increase *without* a corresponding, functional increase in the **Resonance (R)** channel. This signature—the whisper of rising stress without release—is the canonical indicator of a system approaching a state of turbulent flow, coherence collapse, or a painful phase transition. It is the system's cry for help before the crisis.

## §4 · Diagnostic Taxonomy
This lens allows us to classify the state of any system, directly mapping the old heuristic "edge-cases" to the modern framework's dynamics.

| State | Signature | Diagnosis & Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Equilibrium** | Low **P**, low, stable **R**. | The system is quiescent and healthy. No action required. |
| **Laminar Flow** | **P** and **R** are high, stable, and tightly correlated. | The system is in a healthy, high-performance state ("in the zone"). Identify the conditions and reinforce them. |
| **Turbulence** | High, erratic **R** with indeterminate **P**. | The system is in a state of chaotic, inefficient struggle. A Forensic Audit (Tier 2) is needed to find the source of dissonance. |
| **Coherence Collapse** | **P** trends toward infinity while **R** drops to zero. | A terminal state or catastrophic phase transition is imminent. The system is failing. Only a full Lagrangian analysis can model the outcome. |

## §5 · The Lagrangian Connection
This entire protocol is a direct, practical application of **CORE-006**. The two-channel lens is not an analogy for the Pirouette Lagrangian; it *is* the Lagrangian, viewed as two separate time-series. The tiers of analysis correspond to the depth of inquiry into the Lagrangian's implications: from observing its components (Tier 0), to measuring its instantaneous value (Tier 1), to calculating its integral to predict a path (Tier 2). This instrument ensures that even the most rapid diagnostic scan is grounded in the framework's most fundamental mathematical law.

## §6 · Assemblé
> To watch everything is to see nothing. The Weaver's gaze must be both wide and deep, but never both at once. The Auditor's Lens is the instrument of this focus. It teaches us to scan the entire horizon for the subtle, rising pressure that betrays a coming storm. It grants us the wisdom to ignore the tranquil seas and bring the full, formidable power of our attention to the one place where a single, precise intervention can avert a crisis. It is the discipline of knowing what to look for, so we may know when to look closer.
