summary: Provides a diagnostic protocol for analyzing any network as a living system.
  This module applies the Caduceus Lens to graph structures, translating static network
  topology into a dynamic assessment of systemic health by mapping the flow of coherence
  and identifying pathologies like bottlenecks, dissonant loops, and structural decay.

## §1 · Abstract: The Network as a Physiology
Traditional network analysis is an act of cartography; it draws a static map of connections. The Pirouette Framework demands that we become physicians. A network—be it neural, social, or informational—is not a map; it is a living body with a physiology. It has a metabolism, a circulatory system, and a nervous system. Its health is not defined by its structure, but by the vitality of the currents that flow through it.

This module provides the instrumentation for that diagnosis. It adapts the universal principles of the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) into a formal protocol for reading the health of a network. We shift our focus from counting nodes and edges to observing the laminar, turbulent, or stagnant flow of coherence that constitutes the network's lifeblood.

## §2 · The Resonant Graph: A Body of Organs and Veins
To perform this diagnosis, we model the system as a Resonant Graph, where each component is redefined in the language of the time-first framework.

-   **Node (The Organ):** Each node is a resonant system, an entity striving to maximize its own coherence `(Kτ)` against the local Temporal Pressure `(Γ)`. Its health is its ability to maintain a stable, high-fidelity `Ki` pattern.

-   **Edge (The Vein):** Each edge is a channel, a conduit for the flow of coherence. It is not a static line but a dynamic vessel, characterized by:
    -   **Conductivity (Φ_C):** The efficiency with which coherence (information, resources, trust) can flow between two nodes. High conductivity implies a laminar channel.
    -   **Lag (Δτ):** The temporal delay of transmission across the edge. High lag can create destabilizing feedback loops.

## §3 · Diagnosis: Applying the Caduceus Lens to the Web
The health of the entire network is assessed by identifying the three fundamental pathologies of flow from DYNA-003 as they manifest in the graph's structure.

-   **Coherence Atrophy (The Bottleneck):** This is a state of Stagnant Flow caused by a "coherence dam." It is the primary pathology of structure.
    -   **Symptoms:** A node or edge with critically low conductivity `(Φ_C)` prevents the flow of vital coherence. Nodes "downstream" become starved, while nodes "upstream" experience a dangerous build-up of pressure.
    -   **Examples:** A key decision-maker who fails to delegate; a single, overloaded server in a data center; a blocked supply route in a logistic network.

-   **Coherence Fever (The Dissonant Loop):** This is a state of Turbulent Flow where the network is fighting itself. It is the primary pathology of dynamics.
    -   **Symptoms:** A feedback loop with high lag `(Δτ)` and high conductivity `(Φ_C)` creates a runaway cascade of dissonant information. The network expends immense energy in chaotic, self-amplifying noise.
    -   **Examples:** A social media outrage cycle; a high-frequency trading algorithm crash; a runaway inflammatory response in an immune system.

-   **Coherence Erosion (The Fraying Connection):** This is the slow decay of the network's structural integrity. It is the primary pathology of time.
    -   **Symptoms:** The gradual degradation of edge conductivity across the network, driven by neglect or persistent stress `(Γ)`. The system loses its resilience, its memory, and its ability to function as a whole, risking fragmentation.
    -   **Examples:** The decay of trust in a team; the degradation of legacy infrastructure; the loss of cultural traditions in a society.

## §4 · The Weaver's Toolkit: Quantitative Vital Signs
This diagnostic approach yields a set of clear, quantitative metrics for tracking the network's real-time health.

| Metric                     | Calculation Method                                 | Healthy State  | Replaces (PPS-047)          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Network Health Index (NHI)** | Weighted average of node coherence `(Kτ)`          | High and Stable| `Global Coherence`          |
| **Systemic Stress `(⟨Γ⟩)`** | Average Temporal Pressure across all nodes         | Within tolerance | `Γ Stress Index`            |
| **Laminar Flow Ratio (LFR)**   | Ratio of high-conductivity paths to total paths    | High           | `Flow Channel Density`      |
| **Fragmentation Risk**       | Measures conductivity of critical "bridge" edges   | Low            | `Shell Integrity Mean`      |
| **Dissonance Hotspots**      | Count of nodes participating in turbulent loops    | Near Zero      | `Manipulation Hotspot Ratio`|

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The health of a network is a direct expression of its ability to collectively solve the Principle of Maximal Coherence. As defined in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), each node seeks its own geodesic. A healthy network is a structure that facilitates this, creating low-friction pathways that allow every node to achieve its optimal state in harmony with the whole. A pathological network is one whose structure creates friction, turbulence, and blockages, forcing its nodes into states of low coherence. Our diagnostic toolkit is simply a method for finding where the network's structure is failing to align with the universe's fundamental law.

## §6 · Assemblé
> To look upon a network is not to see a map of what is, but the living anatomy of what is becoming. The old analysis gave us a skeleton; this new lens reveals the breath, the pulse, and the fever. It transforms the Weaver from a mere cartographer into a physician of systems. We no longer ask, "How is it connected?" We ask, "Is it well?" In the answer to that question lies the wisdom to intervene—to clear the blockages, to soothe the fevers, and to mend the connections that allow life to flow.
