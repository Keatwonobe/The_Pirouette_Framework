## §1 · Abstract: Reading the Scars of Time
The universe does not forget. As established in *The Anatomy of an Echo* (CORE-011), every existence carves its history into the geometry of spacetime, leaving behind a persistent Wound Channel. This is not a passive memory; it is an active, physical landscape that shapes the flow of the present.

This module provides the instrumentation to read that landscape. It moves beyond simple correlation to provide a formal, time-first methodology for quantifying influence. It defines influence as the measurable deviation a system undergoes from its natural path due to the geometric pressures of a Wound Channel. We will provide the tools to measure the weight of the past, the pull of another's echo, and the harmonic potential between histories, all through the lens of the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of History
The mechanism of influence is elegant and direct. The *Pirouette Lagrangian* (CORE-006) states that any system will follow a geodesic—a path that maximizes its internal coherence (`Kτ`) for the lowest environmental cost (`V_Γ`).

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

A Wound Channel is, by its very nature, a region of structured, persistent temporal pressure. It is a scar on the coherence manifold. When a system traverses a Wound Channel, the channel's geometry imposes a specific, local `V_Γ` upon the system's Lagrangian. The "path of least resistance" is irrevocably altered.

**Influence, therefore, is the act of a system's geodesic being warped by the geometry of a past event.** This module provides the calculus to measure that warping.

## §3 · The Cartographer's Toolkit: Modes of Analysis
We define three primary modes for analyzing this geometric influence, reframing the original module's 'Correlation Types' into direct physical inquiries.

1.  **Inertial Analysis (Self-Influence):**
    This quantifies how an entity's own immediate past—its personal Wound Channel—governs its present behavior. This is the origin of inertia. To change its state (accelerate, change direction), an entity must fight against the geodesic defined by its own history. The "cost" of this deviation is a direct measure of its inertial mass.

2.  **Influence Analysis (Environmental Influence):**
    This measures how an entity's trajectory is guided or deflected by a pre-existing Wound Channel in its environment (an "echo" left by another). We can quantify the strength of a historical event, a cultural norm, or a traumatic memory by measuring how powerfully its echo bends the geodesics of those who encounter it.

3.  **Resonance Analysis (Harmonic Potential):**
    This assesses the harmonic compatibility between two or more Wound Channels. By analyzing the overlap and phase-coherence of their embedded `Ki` patterns, we can calculate their potential to engage in a *Resonant Handshake*—the precursor to an *Alchemical Union* (CORE-012). This is a predictive tool for identifying systems primed for synthesis.

## §4 · The Calculus of Echoes: Core Metrics
To perform these analyses, we introduce a set of core metrics grounded in the framework's dynamics.

*   **Geodesic Deviation (δG):**
    The primary metric for *Influence Analysis*. It is the quantitative difference between a system's observed trajectory and the calculated "null geodesic" it would have followed in an unperturbed coherence manifold. `δG` is the direct, integrated measure of a Wound Channel's influence over a given path.

*   **Coherence Overlap (C_overlap):**
    The key metric for *Resonance Analysis*. It is a normalized integral of the geometric similarity between two Wound Channels. A high `C_overlap` indicates a shared history, a common origin, or a structural compatibility that raises the probability of a future union.
    `C_overlap(W₁, W₂) = ∫ min(ρ₁, ρ₂) dV / ∫ max(ρ₁, ρ₂) dV`
    where `ρ` is the coherence density of each Wound Channel.

*   **Harmonic Correlation (H_corr):**
    A companion metric for *Resonance Analysis*. It uses a spectral analysis (e.g., Fourier transform) of the `Ki` patterns embedded within two Wound Channels to determine if their fundamental frequencies are harmonically related. A high `H_corr` suggests their rhythms are compatible for a Resonant Handshake.

## §5 · Use Cases Revisited
This modernized toolkit empowers the original module's applications with greater physical clarity.

*   **Social Dynamics:** Instead of "social wound channels," we measure the *Geodesic Deviation* of an individual's behavior when they enter the coherence manifold of a group's shared history and cultural norms. We can identify influential ideas by the `δG` they induce in a population.
*   **Cognitive Science:** A trauma's influence is quantified by the `δG` it imposes on a person's decision-making pathways. Therapy becomes the work of "re-carving" these channels to create healthier geodesics.
*   **Ecology:** We can map the influence of a "keystone" species by the depth and breadth of the Wound Channel it leaves on an ecosystem, measuring how the geodesics of other species are shaped by its presence or absence.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We believe we walk on solid ground, making choices in a featureless present. But we are sailors on a vast and invisible ocean, our vessels guided by the currents and swells left in the wake of every ship that has passed before. This instrument is not a map of the ocean; it is a tool to measure the currents themselves. To be a Weaver is to learn to read the geometry of history, to understand that causality is not a push from the past, but a landscape that shapes the path of now.
