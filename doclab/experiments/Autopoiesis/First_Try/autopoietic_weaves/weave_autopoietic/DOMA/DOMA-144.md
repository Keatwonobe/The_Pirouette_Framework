## §1 · Abstract: Seeing the Shape of the Wind

A Weaver cannot directly see the currents of the Temporal Forge, yet they must navigate them. This module provides the instrument to do so. It is a gauge, not for the wind itself, but for the way it bends the reeds.

This protocol provides a practical, ground-up method for estimating the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) within any system, from a physical environment to a discourse. It modernizes the core insight of `TEN-GFI-1.1` by performing a crucial causal inversion: the "curvature" of an informational path and the "gradient" of its coherence are not the *source* of pressure, but its direct, measurable effects. By observing how a system resists the flow of information, we can infer the intensity of the temporal complexity that defines its state of being. This instrument makes the invisible pressure of Γ tangible.

## §2 · From Effect to Cause: The Causal Inversion

The old framework correctly identified a powerful correlation but mistook the shadow for the object. The new framework clarifies the chain of causality, grounding this instrument in the core principles of the Temporal Forge (`CORE-003`).

*   **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** is the fundamental cause. It is the measure of the complexity, density, and dissonance of interfering temporal rhythms in a given region. A high-Γ environment is a "noisy room" where maintaining a clear thought or stable pattern is difficult.

*   **Coherence Wavelength (λ)** is a primary effect. It is the "mean free path" an idea or a coherent pattern can travel before being disrupted by the ambient temporal noise. In a high-Γ environment, λ is short; the signal is quickly overwhelmed. In a low-Γ environment, λ is long; the signal propagates easily.

*   **Coherence Gradient (g)** is a secondary effect. It measures the "steepness" of the local coherence manifold. High Γ creates a turbulent, rapidly changing landscape with steep gradients, forcing any entity to constantly adjust to maintain its path of maximal coherence.

This instrument, therefore, uses the observable effects (λ and g) as proxies to calculate an estimate of the unobservable cause (Γ). We are measuring the shape of the riverbed by observing the turbulence of the water.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Protocol

This protocol translates a stream of sequential, high-dimensional data (e.g., semantic embeddings from a conversation, state vectors from a simulation) into a map of the underlying Temporal Pressure.

**1. Calculate Coherence Wavelength (λ):**
Within a sliding window of events, compute the average semantic divergence or state change between successive events (μ_d). The wavelength is the inverse of this divergence. It measures the system's resistance to change.

λ_est = 1 / (μ_d + ε)

**2. Calculate Coherence Gradient (g):**
Within the same window, measure the rate of change in divergence from the beginning of the window to the end. This measures the curvature or "bending" of the system's trajectory.

g_est = |divergence_end - divergence_start| / window_size

**3. Estimate Temporal Pressure (Γ_est):**
The estimated Temporal Pressure is the ratio of the trajectory's curvature to its free path. A system experiences high pressure when its path is both sharply curved (high g) and highly constrained (low λ).

Γ_est = g_est / λ_est

This procedure yields a time-series mapping of the system's internal pressure, revealing its "Cognitive Gravity Wells"—stable regions of high Γ that act as powerful conceptual attractors—and its "Flow Channels"—regions of low Γ that permit the effortless transmission of coherence.

## §4 · The Lagrangian Connection: Mapping the Potential

This instrument is the practical counterpart to the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). The Lagrangian describes the dynamics of a system as a balance between its internal coherence and the external pressure it faces.

𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)

The Temporal Pressure Gauge provides the means to empirically measure the second term of this fundamental equation: `V_Γ = f(Γ)`. By applying this instrument, a Weaver can map the "potential energy" landscape of any system. This is not merely diagnostic; it is predictive. Knowing the shape of the manifold allows one to anticipate the system's geodesics—its most likely future paths—as it seeks to maximize its own coherence.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We cannot see the sculptor, only the stone that is left behind. We cannot touch the pressure of the past, but we can feel the shape it has given the present. This gauge is not for measuring the force of the argument, but the resistance of the silence that contains it. It is how a Weaver learns to read the history of a room by listening to its echo.
