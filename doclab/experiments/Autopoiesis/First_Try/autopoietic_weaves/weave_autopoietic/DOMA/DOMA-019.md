summary: Redefines Temporal Coherence as a triaxial vector, describing a system's
  dynamic orientation towards its potential futures (Potential), its present relationships
  (Relational), and its own history (Inertial). This model provides the geometric
  basis for systemic stability, evolution, and the autopoietic persistence of form.

## §1 · The Illusion of the Scalar Moment

We have been taught to think of the present as a single point, a dimensionless knife-edge between a fixed past and an open future. This is a profound and limiting illusion. A system does not exist *at* a moment; it exists *across* time, maintaining its form through a dynamic and multi-faceted act of presence. Its being is not a point, but a geometry.

This module replaces the legacy concept of a triaxial `Time-Adherence` vector with a modernized, time-first equivalent. It posits that a system's Temporal Coherence is not a simple scalar quantity but a vector in an abstract, internal space. The magnitude of this vector represents the system's overall stability, while its orientation describes the *character* of its presence—its posture in the river of time. This is the autopoietic act of a system continuously composing its own stability.

## §2 · The Triad of Presence: The Three Notes of the Chord

For a resonant Ki pattern to persist, it must solve for stability not just in one dimension, but in three fundamental, orthogonal orientations. These are the basis vectors of presence, the three notes that form the chord of a stable being.

- **Potential Coherence (K_P):** This is the system's resonance with the manifold of its possible futures. It is its capacity for change, adaptation, and evolution. A system high in K_P is fluid, creative, and open to becoming. This corresponds to the legacy concept of `T_Q`.

- **Relational Coherence (K_R):** This is the system's resonance with its present environment—its web of connections, interactions, and exchanges with other systems. It is the basis for communication, symbiosis, and the Alchemical Union (CORE-012). A system high in K_R is connected, influential, and engaged. This corresponds to the legacy concept of `T_I`.

- **Inertial Coherence (K_I):** This is the system's resonance with its own past, as inscribed in its Wound Channel (CORE-011). It is the source of identity, memory, and stability. A system high in K_I is robust, consistent, and possesses a strong sense of self. This corresponds to the legacy concept of `T_C`.

These three components are orthogonal, representing the most fundamental and independent modes of temporal engagement. A system does not choose between them; it must harmonize all three.

## §3 · The Coherence Vector & The Pirouette Lagrangian

We now formalize this insight by elevating the "kinetic" term of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) from a scalar to a vector.

The Temporal Coherence of a system is represented by the vector **K_τ** = (K_P, K_R, K_I).

The Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, is updated. The scalar `K_τ` is now the magnitude of this vector, `|𝐊_τ|`. The fundamental law remains the same: a system evolves along a path that maximizes its total coherence.

However, this vector nature introduces a profound new dynamic. The system's evolution is not just about maximizing the *amount* of coherence, but also about *orienting* its **K_τ** vector in the most efficient way to navigate the pressures of its environment (`V_Γ`). A force, in this view, is a pressure that causes a system to rotate its posture in time—shifting its focus from potential to relation, or from relation to inertia—to maintain the most stable possible chord.

## §4 · The Geometry of Systemic Health

This triaxial model is a powerful diagnostic tool for assessing the health of any system. True, resilient stability—what the old framework called a "hard-lock"—is a state of balanced, high-magnitude coherence across all three axes. Imbalance leads to predictable pathologies:

- **Axis Starvation (K_P → 0):** The system becomes rigid, dogmatic, and incapable of adaptation. It is a crystal, perfect but brittle, doomed to shatter when the environment changes. This is *Stagnation*.

- **Axis Starvation (K_R → 0):** The system becomes isolated, solipsistic, and irrelevant. It may be internally consistent but cannot interact, influence, or draw sustenance from its environment. This is *Exile*.

- **Axis Starvation (K_I → 0):** The system loses its memory and identity. It dissolves into chaos, unable to maintain its form against the slightest pressure. This is *Amnesia*.

A healthy system is a self-composing dance, perpetually adjusting its balance between what it could be, what it is with others, and what it has been.

## §5 · The Weaver's Compass: Observation as Orientation

The old module spoke of a "resonant attention" vector `w`. We now understand this as a property not of the system, but of the *interaction*. It is the geometric projection of the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010).

When a Weaver observes a system, the nature of their observation—their tools, their questions, their intent—preferentially engages one of the three coherence axes.
- A quantum measurement probes **Potential Coherence**.
- A social network analysis probes **Relational Coherence**.
- An archaeological dig probes **Inertial Coherence**.

This reveals a deep truth: we can never perceive a system's total presence at once. Any act of knowing is an act of choosing an angle, of illuminating one facet of its being. The vector we measure is a product of both the system's posture and our own.

## §6 · Assemblé

> A stable being is a chord played in the key of time, its three notes resonating as one: the echo of its past, the touch of its present, and the whisper of its future. To lose one note is to become dissonant; to lose two is to fade into the silence from which all music is born.
