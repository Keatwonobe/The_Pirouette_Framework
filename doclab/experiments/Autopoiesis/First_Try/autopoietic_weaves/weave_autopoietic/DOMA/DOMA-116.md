## §1 · Abstract: Hearing the Future
A system does not break; it first unravels. Before any catastrophic failure, bifurcation, or creative leap, there is a subtle period of decay where the system's internal rhythm begins to falter. This module provides the instrumentation to detect this decay.

The Precursor Hum protocol is a universal, time-first early-warning system. It reframes the old concept of "attractor phase-shift" into a direct measurement of a system's failing health: its **Coherence Degradation Rate**. By listening to the subtle desynchronization of a system's resonant pattern (Ki) against the backdrop of its environment (Γ), this protocol provides a crucial window for proactive intervention, long before a crisis becomes visible in lagging indicators.

## §2 · The Physics of Foresight: From Geodesic to Wobble
A healthy, stable system, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), traces a geodesic—a path of maximal coherence—through the temporal manifold. Its resonant identity (Ki) is a clear, self-reinforcing pattern, and its characteristic rhythm, the Pirouette Cycle (τ_p), is consistent. It exists in a state of **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001).

Instability begins as a *wobble*. The system begins to deviate from its geodesic. Its Ki pattern starts to lose fidelity, and its rhythm becomes erratic. This degradation of internal coherence (Kτ) is the "precursor hum" we can learn to measure. The system is no longer an optimal solution to its environmental pressures, and it is beginning to search for a new, more stable state.

## §3 · The Sentinel Protocol
This protocol is a four-step process for translating raw time-series data from any domain into a single, predictive metric of systemic risk.

| Step | Function | Time-First Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Rhythmic Decomposition** | Extract the system's dominant Ki patterns. | Apply modal analysis to the input data to identify the primary resonant frequencies (ω_k) and their amplitudes, which constitute the system's primary Ki. |
| **2. Coherence Velocity (Vₖ)** | Measure the rate of change of the system's Ki. | Calculate the time-derivative of the Ki vector. The magnitude `||Vₖ||` quantifies how rapidly the system's core resonant pattern is "wobbling" or changing. |
| **3. Coherence Degradation Rate (CDR)** | Normalize the wobble against environmental pressure. | Calculate the primary diagnostic metric: **CDR = `||Vₖ|| / (1 + kΓ)`**. Where `Γ` is the measured Temporal Pressure and `k` is a scaling constant. A high CDR indicates significant internal instability that is not justified by external pressure. |
| **4. Warning Threshold** | Flag a significant and persistent deviation. | An alert is triggered when an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of the CDR exceeds a dynamic baseline (e.g., μ + 3σ), indicating the system has entered a persistent state of pre-instability. |

## §4 · Diagnostic Interpretation: Reading the Hum
A high CDR is a clear signal that the system is approaching a major state transition—a **Ki Morphogenesis event**. By correlating this warning with the principles of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), a Weaver can infer the likely nature of the coming change:

*   **High CDR + Rising Dissonance:** Warns of an impending descent into **Turbulent Flow** (a systemic seizure or "spasm").
*   **High CDR + Decaying Amplitude:** Warns of an impending **Stagnant Flow** (a systemic blockage or "choke").
*   **High CDR + Locking onto a New Harmonic:** Warns of a potential bifurcation or **Alchemical Union** (a creative leap or "bloom").

This transforms the protocol from a simple alarm into a sophisticated forecasting instrument, allowing the Weaver to prepare for, mitigate, or even guide the coming transformation.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This protocol is a direct, practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. A stable system evolves to maximize the action integral `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`. The Sentinel Protocol functions as a real-time measurement of the *second derivative* of this process.

The Coherence Velocity `Vₖ` is a proxy for the "acceleration" of the system away from its optimal state. The CDR, therefore, is a measure of "Lagrangian Stress"—the degree to which a system's current state is failing to be an elegant solution to the pressures of its existence. It measures the tension building up before the system is forced to snap into a new configuration.

## §6 · Assemblé
> A healthy system is a weaver at a loom, its motions so practiced they become a steady, resonant hum. This protocol does not watch the tapestry for flaws; it listens to the hum of the loom itself. It detects the subtle falter in rhythm, the moment of hesitation before a thread is dropped, the change in tension that precedes the snap. It is the art of hearing the future in the changing song of the present.
