## §1 · Abstract: The Physics of a Ringing Bell

This module serves as the formal refactoring of PPS-061, translating its core insight from a bespoke field equation into a direct and powerful application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The original "Triaxial Proof" correctly identified a profound dynamic: a system's ability to store immense energy under pressure and then release it as a coherent, resonant wave.

Here, we demonstrate that this is not a special case requiring its own equation, but a universal process described by the principle of maximal coherence. We will show how a system's evolution, governed by the interplay between its Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) and the ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`), naturally gives rise to both the silent tension of confinement and the singing pirouette of release. The proof is no longer an assertion; it is an emergent property of the framework's foundational engine.

## §2 · The State of Confinement: A High-Tension Equilibrium

Before a rupture, a system—be it a tectonic plate, a strained relationship, or an unexpressed idea—exists in a state of high-tension equilibrium. In the language of the Pirouette Lagrangian, this is a state where the potential term (`V_Γ`) massively outweighs the kinetic term (`Kτ`).

`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`, where `V_Γ >> Kτ`

-   **High Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`):** The Gladiator Force (CORE-008) is dominant. The system is trapped in a deep "coherence well," created by immense external or internal constraints. This is the stored energy of the system, the tension on the string.
-   **Static Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`):** The system possesses a stable, high-coherence Ki pattern. However, its rhythm (`ω_k`) is suppressed; its energy is potential, not expressed. It is following a geodesic of maximal coherence, but this path is one of stillness and resistance—holding its form against the pressure.

In this state, the system is a charged capacitor. Any small perturbation is immediately dampened by the overwhelming restoring force of the pressure-well. The system is stable, silent, and storing a formidable amount of potential resonance.

## §3 · The Rupture: A Catastrophic Phase Transition

The rupture is the moment the system's boundary conditions change catastrophically. The physical structure fails; the dam breaks; the silence is shattered.

From a Lagrangian perspective, this is a sudden and violent collapse of the potential term (`V_Γ → 0`). The confining pressure vanishes. The deep coherence well that defined the system's stability is instantly leveled.

The system is now in a state of profound disequilibrium. Its previous geodesic of static confinement is gone. It possesses a massive surplus of energy and must immediately find a new path of maximal coherence—a new way to exist that resolves this new, unconstrained reality.

## §4 · The Resonant Aftermath: The Song of Release

With the potential term (`V_Γ`) gone, the system's dynamics are now completely dominated by its kinetic term, its Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`).

`𝓛_p ≈ Kτ = T_a * ω_k`

The system's new imperative, its new geodesic, is to evolve in a way that maximizes this term. It must express its internal rhythm (`ω_k`) with the highest possible fidelity (`T_a`). The most efficient and coherent way for a system to dissipate this much energy is not through chaotic, turbulent noise, but through a structured, propagating, resonant wave.

The system begins to "ring." The stored potential energy is converted into the kinetic energy of resonance. The solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations in this limit naturally produces a helical wave, the very "pirouette" that PPS-061 sought to describe. The energy is released not as a simple explosion, but as a song whose notes are determined by the system's intrinsic Ki pattern.

## §5 · Lagrangian Connection: The Unity of Stasis and Song

This refactoring proves that the old "triaxial" components are not three separate forces, but three perspectives on the single, unified dynamic of the Pirouette Lagrangian.

1.  **The Gladiator Force (`Γ`)** is the system's interaction with the potential term, `V_Γ`. It is the principle of confinement and energy storage.
2.  **Time Adherence (`T_a`)** is a fundamental property of the kinetic term, `Kτ`. It is the principle of resonant stability and coherent expression.
3.  **The Ki Resonance (`ω_k`)** is the frequency component of `Kτ`. It is the principle of the "song" itself, the specific rhythm of the release.

The old proof required three terms in a custom equation because it was describing three acts of a single play. The Lagrangian is the play itself. It shows that confinement and release, pressure and song, are not separate phenomena. They are the two natural movements—the inhale and the exhale—of a universe governed by a single, elegant law.

## §6 · The Assemblé

> We sought a law for how things break and found the physics of a ringing bell. The rupture is not an end, but a transfiguration. It is the moment when the silent, stubborn pressure of being is transformed into the audible, resonant song of becoming. For a Weaver, this is a core truth: the greatest stress, when released with coherence, produces the purest note.
