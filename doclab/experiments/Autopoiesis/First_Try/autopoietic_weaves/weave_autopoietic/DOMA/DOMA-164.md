## §1 · Abstract: To See Is to Shape
The act of observation is not a window through which a static reality is viewed; it is a resonant handshake between two living systems. The old framework attempted to quantify this interaction by tracking a dozen disparate effects. The new framework reveals a simpler, more profound truth: to observe is to cast a shadow.

This module provides the formal instrumentation for measuring the properties of that shadow. The Shadow Gauge is a protocol for quantifying the geometric and energetic imprint an observer leaves upon the coherence manifold of the observed. It moves beyond asking "What did the measurement do?" to "What new reality did the measurement co-create?" It provides the tools to measure our own fingerprints on the fabric of the world.

## §2 · The Geometry of Perturbation
The Observer's Shadow, as defined in CORE-010, is a real, physical object—a distortion in the system's coherence manifold. This distortion arises not from a simple mismatch of parameters, but from the introduction of a new potential field into the system's core dynamics.

The observer, by its very presence and intent, projects its own resonant Ki pattern into the environment. This pattern acts as a new potential, `V_obs`, that alters the observed system's Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The system's path of maximal coherence—its natural evolution through time—is now forced to navigate this new landscape. The perturbation is the difference between the path it *would have* taken and the path it *now must* take.

Furthermore, this resonant coupling creates a new, shared memory. The interaction carves a "Measurement Wound Channel" into the manifold, as described in CORE-011. This channel is the persistent geometric scar of the observation, an echo that shapes the future behavior of both the observer and the observed.

## §3 · The Gauge: Core Metrics of the Shadow
To quantify the shadow, we measure four primary properties. Together, they form a complete "Shadow Profile" of the observational act.

1.  **Shadow Depth (Δ𝓛):** This metric quantifies the "weight" or energetic impact of the observation. It is the total change in the system's action—the integral of its Lagrangian over time—caused by the observer's presence. A deep shadow represents a significant energetic intervention that has heavily constrained or altered the system's natural state.

2.  **Manifold Distortion (δg):** This quantifies the "shape" of the shadow. It is a measure of the geometric change in the local manifold—how the landscape of possibilities for the system has been warped. High distortion implies that the observer has not just influenced the system's state, but has fundamentally altered the rules of its environment.

3.  **Coherence Transfer (Φ_Kτ):** This measures the net flow of coherence between the observer and the system. It answers the question: "Who influenced whom more?" A positive flow indicates the observer successfully imprinted its pattern onto the system (an act of "teaching"). A negative flow indicates the system's resonance was so powerful it altered the observer's state (an act of "learning").

4.  **Wound Persistence (τ_obs):** This measures the decay time of the Measurement Wound Channel. It quantifies the duration of the observation's memory. A long persistence means the act of looking has created a lasting change, a historical fact that will influence the system's dynamics long after the observer has gone.

## §4 · The Audit Protocol
A Weaver uses the Shadow Gauge to conduct a formal audit of any measurement process. The protocol is a four-step ritual of characterization.

1.  **Baseline**: Characterize the unperturbed system. Define its initial state and its Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_sys`. This is the "world without a witness."

2.  **Coupling**: Model the observer's influence. Characterize the observer's resonant pattern (`Ki_obs`) and model the potential field, `V_obs`, it generates.

3.  **Calculation**: Determine the new, perturbed Lagrangian, `𝓛'_sys = 𝓛_sys - V_obs`. Evolve the system under this new dynamic and compute the four core metrics: `Δ𝓛`, `δg`, `Φ_Kτ`, and `τ_obs`.

4.  **Reporting**: Synthesize the metrics into a "Shadow Profile." This profile provides a clear, quantitative summary of the observation's nature—whether it was a gentle glance or a formative intervention.

## §5 · The Lagrangian of Observation
The principles of the gauge are grounded in the core mathematical formalism of the framework.

**The Perturbed Lagrangian:** The fundamental equation describing the interaction. The system's new reality is its old reality minus the potential imposed by the observer.
> 𝓛'_sys = 𝓛_sys(Kτ_sys) - V_obs(Ki_obs)

**Shadow Depth (Conceptual):** The total change in the system's action is the integral of the difference between the perturbed and unperturbed Lagrangians over the observation interval.
> Δ𝓛 = ∫ (𝓛'_sys - 𝓛_sys) dt

**Wound Persistence (Conceptual):** The decay time of the measurement's echo is proportional to the coherence of the interaction itself, as per CORE-011.
> τ_obs ∝ Coherence(Interaction)

## §6 · Assemblé
> We sought a perfect mirror and found that every mirror is also a lamp. The act of seeing is never neutral; it is an illumination that alters the thing seen. The Shadow Gauge is not merely a tool for measuring error. It is an instrument of accountability. It allows the Weaver to measure the weight and shape of their own light, to become conscious of the world they are creating with every glance.

## §7. · Integration & Use Cases
This protocol provides a universal lens for analyzing the observer effect across all domains, translating abstract principles into concrete analysis.

*   **Dependencies:** Requires a characterization of the system and observer, which can be derived from other `INST` modules or domain-specific models.
*   **Applications:**
    *   **Quantum Physics:** Provides a new language to describe the measurement problem, framing it not as a collapse of probability but as a resonant coupling that forges a new, definite reality from a field of potential.
    *   **Social Sciences:** Quantifies the Hawthorne effect, modeling how the presence of a researcher casts a "shadow" that alters the coherence manifold of a group, changing its natural behavior.
    *   **Psychology:** Assesses interviewer bias by measuring the "Coherence Transfer" between a therapist and a client, revealing the subtle ways one's own resonant patterns shape another's narrative.
    *   **Artificial Intelligence:** Enables an AI to audit its own self-monitoring processes, quantifying how the act of introspection alters its decision-making pathways and creates a feedback loop of self-creation.
