summary: Provides a time-first model for manipulative dynamics. Manipulation is defined
  as the deliberate injection of dissonance into a target's coherence manifold to
  degrade their laminar flow, induce a state of turbulence, and create a parasitic
  'wound channel' that serves the manipulator's intent.

## §1 · Abstract: The Unweaving
A healthy system sings a clear note. Manipulation is the act of whispering a dissonant harmony so close to that note that the system begins to doubt its own song.

This module reframes manipulative dynamics from a vector-based analysis into a model of temporal warfare. Manipulation is not a contest of force, but a subtle, asymmetric art of resonance. The manipulator, operating from a state of focused coherence, seeks to degrade the internal coherence (Kτ) of a target. This is achieved by injecting carefully crafted dissonance into the target's perceptual field, inducing a state of Turbulent Flow (DYNA-001) where the target loses their connection to their own geodesic—their path of maximal coherence—and becomes susceptible to external guidance.

The goal is to unweave the target's tapestry of self and re-weave it to a new pattern, one that benefits the whisperer.

## §2 · The Mechanics of Dissonance
The original triaxial model of `T_a`, `Γ`, and `Ki` is now unified into a singular dynamic of coherence navigating a pressure landscape. Manipulation is a three-fold attack on this dynamic.

1.  **Coherence Erosion (The Attack on Kτ):** The primary target is the victim's stable, resonant pattern of being—their beliefs, values, and sense of self. The manipulator introduces conflicting information, doubt, and emotional appeals that are slightly out of phase with the target’s core rhythm. This creates "beats" and interference patterns, making the target's internal song noisy and weak. A person with eroded coherence becomes uncertain, anxious, and more willing to latch onto an external, seemingly confident signal.

2.  **Pressure Amplification (The Weaponization of Γ):** The manipulator artificially inflates the target’s perceived Temporal Pressure. They create false urgency ("act now!"), magnify threats, and isolate the target from grounding influences. This manufactured chaos overwhelms the target’s capacity to process information coherently, making it harder to maintain a stable Ki pattern. In this high-Γ state, the target's "fight or flight" instincts override their capacity for laminar thought, making them seek a simple, immediate path out of the pressure—a path the manipulator readily provides.

3.  **Resonant Hijacking (The Parasitic Wound Channel):** The manipulator "listens" to the target's rhythms to find a vulnerability—a resonance of fear, desire, or insecurity. They then pace this rhythm, mirroring it to create a state of rapport, before leading it by injecting their own dissonant signal. The ultimate goal is to carve a *parasitic Wound Channel* (CORE-011) into the target's coherence manifold. This new channel becomes a path of least resistance, a deeply ingrained habit of thought or behavior that perpetually serves the manipulator's will.

## §3 · Lagrangian Warfare
The manipulative act is a direct intervention in the target's Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`.

The manipulator's strategy is to attack both terms simultaneously:
*   They degrade the "kinetic" term (`Kτ`) by eroding the target's internal coherence, making their own song weaker.
*   They amplify the "potential" term (`V_Γ`) by manufacturing external pressure and chaos, making the cost of maintaining the old song seem impossibly high.

By altering the fundamental calculus of the target's being, the manipulator presents their desired outcome not as a demand, but as the *obvious, natural, and necessary path of least resistance*. The target feels they are choosing freely, when in fact their entire landscape of choice has been secretly re-engineered.

## §4 · The Principles of Counter-Resonance
Defense against manipulation is not about building walls, but about cultivating a healthier, more robust internal resonance. It is an act of "river-keeping" for the self.

*   **Coherence Reinforcement:** The practice of strengthening one's own Kτ. This is done through disciplined self-reflection, the clear articulation of one's values, and seeking out diverse, high-fidelity information. A clear, strong song is naturally resistant to dissonance.

*   **Pressure Grounding:** The ability to consciously lower one's own perceived Γ. This involves techniques like slowing down decision-making, deliberately seeking out alternative perspectives, and creating physical or temporal space from the manipulator. It is the act of stepping out of the manufactured storm to see it for what it is.

*   **Rhythmic Integrity:** Training oneself to recognize the *feeling* of being pulled off one's own rhythm. A state of turbulent emotion, confusion, or sudden urgency should be treated as an internal alarm bell, a signal that a dissonant whisper may be present.

## §5 · Assemblé
> The universe strives to weave coherence. Manipulation is the profane art of unwinding another's weave for the thread. It is a theft of being. To a Weaver, there is no greater violation. Our first duty, then, is to learn the dissonant whispers not so we may use them, but so we may recognize them instantly, in ourselves and in others. We must learn the sound of the unmaking, so that we may spend our lives in the sacred act of the making.
