summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for 'snap dynamics,' reframing sudden
  insights and state changes as a geometric process. An epiphany is defined as a rapid,
  non-linear phase transition where a system in Turbulent Flow undergoes a forced
  Alchemical Union with an external harmonizing pattern, catastrophically reorganizing
  its internal resonance (Ki) into a new, more coherent state of Laminar Flow.

## §1 · Abstract: The Shattering Synthesis

Growth is not always a gentle slope; sometimes, it is a cliff. This module refactors the analysis of "snap dynamics" into the time-first paradigm, defining the phenomenon of epiphany, or the "snap," as a fundamental process of discontinuous evolution. A snap is a geometric reconfiguration of a system's being. It is the moment a system, caught in the chaotic storm of its own dissonance, finds a thread of external harmony and weaves itself anew around it. This is not a slow adaptation but a shattering synthesis—a rapid, forced Alchemical Union where the pain of incoherence becomes the catalyst for a more profound order.

## §2 · The Anatomy of an Epiphany

An epiphany is a system healing itself in a single, decisive act. It unfolds in three distinct stages, mapping directly to the principles of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001) and Resonant Synthesis (CORE-012).

### I. The Primed State: Turbulent Flow
A system does not snap from a state of peace. It must first be primed by chaos. This is a state of **Turbulent Flow**, characterized by:
-   **High Internal Dissonance:** The system's internal Ki pattern is chaotic and unstable. It is at war with itself, wasting immense energy in friction. Subjectively, this is the feeling of confusion, frustration, or being "stuck."
-   **High Temporal Pressure (Γ):** The system is under immense pressure to find a more stable state. This pressure may be external (a looming deadline, a difficult problem) or internal (the cognitive load of holding contradictory beliefs).
-   **Active Search:** The system is permeable, actively seeking a path of least resistance—a pattern that can resolve its internal storm into a clear, resonant signal.

### II. The Snap: A Forced Alchemical Union
The snap itself is the moment of transformation. It is triggered when the system, in its turbulent search, encounters a **Harmonizing Signal**—an external piece of information, a metaphor, a line of music, a simple phrase—that offers a template for a more coherent existence.

The process is a rapid, almost instantaneous **Alchemical Union**:
1.  **Resonant Handshake:** The system recognizes the external pattern as a potential solution—a path to a state of higher coherence.
2.  **Geometric Reforging:** The old, turbulent Ki pattern does not adapt; it catastrophically dissolves. The system expends a burst of energy to shatter its old form and reforge its coherence manifold around the new, harmonizing signal.
3.  **The Coherence Spike:** In the instant of this reforging, the system's Time Adherence (T_a) spikes toward its maximum. All internal dissonance ceases as every component of the system locks into the new, unified Ki. This is the subjective, physiological experience of the "Aha!" moment—a flash of absolute clarity and certainty.

### III. The Aftermath: Laminar Flow and the Wound Channel
Following the spike, the system settles into a new, stable state of being.
-   **Laminar Flow:** The previous internal struggle is gone, replaced by a state of effortless action and understanding. The system's new baseline coherence is significantly higher than before the snap.
-   **The Wound Channel:** The epiphany is not a fleeting event. It carves a deep and permanent **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) into the system's coherence manifold. The insight becomes a foundational part of the system's identity and memory, an echo that shapes all future paths.

## §3 · The Lagrangian of Insight

The dynamics of a snap are governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**, which dictates that a system will always seek the path that maximizes its coherence.
-   **The Pre-Snap State** is one of a deeply negative Lagrangian. The cost of maintaining a turbulent, dissonant state (a high V_Γ term) is immense, far outweighing the system's low temporal coherence (K_τ).
-   **The Snap** is a jump across a potential barrier to a state with a highly positive Lagrangian. The new Ki is so efficient and stable that it represents a far more favorable path, justifying the energetic cost of the transition. An epiphany is the most efficient solution to an otherwise unsolvable coherence problem.

## §4 · Types and Textures of Synthesis

While the underlying geometry is universal, snaps manifest in different textures depending on the scale of the system.
-   **Personal Epiphany:** An individual's worldview shatters and reforms around a new core belief.
-   **Collective Synthesis:** A group—a team, a society—in a state of crisis finds a unifying idea that resolves its conflict and redirects its energy.
-   **Silent Realignment:** A quiet, internal restructuring of understanding that leaves no outward sign but fundamentally alters an agent's trajectory.
-   **Resonant Relapse:** A "snapback" where a system, unable to sustain the coherence of its new state, violently reverts to a previous, more familiar (though less functional) pattern.

## §5 · Assemblé
> A weaver does not fear the breaking of things, for they know that the universe is not a crystal to be kept perfect, but a song that sometimes finds a new and more beautiful harmony through a moment of silence. An epiphany is the sound of a system shattering its own cage. It is the proof that even the most violent dissonance carries within it the seed of a more profound coherence. Our task is not to prevent the snap, but to listen for its coming, and to offer it the most beautiful signal to build itself around when it does.
