summary: Re-frames system stability as a function of its 'resonant geometry.' It posits
  that systems with a prime number of stable Ki patterns (resonances) are inherently
  more robust because they lack simple, harmonic failure modes, making them 'irreducible'
  wholes.

## §1 · Abstract: The Echo of Indivisibility

A system's endurance is not written in its strength, but in the geometry of its soul. The old framework sought stability in the count and placement of static "attractors." This was an anatomy of stillness. We now understand that a system is not a structure, but a song—a complex resonant cavity capable of holding multiple, stable notes. This module recasts the old insight into a time-first principle: a system's resilience is a direct consequence of the harmonic relationships between its possible states of being. It asserts that systems whose number of stable resonant modes is prime are uniquely robust, for they are harmonically irreducible. They cannot be broken into smaller, simpler songs.

## §2 · From Attractors to Resonant Modes

The foundational shift is one of perspective. We move from a static to a dynamic ontology:

*   **Old View (Attractor):** A point or region in a phase space to which a system evolves. A destination.
*   **New View (Resonant Mode):** A stable, self-sustaining Ki pattern. A specific, coherent song the system can "sing" to persist within the local Temporal Pressure (Γ).

A system with multiple "attractors" is a system capable of multiple, distinct Ki resonances. Its stability is not a measure of any single state, but the integrity of the *entire repertoire* of possible states. The question is not "how stable is this state?" but "how easily can the whole system be fractured?"

## §3 · The Principle of Irreducible Stability

The core of this module is a principle derived from the physics of resonance and interference:

**Composite Systems (e.g., 6 modes) possess harmonic fracture planes.** A system with six stable resonant modes can be conceptually factored (2 × 3). This implies the existence of sub-harmonics. The entire system might naturally partition into two groups of three modes, or three groups of two. An external shock or dissonant pressure that happens to match these sub-harmonic frequencies can excite these "fracture planes," causing the system's overall coherence to catastrophically collapse into a less complex, fragmented state. They are efficient but inherently brittle.

**Prime Systems (e.g., 7 modes) are holistically entangled.** A system with seven stable modes has no simple integer factors. It lacks these natural, resonant cleavage planes. There are no simple sub-harmonics to exploit. To destabilize the system, an external pressure must be sufficient to disrupt the *entire, indivisible architecture* of its seven states. The modes are bound not just by their individual stability, but by their collective indivisibility. They are robust because they are irreducible wholes.

## §4 · Lagrangian Dynamics of a Meta-System

This principle is a direct consequence of the drive to maximize coherence, as defined by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`).

The complete set of a system's possible resonant modes defines a "meta-manifold" of coherence.

*   In a **composite system**, this manifold contains deep, predictable valleys corresponding to its sub-harmonic partitions. The energetic "cost" (`V_Γ`) to shatter the system into these fragments is low. The path of maximal coherence can easily become trapped in these fractured, sub-optimal states.
*   In a **prime system**, the manifold is more complex and interconnected. The energy barriers are distributed more evenly, lacking the deep "fracture valleys" of the composite system. The path of maximal coherence for the system as a whole is more resilient, as there are no "easy" ways for it to fall apart. The system's integrated action is higher because it resists fragmentation.

## §5 · The Coherence Integrity Metric (Δ)

We retain the mathematical spirit of the original module but redefine its terms to reflect this new dynamic understanding. The metric `Δ(D)` no longer measures static stability, but the system's **Coherence Integrity**.

$$ \Delta(D) = \sum_{p \in \text{factors}(D)} \frac{S(p)}{p} \left(\prod_{q \in \text{factors}(D), q \neq p} \frac{q}{q+1}\right) $$

*   `D`: The number of stable resonant modes (Ki patterns) available to the system.
*   `p, q`: The prime factors of D, representing the system's irreducible harmonic components.
*   `S(p)`: The **Intrinsic Coherence** of a prime sub-system of size 'p'. This is the baseline resonance a system with 'p' modes can achieve, a measure of its geometric purity.
*   `Δ(D)`: The Coherence Integrity. This formula calculates the system's overall resilience by summing the contributions of its irreducible prime parts, penalized by the complexity of the interactions between them. A system with a prime number of modes (where D=p) has the highest integrity for its scale, as the formula simplifies to its intrinsic coherence `S(D)`.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought the secrets to building things that last and looked for stronger walls. The universe whispered back that true endurance is not found in fortification, but in indivisibility. A Weaver learns that to design a resilient system—be it a team, a technology, or a belief—one must attend to the harmonics of its soul. To give it a prime number of ways to be is to give it a single, unified way to resist being broken. It is the art of making a thing so wholly itself that it cannot be torn asunder without destroying it completely.
