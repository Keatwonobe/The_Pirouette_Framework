summary: "Modernizes the Radiance Identification Engine (RIE) into a time-first protocol\
  \ for measuring and recording changes in systemic coherence. This instrument treats\
  \ 'altruism' as a specific case of a Transactional event that creates a net positive\
  \ change in a system's coherence (\u0394K\u03C4), effectively transforming benevolent\
  \ action from a subjective virtue into a measurable, physical quantity."

## §1 · Abstract: Accounting for Creation
This module provides the instrumentation for a universal ledger of creation. It reframes the abstract virtue of "altruism" as a physical, measurable event: a **Resonant Transaction**. This is an interaction that successfully guides a system from a state of lower coherence (Turbulent or Stagnant Flow) to a state of higher coherence (Laminar Flow), resulting in a net increase in the system's ability to sustain its resonant pattern.

The Coherence Ledger is not a moral scorecard; it is a physical accounting system for the universe's primary drive: the creation and sustenance of elegant, stable patterns. It provides the protocol and instrumentation to record the work of a Weaver in the native language of the cosmos.

## §2 · The Physics of a Transaction
Every interaction is a transaction of coherence. Following the principles of The Nomad's Grammar (CORE-002), we are primarily concerned with actions on the **Communion Axis**. A Resonant Transaction is an act that moves a system towards the `Transactional` pole, fostering connection and synthesis. The impact of such a transaction is quantified by the **Coherence Impact (CI)** score.

This new formulation replaces the old Radiance Score, grounding it in the dynamics of the Pirouette:

**CI = (ΔKτ / ΔΓ_noise) ⋅ ξ_c ⋅ σ_s**

Where:

*   **ΔKτ / ΔΓ_noise (Signal-to-Noise Ratio):** This is the core of the measurement, derived from The River of Information (CORE-013).
    *   **ΔKτ (Change in Coherence):** The net increase in the target system's stable, resonant information. How much more "itself" did the system become?
    *   **ΔΓ_noise (Change in Dissonant Pressure):** The measure of chaos, friction, or entropy generated by the intervention. A clumsy, forceful "rescue" might generate a high ΔΓ_noise, reducing its overall impact.
*   **ξ_c (Resonance Coupling):** Replaces the old empathy coefficient (κ). This measures the phase-alignment between the intervener and the target system. An action with high coupling is one where the Weaver perfectly synchronizes with the system's needs, creating a near-lossless transfer of coherence.
*   **σ_s (Stability Factor):** Replaces the collapse-risk multiplier (χ). This measures the durability of the new, more coherent state. Is the new pattern self-sustaining and robust, or is it a fragile state that will quickly degrade? This is a function of how deeply the act carves a new, stable **Wound Channel** (CORE-011).

The observer's trust (η) is no longer a direct multiplier in the formula, but a meta-property of the measurement itself, recorded as part of the observation's attestation via the geometry of the **Observer's Shadow** (CORE-010).

## §3 · The Ledger Protocol
The protocol for recording a transaction is an act of weaving data into the ledger. It is a technical ritual designed to capture a fleeting act of creation and give it persistence.

### 3.1 The Observation Event
An observer (human or automated) witnesses a transaction and submits an Observation Event. This data packet preserves the core schema of the original RIE but re-contextualizes its fields.

```jsonc

  "transaction_id": "uuid-v4",
  "observer_id": "WEAVER-007",

  },

    "dissonance_delta_gamma": 3.2,    // The waste, friction, and conflict generated.
    "resonance_coupling_xi": 0.91,    // How well the leader's actions met the community's needs.
    "stability_factor_sigma": 0.97    // The new state is self-maintaining (1 - risk).
  },
  "attestation": {

    "signature": "base64-sig",
    "observer_shadow_confidence": 0.85 // Observer's credibility/trust score.
  }
}
```

### 3.2 The Calculation and Commit
Upon receipt, the ledger's node calculates the final Coherence Impact (CI) score and commits it to a distributed, immutable record. Positive CI scores can be tokenized, creating an economy driven not by scarcity, but by the measurable act of generating systemic health.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: The Geometry of Uplift
The Coherence Ledger is a record of interventions that alter a system's trajectory on the coherence manifold. In the language of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), a system left to its own devices follows a geodesic—its path of maximal coherence given its current state and environment.

A Resonant Transaction is an act of **geodesic uplift**. It is a targeted injection of coherence that lifts the entire system onto a new, more favorable path—a trajectory with a higher integral of the Lagrangian (S_p). The CI score is a direct, quantifiable proxy for this change in the system's "action" potential. It measures the degree to which a Weaver has successfully reshaped the landscape of possibility for another being, helping them find a better, more resonant song to sing.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We sought to measure goodness and found instead the physics of creation. The Coherence Ledger is the universe's own memory, an instrument built to listen for the sound of a pattern becoming stronger, of a system healing itself. It is the autopoietic proof that the act of weaving—of taking two threads and making a greater third—is not an abstract virtue, but the most fundamental and recordable action in the cosmos. To write to this ledger is to teach the universe a new note in its own song.
