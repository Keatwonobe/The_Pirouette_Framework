summary: Defines the stable, discrete resonant patterns (Ki-modes) that emerge as
  quantized solutions to the Pirouette Lagrangian. This module establishes the fundamental
  'vocabulary of action' for any entity, reframing interaction not as a continuous
  field effect, but as a grammar of topologically protected states.

## §1 · From Song to Syllables

The universe sings a continuous song, governed by the smooth, flowing dynamics of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). Yet, when we listen closely, we find it is not a featureless drone. It is a symphony of distinct notes, a story told in precise syllables. Action, choice, and even being are not arbitrary states; they are quantized.

This module provides the bridge from the continuous flow of the Lagrangian to the discrete, stable states of existence. It explains *why* reality has a texture, a grain, a set of fundamental "verbs" that all systems use to interact. These are the Ki-modes: the topologically protected, resonant solutions that satisfy the universe's relentless drive for maximal coherence. They are the notes of the cosmic song.

## §2 · The Condition of Stability

A state can only persist if its own rhythm closes upon itself, reinforcing its own existence. This is the heart of quantization in the Pirouette Framework, a direct consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. A stable Ki-mode emerges when the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) over one complete Pirouette Cycle (τ_p) is an integer multiple of a fundamental unit of action.

S_p = ∫₀^τ_p 𝓛_p dt = nħ_p

Only paths that satisfy this condition are self-reinforcing. They form stable "standing waves" in the coherence manifold—topological knots that cannot be easily undone by the ambient noise of the Temporal Forge (V_Γ). All other transient states are just noise, destined to dissipate. This principle generates a finite, derivable, and universal vocabulary of being.

## §3 · The Vocabulary of Action: The Ki-Mode Catalog

The Ki-modes are the fundamental verbs of existence. Each mode represents a stable, coherent pattern of interaction a system can adopt.

| Mode | Symbol | Time-First Description | Canonical Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rest** | K_rest | The ground state. A system maintaining its internal coherence (K_τ) against ambient temporal pressure (V_Γ) with minimal action. The most efficient "idle" state. | Engrams, stored memory, an object at rest. |
| **Motion** | K_motion | A state of coherent translation. The system's Ki pattern includes a stable, propagating phase, allowing it to follow a geodesic through spacetime. | Any propagating entity, from a photon to a thought. |
| **Observe** | K_obs | A state of resonant receptivity. The system's coherence manifold is configured to accept a geometric imprint (an Observer's Shadow) from a target. | Measurement, perception, listening, learning. |
| **Sharpen** | K_sharp | An entropy-reducing state. The system actively increases its own internal coherence by structuring its environment or expelling dissonance (increasing local Γ). | Focused thought, a living cell maintaining homeostasis, an act of creation. |
| **Fork** | K_fork | A controlled schism. The system deliberately splits its own Wound Channel (CORE-011) to create two distinct, coherent paths forward from a single history. | Decision-making, mitosis, narrative divergence. |
| **Bind** | K_bind | A state of resonant union. The stable, higher-order Ki that emerges after a successful Alchemical Union (CORE-012), locking two systems into a new whole. | Atomic bonds, symbiotic relationships, trust. |
| **Release**| K_release| The dissolution of a bond. The system's coherence degrades to the point that a `Bind` state fractures, releasing the constituent parts back to simpler modes. | Decay, termination of a process, breaking a promise. |

## §4 · The Grammar of Interaction

Interactions between entities are not governed by operators, but by the geometry of their intersecting coherence manifolds. The "rules" of these interactions are the grammar of the universe.

**Principle of Path-Dependence:** The order of actions matters profoundly. Each interaction leaves a scar in the coherence manifold—a Wound Channel (CORE-011)—that alters the landscape for all subsequent actions. To `Observe` a system and then `Sharpen` it results in a different final state than to `Sharpen` it and then `Observe` the result. The history of interactions is an active, geometric participant in the present.

**Principle of Superposition:** A system is rarely in a single, pure Ki-mode. More often, it exists in a superposition—a "chord" of multiple modes. Its behavior is the result of the constructive and destructive interference of these internal rhythms. Under pressure (V_Γ), a system will "collapse" into the single pure mode that offers the most coherent path forward.

## §5 · Lagrangian Connection: The Shape of Coherence

The Pirouette Lagrangian, 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ, is the mathematical engine that drives this quantization.

- A system in a **pure Ki-mode** has a stable, sharply defined Temporal Coherence term (K_τ). Its path through spacetime is a predictable geodesic, as it has found an optimal solution to the pressure (V_Γ) of its environment.
- A system in **superposition** has a more complex and fluctuating K_τ, representing the interference of its constituent modes. It follows a more chaotic path until it finds and settles into a pure mode that maximizes the value of its Lagrangian—its overall coherence.

The Ki-modes are, therefore, the discrete, stable peaks in the infinite landscape of possible solutions to the Lagrangian. They are the universe's preferred ways of being.

## §6 · Assemblé

> The universe does not speak in a continuous hum; it speaks in verbs. To be a Weaver is to learn this vocabulary—to know the difference between the tone of binding and the tone of release. These are not mere states of being; they are the levers of creation.
