summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for analyzing dominant ideas. It
  reframes 'Cognitive Gravity Wells' as high-coherence resonant patterns (Ki) that
  create deep potential wells in the cognitive manifold, functioning as a localized
  expression of the Gladiator Force. This module offers a protocol for mapping these
  wells and understanding their influence on thought trajectories.

## §1 · Abstract: The Resonance That Binds
A belief is not a static piece of information; it is a living rhythm. The most powerful beliefs are those whose rhythms are so stable, so coherent, and so persistent that they begin to organize the world around them.

This module refactors the concept of "Cognitive Gravity Wells" into the language of the time-first framework. A dominant idea is no longer seen as a "massive" object in a conceptual space, but as an intensely coherent resonant pattern (Ki) that impresses itself upon the cognitive manifold. This powerful resonance creates a localized coherence well—a region of high temporal pressure (Γ) and stability that attracts and aligns other, less coherent thoughts. This is the gravity of belief: the tendency for thought to follow the path of least resistance into the universe's most stable and compelling songs.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Coherence Well
A dominant paradigm, a cultural myth, or a deeply ingrained personal belief is a manifestation of the **Gladiator Force (CORE-008)** in the cognitive domain. It is the force that builds an arena for thought. Its properties arise from the core principles of the framework:

*   **Coherence (Kτ) as Conceptual Strength:** The "strength" of an idea is a direct measure of its temporal coherence. This is a function of its internal logical consistency, its explanatory power, and its resonance with other established beliefs. A high-coherence idea is a clear, loud, and stable signal in the cognitive environment. The old proxies of `Conceptual Mass` and `Narrative Velocity` are collapsed into this single, more fundamental measure.

*   **The Coherence Well as a Γ-Gradient:** A high-Kτ belief creates a significant increase in the local temporal pressure. It becomes a point of stability in a chaotic world of information. This creates a deep "well" in the coherence manifold. Just as gravity pulls matter into a star, the gravity of belief pulls thoughts into a paradigm, not through force, but by shaping the very landscape upon which they travel.

*   **The Wound Channel as Inertia (CORE-011):** The persistence of these wells is due to their nature as deeply carved **Wound Channels**. Culturally, they are encoded in texts, laws, and traditions. Individually, they are etched into neural pathways. This geometric scarring gives a paradigm its inertia, its resistance to change, and its ability to influence thought long after its initial formation.

## §3 · Dynamics of Influence: Trajectory and Transformation
A thought, like any system, seeks to maximize its own coherence. When it encounters a coherence well, its trajectory is fundamentally altered.

*   **Capture via Geodesic:** A thought is "pulled" into a belief system because that is its geodesic—its path of maximal coherence. Aligning with the dominant idea is the most energy-efficient way to resolve cognitive dissonance and find stability. This replaces the old concept of "Semantic Curvature."

*   **Resistance through Integrity:** A thinker's susceptibility to a coherence well is determined by the integrity of their own internal belief system (their own Kτ). A mind with high internal coherence and a stable Ki pattern can approach a powerful idea without being captured, observing it from a stable "orbit." A mind with low coherence is more likely to fall into the well, adopting the new belief to resolve its own internal turbulence.

*   **Synthesis via The Alchemical Union (CORE-012):** When a thinker's mind deeply engages with a powerful new idea, the outcome is not always simple capture. It can be a transformative **Alchemical Union**. The old belief system and the new paradigm undergo a Resonant Handshake, dissolving and reforging into a new, more complex, and more coherent worldview. The "Inversion Risk Factor" is re-framed as this "Synthesis Potential," a creative act rather than a passive risk.

## §4 · Diagnostic Protocol for Weavers
To navigate the world of ideas is to be a cartographer of these invisible landscapes. A Weaver can map them using the following protocol:

1.  **Identify Resonant Peaks:** Scan the cognitive landscape (a body of text, a discourse, a belief system) to identify the concepts with the highest coherence (Kτ). Use proxies like frequency, interconnectedness, persistence over time, and emotional charge. These are the centers of your wells.

2.  **Map the Coherence Gradient:** For each peak, map the "slope" of its influence. How strongly does it connect to and organize subordinate concepts? This defines the shape and depth of the well.

3.  **Assess Navigational Paths:** Analyze the thought trajectories within the landscape. Where is thought flowing effortlessly (laminar flow into a well)? Where is there conflict and friction (turbulent flow between two competing wells)? Where is progress blocked (stagnant flow)?

4.  **Evaluate Synthesis Potential:** Identify points of tension between a thinker's established beliefs and a coherence well. Are the conditions for a Resonant Handshake present? This predicts where a paradigm shift is most likely to occur.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The gravity of belief is described with mathematical precision by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

A coherence well is a region where the potential term, `V_Γ`, is extremely deep and negative, representing a state of very high stability and low "cost." For a wandering thought with low internal coherence (`K_τ`), the path that maximizes the Lagrangian (the action `S_p`) is to "fall" into this potential well. The feeling of certainty and clarity that comes from adopting a powerful belief is the direct experience of a system finding a state that maximizes its Lagrangian. Escaping the well requires a massive input of energy to increase one's own `K_τ` to a point where it can overcome the depth of the `V_Γ` term.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We do not simply have ideas; we inhabit them. Beliefs are the landscapes we walk through, the invisible wells and mountains that define our paths of least resistance. To a Weaver, this is not a metaphor. It is a physical reality of the mind. To map the gravity of belief is to understand why we think what we think. It is the first, necessary step toward true intellectual freedom: the ability to consciously choose a path, rather than merely following the one of steepest descent.
