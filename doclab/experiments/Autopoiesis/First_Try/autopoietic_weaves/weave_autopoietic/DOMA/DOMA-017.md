summary: "Introduces the central mathematical formalism of the framework, the Pirouette\
  \ Lagrangian (\U0001D4DB_p). This equation describes the 'action' of a resonant\
  \ system not in terms of energy, but as a dynamic interplay between its internal\
  \ temporal coherence and the external temporal density of its environment."

## §1 · From Song to Equation
The first five core modules have described the universe as a self-composing song. This is a potent philosophical and conceptual model, but to become a predictive physical theory, it must speak the language of mathematics. This module provides that translation, collapsing the old triaxial field theory of PPS-001 into a single, unified, and time-first formalism.

In the prior framework, reality was described by three distinct fields ($T_a, \Gamma, \phi$) interacting through a complex potential. The Great Refactoring reveals these are not separate entities, but facets of a single dynamic. The universe does not seek to merely extremize an action; it strives to maximize coherence.

## §2 · The Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)
The Pirouette Lagrangian describes the state of a system in terms of two fundamental quantities: its internal stability and its external pressure. It takes the familiar form of L = T - V, but reinterprets the terms through the lens of the autopoietic cycle.

𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)

Let us define these terms, which subsume and clarify the old fields:

**Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** This "kinetic" term represents the quality and intensity of a system's own rhythm. It is the product of its Time Adherence (T_a) and its fundamental resonant frequency (ω_k, where ω_k = 2π/τ_p). A system with a clear, fast rhythm has high coherence. This term unifies the old kinetic energies of Time-Adherence ($T_a$) and Phase ($\phi$) into a single, more descriptive quantity.

**Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** This "potential" term represents the "cost" of maintaining a specific rhythm against the background noise of the local Temporal Forge. It is a function of the local Gamma (Γ). A denser, more complex environment creates more pressure, making coherence more difficult to sustain. This term replaces the elaborate potential V($T_a, \Gamma, \phi$) from the old model, recognizing that Γ is not a dynamic field to be acted upon, but the background pressure itself.

Combining these gives the full Lagrangian:

𝓛_p = T_a ⋅ ω_k - f(Γ)

## §3 · The Principle of Maximal Coherence
The fundamental dynamic law of the Pirouette Framework is the Principle of Maximal Coherence. A system will evolve along a path that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian over one of its own Pirouette Cycles.

S_p = ∫₀ᵗᵖ 𝓛_p dt

A system will naturally adjust its state (its Ki, and therefore its ω_k and T_a) to find the "sweet spot"—the state of highest possible internal coherence for the lowest environmental cost. This is the mathematical formalization of the "path of least resistance" and the explicit, teleological goal that replaces the old model's neutral "Principle of Resonance Optimisation."

## §4 · Deriving the Forces of Nature
This Lagrangian is the engine from which all forces are derived. Forces are not fundamental pushes and pulls. In this framework, forces are gradients in the landscape of coherence.

By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to 𝓛_p, we derive the equations of motion for a system. These equations describe how a system must change its trajectory in response to changes in the surrounding temporal environment (Γ). A particle moving towards a massive star isn't being "pulled" by gravity; it is following a path of continuously adjusting its internal rhythm to maintain maximal coherence as it enters a region of rapidly increasing Temporal Pressure. All forces—gravity, electromagnetism, and the nuclear forces—are simply the geodesics on the manifold of coherence. This single engine thus provides the unified foundation for physics that the old framework could only approximate.

## §5 · Assemblé
> We sought the fundamental laws of physics and found the universe's objective function. The Pirouette Lagrangian is the formula for survival. It is the mathematical expression of the universe's ceaseless drive to find and sustain elegant, stable patterns against a backdrop of overwhelming chaos. It translates the poetry of the autopoietic cycle into a predictive engine. With this tool, we no longer need to merely describe the song; we can begin to calculate its notes.
