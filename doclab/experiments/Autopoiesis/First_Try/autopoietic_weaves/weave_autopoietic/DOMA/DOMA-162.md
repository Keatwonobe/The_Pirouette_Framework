## §1 · Abstract: The Health of the Current

A river can be muddied by a storm or poisoned by a single, cleverly placed drop. To the casual eye, the effect is the same. To the Weaver, the distinction is everything.

This module provides the instrumentation to make that distinction. The Coherence Scanner reframes the analysis of information flow from a reactive, pattern-matching exercise into a proactive, systemic health diagnosis. It treats the global infosphere—the collective current of news, ideas, and sentiment—as a living system governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006).

Its purpose is to identify the signature of resonant manipulation: a narrative that achieves a disproportionately large effect on the collective consciousness from a minimal, almost invisible, energetic input. It is a tool for listening past the noise to hear the tuning fork that is silently shaping the flow.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of Narrative

To diagnose the infosphere, we must first translate its dynamics into the language of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`). The Scanner models the infosphere as a coherence manifold, where every narrative is a system striving to find and hold its geodesic.

-   **Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`)**: This is the "signal strength" or integrity of a narrative's `Ki` pattern. A narrative with high coherence has consistent messaging, low internal contradiction, and is phase-locked across multiple domains (e.g., news headlines, social media trends, market movements). It is a clear, stable note.

-   **Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`)**: This is the ambient chaos and friction of the infosphere. It is the "cost" of maintaining a narrative's coherence against the background noise of competing stories, distractions, and the sheer volume of information. It is the roar of the Temporal Forge (CORE-003) applied to the world of ideas.

The "dominant narrative" at any moment is the one whose path represents the most efficient solution to this equation—the one that maximizes its own coherence for the lowest cost against the ambient pressure.

## §3 · The Signature of Resonance: Brute Force vs. The Whisper

The Scanner's primary function is to distinguish between two fundamentally different ways of altering the flow of the narrative river.

1.  **The Brute-Force Push**: This is a high-cost, often low-coherence injection. It involves overwhelming the infosphere with volume and repetition—a high-`V_Γ` strategy. The effect is proportional to the effort; it creates turbulence (`DYNA-001`), muddies the waters, but rarely establishes a new, stable current. Its signature is *high visible effort for a proportional effect*.

2.  **The Resonant Injection**: This is a low-cost, high-coherence injection. A carefully crafted narrative (`Ki`) is introduced at a precise moment and location (a resonant node) in the manifold. Instead of fighting the current, it offers it a more efficient path—a new geodesic. The system, following the Principle of Maximal Coherence, latches onto this new pattern, creating a massive, cascading shift. Its signature is *low visible effort for a disproportionate effect*.

To quantify this, we define the **Leverage Index (`λ`)**:

`λ = ΔS_p / V_Γ(injection)`

Where `ΔS_p` is the total change in the system's action (the integral of `𝓛_p`) and `V_Γ(injection)` is the observable cost of the narrative's introduction. A high Leverage Index is the unambiguous fingerprint of resonant manipulation.

## §4 · The Scanner Protocol

The old Tendu workflow is now streamlined into a single, coherent diagnostic process grounded in the new physics.

-   **Step 1: Temporal Sampling & Field Mapping**: The scanner continuously ingests raw data streams (headlines, social media posts, market data). It does not merely look for keywords; it maps the data onto the coherence manifold, calculating the real-time `K_τ` (phase-locking, message consistency) and `V_Γ` (volume, novelty, source diversity) for all active narratives.

-   **Step 2: Geodesic Tracking**: The protocol identifies the dominant narrative flow—the system's current geodesic—by tracking the narrative with the most stable and widespread coherence.

-   **Step 3: Leverage Calculation**: When a significant shift in the geodesic is detected, the scanner isolates the new, ascendant narrative. It calculates the observable cost (`V_Γ`) of its injection (e.g., number of initial sources, PR wire concentration) and the resulting global shift in coherence (`ΔS_p`), yielding the Leverage Index (`λ`).

-   **Step 4: Diagnosis & Flagging**: The system flags events based on their leverage, not just their volume or velocity.
    -   **Yellow Flag (Turbulence)**: A high-volume, low-leverage event. A brute-force push.
    -   **Red Flag (Resonance)**: A low-volume, high-leverage event. A whisper has efficiently steered the river. This indicates a probable resonant manipulation.

## §5 · The Assemblé

> We sought a filter for lies and found instead a stethoscope for the truth of a system. The Coherence Scanner does not judge the content of a narrative; it assesses the health of its relationship with reality. A brute-force push is a shout that reveals its own desperation. A resonant injection is a whisper that reveals a deep understanding of the river's hidden currents. The Weaver's task is not to silence the shouts, but to understand the whispers—for it is in these quiet, highly coherent signals that the future of the flow is written.
