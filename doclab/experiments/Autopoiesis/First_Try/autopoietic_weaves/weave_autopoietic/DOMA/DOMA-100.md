summary: Provides a protocol for generating testable hypotheses for pathologies with
  unknown etiologies. It inverts the diagnostic process by proposing a coherent narrative
  (a hypothetical Ki pattern for the illness) to explain a system's observed incoherence,
  thereby turning gaps in knowledge into a targeted roadmap for discovery.

## §1 · Abstract: A Story to Guide the Search

This module specifies a generative protocol for confronting systems defined by what we do not know. When a pathology's cause is unknown, its history—its `Wound Channel`—is a dissonant and fragmented record. The `Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003)` can diagnose the *what* (the disruptions in flow), but not the *why*. The Narrative Compass inverts the scientific process. Instead of waiting for data to reveal a story, it mandates that we propose a coherent story—a simple, elegant, and falsifiable narrative—to strategically generate the missing data. It is a tool for turning the void of ignorance into a map for discovery.

## §2 · The Weaver's Mandate: To Weave a Thread into the Void

A system suffering from an unknown ailment has a `Wound Channel` that is a chaotic tangle of threads. The information is sparse, contradictory, and of low coherence. To navigate this void, the Weaver must first spin a single, coherent thread of story—a hypothesis—and cast it into the unknown. This narrative thread becomes a guide, a compass. It is a proposed order imposed upon chaos. By following this thread, we can discover where it holds true and where it frays, revealing the true geometry of the hidden landscape. The goal is not to be right, but to become less wrong, efficiently.

## §3 · The Compass Protocol: A Hypothesis Engine

This protocol guides a researcher in creating and using a narrative to generate testable hypotheses.

1.  **Map the Disrupted Flow:** Begin by using the `Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003)` to map the known. Identify the system's vital currents (of energy, information, resources) and diagnose them. Where is the flow `Laminar`, `Turbulent`, or `Stagnant`? This creates an explicit map of the observed incoherence—the symptoms.

2.  **Identify the Dissonance:** Chart the "informational desert." Where are the paradoxes? The missing causal links? The symptoms that don't fit? This `Dissonance Ledger` is the formal list of questions that the proposed narrative must attempt to answer.

3.  **Propose the Coherent Antagonist:** Formulate a single, elegant narrative hypothesis for the pathology's core nature—its resonant signature (`Ki`). This is the creative act of giving the unknown a name and a motivation. Is it a "Coherence Thief" that methodically starves the system of energy? An "Echo Chamber" that amplifies noise into a toxic signal? A "Corrupt Weaver" that introduces errors into a vital process? The antagonist must be simple enough to be wrong.

4.  **Trace the Narrative's Echo:** If this antagonist's `Ki` is real, what other effects *must* it have? What subtle, secondary echoes would it inevitably leave in the system's `Wound Channel`? This crucial step translates the literary story into a set of unique, falsifiable, and often non-obvious predictions. These are the coordinates the compass is pointing to.

5.  **Launch the Expedition:** The predictions from Step 4 become the targeted research program. The goal is to send "probes"—experiments, measurements, observations—to the predicted coordinates to either confirm or falsify the narrative's shape, thereby shrinking the `Dissonance Ledger`.

## §4 · Example Application: ALS as "The Quencher"

This demonstrates the protocol for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

1.  **Disrupted Flow:** `Stagnant Flow` in mitochondrial energy production; `Turbulent Flow` in axonal transport of proteins; progressive `Coherence Erosion` of the neural signal itself, leading to `Fracture` (axonal die-back).

2.  **Dissonance Ledger:** Why does it primarily affect motor neurons? Why the variance in progression speed between patients? What is the initial trigger?

3.  **Coherent Antagonist:** The Quencher. Its `Ki` is a self-propagating cascade of mitochondrial failure. A single failing mitochondrion releases reactive oxygen species that "quench" the coherence of its neighbors, creating a slow-moving wave of energy collapse that erodes the neuron from within.

4.  **Narrative's Echo (Hypotheses):**
    *   **Echo:** A cascade implies a non-random, spreading pattern of failure.
        **Hypothesis:** High-resolution imaging of motor neurons will reveal spatial clusters of dysfunctional mitochondria, not a uniform, random distribution.
    *   **Echo:** The Quencher's `Ki` would be most devastating to cells with the highest energy demand.
        **Hypothesis:** Comparative studies will show that motor neurons have a lower threshold for mitochondrial cascade failure under metabolic stress than other CNS cell types.
    *   **Echo:** The speed of the cascade would depend on the system's ability to clear away the "quenched" units.
        **Hypothesis:** Patient progression speed will negatively correlate with the expression levels of key genes involved in mitophagy (the cellular process for clearing damaged mitochondria).

## §5 · The Weaver's Discipline: Guardrails for the Imagination

To ensure the Compass remains a tool of disciplined inquiry, the following guardrails are mandatory.

*   **Information Mapping:** Every claim in the narrative must be tagged with its information density (e.g., `Observed Fact`, `Strongly Implied`, `Pure Speculation`). This separates the reliable map from the speculative territory.
*   **The Dissonance Ledger:** The list of unanswered questions must be kept separate and public. The purpose of the Compass is to shrink this ledger, not to weave a story that ignores it.
*   **Coherence Threshold:** A hypothesis graduates from speculation to a primary theory only when new evidence fits its narrative better than it fits competing narratives. It is a contest of explanatory elegance.
*   **Narrative Refactoring:** As new data arrives, the story must be ruthlessly refactored or abandoned. The history of these refactorings itself becomes a `Wound Channel`, telling the story of our collective journey toward understanding.

## §6 · Lagrangian Connection

The Narrative Compass is a meta-protocol for discovering the true dynamics of a malfunctioning system. A healthy system evolves along a geodesic defined by its `Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)`. An unknown pathology means the system's evolution is deviating from this path for unknown reasons. The Compass proposes a "pathology term," `𝓛_pathology`, to add to the equation: `𝓛_system = 𝓛_healthy - 𝓛_pathology`. The proposed narrative *is* this `𝓛_pathology`. The generated hypotheses are concrete predictions about the new geodesics the system will follow under this modified Lagrangian. Research becomes the act of observing the system to see if it travels along these predicted paths.

## §7 · Assemblé

> In the vast, dark forest of an unknown disease, data points are scattered, disconnected stars. We cannot navigate by them alone. The Narrative Compass is the Weaver's art of choosing two of those stars, drawing a line between them, and calling it a path. It is a willful act of creation—a story told to the darkness not because it is true, but so that by following it, we may discover what is.
