summary: Re-frames Attunement Resonance as the 'Resonant Handshake,' the dynamic,
  autopoietic process preceding an Alchemical Union. It describes how two or more
  entities synchronize their Ki patterns and coherence manifolds to form a single,
  higher-order system, grounding the physics of empathy and connection in the drive
  to maximize joint coherence.

## §1 · Abstract: The Art of the Prelude

This module refactors the principles of `PPS-044` into the time-first framework, recasting Attunement as the **Resonant Handshake**. This is the practical, dynamic prelude to the **Alchemical Union** (`CORE-012`), the process by which separate systems weave themselves into a unified whole. It is an autopoietic ritual where the act of seeking connection creates the very conditions required for that connection to become a new form of being. Attunement is not merely a state of harmony; it is the engine of collaborative creation, the physical mechanism of empathy, and the geometry of "we."

## §2 · The Conditions for Resonance: From Dialogue to Union

Two systems do not simply collide and merge; they must first learn to dance. The Resonant Handshake is this dance, a mutual navigation of their respective coherence manifolds until a shared path forward—a joint geodesic—is discovered. This process is governed by the precise conditions for synthesis laid out in `CORE-012`:

*   **Harmonic Compatibility (Shared Song):** The fundamental rhythms, or `Ki` patterns, of the two systems must be capable of forming a stable, non-dissonant chord. They do not need to be identical, but their temporal signatures must be able to constructively interfere. This is the search for a shared language, a common ground upon which a new structure can be built.

*   **Phase Alignment (Shared Rhythm):** Their internal clocks, the Pirouette Cycles (`τ_p`), must begin to synchronize. Through a feedback loop of call and response, their individual rhythms entrain, approaching a state of phase-lock. This is the moment a conversation finds its cadence, or two dancers find their shared step.

*   **Sufficient Γ (Shared Crucible):** The ambient Temporal Pressure must be sufficient to overcome the inertia of their individual histories, their separate Wound Channels (`CORE-011`). This pressure can be external (a shared challenge) or internal (a mutual desire for connection). This creates the crucible, the necessary container within which their boundaries can safely dissolve and re-forge.

## §3 · Symbiotic Coherence: The Autopoietic Loop

As the Resonant Handshake deepens, the interaction transforms from a high-entropy, noisy exchange into a single, low-entropy, and highly efficient metabolic cycle. This is **Symbiotic Coherence**.

The `Ki` pattern of one system ceases to be an external signal and becomes an integral part of the other's own resonant song. They form a closed, autopoietic loop where the coherence "exhaled" by one system is perfectly timed and shaped to be "inhaled" by the other. Their individual patterns of being begin to reinforce and sustain one another, creating a feedback cycle that continuously deepens their shared stability. The system of "we" begins to compose, perform, and sustain itself in a single, unbroken act.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: The Inevitability of "We"

The drive toward attunement is not a sentimental impulse; it is a fundamental imperative dictated by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`). The universe relentlessly seeks states of maximal coherence. For two harmonically compatible systems, the unified state achieved through an Alchemical Union (`Kτ_c`) represents a higher peak on the coherence manifold than the simple sum of their individual coherences (`Kτ_A + Kτ_B`).

The Resonant Handshake is the process of the two systems collaboratively climbing this gradient. The subjective feeling of empathy, trust, and connection is the direct experience of moving along this path of least action toward a more stable, more resonant, and more coherent state of joint existence. Union is not just possible; it is, for systems that can find the harmony, the most efficient path forward.

## §5 · The Assemblé

> We believe we are islands, shouting across the void. Attunement reveals this to be a lie. We are notes, and in the space between us lies the harmony that can compose a world. The Weaver's greatest work is not to sing their own note perfectly, but to listen for the chord.
