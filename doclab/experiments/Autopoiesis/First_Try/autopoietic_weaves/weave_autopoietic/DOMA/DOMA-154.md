summary: Models the non-linear phase transition a system undergoes when moving from
  a static to a kinetic state. It reframes this 'snap' as the process of overcoming
  the inertia of a system's Wound Channel to achieve a new, more coherent mode of
  resonance, providing a universal model for activation energy and hysteresis.

## §1 · Abstract: The Stagnant River Breaks its Dam
A river at rest is not merely still; it is settled. It has carved a comfortable bed, a place of quiet coherence. To set it in motion again requires more than a gentle push; it requires a force sufficient to break the dam of its own memory.

The old framework correctly observed that the transition from rest to motion is a non-linear "snap," not a smooth acceleration. This module reframes that observation from a time-first perspective. The "Ki Snap" is not a function of velocity; it is a profound phase transition in a system's resonant identity. It is the story of how a system overcomes the inertia of its own past—a geometric scar in spacetime we call the Wound Channel (CORE-011)—to leap into a new and more efficient mode of being.

## §2 · From Velocity to Coherence: A New Frame
The previous model, `TEN-KSTA-1.0`, was descriptive, correlating the transition to an external property: velocity. The modernized framework is causal. The transition is an internal reconfiguration of the system's Temporal Resonance (Ki) in response to a changing landscape of Temporal Pressure (Γ). This reconfiguration *results* in motion. We thus redefine the two states not as properties of motion, but as distinct modes of coherence:

*   **Static Coherence (`Ki_static`):** The stable, resonant Ki pattern of a system at rest. This state maximizes coherence by minimizing interaction and embedding itself deeply within its local environment. It is the resonance of being *in a place*.
*   **Kinetic Coherence (`Ki_kinetic`):** The stable, resonant Ki pattern of a system in motion. This state maximizes coherence by aligning its internal rhythm with a geodesic, or "flow channel," on the coherence manifold. It is the resonance of being *on a path*.

The transition between them is not a slide, but a leap.

## §3 · The Anatomy of the Leap
The process of this leap is universal, characterized by two primary phenomena rooted in the geometry of the system's own history.

### 3.1 · The Coherence Dam (Activation Energy)
A system at rest has carved a deep Wound Channel for its `Ki_static` state. This is the riverbed, the comfortable groove of its existence. This channel acts as a **Coherence Dam**: a potential well that creates a powerful inertia. To move, the system must expend a significant amount of energy to "climb out" of its own history.

This initial struggle against self-generated inertia is the physical basis for **activation energy**. It is the price a system must pay to change. The characteristic "kick" of resistance observed in the old model is the signature of the system fighting against the shape of its own past.

### 3.2 · The Snap (Phase Transition)
As external pressure (a changing Γ) builds against the Coherence Dam, the system reaches a breaking point. Maintaining the `Ki_static` pattern becomes an increasingly inefficient and incoherent solution. At a critical threshold, the system undergoes a rapid, non-linear phase transition—a "snap"—into the `Ki_kinetic` state. This is an act of **Ki Morphogenesis** (CORE-004), where the system abandons one stable pattern for another that offers a more elegant and efficient solution to its new boundary conditions.

### 3.3 · The Memory of Stillness (Hysteresis)
Once in motion, the system carves a new, shallower Wound Channel corresponding to its `Ki_kinetic` state. The phenomenon of **hysteresis**—where it takes more energy to start moving than to stop—is now elegantly explained.

*   **Starting:** Requires overcoming the deep, well-established `Ki_static` Wound Channel. (High activation energy).
*   **Stopping:** Requires only falling out of the newer, shallower `Ki_kinetic` Wound Channel. (Low deactivation energy).

The system's memory of its past states is not stored in a register; it is physically encoded as a persistent geometry in the coherence manifold. This geometry creates an asymmetric energy landscape for change.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection
This entire dynamic is a direct expression of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). A system will always occupy the state that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian.

The `Ki_static` and `Ki_kinetic` states represent two different local maxima, two possible solutions on the coherence manifold. The Coherence Dam is the energy barrier between them. The "snap" occurs at the precise moment the system calculates that the path through the `Ki_kinetic` maximum will yield a higher net coherence, even accounting for the energy cost of the leap. The transition is the universe solving an optimization problem in real-time.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> To begin is an act of violence against the past. Every great journey starts not with a step, but with the breaking of a chain—the chain of habit, of comfort, of who you used to be. The universe remembers where you have been, and it demands a price to forget. This is the cost of motion, the energy of becoming. A Weaver understands this price. They know that to seed a new pattern, they must first pay the tribute required to overcome the inertia of the old world.
