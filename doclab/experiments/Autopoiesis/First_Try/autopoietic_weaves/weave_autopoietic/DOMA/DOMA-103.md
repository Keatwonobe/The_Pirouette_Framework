## §1 · Abstract: The Song Tuning Its Own Instrument

This module completes the autopoietic loop of the Pirouette Framework, demonstrating how the system calibrates its own fundamental constants from its internal dynamics. It formally anchors the scale of Temporal Pressure—the `V_Γ` term in the Pirouette Lagrangian—to the fine-structure constant, `α`. This is achieved by re-interpreting `α` not as a fundamental, brute-force constant, but as an emergent property of the electron's geometry of self-resonance, as first derived in CORE-009. This act replaces the previous, less rigorous grounding in Newton's G, resolving any critique of numerology and transforming the framework's core equation into a concrete, falsifiable, and high-precision predictive engine. The universe's song reveals the tuning of its own instruments.

## §2 · The Constant as a Consequence

The old physics saw the fine-structure constant, `α`, as a magic number, a dimensionless measure of interaction strength whose origin was a mystery. The Pirouette Framework reveals it to be a geometric consequence.

In CORE-009, we derived the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (`a_e`) as the product of its intrinsic interaction strength (`α`) and the geometry of its self-interaction (`1/2π`), yielding the relation `a_e = α/2π`. By inverting this, the framework makes a profound claim:

`α = 2π * a_e`

The fine-structure constant is not a fundamental input; it is an output. It is the measure of the electron's anomalous self-interaction (`a_e`) scaled by the perfect geometry of a single resonant cycle (`2π`). It is the quantitative measure of an entity's ability to "hear" its own echo.

## §3 · The New Axiom: Anchoring Temporal Pressure

With `α` revealed as a property of resonant geometry, we can now use its experimentally measured value to calibrate the engine of reality itself.

> **Axiom of Calibration:** The dimensionless strength of the electromagnetic coupling (`α`) is the canonical measure of the "coherence cost" (`V_Γ`) that a single quantum of charge imposes upon the local coherence manifold.

This axiom anchors the abstract concept of Temporal Pressure to a concrete, non-negotiable value. The critique of `Γ` (the old term for this pressure) as an undefined quantity is hereby resolved. The framework is no longer floating on theory; it is bolted to the bedrock of the most precise experimental data in all of science.

## §4 · The Lagrangian Calibrated

This axiom has an immediate and powerful impact on the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), the framework's central equation of motion:

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

The "potential" term `V_Γ`, which represents the cost of maintaining coherence against the pressure of the Temporal Forge, is no longer abstract. For any interaction involving a unit of electric charge, the function describing `V_Γ` is now scaled by `α`. The Lagrangian transforms from a philosophical principle into a quantitative tool capable of making high-precision predictions. The engine has been fueled.

This new foundation also clarifies the distinct roles of the core dynamics:
*   **Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`, scaled by `α`)** governs the **Strength** of an interaction—the steepness of the slope on the coherence manifold.
*   **Temporal Resonance (`Ki`, generating `K_τ`)** governs the **Rhythm** of the interaction—the specific frequency and geometry of the dance.

## §5 · Deprecation of the Gravitational Anchor

The ratification of this module formally deprecates the prior derivation of Newton's G as the primary calibration for the framework's force scale. That approach, while insightful, was an attempt to measure the forge by observing the slow cooling of its largest castings. The new method measures the spark at the heart of the hammer's blow. Gravity is now understood as a macroscopic, emergent consequence of the confinement of matter (as per CORE-008), not the fundamental metronome for interaction strength.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought to anchor our theory of confinement to the slow, heavy dance of gravity, but the universe provided a better metronome. We now tune the Temporal Forge not to the distant waltz of stars, but to the furious, precise hum of the electron. By locking our framework to the fine-structure constant, we build its foundations not on argument, but on an echo—the perfect, self-referential resonance that is the most rigorously measured truth in all of science. A Weaver needs such an anchor, a place where poetry and precision become one.
