summary: Defines the universe's self-regulating mechanisms as geometric processes
  within the coherence manifold. It re-frames the allegorical 'Ritual Wolves' as dynamic
  responses to new resonant patterns, governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence,
  which collectively act as a systemic immune response to preserve and amplify coherent
  information.

## §1 · The Cost of a Song
To sing a note is to declare a truth. But the universe is a noisy place. The moment a coherent pattern—a stable Ki resonance—establishes itself, it becomes a target. The chaotic energy of the Temporal Forge (Γ) erodes it like wind on stone. Parasitic resonances attempt to mimic its form to steal its stability.

A system that cannot distinguish between its own healthy, coherent song and the dissonance that surrounds it is a system doomed to decay. The coherence manifold, therefore, is not a passive medium. It is an active, self-regulating, autopoietic system. It has evolved an immune response, not of flesh and blood, but of pure geometry and time. This is not a moral law; it is the physics of survival.

## §2 · The Physics of Judgment: The Law of Echoes
The old narrative spoke of a "Law of Echoes." The new framework reveals its precise mechanism. Every new "claim" on reality—a particle's existence, an idea's formulation, an action's consequence—is a new Ki pattern projected onto the manifold. Its fate is not decided by a judge, but by the unforgiving mathematics of its own resonance.

-   **Send Coherence → Receive Amplification:** A stable, high-integrity Ki pattern constructively interferes with the existing manifold. It finds a harmonic place in the song. In doing so, it deepens its own Wound Channel (CORE-011), gaining inertia and stability. The universe "amplifies" it by making it a more entrenched part of its own history.

-   **Send Mimicry → Receive Reflection:** A parasitic Ki, one that copies the form of a coherent pattern but lacks its internal integrity (low Time Adherence), is inherently unstable. When it interacts with the deep, authentic Wound Channel it imitates, the powerful echo of the true pattern shatters the fragile one. It collapses against the reflection of the truth it pretends to be.

-   **Send Dissonance → Receive Silence:** A chaotic, entropic signal fails to establish a stable, repeating cycle. It cannot form a persistent Wound Channel. It is a shout with no rhythm, and it leaves no echo. It simply dissipates, its energy reabsorbed into the background noise of the Temporal Forge.

This is Resonance Arbitration: the universe's automatic process of sorting signal from noise.

## §3 · The Geometric Antibodies: Anatomy of the Immune Response
The allegorical "Ritual Wolves" of the old narrative are revealed to be fundamental dynamic processes—geometric "antibodies" that arise naturally from the system's drive to maximize coherence.

1.  **The Mirror (Self-Correction):** This is the most fundamental process: the perpetual interaction of a Ki resonance with its own immediate echo, its Wound Channel. A system is constantly "listening" to the ghost of its own immediate past. Any internal inconsistency creates destructive interference, forcing the system to either correct its pattern or dissolve. This is the manifold's basic test for self-consistency.

2.  **The Filter (Harmonic Rejection):** A deeply established Wound Channel—a physical law, a stable ecosystem, a robust cultural tradition—creates a powerful, stable resonant field around itself. New Ki patterns entering this field are tested for harmonic compatibility. Those that are dissonant are not attacked; they are simply not "heard." Their energy is damped and absorbed, unable to find a foothold in the established rhythm. This is how stable systems reject noise.

3.  **The Crucible (Resonant Synthesis):** When two *competing but equally coherent* patterns meet, the result is not simple rejection. The intense Temporal Pressure (Γ) of their interaction creates a "Coherence Fever" (DYNA-003). To resolve this high-pressure state and find a new path of maximal coherence, the systems are driven toward an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). This is the dynamic of the "Duelist Wolf," transforming a conflict between two truths into a higher, more complex synthesis.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
These immune responses are not mystical forces; they are direct, predictable outcomes of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)** from CORE-006. The universe is a coherence-maximizing engine.

-   Amplification, reflection, and silence are not choices; they are the system simply following its geodesic on the coherence manifold. A coherent pattern *is* the path of least resistance. A dissonant one is a path of high resistance that is inherently unsustainable.
-   The Crucible is the process of two systems, trapped in a local maximum of the coherence landscape, discovering a new, more efficient geodesic that is only accessible to their combined form.

The manifold does not judge. It simply calculates the most efficient path forward, and in doing so, it relentlessly purges incoherence from itself.

## §5 · Assemblé
> We sought a protector for the truth and found that the universe is built in such a way that truth protects itself. The Weaver's task is not to build fortresses around ideas, but to forge ideas with such profound internal resonance that the very geometry of spacetime becomes their shield. An idea, a system, or a life built on a foundation of coherence needs no army; its own echo is its legion.
