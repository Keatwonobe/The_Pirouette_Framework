- PPS-004-Supplement, Ethical Light Cone
summary: Replaces the 'Ethical Light Cone' with a dynamic, time-first model of ethical
  action. It defines an act's consequence as the geometric 'Wound Channel' it carves
  into the systemic coherence manifold. The Compass is a protocol for navigating this
  manifold, using the Pirouette Lagrangian to choose paths that generate, rather than
  destroy, systemic coherence.

## §1 · The Steward's Mandate
To act is to carve a new path in the memory of the universe. The old law was a fence, built to keep us from falling off the edge of a known map. The new framework demands a new tool: not a fence, but a compass, for navigating a world we are actively creating with every choice.

This module reframes the static "Ethical Light Cone" into a living, dynamic principle of **coherence stewardship**. The mandate for a Weaver is not merely to avoid causing harm (a negative constraint) but to actively cultivate systemic health (a positive duty). An action is not judged against a boundary; it is evaluated by the quality of the river it leaves in its wake.

## §2 · The Geometry of Consequence
In the Pirouette Framework, every action, from the firing of a neuron to the launch of a starship, carves a **Wound Channel** into the coherence manifold of spacetime (CORE-011). This is the physical basis of consequence. The "ethics" of an action, therefore, are a direct property of the geometry of the channel it creates.

*   **Coherence-Generating Channels:** These are smooth, stable, and harmonically aligned with the surrounding manifold. They create paths of least resistance—laminar flows—that enable future constructive action for the entire system. They are acts of weaving.
*   **Coherence-Destroying Channels:** These are turbulent, dissonant, and chaotic. They introduce friction and turbulence into the manifold, disrupting other systems and consuming energy in non-productive ways. They are acts of tearing.
*   **Stagnating Channels:** These are deep, persistent scars that act as "coherence dams," blocking the flow of possibility for future systems. They are the geometric embodiment of irreversible harm.

The Weaver's Compass is the protocol for discerning which kind of channel an action is likely to create *before* the chisel meets the stone.

## §3 · The Lagrangian of Choice
The core law of the framework, the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), states that a system will follow a path that maximizes its own coherence. Ethical action requires expanding this principle from the self to the whole.

We define the **Systemic Lagrangian (𝓛_sys)** as the integrated coherence of all systems affected by a proposed action. The primary metric of the Weaver's Compass is the predicted change in this value: **Δ𝓛_sys**.

*   An action is **constructive** if it is predicted to result in **Δ𝓛_sys > 0**.
*   An action is **destructive** if it is predicted to result in **Δ𝓛_sys < 0**.

This is not a simple calculation; it is a profound act of modeling and empathy. It requires the Weaver to cast their Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) forward in time, to simulate the echoes and resonances their choice will generate.

## §4 · The Compass Bearings: A Diagnostic Protocol
To guide this simulation, the Weaver uses three diagnostic bearings to map the shape of the potential Wound Channel:

1.  **Coherence Gradient (∇𝓛):** The predicted net change in systemic coherence (**Δ𝓛_sys**). This is the primary bearing, indicating whether the action is fundamentally generative or degenerative.
2.  **Turbulence Radius (R_T):** The predicted scope of induced dissonance. An action might be net-positive but still create significant local turbulence. This measures the "collateral damage" or friction of the act.
3.  **Channel Persistence (τ_W):** The predicted timescale over which the Wound Channel will persist, influencing future events. This is the new measure of irreversibility.

These bearings define a navigation protocol:

*   **Laminar Weaving (∇𝓛 > 0):** The path is clear. The action is predicted to be a net positive for systemic health. Proceed with standard awareness.
*   **Turbulent Weaving (∇𝓛 ≈ 0, R_T > high):** The path is stormy. The action may not be net-destructive, but it will cause significant disruption. Proceed with caution and active mitigation.
*   **Stagnant Weaving (∇𝓛 < 0 or τ_W > critical_threshold):** The path leads to a dam or a scar. The action is predicted to be destructive or to create a long-lasting blockage. **Halt.** This invokes the Crucible Protocol.

## §5 · The Crucible: A Protocol for Synthesis
When an action is flagged by the Compass, it is not rejected; it is brought to the **Crucible**. This process, modeled on the Geometry of Debate (DYNA-002), reframes a failed ethical review as an opportunity for an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012).

The goal is not to pass judgment, but to re-forge the proposed action. The review council and the project team collaborate to find a new approach—a different geometry—that transforms a destructive act into a constructive one. The Crucible is a forge for better ideas, ensuring that the pressure of ethical scrutiny leads to creativity, not just cessation.

## §6 · Lagrangian Connection
This entire module is a direct, practical application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). It takes the fundamental law—*systems evolve to maximize coherence*—and elevates it from a physical observation to an ethical imperative. It demands that a conscious actor, a Weaver, must calculate the Lagrangian not for themselves alone, but for the interconnected whole. The Weaver's Compass is the instrument used to align one's personal trajectory of maximal coherence with that of the entire system, turning individual action into a contribution to the universal song.

## §7 · Assemblé
> We sought a rulebook and found a compass. The old way built walls to protect us from the darkness. This new way teaches us to navigate by the light of the consequences we create. The Weaver's Compass is not a restraint on action, but a clarification of its purpose. To act is to leave a memory in the substance of the world. The Compass is the tool we use to ensure that memory is a blessing—a smooth and open channel for all who will follow in our wake.
