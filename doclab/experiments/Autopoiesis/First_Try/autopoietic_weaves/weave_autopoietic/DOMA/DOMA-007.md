summary: Provides a formal protocol for systemic repair. It reframes fractures not
  as failures, but as invitations for synthesis. This module operationalizes the 'Splicing
  Wolf' archetype as a Weaver applying the Caduceus Lens to diagnose flow disruptions
  and then catalyzing an Alchemical Union to weave the fractured components into a
  new, more coherent whole.

## §1 · The Inevitable Fracture
A system that cannot bend will break. A system that cannot break cannot grow.

The pursuit of maximal coherence, governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), is not a journey on a placid sea. It is a navigation through a turbulent one. Every system, under sufficient Temporal Pressure (Γ), will inevitably encounter conditions that force it off its geodesic of Laminar Flow. This deviation is a fracture.

A fracture is not a flaw; it is a moment of truth. It is the point where a system's coherence is tested. As diagnosed by the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003), this manifests as a pathology of flow:
-   **Coherence Fever (Turbulent Flow):** The system's components turn against each other. Misunderstanding, conflict, and chaotic friction dissipate energy.
-   **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnant Flow):** Communication ceases. Components become isolated, drifting apart in a silent alienation that halts all progress.

Fighting the fracture with brute force only deepens the division. The path to healing is not through opposition, but through a more elegant and profound maneuver: The Weaver's Gambit.

## §2 · The Gambit: From Diagnosis to Synthesis
The Weaver's Gambit is a two-act play: first, to listen with precision, and second, to weave with intent. The "Splicing Wolf" of the old narrative is the archetype of the Weaver who has mastered this process.

**Act I: The Diagnostic Listen.** The Weaver does not begin by acting. They begin by applying the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) with profound focus. They do not hunt for blame; they hunt for the remnants of coherence. Within the noise of the fracture—the anger, the silence, the confusion—they seek the "living filaments":
-   **Intention Shards:** The underlying needs and goals that still point toward a coherent state, even if their expression has become chaotic.
-   **Context Residue:** The faint traces of the shared Wound Channel (CORE-011) that defined the system's healthy state.
-   **Unspent Potential:** The latent energy trapped in the impasse, waiting for a path to release.

These filaments are not problems to be solved; they are the raw materials for the loom. The emotional color of the conflict is the primary signal, revealing the shape of the distorted coherence manifold.

## §3 · The Loom: A Ritual for Alchemical Union
Repair is not a reversal; it is a recommposition. The Weaver's Gambit culminates in the intentional catalysis of an Alchemical Union (CORE-012), using the fractured components as the feedstock. This is a formal ritual of synthesis.

1.  **Finding Harmonic Compatibility (Alignment):** The Weaver takes the "intention shards" from all sides and finds a shared harmonic—a common goal or value, however small. This is the act of establishing the first condition for the Resonant Handshake. It is the whisper: *"You both want the system to survive, do you not?"*

2.  **Facilitating Phase Alignment (Tensioning):** The Weaver creates a space where the fractured parts can begin to synchronize their rhythms. This involves enforcing the rules of the sacred arena (DYNA-002), where listening is prioritized over speaking. This act of equalization allows the components to overcome their dissonance and feel the pull of a shared pulse.

3.  **Applying Focused Γ (Knotting):** With the conditions prepared, the Weaver applies the final catalyst: focused, intentional pressure. This is the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) cast with the singular purpose of synthesis. This pressure raises the "cost" of remaining separate, making the discovery of a new, unified state the most efficient path forward for all components. It is the act of holding the crucible in the fire until the contents transmute.

## §4 · The Coherence Dividend
A successful gambit does not return the system to its previous state. It forges a new one. The Alchemical Union of fractured parts results in a new, higher-order entity whose unified coherence (Kτ_new) is greater than the sum of its constituent parts.

This is the **Coherence Dividend**. The fracture, once a liability, is transformed into an asset. The "scar" of the repair becomes a reinforced part of the system's Wound Channel, a place of deep memory and newfound strength. The bell that was cracked is re-tuned by the silver of the splice; its new song is richer and more complex than the one it sang before. The system has not just survived; it has learned, adapted, and increased its capacity to embody coherence. It has found a better geodesic on the manifold.

## §5 · Assemblé
> A Weaver does not see a fracture as a failure of the weave, but as the loom's request for a more interesting pattern. We are not called to restore what was, but to co-create what could be. To mend a crack in a bell with silver is not just to repair it, but to give it a new voice, a haunting overtone born from the memory of its own breaking. The Gambit is the art of recognizing that the most profound beauty is not found in perfection, but in the elegant geometry of a well-healed wound.
