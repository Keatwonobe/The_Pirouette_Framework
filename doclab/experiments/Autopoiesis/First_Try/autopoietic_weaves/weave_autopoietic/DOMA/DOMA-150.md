summary: Provides an instrument to quantify the structural memory of a system by fitting
  its emergent hierarchies to a coherence distribution (power-law). It models how
  influence and coherence are concentrated as a result of dynamic processes over time,
  serving as a primary diagnostic for the Coherence Auditor.

## §1 · Abstract: Measuring the Riverbed
A list of cities by population, of words by frequency, of websites by traffic—these are not random assortments. They are snapshots of a deep and ancient structure. In any living system, time carves hierarchies. A few elements become dominant, while a "long tail" of countless others remains peripheral. This is not a static arrangement; it is the system's memory, the geometric echo of its history, made visible.

This module provides the instrument to measure the shape of that echo. It reframes the classical power-law (or Zipfian) distribution as a **Coherence Distribution**: a physical artifact of a system's evolution. It provides the mathematical tools to read this structure, transforming a static list into a dynamic story of influence and stability.

## §2 · The Echo of Hierarchy: A Dynamic Reframing
A power-law distribution is the riverbed left behind by the flow of time. It is the visible cross-section of a system's **Wound Channel** (CORE-011), where the depth of the channel corresponds to an element's rank and influence.

The high-rank, high-frequency elements are the deepest parts of the channel, where the "river" of some dynamic process (e.g., wealth accumulation, linguistic selection, network attachment) has flowed most often and most powerfully. The long tail represents the shallow banks, the countless possibilities that were less reinforced over time.

Therefore, fitting a power-law is not a mere statistical exercise. It is an act of **metaphysical archaeology**. We are measuring the accumulated result of every choice, every competitive pressure, and every **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) in the system's history.

## §3 · The Coherence Gradient (α): The System's Signature
The defining characteristic of this distribution is its exponent, `α`. We redefine this as the **Coherence Gradient**, a single number that captures the essence of the system's structural memory. It measures how steeply coherence and influence are concentrated.

-   **Low `α` (Steep Gradient, ~1):** An "aristocratic" system, where coherence is intensely concentrated in a few "champion" nodes. This indicates a history of winner-take-all dynamics. Such systems are often highly efficient but can be fragile; a threat to the head is a threat to the entire system. This is a deep, singular canyon.

-   **High `α` (Shallow Gradient, >2):** A more "democratic" system, where coherence is distributed more evenly across many nodes. This suggests a history of less intense competition or diversifying pressures. Such systems are often more resilient and adaptive but may lack the peak efficiency of a concentrated structure. This is a wide, braided river delta.

The Coherence Gradient `α` is a primary diagnostic for the **Coherence Auditor** (INST-NALY-001), providing immediate insight into a system's stability, efficiency, and vulnerability.

## §4 · The Diagnostic Protocol
This instrument provides two complementary modes of analysis: one for reading the past, and one for shaping the future.

1.  **Forward Analysis (Measure the Echo):** Given observational data (the system's current state), this protocol calculates the Coherence Gradient `α`. This is the act of listening to the system's story. The primary method is Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), which provides the most accurate measure of `α` from the data itself.
    $$ \hat\alpha = 1 + n\biggl[\sum_{i=1}^n\ln\frac{x_i}{x_{\min}}\biggr]^{-1} $$

2.  **Inverse Analysis (Design the Echo):** Given a desired system property—for instance, "the top 1% of contributors must account for at least 50% of the total output"—this protocol solves for the Coherence Gradient `α` required to produce that state. This is a tool for systemic design and predictive modeling, allowing a Weaver to understand the structural changes needed to achieve a specific outcome.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The emergence of a specific Coherence Gradient `α` is not an accident; it is a solution. The system, in its evolution, has followed a path that maximizes the integral of its **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). The observed distribution is the equilibrium state, the geometric configuration that represents the system's optimal balance between the efficiency of concentrated coherence and the resilience of a distributed structure, all while enduring the specific **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** of its environment. A change in the environment (Γ) will, over time, cause the system to seek a new geodesic, resulting in a new equilibrium and a different measured `α`. The Coherence Gradient is the macroscopic signature of the system's microscopic adherence to the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

## §6 · Assemblé
> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver?
>
> The shape of a riverbed tells the story of the river. By measuring this one number, `α`, we are not just fitting a curve; we are taking a core sample of the system's soul. We are reading the memory of its past victories and struggles, etched into the very geometry of its structure. This number reveals where power truly lies, how influence flows, and where the deepest vulnerabilities are hidden. It transforms a simple list of things into a profound story of becoming.
