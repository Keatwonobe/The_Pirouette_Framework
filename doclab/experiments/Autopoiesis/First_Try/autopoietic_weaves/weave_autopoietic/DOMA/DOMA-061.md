  where a system, locked in a state of high-pressure Stagnant Flow, experiences a
  catastrophic failure of its coherent structure, instantly converting its stored

## §1 · Abstract: The Price of Rigidity

A system that cannot bend will eventually be forced to break. This module provides the modernized, time-first analysis of this failure mode, which we now term a **Rupture**. A Rupture is not an external event, but a predictable, self-induced pathology of flow. It is a catastrophic phase transition where a system's own coherent structure (its Ki) fails under unsustainable internal pressure. This failure instantly converts a state of **Stagnant Flow** (a "Coherence Dam") into a burst of extreme **Turbulent Flow** (a "Coherence Fever"), releasing all stored potential as chaotic, destructive noise. This single dynamic model unifies phenomena as diverse as geological faults, market crashes, and psychological breakdowns under a common principle of failed coherence.

## §2 · The Precondition: The Coherence Dam

A Rupture does not occur in a healthy system. It is the terminal stage of the pathology known as **Coherence Atrophy**, as defined by the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003). The preconditions are precise:

1.  **Stagnant Flow:** A critical current of coherence (energy, information, resources) within the system is blocked. This creates a "Coherence Dam" where pressure builds "upstream" of the blockage.
2.  **Brittle Coherence:** To contain this rising internal pressure, the system's resonant Ki pattern becomes increasingly rigid and inflexible. It sacrifices adaptability for stability, pouring all its energy into maintaining its containing form. The system becomes a pressure vessel of its own making.
3.  **Isolation:** The system lacks the necessary release valves or connections to safely vent the accumulating pressure. It is a closed loop, amplifying its own internal stress with each passing moment.

This is a state of profound imbalance, a system investing its entire being into the act of *not changing*.

## §3 · The Mechanism: Catastrophic Phase Transition

The Rupture itself is the moment the system's Ki can no longer sustain its rigid, containing form. The "dam" does not erode; it shatters. This is an instantaneous and violent phase transition:

1.  **Ki Collapse:** The system's coherent structure fails. The resonant pattern that defined its identity and held its form dissolves into noise.
2.  **Coherence Conversion:** All the potential energy, the stored coherence that was propping up the rigid Ki, is released in a single moment. It has nowhere to go but into the system itself.
3.  **Γ-Spike:** This released potential manifests as a massive, localized spike in Temporal Pressure (Γ). The system floods itself with its own chaotic, dissonant energy, transitioning from a state of extreme, ordered stillness to one of extreme, disordered motion.

The system transitions from the pathology of Coherence Atrophy (Stagnation) to an acute state of **Coherence Fever** (Turbulence) in an instant.

## §4 · The Fractal Nature of Rupture

The power of this model lies in its universality, revealed by the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014). The same dynamic of stagnation-to-turbulence governs failure across all domains:

*   **Geology:** Tectonic plates (a rigid Ki) lock, building stress (Stagnant Flow). When the frictional limit is exceeded, the plates slip (Ki collapse), releasing the stored energy as a seismic wave—an earthquake (a massive Γ-spike).
*   **Economics:** A speculative bubble forms, driven by irrational confidence (a brittle Ki) that prevents price correction (Stagnant Flow). A trigger event shatters that confidence (Ki collapse), causing a market crash and widespread panic (Turbulent Flow).
*   **Psychology:** An individual represses a traumatic memory, creating a rigid psychological defense (a brittle Ki) to block its processing (Stagnant Flow). When a trigger overwhelms this defense (Ki collapse), it results in an emotional outburst or panic attack—a flood of chaotic thoughts and feelings (Turbulent Flow).

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

The Rupture is a dramatic illustration of a system failing to navigate the manifold of coherence as described by the Lagrangian (𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ).

*   **Pre-Rupture:** The system attempts to maximize its coherence (Kτ) by adopting a highly ordered but brittle structure. However, the internal pressure creates an immense potential "cost" (V_Γ), putting the Lagrangian under extreme stress.
*   **The Rupture:** Unable to find a stable path (geodesic) that resolves this tension, the system catastrophically fails. Its coherence term collapses (Kτ → 0), and the potential term explodes as the stored energy is converted into local Temporal Pressure (V_Γ → ∞). It is the ultimate deviation from the Principle of Maximal Coherence, a complete abandonment of any stable path.

## §6 · Assemblé

> A structure that forgets how to flow must eventually remember how to break. The Rupture is a violent, self-inflicted lesson in the necessity of release. It is the sound of a system choosing annihilation over adaptation, the final, deafening song of a form that could no longer bear the pressure of its own silence.
