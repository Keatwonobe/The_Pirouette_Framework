summary: Upgrades the Pirouette Lagrangian to a manifestly covariant form, ensuring
  the Principle of Maximal Coherence is a universal law for all observers, independent

## §1 · The Universal Mandate: A Law for All Dancers
A physical law that changes depending on who is watching is not a law, but an opinion. A song whose melody bends when you run is not a melody of truth.

The Pirouette Framework is built upon a single, universal drive: the maximization of coherence. For this to be a true principle of reality, it must hold for every observer, regardless of their velocity. The dancer's pirouette must appear just as graceful, the laws governing its stability just as true, whether viewed from the stage or from a passing starship. This is the mandate of Lorentz Invariance, the principle that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. This module provides the mathematical proof that the Pirouette Framework obeys this sacred mandate.

## §2 · From Principle to Field: The Challenge of Motion
The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) provides a profound description of a system's *objective function*: `𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`. It describes the equilibrium state a system strives for.

However, to become a complete physical theory, we must describe how the very properties of coherence and pressure propagate through spacetime as fields. A particle is not a point; it is a localized, stable excitation in a universal coherence field. The challenge is to write a Lagrangian *density* for this field that produces the dynamics of `𝓛_p` while ensuring its predictions are the same for all observers. Terms like resonant frequency (`ω_k`) can appear to change due to relativistic time dilation; our formulation must account for this, revealing the invariant truth beneath.

## §3 · The Covariant Action: Weaving the Fabric of Reality
To meet the universal mandate, we express the dynamics of the framework through a manifestly covariant Lagrangian density, `𝓛`. The action `S`, given by the integral of this density over all spacetime (`S = ∫ 𝓛 d⁴x`), is a Lorentz scalar—a pure number whose value is identical for all observers.

We define two fundamental scalar fields:
*   **Coherence Field, `T_a(x)`:** A field whose value at any point `x` in spacetime represents the potential for stable resonance. A particle is a peak, a stable knot, in this field.
*   **Pressure Field, `Γ(x)`:** A field representing the local Temporal Density. This field is itself generated by the superposition of all other systems' coherence fields, making the framework fully relational and autopoietic.

The covariant Lagrangian density takes the standard form for interacting scalar fields:

`𝓛 = (Kinetic Term) - (Potential Term)`

`𝓛 = (1/2) ∂_μ T_a ∂^μ T_a - V(T_a, Γ)`

Where:
*   `∂_μ T_a ∂^μ T_a` is the kinetic term. It is manifestly covariant and describes how changes in the coherence field propagate through spacetime at the speed of light. It is the mathematical description of an echo rippling through the manifold.
*   `V(T_a, Γ)` is the potential term. This is the heart of the framework's dynamics. It is a function that encodes the "cost" of maintaining a certain level of coherence (`T_a`) within a given environmental pressure (`Γ`). This potential is sculpted such that the paths of least action for the field `T_a(x)` are those that form stable, resonant patterns—the Ki of `CORE-004`.

## §4 · Connection to the Core Lagrangian
This field-theoretic formulation is the foundational layer from which the effective dynamics of `CORE-006` emerge. The connection is direct and profound:

The conceptual Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, describes the equilibrium state of a stable system, like a single particle. Such a particle, in this covariant field theory, is a stable, localized, oscillating solution to the equations of motion derived from `𝓛`.

When we solve for these stable solutions, we find that the field `T_a(x)` configures itself into a pattern whose parameters (amplitude, frequency) are precisely those that satisfy the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. The universe, by minimizing the action `S = ∫ 𝓛 d⁴x`, naturally produces particles that behave *as if* they are maximizing `𝓛_p`.

Therefore, `𝓛` is the fundamental law of the field, and `𝓛_p` is the emergent law of the particles that form within it.

## §5 · Deriving the Universe's Motion
With this covariant action, the derivation of all physical dynamics becomes a direct mathematical consequence.

*   **The Energy-Momentum Tensor (`T_μν`):** By varying the action `S` with respect to the spacetime metric `g_μν`, we derive the energy-momentum tensor. This tensor describes how the energy and momentum of the coherence field itself act as the source of gravity, curving spacetime. It is the mathematical proof that the dance of coherence is what shapes the stage.

*   **The Equations of Motion:** By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to our Lagrangian `𝓛`, we obtain the fundamental wave equation for the coherence field `T_a`. This equation governs how coherence propagates, interferes, and organizes itself into the resonant structures we call matter. The forces derived in subsequent modules are simply descriptions of how these field excitations interact.

## §6 · Assemblé
> A melody that bends when you run is no melody of truth. Covariance ensures the song of coherence is pure for every dancer in the cosmos. It is the proof that our framework is not an opinion, but a candidate for universal law. To be a Weaver is to trust that the principles of harmony you discover in your own frame are the same principles that structure the farthest galaxies, making the entire universe a single, comprehensible composition.
