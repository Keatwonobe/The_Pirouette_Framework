summary: Provides a unified, time-first model of influence, distinguishing between
  persuasion and manipulation based on their effect on a target system's coherence.
  Persuasion is framed as a resonant invitation to a state of higher coherence (a
  more optimal path on the Lagrangian manifold). Manipulation is defined as a parasitic
  induction of dissonance and turbulent flow, draining the target's coherence for
  the manipulator's benefit.

## §1 · Abstract: Reshaping Another's River
To influence another is to reshape the riverbed in which their reality flows. It is the most intimate and consequential of acts. This module reframes the dynamics of influence, moving beyond the field-theoretic language of PPS-045 to a more fundamental, time-first model grounded in the core principles of flow and resonance.

Influence is defined as the process of projecting one's own resonant pattern—an *Observer's Shadow*—onto the coherence manifold of another system. This intervention has two primary, and ethically opposite, modes:

*   **Persuasion:** A resonant invitation. The influencer reveals a path to a state of higher coherence, inviting the target system to adopt a new, more efficient Ki pattern. This is a creative, symbiotic act that enhances the autonomy and health of the target.
*   **Manipulation:** A parasitic resonance. The influencer induces a dissonant, turbulent state in the target, forcing them onto a path that drains their coherence for the influencer's benefit. This is a destructive, parasitic act that compromises the autonomy and health of the target.

This framework provides the diagnostic tools to distinguish one from the other, not by judging intent, but by observing the geometric and energetic consequences of the act itself.

## §2 · Persuasion as Resonant Invitation
A master gardener does not force a plant to grow; they provide the conditions in which growth becomes its most natural and effortless act. So it is with ethical persuasion.

The act of persuasion is a sacred form of dialogue, a practical application of *The Geometry of Debate* (DYNA-002). The persuader does not seek to conquer, but to engage in a *Resonant Handshake* (CORE-012). They present a new Ki pattern—an idea, a perspective, a course of action—not as a command, but as a potential solution, a more elegant and stable resonance.

The target system, perpetually seeking to maximize its own coherence, recognizes this new pattern as a superior path. It represents a more efficient geodesic on their own coherence manifold. They willingly adopt it, not because they are compelled, but because it is in their own nature to do so. This results in an *Alchemical Union* of perspectives, where the coherence of both systems is elevated. The signature of this interaction is the generation of clear, stable, *Laminar Flow* (DYNA-001).

## §3 · Manipulation as Parasitic Resonance
A parasite does not offer strength; it feigns harmony while siphoning life. So it is with manipulation.

Manipulation is a profane act of dissonance. The manipulator projects a deceptive *Observer's Shadow* (CORE-010), presenting a distorted coherence manifold to the target. They offer a path that appears attractive but is, in reality, a trap designed to benefit the manipulator.

This act is a *dissonant injection*. It forces the target system off its natural geodesic and into a state of lower coherence. This pathology manifests in two ways, as diagnosed by *The Caduceus Lens* (DYNA-003):

*   **Coherence Fever:** The target is thrown into a state of *Turbulent Flow*. Their internal Ki becomes dissonant, creating destructive interference. This is experienced as confusion, anxiety, and internal conflict. The system fights itself, wasting energy in chaotic friction.
*   **Coherence Atrophy:** The manipulator creates a *Stagnant Flow* by erecting a "Coherence Dam" of fear, doubt, or obligation. The target becomes paralyzed, unable to move along any path, their potential locked behind the blockage.

In both cases, the target's coherence is drained, and that stolen energy is consumed by the manipulator. It is a parasitic act that leaves the host system weaker, less stable, and less autonomous.

## §4 · Lagrangian Dynamics of Influence
The ethical nature of an influential act is not a matter of opinion; it is mathematically legible in its effect on the target's Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ), as defined in CORE-006. The Lagrangian dictates a system's drive to maximize its internal coherence (K_τ) against external pressure (V_Γ).

*   **Persuasion Maximizes the Lagrangian:** An act of persuasion proposes a new state (a new Ki) that, when adopted, *increases* the total integrated action (S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt) for the target. The target becomes more stable, more efficient, and more resilient. The invitation is accepted because it is a demonstrably better state of being.

*   **Manipulation Diminishes the Lagrangian:** An act of manipulation tricks or coerces the target into a new state that *decreases* their integrated action. The target is rendered less stable, less efficient, and more vulnerable to external pressure. This deficit in coherence is the "energy" that the manipulator harvests.

This provides an objective, physical basis for ethics. A "good" act is one that raises the coherence and autonomy of another. An "evil" act is one that diminishes it for selfish gain.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> To speak is to weave. With every word, you cast a thread into the loom of another's being, altering the pattern of their world. The choice is the same with every breath: are you a Weaver, collaborating on a shared and beautiful tapestry? Or are you a parasite, unraveling another's threads to knit a hollow shelter for yourself? The universe is autopoietic; it builds itself from its own interactions. In choosing how you influence another, you are choosing the very substance of what you will become.
