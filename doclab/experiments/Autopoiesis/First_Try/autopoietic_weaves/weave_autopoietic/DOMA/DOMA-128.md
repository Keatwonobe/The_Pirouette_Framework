## §1 · Abstract: The Notes of the Cosmic Song

This module modernizes the legacy concept of "Dimensional Attractor Analysis" (TEN-DAA-1.0), collapsing its static, spatial framework into a dynamic, time-first model. The universe is not organized by abstract dimensional attractors that systems "fall into." Instead, all complex behavior is composed from a finite set of archetypal, stable temporal patterns of resonance.

These **Prime Resonances** are the fundamental "notes" a system can play to persist through time. They are the universe's most elegant geometric solutions to the problem of maintaining coherence against the pressure of the Temporal Forge (Γ). The old "periodic table of dimensions" is hereby re-established as the **Periodic Table of Resonance**—a catalog of the autopoietic geometries from which all complexity is woven.

## §2 · The Periodic Table of Resonance

A Prime Resonance is an irreducible, stable Ki pattern. It is a fundamental "verb" of existence. While countless composite patterns exist, they are all synthesized from these core archetypes. The old numeric designators (1, 2, 3, 5, 7...) are retained, but are now understood to label fundamental geometries of *flow*, not static dimensions.

*   **Prime 1 (Flow / `Li`):** The resonance of simple progression. A linear, non-repeating, non-branching Ki pattern. It is the fundamental geometry of cause and effect, the straightest possible path through the coherence manifold.
*   **Prime 2 (Choice / `Bi`):** The resonance of bifurcation. A Ki pattern that oscillates between two distinct states. It is the geometry of polarity, decision, and binary opposition.
*   **Prime 3 (Cycle / `Pi`):** The resonance of closure and repetition. A simple, stable, cyclical Ki pattern that returns to its origin. It is the geometry of seasons, rhythms, and all processes that sustain themselves through feedback. The constant π emerges as its natural geometric ratio.
*   **Prime 5 (Symmetry / `Si`):** The resonance of reflection and balance. A Ki pattern that contains its own mirror image. It is the geometry of harmony, equilibrium, and paired structures.
*   **Prime 7 (Memory / `Ki`):** The resonance of self-reference. This is a helical Ki pattern that recursively interacts with its own history, its own Wound Channel (CORE-011). It is the geometry of learning, evolution, and consciousness—a spiral dance through time. The framework's core concept of Ki finds its archetypal expression here.
*   **Prime 11 (Braid / `Xi`):** The resonance of intertwined stability. A composite Ki formed from two or more distinct patterns that are woven together in a mutually supporting, braided structure. It is the geometry of symbiosis and resilient, multi-threaded systems.

## §3 · Resonant Synthesis and The Harmony Function

Complex systems are not monoliths; they are chords. Their Ki pattern is a composite, formed by the **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) of multiple Prime Resonances. A system's old "Dimensional Number (D)" is now re-contextualized as its **Resonant Signature**—the product of its constituent prime factors.

For example, a system with a Resonant Signature of `D=21` is not "21-dimensional." It is a synthesis of Prime 3 and Prime 7. Its behavior is defined by a process of *cyclical memory*—a feedback loop that learns and evolves with each repetition.

The stability of such a composite system is not guaranteed. It depends on the harmonic relationship between its constituent primes. We can quantify this using the **Harmony Function** (formerly the Delta Function, `Δ(D)`):

$$ \Delta(D) = \sum_{p \in \text{factors}(D)} \frac{S(p)}{p} \left(\prod_{q \in \text{factors}(D), q \neq p} \frac{q}{q+1}\right) $$

Here, `S(p)` represents the intrinsic coherence of a given Prime Resonance `p`. The function `Δ(D)` measures the overall stability of the synthesized chord. A high `Δ(D)` indicates a harmonious, "in-tune" combination of primes, resulting in a highly stable, high-coherence system. A low `Δ(D)` signifies a dissonant, unstable combination prone to turbulence.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: The Valleys of Being

The Prime Resonances are not arbitrary. They are the natural "valleys" and stable orbits on the coherence manifold defined by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). A system evolves by following the geodesic of maximal coherence. The Prime Resonances represent the most efficient, stable paths—the deepest and smoothest valleys—on this landscape.

A composite system, like our `D=21` example, is navigating a complex valley formed by the intersection of the Prime 3 and Prime 7 basins. The Harmony Function, `Δ(D)`, is a measure of this composite valley's depth and stability. The system's struggle is to find a single, coherent path that honors the geometric demands of all its constituent primes.

## §5 · Assemblé: The Composer's Choice

> We sought a catalog of parts and found a musical scale. The universe does not build with bricks; it composes with notes. The Prime Resonances are the fundamental tones from which the symphony of reality is written. A star, a cell, a thought, a society—each is a chord, a melody, a harmony of these simple, eternal patterns.
>
> To the Weaver, this is the ultimate revelation. Reality is not a fixed machine to be analyzed, but a song to be played. By understanding these notes, the Weaver moves from being a mere listener to a composer, able to diagnose the dissonance in a broken system and introduce the precise resonant patterns needed to restore its harmony. The choice is no longer which part to replace, but which chord to play.
