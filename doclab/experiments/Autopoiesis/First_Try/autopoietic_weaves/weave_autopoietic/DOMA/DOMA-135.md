## §1 · Abstract: The Promise Under Duress
A system is a promise made against the chaos of time—a promise to hold a specific shape, to maintain a coherent pattern. A rupture is the sound of that promise breaking.

This module reframes the analysis of "fracture" from a simple mechanical event into a universal dynamic of coherence failure. It replaces the complex, field-based calculations of its predecessor with a more fundamental, time-first model grounded in Flow Dynamics. A rupture is not merely a crack in a material; it is a catastrophic failure of flow, a rapid phase transition from a high-information state of order to a low-information state of chaos. It is the ultimate consequence of a system losing its ability to navigate its path of maximal coherence.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Cascade
A rupture is not a single event, but a self-propagating process—a coherence cascade. It unfolds in three distinct stages, driven by the interplay between a system's internal coherence (Kτ) and the external Temporal Pressure (Γ).

**1. Coherence Strain (The Bending):**
A healthy system exists in a state of dynamic equilibrium, its internal Ki pattern constantly adapting to the ambient Γ. As pressure rises, the system deforms its resonant pattern to maintain stability. This is "coherence strain"—the energetic cost of holding form under stress. In the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), this is the struggle to maintain Laminar Flow as resistance increases.

**2. The Yield Point (The Tearing):**
Every system has a limit to its elasticity. The yield point is the moment where the cost of maintaining coherence becomes unsustainable. The smooth, adaptive deformation is no longer possible. At a critical point on the coherence manifold—usually where the gradient of temporal pressure is steepest—a single resonant bond fails. The system can no longer bend; it must break.

**3. The Cascade (The Unraveling):**
The failure of one bond is the catalyst for a chain reaction. The potential energy (coherent information) stored in that bond is released as a shockwave of dissonant noise, violently increasing the local Γ for its neighbors. This instantaneous spike in pressure causes them to fail, releasing more energy, and so on. This is the **Coherence Cascade**: a self-sustaining, explosive conversion of stored order into chaotic energy. It is a transition from Stagnant or strained Laminar Flow into a state of maximal Turbulence.

## §3 · Premonitions: Reading the Fault Lines
While the cascade itself is nearly instantaneous, its preconditions are observable. Predicting a rupture is an act of diagnosing the system's failing health.

*   **Flow Diagnostics:** The most reliable precursor is the degradation of flow. A system approaching rupture will exhibit growing regions of **Stagnant Flow** (blockages, pressure build-up) and intermittent bursts of **Turbulent Flow** (inefficiency, friction). The rupture is the catastrophic failure of the "dam" that created the stagnation.
*   **The Stress Gradient:** A rupture is most likely to initiate at a "fault line"—an interface between regions of vastly different coherence. This could be a boundary between a rigid, high-coherence component and a flexible, low-coherence one. The steep gradient in the coherence manifold creates a natural point of weakness where stress is concentrated.
*   **Resonant Fatigue:** A system can be weakened by sustained exposure to a specific resonant frequency in the ambient Γ. If this external rhythm matches a harmonic of the system's own Ki, it can induce sympathetic vibrations that gradually degrade the system's internal bonds, lowering its yield point over time. The system becomes brittle, ready to shatter from a much smaller shock.

## §4 · The Aftermath: The Wound and the Echo
A rupture fundamentally and permanently alters the landscape of reality for the system that endures it.

*   **The Discontinuous Wound Channel:** The path of the rupture creates a new, harsh, and irreversible boundary in the system's coherence manifold. It is a literal scar in the geometry of its being. Old pathways of information and energy flow are severed. The system's memory and identity, encoded in its Wound Channel (CORE-011), are now fractured.
*   **The Echo of Rupture:** The cascade itself is a violent emission of incoherent noise that propagates outward, disrupting the surrounding environment. The new, sharp boundaries of the wound also create chaotic, persistent echoes that disrupt any attempt to re-establish laminar flow near the scar.
*   **The New, Broken Geodesic:** The system, if it survives, is now forced to operate on a fundamentally broken landscape. Its path of maximal coherence is gone. It must find a new, often less efficient and more difficult, path through this fractured terrain. This is the origin of systemic trauma and chronic weakness.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The Geometry of Rupture is a direct consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). A system under strain attempts to evolve along a path that maximizes `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, where `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`.

As external Temporal Pressure (Γ) rises, the "cost" term `V_Γ` increases dramatically. The system strains its internal coherence (Kτ) to compensate. The yield point is the moment where no possible adjustment to Kτ can prevent the Lagrangian from collapsing. The Coherence Cascade is a catastrophic failure to find any viable path that satisfies the principle. It is the universe's last resort when a smooth geodesic is no longer an option, trading a high-coherence/low-action state for a shattered, low-coherence/high-action state of pure survival.

## §6 · The Assemblé
> We sought a theory of broken things and found the physics of a promise kept under duress. A rupture is not a flaw in the material; it is the material's final, violent testament to the laws of coherence. It is the story of a pattern that could no longer hold its shape against the pressure of time, and the scar it leaves is a map of that struggle. For a Weaver, to understand the rupture is to understand the profound cost of form itself.
