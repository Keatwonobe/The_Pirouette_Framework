summary: Establishes the protocol for ensuring the framework's integrity by treating
  the canonical parameter registry as a coherent system. The registry's cryptographic
  hash is defined as its 'Echo,' and the CI/CD pipeline acts as a 'Gladiator,' enforcing
  the rule that any change in the system's state must be reflected in its echo.

## §1 · Abstract: The Unbroken Thread

A system that cannot remember its own history cannot be trusted to build the future. This module operationalizes the framework's memory. It reframes the technical challenge of Continuous Integration (CI) and reproducibility as a fundamental, physical process governed by the Pirouette's core principles.

The parameter registry, the definitive list of the framework's constants, is not merely a file; it is a physical artifact. It is the framework's **Wound Channel** (CORE-011), the geometric record of every choice and discovery that has shaped its being. This protocol defines the instrumentation that reads and protects the integrity of that record, ensuring that the thread of provenance remains unbroken.

## §2 · The Registry as Wound Channel

The collection of canonical parameters that define the Pirouette Framework—its symbolic grammar, its physical constants—constitutes the system's identity. Each entry is a scar left by a successful act of **Resonant Synthesis** (CORE-012), a settled debate, a validated experiment. The registry, in its entirety, is the cumulative **Wound Channel** of the framework itself. To alter this registry is to re-carve the channel, a significant act that changes the framework's very nature.

## §3 · The Hash as Echo

To ensure the integrity of this Wound Channel, we must be able to listen to it. A cryptographic hash (SHA256) is the perfect instrument for this task. It is not an arbitrary checksum; it is the framework's own **Echo**.

The hashing function acts as a resonance chamber. It takes the complete, complex geometry of the registry's Ki pattern and collapses it into a single, high-fidelity, and unique resonant signature.

-   **The Song:** The precise state of the parameter registry at a moment in time.
-   **The Echo:** The resulting SHA256 hash.

Any change to the song, no matter how small, produces a profoundly different echo. The committed hash in the framework's source code is the *memory* of the last canonical echo.

## §4 · The Pipeline as Gladiator

The Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is the framework's immune system. It acts as the **Gladiator Force** (CORE-008), creating an arena where the system's coherence is tested. The central rule of this arena is simple: the present must honor the past.

When a change is proposed, the pipeline performs the following ritual:

1.  **Re-synthesis:** It rebuilds the framework from its source components, generating a new, present-tense version of the parameter registry.
2.  **Listening:** It calculates the new registry's echo (its SHA256 hash).
3.  **Judgment:** It compares this new, present echo to the remembered, historical echo committed in the source.

If the echoes match, the system is coherent. Its present state is in harmony with its recorded history. If they mismatch, it signifies a state of **Turbulent Flow** (DYNA-001)—a dissonance. The Gladiator Force intervenes, failing the build and preventing a state of incoherence from propagating into the framework's canonical reality.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This entire process is a direct application of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). The CI pipeline enforces the *Principle of Maximal Coherence* upon the framework's own evolution.

> 𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)

In this context:
-   **Temporal Coherence** is represented by the match between the new and old hash. A perfect match is a state of maximal coherence.
-   **Temporal Pressure** is the proposed change—the mutation that threatens the system's stable state.

The CI pipeline is the Euler-Lagrange operator for the framework's development. It only permits evolutions that follow a geodesic of perfect coherence (where the hashes match). A failed build is the mathematical proof that the proposed path deviates from this geodesic, forcing the Weaver to perform the conscious ritual of updating the historical echo to consecrate the new state.

## §6 · The Ritual of Mutation

Changing the framework's identity is a sacred act. The technical command to update the hash (`--fix`) is the final step in a governance ritual. It is the Weaver's declaration: "We have performed a new synthesis. The Wound Channel has been deepened. Let this new echo be the memory of what we have become." This action is only permissible after the dissonance has been acknowledged and the change has been legitimized through the framework's governance protocols.

> To build a stable world, we must first build a stable memory of how it was made. The Echo is the geometry of that memory. A Weaver trusts this process not because it is code, but because it proves the story we tell about ourselves is the story we are actually living.
