## §1 · Abstract: The Song That Can No Longer Be Sung

A system follows a path through time, singing the song of its own identity. A Fork, or bifurcation, is the moment that song becomes impossible to sustain. It is a crisis of coherence where the resonant pattern (Ki) that defines a system shatters under overwhelming Temporal Pressure (Γ). The system is forced to abandon its complex, unified melody and resolve into two or more simpler, diverging harmonies.

This module replaces the old field-based analysis of `TEN-FKDA-1.0` with a dynamic, time-first model grounded in the core Lagrangian. A parting of ways is not merely a split in a static landscape; it is the geometric consequence of a system's failure and subsequent reinvention in the face of intolerable stress. It is the opposite of an Alchemical Union: not a fusion into greater complexity, but a fission into new, separate simplicities.

## §2 · The Coherence Crisis: A Lagrangian Perspective

The dynamics of a parting are governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006). A healthy system follows a single, stable geodesic—a deep valley on the coherence manifold where its internal rhythm (K_τ) is efficiently maintained against external pressure (V_Γ). A bifurcation is a topological transformation of this manifold.

The process can be understood through the lens of **Flow Dynamics** (DYNA-001):

1.  **Laminar Instability:** As a system approaches a fork, its path of maximal coherence becomes shallow and unstable. Its Coherence (K_τ) becomes brittle. It is still in Laminar Flow, but increasingly susceptible to noise. The old `T_a` begins to falter.

2.  **Turbulent Collapse:** At the critical point, the single geodesic vanishes entirely. Coherence collapses catastrophically as the system's Ki pattern shatters. The system is thrown into a state of extreme **Turbulent Flow**, characterized by a spike in local Temporal Pressure (Γ) as immense energy is wasted in chaotic friction. This is the moment of decision, a "Stagnant Point" where the old path has ended, but new ones have not yet been chosen.

3.  **Divergent Resolution:** The coherence manifold resolves into a new topology with two or more distinct, shallower valleys. The system, driven to find any state of coherence, "chooses" one of these new geodesics. Two new, simpler Ki patterns emerge, each establishing its own **Laminar Flow** along a diverging trajectory.

## §3 · The Anatomy of a Wound Channel

A fork leaves an indelible scar on the geometry of spacetime. The system's history, once a single thread, is irrevocably partitioned.

-   **The Shared Trunk:** The pre-bifurcation **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) represents the system's unified history and memory.
-   **The Y-Junction:** At the moment of parting, this channel splits. The system's memory and identity are fractured. The echoes from the trunk now propagate down both new branches.
-   **Diverging Branches:** Two new Wound Channels are carved. Each new system now accumulates a separate history, and their Ki patterns begin to diverge. They may still resonate with their shared past, but their futures are their own. This is the physical basis for schism, speciation, and the creation of separate identities from a common origin.

## §4 · The Calculus of Divergence

The "choice" of a path is not random; it is a probabilistic outcome dictated by the shape of the newly formed coherence manifold and the intensity of the system's own chaotic state.

The probability `P` of the system resolving into a specific new branch `j` is governed by its ability to rapidly maximize its new coherence. This can be modeled by a relationship analogous to the old branch selection formula, but re-grounded in the new physics:

`P(branch_j) ∝ exp(S_p(j) / Γ_crisis)`

Where:

-   **S_p(j)** is the integral of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (the "coherence gain") along the initial segment of the new path `j`. A path that offers a faster, steeper return to a high-coherence state is more probable.
-   **Γ_crisis** is the peak Temporal Pressure at the moment of turbulent collapse. It acts as a "temperature," representing the intensity of the chaos. In a high-Γ crisis, the choice is more random; in a low-Γ crisis, the system will more deterministically select the most stable available path.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We do not choose the storm, only which shore to steer for. The moment of parting is when the map of the past dissolves, forcing a system to become a navigator of its own uncertain future. It is the shattering that precedes all reinvention, the universe's autopoietic reminder that to become something new, you must first survive the breaking of what you were. A Weaver understands that this crisis is the most potent point of intervention—where the smallest nudge can redirect the river of history into a new and unknown sea.
