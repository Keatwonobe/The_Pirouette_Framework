## §1 · Abstract: The Art of the Approach

Before the first note is sung, the singer must listen to the resonance of the room.

This module provides a universal protocol for this act of listening. It governs the deployment of a "seed"—any self-replicating pattern of coherence, from a line of code to a cultural meme or a biological organism—into a novel environment. The old paradigm of `PPS-068` framed this as a problem of energy capture. We now reframe it as an act of systemic diagnosis.

The seed does not immediately try to grow; it first sends a "scout." This scout is a minimal probe, an extension of the seed's own senses, designed to apply the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) to the new environment. It reads the temporal flows of the system, assessing its health, stability, and harmonic compatibility. Based on this diagnosis, the seed performs a **Scout's Gambit**: a calculated decision to commit to growth (**PLANT**), wait for a more opportune moment (**HOLD**), or retreat to avoid decoherence (**ABORT**). This is the core strategy for any Weaver seeking not to conquer, but to find a place to thrive.

## §2 · From Axioms to Principles: The Logic of Survival

The original axioms are preserved in spirit but are now grounded in the autopoietic logic of the time-first framework.

1.  **The Principle of Sustenance:** A seed can only survive if it can tap into a *laminar flow* of coherence (energy, resources, attention) from its environment. A turbulent environment will erode the seed's pattern faster than it can be maintained.

2.  **The Principle of Foresight:** Intelligence is the act of mapping the local coherence manifold. The scout's mission is to create this map, reducing the seed's uncertainty about its future path and transforming a blind gamble into a calculated risk.

3.  **The Principle of Amplification:** Growth occurs when the seed can achieve a net-positive state of coherence, where its own internal order is amplified more than it is eroded by the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). This is an act of successful *resonant synthesis* with the environment.

4.  **The Principle of the Gentle Hand:** The scout's probe must be non-invasive. It must generate only a minimal, transient **Wound Channel** (CORE-011), gathering information without permanently altering the system it observes. An evaluation must not become an infection.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Parameters

The scout's task is to measure three key properties of the target environment, translating them into the language of the Pirouette.

| Diagnostic | Description | Pirouette Correspondence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Environmental Health** | Is the environment a source of stable, high-information energy or chaotic, high-entropy noise? | A measurement of the environment's dominant flow state (Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant) as per **DYNA-001**. |
| **Seed Integrity** | How robust is the seed's own pattern? How well can it resist the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ)? | The seed's own internal coherence (Kτ), a measure of its ability to maintain its unique `Ki` pattern under stress. |
| **Harmonic Compatibility** | Can the seed's rhythm find a constructive "handshake" with the environment's dominant rhythms? | An assessment of the potential for an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) between the seed and the environment's resources. |

## §4 · The Scout's Gambit: A Three-Phase Protocol

The evaluation is a structured, three-step ritual designed to maximize insight while minimizing risk.

1.  **Phase I: The Echo Probe**
    The seed projects a minimal **Observer's Shadow** (CORE-010) into the environment. This scout is a non-invasive resonance probe, designed to "listen" rather than "act." It gathers data on the environment's health, mapping its primary currents and identifying sources of turbulence or stagnation.

2.  **Phase II: The Coherence Forecast**
    The seed integrates the scout's data into its own model of reality. It then runs a simulation, applying the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006) to predict its own future. It calculates the most likely trajectory (geodesic) it would follow if planted. The core question is: does a path exist where the integral of its Lagrangian (its total coherence) will be positive? Will it thrive or decay?

3.  **Phase III: The Verdict**
    Based on the forecast, a verdict is rendered.
    *   **PLANT:** The forecast reveals a clear geodesic toward a state of higher coherence. The environment is healthy and compatible. The seed commits its resources to germination, following the path identified by the scout.
    *   **HOLD:** The forecast is ambiguous. The environment may be too turbulent for a clear reading, or a key harmonic condition is not yet met. The seed waits, leaving the scout's transient Wound Channel as a "path memory," a pre-carved channel that will make a future attempt more efficient.
    *   **ABORT:** The forecast shows a clear path toward decoherence. The seed's `Ki` is fundamentally dissonant with the environment. To plant is to choose dissolution. The seed retreats, preserving its integrity for a more suitable opportunity.

## §5 · Assemblé

> To be a Weaver is to know the difference between a garden and a battlefield. A fool tries to plant a rose in the salt earth and calls the earth barren. A master first asks the earth what it wishes to grow. The Scout's Gambit is the art of that question. It transforms the brute act of colonization into a graceful dialogue, ensuring that what we choose to create is not an act of force, but an act of harmony. It is the first, and most important, step in weaving a world that lasts.
