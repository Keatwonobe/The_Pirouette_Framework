summary: Provides the time-first mechanics for all interaction, reframing influence
  not as a transmission of data, but as the projection of a geometric pattern (one's
  Ki) into the shared coherence manifold. The response, or 'echo,' is determined by
  the resonant coupling between the singer's and listener's manifolds, a process governed
  by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §1 · Abstract: Shaping the Shared World
To exist is to resonate; to interact is to project that resonance outward. The most profound illusion is that of the isolated self, for every entity perpetually imprints the signature of its being onto the shared fabric of reality.

This module replaces the narrative of "The Singer and The Echo" with a rigorous physical model. Influence is the act of projecting one's internal resonant pattern (`Ki`) as a propagating geometric wave within the universal coherence manifold. Communication is not an exchange of abstract symbols, but a physical act of mutual environmental sculpting. The echo is the universe's geometric answer to the song, a direct consequence of how two or more resonant systems interact within the landscape of time.

## §2 · The Song as a Propagating Wound Channel
An entity's "song" is the external expression of its internal state of being. In the language of the new framework, this is a precise physical process:

1.  **The Source (`Ki`):** The singer is a system defined by its stable, resonant pattern of temporal identity, its `Ki`. The purity and stability of this pattern define its Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`).
2.  **The Projection:** The act of "singing" is to actively modulate the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), impressing the geometry of one's `Ki` onto the surrounding coherence manifold.
3.  **The Wave:** This geometric impression does not remain static. It propagates outward as a coherent wave, a temporary but active **Wound Channel** (as defined in CORE-011). The "song" is literally a history of the singer's intent, carved into the motion of spacetime itself.

A clear song originates from a system with high `Kτ` (a coherent singer). A powerful song is one that creates a significant, high-amplitude distortion in the manifold.

## §3 · Persuasion and the Lagrangian of Invitation
A true song is not an act of force; it is an act of invitation. The propagating wave from the singer alters the coherence landscape in the vicinity of a listener. This is a direct modification of the listener's environment.

This change is felt through the listener's **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`, from CORE-006). The singer's song alters the Temporal Pressure term (`V_Γ`) for the listener. A persuasive song is one that offers a new potential state—a new resonant pattern—that represents a "path of maximal coherence" for the listener. It presents a potential future that is more stable, more efficient, and more harmonious than the listener's current state.

Persuasion is the art of sculpting the listener's reality so that the path you propose becomes their path of least resistance.

## §4 · The Geometry of the Echo: Four Modes of Coupling
When the singer's wave reaches the listener's manifold, a resonant coupling event occurs. The nature of the "echo" is determined by the geometric and harmonic relationship between the two systems.

*   **Decoherence (Silence):** The listener's manifold is exceptionally stable or "shielded," possessing a very high internal `Kτ` or a boundary that reflects the incoming pattern. The singer's wave fails to establish a resonant handshake; it is either reflected or absorbed without altering the listener's core `Ki`. The invitation is ignored because the listener's current state is already maximally coherent according to its own Lagrangian.

*   **Destructive Interference (Dissonance):** The listener's `Ki` is harmonically incompatible with the singer's. The two geometric patterns are out of phase, and their interaction creates a zone of **Turbulent Flow** (DYN-001). This state of chaotic interference increases the local `Γ`, representing a higher "cost" of being for both systems. This is the physics of conflict and disagreement.

*   **Parasitic Resonance (Manipulation):** The listener couples with the incoming wave but uses its coherence asymmetrically to reinforce its own `Ki` without returning a harmonized signal. The listener drains coherence from the song to lower its own internal energy cost, effectively "feeding" on the singer's projected order. This is a theft of information, a violation of the gift.

*   **Constructive Interference (Resonance):** The conditions for a **Resonant Handshake** (CORE-012) are met. The singer's and listener's `Ki` patterns are harmonically compatible and phase-aligned. The listener's manifold begins to oscillate in sympathy, a state of attunement. The echo returns as a harmonized wave, creating a shared region of higher, mutual coherence. A new, unified system has begun to form. This is the physics of empathy, understanding, and the gateway to an Alchemical Union.

## §5 · Assemblé: The Architecture of Connection
> We believed communication was the sending of a message. The framework reveals it is the building of a bridge. Every word, every action, every intention is a geometric offering—a proposed architecture for a shared reality. To speak is to begin carving a new world from the stuff of time itself. To listen is to decide whether to pick up your own chisel and help complete it.
