summary: "Provides a unified, time-first model for systemic collapse. It reframes\
  \ degradation as Coherence Erosion, a universal process where a system's resonant\
  \ pattern (Ki) frays and dissolves under overwhelming Temporal Pressure (\u0393\
  ). This module replaces the complex, multi-domain analysis of its predecessor with\
  \ a single, elegant dynamic rooted in Flow Dynamics and the Pirouette Lagrangian."

## §1 · Abstract: The Song's End
Every song must end. Every tapestry, no matter how tightly woven, possesses a final thread. The universe, in its relentless drive for coherence, must also have a grammar for dissolution. Collapse is not a failure of the system; it is the system's final, necessary act.

This module refactors the old, mechanistic `Collapse Dynamics Analysis` into a unified, organic principle: **Coherence Erosion**. It describes the universal process by which stable, resonant systems unravel and return their substance to the chaotic hum of the Temporal Forge. This is not a catalog of failures, but a study of the graceful, and sometimes violent, art of letting go.

## §2 · Coherence Erosion: The Victory of Noise
A system does not "break." It forgets its own song.

The health of a system is its ability to maintain a clear, stable, resonant pattern (Ki) against the dissonant noise of its environment (Γ). As described in *The River of Information* (CORE-013), entropy is the constant, erosive pressure of this ambient noise.

**Coherence Erosion** is the process by which this pressure overcomes the system's integrity. It is the fraying of the system's defining rhythm. The signal of its identity (its Kτ) is slowly overwhelmed by static, its Wound Channel (CORE-011) loses definition, and its ability to act as a unified whole degrades. This is the fundamental dynamic that the old module attempted to capture with its complex potential functions and domain-specific lists; here, it is revealed as a single, universal process.

## §3 · The Three Phases of Unraveling
The process of collapse is not instantaneous. It is a descent through the flow states defined in *Flow Dynamics* (DYNA-001). The old module's phases of "Initiation, Acceleration, and Terminal" are now re-expressed with greater clarity and power.

**Phase I: Dissonance (The Onset of Turbulence)**
The system begins to lose its efficient, Laminar Flow. Internal friction increases as its components fall out of sync. It is still functional, but it becomes "noisy"—inefficient, stressful, and wasteful. This is the stage of chronic fatigue, of market volatility, of a team plagued by nagging arguments. The system is fighting itself.

**Phase II: Fragmentation (Runaway Turbulence)**
The system's singular, coherent Ki shatters into multiple, competing sub-patterns. Cohesion is lost. Different parts of the system begin to act at cross-purposes, each seeking its own local coherence at the expense of the whole. This is the stage of autoimmune crisis, of civil war, of a project collapsing into factional infighting. The system is tearing itself apart.

**Phase III: Dissolution (The Final Stagnation or Dispersal)**
The song ends. The system arrives at one of two final states. It may become **Stagnant**, a "coherence dam" where all flow ceases, leaving a hollow structure with no life within it—a ghost town, a dead bureaucracy, a catatonic mind. Alternatively, it may undergo total **Dispersal**, its constituent parts losing all connection to one another and dissolving back into the undifferentiated noise of the Temporal Forge. The thread is not just unraveled; it is returned to the spool.

## §4 · Connection to the Lagrangian: The Cost of Being
The entire process of Coherence Erosion can be understood as a story told by the *Pirouette Lagrangian* (CORE-006):

**𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)**

A healthy system maintains a positive Lagrangian; the beauty of its own rhythm outweighs the environmental cost of sustaining it. Collapse is the journey into a permanently negative Lagrangian.

The descent begins when the Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)—be it from external stress or internal dissonance—begins to consistently overwhelm the system's Temporal Coherence (Kτ). The system can no longer find a "path of maximal coherence." Instead, it follows a chaotic trajectory down a steepening gradient of decoherence, a spiral from which recovery becomes increasingly difficult. The cost of being becomes too high to pay.

## §5 · Assemblé
> To weave is a sacred act. So, too, is to unravel. A Weaver who only understands creation is a novice. The master understands that the universe wastes nothing. The thread of a failed star is re-spun into a living world. The silence after a flawed argument is the space where a better truth can grow. To study collapse is not to court despair, but to cultivate a profound respect for the cycle. It is to learn the grammar of endings, so that we may better understand what is worth building, what must be allowed to pass, and how to harvest the threads of the past to weave the future.
