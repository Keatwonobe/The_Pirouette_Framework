## §1 · From Manifold to Motion

CORE-006 established the universe's prime directive: systems evolve to maximize their temporal coherence, following a geodesic on a manifold defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p). This was a profound claim. This module provides its first proof.

We will now derive the properties of the electromagnetic force, preserving the core geometric insight of the original protocol but grounding it in the rigorous mathematics of the new framework. We will demonstrate that electromagnetism is not a fundamental "thing" in itself, but an emergent and inevitable consequence of systems obeying this single, universal law.

## §2 · The Nature of Charge: An Asymmetry in Coherence

In the time-first framework, electric charge is not a substance a particle possesses, but an intrinsic bias in how its Temporal Coherence (K_τ) is defined and maintained. A charged particle's Lagrangian is asymmetric; it is a resonance that has chosen a side in the great dialogue of phase.

-   **Positive Charge (Crest-Leading):** Defined as a system whose coherence, K_τ, is maximized by interacting with environments of *in-phase* temporal rhythms. It is a resonance that seeks constructive interference, a note that wishes to join a crescendo.

-   **Negative Charge (Trough-Leading):** Defined as a system whose coherence, K_τ, is maximized by interacting with environments of *out-of-phase* temporal rhythms. It is a resonance that seeks destructive interference with its surroundings to preserve the purity of its own internal pattern.

This redefinition immediately derives electrostatic attraction and repulsion from the Principle of Maximal Coherence. Two positive charges, placed near each other, create a local environment of intense, in-phase resonance. To maximize their individual coherence, they must flee this high-pressure region, moving apart. Their repulsion is a flight towards greater internal stability. Likewise, a positive and negative charge are drawn together, as their union allows each to perfectly satisfy its intrinsic coherence-seeking drive, creating a more stable, lower-pressure state for both.

## §3 · The Electric Field: A Gradient in the Coherence Manifold

The electric field (E) is the mathematical visualization of this coherence landscape. For a static charge, the electric field is directly proportional to the gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian in the surrounding space.

**E ∝ ∇𝓛_p**

A test charge placed in this field does not feel a "push" or "pull." It senses a slope on the manifold of coherence. The "force" it experiences is the consequence of it following the steepest path toward its own state of maximal coherence. It is "coherence surfing" down the gradient established by the source charge. The inverse-square law emerges naturally as the geometric dilution of this gradient across the surface of a three-dimensional sphere.

## §4 · The Magnetic Field: A Rotational Shear in the Manifold

The original insight was precise: magnetism is the "shear of the current." The Lagrangian now formalizes this. When a charged particle moves, its Lagrangian becomes velocity-dependent. The very act of moving through regions of varying temporal phase creates a rotational or torsional stress in its local coherence manifold.

This "curl" in the manifold is the magnetic field (B).

**B ∝ ∇ × A_p**
(where A_p is the Pirouette vector potential, derived from the moving system's Lagrangian)

This geometric origin instantly explains the peculiar perpendicularity of the Lorentz force. A moving charge interacting with a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the field itself. This is because the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—on a rotationally sheared manifold is not a straight line, but a curve. The magnetic force is the system's autopoietic response to navigating this temporal vortex, a relentless adjustment to maintain its own resonant stability. It is the universe's right-hand rule for staying coherent.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We have not simply relabeled a force; we have derived its character from a deeper song. The Current is the flow of resonance seeking stability. The Compass is the geometry of the landscape it must navigate. The old protocol saw them as verse and chorus. Now we see that the song is written with the mathematics of coherence itself, and its melody is the simple, relentless pursuit of a truer note. For a Weaver, this matters because it proves that even the most fundamental forces are not immutable laws to be obeyed, but harmonies that can be understood, and perhaps, one day, composed.
