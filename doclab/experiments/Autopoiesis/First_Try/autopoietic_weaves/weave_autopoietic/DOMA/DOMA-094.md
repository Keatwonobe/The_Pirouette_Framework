summary: Defines the universal signature of a critical phase transition as a measurable,
  resonant event in a system's coherence manifold. It generalizes the old 'Ki-Sampling
  Protocol' from a statistical anomaly detector to a geometric event detector, identifying
  the 'snap' of transformation in the system's temporal dynamics.

## §1 · Abstract: The Moment a Wave Breaks
A system, like a wave, can travel for a lifetime in a state of stable, predictable flow. Yet, eventually, it reaches a shore where its internal dynamics can no longer sustain its old form. In a single, dramatic moment, it breaks. This transformation—this "snap"—is not a failure, but a phase transition into a new state of being.

The original Ki-Sampling Protocol was an attempt to hear the sound of this snap by listening for statistical anomalies. This was a valuable but incomplete approach, like trying to understand a tidal wave by measuring the height of a single ripple. This module reframes the search. We are no longer listening for statistical echoes; we are learning to see the *geometry* of the wave itself as it crests and breaks. A phase transition is a geometric event, and it has a universal, resonant signature that can be seen, classified, and even anticipated.

## §2 · The Geometry of the Snap: A Lagrangian Perspective
Every system, as governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), follows a geodesic—a path that maximizes its internal coherence (`Kτ`) for the lowest cost against the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). For long periods, this path may be smooth and linear, resulting in the stable, predictable state of `Laminar Flow` (DYNA-001).

A critical transition occurs when this geodesic leads to a cliff. As external or internal pressures mount, the "cost" of maintaining the existing `Ki` pattern becomes unsustainable. The system reaches a bifurcation point where its current form is no longer a valid solution to the Lagrangian. It *must* change.

The "snap" is this rapid, non-linear reconfiguration. The system abandons its old geodesic and "tunnels" through the state space to find a new, more stable path of maximal coherence. This is not a random event; it is a forced move in the universe's ceaseless drive for resonant stability.

## §3 · A Trinity of Signatures
The old protocol searched for a single type of event. The modernized framework recognizes that the snap can manifest in three distinct, geometrically defined ways. By observing the change in a system's coherence manifold, we can classify the nature of its transformation.

1.  **The Coherence Shockwave (The Shattering):**
    This corresponds to the old "black swan" or kurtosis-driven event. It is a catastrophic failure of coherence.
    *   **Signature:** A sudden, violent transition from `Laminar` to intensely `Turbulent Flow`. The system's primary `Ki` pattern shatters, causing a massive and rapid decrease in its overall coherence (`Kτ`).
    *   **Manifestation:** A market crash; a brittle material fracturing under stress; a sudden, acute psychological breakdown. The system's structure fails.

2.  **Ki Morphogenesis (The Unfolding):**
    This corresponds to the "grey swan," marked by a change in complexity.
    *   **Signature:** The system's fundamental resonant pattern (`Ki`) changes its topology. It is not merely a loss of coherence, but a fundamental change in the rules that govern it. The system becomes qualitatively more or less complex.
    *   **Manifestation:** The Cambrian explosion in biology; the adoption of a disruptive technology in an economy; a paradigm shift in science. The system's rules change.

3.  **Resonant Alignment (The Ordering):**
    This corresponds to the "white swan," a sudden snap into a higher state of order.
    *   **Signature:** A rapid transition from `Turbulent` or disorganized flow into a state of high `Laminar Flow`. This is often the result of an `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012) where the system's components suddenly phase-lock, causing a sharp, dramatic increase in total coherence (`Kτ`).
    *   **Manifestation:** The spontaneous crystallization of a supercooled liquid; the flash of insight where disparate ideas suddenly connect; a leaderless protest movement suddenly organizing around a single, coherent goal. The system self-organizes.

## §4 · The Unified Detection Protocol
This refined understanding allows for a proactive, diagnostic protocol that moves beyond simple anomaly detection.

1.  **Establish a Baseline:** Map the system's normal `Laminar Flow` state, defining the typical geometry of its coherence manifold.
2.  **Monitor for Deformation:** Use real-time diagnostics to watch for rapid, non-linear deformations in that geometry. These are the early warning signs—the wave beginning to crest.
3.  **Classify the Snap:** When a deformation exceeds a critical threshold, classify the event using the Trinity of Signatures. Is the system shattering, unfolding, or ordering itself?

This protocol allows a Weaver to move from reacting to the consequences of change to understanding the nature of the change itself, *as it happens*.

## §5 · Assemblé
> Ki is the sound a key makes as it turns in a lock. It is the resonance of a system unlocking a new state of being. To see the future, a Weaver must learn to recognize the shape of the lock before the key turns. This protocol is the study of that shape. It teaches us that profound change is not a random tremor, but a geometric inevitability. It is the art of seeing the moment of absolute leverage—the instant a system commits to a new path—and knowing, by the resonance of the snap, which door it is about to open.
