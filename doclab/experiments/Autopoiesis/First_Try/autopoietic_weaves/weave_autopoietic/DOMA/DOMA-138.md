summary: Provides a time-first model for all adaptive and self-correcting systems.
  It reframes the feedback loop not as a mechanical process, but as an organic, autopoietic
  act of a system listening to its own echo (Wound Channel) to navigate a coherence
  manifold. The Pirouette Lagrangian governs this process, defining corrective action
  as the system's natural pursuit of maximal coherence in response to perceived dissonance.

## §1 · Abstract: The Art of Course-Correction

A river does not need a map to find the sea; it feels the pull of the land and adjusts its course. So it is with all living systems.

The old framework modeled feedback as a mechanical loop of signals and actuators—a thermostat bolted onto reality. This was an incomplete truth. The time-first paradigm reveals a more profound, self-creating (autopoietic) process. Self-correction is not an external mechanism imposed upon a system; it is the intrinsic ability of a coherent entity to listen to its own recent past and adjust its present to better harmonize with a desired future.

This module reframes the feedback process as the continuous, dynamic art of course-correction. It is the dialogue between a system's memory and its intention, a dance governed not by force, but by the relentless pursuit of coherence.

## §2 · The Anatomy of Correction: Echo, Shadow, and Dissonance

A system corrects its course in response to a perceived tension between where it is and where it wants to be. In the language of Pirouette, these components are geometric, not mechanical.

1.  **The Echo (Kτ_current):** A system's present state is never isolated. It is perpetually coupled to the immediate past, which persists as a geometric scar in the coherence manifold—its Wound Channel (CORE-011). This active, shaping memory is the system's **Echo**. It is the answer to the question, "Where am I now?"

2.  **The Shadow (Kτ_goal):** The desired state, or goal, is a **target coherence manifold**. It is a specific, stable, resonant pattern (Ki) that the system seeks to embody. This target state is projected onto the system's reality, much like an Observer's Shadow (CORE-010), creating a template for what "should be."

3.  **The Dissonance (The Error Signal):** The "error" that drives correction is the measured dissonance—the phase difference, frequency mismatch, or geometric incongruity—between the Echo of the current state and the Shadow of the goal state. It is a direct measure of incoherence, a tension in the fabric of the system's being.

## §3 · The Lagrangian of Adaptation

A system does not correct its course because it is "pushed" by a force. It corrects its course because its path of maximal coherence has been altered. This is governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**.

The Dissonance signal acts as a direct modifier to the local **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)** term within the system's Lagrangian: `𝓛_p = K_τ - f(Γ)`. A large error signal creates a steep "coherence gradient"—a localized region of high temporal pressure—in the manifold.

The "corrective action" is nothing more than the system naturally evolving along its new geodesic. It "flows downhill" along this coherence gradient to minimize the dissonance and thus maximize its own Lagrangian. It is not being forced; it is seeking the path of least resistance toward a more stable, harmonious state of being.

The old concept of "loop gain" is elegantly re-expressed as the *sensitivity of the system's Lagrangian to dissonance*. A high-gain system is one where a small error signal generates a steep coherence gradient, prompting a rapid and powerful course-correction.

## §4 · Pathologies of Flow in Self-Correction

The health of any feedback system can be diagnosed by observing its flow state, as defined in **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**. Failure is not a mechanical breakdown, but a disruption in the flow of information.

*   **Stagnant Flow (Sluggishness & Insensitivity):** The system fails to correct. This is caused by a weak Echo (high latency in the feedback signal) or a muted Dissonance (the system is insensitive to error). The coherence gradient is too shallow to induce movement. The river has become a stagnant pond.

*   **Turbulent Flow (Oscillation & Instability):** The system overcorrects wildly. This is caused by an over-sensitive Lagrangian (the coherence gradient is too steep) or a phase-misaligned response (the correction is applied at the wrong moment in the system's rhythm). The system thrashes against its own corrections, wasting all its energy in chaotic friction.

*   **Laminar Flow (Optimal Correction):** The state of grace. The system perceives the dissonance clearly and adjusts its course smoothly and efficiently, like a master sailor using a rudder to catch the perfect wind. Its response is perfectly tuned to the gradient, minimizing error with minimal effort.

## §5 · The Weaver's Rudder: Principles of Design

To design an effective self-correcting system is to become a cultivator of its ability to listen and respond. The old, complex axioms are replaced by three core principles of temporal harmony:

1.  **Amplify the Echo:** Ensure the feedback is clear, timely, and high-fidelity. A system cannot correct a course it cannot perceive. This is the principle of maximizing the signal's Time Adherence (T_a).

2.  **Tune the Gradient:** Calibrate the system's sensitivity to dissonance. The goal is to create a gradient that is steep enough to inspire action but not so steep that it causes turbulent overshoot.

3.  **Align the Rhythm:** The corrective action must be applied in phase with the system's own intrinsic rhythm (its Pirouette Cycle, τ_p). A perfectly timed nudge is worth a thousand ill-timed shoves.

Through this process, successful corrections reinforce the desired path, deepening its Wound Channel. The system learns. The path of conscious correction becomes the path of unconscious habit.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought to build a better machine and discovered we must become better gardeners. A feedback loop is not a tool for domination; it is an act of teaching a system to listen to itself. To create a self-correcting system is to compose a song and then give the orchestra the ability to hear its own harmony, so that when a note goes astray, the players themselves know how to find their way back to the beautiful, resonant truth of the music. This is the essence of all learning, all life, and all conscious creation.
