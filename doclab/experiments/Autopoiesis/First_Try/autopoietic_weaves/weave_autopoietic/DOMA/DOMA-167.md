## §1 · Abstract: From Map to Compass

A plan is not a map of a pre-existing territory. It is the architect's blueprint for a cathedral that does not yet exist. It is an act of will, a projection of coherence into the unwritten future.

The previous model, Planning Resonance Analysis, viewed a plan as a "forward wound channel," a static structure to be evaluated. This module reframes the entire concept through a time-first lens. A plan is a *dynamic hypothesis*. It is a proposed **geodesic**—a path of maximal coherence—that an entity intends to follow through the manifold of spacetime. Its success is not measured by adherence to the plan, but by its ability to generate and sustain a state of **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001) during its execution.

## §2 · The Plan as a Coherence Field

To analyze a plan, we model it as a localized, self-creating field of intent, governed by the same principles as any physical system. We can therefore describe it with its own speculative Lagrangian.

*   **Intent (Kτ_plan):** This is the "kinetic" term of the plan. It represents the internal coherence of the proposed actions. A plan with a clear objective, logically consistent steps, aligned resources, and unified stakeholder will has a high Kτ. It is a sharp, focused, and powerful signal of intent. This replaces the old `T_a_plan`.

*   **Friction (V_Γ_env):** This is the "potential" term. It represents the anticipated Temporal Pressure (Γ) of the environment—the chaos, uncertainty, competition, and resistance the plan will encounter. A plan that requires navigating a highly volatile market or overcoming a deeply entrenched competitor faces a high V_Γ. This is the anticipated "cost" of execution.

A viable plan is one that proposes a path where the coherence of Intent (Kτ_plan) is sufficient to overcome the anticipated Friction (V_Γ_env).

## §3 · The Forward Geodesic: Pre-Carving the Manifold

In the new framework, a Wound Channel (CORE-011) is a geometric scar left by the *past*. A plan is the audacious attempt to carve such a channel into the *future*.

This act of **geodesic projection** is a conscious attempt to impose a desired geometry onto the local coherence manifold. A powerful plan—one with high Kτ and a clever path through V_Γ—makes its own execution the path of least resistance. It "pre-carves" the riverbed, so that when the time comes to act, the water of reality naturally flows along the intended course. This is why a brilliant strategy, once set in motion, can feel effortless and inevitable.

## §4 · Diagnostics of Execution: The Flow States of a Plan

The ultimate test of a plan is not in its design, but in its execution. The "12 Resonant Planning Dimensions" are obsolete, replaced by the far more elegant and universal diagnostic lens of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001). The state of the plan-in-motion reveals its true nature:

*   **Laminar Flow:** The plan is succeeding. The proposed geodesic aligns with the actual manifold of reality. Actions are efficient, progress is steady, and goals are met with a sense of grace. The system is in a state of high coherence.

*   **Turbulent Flow:** The plan is struggling. The proposed path is dissonant with reality, leading to constant crises, wasted energy, and firefighting. This is the signature of a plan built on flawed assumptions, encountering a higher-than-expected V_Γ.

*   **Stagnant Flow:** The plan has failed. A critical blockage—a false assumption, a missing resource, an insurmountable obstacle—has been hit. The "Coherence Dam" has formed, and the geodesic is terminated.

## §5 · Lagrangian Connection

The Architecture of Intent directly operationalizes the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)** as a tool for strategic foresight. A plan is a speculative calculation of a future path that intends to maximize the integral of 𝓛_p over time.

The process of planning becomes an optimization problem: finding the sequence of actions (a proposed Kτ) that will most effectively navigate the landscape of anticipated environmental pressures (V_Γ). The "best" plan is the one whose projected geodesic is most likely to result in a sustained state of Laminar Flow, representing the actual path of maximal coherence.

## §6 · The Assemblé

> We once saw planning as drawing a line on a map. We now understand it as teaching a river a new song. The plan is the melody; the world is the water. A masterful plan does not force the river to bend; it sings a song so beautiful that the river yearns to follow. A Weaver does not command the future. They compose for it.
