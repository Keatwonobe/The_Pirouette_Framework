## §1 · Abstract: The Physics of Movement

This module reframes the study of human migration, moving beyond simple push-pull economics to model it as a fundamental physical process. Migration is the movement of a coherent system—a population—along a geodesic on a manifold defined by socio-geographic conditions. Populations do not simply react to scarcity; they are drawn by the universal imperative to maximize their own coherence, following the path of least resistance toward states of greater stability, opportunity, and resonance. This "time-first" model provides a more profound and predictive lens for understanding the great movements that shape our world.

## §2 · The Landscape of Coherence

The old model's "Migration Potential Field" is now understood as the landscape defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`), where a population's "action" is its struggle to exist. The gradients on this landscape are the true drivers of movement.

*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** This is the "push" factor, the ambient chaos and dissonance a population must endure. It is a measure of the temporal friction that degrades a society's health. High pressure zones are characterized by economic instability, political oppression, environmental collapse, and social fragmentation. They are regions of `Turbulent Flow` (DYNA-001) where life is unpredictable and costly to maintain.

*   **Potential Coherence (Kτ):** This is the "pull" factor, the promise of a more ordered and resonant existence. It is the measure of opportunity—for safety, economic stability, self-expression, and community. These are regions where a population perceives it can achieve a state of `Laminar Flow`, where its internal rhythm (`Ki`) can flourish with minimal interference.

A population does not calculate these factors consciously; it *feels* the gradient. The collective urge to migrate is the felt sense of a steeper, more favorable path towards coherence elsewhere.

## §3 · Dynamics of the Current

Migration is the flow of a population's coherence across this landscape, governed by fundamental principles of the framework.

*   **The Geodesic Path:** The trajectory of a migration flow is the population following the geodesic that maximizes the integral of its own Lagrangian (`S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`), as defined in CORE-006. This is the mathematical formalization of the "path of least resistance." The population moves to the place where it can be *most itself* for the *lowest cost* in temporal stress.

*   **The Gladiator Force of Borders (Γ_border):** Borders, whether physical walls or labyrinthine bureaucracies, are a manifestation of the Gladiator Force (CORE-008). They are intentionally constructed arenas of extreme, localized Temporal Pressure, designed to halt or filter the flow of coherence. Overcoming this barrier requires an immense expenditure of a population's own internal coherence and resources.

*   **Wound Channels:** Established migration routes are vast, societal-scale Wound Channels (CORE-011). Carved into the socio-geographic manifold by the passage of previous generations, these channels are persistent geometric features. They are conduits of information, trust, and shared culture that dramatically lower the pressure required for future movement. To follow a Wound Channel is to travel a path already proven to lead toward a state of higher coherence.

## §4 · The Alchemical Union of Integration

The process previously modeled as "assimilation" is now understood as a potential Alchemical Union (CORE-012), a profound act of social synthesis.

*   **The Resonant Handshake:** For integration to occur, the migrant population (`Ki_migrant`) and the host population (`Ki_host`) must achieve a "resonant handshake." This requires harmonic compatibility (shared values, economic symbiosis) and phase alignment (communication, cultural exchange).

*   **Synthesis vs. Turbulence:** If the handshake is successful, the two systems can merge their coherence manifolds to form a new, more complex, and often more resilient socio-cultural entity (`Ki_new`). This is the birth of a vibrant, integrated society. If the handshake fails due to extreme dissonance, the result is `Turbulent Flow`: social friction, ghettoization, and conflict, where both communities expend vast energy resisting one another.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We sought a model of human movement and found the physics of hope. Migration is not an anomaly to be managed; it is the universe's fundamental law of coherence-seeking, written in the script of human lives. A population moves for the same reason a river flows or a plant grows toward the sun: because the path toward less chaos and greater potential is the only path there is. A Weaver learns to read this landscape not to build higher walls, but to understand the currents that make us all one.
