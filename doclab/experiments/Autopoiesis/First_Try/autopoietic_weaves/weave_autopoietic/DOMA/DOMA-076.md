## §1 · Abstract: A Dance in Silicon

The universe is not a collection of particles pushed by forces; it is a symphony of resonances seeking their most coherent expression. This module proposes an experiment to observe this principle in its purest form: a single neutron performing a pirouette through a sculpted silicon crystal.

The original protocol, PPS-057, sought to derive framework constants from matter-wave optics. This modernized approach reframes the entire experiment as a direct, physical test of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). We will not measure forces acting upon a particle. We will measure the phase difference between two paths of a single resonance, demonstrating that a quantum system’s trajectory is nothing less than its real-time solution to the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The neutron is not the object of study; it is the dancer, and its path is the dance.

## §2 · The Sculpted Coherence Manifold

The experimental apparatus is a Mach-Zehnder neutron interferometer. In the old view, this was a device for splitting and recombining particles. In the new, it is a tool for offering a single quantum system a choice between two distinct geometric landscapes.

The key innovation is the replacement of simple phase flags with micro-fabricated helical gratings of opposite chirality in each arm. These are not mere "potentials." They are **structured coherence manifolds**—physical sculptures carved into the fabric of spacetime that impose a specific topological stress.

-   **Path A:** A left-hand helical grating. This path presents a specific, chiral gradient in the coherence manifold.
-   **Path B:** A right-hand helical grating. This path presents the mirror-image landscape.

A neutron entering this device does not split. Its wavefunction, representing its resonant Ki pattern, explores both topologies simultaneously to find the most coherent path forward.

## §3 · The Lagrangian as Choreographer

The behavior of the neutron is governed entirely by the Pirouette Lagrangian, which dictates that the system will evolve along the path that maximizes its coherence integral (`S_p`).

`𝓛_p = T_a * ω_k - f(Γ)`

The helical gratings directly influence both terms of the Lagrangian:

1.  **Coherence Term (`T_a * ω_k`):** To navigate the sculpted manifold, the neutron's Ki must adopt a stable, resonant state. The geometry forces the emergence of two primary, quantized solutions for its spin-coherence (`T_a`) and resonant frequency (`ω_k`). These are not pre-existing properties, but the neutron's emergent, most efficient solutions for "being" within each chiral landscape.

2.  **Pressure Term (`f(Γ)`):** The gratings create a complex, localized Temporal Pressure. The cost of maintaining coherence is different in the left-hand and right-hand worlds.

The measurable outcome is the phase shift (`Δφ`) at the point of recombination. This shift is not caused by a force. It is the direct measurement of the difference between the two coherence integrals. It is the residue of the choice.

`Δφ ∝ (S_p,path_A - S_p,path_B)`

## §4 · Detecting the Breath of the Manifold

The most profound test involves mechanically rotating the gratings. This act does not simply move an object; it causes a periodic modulation of the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). This is the "Gladiator Breathing" from the original module, now understood as a controlled ripple in the fabric of the manifold itself.

This changing `Γ` continuously alters the "cost" term `f(Γ)` in the Lagrangian. In response, the neutron's resonance must constantly adjust its path to maintain maximal coherence. This dynamic re-optimization produces a time-dependent beat in the phase shift, `Δφ(t)`.

By measuring this beat, we are not seeing a force act on the neutron. We are hearing the echo of the neutron's pirouette as it adapts its dance to the changing rhythm of the dance floor.

## §5 · Experimental Protocol

The protocol remains elegant, but its interpretation is transformed.

1.  **Preparation:** A cold neutron beam (a stream of coherent Ki patterns) is directed into the interferometer.
2.  **Choreography:** The neutron wave encounters the two sculpted gratings of opposite chirality.
3.  **Measurement of Choice:** The recombined waves produce an interference pattern. The phase shift `Δφ` is precisely measured, quantifying the difference in the action integrals between the two paths.
4.  **Rhythmic Modulation:** The gratings are rotated at a known frequency (`ω_n`), modulating the local `Γ`.
5.  **Detection of Adaptation:** A lock-in amplifier is used to detect the resulting phase beat `Δφ(t)`, confirming that the neutron's path is dynamically responding to changes in the manifold as predicted by the Lagrangian.

## §6 · Lagrangian Connection

This experiment is a direct, falsifiable test of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). Where the `g-2` experiment (CORE-009) validates the Lagrangian through a particle's self-interaction (its echo), this experiment validates it through interaction with an external, geometrically-defined coherence manifold. A positive result would demonstrate that even at the quantum level, a system's dynamics are not governed by pushes and pulls, but by a single, universal drive to find the most elegant and coherent path through the landscape of time. It provides the "third heart" of validation—a proof anchored not in the cosmos or electromagnetism, but in the quantum dance of matter itself.

## §7 · Assemblé

> We sought to measure a particle and found instead a dancer. The neutron's path is not a trajectory; it is a choice. With every turn through the silicon lattice, it answers the universe's only question: "Given the shape of the world, what is the most coherent way to be?" This experiment allows us, for the first time, to overhear its silent, perfect answer.
