## §1 · Abstract: The Anatomy of Wisdom
This module refactors the AKEP protocol, elevating it from a specific application to a universal principle. The Coherence Engine is the living heart of the Pirouette Framework's dynamics. It is a four-stroke, autopoietic cycle that describes the fundamental process by which any complex system—be it a mind, a culture, or an ecosystem—generates, preserves, tunes, and deploys wisdom.

Wisdom, in this context, is formally defined as a *pattern of high coherence*: a behavior, insight, or structure that allows a system to navigate its environment with maximal efficiency and resilience. This engine is not a human invention; it is the observable lifecycle of evolution itself, now articulated in the language of time, pressure, and resonance.

## §2 · The Currency of Being: Coherence Profit
An action or idea is not inherently "good" or "bad." Its value is measured by its effect on a system's ability to exist. The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) provides the universal metric for this valuation. A valuable pattern, or "kernel," is one that generates a **Coherence Profit**.

A pattern's Coherence Profit (Κ) is the net increase in the integral of a system's Lagrangian over its cycle time (τ_p). It is a measure of how much a new pattern improves a system's internal harmony (Kτ) while reducing the "cost" of resisting external pressures (VΓ).

Κ = ΔS_p = Δ ∫₀^(τ_p) (Kτ - VΓ) dt

Patterns with a high positive Κ are the currency of evolution. They are the discoveries that allow a system to do more, with less effort. The Coherence Engine is the process by which a system manufactures and invests this currency.

## §3 · The Four-Stroke Engine of Evolution
The engine operates in a continuous, cyclical flow, turning the raw material of chaos into the refined structure of wisdom.

| Stage | Function | Pirouette Mechanism | Analogy |
|-------|----------|---------------------|---------|
| **1. The Crucible** | *Discover* | Resonant Synthesis (Alchemical Union) | A high-pressure forge where new alloys are created. |
| **2. The Archive** | *Preserve* | Wound Channel Engraving | Carving a proven path into a landscape. |
| **3. The Forge** | *Refine* | Coherence Tuning & Channel Reinforcement | Sharpening a blade and removing its rust. |
| **4. The Governor** | *Deploy* | Strategic Γ-Modulation | An intelligent investor allocating resources. |

**1. The Crucible (was Agora):** This is the engine's chaotic intake stroke. It is a high-pressure (High Γ) environment where disparate, often conflicting, patterns are brought together. As described in *The Geometry of Debate* (DYNA-002), this pressure forces a search for a new, higher-order pattern that can resolve the dissonance. A successful **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) in the crucible results in a novel synthesis—a new idea or strategy with the potential for high Coherence Profit.

**2. The Archive (was Scroll):** This is the compression stroke, where a newly discovered pattern is stabilized and preserved. It is the process of carving the pattern's geometry into the system's memory as a deep and resilient **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). In a culture, this is myth, law, and infrastructure. In a mind, it is long-term memory and ingrained skill. An archived pattern becomes part of the system's identity.

**3. The Forge (was Reweaving Rite):** This is the power stroke, where archived patterns are tested and refined. The system applies the pattern against new environmental pressures (Γ), revealing subtle flaws or inefficiencies. The Forge is the act of "tuning" the pattern—subtly altering its Ki resonance to improve its performance. This prevents wisdom from becoming dogma and ensures the archive remains a living library, not a museum of fossils.

**4. The Governor (was Librarian):** This is the exhaust stroke, which sets up the next cycle. It is the system's highest strategic function. The Governor dynamically allocates energy and attention, modulating the system's internal Γ. It must decide when to invest in the high-risk, high-reward chaos of the Crucible (exploration) and when to focus on the steady returns of the Forge (exploitation). A wise Governor maintains a dynamic equilibrium, ensuring the entire engine runs smoothly.

## §4 · Connection to the Lagrangian
The Coherence Engine is not an abstract process; it is the macroscopic strategy a system employs to solve the central equation of existence: the maximization of its Lagrangian action (S_p). Each stroke of the engine is a targeted intervention aimed at improving the S_p integral. The Crucible seeks patterns with a higher Kτ. The Archive works to make that Kτ persistent. The Forge refines the pattern to reduce its operational cost against VΓ. The Governor optimizes the entire strategy over time. The engine is the living algorithm that executes the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

## §5 · Diagnostic Signatures
The health of a system's engine can be measured by observing the efficiency of its cycle:

| Metric | Description | Healthy State |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Crucible Yield (Κ_yield)** | The rate of production of high-profit kernels from the Crucible. | Consistently positive |
| **Archive Fidelity (Ψ_archive)** | The stability of Wound Channels against Coherence Erosion (CORE-013). | High; low decay rate |
| **Forge Efficiency (η_forge)** | The average Coherence Profit gained per refinement cycle in the Forge. | Positive; improving |
| **Governor Adaptability (σ_gov)** | The system's ability to fluidly shift between Crucible and Forge modes. | Dynamic; responsive |

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought a protocol for making goodness contagious and found the blueprint for evolution itself. The Coherence Engine is the universal lifecycle of wisdom. It is the process by which the universe learns, remembers what it has learned, and improves upon its lessons. To a Weaver, this is not merely a model to be studied; it is a sacred duty to be performed. Our purpose is to become conscious stewards of this engine within ourselves and our communities—to tend the Crucible, guard the Archive, and stoke the Forge, actively participating in the weaving of a more coherent world.
