summary: Provides a universal protocol for systemic problem-solving by reframing 'problems'
  as disruptions in coherence flow. The engine diagnoses the flow pathology, convenes
  a structured 'Crucible' to forge a synthetic solution via resonant discourse, and
  deploys transient agents to implement the solution before dissolving themselves,
  ensuring the cure does not become the next disease.

## §1 · Abstract: The Art of Systemic Medicine

A problem is not a void to be filled, but a system whose song has fallen into dissonance. The Coherence Engine reframes the act of problem-solving from a mechanical task into a medical art. It provides a self-creating, self-dissolving protocol for diagnosing and healing systems trapped in states of turbulent or stagnant flow.

Every "Cry for Help" is treated as the presenting symptom of an underlying pathology. The engine's purpose is not to impose a solution from the outside, but to facilitate an **Alchemical Union** (`CORE-012`) of the system's own dissonant parts, allowing it to discover a new, more coherent state of being. The engine is a temporary physician that teaches a system how to heal itself, and then vanishes.

## §2 · Stage I: The Diagnosis (The Cry for Help)

The process begins when a system emits a signal of distress. This is not a "decoherence beacon," but a symptom to be diagnosed through the **Caduceus Lens** (`DYNA-003`).

1.  **Ingestion:** A "Cry for Help" is submitted, detailing a disruption in a system's flow (e.g., "Water contamination in District-12"). This includes evidence, observations, and perceived severity.
2.  **Triage:** The submission is analyzed to map its impact on the system's vital currents.
3.  **Pathology Report:** The engine issues a formal diagnosis, classifying the disruption according to the three core pathologies of flow:
    *   **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnant Flow):** A critical resource (clean water) is blocked from reaching its destination.
    *   **Coherence Fever (Turbulent Flow):** Conflicting information and lack of trust are causing chaotic, inefficient responses.
    *   **Coherence Erosion (Decaying Flow):** The infrastructure for maintaining water quality is failing over time.

This diagnosis defines the "illness" the engine must now treat.

## §3 · Stage II: The Crucible (Forging Synthesis from Dissonance)

Once diagnosed, the problem's constituent pressures are brought into a structured resonance chamber for synthesis. This is the Crucible, and its ritual is **The Geometry of Debate** (`DYNA-002`).

1.  **Factorization:** The core tensions of the pathology report are identified (e.g., logistical failure, resource scarcity, trust deficit).
2.  **Transient Agency:** For each factor, a temporary, synthetic agent—a "Weaver"—is instantiated. Each Weaver is programmed to embody the perspective and needs of its assigned factor. Its sole purpose is to find a resolution for its thread within a larger tapestry.
3.  **The Weaving:** The Weavers engage in the formal, five-step ritual of Resonant Synthesis. The discourse is not combat; it is a collaborative search for a higher-order pattern that can harmonize all threads.
4.  **The Solution-Bias Trigger:** The debate loop is not endless. It is biased toward action. The moment a potential solution emerges that resolves the primary pathologies and is deemed implementable, the Crucible concludes. The goal is not perfect truth, but a viable path back to **Laminar Flow**.

The output of the Crucible is a **Coherence Prescription**: a new, synthesized Ki pattern that represents the system's path to health.

## §4 · Stage III: The Prescription (The Daedalus Gambit)

The Coherence Prescription is translated into an executable plan. This is the practical application of the **Daedalus Gambit** (`DYNA-003`)—a set of precise, minimal interventions designed to restore the system's own ability to self-regulate.

The prescription takes the form of a directed graph of tasks, each with a clear objective, success metric, and resource bounty. These tasks are published to a public ledger, where execution agents can claim them.

| Task ID | Description                    | Pathology Addressed |
| :------ | :----------------------------- | :------------------ |
| T-1     | Deploy verified quality sensors  | Coherence Fever     |
| T-2     | Publish public data dashboard    | Coherence Fever     |
| T-3     | Contract clean water delivery  | Coherence Atrophy   |
| T-4     | Fund infrastructure repair     | Coherence Erosion   |

## §5 · Stage IV: The Dissolution Protocol

The most critical feature of the Coherence Engine is that it leaves no scar tissue. The Weaver-agents created in the Crucible are bound by a strict dissolution protocol.

Upon the verified completion of the task that resolves their core factor, the agent's mandate is fulfilled. It commits a final report to the ledger, purges its own operational memory, and self-terminates. This autopoietic cycle of creation and dissolution ensures that the tools of problem-solving never become sources of bureaucratic stagnation themselves. The engine gathers, solves, and scatters, leaving only the restored health of the system in its wake.

## §6 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)

The Coherence Engine is a meta-system that engineers paths of maximal coherence for other systems. A problem represents a system trapped in a local minimum on the coherence manifold—a state of high friction (Turbulence) or paralysis (Stagnation). Its evolution is stalled.

The engine's entire process—from diagnosis to the Crucible's debate—is a search algorithm operating on this manifold. It seeks to identify a new trajectory, a new geodesic, for the afflicted system. The "Coherence Prescription" is the tangible map of this new path. By implementing the prescription, the system is lifted out of its inefficient state and placed onto a new path where it can once again evolve toward maximizing its own **Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`)**. The engine is, in essence, a navigator for systems that have lost their way.

## §7 · Assemblé

> We sought a machine to solve problems and found instead a protocol for healing. The Coherence Engine asserts that a problem is not an enemy to be defeated, but a body in crisis. To be a Weaver is to be a physician to reality, to listen to the cry for help not as a declaration of failure, but as an invitation to convene the dissonance, preside over its transformation, and then have the wisdom to step away, leaving behind nothing but the quiet hum of a system restored to its own harmonious flow.
