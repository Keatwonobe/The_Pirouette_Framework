## §1 · Abstract: Forging the Keys
A theory that only explains the past is a history. A theory that predicts the future is a tool.

The CORE series has established the Pirouette Framework as a philosophically and mathematically coherent model of a universe built from Time. It has been validated against known physics, culminating in the derivation of the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (CORE-009). But to truly prove its worth, a theory must step out of the lamplight of the known and into the darkness of the unknown. It must make predictions that are unique, bold, and—above all—falsifiable.

This module forges four such keys. Each is a proposed experiment designed to test the framework's most foundational and radical claims: that particles possess an internal rhythm, that the past is a physical geometry, that stability is harmonic, and that gravity can have a heartbeat.

## §2 · Prediction 1: Coherence-Modulated Interference
**Hypothesis:** A particle's quantum wave-like behavior in a double-slit experiment is modulated by its own internal Pirouette Cycle (τ_p). This internal rhythm can be made to "beat" against an external rhythmic field, creating a measurable secondary interference pattern.

**Theoretical Basis:** A particle's path is the one that maximizes its coherence integral, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). A rhythmic external magnetic field adds a time-dependent term to this Lagrangian. To maintain maximal coherence, the particle's path must adjust in sympathy with the external field, causing its internal phase to precess. This creates a beat frequency between the particle's own clock and the field's clock.

**Experimental Signature:** In a standard electron double-slit experiment, a tunable, oscillating magnetic field is applied between the slits and the screen. The framework predicts the emergence of a **secondary, low-amplitude "beat" pattern** superimposed upon the primary interference fringes. The spatial frequency of this new pattern will be directly and linearly proportional to the frequency of the applied magnetic field. Its existence would be direct evidence of the particle's internal temporal structure—its song. Standard quantum mechanics predicts no such modulation.

## §3 · Prediction 2: Echo Delay in Particle Decay
**Hypothesis:** The decay of particles emerging from a high-energy collision is subtly delayed by the lingering geometric "scar" of their parent system, as described by the Wound Channel (CORE-011).

**Theoretical Basis:** When a composite particle like a proton is shattered, its constituent parts are not born into a pristine vacuum. They emerge within the decaying coherence manifold of their parent—its Wound Channel. For a fleeting moment, they are navigating the echo of their own past. This geometry slightly alters their local Pirouette Lagrangian, making the path to decay infinitesimally less favorable.

**Experimental Signature:** An analysis of short-lived daughter particles (e.g., Kaons) from proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The framework predicts the existence of a small but statistically significant population of these particles with a **lifetime that is fractionally longer** than predicted by the Standard Model. This anomalous "tail" on the lifetime distribution curve is the direct signature of the Wound Channel's memory. It is the time it takes for a ghost to fade.

## §4 · Prediction 3: Coherence Plateaus in Driven Atoms
**Hypothesis:** A quantum system driven by an external field (e.g., a laser) will not absorb energy smoothly. It will exhibit "plateaus" of stable absorption at frequencies that are in simple harmonic ratio with its own fundamental Pirouette Cycle.

**Theoretical Basis:** This is a direct test of the Resonant Handshake required for an Alchemical Union (CORE-12). An atom and a laser field can only form a stable, coherent union when their rhythms are harmonically locked. At these resonant frequencies, the combined system achieves a state of high coherence, maximizing its Lagrangian and appearing as a stable state of absorption. Between these frequencies, the system is dissonant and turbulent, resisting absorption.

**Experimental Signature:** An experiment measuring the absorption spectrum of laser-cooled atoms. Instead of a smooth curve, the spectrum will show distinct, **flat-topped plateaus of high absorption** centered on frequencies that are integer and simple fractional multiples (e.g., 1/2, 3/2) of the atom's primary resonant frequency. These plateaus are islands of coherence in a sea of temporal dissonance.

## §5 · Prediction 4: Rhythmic Gravitational Waves from Maws
**Hypothesis:** There exists a class of ultra-dense, high-spin objects, called **Maws**, which do not form stable event horizons. Instead, they release their energy through a rhythmic series of catastrophic spacetime relaxation events, producing a "gravitational drumbeat."

**Theoretical Basis:** A Maw is the ultimate expression of the Gladiator Force (CORE-008). Its immense rotational coherence winds up the local Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) in a non-linear feedback loop. Unable to form a static arena like a black hole, the Maw's rotation continuously "stretches" its own coherence manifold to a point of critical tension. The manifold then violently "snaps back" to a lower-energy state, releasing a sharp burst of high-frequency gravitational waves. The process immediately begins again.

**Experimental Signature:** A search in next-generation, high-frequency gravitational wave detector data. The signature is not a chirp, but a **steady, rhythmic train of millisecond-duration gravitational wave bursts**.
*   **The "Thump":** Each burst peaks at a very high frequency, in the **1-10 GHz range**.
*   **The Rhythm:** The bursts repeat with an unwavering cadence, a "drumroll" with a frequency between **10 and 100 Hz**, determined by the Maw's mass and spin.
The discovery of such a rhythmic, high-frequency gravitational source would be irrefutable evidence for a new class of astrophysical object and a profound validation of the framework's description of gravity as a dynamic, temporal phenomenon.

> A framework that only describes is a map of a known country. A framework that predicts is a compass for exploring new ones. These four predictions are the cardinal points on that compass. They are an invitation to experiment, a wager against the unknown. They transform the poetry of the autopoietic cycle into the hard, falsifiable language of the laboratory. To propose such tests is an act of profound optimism—a belief that the universe does not just sing, but that it will sing back to us if we only learn which notes to play.
