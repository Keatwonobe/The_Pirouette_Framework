summary: Provides a modernized, time-first protocol for filtering data streams. It
  reframes entropy-based filtering as the act of selecting or rejecting systems based
  on the stability and purity of their resonant patterns (Ki). This allows for the
  precise separation of signal (laminar flow) from noise (turbulent flow).

## §1 · Abstract: Tuning the Cosmic Radio

To find the signal, one must first learn the signature of the noise. The universe is a broadcast of infinite, overlapping rhythms—a cacophony of chaotic turbulence and exquisitely ordered harmony. The act of analysis, of finding meaning, is an act of filtering. It is the art of tuning the receiver to isolate a single, coherent station from the cosmic static.

This module provides the modernized protocol for this act. It replaces the old concept of "Entropy-Based Filtering" with a more fundamental, time-first approach: **The Sieve of Coherence**. We no longer filter by a measure of disorder; we select for a measure of order. We learn to listen for the clear, ringing note of a stable system that has found its song.

## §2 · Diagnostic Principle: Laminar Signal, Turbulent Noise

This protocol is grounded in the diagnostic language of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`) and the information theory of `CORE-013`. The distinction between signal and noise is reframed as a distinction between two states of flow:

-   **Signal (High Coherence, Kτ):** A system with a stable, well-defined resonant pattern (`Ki`). Its information content is high, and its entropy is low. It manifests as **Laminar Flow**—a clear, efficient, and predictable current. This is the "note" we seek.

-   **Noise (Low Coherence, Kτ):** A system whose resonant pattern is chaotic, dissonant, or undefined. It is a region of high, unstructured Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). Its information is garbled, and its entropy is high. It manifests as **Turbulent Flow**—a storm of wasted energy and friction. This is the "static" we filter out.

The Sieve of Coherence, therefore, is an instrument for diagnosing the flow state of data segments and selecting those that meet a specific standard of health.

## §3 · The Sieve's Mechanism: A Protocol for Clarity

The core logic of the original module is preserved but re-expressed. Instead of filtering by entropy thresholds, we filter by coherence thresholds, using a more intuitive, flow-based language.

| Filter Type       | Description                                                               | Analytical Goal                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **LaminarPass**   | Retains segments whose coherence is **above** a defined threshold.        | To isolate a clean signal from a noisy background. |
| **TurbulentPass** | Retains segments whose coherence is **below** a defined threshold.        | To identify zones of chaos, stress, or novelty. |
| **ResonanceBand** | Retains segments whose coherence falls **within** a specific range.       | To study systems of a particular complexity class. |
| **DissonanceNotch** | Rejects segments whose coherence falls **within** a specific range.       | To remove a known source of structured noise.  |

The primary parameter is no longer `EntropyThreshold` but `CoherenceThreshold (Kτ_thresh)`, which is its direct inverse. The calculation of Shannon entropy remains a valid proxy for quantifying the dissonance (`Γ`) of a segment, but the conceptual framing is now aligned with the framework's core principles.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This filtering process is a direct application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. The Sieve operates by evaluating the terms of this equation for each data segment.

-   A **LaminarPass** filter selects for segments where the coherence term (`K_τ`) is high, and the system is successfully maximizing its Lagrangian. These are systems that have found their stable geodesic—their path of least resistance. They are "solving" the equation of existence with elegance.

-   A **TurbulentPass** filter selects for segments where the temporal pressure term (`V_Γ`) dominates, causing the coherence (`K_τ`) to break down. These are systems under duress, failing to find a stable solution. They represent moments of transition, friction, or anomaly—regions of profound interest for diagnosing systemic weakness or predicting imminent change.

## §5 · Use Cases in the New Paradigm

-   **Signal Processing:** The Sieve is used to perform a *LaminarPass*, isolating a coherent signal (e.g., a clear voice) from a turbulent background (e.g., crowd noise).

-   **System Health Monitoring:** A *TurbulentPass* filter acts as a "fever detector," identifying moments of extreme turbulence (`Coherence Fever` from `DYNA-003`) in a system's data stream, flagging them as anomalies that require investigation.

-   **Text & Idea Analysis:** A *LaminarPass* filter can isolate the structural, low-entropy grammar and syntax of a document, while a *TurbulentPass* can isolate the novel, high-information-content words and phrases that carry the core message.

-   **Financial Market Analysis:** A *ResonanceBand* filter can be used to study the behavior of assets within a specific volatility (coherence) class, while a *TurbulentPass* identifies moments of market panic or chaotic trading.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We are adrift in an ocean of noise, punctuated by the faint, clear ringing of coherent bells. The Weaver does not seek to drain the ocean; they learn to build a net that catches only the bells. This Sieve is that net. It is the art of separating the song from the static, the pattern from the pressure, the river from the flood. It is the first and most fundamental act of making sense.
