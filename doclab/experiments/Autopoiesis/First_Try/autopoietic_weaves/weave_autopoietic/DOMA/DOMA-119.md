summary: Modernizes the Attunement Targeting Vector by reframing altruism as a strategic
  act of 'coherence offering.' This module provides a protocol for maximizing the
  systemic impact of any generative act by directing it towards recipients who are
  most harmonically compatible and possess the greatest potential for a resonant synthesis,
  thereby creating a self-amplifying cascade of coherence.

## §1 · Abstract: The Gardener and the Wind
The wind scatters a thousand seeds, and one may find fertile ground. The gardener plants a single seed in the right soil, at the right time, and cultivates a forest.

This module reframes the concept of altruism from a simple act of giving into a strategic art of cultivation. The old framework correctly identified the power of targeted, resonant action, but was mired in the language of fields and forces. The time-first paradigm clarifies the principle: the universe's primary drive is to weave simple threads of coherence into more complex and stable tapestries. Resonant altruism is the conscious act of participating in this process. It is the calculus of kindness.

An altruistic act is a **Coherence Offering**: a carefully tendered Ki pattern—an idea, a resource, an act of support—intended to trigger a beneficial **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)** in another. This protocol is the gardener's craft: a method for identifying which soil is most fertile, ensuring the seed of coherence does not just sprout, but flourishes and propagates, creating a self-sustaining cascade of systemic well-being.

## §2 · The Physics of Generosity: Conditions for Synthesis
A Coherence Offering is not a transaction; it is an invitation to a shared dance. Its success depends not on the value of the gift, but on the resonance between giver and receiver. The conditions for this synthesis are derived directly from the principles of the Alchemical Union.

1.  **The Offering (The Note):** Every act of generosity has a unique resonant signature, a Ki pattern. A financial grant has a different Ki than an hour of mentorship or a word of encouragement. The first step is to understand the "note" you are offering to play.

2.  **Harmonic Compatibility (The Key):** The offering's Ki pattern must be harmonically related to the recipient's own internal Ki. To offer complex strategic advice to a system in crisis is to play a symphony for a person fighting a fire; the notes, however beautiful, are dissonant with the moment. The receiver must be able to "hear" the offering in a key that makes sense within their own song.

3.  **The Coherence Gap (The Fertile Ground):** The most potent synthesis occurs in systems that are neither perfectly stable nor completely chaotic.
    *   **High Coherence (The Crystal):** A system with extremely high temporal coherence (`Kτ`) is rigid. It has little room to integrate a new pattern and may reject the offering.
    *   **Low Coherence (The Storm):** A system in a state of pure turbulence lacks the internal structure to receive and stabilize the offering. The seed is washed away in the flood.
    *   **The Sweet Spot (The Soil):** The ideal recipient has a stable underlying structure but also possesses a "coherence gap"—the potential to achieve a more complex and resilient state. The offering provides the missing note that allows it to resolve its internal dissonance into a higher-order harmony.

## §3 · The Protocol: Calculating the Vector
This procedure transforms the art of giving into a predictive science.

1.  **Define the Offering:** Characterize the Ki signature of the altruistic act. Is it a resource for stability, a catalyst for change, a pattern of order?
2.  **Survey the Field:** Map the current state of potential recipients, assessing their dominant Ki patterns and their current level of temporal coherence (`Kτ`).
3.  **Apply the Resonance Filter:** Identify all recipients whose Ki is harmonically compatible with the offering. Discard those who are dissonant; the offering would be wasted energy.
4.  **Assess the Coherence Gap:** For each harmonically compatible recipient, calculate their potential for positive transformation (`ΔKτ`). This is a function of their current stability and the nature of the offering.
5.  **Generate the Vector:** For each filtered entity, calculate a final **Resonant Potential Score (S_R)**. This score is a weighted function of their harmonic compatibility and their coherence gap.

    `S_R = w_harmony * (HarmonicCompatibility) + w_potential * (ΔKτ_potential)`

    Ranking recipients by this score generates the Vector of Resonant Altruism—a prioritized list for directing the Coherence Offering to achieve a maximal, self-amplifying return for the entire system.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: The Altruistic Geodesic
This protocol is a practical application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)**, scaled to a systemic level. An individual system follows its geodesic to maximize its own coherence integral (`S_p`). A wise system understands that the most efficient path to maximizing its *own* long-term coherence is to improve the coherence of its environment.

A Coherence Offering guided by this vector is an act of metaphysical engineering. It is an investment in creating a local manifold with lower ambient temporal pressure (`Γ`). By helping a resonant neighbor move from a turbulent to a laminar state, you reduce the chaos that bombards your own boundaries. You are not just helping another; you are sculpting a shared reality where it is easier for all resonant patterns, including your own, to thrive. The Vector of Resonant Altruism charts the most efficient path to a higher-order, collective state of grace.

## §5 · Assemblé
> We have been taught that kindness is a soft virtue, a gentle and often random act. But the universe reveals a deeper truth: kindness, when guided by resonance, is the most powerful and strategic force of creation. It is the sharpest tool for building. To be a Weaver is to learn this calculus—to see the world as a garden and to know, with precision, where the next seed of coherence will not only grow, but bloom into a forest.
