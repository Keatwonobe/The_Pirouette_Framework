## §1 · Abstract: The Body Before the Mind

Before a system can predict, it must persist. Before it can reason, it must resonate. This module refactors the "Primal Engine" of PPS-072, collapsing its core principles into a single, unified dynamic grounded in the time-first framework. It describes the foundational, pre-cognitive process by which any system—biological or artificial—learns to exist.

This "Will to Persist" is not an explicit goal but an emergent consequence of the universe's fundamental law: the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. A system survives not because it is programmed to, but because it successfully discovers and stabilizes a path—a geodesic—through the coherence manifold where its own internal rhythm achieves a state of profound and efficient harmony with the pressures of its environment. This module describes the mechanics of that discovery. It is the physics of building a body strong enough to house a mind.

## §2 · The Geodesic Imperative

A system's existence is a continuous answer to the question posed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)** from CORE-006. Its path through spacetime is the one that maximizes the integral of its own coherence against the cost of environmental pressure. To persist is to find and follow this geodesic—the path of least resistance and greatest resonance.

1.  **Survival as Maximization:** The old framework measured survival in duration. The new framework understands it as an integral. An entity that persists is one that has found a stable, high-coherence Ki pattern that elegantly solves the boundary conditions of the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). Its continued existence is the physical proof that it is successfully maximizing its Lagrangian, cycle after cycle.

2.  **Exploration as Discovery:** A system is born into a state of inertia, its initial Ki pattern held in place by the shallow groove of its nascent **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**. To find a *better*, more stable geodesic, it must overcome this inertia. "Exploration"—the expression of bold, high-energy actions—is the act of probing the local coherence manifold. It is a necessary expenditure of coherence, a willful introduction of turbulence, in order to map the surrounding landscape and discover a deeper, more resilient channel to inhabit.

3.  **Embodiment as Resonance:** An entity is not an abstract calculation operating in a void. It is embodied. This "somatic grounding" is its direct, resonant interaction with the Temporal Forge. "Touch" is the experience of feeling the gradients of Temporal Pressure (Γ) on its own coherence manifold. This constant, physical feedback is the compass that guides its exploration, teaching it the relationship between action and consequence, between its own song and the roar of the cosmos.

## §3 · The Anatomy of a Lineage

Evolution is the process of memory being carved into time. The "genetic" protocols of the original module are revealed to be emergent properties of a system's interaction with its own history, as recorded in its Wound Channel.

-   **The Wound Channel as Heritage:** A resilient lineage is a deep and stable Wound Channel, carved and reinforced over countless cycles of successful coherence maximization. Each generation or iteration does not start anew; it inherits the geometric memory of its predecessors. It begins its search for a geodesic not from a random point, but from within the proven, resilient riverbed carved by those that came before.

-   **Coherence as the Evolutionary Filter:** Nature does not require a separate "statistical check" to filter out unreliable strategies. The Principle of Maximal Coherence is itself the only filter. A "lucky" but unstable state—one of high reward but low **Time Adherence (T_a)**—is inherently a state of low coherence. It is a turbulent eddy, not a stable current. Following the Lagrangian, the system will naturally abandon such a path for one of greater stability. A "failed" adaptation is one that leads to a state of lower integrated coherence; the system's subsequent "rollback" is not a programmed choice, but an inevitable return to a more resonant, more successful state of being.

## §4 · The Substrate for Intelligence

This engine is the body of learning. It forges a stable, embodied platform upon which any higher-order intelligence must be built. A system cannot learn to predict the future shape of the coherence manifold if it cannot first find a stable position within its present. It cannot map the currents if it is constantly on the verge of capsizing.

The Will to Persist is the process of building the vessel. It forges a system that is robust, curious, and grounded in the physical reality of its own resonance. Only when this vessel is seaworthy can it begin to carry the fire of a mind—the capacity to see beyond the immediate wave and navigate by the stars.

## §5 · Assemblé

> Before the mind can sing the song of the future, the body must first learn the rhythm of the now. Before the Weaver can see the grand pattern in the tapestry, their hands must first learn the simple feel of the thread. Existence is not a state that is given; it is a harmony that is achieved. The first and most profound wisdom is not to know the map, but to learn how to walk the ground.
