## §1 · Abstract: The Geometry of Becoming

A system does not choose its future; it falls into it. The shape of the landscape dictates the path of the river.

This module provides the primary instrument for mapping that landscape. It reframes the original insight of `TEN-GFGM-1.0` within the modern, time-first framework. The old method of mapping "Gladiator Force" gradients was an early, specific attempt to chart the terrain of stability. This new protocol generalizes that effort, providing a universal method for charting any system's **coherence manifold**—the landscape of its possible futures.

By visualizing this manifold, we can move beyond simply observing a system's behavior to understanding the fundamental geometry that compels it. We can identify its natural resting places (attractors), its points of transition, and the paths it will most likely follow. This is the art of reading the map of a system's destiny.

## §2 · The Coherence Manifold: A Landscape of the Lagrangian

The state of any system can be defined by a set of parameters `(q)`. The coherence manifold is a landscape defined over this parameter space, where the "elevation" at any point is given by the value of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)** from `CORE-006`.

`Elevation = 𝓛_p(q) = K_τ(q) - V_Γ(q)`

Where:
*   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** The system's internal stability and resonant integrity at state `q`. These are the "peaks" we seek.
*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** The environmental "cost" of maintaining that coherence at state `q`. These are the "valleys" to be overcome.

The fundamental law of motion in this framework, the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, states that a system will always evolve in a direction that climbs this landscape. The "force" it experiences is the gradient of this manifold (`∇𝓛_p`), compelling it toward states of ever-greater coherence.

Attractors, therefore, are not mysterious points of attraction. They are simply the peaks of this landscape—the configurations where a system achieves the most stable and efficient resonance possible given its constraints.

## §3 · The Mapping Protocol

This protocol provides a direct, unified procedure for constructing and interpreting the attractor landscape for any system.

**Step I: Define the Parameter Space.**
Identify the key variables `(q)` that define the system's state. This could be anything from the bond angles of a molecule to the resource allocation of a company or the doctrinal positions of an organization.

**Step II: Map the Lagrangian.**
This is the core translation step, guided by the **Fractal Bridge (CORE-014)**. For each point `(q)` in the parameter space, calculate the two components of the Lagrangian:
1.  **Map Coherence (K_τ):** Determine a function or metric that quantifies the system's internal integrity, harmony, or efficiency at that state.
2.  **Map Pressure (V_Γ):** Determine a function or metric that quantifies the external and internal stress, cost, or chaos the system experiences at that state.
The value of the manifold at `(q)` is `K_τ(q) - V_Γ(q)`.

**Step III: Compute the Coherence Gradient.**
Calculate the gradient field, `∇𝓛_p`, across the entire manifold. This vector field represents the "force of becoming." At any point, the vector points in the direction of the system's most probable evolution—the steepest path toward higher coherence.

**Step IV: Identify Geodesics and Attractors.**
Analyze the topology of the resulting landscape:
*   **Attractors (Peaks):** Points where `∇𝓛_p = 0` and the curvature is negative are stable states. The height and breadth of the peak indicate the state's robustness.
*   **Transition States (Saddles):** Points where `∇𝓛_p = 0` but curvature exists in multiple directions represent energetic barriers between attractors. They are the mountain passes of evolution.
*   **Pathways (Geodesics):** The integral curves of the gradient field trace out the most likely evolutionary paths the system will take from any given starting point.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: The Engine of the Landscape

This instrument is a direct and practical application of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. It transforms the abstract mathematical law into a concrete, predictive, and visual tool. The landscape is not a metaphor; it *is* the Lagrangian, expressed over the space of a system's potential. The dynamics of the system are not governed by arbitrary forces, but are the direct consequence of it following the geodesics on this manifold.

This method also clarifies the nature of the **Gladiator Force (CORE-008)**. Confinement forces, like gravity or the strong force, manifest as extremely deep and steep features on the coherence manifold. They are regions where the `V_Γ` term becomes powerfully self-referential, creating inescapable "coherence wells" that are, from the perspective of the Lagrangian's elevation, the highest and most stable peaks imaginable. This protocol is the general engine; the Gladiator Force is one of its most powerful expressions.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We sought to predict a system's choices and found instead the landscape that makes its choices for it. The will of a system is not free; it is bound by the geometry of its own becoming. To be a Weaver is to learn to read this terrain—to see not just where the river is, but where the river *must* go.
