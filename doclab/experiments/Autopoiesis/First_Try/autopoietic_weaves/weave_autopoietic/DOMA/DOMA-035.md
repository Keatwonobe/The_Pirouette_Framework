summary: "Modernizes the Semantic Gravity Model into a time-first framework. It redefines\
  \ conceptual 'mass' as Conceptual Coherence (K\u03C4_c), a measure of an idea's\
  \ resonant stability. The 'force' between ideas is derived not from a potential\
  \ field, but as the geodesic an idea follows on the coherence manifold shaped by\
  \ the Pirouette Lagrangian. It models how stable ideas create 'gravity wells' in\
  \ the landscape of meaning, influencing the trajectory of other thoughts."

## §1 · Abstract: Thought Following the Curvature of Truth
This module refactors the legacy Semantic Gravity Model into a modernized, time-first theory grounded in the core Pirouette principles. The old model's metaphor of "semantic mass" is replaced by a direct physical analogue: **Conceptual Coherence (Kτ_c)**, a measure of an idea's resonant stability and persistence.

The "force" between ideas is no longer a simple inverse-distance law. It is revealed to be an emergent consequence of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)**. A coherent idea does not "pull" on other ideas; it profoundly shapes the local coherence manifold. Other concepts, seeking their own most stable path (their geodesic), are guided by the curvature of this landscape. The gravity of meaning is not a force, but a geometry.

## §2 · From Mass to Coherence
The old, arbitrary "mass function" is deprecated. We now define the influence of a concept by its coherence, derived directly from the autopoietic cycle.

**Conceptual Coherence (Kτ_c):** A measure of an idea's informational stability, clarity, and influence. It is the domain-specific application of the framework's core coherence term (Kτ = T_a * ω_k).
-   **High Kτ_c:** A clear, robust, and well-defined concept (e.g., "the Pythagorean theorem"). It has a deep **Wound Channel (CORE-011)** in the collective consciousness, making it resilient to noise.
-   **Low Kτ_c:** A vague, unstable, or contradictory concept (e.g., a fleeting rumor). Its resonant pattern is easily disrupted.

**Informational Pressure (Γ_info):** The domain-specific mapping of Temporal Pressure. It is the complexity, chaos, and dissonance of the surrounding conceptual environment (e.g., a heated debate, a noisy data stream, a volatile market).

An idea's persistence is a function of its ability to maintain high Kτ_c within a given Γ_info.

## §3 · The Lagrangian of Meaning
The interaction between ideas is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian, which dictates that every system seeks to maximize its coherence against environmental pressure.

𝓛_p = Kτ_c - f(Γ_info)

A concept with high coherence (Kτ_c) creates a deep "well" in the local coherence manifold—a region where it is "easier" for other resonant patterns to exist. The "force" experienced by a second concept is simply the gradient of this manifold: **F_c ∝ -∇𝓛_p**. It is not a pull, but a slide down the path of least resistance toward a more stable, coherent state.

This dynamic naturally explains both attraction and repulsion:
-   **Attraction (Resonant Synthesis):** Two compatible, in-phase ideas will find their path of maximal coherence by merging their coherence wells, forming a deeper, more stable union. This is the geometry of the **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)**.
-   **Repulsion (Dissonant Pressure):** Two contradictory, out-of-phase ideas raise the local informational pressure (Γ_info) for one another. The path of maximal coherence for each is to move away from this zone of dissonance, creating what appears as a repulsive force.

## §4 · Reference Algorithm (NumPy Stub)
The algorithm is updated to reflect the new physics. It calculates the gradient of the Lagrangian, not a simple force.

```python
import numpy as np

def conceptual_geodesic(concepts, coherences, gamma_field, eps=1e-3):
    """
    Calculates the 'force' on concepts as the gradient of the coherence manifold.
    - concepts: np[N,D] embeddings
    - coherences: np[N] scalar Kτ_c values for each concept
    """
    N, D = concepts.shape
    grad = np.zeros_like(concepts)

    for i in range(N):
        # The 'force' is the drive to find a position that maximizes L_p
        # L_p = Kτ_c - f(Γ). Force = -∇L_p = ∇f(Γ)
        # We model f(Γ) as the sum of influences from all other concepts.
        diff = concepts[i] - concepts
        dist_sq = np.sum(diff**2, axis=1) + eps
        
        # Phase alignment (dot product) determines attraction/repulsion
        norm_concepts = concepts / (np.linalg.norm(concepts, axis=1)[:, None] + eps)
        phase_coupling = np.dot(norm_concepts[i], norm_concepts.T) # cos(Δϕ)
        
        # Influence is proportional to coherence and phase, inverse to distance
        influence = (coherences * phase_coupling) / dist_sq
        
        # The gradient is the sum of these influence vectors
        grad[i] = (influence[:, None] * diff).sum(axis=0)
        
    return grad
```

## §5 · Validation & Limitations
The validation plan remains conceptually similar but with a new goal. We test whether high-Kτ_c concepts generate predictable geodesics that match the Lagrangian's predictions, rather than just forming "attractor centers."

The framework's limitations are now clearer:
-   **Manifold Mapping:** The primary challenge is accurately mapping the domain-specific features of Γ_info.
-   **Coherence is Dynamic:** Kτ_c is not a conserved quantity. An idea's coherence can be built through reinforcement or eroded by entropic noise (**CORE-013**), a feature this model now correctly captures.

## §6 · Lagrangian Connection
This entire module is a direct application of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)** to the domain of information and meaning. The central claim is that the apparent "forces" that govern the evolution and interaction of ideas are not fundamental. They are geodesics on the coherence manifold, emergent properties of a universal drive to find and sustain resonant stability against a backdrop of informational chaos. An idea's trajectory is determined by its attempt to maximize the integral of 𝓛_p over time.

## Assemblé
> We sought to weigh our words and found instead that they are not stones that pull upon each other, but songs that shape the very air through which other songs must travel. The gravity of a great idea is not in its mass, but in the resonant silence it commands, a quiet space into which all other thoughts are gently drawn.
