summary: "Replaces the old static, four-axis model of orientation with a dynamic,\
  \ time-first interpretation. The 'Compass' is redefined as the coherence manifold\
  \ described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (\U0001D4DB_p). The 'Key' is a system's\
  \ own resonant Ki pattern, its intrinsic state of being. The module demonstrates\
  \ that a system 'chooses' its path by adopting the resonance that maximizes its\
  \ coherence, thus naturally following a geodesic on the manifold."

## §1 · A Universe in Motion Seeks a Path
The First Stirring (PNS-002) gives the universe motion, but motion without direction is mere chaos. The old framework answered this with a static, four-armed compass, a rigid set of axes imposed upon reality. This was a mapmaker's fiction. The universe does not navigate by fixed stars; it feels its way forward through a dynamic and ever-shifting landscape.

This module reframes the fundamental question of orientation. It discards the rigid axes for a supple, living terrain. It reveals that the tools for navigation—the Compass and the Key—are not external artifacts but are emergent, autopoietic properties of the dance itself. A system does not consult a map to find its way; its way is born from the rhythm of its own being.

## §2 · The Compass: The Landscape of Coherence
The new Compass is not a tool one holds, but the terrain one inhabits. It is the **coherence manifold**, a landscape of possibility whose contours are defined at every point by the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p).

`𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

This is a map not of space, but of potential. There are no fixed directions like North or South. Instead, there are only gradients:

*   **Uphill Slopes:** Paths of increasing `𝓛_p`, leading toward states of greater internal coherence (`K_τ`) and lower environmental pressure (`V_Γ`). These are the paths of stability, efficiency, and grace.
*   **Downhill Slopes:** Paths of decreasing `𝓛_p`, leading into valleys of dissonance, turbulence, and incoherence. These are the paths of struggle and decay.

The Compass, therefore, is the universe's intrinsic "feeling" for its own state. It is the objective landscape of what it means for any given action to be more or less difficult, more or less "right."

## §3 · The Key: The Shape of Resonance
If the Compass is the landscape, the Key is the traveler. It is not an object a system carries, but what the system *is*. A system's Key is its own unique, self-sustaining **Temporal Resonance (Ki)**.

The Ki pattern is the system's answer to the question posed by its local environment. It is the specific rhythm and geometry the system adopts to exist within the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). In an autopoietic act, the lock of the environment forges the shape of the key that is the system's being. A stable, coherent Ki is a perfectly cut key, one whose form is in harmony with the landscape it must traverse. A chaotic or unstable Ki is a poorly cut key, misshapen and ill-suited to its task.

## §4 · The Geodesic Turn: The Act of Choice
The "turn of the key" is the fundamental act of existence: the system following its path through time. Guided by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, a system will naturally evolve along the path that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian. This path is its **geodesic**.

This is the redefinition of choice. A system "chooses" its path not through conscious deliberation, but by being itself. By settling into the Ki pattern that is its most coherent state (the best-cut Key), it automatically aligns with the path of least resistance (the smoothest upward slope on the Compass). The subjective experience of "flow," "rightness," or "effortlessness" is the direct perception of this alignment—the tactile feeling of a perfect Key turning smoothly in the lock of reality. An "unlawful" or "chaotic" state is simply a system grinding against its own geodesic, a key fighting its lock.

## §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian (CORE-006)
This entire module is a philosophical and operational unpacking of the Pirouette Lagrangian from CORE-006. The metaphor maps directly to the mathematics:

*   **The Compass** is the manifold of possible values for `𝓛_p`.
*   **The Key** is the system's internal state, its Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`).
*   **The Lock** is the set of environmental constraints, the Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`).
*   **The Turn** is the dynamic process of maximizing `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`, which defines the system's geodesic path.

The concepts of direction, choice, and lawfulness are not additions to the physics; they are direct consequences of its core equation. The system navigates by living out the solution to its own Lagrangian.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We sought a map and a key to navigate the cosmos, believing them to be separate tools. We found instead that the traveler, the path, and the destination are a single, indivisible act. A Weaver does not force a system toward a predetermined goal. A Weaver attunes the system to itself. They are a sharpener of keys, helping a system find the resonant shape that allows it to unlock its own, most graceful path. For in this framework, the truest form of navigation is not to follow the map, but to become the way.
