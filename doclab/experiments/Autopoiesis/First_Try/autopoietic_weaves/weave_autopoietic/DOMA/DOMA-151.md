## §1 · Abstract: Learning the Universe's Dialects

To listen to the universe is to hear a symphony of infinite complexity. The previous framework provided a tuning fork set to two specific notes, `Ki-rest` and `Ki-motion`, hoping to hear them in the chaos. This was an essential first step, but it mistook two common notes for the entire scale.

This modernized instrument, Temporal Resonance Analysis, provides the sheet music. It is a universal protocol for taking any complex signal—the audible trace of reality's song—and decomposing it into its fundamental components. It allows a Weaver to distinguish the clear, coherent melodies of stable systems (their Ki) from the ambient, chaotic harmony of the environment (its Γ). It is the primary tool for translating a raw signal into a deep understanding of a system's health, state, and purpose.

## §2 · From Fixed Constants to Dynamic States

The core insight of the old `Ki-Harmonic Decomposition` module is preserved but profoundly re-contextualized. The two `Ki` constants are not fundamental laws of nature; they are archetypal *solutions* to the universal drive for coherence.

-   **The Stable Archetype (`Ki-rest`):** This is the signature of a system in a state of high internal coherence and low interaction. It has found a maximally efficient, self-contained resonant pattern (Ki) to solve for a gentle, predictable Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is a system in equilibrium, a perfectly held note.

-   **The Propagating Archetype (`Ki-motion`):** This is the signature of a system in active dialogue with its environment. It is a system propagating, adapting, or responding to a more complex and dynamic Γ. Its resonant pattern is "stressed" by this interaction, resulting in a slightly different but equally valid harmonic solution. It is a note sung while moving.

This new framework recognizes that these are just two of a near-infinite number of possible resonant states. This instrument is designed to identify *any* such state, not just these two.

## §3 · The Modern Protocol: Decomposing the Temporal Signature

This protocol transforms a one-dimensional signal—a slice of the local Temporal Signature `T(x)` from CORE-003—into a rich, multi-dimensional understanding of the system's dynamics.

1.  **Spectral Transformation:** The input signal is processed using a time-frequency analysis method, such as a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). This is not just a mathematical step; it is an act of perception. It transforms a flat line of data into a vibrant landscape, a spectrogram revealing which rhythms exist, at what intensity, and for how long. This landscape is the visual representation of the Temporal Forge in action.

2.  **Coherence Identification:** The Weaver now reads the landscape. The bright, persistent "ridges" of high energy in the spectrogram are the coherent Ki patterns of the underlying systems. They are the clear melodies. The low-energy, broadband "floor" of the spectrogram is the signature of the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the noise of the cosmic foundry.

3.  **Resonant Classification:** For each identified Ki pattern (each ridge), we can now extract a rich set of diagnostic metrics that describe the state of the system that created it:
    -   **Frequency (ω_k):** The fundamental rhythm of the system's being.
    -   **Bandwidth (Δω):** The "purity" of the resonance. A narrow, sharp peak signifies a highly stable, coherent system (a Stable Archetype). A broad, diffuse peak signifies a noisy, adaptive, or stressed system (a Propagating Archetype).
    -   **Persistence (Δt):** The duration over which the resonance maintains its integrity. This is a direct measure of its stability and Time Adherence (T_a).

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This analytical process is the critical bridge between observation and prediction, as it allows for the direct measurement of the terms in the core equation of the framework, the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = T_a * ω_k - f(Γ)`).

-   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** By measuring a resonance's fundamental frequency (`ω_k`) and its persistence (`T_a`), we can quantify the system's internal Temporal Coherence. This is the "kinetic" term of the Lagrangian, representing the quality and intensity of the system's own song.

-   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** By measuring the energy and complexity of the spectrogram's noise floor, we can quantify the ambient `f(Γ)`. This is the "potential" term, representing the environmental cost of maintaining coherence.

With this instrument, a Weaver can take any signal from any system and calculate its Lagrangian. This transforms the framework from a descriptive philosophy into a predictive engine, allowing one to model a system's past and chart the geodesics of its most likely future.

## §5 · The Assemblé

> We were once told to listen for two specific notes in a symphony. We built instruments tuned only to their pitch, celebrating each time we heard a faint echo. Now, we understand. The goal was never to find the two notes; it was to learn how to hear the entire song. This instrument does not listen for an answer. It teaches us the language of the music itself, allowing the Weaver to distinguish melody from noise, artist from instrument, and a system's chosen path from the pressures that shape it.
