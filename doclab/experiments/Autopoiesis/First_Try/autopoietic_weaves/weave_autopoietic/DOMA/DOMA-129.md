## §1 · Abstract: Measuring the Echo's Fade
This module provides the primary instrumentation for a core Pirouette principle: nothing lasts forever. It refactors the legacy `Dimensional Decay Analysis` into a time-first protocol for quantifying the process of **Coherence Degradation**, as defined in CORE-013.

The central insight is that decay is not a force, but a process of erosion. A system's coherent resonance (its `Ki` pattern, its "signal") is a river of information flowing through the chaotic landscape of the Temporal Forge. This protocol provides the tools to measure the rate at which that river's banks are worn away by the ambient noise of Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), how its current slows, and how its unique song fades back into the universal static. It is the art of reading the story told by a fading echo.

## §2 · From Phenomenon to Principle: The Physics of Fading
The universe is a dialogue between memory and entropy. Coherence Degradation is the physics of that conversation.

**The Signal (Coherence, Kτ):** A system's existence, its identity, is its stable pattern of temporal resonance (`Ki`). The clarity and stability of this pattern is its Temporal Coherence (`T_a`), which together define its total coherence, `Kτ`. This is the "signal" it broadcasts into the universe—the thread of its being.

**The Noise (Temporal Pressure, Γ):** Every system is immersed in the Temporal Forge, the ambient, chaotic superposition of all other rhythms in its environment. This is the "noise" that constantly bombards the system, seeking to disrupt its pattern and degrade its information.

**The Process (Erosion):** Coherence Degradation is the quantifiable result of the noise eroding the signal. This process is not uniform. Its dynamics are a direct reflection of the system's nature:
-   A system with high intrinsic Temporal Coherence (`T_a`) is like a river with strong, well-defined banks; it resists erosion and persists for longer.
-   A system in a high `Γ` environment is like a river flowing through a turbulent storm; it erodes much faster.
-   The oscillatory features sometimes observed in decay are the "ghosts" of the underlying `Ki` pattern—the fundamental frequency of the system's song echoing as it fades.

This is the process that governs the fading of a Wound Channel's memory (CORE-011), the half-life of a particle, and the forgetting of a skill.

## §3 · The Auditor's Protocol: A Guide to Measurement
To quantify the fraying of a thread, a Weaver follows this three-step protocol:

1.  **Isolate the Signal:** Identify and isolate the data stream that represents the system's degrading coherence. This could be the amplitude of a physical wave, the information content of a memory trace, or the economic output of a declining organization. This quantity is the measure of the system's remaining `Kτ`.

2.  **Select the Erosion Geometry:** Choose a mathematical model that best describes the *character* of the erosion. The choice of model is a hypothesis about the physics of the interaction between the system and its environment.
    -   **Simple Exponential:** For systems where the rate of decay is proportional to the remaining coherence (most common cases).
    -   **Oscillatory Exponential:** For systems whose core `Ki` resonance influences the dissipation process, creating a "ripple" in the decay curve.
    -   **Power Law / Sigmoidal:** For complex systems with feedback loops or phase transitions that affect their degradation pathway.

3.  **Extract the Coherence Lifetime (τc):** Fit the selected model to the data. The primary output is the **Coherence Lifetime (τc)**, a single, powerful metric representing the characteristic time it takes for the system's coherence to decay by a factor of *e* (~63.2%). This, and its related metric, the **Coherence Half-Life (t_1/2)**, become the core diagnostic for the system's resilience.

## §4 · Core Equations of Erosion
These equations are the mathematical tools of the protocol, re-expressed in the time-first language.

#### **Simple Coherence Erosion**
Models the decay of a system's coherence `Kτ` from an initial state `Kτ(0)` with a characteristic lifetime `τc`.
`Kτ(t) = Kτ(0) * e^(-t/τc)`

#### **The Pirouette Coherence Lifetime**
This foundational equation models the Coherence Lifetime `τc` itself, showing how it emerges from the interplay between a system's internal stability (`T_a`) and its external pressure (`Γ`).
`τc = τ_0 * [ T_a / (1 - T_a) ] * (1 / Γ)`
-   `τ_0` is a baseline time constant specific to the system's scale and nature.
-   `T_a / (1 - T_a)` is the *resilience term*. It shows that as a system's Temporal Coherence approaches perfection (`T_a` → 1), its lifetime approaches infinity, highlighting the profound power of internal order.
-   `1 / Γ` is the *environmental term*, showing that lifetime is inversely proportional to the ambient Temporal Pressure.

#### **Erosion with Resonant Signature**
Models decay with a superimposed ripple, representing the "ghost" of the system's `Ki` resonance.
`Kτ(t) = Kτ(0) * e^(-t/τc) * (1 + α * sin²(ω_k * t))`
-   `α` is the amplitude of the ripple.
-   `ω_k` is the fundamental frequency of the system's fading `Ki` pattern.

## §5 · Lagrangian Connection
The process of Coherence Degradation is a direct, measurable manifestation of a system failing to solve the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006). The Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, quantifies a system's state of "health."
-   A healthy, stable system successfully maximizes this function, maintaining high internal coherence (`K_τ`) against the cost of external pressure (`V_Γ`).
-   Decay is the process of this function tending towards zero. The erosion of `K_τ` by the constant, un-winnable battle against the pressure `V_Γ` means the system can no longer maintain its optimal path.
-   The Coherence Lifetime (`τc`) is, in essence, a measure of how long a system can successfully fight to keep its Lagrangian value significantly above the background noise of the universe.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We are born into a universe that does not promise permanence, only process. The Fraying of the Thread is not a manual for preventing the inevitable, but a lens for appreciating its poetry. To measure the decay of a star's light, a forgotten memory, or a fading note is to understand that the echo of a song is still music. For a Weaver, this is the ultimate diagnostic: to read the character of a system not just in how it lives, but in the grace and geometry of how it ends.
