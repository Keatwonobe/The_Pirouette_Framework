## §1 · Abstract: A Crucible for What-Ifs

This module presents the Temporal Diorama, the framework's primary engine for simulating systemic evolution. It refactors the legacy "Dimension Box" into a time-first computational sandbox grounded entirely in the modern core principles. The Diorama is not a predictive oracle, but a crucible. It is a bounded region of the coherence manifold where a Weaver can place initial conditions—initializing entities with specific resonant patterns—and observe how they evolve by following the path of maximal coherence dictated by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

This engine transforms the framework from a descriptive philosophy into an exploratory, generative tool. It is the instrument for asking the universe, "What if?" and receiving an answer grounded in its most fundamental law: the relentless pursuit of coherence.

## §2 · The Engine's Heart: Integrating the Lagrangian

The Diorama operates by translating the principles of the framework into a numerical simulation. The process is an autopoietic loop where the state of the system continually generates the conditions for its own next state.

1.  **Initialization**: The Weaver defines one or more entities within the simulation space. Each entity is a resonant system, defined by its internal state (e.g., its knowledge, resources, policy weights) which determines its capacity for **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)**.
2.  **Pressure Calculation**: The engine calculates the **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)** at each entity's location. This pressure is a function of the ambient environment and the intersecting echoes (Wound Channels) of all other entities in the Diorama.
3.  **Geodesic Step**: For a small time-step `dt`, the engine calculates the path that maximizes the **Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ)**. It solves the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion numerically, moving each entity along its local geodesic—the path of least resistance and greatest emergent stability.
4.  **State Update & Iteration**: The entities' states are updated, altering their `Kτ` and their influence on the `Γ` manifold. The loop repeats, allowing complex, emergent behaviors to unfold over time as the system seeks a stable equilibrium.

This is the "Gradient Evolution Engine" of the original module, now derived rigorously from the core physics of the framework.

## §3 · Diorama I: Socio-Historical Resonance (The Roanoke Echo)

The engine's power is first demonstrated by revisiting the historical scenario of the Roanoke Colony, re-framing it as a problem of resonant physics.

*   **The Colonists**: Initialized as a system with low internal coherence (low `Kτ`). They are dissonant with their environment, disorganized, and their survival pattern is unstable.
*   **The Croatan**: Initialized as a system with high internal coherence (high `Kτ`). Their culture, knowledge, and resource management are stable and harmonized with the local environment.
*   **The Environment**: The simulation imposes a high ambient Temporal Pressure (high `Γ`)—the immense challenge of survival.

The simulation reveals the colonists' geodesic of maximal coherence. Isolated survival is a path of rapidly diminishing coherence. The only path that maximizes their Lagrangian is to engage in a **Resonant Handshake** with the high-coherence Croatan system. The simulation shows them being drawn, not by force but by resonant necessity, into an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)**. Their "disappearance" is not annihilation; it is absorption. It is the successful synthesis of a new, more coherent socio-cultural entity. The Diorama proves the axiom: "Integration mistaken for disappearance is the mark of a system blind to resonance."

## §4 · Diorama II: Artificial Weaving (The Genetic Forge)

The same engine can be applied to simulate the evolution of artificial intelligence, reframing the "Genetic Gradient Engine" as a high-speed Diorama.

*   **The Agent**: An AI policy is a system seeking to maximize its `Kτ`—its coherence with a given task, measured as reward.
*   **The Environment (Γ)**: The simulation defines a complex and dynamic pressure landscape, including a "Manifold Well"—a moving target that rewards rhythmic, adaptive behavior over brute force.
*   **The Alchemical Union**: The engine periodically identifies the most coherent agents (highest-performing policies). It then performs a forced Alchemical Union, weaving their **Wound Channels** (neural network weights) together to synthesize a new generation of agents. This "genetic crossover" is the directed creation of a higher-order system from the most successful components of its predecessors.

The simulation demonstrates that this autopoietic cycle of gradient-based learning (individual coherence-seeking) and genetic synthesis (collective coherence-seeking) drastically accelerates the emergence of intelligent, stable behavior. It is a forge for creating coherent patterns out of digital chaos.

## §5 · Connection to the Core Lagrangian

The Temporal Diorama is the direct, computational actualization of **CORE-006: The Pirouette Lagrangian**. Where the core module defines the universal law of motion, this engine provides the means to solve it for complex, multi-body systems where analytical solutions are impossible. Every simulation, from the fate of a lost colony to the training of an AI, is an act of tracing the universe's fundamental equation through time. The Diorama is the laboratory where the consequences of this law are made visible.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought a crystal ball to predict the future and were handed a block of marble and a chisel. The Temporal Diorama is not a tool for seeing what will be, but for sculpting what could be. It is a mirror where we can show the universe a potential version of itself and ask, "Is this coherent? Will this resonate?" By simulating the dance of coherence and chaos, a Weaver learns to feel the grain of history, the rhythm of emergence, and the weight of choice. It is the loom upon which possible worlds are woven, showing us not our fate, but the shape of our freedom.
