## §1 · From Law to Landscape

The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) provides the fundamental law of motion for the universe: a system evolves to maximize its coherence. It gives us the engine: `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. This is the universal imperative.

However, a law requires a landscape upon which to act. The previous module, `PPS-062`, correctly identified the critical next step: to derive the specific functional form of the potential term—the architecture of the landscape—from first principles. A prose description of a "potential well" is insufficient; we must show that its shape is an inevitable consequence of symmetry, not an ad-hoc invention.

This module completes that derivation in the modern, time-first framework. It demonstrates how the Temporal Pressure term, `V_Γ`, emerges as a direct geometric consequence of a system's interaction with its environment and its own intrinsic, triaxial nature.

## §2 · The Invariant Motifs of Existence

For a system to persist, its Lagrangian must respect the fundamental symmetries of its existence. Any valid form for `V_Γ` must be constructed from invariant "motifs"—mathematical building blocks that are stable under the transformations of time and resonance. The old framework identified these correctly; we now re-express them in their proper context.

-   **The Pressure Niche (Cost of Environment):** A system's resonant pattern (Ki) is optimized for a specific ambient Temporal Density (`Γ_0`). Being in an environment that is too dense or too sparse imposes a "coherence cost," making it harder to maintain a stable rhythm. The simplest invariant motif describing this is a parabolic well:
    `V_Γ ∝ (Γ - Γ_0)²`
    This term represents the cost of being out of one's native environment.

-   **The Resonant Lock (Cost of Dissonance):** A system's Ki is cyclical. Its interaction with other systems is governed by the relative phase of their cycles. Coherent interaction (constructive interference) lowers the cost of existence, while dissonant interaction (destructive interference) raises it. This phase-locking behavior is captured by a periodic motif. For a system with an intrinsic n-fold symmetry, this is:
    `V_φ ∝ (1 - cos(nφ))`
    This term represents the cost of being out of sync.

The critical insight of the new framework is that the drive for high Time Adherence (`T_a`) is not part of this potential "cost" function `V_Γ`. It is the core of the "kinetic" reward function, `K_τ`. A system does not fall into a `T_a` well; it actively strives to climb the peak of its own `K_τ` by maximizing its `T_a`. The landscape of `V_Γ` is the terrain it must pay a toll to traverse while on this climb.

## §3 · The Nomad's Grammar as Architectural Blueprint

The most profound constraint on the landscape's shape comes from `CORE-002: The Nomad's Grammar`. Any stable entity must be described by its posture along the three fundamental axes of behavior: Vector, Cohesion, and Communion. These axes are not independent; they form a coupled system whose geometry dictates the stable "corners" of existence.

The `n=3` symmetry hinted at in the old module is now revealed to have a clear physical origin: it is the triaxial nature of being. The phase-locking potential `V_φ` is not just about a single phase angle, but about the relative phases between the system's expression on these three axes. This creates a "triple-well" potential, not in abstract space, but in the behavioral space of the Nomad's Grammar.

This potential term drives systems away from states of internal contradiction (e.g., trying to be maximally `Transactional` and maximally `Isolated` simultaneously) and towards archetypal, coherent states of being—the stable "soft-lock minima" that represent effective survival strategies.

## §4 · Assembling the Manifold: The Full Form of `V_Γ`

By combining these invariant motifs under the architectural constraints of the Nomad's Grammar, we arrive at the minimal, symmetry-derived form for the Temporal Pressure manifold. The total Lagrangian for a triaxial system is:

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

where the terms are now fully specified:

**Temporal Coherence (The Reward):**
`K_τ = ||T_a|| * ω_k`
Here, `||T_a||` is the magnitude of the system's state vector in the Nomad's Grammar space, representing its total coherence.

**Temporal Pressure (The Cost):**
`V_Γ = λ_Γ(Γ - Γ_0)² + λ_φ Σ_{i<j} [1 - cos(φ_ij)] + V_mixed(...)`
-   The first term is the environmental cost.
-   The second term is the cost of internal dissonance, where `φ_ij` is the relative phase between behavioral axes `i` and `j`. This term creates the stable corners in the behavioral landscape.
-   `V_mixed` represents the minimal coupling terms between the axes and the environment, as identified in `PPS-062`.

This derived form is not an assumption; it is the simplest possible mathematical expression that satisfies the known boundary conditions and symmetries of the framework. Each `λ` coefficient is not a fudge factor, but a measurable physical constant representing a specific "stiffness" or "coupling strength" within the manifold, ready for experimental determination.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We did not seek a formula for a force; we sought the blueprint for a cathedral. The architecture of the coherence manifold is the universe's sacred geometry. It reveals that reality is not a flat and featureless plain where anything is possible. It is a landscape with valleys of stability, peaks of expression, and channels of becoming, all shaped by the inescapable logic of symmetry. A Weaver's first and most crucial task is to learn to read this terrain—not to fight its grain, but to build with it. For in its architecture lies the secret to all that is stable, beautiful, and alive.
