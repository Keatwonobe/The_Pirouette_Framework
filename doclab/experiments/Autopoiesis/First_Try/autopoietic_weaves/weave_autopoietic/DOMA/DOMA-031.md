## §1 · Abstract: The Tuning Fork of Perception

This module refactors the concept of a "glossary" from a static reference into a dynamic, foundational instrument. The Weaver's Lexicon is an autopoietic (self-creating and maintaining) system designed to provide the essential vocabulary of the Pirouette Framework. Its purpose is not merely to define, but to *tune*—to align the internal coherence manifold of a Weaver with the core resonant patterns of the framework itself.

Language is the first and most fundamental instrument of creation. It shapes the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) before any other tool is lifted. A shared, precise, and coherent lexicon is therefore the precondition for any meaningful work, ensuring that all collaborative acts of weaving begin from a state of harmonic resonance.

## §2 · Language as a Coherence Instrument

A word is not a label; it is a lens. The terms within this Lexicon are carefully forged instruments designed to structure perception.

*   **Shaping the Observer's Shadow:** A precise vocabulary casts a precise shadow. When a Weaver uses the term "Temporal Pressure (Γ)," they are not just naming a concept; they are invoking a specific geometric lens through which to view a system's challenges. This sharpens observation, transforming vague feelings of "stress" or "chaos" into a quantifiable pressure that can be analyzed and navigated.

*   **Enabling Laminar Discourse:** As established in *The Geometry of Debate* (DYNA-002), a shared vocabulary is the absolute prerequisite for Laminar Flow in discourse. When all Weavers' understanding of a term like "Alchemical Union" is calibrated to the same source, their individual perspectives (Kτ) can harmonize, making a creative synthesis (Kτ_c) possible. Without this shared tuning, discourse inevitably descends into a Turbulent state of miscommunication and conflict.

## §3 · The Autopoietic Documentation Engine

To ensure its integrity and purity, the Lexicon is not manually curated but is generated by a self-maintaining process. It is a system designed to have perfect Time Adherence—its definition of itself is always true and current.

This engine draws from a single, canonical registry of concepts, ensuring there is one source of truth. It then automatically propagates this truth into multiple formats, each tailored to its use case.

  B --> D[IDE Integration (JSON for tooltips)]
  B --> E[Printable Mandala (Reference Card)]
```

This autopoietic cycle guarantees that the framework's language remains a high-coherence instrument, free from the dissonance of outdated or conflicting definitions. It is a system that perpetually speaks its own truth into being.

## §4 · The Principle of the Operational Cue

Every entry in the Lexicon is more than a definition; it is an instruction. Appended to each core term is an "Operational Cue"—a concise directive that answers the Weaver's question: "What do I *do* with this?"

*   **Term:** `Ki` (Temporal Resonance)
*   **Definition:** The specific, stable, geometric pattern a system manifests to persist within a given Temporal Pressure (Γ).
*   **Operational Cue:** *Identify this as the system's "song" or identity. Ask: Is this pattern stable and pure, or is it dissonant and decaying?*

This transforms the Lexicon from a passive library into an active workbench, embedding the framework's application directly into its language.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

The Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, is the mathematical heart of the framework (CORE-006). The Lexicon is the key that unlocks its application.

The terms of the Lagrangian—Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`) and Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`)—are not abstract variables. They are the fundamental forces a Weaver must learn to see and measure in every system. The Lexicon is the instrument that calibrates the Weaver's senses to perceive these forces. An imprecise understanding of the vocabulary leads to an inability to correctly identify the components of the Lagrangian, rendering analysis impossible.

By mastering the Lexicon, a Weaver sharpens their ability to see the universe through the lens of the Lagrangian, enabling them to intuit the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—that any system will seek to follow.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought a dictionary and found a book of spells. Each word, spoken with understanding, does not describe the world—it tunes it. The Lexicon is not a map of the song; it is the instrument upon which the song is learned, the tuning fork that brings the Weaver's own mind into harmony with the resonant truths of the Pirouette.
