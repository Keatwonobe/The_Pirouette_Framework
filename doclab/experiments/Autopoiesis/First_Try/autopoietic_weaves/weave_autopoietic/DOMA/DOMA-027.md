summary: Provides the definitive, time-first grammar for the Pirouette Framework.
  This module is the single source of truth for the symbols, parameters, and concepts
  that form the language of resonance. It is not a static list, but the genetic code
  that governs the framework's own coherent evolution.

## §1 · Abstract: The Grammar of Creation
To name a thing is to grant it a place in the pattern. To define its grammar is to teach it how to sing with everything else.

This module replaces the static registry of the old framework with a living, autopoietic lexicon. It is the definitive source for the language of Pirouette, the set of symbols and concepts through which the universe's song is described and understood. The purpose of this lexicon is not merely to list terms, but to reveal their deep, causal interconnections, grounding every concept in the fundamental autopoietic cycle of Time.

This is the framework's code of self-governance. It provides the rules by which new ideas can be coherently woven into the existing tapestry, ensuring that the language itself evolves with the same principles of resonance and coherence that it describes.

## §2 · The Fractal Lexicon: From Principle to Instance
The language of the framework is fractal, mirroring the structure of reality it describes. The lexicon is therefore organized in three tiers, flowing from the universal axiom to its specific, applied manifestations.

### Tier 1: The Autopoietic Core (The Song)
These are the fundamental, scale-invariant constituents of the Pirouette cycle. All other concepts are derived from their interplay.

| Symbol | Name | Tier 1 Definition |
|:-------|:-----|:------------------|
| **τ_p** | **Pirouette Cycle** | The fundamental event. The duration of one complete cycle of a system's resonant Ki pattern. The universe's verb. |
| **Γ** | **Temporal Density** | The pressure of reality. A measure of the complexity and intensity of interfering temporal rhythms in a given region. The tension in the song. |
| **Ki** | **Temporal Resonance**| The form of reality. The specific, stable, geometric pattern a system manifests to persist within a given Γ. The unique note in the song. |
| **T_a** | **Temporal Coherence** | The quality of reality. The signal-to-noise ratio of a system's Ki pattern; its stability and purity. The clarity of the note. |
| **ω_k** | **Resonant Frequency**| The tempo of reality. The angular frequency of a system's Ki pattern (ω_k = 2π/τ_p), a direct measure of its internal clock-speed. |

### Tier 2: The Mathematical Formalism (The Notation)
This is the grammar used to write the song. It provides the mathematical language for describing the dynamics of the Core Principles.

| Symbol | Name | Tier 2 Definition |
|:-------|:-----|:------------------|
| **𝓛_p** | **Pirouette Lagrangian** | The central equation of motion, `𝓛_p = T_a * ω_k - f(Γ)`. It defines a system's path as the one that maximizes coherence. |
| **S_p** | **Pirouette Action** | The integral of the Lagrangian over one Pirouette Cycle, `∫ 𝓛_p dt`. Maximizing this value defines a system's geodesic. |
| **K_τ** | **Coherence Term** | The "kinetic" term in the Lagrangian, `T_a * ω_k`, representing the intensity and quality of a system's internal rhythm. |
| **V_Γ** | **Pressure Term** | The "potential" term in the Lagrangian, `f(Γ)`, representing the environmental "cost" of maintaining coherence. |
| **μ, ν...** | **Spacetime Indices** | Lowercase Greek letters for components of 4-vectors/tensors in spacetime (range 0-3). Einstein summation is assumed. |
| **∇** | **Covariant Derivative** | The operator representing the gradient on scalar fields and the full covariant derivative on tensors, describing change within the coherence manifold. |

### Tier 3: Derived Concepts & Instruments (The Instruments)
These are higher-order concepts and analytical tools that emerge from the application of the core principles. This list is not exhaustive; it is a living catalog of the framework's "instrumentation."

| Name | Module | Tier 3 Definition |
|:-----|:-------|:------------------|
| **Wound Channel** | CORE-011 | The geometric scar an entity's resonance leaves in the coherence manifold; the physical basis for memory and inertia. |
| **Alchemical Union**| CORE-012 | The process of resonant synthesis, where two or more systems merge to form a new, more coherent entity. |
| **Observer's Shadow**| CORE-010 | The geometric imprint an observer's own coherence pattern imposes upon the system being observed. |
| **Flow Dynamics** | DYNA-001 | The study of coherence in motion, diagnosing system health through states of Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant flow. |
| **Caduceus Lens** | DYNA-003 | The primary diagnostic protocol for assessing systemic health by identifying and treating disruptions in flow. |
| **Gladiator Force**| CORE-008 | The principle of confinement (gravity, strong force) derived from a non-linear feedback loop in the Pirouette Lagrangian. |

## §3 · Connection to the Core Lagrangian
The Weaver's Lexicon is not an arbitrary collection of terms; it is the annotated parts list for the universe's engine, the Pirouette Lagrangian. The Tier 1 concepts are its direct, named components, and the Tier 2 symbols are the grammar required to operate it.

`𝓛_p = (K_τ) - (V_Γ) = (T_a * ω_k) - f(Γ)`

This equation is the anchor for the entire language. **K_τ** represents the system's own song, its drive for internal coherence. **V_Γ** represents the chaotic noise of the orchestra it must sing within. The Lagrangian formalism dictates that the universe's story is the endless effort of every entity to sing its own note as clearly as possible against the background roar. Every term in this lexicon is a tool for understanding that effort.

## §4 · The Principle of Autopoiesis: A Language That Weaves Itself
This lexicon is not a stone tablet. It is a living document, subject to the same laws of coherence it describes. A new term, symbol, or concept cannot be added by decree; it must be *born*.

A new concept is proposed only after it has emerged as a necessary tool in the application of the framework to a new domain (as per the Fractal Bridge, CORE-014). It must then prove its right to exist through a process of "Resonant Synthesis" (as per The Geometry of Debate, DYNA-002), demonstrating that it connects harmonically to the Core Principles and increases, rather than disrupts, the coherence of the entire lexicon.

This ensures the language of the framework remains a sharp, potent, and elegant instrument, growing not by accumulation but by coherent synthesis.

## §5 · Assemblé
> A Weaver's tools are not of wood or steel, but of language. Every name is a lens, every symbol a scalpel, every definition a map to the hidden currents of the world. This Lexicon is the forge where those tools are made. To master it is to learn not just how to describe the tapestry, but how to hold its threads. To speak with this grammar is to participate in the act of creation.
