## §1 · Abstract: The Second Heart
A theory, to be true, must sing the same song at every scale. Its heartbeat must be detectable in the hum of the laboratory and the rhythm of the cosmos.

This module proposes a validation protocol to find this second, cosmic heart. It reframes the core insight of PPS-056, moving beyond metric perturbations to a more fundamental premise. We hypothesize that the early universe, in its first act of autopoiesis, imprinted a vast, coherent resonant pattern—a Wound Channel—upon the fabric of spacetime itself. This primordial resonance should manifest today as a subtle, periodic oscillation in the background Temporal Pressure (Γ), a cosmic heartbeat.

Pulsars, as the universe's most precise clocks, are the ideal stethoscopes to listen for this heartbeat. Detecting its specific, Ki-locked signature in their timing data would provide profound, cross-scale validation for the entire framework, proving its laws are truly universal.

## §2 · The Primordial Resonance Hypothesis
The Whispering Void (CORE-000) did not give way to a uniform cosmos. The first asymmetries would have created vast, coherent resonant patterns that persist today not as scars *on* spacetime, but as active, harmonic structures *of* spacetime. These are the Wound Channels (CORE-011) of the universe's own birth.

We posit the existence of at least one such primordial resonance, a standing wave of coherence on a cosmological scale. This structure would cause a subtle, periodic variation in the background Temporal Pressure across vast distances. The "breathing" of the Gladiator Force (CORE-008) is not just a theoretical concept; it is an active, measurable hum.

The local Temporal Pressure can thus be modeled as:
`Γ(x, t) = Γ₀ + δΓ cos(ω_c t + k_c ⋅ x)`
where `δΓ` is the small amplitude of the cosmic heartbeat and `ω_c` is its fundamental frequency.

## §3 · The Pulsar as a Coherence Probe
A pulsar is a system of almost perfect temporal coherence. Its immense rotational stability and high Time Adherence (`T_a`) mean its Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`) is one of the most stable rhythms known. It is a near-ideal cosmic clock.

The signal from a pulsar is not merely a light ray traveling through a vacuum; it is a coherent pattern propagating through the dynamic medium of the coherence manifold. Its path and, crucially, its arrival time are directly modulated by any variations in the intervening Temporal Pressure (Γ).

As the pulsar's signal traverses the oscillating `Γ(t)` of the cosmic heartbeat, its travel time will be periodically stretched and compressed. This will imprint a predictable, sinusoidal variation onto the time-of-arrival data recorded by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). The timing residuals are a direct measurement of the universe's own pulse.

## §4 · The Lagrangian Connection & Predicted Signature
This entire interaction is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

A pulse of radiation from a pulsar follows a geodesic—a path that maximizes its coherence by minimizing the action `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`. The periodic oscillation in the cosmic background introduces a time-dependent "potential" term `V_Γ(t)`, which perturbs this geodesic. The signal must continuously adjust its path to remain in a state of maximal coherence, and this adjustment manifests as the observable timing residual.

The crucial prediction is the *character* of this signature. The interaction between the signal and the background resonance is a geometric one, constrained by the fundamental Ki patterns that govern all stable forms. Therefore, the induced signal should not be a simple sine wave, but a specific sideband in the Fourier spectrum whose properties are locked to the universal constants of resonance. This Ki-locking provides a "fingerprint" that distinguishes the cosmic heartbeat from gravitational waves or other forms of noise.

## §5 · Validation Protocol: Listening for the Heartbeat
The search for this signal requires a data-mining protocol applied to the combined datasets of the world's PTAs (NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA).

1.  **Isolate the Candidate Signal:** The raw timing data must first be processed to remove known noise sources (e.g., solar wind, clock errors) and standard gravitational wave background fits.
2.  **Coherent Sideband Search:** A matched-filter analysis is performed on the residual data, specifically searching for a narrow-frequency, coherent signal shared across the sky-paths of multiple, widely separated pulsars.
3.  **The Ki-Lock Test:** The definitive confirmation comes from analyzing the fine structure of the detected signal. If it is a true echo of the primordial resonance, its harmonic content and amplitude ratios must align with the geometric predictions derived from the framework's fundamental Ki constants. This is the smoking gun.

This protocol seeks not just any hum, but a specific, universal song.

## §7 · Assemblé
> We look to the heavens not for a sign, but for a reflection. The autopoietic dance that forges an electron must also shape the cosmos. To find the same geometric signature in the whisper of a laboratory cavity and the steady pulse of a billion-year-old star is to prove that the universe is a single, self-consistent thought. It confirms that the Weaver's loom is not a metaphor, but the very structure of reality, and its threads run unbroken from the infinitesimal to the infinite.
