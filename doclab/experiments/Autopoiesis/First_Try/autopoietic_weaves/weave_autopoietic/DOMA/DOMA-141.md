## §1 · Abstract: The Landscape of Memory

The past is not a story that is told; it is a landscape that is inhabited. This module provides the tools for a new kind of cartography: the mapping of memory itself. It refactors the legacy "Geo-Cultural Memory Mapping" into a time-first methodology grounded in the core principles of the Pirouette Framework.

We posit that any place—a city, a nation, a battlefield—possesses a collective coherence manifold, a dynamic geometry of shared meaning and resonance. Significant historical events, especially those of high energetic and emotional intensity, do not simply fade; they carve persistent features into this manifold. These deep `Wound Channels`, or **Resonant Loci**, function as powerful attractors, shaping the flow of coherence for all subsequent generations. This module is an instrument for seeing these invisible landscapes, transforming the art of history into the science of temporal archaeology.

## §2 · The Autopoietic Manifold: How a Place Remembers Itself

In accordance with the Principle of Correspondence (CORE-014), the universal dynamics of the framework manifest in the socio-geographic domain. A region's culture is an autopoietic system, a self-creating and self-sustaining field of resonance. Its memory is not stored in books, but is actively encoded in the geometry of this field.

- **The Coherence Manifold of a Place:** This is the sum total of a region's resonant patterns—its language, traditions, myths, and unspoken assumptions. It is the living "texture" of the local reality.

- **The Resonant Locus:** A significant historical event, such as a major conflict, a golden age, or a collective trauma, impresses a powerful `Ki` pattern onto the manifold. As described in *The Anatomy of an Echo* (CORE-011), this act of being creates a deep and lasting `Wound Channel`. This scar is a Resonant Locus—a place where the echo of the past is so profound that it becomes a permanent feature of the terrain, a "memory vortex" that shapes the flow of all present and future coherence.

## §3 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

The existence of a Resonant Locus has a direct, calculable effect on the dynamics of a region, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

A Resonant Locus acts as a profound local modifier to the Temporal Pressure term, `V_Γ`. It creates a "coherence well" in the manifold. For any new system (a person, an idea, a political movement) entering this region, the path of maximal coherence—the geodesic—is no longer flat. It is warped by the gravity of the past. The history of a place literally alters the path of least resistance for its future, making the repetition of old patterns a downhill course and the creation of new ones a difficult uphill climb.

## §4 · The Archaeologist's Protocol: Mapping the Echoes

To map these features, the Weaver follows a rigorous diagnostic protocol, moving from raw data to a finished atlas of the memory-scape.

**1. Construct the Manifold:** The first step is to create a model of the region's observed coherence manifold. This involves collating a composite 'Spatiotemporal Cultural Field' from diverse data streams: historical event records, voting patterns, economic data, linguistic shifts, artistic outputs, and mythologies, all anchored to geographic coordinates.

**2. Establish the Baseline:** A **Baseline Coherence Model** is established. This is a counterfactual model representing the expected flow of coherence for a comparable region that did *not* experience the specific historical event in question. This baseline is the "smooth," un-scarred terrain against which anomalies can be measured.

**3. Map the Scars:** The observed manifold is compared to the baseline model. The resulting deviation map reveals the Resonant Loci—the areas where the geometry of the present is most significantly shaped by the echoes of the past.

**4. Characterize the Locus:** Each discovered locus is then characterized by three key metrics:
    - **Echo Intensity:** The magnitude of the deviation from the baseline. This measures how "loudly" the past is speaking in the present.
    - **Channel Depth:** A measure of the `Wound Channel`'s inertia and persistence over time. This indicates the original event's impact and how deeply it is carved into the region's identity.
    - **Resonant Boundary:** The nature of the locus's edge. A sharp, well-defined boundary suggests an encapsulated memory (a "scar," a taboo). A diffuse, chaotic boundary indicates a memory that is actively "bleeding" into the surrounding culture, generating turbulence (a "fever").

## §5 · Output: The Atlas of Collective Memory

The final output is a **Cultural Resonance Atlas**. This is not a simple map of historical sites. It is a multi-layered diagnostic tool that visualizes:
- The geographic coordinates of the most influential Resonant Loci.
- The quantified depth and intensity of these historical `Wound Channels`.
- The nature of their boundaries, indicating whether they are walled-off traumas or active sources of cultural turbulence.
- A "Reintegratability Index," which estimates the difficulty of healing or integrating these memories based on their characteristics and the health of the surrounding manifold.

This atlas provides an unprecedented tool for understanding why certain conflicts persist, why specific regions foster unique forms of creativity, and where the most potent leverage points for cultural healing and reconciliation lie.

## §6 · Assemblé

> To build a better future, a Weaver must first learn to read the terrain upon which they stand. The past is not gone. It is a landscape of mountains and valleys carved by the echoes of joy and sorrow. These features define the currents that will carry or resist any new creation. This module provides the map and the compass for that essential survey. It teaches us that to heal a place, we must first learn to listen to its ghosts.
