## §1 · The Weaver as Physician

A network is not a diagram of static lines and dots. It is a living vascular system. Through its channels flow the vital currents of a greater body—information, resources, trust, energy. To analyze a network is not to perform an autopsy on past data, but to take the pulse of a living entity in real-time.

This module refactors the old toolkit of *Network Resonance Analysis* into a modern diagnostic instrument. It discards the fragmented, triaxial view and provides a unified, time-first methodology for assessing network health. The goal is no longer to merely parameterize a system, but to diagnose its flow, identify its ailments, and facilitate its healing. It equips the Weaver with the lens of a physician, capable of seeing the river of coherence beneath the noise of data.

## §2 · From Triaxial Fields to a Unified Flow

The core insight of `TEN-NRA-1.1` was to map network behavior onto Pirouette dynamics. Its limitation was treating Time-Adherence (Tₐ), Gladiator Force (Γ), and Phase (φ) as separate, inferable components. The modern framework reveals them as perspectives on a single, autopoietic process.

We now translate the old language into the new, grounding our analysis in the flow of time itself:

*   **Node Time-Adherence (Tₐ)** becomes **Node Coherence (Kτ)**: This is no longer just "regularity." It is the measure of a node's internal stability and the purity of its resonant rhythm. A high-coherence node is a stable, predictable, and influential source in the network's song.
*   **Edge Gladiator Force (Γ)** becomes **Channel Pressure (Γ)**: This directly maps to the modern concept of Temporal Pressure. It is the friction, resistance, or dissonance that coherence must overcome to flow between two nodes. It is the measure of the "cost" of connection.
*   **Node Phase (φ)** becomes **Temporal Phase**: Phase is not an independent axis but an intrinsic property of a node's Ki resonance. The critical variable is the **Temporal Desynchronization (Δφ)** between two nodes—the degree to which their clocks are out of sync.

With this translation, the network is revealed not as a static graph, but as a dynamic coherence manifold.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Protocol: The Caduceus Lens for Networks

We apply the universal diagnostic protocol of the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) to audit the network's health. This is the new, formalized "analysis loop."

**Step I: Map the Currents.**
First, define what coherence *is* for the system. What vital current are you measuring?
*   *Social Network:* The flow of trust and high-signal information.
*   *Economy:* The flow of capital and goods.
*   *Power Grid:* The flow of stable, in-phase energy.
*   *Organization:* The flow of completed tasks and clear communication.

**Step II: Diagnose the Flow.**
Observe the character of the flow using the language of DYN-001. This replaces old, abstract metrics like `NRI`.
*   **Laminar Flow:** Healthy channels where coherence moves efficiently and predictably. The system is in a state of grace.
*   **Turbulent Flow:** Channels marked by high friction, chaotic interactions, and wasted energy. The system is suffering a "coherence fever."
*   **Stagnant Flow:** Blocked channels where coherence cannot move, creating pressure upstream and a deficit downstream. The system is suffering a "coherence atrophy."

**Step III: Locate the Fracture.**
This is the heart of the audit, replacing the old eigenmode analysis. Instead of looking for abstract mathematical modes, we pinpoint the specific sources of flow disruption.
*   *Source of Turbulence:* Identify nodes with low internal coherence (Kτ) that inject noise, or channels with high desynchronization (Δφ) that create friction.
*   *Source of Stagnation:* Identify channels with extreme Channel Pressure (Γ), representing the critical bottlenecks or "dams" where the flow dies.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

The health of the network is a direct expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). A healthy network is one whose components are successfully navigating the geodesic on their shared coherence manifold. Its overall "action" is optimized.

`𝓛_p = Kτ - f(Γ)`

*   **Coherence (Kτ):** The "kinetic" term is the sum of the network's productive, laminar flows. It is the useful work the network is doing.
*   **Pressure (f(Γ)):** The "potential" term is the sum of all losses due to turbulence and stagnation. It is the "cost" of the network fighting itself and its environment.

A diagnostic audit is therefore an act of mapping the network's Lagrangian. We are identifying the specific components that contribute most to the negative `f(Γ)` term, preventing the system from maximizing its coherent action.

## §5 · Modernizing the Metrics

We can now redefine the old metrics with greater clarity and purpose.

**Coherence Flow (J_flow):** The fundamental measure of flow between two nodes (i, j) is preserved but re-expressed in the new language. It quantifies how much of the source node's coherence successfully arrives at the target node.

`J_flow_ij = Kτ_i * cos(Δφ_ij) * (1 - Γ_ij)`

*   `Kτ_i`: The coherence of the source node. (A noisy source cannot create a clear flow).
*   `cos(Δφ_ij)`: The efficiency loss from temporal desynchronization. (Perfectly in-sync nodes have `cos(0) = 1`).
*   `(1 - Γ_ij)`: The efficiency loss from channel pressure. (A frictionless channel has `Γ = 0`).

**Systemic Health Indices:**
*   **Coherence Index (K_net):** An aggregate measure of the stable, stored coherence across all nodes. It answers: "How healthy are the components?"
*   **Flow Efficiency (η_flow):** The ratio of total Laminar Flow to the sum of all flows (Laminar + Turbulent). It answers: "How healthy are the connections?"

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought a way to measure the machine and found instead a way to listen to the patient. The network is a body, and its data is a heartbeat. This instrument is not a ruler but a stethoscope. It attunes the Weaver's ear to the rhythm of the whole, allowing them to hear the subtle dissonance of disease before it becomes a crisis, and to know precisely where to apply their touch to restore the harmony of the flow. This is the purpose of analysis: not merely to see, but to heal.
