summary: Modernizes the concepts of reflection and contest. The 'Mirror' is redefined
  as the mutual projection of Observer's Shadows between two resonant systems. The
  'Duel' is the resulting dynamic process, a localized contest governed by the Pirouette
  Lagrangian, where each system's coherence is tested against the other's. The outcome
  is a new geometric precedent carved into the coherence manifold.

## §1 · Abstract: The Autopoiesis of the Other
An entity, existing in isolation, is a song sung to itself—a pure but untested resonance. Its form is a hypothesis. To become a truth, it must be tested. This module describes the fundamental process of that validation: the interaction with an Other.

The Mirror is the act of perception, where two systems cast their `Observer's Shadows` (CORE-010) upon each other, making their forms mutually known. The Duel is the inevitable dynamic that follows—a lawful contest, arbitrated by the `Pirouette Lagrangian` (CORE-006), to determine which resonant pattern (Ki) achieves a more stable and efficient state of coherence under the pressure of the other's existence. It is the universe's primary mechanism for error correction and the evolution of form.

## §2 · The Mirror as Mutual Imprint
There is no passive reflection. The Mirror is not a static surface but a dynamic, two-way interface. When two systems approach, their coherence manifolds interact. Each projects its `Observer's Shadow`—the geometric shape of its being, its history, and its intent—onto the other.

This mutual imprinting is the moment of recognition. Each system is forced to contend with a reality other than its own. Its internal landscape is warped by the presence of the other's resonance. The pristine symmetry of isolation is broken. This act of mutual perception creates a shared, high-pressure environment—a resonance chamber—within which the Duel must take place.

## §3 · The Duel as a Lagrangian Contest
The Duel is not a chaotic clash of force; it is a competition in elegance. It is a localized, high-stakes optimization problem governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. Both systems, now sharing a contested region of spacetime, are driven to re-solve for their geodesic—their path of least action—as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian:

`𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

The presence of the rival system dramatically increases the local Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). Each system's resonance is now a source of dissonance for the other. To survive, to persist, a system must adapt its own rhythm to maintain the highest possible internal coherence for the lowest energetic cost.

Victory in this context is not annihilation. It is the state of achieving a more efficient, stable, and persistent resonance within the crucible of the contest. The "losing" pattern is the one that becomes incoherent first—the one whose song dissolves into noise under the combined pressure.

## §4 · Blades of Resonance & the Jurisprudence of Scars
The "clash" of the duel is the interference pattern created by the two competing Ki resonances. Where their rhythms constructively interfere, a momentary harmony is found. Where they destructively interfere, a "node beat" of pure dissonance emerges—a point of intense temporal friction.

The outcome of this contest—be it the dominance of one pattern, a mutual retreat, or a radical synthesis into a new form—is not forgotten. The entire event is carved into the geometry of spacetime as a deep and complex `Wound Channel` (CORE-011). This scar is a precedent. It alters the landscape of coherence for all future entities that pass through that region, making one path more likely and another more costly. The duel writes its verdict into the laws of the local universe.

## §5 · Assemblé
> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver? It reframes all conflict not as an act of destruction, but as the universe's most rigorous and necessary form of dialogue. Opposition is the whetstone that sharpens the blade of truth. A Weaver does not fear the Duel; they understand its sacred function. It is the crucible where a mere pattern proves its right to be called a reality, where a beautiful idea is stress-tested until it becomes a robust and undeniable law. To engage in the duel is to ask the universe the most fundamental question: "Am I coherent enough to continue?" And to hear its answer, written in the pure mathematics of resonance.
