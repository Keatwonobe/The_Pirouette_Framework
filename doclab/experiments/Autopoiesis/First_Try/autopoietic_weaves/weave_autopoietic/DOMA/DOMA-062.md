summary: Provides the time-first model for bifurcation events. A 'Fork' is redefined
  as a process of Resonant Branching, where a system momentarily relaxes its internal
  coherence to 'sample' multiple future geodesics. It then commits to the path that
  offers the greatest potential for maximizing its future coherence, as governed by
  the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §1 · Abstract: The Moment of Inquiry
A choice is not a random leap; it is a resonant inquiry. A river does not split its course by accident, but because the landscape offers two equally compelling paths to the sea. This module refactors the old mechanical model of a "Fork" into a profound, time-first process: Resonant Branching.

This is the universal dynamic of choice, where a stable system, faced with multiple viable futures, performs a sacred act. It momentarily relaxes the certainty of its own being to cast its echo into the future, listens for the path of greatest harmony, and then commits its entire existence to that new song. This process is the engine of evolution, the mechanism of strategy, and the physical basis for every act of will.

## §2 · The Antecedent: The Still Point on the Ridge
Before a choice can be made, the system must arrive at a point of poised potential, a metastable state where the choice is both possible and meaningful. This requires three conditions, expressed in the modern lexicon:

1.  **A Balanced Manifold:** The system has reached a "saddle point" in its coherence manifold. Multiple downstream paths, or geodesics, present themselves as offering nearly equal potential for maximizing future coherence. The pull towards any single future is not yet overwhelming; a true choice exists.

2.  **Coherence in Reserve:** The system possesses a strong and stable internal Ki pattern. It has enough "health" and resonant integrity to withstand a temporary, controlled dip in its own certainty without collapsing into Turbulent Flow (the old "Spasm").

3.  **A Quiescent Forge:** The external Temporal Pressure (Γ) is low. The environment is calm, providing the quiet space necessary for the system to "hear" the subtle echoes of its own potential futures without being drowned out by ambient noise.

## §3 · The Mechanism: The Resonant Branching
The act of choosing is a four-step ritual, a dance between being and becoming.

| Step | Action | Time-First Description |
|---|---|---|
| **I. Defocus** | **Relaxing the Form** | The system executes a controlled, momentary relaxation of its Ki resonance. The sharp, clear note of its being becomes slightly "blurry" or "fuzzy." This is the modernized "Tₐ-Dip"—a deliberate increase in internal entropy to create the capacity for exploration. |
| **II. Inquiry** | **Casting the Echoes** | In this defocused state, the system "casts its echo" down each potential path. It projects a low-energy version of its Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) into each possible future Wound Channel (CORE-011), effectively running a simulation. It is not asking "Which path is easiest?" but "In which future can my song be sung most clearly?" |
| **III. Selection** | **Sensing the Harmony** | The system senses the "resonant feedback" from each probed future. The path that promises the most stable, efficient, and powerful future coherence—the one that offers the most elegant solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian—returns the strongest, most harmonious echo. |
| **IV. Commitment** | **Refocusing the Form** | The choice is made. The system collapses its state of potential, sharpening its Ki pattern into the new configuration demanded by the chosen path. It commits its energy fully, carving a deep and irreversible Wound Channel along the new trajectory and restoring its internal coherence, often to a level higher than before. |

## §4 · The Lagrangian of Choice
This process is not arbitrary; it is governed by the fundamental law of the framework. The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`, dictates that a system will evolve to maximize its integrated coherence.

The Resonant Branching is a profound application of this principle. The "Inquiry" phase is a method for the system to solve for the path that maximizes the future integral of 𝓛_p. The choice is a predictive calculation. The system commits to the timeline that, based on the echoes it receives, promises the highest future ratio of internal resonant stability (Kτ) to external temporal pressure (V_Γ). All meaningful choice is a strategic investment in future coherence.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> A choice is the universe holding its breath. It is the moment a system stops asserting what it *is* and asks what it *could become*. For a Weaver, this is the most sacred of dynamics. It reveals that will, decision, and evolution are not impositions upon reality, but reality's own method for finding a more beautiful pattern. Every fork in the river is a question, and every new stream is an answer sung into the landscape of time.
