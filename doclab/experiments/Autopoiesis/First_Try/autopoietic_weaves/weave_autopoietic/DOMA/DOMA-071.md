## §1 · Abstract: For a Theory to See

A theory without sense organs is a ghost, a formless abstraction. For the Pirouette Framework to live, to act, to participate in the world, it must learn to see. This module specifies the design for its eyes and ears.

The Coherence Engine is the universal instrumentation protocol for the framework. It moves beyond the legacy separation of `Tₐ`, `Γ`, and `Kᵢ` to a unified process directly grounded in the framework's central predictive equation: the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). This module defines a self-calibrating, verifiable method for measuring the two fundamental quantities that govern all dynamics: a system's internal `Temporal Coherence (Kτ)` and its external `Temporal Pressure (VΓ)`. It is the loom upon which the raw threads of reality are woven into the calculable fabric of coherence.

## §2 · The Engine's Architecture: Deconstructing the Lagrangian

The Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = Kτ - VΓ`) is the mathematical soul of the framework. To measure it is to measure the push and pull of existence itself. The Engine is architected around its two core terms.

### I. Measuring Kτ (Temporal Coherence): The System's Song

This "kinetic" term represents the quality and intensity of a system's own resonant identity—its unique song. It is a composite value, `Kτ = T_a * ω_k`, requiring the measurement of two distinct properties:

*   **Rhythm (ω_k):** A measure of the system's dominant resonant frequency (`ω_k = 2π/τ_p`). This is the fundamental pitch of the system's song.
    *   **Measurement Principle:** Spectral analysis (e.g., Fast Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform) of a relevant time-series signal to identify the peak power frequency. This is the system's heartbeat.

*   **Purity (T_a):** A measure of the signal-to-noise ratio of the system's rhythm. This is the clarity and stability of its note, its `Time Adherence`.
    *   **Measurement Principle:** Phase noise analysis or clock jitter measurement relative to the primary rhythm (ω_k). A system with high purity has low phase flicker and minimal drift; its note rings true.

### II. Measuring VΓ (Temporal Pressure): The Environmental Cacophony

This "potential" term represents the cost of being, the pressure exerted on the system by the complex temporal environment of the `Temporal Forge`. It is a function of the local `Temporal Density (Γ)`.

*   **Density (Γ):** A measure of the complexity and intensity of all interfering temporal rhythms in the system's local environment. This is the volume and dissonance of the background noise.
    *   **Measurement Principle:** Integrated Power Spectral Density across a wide bandwidth. A region of high Γ is a roaring cacophony of incommensurate frequencies. A region of low Γ is a placid hum.

## §3 · The Chain of Coherence: A Protocol for Trust

A measurement is not a fact; it is a claim. For that claim to be trusted, it must be forged in an unbroken, verifiable chain. This protocol ensures the integrity of every data point generated by the Coherence Engine.

1.  **The Anchor:** All measurements are traceable to a primary frequency standard (e.g., a cesium reference clock). This anchors the entire chain to a known, stable rhythm.

2.  **The Hush:** Before measurement, each instrument performs a self-diagnostic in a shielded environment (a "Faraday hush") to establish a baseline noise floor. This ensures the instrument is listening to the world, not just the sound of its own operation.

3.  **The Chorus:** In multi-instrument deployments, devices continuously cross-validate by observing a shared reference signal. Mismatches are flagged, and the network dynamically adjusts calibration, forming a self-healing consensus.

4.  **The Engram:** Each calibrated measurement snapshot—`{Kτ, VΓ, timestamp, calibration_id}`—is cryptographically signed and committed to an immutable ledger via a standardized API. This creates a permanent, tamper-proof record of observation, the foundational `Measurement Registry` for all higher-order analysis.

## §4 · The Lagrangian Connection

This module's purpose is to make the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) a predictive, physical tool. The Coherence Engine provides the essential input: a continuous stream of `(Kτ, VΓ)` tuples.

By feeding this time-series into the Euler-Lagrange equation, a Weaver can solve for the system's geodesic—its path of maximal coherence. This allows for:

*   **Diagnosis:** Identifying deviations from the optimal path (i.e., turbulence or stagnation).
*   **Prediction:** Forecasting the system's most probable future state.
*   **Intervention:** Calculating the precise energetic or informational input required to guide the system back to a more coherent trajectory.

The Coherence Engine transforms the Lagrangian from a principle into a calculator.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We sought the sense organs of a living universe. We found the design for a tuning fork and a microphone. The first measures the purity of a single note—the song of a thing being itself. The second measures the encompassing noise of the foundry in which that note must be sung. With these two simple readings, the entire symphony of existence can be scored, its past understood, and its future composed. This is how a Weaver learns to listen.
