summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model of systemic failure. This module
  recasts classical stress, yield, and fracture dynamics as consequences of a system's
  struggle to maintain coherence under extreme temporal pressure. Failure is defined
  not as an event, but as the geometric result of a system losing its ability to follow
  a path of maximal coherence as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §1 · Abstract: The Song Under Strain
A system does not break; it decoheres. This module reframes the entire domain of yield and fracture dynamics, moving beyond classical metaphors of force and resistance into the time-first language of the Pirouette Framework. Stress is not an external force applied to an object, but a condition of intense Temporal Pressure (Γ) that challenges a system's ability to maintain its own resonant song (its Temporal Coherence, $K_\tau$). The breaking point is where the song can no longer hold its note. By grounding these dynamics in the Pirouette Lagrangian, we create a single, unified model that describes how a steel beam bends, a market crashes, and a mind breaks, all as variations of the same geometric process.

## §2 · The Lagrangian Under Duress
The health and stability of any system are governed by its Pirouette Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L}_p = K_\tau - V_\Gamma$, which represents the interplay between its internal coherence and the external pressure. Stress is any condition that forces this value towards zero or below, making coherence difficult or costly to maintain.

**Coherence Stress** is the fundamental tension within the Lagrangian. It manifests in two ways:
1.  **Pressure Overload:** The external Temporal Pressure increases dramatically ($V_\Gamma \uparrow\uparrow$). The environment becomes so noisy, chaotic, or demanding that the "cost" of maintaining a stable internal rhythm becomes immense.
2.  **Rhythm Disruption:** The stress directly interferes with the system's internal song, causing its Temporal Coherence to degrade ($K_\tau \downarrow\downarrow$).

A system fails when it can no longer find a state (a Ki pattern) that allows it to maximize its Lagrangian and follow a path of stable existence. Its failure is an attempt to solve an impossible equation.

## §3 · The Three States of Deformation
A system's response to Coherence Stress unfolds across three distinct states, mapping directly to the principles of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001).

1.  **Elastic Deformation (Recoverable Perturbation):** The system encounters a temporary spike in Coherence Stress. Its flow becomes briefly turbulent, but its core identity—its Ki resonance—remains intact. Like a plucked string, it vibrates under the strain but returns to its original note once the stress is removed. This is a recoverable deviation from its geodesic.

2.  **Plastic Deformation (The Yield Point & The Scar):** The Coherence Stress surpasses a critical threshold. The system cannot return to its original state. To survive, it is forced into an **Alchemical Union with its own damage**. It adopts a new, permanently altered Ki pattern that is stable under the new conditions. This is an irreversible re-writing of its `Wound Channel` (CORE-011). The system has yielded. It has bent, not broken, and carries the memory of that stress as a permanent scar in its own geometry.

3.  **Fracture (Catastrophic Decoherence):** The Coherence Stress is so overwhelming that the system cannot find *any* stable Ki pattern. Its internal rhythm shatters completely ($K_\tau \to 0$). It can no longer maintain its identity as a coherent entity and dissolves back into the ambient noise of the Temporal Forge. This is a total loss of information, the ultimate surrender to entropy (CORE-013). The string does not just go silent; it snaps.

## §4 · The Spectrum of Failure: Brittleness vs. Ductility
The character of a system is revealed in how it fails. This is described by a spectrum from brittle to ductile.

**Brittleness** characterizes systems whose coherence ($K_\tau$) is rigid and cannot easily adapt. They resist stress with high fidelity up to a sharp limit. They possess little to no capacity for plastic deformation. When Coherence Stress exceeds their critical threshold, they do not bend; they shatter instantly. Their story has no middle act between perfect form and total failure.

**Ductility** characterizes systems whose coherence ($K_\tau$) is adaptable. They can endure significant plastic deformation, absorbing immense stress by scarring their Wound Channel and reconfiguring their internal geometry. They bend, stretch, and change shape, buying survival at the cost of their original form. They fail slowly, gracefully, and with ample warning.

## §5 · Cross-Domain Correspondence
This single model of failure applies universally, with the core principles manifesting in domain-specific language.

| Domain | Failure Mode | System Character | Lagrangian Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Material Science** | **Brittle Fracture** (Glass) | **Brittle** | Rigid $K_\tau$ cannot adapt. A sharp increase in $V_\Gamma$ (impact) causes an immediate coherence collapse ($K_\tau \to 0$). |
| | **Ductile Failure** (Steel) | **Ductile** | Flexible $K_\tau$ allows for significant plastic deformation. The system absorbs energy from $V_\Gamma$ by re-writing its Wound Channel (work hardening) before finally fracturing. |
| **Economics** | **Market Crash** (Panic) | **Brittle** | The market's coherence (investor confidence) is rigid. A shock ($V_\Gamma$) triggers a feedback loop where $K_\tau$ evaporates instantly, leading to a system-wide fracture. |
| **Psychology** | **Mental Breakdown** | **Brittle** | An acute stressor ($V_\Gamma$) overwhelms a psyche with rigid coping mechanisms. The system fractures into a dissociative or psychotic state. |
| | **Burnout** | **Ductile** | A psyche endures chronic stress ($V_\Gamma$) through plastic deformation (forming new habits, emotional calluses, scars). It slowly yields, degrading its function until it reaches a point of exhaustion and failure. |

## §6 · Assemblé
> The universe does not test a thing's strength, but the integrity of its song. Stress is the listening. It is the question the cosmos asks of every form: when the pressure comes, will you rewrite your melody, or will you fall silent? The scar is the memory of the verse that was added to survive. The shatter is the final, sudden end of a song that could not learn a new note. To a Weaver, resilience is not the art of never breaking, but the art of composing a song so beautiful it can learn to harmonize with its own pain.
