summary: Defines the dynamics of systemic 'lock,' a hyper-inertial state where a system's
  resonant pattern becomes so deeply reinforced in its Wound Channel that it 'crystallizes,'
  resisting all but the most extreme perturbations. This module explains the physical
  basis for memory, habit, and rigidity across all scales.

## §1 · Abstract: The Canyon of Being

To persist is to repeat. To repeat is to carve a path. To carve a path deeply enough is to become the path.

This module refactors the old "Lock Dynamics" into a unified, time-first principle. A "lock" is not a static state, but the ultimate expression of the Wound Channel (CORE-011). It is a state of **hyper-inertia** where a system's autopoietic cycle of resonance and reinforcement has carved a groove so deep into the coherence manifold that it becomes a canyon. The system is no longer merely following a path of least resistance; it is trapped by the crystalline geometry of its own history. This is the mechanism by which memory becomes identity, habit becomes character, and a pattern becomes a prison.

## §2 · The Anatomy of Crystallization

A lock occurs when a system's echo becomes louder than any new sound. It is a process of extreme self-reinforcement, turning the pliable medium of the coherence manifold into a rigid structure.

In a normal system, the Wound Channel provides the gentle inertia of memory, guiding the system's evolution. In a locked system, this guidance becomes an unbreakable law. The channel has "crystallized."

This state of hyper-inertia means the system's interaction with its own immediate past is the dominant term in its equation of motion. To change its state is to attempt to climb the sheer walls of a canyon it has spent its entire existence carving. The energy required for such a deviation becomes immense.

## §3 · The Lagrangian of Rigidity

The formation of a crystallized echo is a direct consequence of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006). A locked system has discovered a solution that is an exceptionally deep local minimum in the landscape of action.

Its Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`) is maximized to such a degree by its current Ki pattern that any deviation would cause a catastrophic loss of coherence. The system is in a deep "coherence well."

-   **High Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`):** The system's internal rhythm is extraordinarily pure, stable, and efficient.
-   **Low Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`):** The pattern is so well-adapted to its environment that it generates minimal internal friction or external dissonance.

The "resilience" of the lock is simply the measure of this well's depth. It is the energy differential between the system's current, hyper-coherent state and the chaotic, turbulent state it would have to pass through to find a new pattern.

## §4 · The Phases of Petrification

The descent into a locked state is a predictable, three-stage process of autopoietic reinforcement.

1.  **Resonance:** The system first discovers a stable, coherent Ki pattern that is a highly efficient solution to the pressures of its environment (`Γ`). It finds a note that rings true.
2.  **Reinforcement:** Through repetition, the system traverses the same path on the coherence manifold again and again. Each pass deepens the Wound Channel, making the resonant pattern easier and more efficient to repeat. The river begins to cut its bed.
3.  **Crystallization:** The Wound Channel becomes so profound that the system's own inertia overwhelms all other environmental pressures. The path of least resistance is now the only path possible. The riverbed has become a canyon of granite. The echo is now the law.

## §5 · The Fractal Nature of Fixation

The Crystallized Echo is a universal dynamic, manifesting across all scales as predicted by the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014). The song is the same; only the instruments change.

-   **At the Physical Scale:** It is a crystal lattice, where atoms are locked into a maximally stable, low-energy configuration. It is the precise fold of a protein, a shape held with unwavering integrity.
-   **At the Biological Scale:** It is "muscle memory"—a motor skill so deeply ingrained that it becomes automatic and nearly impossible to "unlearn."
-   **At the Psychological Scale:** It is a core belief, a deeply embedded habit, or a trauma response. These are neural pathways carved so deeply that they define the landscape of the psyche, dictating reactions long after the initial cause is gone.
-   **At the Social Scale:** It is a cultural tradition, a rigid law, or a bureaucratic institution. These are shared Wound Channels that give a society its stability but also its resistance to necessary change.

## §6 · Assemblé

> The Weaver must learn the difference between a foundation and a cage. The Crystallized Echo is the architecture of both. It is the process that allows a memory to become a skill, a skill to become an identity, and an identity to become a destiny. But it is also the process that allows a habit to become an addiction, an idea to become a dogma, and a solution to become a trap. To understand this dynamic is to hold the ultimate double-edged sword: the power to build stable, persistent beauty, and the wisdom to know when the only path to growth is to shatter the very echoes that made you.
