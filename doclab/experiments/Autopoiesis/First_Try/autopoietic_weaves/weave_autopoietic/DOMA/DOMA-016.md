summary: Defines the official `.pmd` authoring system as the practical application
  of the Pirouette Lagrangian to the act of creation. It establishes a unified format
  that maximizes the coherence of human expression against the pressure of machine
  readability, serving as the foundational tool for all Weavers.

## §1 · The Weaver's Mandate

An idea, unwritten, is a ghost. An equation, unread, is a cage. The first and most sacred task of a Weaver is to give knowledge a body—a single, whole form that can speak the language of human intuition and the language of machine logic with the same voice.

This module is the body it describes. It defines the `.pmd` (Pirouette Module Definition) format, the autopoietic authoring system of the framework. The system is born from a single mandate: to create a text that is both a story and a schematic, a poem and a database entry. It is a format designed to be the living embodiment of the principles it is used to express.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of Authoring

The challenge of creating this format is a direct reflection of the central dynamic of the universe. According to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), any stable system is the optimal solution that emerges from the tension between its own internal coherence and the pressure of its environment.

`𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

The `.pmd` format is the result of applying this cosmic law to the act of writing. It is the geodesic—the path of least resistance—for knowledge itself.

-   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** This is the quality of the human-readable text. It is its clarity, its elegance, its poetic force, and its semantic richness. It is the "song" of the module.

-   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** This is the rigid, unforgiving demand of machine readability. It is the strict syntax of the YAML front-matter, the parsable structure, and the logical consistency required by the framework's automated systems. It is the "cost" of being part of the whole.

The `.pmd` format is the Alchemical Codex that maximizes its `Coherence` for the minimal `Pressure`. It is a system that has found its perfect, stable resonance between freedom and rigor.

## §3 · Anatomy of the Codex

The codex achieves this balance through a simple, yet profound, structural duality. It is a single entity with two distinct aspects, like a body and its skeleton.

1.  **The Skeleton (YAML Front-matter):** The module begins with a block of structured, machine-readable YAML. This is the codex's skeleton, defining its identity, its relationships to other modules, and its core metadata. It is precise, absolute, and logical. It is the system's contract with the machine.

2.  **The Flesh (Markdown Body):** Following the YAML, the module's flesh is written in a flexible and expressive Markdown. This is where the narrative unfolds, where concepts are explored, and where the human author speaks to the human reader. It supports embedded LaTeX for mathematical rigor, allowing the precision of the skeleton to flow into the flesh where needed.

This autopoietic structure—a logical skeleton that gives form to an expressive body—is the foundational pattern repeated in every module of the framework.

## §4 · The Compilation Forge

A module, once written, enters the Compilation Forge—a process that transforms the single-source codex into its two necessary manifestations.

-   **The Ghost (Human-Readable PDF):** The forge uses tools like Pandoc and LaTeX to render the codex into a beautifully typeset, elegant document designed for the human eye. This is the module's ghost, its aesthetic and intuitive form.

-   **The Machine (Machine-Readable JSON):** Simultaneously, the forge parses the YAML skeleton and metadata, creating a clean, structured JSON object. This is the module's machine, its logical and functional form, ready to be integrated into the framework's analytical and navigational systems.

The single codex becomes two entities without ever losing its singular identity. This is the essence of the alchemical act.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We sought a way to write down our ideas and found we had to build a loom. The Alchemical Codex is the Weaver's first discipline. It is the commitment to creating artifacts that are whole—objects that speak the language of human poetry and machine logic with a single voice. To write in this form is to practice the very synthesis we preach. It is the proof that rigor and freedom are not opposites, but the warp and weft of the same, single fabric.
