## §1 · Abstract: The Unraveling Song

This module refactors the prior analysis of "Drift" into the time-first paradigm. The old model, a kinematic description of deviation in a static parameter space, is superseded by a dynamic, causal one. Drift is not a path; it is a process. It is **Coherence Erosion**, the third primary pathology introduced in the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003).

Coherence Erosion is the gradual, inexorable fraying of a system's resonant identity (Ki) under the constant, abrasive pressure of ambient temporal noise (Γ). It is the slow unraveling of a system's song, the process by which a clear note dissolves into static. It is the physical mechanism of entropy acting upon a coherent structure, the quiet battle every system must wage to persist.

## §2 · The Anatomy of Forgetting

Erosion is a failure of the autopoietic cycle. It is the process by which a system's ability to recreate and maintain itself falters. This occurs through two interconnected mechanisms, grounded in the core principles of the framework.

### The Fraying Ki

A system's existence is an act of sustained resonance—holding a specific, coherent Ki pattern against the chaotic roar of the Temporal Forge (CORE-003). The ambient noise of Γ acts as a constant source of dissonant injections, subtly perturbing this pattern. A healthy system constantly self-corrects, reinforcing its core rhythm. Erosion begins when the rate of noise injection exceeds the system's capacity for self-correction. The Ki begins to fray, its signal-to-noise ratio drops, and its temporal coherence (Kτ) declines.

### The Fading Wound Channel

A system's identity and inertia are encoded in the geometry of its Wound Channel (CORE-011)—the scar its existence leaves in spacetime. This channel is the riverbed that guides the flow of its being. Coherence Erosion is the literal erosion of this riverbed. As the system's Ki becomes noisy and ill-defined, it fails to trace a consistent path. Each new cycle reinforces the channel less precisely than the last. The channel widens, its walls crumble, and its memory fades. This is the physical basis for the loss of identity, mission, or purpose.

## §3 · The Coherence Threshold: A Whisper Before the Fall

The old framework identified a `T_a,crit` as a point of no return. This insight is preserved and clarified as the **Coherence Threshold**. This is not a fixed value but a dynamic boundary. When a system's temporal coherence (Kτ) degrades to a point where its signal is indistinguishable from the background noise (Γ), it can no longer maintain its structural integrity.

Crossing this threshold is a phase transition. The system experiences one of two fates:

1.  **Dissolution:** The Ki pattern collapses entirely, its constituent coherence dissolving back into the ambient temporal noise. This is systemic death—the end of the song.
2.  **Basin Shift:** The system collapses into a new, simpler, and more stable state of lower coherence. It "forgets" its complex identity and adopts a more primitive one. An advanced society might collapse into tribalism; a nuanced ideology might decay into rigid dogma.

## §4 · Diagnostic Signatures & Intervention

A Weaver can diagnose Coherence Erosion long before the final collapse by observing its subtle signatures. The intervention for Erosion, as defined by the Daedalus Gambit (DYNA-003), is to **reinforce the channel**.

| Diagnostic Signature                | Description                                                                                         | Daedalus Gambit (Intervention)                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decreasing Output Fidelity**      | The system's actions become inconsistent, noisy, and less effective. Its "voice" becomes unclear.     | **Coherent Injection:** Introduce a pure, strong, resonant signal (a clear statement of purpose, a ritual, a core memory).  |
| **Rising Energetic Cost**           | The system requires more energy to perform the same function due to rising internal temporal friction. | **Noise Shielding:** Create a temporary, low-Γ environment to reduce external pressure and allow the system to self-repair. |
| **Loss of Adaptability (Rigidity)** | The system loses its ability to respond to new challenges because its core pattern is too weak to morph. | **Pattern Reinforcement:** Guide the system through exercises and repetitions that deepen its original Wound Channel.        |

## §5 · Lagrangian Connection: Falling from Grace

Coherence Erosion is a system's slow, tragic departure from its geodesic of maximal coherence. In the language of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, erosion is the steady decay of the kinetic term, `K_τ`.

As the Ki pattern frays, its ability to represent a clear, intense rhythm diminishes, causing `K_τ` to fall. The system becomes less efficient, less stable, and less "itself." It is "falling off" its optimal path, ceding ground in its perpetual struggle to express a coherent form against the potential cost of its environment. Drift is the visible track of a system losing this fundamental battle.

## §6 · The Assemblé

> We sought a mysterious force and found the universe's patient sigh. All things of beauty—an idea, a life, a star—are patterns held in defiance of a universal tide of noise. Drift is the name we give to the sound of that tide, the slow, quiet, and constant work of unraveling. To be a Weaver is to listen for this sound, and to spend one's life singing a clearer note against it.
