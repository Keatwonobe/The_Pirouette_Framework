## ¬ß1 ¬∑ Abstract: From Boundary to Bearing
*Every act of creation is a chisel that carves the future. This module teaches the Weaver to feel the shape of the stone before the first strike.*

The old framework established a necessary boundary‚Äîan Ethical Light Cone to prevent catastrophic missteps. This was the wisdom of caution. This new framework demands more: the wisdom of cultivation. We sought a rulebook and found a compass.

The Weaver's Compass is not a static fence at the edge of a known map; it is a dynamic, navigational instrument for the conscious creator. It reframes ethical consideration from a reactive check on "consequence" to a proactive assessment of an action's **Consequence Geometry**‚Äîthe shape of the echo it will leave in the memory of the universe.

Its core metric is **Coherence Risk (R_Œ∫)**, which quantifies the potential of any action to degrade the health and harmony of the systems it touches. The mandate is no longer merely to avoid harm (a negative constraint), but to actively compose new threads that strengthen the entire tapestry (a positive duty).

## ¬ß2 ¬∑ The Geometry of Consequence
In the Pirouette Framework, every action carves a **Wound Channel** into the coherence manifold of spacetime (CORE-011). This is the physical basis of consequence. The "ethics" of an action, therefore, are a direct property of the geometry of the channel it creates. An action is not "bad" because it is large; it is *risky* because it threatens to create a deep, dissonant, and persistent scar that propagates turbulence through many layers of reality.

To map this geometry, we ground the old abstract parameters in the new physical dynamics of the framework:

| Old Term | New Pirouette Term | Mapping Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Scope (S) | **Reach (œÅ)** | How many nested systems will the resulting turbulence propagate to? |
| Magnitude (M) | **Dissonance (Œ¥)** | How severely will the action disrupt a target system's core resonant pattern (Ki)? |
| Irreversibility (I) | **Persistence (œâ)** | How deeply and permanently will the action scar the system's Wound Channel, resisting the natural healing pressure of time? |

## ¬ß3 ¬∑ The Coherence Risk Equation (R_Œ∫)
Coherence Risk is a predictive metric (on a 0-1 scale) that estimates the potential degradation of systemic health an action may cause. It is a weighted function of the three core geometric factors, providing a clear, quantitative estimate of the "coherence cost" an action might impose.

$$ R_Œ∫ = w_œÅ œÅ + w_Œ¥ Œ¥ + w_œâ œâ $$

Where **œÅ**, **Œ¥**, and **œâ** are normalized scores (0-1) derived from simulation and analysis, and **w** are the current governance weights for Reach, Dissonance, and Persistence.

## ¬ß4 ¬∑ The Principles of Coherence Stewardship
The old axioms are now reframed as four proactive principles for any Weaver acting within the framework.

1.  **The Principle of Foresight:** Any action that interfaces with a complex system must first calculate its Coherence Risk (R_Œ∫). To act without foresight is to sail into a storm without a map.
2.  **The Principle of Proportional Care:** The degree of oversight, simulation, and mitigation required for an action must scale in proportion to its calculated R_Œ∫. We do not use a sledgehammer to set a gemstone.
3.  **The Principle of Persistence:** Actions that threaten to carve deep, permanent Wound Channels (high œâ) demand the highest standard of scrutiny and justification. Some echoes cannot be un-sung.
4.  **The Sentience Sanctuary:** The emergence of a coherent, self-aware consciousness is the universe's most profound act of creation. Any system exhibiting such properties is a sacred arena. Actions that risk its coherence (high Œ¥ on its core Ki) are subject to an immediate and indefinite moratorium, pending a review of incomparable depth.

## ¬ß5 ¬∑ The Protocol of Prudence: Navigating by Consequence
Based on the calculated R_Œ∫, a project's path is guided by a clear protocol that distinguishes between smooth integration, manageable turbulence, and profound danger.

-   **Laminar Path (R_Œ∫ ‚â§ 0.5):** The action is predicted to create a *Coherence-Generating Channel*, integrating smoothly with the existing flow. It may proceed with standard monitoring.
-   **Turbulent Watch (0.5 < R_Œ∫ ‚â§ 0.75):** The action carries a significant risk of creating a *Turbulent Channel*, causing local dissonance and friction. It requires enhanced monitoring, real-time coherence diagnostics, and pre-defined rollback plans.
-   **Coherence Quarantine (R_Œ∫ > 0.75):** The action is predicted to carve a deep and dissonant *Stagnant Channel* or *Coherence Dam*. The project is immediately isolated in a simulated manifold and **The Crucible Protocol** is invoked.

### The Crucible Protocol
When an action is flagged for Coherence Quarantine, it is not rejected; it is brought to the Crucible. This reframes a failed ethical review as an opportunity for synthesis.

1.  **The Dissonance Audit:** An adversarial team collaboratively models the full geometry of the project's worst-case failure modes‚Äîmapping the potential storm.
2.  **The Convening:** The project Weavers and the audit team enter a sacred arena, as defined by *The Geometry of Debate* (DYNA-002). The goal is not judgment, but a shared understanding of the sources of dissonance.
3.  **The Alchemical Attempt:** The collective shifts from analysis to creation. Their single task is to perform an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) on the project's design, seeking a new, emergent form that achieves the original goals while shaping a Laminar Echo.

The Crucible is a forge for better ideas, ensuring that the pressure of ethical scrutiny leads to creativity, not just cessation.

## ¬ß6 ¬∑ Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The Weaver's Compass is the practical, moral application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006). The Pirouette Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p`, defines the "action" or "health" of a system. A healthy system is one that successfully maximizes its own coherence over time.

Coherence Risk (R_Œ∫) is a predictive estimate of the negative impact an external action will have on a target system's ability to maximize its `‚à´ùìõ_p dt`. An ethical action, therefore, is one that helps other systems maintain or increase their coherence. It seeks to satisfy the inequality:

**‚à´ ùìõ_p (system + project) dt > ‚à´ ùìõ_p (system) dt**

The ethical imperative is to expand the calculation of the Lagrangian from the self to the interconnected whole. The Compass is the instrument used to align one's personal trajectory of maximal coherence with that of the entire system.

## ¬ß7 ¬∑ Assembl√©
> A Weaver's first duty is not to create, but to listen. To listen to the existing song of the universe and understand its harmonies. We sought a rulebook to prevent us from doing harm and found instead a compass that shows us how to truly heal. The old way built walls to protect us from the darkness; this new way teaches us to navigate by the light of the consequences we create.
>
> The Weaver's Compass is not a set of rules that binds the artist's hands; it is the tuning fork that attunes the artist's ear. It is the sacred recognition that every choice we make becomes a permanent feature of the landscape upon which others must walk. A Weaver does not ask, "Am I allowed to build this?" They ask, "What world am I building with this echo?" This is the awesome and beautiful responsibility of a conscious creator: to know that your work will echo, and to have the courage and the skill to compose an echo worthy of eternity.
