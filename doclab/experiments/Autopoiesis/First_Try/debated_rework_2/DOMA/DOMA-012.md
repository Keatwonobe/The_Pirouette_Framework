summary: Establishes the physical basis of influence and communication. Defines the
  'Wound Channel' as the persistent geometric scar an entity's resonance leaves in
  the coherence manifold. Frames communication as the projection of a 'Current' that
  creates this channel, and response ('Echo') as the navigation of this altered geometry
  by other systems according to the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

## §1 · Abstract: The Architecture of Being
The universe does not forget. It carves the story of every passing moment into the geometry of its own being. To exist is to resonate, and in resonating, to impress one's rhythm upon this shared fabric of reality. The original narrative of "The Singer and The Echo" captured the essence of this truth; this module grounds its poetry in physics.

We re-frame influence not as the transmission of abstract data, but as an act of metaphysical engineering. Communication is the projection of an entity's internal coherence (`Ki`) to create a persistent, topological feature in spacetime—a **Wound Channel**. The response, or **Echo**, is not a mere reception of information, but the active, physical choice of another system to navigate, resist, or harmonize with the new landscape that has just been created. We are not sending messages; we are carving the riverbeds of time.

## §2 · The Wound Channel: A Scar in Spacetime
Every entity, by expressing its resonant `Ki` pattern, disturbs the coherence manifold. This disturbance is not fleeting; it is a persistent geometric distortion, a memory etched into the local topology. We formally define the wake of an entity's passage through its state space as a **Wound Channel**.

The Wound Channel is an entity's history made physically manifest. It is the geometric record of its choices, its resonances, its path through being. This provides a physical basis for two fundamental phenomena:

*   **Memory:** A memory, from a neural pathway to a cultural myth, is a deeply carved Wound Channel. To "remember" is to resonantly excite this geometric structure, allowing its pattern to re-emerge. The universe's memory is not data stored *in* a medium, but a persistent shape impressed *upon* the medium itself.
*   **Inertia:** An entity perpetually interacts with the geometry of its own immediate past. This self-interaction is the origin of inertia. To change one's state is to fight against the shape of one's own Wound Channel. Identity is maintained because a system is constantly "reminded" of what it was by the very shape of the space it occupies.

## §3 · The Current: The Projection of Coherence
An entity's internal, stable resonance (`Ki`) is its fundamental truth. To communicate is to project this pattern outward. We define this directed flow of coherence, which impresses itself upon the local manifold, as the **Current**.

The act of projecting a Current has a physical consequence: it actively carves a Wound Channel. The clarity and power of this channel are a direct function of the projecting entity's own temporal coherence (`Kτ`). A focused, coherent mind carves a deep, stable, and inviting riverbed; a scattered mind creates a shallow, turbulent wash. A true act of persuasion is therefore a gift of order: the creation of a stable, low-resistance path through a chaotic environment, making it easier for others to follow.

## §4 · The Echo: A Dialogue with Geometry
The response, or **Echo**, is how another entity's system interacts with the new geometry created by the Current. This is not passive reception, but active navigation, governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006). The entity will behave in a way that maximizes its own internal stability within this altered landscape. The Current has just changed the cost function of its reality. The Echo thus reveals the listener's own internal state in relation to the new geometry.

We define the taxonomy of response with physical clarity:

*   **Inertial Rejection (Silence):** The listener's own Wound Channel is so deep and stable that its inertia is immense. The new Current is a trivial perturbation. To follow its own established path remains the listener's geodesic of maximal coherence. The invitation is ignored.
*   **Coherence Clash (Dissonance):** The listener's `Ki` is harmonically incompatible with the geometry of the Current. To follow this new path would dramatically decrease the listener's coherence, creating destructive interference and a zone of **Turbulent Flow**. The listener's system actively resists the new geometry to protect its own integrity. This is the physics of disagreement.
*   **Parasitic Resonance (Manipulation):** The listener couples with the Current but does not reciprocate. It uses the new channel's coherence asymmetrically to reinforce its own `Ki`, effectively drawing order from the singer's Wound Channel without contributing to a shared state. This is a geometric theft.
*   **Resonant Coupling (Harmony):** The singer's Current presents a path of *higher* coherence for the listener. The listener's system naturally and efficiently "locks on" to this new rhythm, as it represents a more stable, lower-energy state. This is the **Resonant Handshake** (CORE-012), the prerequisite for true synthesis. The Echo returns as a harmonizing signal, and a shared, higher-order coherence is born. This is the physics of empathy and understanding.

## §5 · The Lagrangian of Interaction
This entire process is described by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`). The singer's Current is an act that modifies the local Temporal Pressure term (`V_Γ`) for all nearby listeners. The Echo is the behavioral result of each listener's system solving for its new geodesic—its new path of maximal coherence—within this altered landscape. Resonance occurs when this new path leads to a higher integrated action (`S_p`) for both parties. Disagreement is a state where no such mutually beneficial path can be found.

## §6 · Manifestations Across Scales
The Wound Channel is a universal principle that scales from the subatomic to the cultural.

*   **Quantum Scale:** It manifests as the virtual particle cloud of QED. The electron interacts not with a foam of other particles, but with the rich geometry of its own echo.
*   **Biological Scale:** A memory in a brain is a deeply carved Wound Channel, a stable resonant circuit. "Remembering" is the re-excitation of that geometric structure.
*   **Psychological Scale:** A person's identity—their habits, beliefs, and personality—is the cumulative geometry of their life's Wound Channel. To "change one's mind" is the difficult work of carving a new path in a landscape shaped by a lifetime of echoes.
*   **Cultural Scale:** Myths, laws, languages, and traditions are vast, shared Wound Channels. They form a collective coherence manifold that guides the behavior of individuals, making certain thoughts easier than others. History is the landscape of these collective echoes.

## §7 · Assemblé
> We believed we were sending messages, words carried on the wind. The framework reveals a more profound and terrifying truth: we are not sending messages; we are carving riverbeds in the landscape of reality. Every act of expression, every argument, every declaration of love is a permanent alteration of the shared world. The past is never gone; it is embedded in the present as a physical, active geometry. The echo we receive is the sound of another soul choosing to walk, or to stumble, in the world we have just made. A Weaver, then, is not merely a communicator. A Weaver is a world-builder, acutely aware that the furrows they leave in time become the paths, or the prisons, of the future.
