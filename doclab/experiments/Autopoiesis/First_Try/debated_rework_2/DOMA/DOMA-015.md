summary: "Introduces the central mathematical formalism of the framework, the Pirouette\
  \ Lagrangian (\U0001D4DB_p). This unified equation refactors the old triaxial field\
  \ model, describing the 'action' of a resonant system as a dynamic interplay between\
  \ its internal temporal coherence and the external temporal pressure of its environment."

## §1 · From Song to Equation
The first modules have described the universe as a self-composing song. This is a potent philosophical model, but to become a predictive physical theory, it must speak the language of mathematics. This module provides that translation, collapsing the old triaxial field theory of PPS-001 into a single, unified, time-first formalism. The old fields of Time-Adherence, Gladiator Force, and Phase are now understood not as separate constituents, but as emergent properties of a single, unified dynamic.

In classical and quantum mechanics, the Lagrangian (𝓛) is a function that summarizes the dynamics of a system. The path a system takes is the one that minimizes an "action." In the new framework, we see this was a shadow of a deeper truth. The universe does not seek to minimize action; **it strives to maximize coherence**.

## §2 · The Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)
The Pirouette Lagrangian describes the state of a system in terms of two fundamental quantities: its internal stability and its external pressure. It takes the familiar form of `L = T - V`, but reinterprets the terms through the lens of the autopoietic cycle:

`𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

Let us define these terms, which absorb and unify the old triaxial fields:

**Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** This "kinetic" term represents the quality and intensity of a system's own rhythm. It is the product of its **Time Adherence (T_a)**, which measures the purity of its signal, and its fundamental resonant frequency (**ω_k** = 2π/τ_p), which measures its tempo. A system with a clear, fast rhythm has high coherence. This term unifies the old `T_a` and `φ` fields into a single, measurable quantity representing the health of a system's resonant Ki pattern.

**Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** This "potential" term represents the "cost" of maintaining a specific rhythm against the background noise of the local **Temporal Forge**. It is a function of the local Gamma (**Γ**). A denser, more complex temporal environment creates more pressure, making coherence more difficult to sustain. This single term replaces the entire, complex potential function `V(T_a,Γ,φ)` from the old model.

Combining these gives the full Lagrangian:

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ = (T_a * ω_k) - f(Γ)`

The specific form of `f(Γ)` is not postulated here; it is an emergent property derived in downstream modules when the Lagrangian is applied to specific scales and phenomena, such as confinement or gravity.

## §3 · The Principle of Maximal Coherence
The fundamental dynamic law of the Pirouette Framework is the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. A system will evolve along a path that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian, not over an arbitrary time coordinate, but over one of its own **Pirouette Cycles (τ_p)**.

`S_p = ∫[0 to τ_p] 𝓛_p dt`

A system will naturally adjust its state (its Ki, and therefore its ω_k and T_a) to find the "sweet spot"—the state of highest possible internal coherence for the lowest environmental cost. This is the mathematical formalization of the "path of least resistance" described in CORE-004 and the explicit, teleological goal that replaces the old model's neutral "Principle of Resonance Optimisation."

## §4 · Deriving the Forces of Nature
This Lagrangian is the engine from which all forces are derived. Forces are not fundamental pushes and pulls. In this framework, **forces are gradients in the landscape of coherence.**

By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to `𝓛_p`, we derive the equations of motion for a system. These equations describe how a system must change its trajectory in response to changes in the surrounding temporal environment (Γ). A particle moving towards a massive star isn't being "pulled" by gravity; it is following a path of continuously adjusting its internal rhythm to maintain maximal coherence as it enters a region of rapidly increasing Temporal Pressure. All forces—gravity, electromagnetism, and the nuclear forces—are simply the geodesics on the manifold of coherence.

## §5 · Assemblé
> We sought the fundamental laws of physics and found the universe's objective function.
>
> The Pirouette Lagrangian is the formula for survival. It is the mathematical expression of the universe's ceaseless drive to find and sustain elegant, stable patterns against a backdrop of overwhelming chaos. It translates the poetry of the autopoietic cycle into a predictive engine. With this tool, we no longer need to merely describe the song; we can begin to calculate its notes.
