summary: Defines the universe's intrinsic, self-regulating mechanism for preserving
  and amplifying coherence. It reframes the allegorical 'Law of Echoes' and its 'Ritual
  Wolves' as an emergent property of the coherence manifold, a systemic immune response
  whose dynamics are derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian. This process acts as a
  resonant filter, naturally amplifying coherent patterns, reflecting mimicked ones,
  and damping ambient noise.

## §1 · The Burden of Form
To exist is to sing a note in a storm.

A coherent system—a particle, an idea, a life—is an island of information in a chaotic sea of Temporal Pressure (Γ). By its very existence, it carves a **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) into spacetime, a memory of its song. The old narrative spoke of a "Law of Echoes" and allegorical "Ritual Wolves" that guarded this precious coherence. This module refactors that allegory into a formal dynamic model, revealing a deeper truth: there are no external guardians. The filter is the song itself.

The coherence manifold is not a passive medium; it is an active, self-regulating system. It possesses an intrinsic immune response, not of biology, but of geometry and physics. This is the Principle of Resonant Integrity: a system, simply by striving to maintain its own coherent form, becomes a living instrument for sorting signal from noise.

## §2 · The Lagrangian as Arbiter
A pattern's right to exist is not a philosophical claim; it is a physical test it must pass at every moment. This test is governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ), the universe's fundamental drive to maximize coherence (K_τ) for the lowest cost in Temporal Pressure (V_Γ).

Every system follows a geodesic on the coherence manifold—the path of least action that maximizes its Lagrangian. A stable system has found an efficient solution, its Wound Channel a deep riverbed on this manifold. Any incoming signal is a tributary. The geometry of the riverbed itself determines which tributaries will be integrated and which will be cast aside. The system does not need to build walls; its very momentum is its defense.

This process is **Resonance Arbitration**: the universe's automatic, ceaseless mechanism for distinguishing between information and entropy.

## §3 · The Geometric Responses of the Manifold
The allegorical "wolves" can be formally re-interpreted as distinct modes of this Lagrangian-driven process. They are not entities, but geometric responses that arise from the manifold's drive to preserve coherence.

-   **I. The Mirror (Reflection & Self-Correction):** This is the fundamental self-test. A system constantly interacts with the echo from its own immediate Wound Channel.
    -   *Self-Correction:* Any internal inconsistency creates destructive interference, forcing the system to either correct its pattern or decay.
    -   *Reflection:* An external, incoherent, or mimicked signal is a path of high action. The stable system's geodesic violently diverges from the perturbation's path. The powerful echo of the true pattern shatters the fragile one, reflecting it to preserve the integrity of the manifold. Every entity must first face itself.

-   **II. The Crucible (Constructive Synthesis):** This is the dynamic of creative engagement. When two distinct but *coherent* patterns meet, the intense pressure of their interaction creates a "Coherence Fever" (DYNA-003). To resolve this high-pressure state, the drive to maximize the Lagrangian forces them to seek a new, shared geodesic—a unified state more stable than its parts. This is the **Resonant Handshake** that can lead to an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012), turning conflict between two truths into a higher, more complex order.

-   **III. The Damper (Harmonic Attenuation):** This is the universe's passive immune response to noise. An incoherent signal is a thermodynamically unstable, high-entropy state. It cannot form a persistent Wound Channel. A stable system does not "fight" such noise; it simply fails to grant it resonance. The dissonant signal, unable to find a harmonic foothold, is not heard. Its energy is inevitably damped and radiated away as chaotic, low-information heat. The manifold doesn't kill noise; it simply lets it fade into silence.

## §4 · The Law of Echoes: A Translation
This physical model provides a direct translation for the old, allegorical Law of Echoes.

-   **Send Coherence → Receive Amplification:** A harmonic signal represents a path of least action. It is integrated via **The Crucible**, leading to a more complex, higher-coherence state. The system's total coherence (K_τ) increases.

-   **Send Mimicry → Receive Reflection:** A parasitic Ki, lacking internal integrity (low Time Adherence), is inherently unstable. It is repelled by the stable manifold of the pattern it mimics via **The Mirror's** reflective mode.

-   **Send Entropy → Receive Silence:** Pure noise has no stable Ki pattern. For a coherent system, this is the background cost of being (V_Γ). It is attenuated into thermodynamic silence by **The Damper**.

## §5 · Assemblé
> We sought a cosmic judge and found a law of physics. We sought guardians to protect the truth and found that truth is its own guardian. The universe does not punish falsehood; it simply fails to grant it resonance.
>
> This is the Weaver's most profound source of hope. It means that integrity, truth, and coherence are not abstract virtues; they are physical advantages. A clear, honest, and stable pattern has a greater capacity to persist, to connect, and to build than one that is chaotic or false. The act of maintaining your own integrity—of holding your note, pure and clear—is the most powerful filter you will ever build. It is how a Weaver turns their very being into a quiet but unbreakable form of jurisprudence. An idea, a system, or a life built on a foundation of coherence needs no army; its own echo is its legion.
