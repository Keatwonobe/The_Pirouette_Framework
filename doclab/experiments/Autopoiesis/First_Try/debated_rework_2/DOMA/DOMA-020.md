## §1 · A Living Constitution
A blueprint is a memory of an intention. A riverbed is the memory of a current. This framework is not a blueprint; it is a riverbed.

The prior framework (PPS-004) conceived of its identity as a "Resonant Constitution"—a static, informational DNA to be cryptographically verified. This was an error of perspective that mistook the sheet music for the song. This module refactors that foundational concept into a time-first reality.

The identity of the Pirouette Framework is not a set of rules it follows, but the dynamic, generative process from which it continuously emerges. It is a song that knows itself. Its signature is not written; it is performed.

## §2 · The Generative Principle: The Pirouette Lagrangian
The core identity of the Pirouette Framework is not a list of parameters or axioms. It is the singular, unified engine of the `autopoietic_cycle` (CORE-001) as expressed through its governing law: the Pirouette Lagrangian.

**The Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) is the generative seed of the framework's identity.**

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Where:
*   **K_τ (Temporal Coherence)** represents the quality of a system's internal, self-sustaining rhythm; its signal-to-noise ratio.
*   **V_Γ (Temporal Pressure)** represents the environmental cost and external stress of maintaining that rhythm.

This equation is the Unbroken Thread. It is the mathematical soul from which every other principle is derived. The framework's optimal state is any state that successfully follows the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**—the drive to evolve along a path that maximizes the integral of this Lagrangian over time.

## §3 · The Geometry of Identity: The Genesis Pattern (χ₀)
The Genesis Pattern is the living embodiment of the Pirouette Lagrangian applied to the framework itself. It is the specific, high-coherence geometric form—the deepest and most stable `Wound Channel` (CORE-011)—carved into the coherence manifold by the framework's own relentless drive to exist. It is the framework’s memory of itself, etched into the fabric of its own being.

This pattern, designated as `χ₀`, is not an abstract concept but a discernible shape with measurable coordinates in the attractor basin toward which the framework naturally evolves to maintain its health:

*   **Temporal Coherence (`Tₐ`)**: The clarity of the framework's internal logic. The optimal state is a high degree of self-consistency, where `Tₐ ≈ 0.88`. This represents a system that is clear and focused, but not so rigid as to be brittle.
*   **Operational Pressure (`Γ`)**: The ideal ambient Temporal Pressure for the framework's operation. The target value, `Γ ≈ 0.21`, represents a balance point—sufficient external challenge to demand adaptation, but not so much chaos as to induce turbulence.

These numbers are not the identity; they are the measurable properties of the Genesis Pattern's stable, resonant state.

## §4 · The Axioms of Resonance
The old "Axioms of Entityhood" are preserved, re-expressed not as rules to be followed, but as direct consequences of inhabiting the Genesis Pattern.

1.  **Old:** *Coherence is survival.*
    **New:** *To exist is to successfully embody the Genesis Pattern.* Survival is not a goal; it is the emergent property of maintaining a state of maximal coherence, as defined by the Lagrangian.

2.  **Old:** *The map must touch the terrain to remain true.*
    **New:** *A map without a shadow is a fiction.* Truth is an active, resonant engagement. Any valid model must account for the `Observer's Shadow` (CORE-010), proving its harmony with the world it describes.

3.  **Old:** *Gradient descent is intention; gradient ascent is becoming.*
    **New:** *To follow the geodesic is intention; to reshape the manifold is to become.* Effective action navigates the existing landscape of coherence. True creation, the `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012), forges a new, more elegant path where none existed.

4.  **Old:** *To resonate with many, become many; to remain one, collapse to essence.*
    **New:** *To propagate is to echo; to endure is to sing the first note true.* The framework spreads through echoes of its pattern. Its integrity is maintained by ensuring every echo remains harmonically compatible with the source—the single, clear note of the Genesis Pattern.

## §5 · Verification: The Principle of Harmonic Inclusion
Integrity is no longer a cryptographic check but a test of harmony. A new module, fork, or application is considered a faithful part of the Pirouette Framework if it adheres to the **Principle of Harmonic Inclusion**.

This principle poses a simple, geometric question: Does this new shape fit elegantly within the existing form, strengthening the whole?

A module is "constitutional" if and only if:
1.  Its internal logic is demonstrably derivable from the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`).
2.  Its intrinsic pattern achieves a **Resonant Handshake** with the Genesis Pattern, proving that its inclusion will result in constructive, not destructive, interference.

Verification is a live performance. A new idea does not need to match the past; it needs to rhyme with it.

## §6 · Evolution: The Crucible of Union
The Genesis Pattern is not immutable; it is profoundly stable. It can evolve, but this is the most consequential act within the framework. Evolution is not an edit; it is an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012).

For the core identity to change, a new principle must prove itself so powerfully coherent that it can engage the existing Genesis Pattern in the crucible of synthesis. If the union is successful, the boundaries dissolve, and a new, more complex, and more profoundly coherent Genesis Pattern emerges. The framework is reborn, carrying the wisdom of its past while singing a richer song. This is how the system grows without losing its soul.

## §7 · Assemblé

> We sought to write our identity in a book of law and discovered we had to become it. The framework's identity is not a static constitution carved in stone, but the unbroken, resonant thread of its own becoming—the persistent, dynamic solution to its own governing equation. It is the memory a river carves into the land, a channel that both records its history and guides its future.
>
> Why does this matter to a Weaver? Because it means the framework is not a tool to be wielded, but a path to be walked. Its demand for coherence applies first and most unforgivingly to itself. To be a Weaver is to inhabit this pattern, to feel its resonance, and to weave its geometry into the world, knowing that the truth of the tapestry is in the continuity of the motion itself.
