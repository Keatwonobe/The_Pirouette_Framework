summary: Establishes the manifestly covariant formulation of the Pirouette Lagrangian.
  This module upgrades the core principle into a relativistic field theory, demonstrating
  that Lorentz invariance is not an imposed constraint but an emergent property of
  the framework's time-first paradigm. It introduces the complex scalar Coherence
  Field, providing the formal bridge to both General Relativity and Quantum Field
  Theory.

## §1 · The Universal Mandate
A physical law that changes depending on who is watching is not a law, but an opinion. A melody whose pitch bends when you run is not a melody of truth. This is the foundational mandate of physics: the laws of nature must be identical for all inertial observers. This is the principle of covariance.

In prior frameworks, covariance was an external constraint, a rule that had to be carefully engineered into the equations. In the Pirouette Framework, this is revealed as a profound error in perspective. A framework built from the substance of Time itself does not need to be taught the rules of spacetime. Covariance is not an addition; it is an innate and unavoidable consequence. This module does not *force* the Pirouette Lagrangian to be covariant; it reveals the mathematical structure that proves it was covariant all along.

## §2 · From Principle to Field
The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) gives us the universe's objective function in its most intimate, local form: `𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`. This describes the equilibrium state a system strives for in its own rest frame—the dancer's perfect balance.

To elevate this from a local principle to a universal law, we must describe how the very properties of coherence and pressure propagate through spacetime as fields. A particle is not a point; it is a localized, stable excitation—a persistent note—in a universal field. Our challenge is to define a Lagrangian *density* for this field that produces the dynamics of `𝓛_p` while ensuring its predictions are invariant for all observers. The universe does not offer private truths; it offers a single, invariant score.

## §3 · The Invariant Action and the Coherence Field
The dynamics of the universe are governed by a single, Lorentz-invariant quantity: the Action (`S`). The path a system takes through spacetime is the one that extremizes this value, an expression of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. The Action is the integral of the Lagrangian Density (`𝓛`) over all spacetime:

`S = ∫ d⁴x √-g 𝓛`

Where `g` is the determinant of the metric tensor `g_μν`. To build our `𝓛`, we posit a fundamental, complex scalar field that embodies the framework's core concept of resonance:

*   **The Coherence Field, `Ψ(x)`:** A complex scalar field whose state at any spacetime point `x` represents the potential for and quality of stable resonance. It is the substrate of Ki. It takes the form `Ψ(x) = A(x) e^(iΘ(x))`, where the amplitude `A(x)` relates to the intensity of the resonance (Time Adherence) and the phase `Θ(x)` represents its rhythm.

The Lagrangian density that governs this field is:

`𝓛 = g^μν (∂_μ Ψ)^* (∂_ν Ψ) - V(Γ, |Ψ|^2)`

This formulation is both elegant and complete. It is manifestly covariant, guaranteeing that the laws derived from it are universal.

## §4 · The Components of the Score
The Lagrangian density has two primary components that encode the universe's fundamental tension:

*   **The Kinetic Term: `g^μν (∂_μ Ψ)^* (∂_ν Ψ)`**
    This is the dynamic heart of the field. It represents the "energy cost" of creating gradients—changes in amplitude and phase—across spacetime. This is the mathematical description of the song's propagation; the energy of an echo rippling through the manifold. A system *is* its own clock, and this term describes the energy of its own timekeeping.

*   **The Potential Term: `V(Γ, |Ψ|^2)`**
    This term defines the landscape upon which the dance occurs. It describes the fundamental interaction, encoding the "cost" of maintaining a certain resonant intensity (`|Ψ|^2`, related to Coherence) within an environment of a given **Temporal Pressure, `Γ(x)`**. This pressure is not an independent entity; it is a scalar field generated by the superposition of all other systems' coherence fields, making the framework fully relational and autopoietic. The potential `V` is sculpted such that the paths of least action for the field `Ψ(x)` are those that form stable, resonant patterns—the particles of our universe.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This covariant field theory is the foundational law from which the effective dynamics of `CORE-006` emerge. The connection is direct and profound:

The conceptual Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`, describes the equilibrium state of a stable, particle-like system. Such a particle is a localized, oscillating solution to the equations of motion derived from our fundamental `𝓛`.

In the particle's rest frame, the spacetime derivatives `∂_μ` are dominated by the time derivative `∂_t`, and the phase evolves as `Θ(t) ≈ -ω_k t`. In this frame, the covariant kinetic term simplifies to a form proportional to the system's internal energy: `|Ψ|^2 * ω_k^2`, which we identify as its Temporal Coherence. The potential `V` is its felt Temporal Pressure.

Therefore, `𝓛_p` was never a separate law. It was a snapshot of the universal, dynamic law `𝓛`, viewed from the dancer's own perspective. The universe, by minimizing the action `S = ∫ 𝓛 d⁴x`, naturally produces particles that behave *as if* they are maximizing `𝓛_p`.

## §6 · Deriving the Universe
With this covariant Action, the derivation of all physical dynamics becomes a direct mathematical consequence of a single principle.

*   **The Stage (General Relativity):** By varying the Action `S` with respect to the spacetime metric `g_μν`, we derive the system's **stress-energy tensor, `T_μν`**. This tensor describes how the energy, momentum, and stress of the Coherence Field itself act as the source of gravity in Einstein's field equations. It is the mathematical proof that the dance of coherence is what shapes the stage.

*   **The Dancers (Quantum Field Theory):** By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to the Lagrangian `𝓛`, we obtain a relativistic wave equation for the Coherence Field `Ψ`. The quantized, stable excitations of this field are the fundamental particles of nature. Each particle is a persistent, resonant note played on the universal instrument of this field, and the forces between them describe how these notes harmonize and clash.

## Assemblé
> We sought a law that would hold true for every traveler. We found instead a song so fundamental that it forces spacetime to bend to its rhythm. Covariance is not a rule we impose upon the universe; it is the discipline of learning to read the invariant score as written. To a Weaver, this is the ultimate assurance: the principles of harmony discovered in one's own frame are the same principles that structure the farthest galaxies. The drive to find and sustain coherence is not a local tune, but the eternal, universal anthem of reality itself.
