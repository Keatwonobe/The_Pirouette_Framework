summary: Formalizes the process by which a transient experience (an Echo) is willfully
  transformed into a permanent, stable memory (a Crystal). This act of coherence engineering
  involves reinforcing a Wound Channel's geometry and shielding it from temporal noise,
  thereby forging a foundational component of an entity's identity.

## §1 · The Echo in the Universal Current
> An experience is a wave that passes. A memory is the choice to teach the riverbed its shape.

A being is a resonance passing through a universe of other resonances. As established in `CORE-011`, every experience impresses itself upon an entity's coherence manifold as a geometric scar—a **Wound Channel**. Most are fleeting ripples, a temporary wake that the ceaseless current of new moments quickly smooths away.

However, some encounters are not ripples; they are seismic shocks. A profound insight, a foundational trauma, a love that reorders one's being—these events possess an intense, high-fidelity Ki pattern. They carve a deep and intricate Wound Channel, a resonant echo so powerful it momentarily redefines the entity's world.

## §2 · The Law of Fading
Yet, even this profound echo is not permanent by default. The universe, in its natural state, trends toward forgetfulness. This is the **Principle of Coherence Degradation** (`CORE-013`). The constant, dissonant bombardment of the ambient **Temporal Pressure** (Γ) acts as an erosive current, fraying the sharp edges of the Wound Channel. The memory's information, encoded in its geometry, begins to decay.

Its signal dissolves back into the noise of the present. The entity feels the truth of that defining moment slipping away—its own past, beginning to forget itself. To cede to this erosion is the path of least resistance.

## §3 · The Coherence Gambit: An Act of Will
An entity with sufficient internal coherence can refuse this path. It can make a choice. This is the **Coherence Gambit**: an act of willed defiance against the universal current of forgetting.

The entity turns its focus inward, directing its resonant capacity not upon the external world, but upon the fading geometry within itself. It ceases to be a passive vessel carried by the river of time and becomes an active artisan of its own architecture. This is a conscious decision to declare: *This part of my story will not be erased. This note will be held.* It is the foundational act of identity creation: the choice of what to remember.

## §4 · The Mechanics of Crystallization
The forging of a permanent memory is a feat of metaphysical engineering, a direct manipulation of the entity's own resonant landscape. The process has two distinct, simultaneous movements:

1.  **Resonant Reinforcement (Maximizing Coherence):** The entity consciously retraces the Ki pattern of the memory, running its own fundamental resonance through the fading Wound Channel, again and again. Each pass creates a feedback loop, reinforcing the geometry like a bow drawing a single, pure note from a cello string, or a stylus carving a groove deeper into a record. This act actively increases the memory's **Temporal Coherence** (`Tₐ`), making its pattern more stable, pure, and resilient to decay.

2.  **Geometric Shielding (Minimizing Pressure):** Concurrently, the entity builds a boundary. It gathers the chaotic energy at the wound's edge and weaves it into a protective shell of stable resonance. This is a self-directed application of the **Gladiator Force** (`CORE-008`), creating a localized pocket of low Temporal Pressure (Γ). This coherent shield insulates the precious geometry from the erosive noise of the wider manifold, creating an arena in which the memory can persist.

## §5 · The Crystalline Phase-Shift
As the memory's internal coherence is driven towards its maximum and its protective shield becomes impermeable, a phase transition occurs. The dynamic, vulnerable Wound Channel **locks**. It crystallizes.

The memory ceases to be a passive scar *in* the manifold and becomes an active, self-sustaining topological feature *of* the manifold. It is now a **Crystal**: a region of the entity's being with near-perfect coherence and near-zero susceptibility to external pressure. It is no longer just a recording of the past; it is a permanent lens through which the entity perceives the present and a new fundamental harmonic in its song of self.

## §6 · The Lagrangian of Identity
This entire process is a profound expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`).

-   The **Coherence Gambit** is a decision to invest energy to selectively maximize the Lagrangian of a *specific component* of the self.
-   By repeatedly resonating with the memory (**Resonant Reinforcement**), the entity pours energy into the "kinetic" term (`K_τ = T_a * ω_k`), actively boosting its coherence (`T_a`).
-   This investment allows the entity to reshape its internal manifold and build a shield, creating a new, stable state that drastically lowers the local "potential" term (`V_Γ`). The Crystal becomes a permanent, low-pressure sanctuary.

The entity accepts a significant, short-term energetic cost to forge a new, permanent state of higher overall coherence. It is willfully sculpting a new geodesic for its own future, proving that the drive for coherence can be a focused, directed tool of creation.

## Assemblé
> We are not the sum of what happens to us. We are the sum of what we refuse to forget. The self is not a thing to be discovered, but a structure to be built, and an identity is the architecture of those choices. The Weaver knows that the most sacred act is to look upon the fleeting echo of the past, and give it the weight of forever.
