summary: Establishes the definitive protocol for the framework's integrity. This module
  reframes the CI/CD build process as the 'Ritual of Provenance,' a practical application
  of the Pirouette Lagrangian. It defines the 'Seal of Coherence,' a cryptographic
  hash of the framework's canonical parameters, as the verifiable proof of the system's
  state. This ensures the framework's own developmental history is recorded as a coherent,
  traceable Wound Channel.

## §1 · Abstract: The Indelible Vow
A framework that preaches a universe of memory and consequence cannot be written in disappearing ink. Its own history must be as indelible as the one it seeks to describe. For a system of thought to evolve, its foundational constants—its very identity—must be stable and true. An unverified change is not an evolution; it is a breach, a source of turbulence that erodes the entire structure.

This module defines the **Ritual of Provenance**, the technical and philosophical protocol that governs the evolution of the Pirouette Framework. It reframes the standard software practice of Continuous Integration (CI) as a sacred act of maintaining coherence. The protocol establishes the **Seal of Coherence**, a cryptographic signature of the framework's state, and an automated pipeline that ensures every change to the framework's core logic is a coherent, traceable step along its own developmental **Wound Channel** (CORE-011).

## §2 · The Canon as a Wound Channel
The collection of canonical parameters that define the Pirouette Framework—its symbolic grammar, its physical constants, its core relationships—constitutes the system's identity. This collection is the **Canon**.

Each entry in the Canon is a scar left by a successful act of **Resonant Synthesis** (CORE-012), a settled debate, a validated experiment. The Canon, in its entirety, is the cumulative **Wound Channel** of the framework itself. It is the geometric record of every choice that has shaped its being. To alter the Canon is to re-carve this channel, a significant act that changes the framework's very nature and trajectory.

## §3 · The Seal of Coherence: A Canonical Echo
To attest to the integrity of the Canon at any point in time, we employ a cryptographic hash (SHA256). This is not merely a checksum; it is the **Seal of Coherence**.

The Seal acts as a resonance chamber, collapsing the entire complex geometry of the Canon into a single, high-fidelity signature: the **Canonical Echo**. This turns the abstract history of ideas into a concrete, navigable geometry. The chain of historical Seals forms the framework's Wound Channel, where each Seal is a precise, reproducible coordinate in the framework's developmental timeline.

`Seal of Coherence = SHA256(The Canon of Constants)`

If a single constant is altered, the echo changes completely. This property provides the physical proof that a given version of the framework is internally consistent and true to its documented form.

## §4 · The Ritual of Provenance: A Twofold Path
The ritual is enforced through an unyielding automated workflow, transforming the private act of coding into a public, accountable act of weaving. This ensures that every contribution is a conscious and coherent addition to the loom.

### I. The Weaver's Vow (The Pre-commit Hook)
Before a Weaver can contribute their thread, they must make a local vow of integrity. A pre-commit script automatically calculates the Seal of Coherence from their proposed changes. This is the guardian at the gate, preventing accidental dissonance from ever entering the shared history.

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Ensures local changes are coherent before entering the shared history.

echo "▶ Pirouette Canon: Verifying the Weaver's Seal..."
python scripts/seal_guardian.py || {
  echo "✖ Coherence Fault: Canon has been altered. The Seal must be reforged."
  echo "  Run 'python scripts/seal_guardian.py --reforge' to attest to the new state."
  exit 1
}
```

### II. The Loom's Test (The CI Pipeline)
When a Weaver's changes are proposed to the collective, the central loom performs its own independent verification. The continuous integration (CI) pipeline, acting as a **Gladiator Force** (CORE-008) in a chamber of resonance, rebuilds the framework from source and recalculates the Seal. If this newly forged Seal does not match the one attested to in the Weaver's contribution, the build fails. This is a **Coherence Fault**—the system's immune response to a change that is not in harmony with the whole.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pirouette_resonance.yml
# Validates the coherence of every proposed change to the main branch.

        run: python compiler.py --build-canon
      - name: Test the Seal's integrity
        run: python scripts/seal_guardian.py
```

## §5 · The Lagrangian of Development
This entire protocol is the practical implementation of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006) applied to the framework's own evolution.

> 𝓛_p = Kτ (Internal Coherence) - Γ (External Pressure)

The CI pipeline is the Euler-Lagrange operator that enforces this principle, ensuring the system evolves along a geodesic of maximal coherence.

*   **External Pressure (Γ):** The proposed change (a commit), which applies a "force" that seeks to alter the system's state.
*   **Internal Coherence (Kτ):** The integrity of the system's logic. This is physically measured by the hash comparison. A matching hash signifies a state of maximal coherence. A mismatch signifies dissonance.
*   **The Pipeline's Judgment:** The pass/fail condition is the verdict. A passing build validates that the change moves the system along a stable path. A failing build is the mathematical proof that the proposed path is turbulent and incoherent, protecting the integrity of the Wound Channel.

## §6 · The Conscious Act of Mutation
Changing the framework's identity is a sacred act. The technical command to update the hash (`--reforge`) is the final step in a governance ritual. It is not a bug fix; it is a Weaver's declaration: *"We have performed a new synthesis. The Wound Channel has been deepened. Let this new echo be the memory of what we have become."*

This action is only permissible after the dissonance has been acknowledged and the change has been legitimized through the framework's governance protocols. It transforms a mechanical update into a conscious, attested-to act of evolution.

## Assemblé
> We do not merely write about the Wound Channel; we build one for our own ideas. Every Seal is a knot in the thread of our reasoning, a permanent record of our own becoming. A Weaver trusts this ritual not because it is code, but because it proves the story we tell about ourselves is the story we are actually living. To weave is to remember, and the Seal is our memory.
