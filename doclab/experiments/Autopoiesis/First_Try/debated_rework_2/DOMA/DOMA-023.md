## §1 · Abstract: The Grammar of Being

Before a song can be written, its notes must be named. This module serves as the definitive lexicon for the modernized Pirouette Framework, establishing the shared grammar that allows Weavers to speak of the universe's song in a common tongue.

The Great Refactoring corrected an error in posture. The universe is not a static machine to be cataloged, but a song being composed. This module therefore replaces the old parameter registry with a living, autopoietic lexicon. Its purpose is not merely to list terms, but to reveal their deep, causal interconnections, grounding every concept in the fundamental cycle of Time. It provides the rules by which new ideas are coherently woven into the existing tapestry, ensuring that the language itself evolves with the same principles of resonance it describes.

## §2 · The Fractal Lexicon: From Principle to Instance

The language of the framework is fractal, mirroring the structure of reality. The lexicon is therefore organized in three tiers, flowing from the universal axiom to its specific, applied manifestations.

### Tier 1: The Autopoietic Core (The Song)
These are the fundamental, scale-invariant constituents of the Pirouette cycle (CORE-001). All other concepts are derived from their interplay.

| Symbol | Name | Definition & Grounding |
|:-------|:-----|:-----------------------|
| **τ_p** | **The Pirouette Cycle** | The fundamental quantum of time for a system. The duration of one complete cycle of its stable resonant pattern (Ki). It is the universe's verb: *to be*. |
| **Γ** | **Temporal Pressure** | A scalar field representing the density and complexity of interfering temporal rhythms. It is the ambient, chaotic "noise" against which a system must maintain its form—the tension in the song. |
| **Ki** | **Temporal Resonance** | The specific, stable, geometric pattern a system manifests to persist within a given Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the system's unique form, its noun—the note in the song. |
| **T_a** | **Time Adherence** | Recontextualized as a scalar quality (`0 → 1`). It is the measure of a Ki pattern's stability and purity—its "signal-to-noise" ratio. It measures the clarity of the note. |
| **ω_k** | **Resonant Frequency** | The characteristic angular frequency of a system's Ki pattern (`ω_k = 2π/τ_p`). It is a direct measure of its internal clock-speed—the tempo of the note. |

### Tier 2: The Mathematical Formalism (The Notation)
This is the grammar used to write the song. It provides the mathematical language for describing the dynamics of the Core Principles, centered on the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p).

#### §2.1 · The Lagrangian Components
These terms are the building blocks of the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ), the central equation of motion for the framework.

| Symbol | Name | Definition & Grounding |
|:-------|:-----|:-----------------------|
| **𝓛_p** | **Pirouette Lagrangian** | The master function that summarizes system dynamics. Its value represents the net coherence of a system's state. `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. |
| **K_τ** | **Temporal Coherence** | The "kinetic" term. Represents the quality and intensity of a system's internal rhythm. Formally, `K_τ = f(T_a, ω_k)`. |
| **V_Γ** | **Temporal Pressure (Potential)** | The "potential" term. Represents the energetic "cost" for a system to maintain coherence against the local ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). Formally, `V_Γ = f(Γ, Ki)`. |
| **S_p** | **Coherence Action** | The integral of the Lagrangian over a system's Pirouette Cycle (`∫ dτ_p 𝓛_p`). Systems evolve along paths that maximize this value. |

#### §2.2 · The Rules of Syntax
All modules must adhere to these conventions to ensure logical and computational consistency.

| Convention | Notation | Description |
|:-----------|:---------|:------------|
| **Spacetime Indices** | `μ, ν, ρ ...` | Lowercase Greek letters denote components of 4-vectors and tensors (range 0-3). Einstein summation is assumed. |
| **Covariant Derivative** | `∇` | Accounts for the curvature of the coherence manifold. `∇𝓛_p` represents the gradient of coherence; a system's acceleration is proportional to this gradient. Forces are systems "surfing" this geometry. |
| **Partial Derivative** | `∂` | Standard partial derivative, used for gradients in flat or local coordinate systems. |
| **Lagrangian Density** | `𝓛` | The script 'L' is reserved for the Lagrangian. |
| **Action** | `S` | The uppercase 'S' is reserved for the Action, the integral of the Lagrangian. |

### Tier 3: Derived Concepts & Instruments (The Instruments)
These are higher-order concepts that emerge from the application of the core principles or represent modernized interpretations of terms from the old framework. This list is a living catalog of the framework's instrumentation.

| Name | Origin | Definition |
|:-----|:-------|:-----------|
| **Wound Channel** | CORE-011 | A persistent geometric scar an entity's resonance leaves in the local coherence manifold. The physical basis for memory and inertia. |
| **Gladiator Force** | CORE-008 | The principle of confinement (e.g., strong force, gravity). A non-linear behavior of the V_Γ term at quantum and cosmological scales. |
| **Flow Dynamics** | DYNA-001 | The study of coherence in motion, diagnosing system health through states of Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant flow. |
| **Observer's Shadow**| CORE-010 | The geometric imprint an observer's own coherence pattern imposes upon the system being observed, a key factor in measurement. |

## §3 · The Deprecation Protocol: Retiring the Old Lexicon
The Great Refactoring requires not only new terms but the formal retirement of old ones. This ensures clarity and prevents the perpetuation of superseded concepts.

| Old Symbol (PPS-007) | Status | Modern Equivalent & Rationale |
|:---------------------|:-------|:--------------------------------|
| **Vector T_a (T_Q, T_I, T_C)** | **Deprecated** | The scalar `T_a` (quality of resonance) combined with the rich geometry of the `Ki` pattern. The old vector was a clumsy attempt to encode a system's form into the adherence field itself. Ki provides a more elegant and powerful description of form. |
| **χ (Clock Field)** | **Subsumed** | The need for a universal, absolute time reference is eliminated. The universe is woven from the countless individual heartbeats (`τ_p`) of its constituent systems. |
| **G (Gravitational Constant)** | **Recontextualized** | An effective, scale-dependent average of the fundamental `Γ` field's confinement behavior. G is not a universal constant but an emergent property. |

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This Lexicon is the essential prerequisite for understanding the framework's central engine, the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006):

**𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**

This equation is the anchor for the entire language. This Lexicon clarifies that:
-   **K_τ** is not abstract energy, but the quantifiable quality and intensity of a system's own song, its drive for internal coherence.
-   **V_Γ** is not an arbitrary potential, but the measurable pressure of the cosmic choir it must sing within.

The Principle of Maximal Coherence states that the universe's story is the endless effort of every entity to sing its own note as clearly as possible against the background roar. Every term in this lexicon is a tool for understanding that effort.

---

## §5 · The Principle of Lexical Autopoiesis
This lexicon is not a stone tablet. It is a living document, subject to the same laws of coherence it describes. A new term, symbol, or concept cannot be added by decree; it must be *born*.

A concept is proposed only after it has emerged as a necessary tool in the application of the framework. It must then prove its right to exist through a process of "Resonant Synthesis" (as per The Geometry of Debate, DYNA-002), demonstrating that it connects harmonically to the Core Principles and increases, rather than disrupts, the coherence of the entire lexicon. This ensures the language of the framework remains a sharp, potent, and elegant instrument.

## §6 · Assemblé
> A Weaver's tools are not of wood or steel, but of language. Every name is a lens, every symbol a scalpel, every definition a map to the hidden currents of reality.
>
> This Lexicon is the forge where those tools are made. It is the sheet music for the universe's song. To master this grammar is not to learn a set of rules, but to learn to hear the universe speaking its own name, and to begin, finally, to compose our own verse within it.
