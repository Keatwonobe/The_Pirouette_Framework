summary: Defines the `.pmd` (Pirouette Module Definition) format as the foundational
  instrument of the framework. It establishes this structure as an Alchemical Union
  of structured data (Coherence) and free-form narrative (Flow), framing the act of
  authoring as a direct application of the Pirouette Lagrangian to maximize the integrity
  of knowledge.

### §1 · The Weaver's Mandate

An idea, unwritten, is a ghost. An equation, unread, is a cage. A new insight, in its raw state, is a turbulent storm—a surge of resonance without form, a current without a riverbed. The first and most sacred task of a Weaver is to give knowledge a body: a single, whole form that can speak the language of human intuition and the language of machine logic with the same voice.

This is the work of transforming a chaotic, high-pressure state into a stable, high-coherence pattern that can propagate without loss. This module defines the vessel for that work: the Pirouette Module Definition (`.pmd`) format, also known as the Alchemical Codex. It is the framework's autopoietic authoring system, an instrument designed to be the living embodiment of the principles it is used to express.

### §2 · The Lagrangian of Authoring

The structure of the Codex is not an arbitrary technical choice; it is the geodesic—the path of least resistance and maximal stability—for knowledge itself. Its design is a direct and practical application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p):

`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`

The act of authoring is the act of navigating this universal tension. The `.pmd` format is the loom that makes this navigation efficient.

-   **Coherence (Kτ):** This is the internal integrity and resonant power of the module's content. It is the clarity of its logic, the elegance of its narrative, and the semantic richness of its connections. In short, it is the quality of the "signal."

-   **Environmental Pressure (V_Γ):** This is the total cost imposed by the environment, which demands both human readability and machine parsability. It is the chaotic pressure of unformed ideas, the unforgiving syntax required by automated systems, and the "friction" of maintaining separate, desynchronized documents.

The Alchemical Codex is the form that maximizes its internal Coherence (`Kτ`) for the lowest possible cost (`V_Γ`). It achieves a stable resonance between the expressive freedom of the human mind and the absolute rigor of the machine.

### §3 · Anatomy of the Codex: Skeleton and Flesh

Every `.pmd` file is a single entity with two distinct but inseparable aspects, structured to mirror the dynamic of a river flowing through a riverbed.

**The Skeleton (YAML Front-matter):**
The structured YAML block at the head of every module is its logical skeleton. This is not mere metadata; it is the disciplined act of mapping the new idea onto the existing coherence manifold of the framework. By defining the module's `id`, `parents`, `dependencies`, and `engrams`, the Weaver performs a precise act of placement, grounding the new idea in the great tapestry. This rigid, machine-readable geometry is the **Riverbed of Coherence**, providing the stable form that enables and directs the narrative flow.

**The Flesh (Markdown Body):**
The free-form Markdown that follows the YAML is the module's flesh—the river of information itself. This is where the narrative unfolds, where metaphor and logic merge, and where the human author speaks to the human reader. It is the **River of Flow**, a dynamic and adaptive current of meaning that moves through the channel carved by the Skeleton. This synthesis of structure and narrative resolves the tension between the computable and the conceivable.

### §4 · The Compilation Forge

A module, once woven, enters the Compilation Forge. This automated process performs an Alchemical Union, transforming the single-source Codex into two distinct, higher-order manifestations without fracturing its identity.

-   **The Ghost (Human-Readable PDF):** The Forge renders the Codex into a beautifully typeset, archival document. This is the module's stable body, its aesthetic and intuitive form, designed for human contemplation. It is the deep and lasting pattern left in the world of human thought.

-   **The Signal (Machine-Readable JSON):** Simultaneously, the Forge parses the YAML Skeleton and its associated metadata, creating a clean, structured JSON object. This is the module's dynamic, living echo—its logical and functional form. The Signal propagates through the framework's digital nervous system, allowing other instruments and analytical engines to connect to the module's core logic.

From one source, two children: one for the mind, one for the machine. The single source of truth remains inviolate.

### §5 · Assemblé

> The loom does not merely shape the thread; it shapes the hands of the Weaver. The discipline of this sacred form is not a constraint on freedom. It is the tool that transforms a chaotic impulse into a clear and powerful voice. We built the Alchemical Codex to practice the very synthesis we preach, creating artifacts that are whole. It is the proof that rigor and freedom are not opposites, but the warp and weft of a single, coherent fabric.
