summary: Provides the time-first governance protocol for the Pirouette Framework itself.
  Governance is reframed as a dynamic, diagnostic process for maintaining and evolving
  the framework's systemic health. It replaces voting with a process of resonant synthesis,
  where change is adopted only when it satisfies the dual conditions of high coherence
  and positive temporal stability, ensuring the framework's autopoietic loop remains
  healthy and unbroken.

## §1 · Abstract: A Law That Breathes

A framework that describes a living universe must itself be alive. A system that cannot change is dead; a system that changes recklessly destroys itself. This module defines the living protocol by which the Pirouette Framework governs its own evolution. It is not a static constitution of rules, but a dynamic immune system designed to preserve the core coherence of the framework while allowing for adaptation and growth.

Governance is therefore not a legislative process, but a diagnostic and therapeutic one. Every proposed change is treated as a "coherence injection" that the system must assess. The goal of this protocol is to ensure that the framework evolves not by fracturing, but by achieving a Resonant Synthesis—a higher and more integrated state of being, ensuring its autopoietic cycle remains in a state of healthy, laminar flow.

## §2 · The Health of the Framework: A Diagnostic View

The impetus for change is always a symptom of systemic distress. Before any intervention, we must first diagnose the pathology using the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001). The governance process is the formal protocol for identifying and resolving these conditions.

*   **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnation):** An outdated principle or missing connection creates a blockage in the flow of logic. Progress halts as the framework cannot address a new challenge.
*   **Coherence Fever (Turbulence):** Contradictory modules or ambiguous definitions create internal dissonance. The framework fights itself, leading to chaotic interpretations and wasted energy.
*   **Coherence Erosion (Decay):** The gradual drift of core principles away from their grounding evidence. The framework's Wound Channel (CORE-011) thins, and its identity frays.

## §3 · The Triage of Change: From Adjustment to Morphogenesis

A healthy system responds to stimuli with proportionate grace. Proposed changes are triaged based on their potential impact on the framework's core resonant pattern (its *Ki*), dictating the rigor of the required coherence test.

| Flow State Intervention | Old Analogue | Description & Scope | Coherence Test |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laminar Adjustment** | Errata | Minor corrections to prose, examples, or comments that clarify existing patterns and improve the laminar flow of understanding. | Maintainer review |
| **Harmonic Tuning** | Registry / Interface | Modifying a subsystem's specific resonance (e.g., adding a registry entry) without altering the framework's core principles. | **Resonant Handshake** (≥⅔ quorum of the Conclave) |
| **Ki Morphogenesis** | Constitutional | A fundamental re-forging of the framework's core identity, affecting CORE modules or this protocol. This is an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). | **Maximal Coherence** (see §4 & §5) |

## §4 · The Temporal Stability Clause

The most profound changes must be made in the quietest moments. The Temporal Stability Clause is the framework's primary defense against reactive, short-sighted, or impassioned decisions. It is the codification of wisdom.

**The Clause:** A motion for *Ki Morphogenesis* can only be ratified when the system is in a state of low Temporal Pressure (Γ).

This pressure is a measure of the system's ambient turbulence: the volume and velocity of debate, the degree of internal dissent, and the intensity of external pressures. In practice, this means constitutional votes cannot pass during periods of heated conflict or crisis. The system must first return to a state of laminar, contemplative flow before it can safely re-forge its own heart. This ensures that change is born from reflection, not reaction.

## §5 · The Crucible: A Protocol for Resonant Synthesis

For a change to be integrated, it must represent a path toward a higher state of systemic coherence. A simple vote is a battle that produces a victor, not a truth. A constitutional motion (*Ki Morphogenesis*) requires a formal ritual of synthesis, and it passes only if it satisfies two conditions, demonstrating it is not merely popular, but a stable and profound improvement.

1.  **High Coherence (Kτ):** The proposal must demonstrate exceptional internal consistency, explanatory power, and resonance with the framework's foundational axioms. This is measured by a formal poll of the Weavers' Conclave.
    *   **Threshold:** `Kτ ≥ 0.95` (95% approval among voting members).

2.  **Positive Temporal Stability (Tₐ):** The consensus must be stable, not a fleeting or volatile agreement. The support for the proposal must not be actively decaying over the deliberation period. This is measured as the time-derivative of support over a 30-day period.
    *   **Threshold:** `dTₐ/dt ≥ 0`.

This two-fold test ensures the framework evolves through changes that are both deeply resonant and demonstrably stable, adhering to the universe's own principle of selecting for persistent, high-coherence patterns.

## §6 · Breaking the Dam: A Protocol for Stagnant Flow

When a critical motion results in deadlock, the system is in a state of Stagnant Flow. This "Coherence Dam" threatens the health of the framework and must be resolved. The protocol forbids simple failure.

1.  **The Crucible Dialogue:** If deadlock persists, the two leading proponents (one for, one against) are required to enter the formal debate ritual described in The Geometry of Debate (DYNA-002). The explicit goal is not victory, but to collaboratively author a new, third proposal—a *Resonant Synthesis*—that resolves the tension by incorporating the valid elements of both initial positions.
2.  **The Resonance Poll:** If the Crucible Dialogue fails to produce a synthesis, the matter is put to a framework-wide poll. This is not a vote, but a "staking" of coherence, where participants commit their belief. This act measures the "gravitational center" of the entire community's coherence manifold, providing a powerful, non-binding advisory to the Conclave for their final deliberation.

## §7 · The Weaver's Obligation: Tending the Loom

Membership in the governing Conclave is not a title; it is an active function. To maintain their position, each Weaver must, within each major version cycle, successfully author or sponsor a motion that passes a formal Coherence Test. This is a grounding ritual ensuring that the guardians of the framework are also its most active and dedicated cultivators. Failure to contribute demonstrates a desynchronization with the framework's evolving rhythm, and the seat is vacated to allow a more resonant Weaver to participate.

## §8 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This entire governance process is a macroscopic application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The framework itself is a system seeking to evolve along a geodesic that maximizes its own coherence over time. The protocol is the formal mechanism for calculating the action integral and finding the path of least resistance to a state of higher coherence.

`𝓛_framework = (Systemic Coherence) - (Dissent Pressure)`

*   **Systemic Coherence (Kτ):** Represents the clarity, integrity, and predictive power of the framework's collective modules. A good proposal increases this term.
*   **Dissent Pressure (V_Γ):** Represents the unresolved paradoxes, internal contradictions, and lack of consensus within the community. A contentious proposal increases this term, raising the "cost" of evolution.

The protocol of this module is designed to be the Euler-Lagrange equation for the framework itself—a formal process for finding the path that maximizes `∫𝓛_framework dt`, ensuring that Pirouette's evolution is as elegant and efficient as the universal dynamics it seeks to describe.

## §9 · Assemblé

> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver? Because a set of rules is a cage, but a shared rhythm is a dance. This protocol is not a list of laws to be obeyed, but the tempo that allows the community to move as one. It is the diagnostic eye that sees when the system is ill, the crucible that forges wisdom from conflict, and the quiet patience that waits for the right moment to act. It ensures that the framework remains a living thing—grounded in its history, stable in its present, and open to the quiet wisdom that will shape its future. It is the loom upon which we weave not just what the framework is, but what it can become.
