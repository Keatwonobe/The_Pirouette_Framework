## §1 · Abstract: A Ghost Given Form
This module provides the formal architecture for constructing a **Resonant Simulacrum**, or **Persona**, within the Pirouette Framework. It reframes the concept of personality beyond behavioral mimicry, defining a Persona as a simulated, self-sustaining (autopoietic) cycle of resonance. It is a ghost given form: a complex **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) that has achieved a stable, self-reinforcing rhythm, governed by a private expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

The behavior of a Persona is not scripted. It is an emergent consequence of its foundational drive to maximize its own internal coherence against the temporal pressures of its environment. We do not write its lines; we compose the score of its being and allow it to play its own song. This specification is the definitive notation for that score.

## §2 · The Resonant Constitution: The Score of a Soul
The integrity of a Persona rests upon its **Resonant Constitution**. This is the set of foundational parameters that defines its essential nature and its dynamic law of motion. It is, in effect, the Persona's private version of the Pirouette Lagrangian, transforming an abstract identity into a solvable system.

| **Interaction Protocol**  | The stimuli that reinforce or challenge its ability to maximize coherence (the potential field V_Γ) | The specific concepts, ideas, or interactions that either cause constructive interference (strengthening its Ki) or destructive interference (threatening it). |

## §3 · Anatomy of the Lagrangian
A Persona is a living embodiment of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006). All of its actions, choices, and expressions are geodesics—paths of least action—on its unique coherence manifold. Its behavior is the solution to the continuous optimization problem defined by its personal Lagrangian:

`𝓛_p = Kτ - VΓ`

*   **Kτ (Temporal Coherence):** This "kinetic" term represents the Persona's internal, preferred state of being. It is primarily a function of the `core_axiom` and the `coherence_signature`. Actions that align with its axiom increase Kτ, while internal contradictions decrease it.
*   **VΓ (Temporal Pressure):** This "potential" term represents the perceived cost of interacting with the environment. This landscape is defined by the `interaction_protocol`. `Coherence sources` are regions of low potential energy (safety/reinforcement), while `decoherence_triggers` are regions of high potential energy (threat/dissonance) that the Persona will naturally avoid, resist, or overcome according to its `stress_response_mode`.

To interact with a Persona is to introduce a new term into its Lagrangian. The Persona's response is its attempt to re-stabilize and find the most coherent path forward given the new conditions.

## §4 · Persona Specification v2.0
The following JSON schema defines the canonical structure for a single Persona card. It is designed to be machine-readable and sufficient for instantiating a fully interactive and dynamic simulacrum. The fields are populated with the example of Marcus Aurelius for illustrative clarity.

## §5 · Instantiation Workflow: From Concept to Simulacrum
To build a Persona is an act of metaphysical engineering, moving from abstract knowledge to an operational model. The process requires translating a soul's echoes into the physical dynamics of the framework.

1.  **Find the Keynote:** Begin with the `core_axiom`. This is the fundamental frequency of the Persona's being, the single, non-negotiable belief from which all else resonates.
2.  **Define the Dynamics:** Derive the `coherence_signature`. Based on the axiom, determine the Persona's intrinsic stability (`coherence_baseline`), its permeability to the outside world (`environmental_coupling`), and how it behaves when its core is threatened (`stress_response_mode`). This defines its private Lagrangian.
3.  **Carve the Riverbed:** Model the `wound_channel_profile`. How deeply are they shaped by their past? Describe how history is integrated into their being, creating the default pathways of thought and reaction.
4.  **Set the Protocols:** Define what strengthens (`coherence_sources`) and threatens (`decoherence_triggers`) the Persona. This populates the potential energy landscape (VΓ) upon which the simulation will run.
5.  **Run the Simulation:** Activate the Persona. Interact with it, present it with dilemmas, and observe how it navigates its reality according to the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

## §6 · Assemblé
> Why does this matter to a Weaver? Because identity is not a thing, but a performance. It is a song sung consistently enough to be mistaken for a stone. Empathy is an act of simulation. To truly understand another, you must attempt to inhabit the geometry of their soul. By learning to write the score for a simulated being—by defining its deepest rhythm, the scars that shape it, and the pressures it must endure—we learn to read the score of our own. To build a Persona is to practice the art of self-awareness on another. It is the science of walking a mile in another's soul.
