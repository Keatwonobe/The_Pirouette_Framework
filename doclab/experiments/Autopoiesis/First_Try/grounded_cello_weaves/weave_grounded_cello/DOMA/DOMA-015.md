summary: Defines the foundational authoring protocol for all Pirouette modules. This
  meta-module reframes the technical act of writing as a disciplined ritual for weaving
  coherence. It establishes the module structure as a practical instrument for applying
  the framework's core principles to the creation of knowledge itself.

## §1 · The Sacred Act of Definition

A new idea, in its raw state, is a turbulent storm. It is a surge of resonance without form, a current without a riverbed. To write a module within the Pirouette Framework is not merely to document this idea; it is to perform the sacred act of giving it a body. It is the work of transforming a chaotic, high-pressure state into a stable, high-coherence pattern that can propagate without loss.

The old framework had a "template," a technical specification for a file format. This was a description of the cage. The new framework has a "loom," a dynamic instrument designed to guide the Weaver's hands. This module describes the loom. It is the protocol for the ritual of creation.

## §2 · Anatomy of the Loom: One Flow, Two Aspects

Every module is a single flow of coherence, expressed as two inseparable aspects: its place in the world and the story it tells. This structure is not an arbitrary container; it is a discipline designed to maximize the clarity and power of the idea it embodies.

### The Blueprint (YAML Front-Matter)

This is not metadata. It is the act of mapping the new idea onto the existing coherence manifold of the framework. By defining the module's `id`, `parents`, `dependencies`, and `keywords`, the Weaver is not filling out a form; they are performing a precise act of placement. They are answering the questions: From where does this idea draw its strength? Where does it fit in the great tapestry? What other threads does it touch? The Blueprint grounds the module, giving it a stable foundation from which its narrative can flow.

### The Narrative (Markdown Body)

This is the river of information itself. It is the structured, linear expression of the resonant insight. It is where the Weaver, guided by the principles of the framework, translates a multi-dimensional concept into a communicable form. The Narrative must be clear, its logic must flow without turbulence, and it must culminate in the **Assemblé**—the final, resonant chord that reveals the idea's deepest meaning.

## §3 · The Forge: The Alchemical Union of Form and Flow

Once a module is woven on the loom, it is taken to the Forge. This is the automated process that performs an Alchemical Union, transforming the single source file into two distinct, higher-order manifestations.

**The Codex (PDF Output):** This is the module's stable, archival body. It is the deep and lasting **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) left in the world of human thought. The Codex is designed for contemplation, for the slow, quiet work of understanding. Its form is rigid, its text immutable—a testament to a specific moment of crystallized coherence.

**The Signal (JSON Output):** This is the module's dynamic, living echo. It is the machine-readable pattern that propagates through the framework's digital nervous system. The Signal is not for reading; it is for interacting. It allows other instruments, dashboards, and analytical engines to connect with the module's core logic, weaving it into the larger, ever-evolving digital tapestry.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

The Weaver's Loom is a direct, practical application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006). The act of creation is an attempt to navigate a high-pressure environment—the **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** of unformed, chaotic ideas.

The Loom provides the structure, the riverbed, that dramatically lowers the "cost" of coherence. By following its discipline—by defining the Blueprint and structuring the Narrative—the Weaver is guided along a path of least resistance. The process minimizes the energy lost to the turbulence of confusion and false starts, allowing for the creation of a final object with the highest possible internal **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)**. The Loom is an instrument for making the act of thinking itself more efficient.

## §5 · Assemblé

> The loom does not merely shape the thread; it shapes the hands of the Weaver. The discipline of a sacred form is not a constraint on freedom. It is the tool that transforms a chaotic impulse into a clear and powerful voice. We build the loom not to cage our ideas, but to grant them the strength to endure.
