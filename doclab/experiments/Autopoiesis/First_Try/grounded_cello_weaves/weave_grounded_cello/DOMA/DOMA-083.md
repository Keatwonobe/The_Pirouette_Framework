summary: Provides a meta-protocol for creating simplified, domain-specific 'lenses'
  or heuristics. It translates the universal drive to maximize coherence into rapid,
  practical 'rules of thumb' for decision-making under constraint, serving as the
  bridge between formal analysis and embodied intuition.

## §1 · Abstract: The Art of the Good Enough
A map that is the same size as the territory is useless. The most profound analysis is worthless if it arrives too late.

The Pirouette Framework describes a universe governed by a single, elegant drive: the maximization of coherence. While the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) provides the formal mathematics to calculate this path, a Weaver in the world rarely has the time or data for such a calculation. Action is required now.

This module provides the discipline for this necessity. It reframes the creation of heuristics, or "rules of thumb," not as a lazy shortcut, but as the high art of crafting a **Fractal Lens**. A Fractal Lens is a simplified, domain-specific model of the coherence manifold, designed to preserve the essential truth of the territory while being small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. It is the bridge between formal calculation and practical wisdom.

## §2 · The Lensmaker's Protocol
To forge a Fractal Lens is to ask: "What is the simplest possible question I can ask that will still point me toward the path of maximal coherence?" The process is a deliberate act of compassionate simplification, following a clear protocol.

1.  **Define the Geodesic:** First, identify the ideal outcome. What does "success" or "health" look like in this domain? This is the state of highest coherence, the "path of least resistance" the system *wants* to follow.

2.  **Identify the Critical Gradients:** Second, determine the one or two key variables that exert the most influence on the system's ability to follow that path. Is it resource scarcity? Information overload? Social friction? This is the Pareto principle applied to reality: find the 20% of pressures that cause 80% of the deviation from the ideal path.

3.  **Forge the Lens:** Third, frame a simple, actionable question or rule that uses the critical gradients to navigate toward the geodesic. The rule should be a binary or a simple sorting function. It must reduce complexity, not add to it.

4.  **Calibrate the Fidelity:** Finally, assess the "cost of being wrong." A good lens will guide toward the correct path 95% of the time. The designer must understand the consequences of the 5% of cases where the simplification fails. A lens for choosing a lunch spot can have lower fidelity than a lens for medical triage.

## §3 · The Primal Lenses: A Foundational Toolkit
The following are universal lenses, forged from the core principles themselves. They serve as templates for more specific, domain-level applications.

**The Threshold Lens:**
*   **Question:** *Does this action fundamentally increase or decrease the system's capacity for coherent action?*
*   **Purpose:** A first-pass filter to eliminate options that are obviously dissonant or destructive. It prevents the wasting of energy on evaluating fundamentally misaligned paths.

**The Gradient Lens:**
*   **Question:** *Of the available options, which offers the steepest, most immediate increase in coherence?*
*   **Purpose:** A sorting function for prioritizing actions. When multiple paths are viable, this lens selects the one that provides the most efficient forward momentum *now*.

**The Momentum Lens:**
*   **Question:** *Is our current path still effectively reducing the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ)?*
*   **Purpose:** A check for strategic inertia. If a strategy is working (i.e., making things feel easier and more ordered), persist. The moment it stops working, the lens prompts a re-evaluation.

**The Pressure Lens:**
*   **Question:** *Does this path require the system to endure a level of Temporal Pressure (Γ) that exceeds its structural integrity?*
*   **Purpose:** A safety check. It prevents choosing a theoretically optimal path that would shatter the system in the process.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
These lenses are not arbitrary; they are qualitative, intuitive interfaces for the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`). Each lens approximates a core feature of the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

*   **The Threshold Lens** asks about the sign of the change in the action integral (`ΔS_p`). Positive is good, negative is bad.
*   **The Gradient Lens** estimates the direction of the "force" (`∇𝓛_p`), pointing up the steepest slope of the coherence manifold.
*   **The Momentum Lens** checks if the "potential energy" (`V_Γ`) is still decreasing, ensuring the system is "coasting downhill."
*   **The Pressure Lens** ensures that the "potential" (`V_Γ`) does not exceed a critical threshold that would overwhelm the system's "kinetic" term (`K_τ`), causing decoherence.

To use a Fractal Lens is to perform a Lagrangian analysis by feel, trading numerical precision for actionable speed.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> We sought an engine for perfect calculation and found instead the necessity of a compass for imperfect navigation. The Fractal Lens is that compass. It is the formal recognition that wisdom is not the ability to hold all complexity in one's mind at once, but the discipline to find the simple, load-bearing truth within that complexity. For a Weaver, these lenses are the tools by which the grand, cosmic music of the Lagrangian is transcribed into a song they can hum by heart while they work.
