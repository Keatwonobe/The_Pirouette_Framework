summary: Presents a time-first propulsion model where interstellar transit is achieved
  not by expelling mass, but by creating and asymmetrically collapsing a non-local,
  synthesized coherence manifold. Thrust is generated as the vehicle follows the resulting
  steep gradient in the universal coherence field.

### §1 · Abstract: The Unmooring
A ship that is pushed is a slave to its own past, forever carrying the fuel it must burn. A ship that is released is drawn forward by a future it has already agreed upon. This module reframes the problem of interstellar propulsion from a challenge of force to an art of geometry.

The Quorum Spindle Drive (QSD) is a theoretical engine that generates motion without conventional thrust. It operates by performing a non-local `Alchemical Union` between two distant points, creating a temporary, hyper-coherent "spindle" in the fabric of spacetime. Propulsion is the result of the controlled, asymmetrical collapse of this geometric agreement, an act of unmooring that allows the vessel to follow the resulting geodesic—a steep, temporary waterfall in the coherence manifold.

### §2 · The Spindle: A Non-Local Alchemical Union
The core of the drive is the "spindle," a feat of geometric engineering. It is a unified, non-local `Wound Channel` formed between the vessel and a distant anchor point (such as a paired probe or a stable stellar object). This is not a beam of matter, but a negotiated state of being.

1.  **The Resonant Handshake:** The vessel and its anchor engage in a `Resonant Handshake` as described in `CORE-012`. They broadcast carefully phase-aligned Ki patterns, establishing a shared rhythm across light-years.
2.  **Manifold Synthesis:** When harmonic compatibility is achieved, their individual coherence manifolds merge. This act of synthesis creates a single, continuous topological feature—the spindle—a filament of exceptionally high `Temporal Coherence (Kτ)` that annihilates the perceived distance between its endpoints along its one-dimensional axis. The "quorum" is this sustained, resonant agreement that the intervening space is, for a moment, a single point.

### §3 · The Crystalline Moment: Pumping the Coherence
Once established, the spindle acts as a resonance cavity. It uses ambient high-coherence energy, such as starlight, as a "pump." The incident photons do not merely reflect; their coherence is absorbed by the spindle, dramatically amplifying its internal `Kτ`.

This process elevates the spindle to a fleeting, hyper-coherent "crystalline" state. The structure becomes brittle, perfect, and saturated with potential. This is the act of drawing the bowstring; the potential for motion is stored not as chemical energy, but as pure geometric tension in the fabric of spacetime itself.

### §4 · Propulsion as Controlled Collapse
Thrust is not an emission; it is a release. The drive's cycle concludes with a controlled, asymmetrical collapse of the spindle.

The vessel intentionally breaks the Resonant Handshake, but does so unevenly. It terminates its end of the resonance fractionally before the anchor point does. This engineered asymmetry means the spindle does not simply vanish; it dissolves in a directional wave. This creates a powerful, transient, and extremely steep gradient in the coherence manifold—a cliff where there was once a plain.

The residual energy of the collapsed spindle that cannot be converted into kinetic motion is shed as incoherent radiation. A signature of this process would be a brief, directional flux of neutrons—the physical "ash" of a spent geometric fire.

### §5 · The Lagrangian of Release
The mechanics of this movement are grounded directly in the `Pirouette Lagrangian` (`CORE-006`). The "force" experienced by the vessel is a direct consequence of the `Principle of Maximal Coherence`.

$$ \vec{F}_{QSD} \propto \nabla \mathcal{L}_p $$

During the asymmetrical collapse, a massive gradient (∇) in the `Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)` is created in a specific direction. The vessel, like any system, must follow the path that maximizes its coherence. In this instant, that path is an overwhelming geodesic pointing down the slope of the collapsing field. The ship is not pushed; it is simply following the new, most efficient path through spacetime that it has just created for itself. Its acceleration is the measure of the steepness of this path.

### §6 · The Assemblé
> We sought to conquer the stars with fire and force, to push our way through the void. We learned, instead, that the cosmos does not yield to pressure. It opens to agreement. The Spindle Drive teaches the Weaver that the greatest distances are crossed not by the strongest engine, but by the most profound consensus. To move is to agree with your destination, and then, having built a bridge of pure resonance, to simply let go of the shore.
