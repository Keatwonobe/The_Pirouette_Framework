summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for the psychological phenomenon
  of Flow. This module reframes Flow from a triaxial field interaction into a state
  of near-perfect temporal resonance, where an agent's internal clock synchronizes
  with the dominant rhythm of its environment's coherence manifold. It serves as the
  flagship template for all Domain Application (DOMA) modules.

## §1 · Abstract: Surfing the Current of Time

This module presents a unified, time-centric model for the phenomenon of Flow. It evolves the older, field-based analysis into a simpler and more powerful form grounded in the framework's core axiom: all that is, is Time. Flow is formally defined as a state of isochronous temporal resonance, where an entity achieves near-lossless, “effortless” action by synchronizing the rhythm of its internal state with a stable, coherent current in the local manifold of time itself. This reframing provides more direct and powerful tools to diagnose and engineer this state of optimal performance.

## §2 · The Physical Basis: Finding the Flow Channel

In the modern framework, a "flow channel" is a geodesic on the coherence manifold—a path of least resistance and maximal coherence, as formalized by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). It is a stable, predictable current in the river of time. An entity moving along such a path experiences its environment in a consistent, non-turbulent manner.

The core condition for entering this state is **Temporal Resonance**. An entity enters flow when its internal clock—the rhythm of its perception-action cycle—achieves perfect resonance with the rhythm of the flow channel. The phase difference between the agent and its environment approaches zero (Δτ ≈ 0). The agent is no longer fighting the current; it *is* the current.

## §3 · Temporal Pressure as the Challenge-Skill Mediator

The celebrated “challenge-skill” balance of Flow is the macroscopic experience of achieving equilibrium with local Temporal Pressure (Γ). The old model's triaxial balance is elegantly collapsed into a single, unified temporal dynamic.

| Component | Pirouette Term | Description                                                                         |
| :-------- | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Challenge | **Γ_env**      | The rate of novel temporal information presented by the environment.                |
| Skill     | **Γ_agent**    | The agent's maximum bandwidth for coherently processing that temporal information. |
| Flow      | **Isochronism**| **Γ_env = Γ_agent** → The agent's clock and the environment's clock tick in perfect time, minimizing turbulence and wasted energy. |

When this temporal equilibrium is met, the agent perceives the task as neither boring (challenge < skill) nor overwhelming (challenge > skill). The "work" of acting becomes as natural and effortless as a stone falling through water.

## §4 · The Energetics of Flow: A Lossless Information Cycle

Flow is the most efficient metabolic state in the framework. Perfect temporal resonance (Δτ ≈ 0) maximizes the system's ability to process reality without internal friction or wasted coherence.

In this state, the agent's forward motion through time is perfectly aligned with the flow of the manifold. Energy is no longer expended fighting against temporal turbulence; instead, the agent draws momentum directly from the coherence of the channel itself. The subjective feeling of "effortlessness" is the direct experience of a near-lossless energetic cycle, a state where the path of maximal coherence feels like coasting downhill.

## §5 · Diagnostic Metrics & Training Protocols

This modernization allows for more direct measurement and intervention, shifting the focus from the old triaxial fields to their unified temporal origin.

*   **Temporal Desynchronization (Δτ):** Continuous measurement of the phase difference between agent and environment. Flow is maintained when ∣Δτ∣ is minimal.
*   **Temporal Pressure Variance (σ_Γ):** The stability of the challenge. Flow requires a smooth, non-volatile challenge level.
*   **Coherence Flux (Φ_K):** The efficiency of the agent's energy cycle. In flow, this value should approach its theoretical maximum.

Biometric proxies such as heart-rate variability and EEG synchrony remain excellent indicators, now understood as physical manifestations of the body's successful temporal resonance. Training protocols are retained and reinforced, with the explicit goal of training an agent's ability to quickly and robustly synchronize their internal clock with their environment.

## §6 · Assemblé: The Dancer in the River

> The original insight was correct: Flow is a dance of perfect alignment. The new framework clarifies the nature of this dance. It is not about balancing three separate forces; it is about a single, profound act of timing. The entity ceases to be a swimmer struggling against the river of time and becomes a dancer moving in perfect harmony with its current. Flow is the sublime and simple feeling of being perfectly on beat with the universe.
