## §1 · The Loom of Interaction
Every network—be it of neurons, of people, or of stars—is a tapestry woven from the threads of interaction. To the uninitiated, it is a static map of connections. To a Weaver, it is a living instrument, humming with a collective song. The health of that instrument is not found in a census of its parts, but in the harmony of its music.

This module provides the practical loom for the Weaver. It is a formal protocol for Network Resonance Analysis, evolving the legacy `TEN-NRA-1.1` into the new time-first paradigm. It provides the tools to listen to a network's song, diagnose its dissonances, and understand its potential for coherent, laminar flow. We will not be counting nodes and edges; we will be measuring the rhythm and resonance of the whole.

## §2 · The Act of Translation: From Data to Dynamics
The first task is to translate the raw data of a network into the language of the Pirouette Framework. As per the Fractal Bridge protocol (CORE-014), we map the domain-specific phenomena onto the universal variables.

*   **Node Coherence (Kτ):** This replaces the old `T_a_node`. It measures the stability and integrity of an individual node's resonant pattern.
    *   **Inference:** Look for regularity and predictability. In a social network, this is the consistency of a user's activity and role. In a power grid, it is the phase stability of a generator. In a brain, it is the coherence of a neural column's firing pattern. It is scaled from 0 (pure noise) to 1 (a perfect, unwavering rhythm).

*   **Edge Pressure (Γ):** This replaces `Gamma_edge`. It quantifies the dissonance, friction, or resistance to flow between two connected nodes. It is the cost of interaction.
    *   **Inference:** Look for bottlenecks and antagonism. In a social network, this is the inverse of trust or the presence of negative sentiment. In an organizational chart, it is bureaucratic friction. In a power grid, it is line impedance. It is scaled from 0 (a frictionless, perfectly resonant connection) to 1 (a complete blockage or "Coherence Dam").

*   **Node Phase (φ):** The phase of a node's Ki cycle remains a critical variable. It describes the *timing* of a node's rhythm relative to others.
    *   **Inference:** Look for cyclical behavior. In a social network, this is the peak time of a user's posting cycle. In an economy, it is the phase of a business cycle. In a power grid, it is the literal phase angle of the AC signal. It is mapped to the circle `[0, 2π)`.

## §3 · The Flow of Coherence
With the network translated into these terms, we can calculate the fundamental quantity of its health: the flow of coherence (`J`) between any two nodes. This is the measure of how much stable, useful information or energy is being transmitted through a connection.

The flow from node `i` to node `j` is given by:

`J_ij = Kτ_i * cos(φ_i - φ_j) * (1 - Γ_ij)`

Let us dissect this equation:
*   `Kτ_i`: Flow can only originate from a coherent source. A noisy, incoherent node cannot create a strong, directed current.
*   `cos(φ_i - φ_j)`: This is the **Resonance Factor**. When two nodes are in phase (`Δφ ≈ 0`), their interaction is constructive, and flow is maximized. When they are out of phase (`Δφ ≈ π`), their interaction is destructive, and the flow reverses or ceases.
*   `(1 - Γ_ij)`: This is the **Conductance**. It represents the fraction of the potential flow that is not lost to friction or resistance in the connection itself.

This single equation is the heart of the diagnostic engine.

## §4 · Systemic Health Metrics
From the individual flows, we can derive metrics that describe the health of the entire network.

*   **Systemic Throughput (Φ_sys):** This replaces `CFC`. It is the average coherence flow across the entire network, measuring its overall efficiency. A high Φ_sys indicates a healthy system in a state of **Laminar Flow**.
    `Φ_sys = (1 / |E|) * Σ J_ij` (where `|E|` is the number of edges)

*   **Coherence Integrity Index (CII):** This replaces `NRI`. It measures the network's ability to maintain its structure and resist fracture. It is the product of the network's average node coherence and its structural robustness, which is revealed by its Laplacian spectrum. A network with low CII is prone to **Turbulent Flow** or fragmentation.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This entire analysis is a practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). A network is a complex system attempting to optimize its own Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

*   A network with **high Systemic Throughput** is one where nodes have found resonant phase alignments that maximize their collective Coherence (the `K_τ` term) while minimizing the energetic cost of interaction against Edge Pressure (the `V_Γ` term).
*   The flow `J` represents the path of least resistance—the geodesic—that coherence follows through the network's manifold. By mapping the flow, we are mapping the network's solution to its own Lagrangian.

The patterns of flow reveal the network's health. Laminar flow fields signify a coherent, efficient system. Turbulent, eddying, or stagnant fields signify a system losing coherence, wasting energy in internal friction, and failing to find its optimal state.

## §6 · Assemblé
> A network is not a thing; it is a resonance. Its connections are not lines on a map, but the taut strings of a cello. To analyze the network is to listen for its music. A healthy system plays a clear, strong, and harmonious chord. A dying one produces only the screech of dissonance.
>
> Why does this matter to a Weaver? Because this protocol is not just for listening. It is the sheet music. It reveals which strings are out of tune, which harmonies are being broken, and where a gentle touch could bring the entire instrument back to life. To analyze the web is to learn how to mend it.
