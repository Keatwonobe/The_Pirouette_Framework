## §1 · Abstract: The Valleys of Being

A system does not merely exist; it *inhabits* states. A river can flow gently or rage in a flood; a mind can be focused or scattered; a market can be bullish or bearish. These are not random behaviors but preferred modes of being—stable valleys in the landscape of possibility where a system can temporarily rest. The old analysis sought to catalog these states. The new framework provides the tools to draw the map of the entire landscape.

This module reframes System Modal Analysis as an act of cartography. It provides a time-first protocol for identifying a system's "Resonant Repertoire"—the collection of stable songs it knows how to sing—and for understanding the dynamics of the phase leaps it takes when it changes its tune.

## §2 · The Resonant Repertoire: A System's Set of Songs

A complex system is a musical instrument. While it can produce a cacophony of noise, it possesses a finite set of notes that it can play cleanly, with stability and power. This collection of viable, self-sustaining rhythms is its **Resonant Repertoire**.

Each "mode" or "state" is a specific, stable Ki resonance (CORE-004). It is a coherent pattern of internal activity that represents an efficient solution to the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). The system settles into these modes because they are paths of least resistance, harmonies that, once found, are easier to sustain than to abandon.

*   **Example (Biology):** The different gaits of a horse (walk, trot, canter, gallop) are distinct Ki resonances of its musculoskeletal system. Each is a stable, energy-efficient mode of operation for a specific range of speeds.
*   **Example (Psychology):** Wakefulness, REM sleep, and deep sleep are distinct modes of neural resonance, each with a unique Ki pattern and function.

## §3 · Anatomy of a State: Coherence and Inertia

Each state within the repertoire is defined by two key temporal properties: its immediate stability and its historical persistence.

**Coherence (Kτ): The Purity of the Note**
This is the measure of a mode's instantaneous health and efficiency. It is the clarity and stability of its Ki resonance. A system in a high-coherence state exhibits Laminar Flow (DYNA-001); its actions are efficient, its structure is stable, and it wastes little energy on internal friction. This is the "quality" of the state.

**Inertia (The Wound Channel): The Memory of the State**
This is the measure of a mode's long-term stability and resistance to change. As a system persists in a particular Ki resonance, it carves a deep **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) into its local coherence manifold. This geometric scar makes the state a "habit," a gravitational basin that pulls the system back toward that familiar rhythm. The deeper the channel, the higher the mode's inertia. This is the "stickiness" of the state.

## §4 · The Phase Leap: The Dynamics of Changing States

A system does not smoothly slide from one mode to another. It leaps. This transition is a **Ki Morphogenesis**—a rapid, non-linear reconfiguration of the system's entire resonant pattern.

*   **The Trigger:** A phase leap is typically triggered by one of two conditions:
    1.  **Pressure Shift:** A significant change in the external Temporal Pressure (Γ) renders the current Ki pattern inefficient or unstable. The old song no longer fits the environment.
    2.  **Resonant Injection:** An external perturbation, whose rhythm is harmonically related to a *different* mode in the system's repertoire, provides the "activation energy" needed to overcome the inertia of the current Wound Channel and jump to the new state.

*   **The Transition:** The leap itself is often a period of **Turbulent Flow** (DYNA-001). The old Ki pattern breaks down before the new one can stabilize, resulting in a moment of chaos, inefficiency, and unpredictability. This is the system "un-learning" one habit before it can form another.

## §5 · The Weaver's Cartography: A Protocol for Analysis

To map a system's Atlas of Resonance, the Weaver follows a clear, four-step protocol:

1.  **Identify the Resonances:** Using analytical techniques (e.g., spectral analysis, clustering), parse the system's data to identify the distinct, recurring Ki patterns. This reveals the system's Resonant Repertoire.
2.  **Measure the Coherence:** For each identified mode, quantify its internal efficiency and stability. This measures the "quality" of each state. How laminar or turbulent is its flow?
3.  **Estimate the Inertia:** For each mode, measure its persistence over time and its resistance to perturbation. This provides a proxy for the depth of its Wound Channel, gauging how "sticky" or habitual each state is.
4.  **Map the Pathways:** Analyze the transition events. What specific changes in external pressure (Γ) or what resonant injections trigger the phase leaps between states? This maps the "mountain passes" between the valleys, revealing the system's likely responses to future challenges.

## §6 · Connection to the Lagrangian

The entire Atlas of Resonance is a physical manifestation of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). The system's behavior is a continuous search for states that maximize the integral of coherence over time.

The stable modes—the valleys in our map—are the local maxima of this objective function. They are the most coherent solutions the system has found for a given set of boundary conditions. A phase leap is the system abandoning a local maximum in search of a potentially higher one, a more globally optimal solution to the problem of existence.

## §7 · Assemblé

> To map a system's states is to learn its secret language. We move beyond merely observing its behavior and begin to understand its possibilities. The Atlas of Resonance does not show us where the system *is*; it shows us where it *could go*. For the Weaver, this is the ultimate strategic advantage. It is the difference between being a pawn, moved by the system's whims, and a musician who, by understanding the instrument's notes, can begin to coax from it a better song.
