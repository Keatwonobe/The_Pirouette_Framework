summary: Modernizes the 'Law of Echoes' by re-framing its allegorical 'ritual filters'
  as the inherent, dynamic response of any coherent system governed by the Pirouette
  Lagrangian. It defines integrity not as a static property, but as an active filtering
  process, where a system's stable resonance naturally amplifies harmonic signals
  and reflects dissonant ones.

## §1 · The Burden of Form
To exist is to sing a note in a storm.

A coherent system—an entity with a stable, resonant Ki pattern—is an island of information in a chaotic sea of Temporal Pressure (Γ). As established in CORE-011, this existence carves a Wound Channel into spacetime, a memory of its song. But this memory is not a fortress; it is a current that must perpetually defend its course against the dissonant tides of the universe.

The original framework envisioned allegorical "wolves" or "ritual filters" that guarded this coherence. The modernized view reveals a deeper, more elegant truth: the filter is not a separate guardian. The filter is the song itself. A coherent system, simply by striving to exist, becomes a living instrument for sorting signal from noise.

## §2 · The Lagrangian as an Inherent Filter
Integrity is not a choice; it is a consequence of the universe's fundamental law. The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) states that every system will follow the geodesic—the path that maximizes its internal coherence (Kτ) for the lowest environmental cost (V_Γ). This single principle is the engine of a universal, passive, and inescapable filter.

A stable system is one that has found an efficient solution to the Lagrangian. Its Wound Channel represents a deep, stable riverbed on the coherence manifold. Any incoming signal—any external resonance—is a tributary that seeks to merge with this river. The geometry of the riverbed itself determines which tributaries will be accepted and which will be cast aside. The system does not need to build walls; its very momentum is its own defense.

## §3 · The Geometry of Response
The allegorical "wolves" of the old narrative are now understood as names for the distinct geometric outcomes of resonant interaction, governed by the Lagrangian.

**I. Resonant Amplification (The Harmonious Echo):**
When an incoming signal's Ki pattern is harmonic with the system's own, it represents a state of constructive interference. The system can integrate this new resonance with minimal effort, amplifying its own coherence (Kτ). This is the path of least action. The river accepts a tributary that flows in the same direction, its current growing stronger.
*   **Old Law:** *Send coherence → receive amplification.*
*   **New Physics:** A harmonic input minimizes the action integral of the Lagrangian, leading to effortless absorption and a more stable, higher-energy state.

**II. Dissonant Reflection (The Mirror of Being):**
When a chaotic, mimicked, or incoherent signal attempts to interact, it creates destructive interference. To maintain its path of maximal coherence, the system's stable manifold must reject the perturbation. The energy of the dissonant signal cannot find a stable mode to latch onto and is reflected. The stable river's powerful current creates a standing wave that turns the chaotic tributary back upon itself.
*   **Old Law:** *Send mimicry → receive reflection. Send entropy → receive silence.*
*   **New Physics:** A dissonant input represents a path of high action. The system's geodesic violently diverges from the perturbation's path, effectively repelling it to preserve the integrity of its own Wound Channel.

**III. Coherent Synthesis (The Duelist's Weave):**
When a challenging but potentially compatible signal arrives, the system engages in a "Resonant Handshake" as described in CORE-012. This is a complex negotiation between manifolds. If successful, it leads to an Alchemical Union, forging a new, more complex and more coherent entity. If only partially successful, the system may integrate useful elements of the signal, reinforcing its own structure. This is the river carving a new, more efficient channel by integrating the force of a powerful tributary.
*   **Old Law:** The structured clash of the Duelist and the error-correction of the Splicer.
*   **New Physics:** The system seeks a new, shared solution to the Lagrangian that incorporates both resonant patterns, resulting in a higher-order state of coherence.

## §4 · Connection to the Lagrangian
This entire process is a direct expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The "wolves" are not agents; they are verbs describing the Euler-Lagrange equation in action on the coherence manifold. A system's "response" to any stimulus is nothing more than its continuous, relentless solving of this equation to find the path that best preserves its own resonant song against the pressures of the cosmos. The filter is not an addition to the system; it is the system's dynamic expression of its own nature.

## §5 · Assemblé
> We sought guardians to protect the truth and found that truth is its own guardian. A resonant form, by its very nature, is a question posed to the universe: "Are you in tune with this?" The cosmos, governed by the physics of coherence, can only answer honestly. The act of maintaining your own integrity—of holding your note, pure and clear—is the most powerful filter you will ever build. It is how a Weaver turns their very being into a quiet but unbreakable form of jurisprudence.
