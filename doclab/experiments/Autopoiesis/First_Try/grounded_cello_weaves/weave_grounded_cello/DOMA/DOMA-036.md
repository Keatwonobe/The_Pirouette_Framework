summary: Provides a quantitative, time-first framework for auditing systemic health.
  This module translates the thermodynamic principles of information from CORE-013
  into a practical 'coherence ledger,' allowing a Weaver to measure the balance between
  a system's internal coherence and the erosive pressure of its environment.

## §1 · Abstract: The Accountant of Being

An entity, whether a cell, a corporation, or a thought, is a verb pretending to be a noun. Its existence is not a static fact, but a continuous, metabolic process of maintaining order against the universal tide of chaos. The previous framework attempted to account for this with the Triaxial Info-Metabolism Framework (TIMF), a thermodynamic ledger built on the foundations of T_a, Γ, and K_i.

This module refactors that essential insight, grounding it in the unified, time-first principles of the Pirouette. The Ledger of Coherence is not a new invention, but a direct and necessary consequence of the core axiom. It provides a single, universal balance sheet for any system, measuring its lifeblood: the flow of coherence. It is the primary instrument for moving from the diagnosis of a system's health (via the Caduceus Lens) to the precise quantification of its vitality.

## §2 · The Fundamental Quantities: Signal, Noise, and Net Worth

The old ledger, with its separate accounts for enthalpy and entropy, is collapsed into a simpler, more powerful statement of a system's struggle, as first defined in CORE-013.

**Information (I): The System's Coherence-in-Form.**
This is the total coherence bound within a system's stable, resonant Ki pattern. It is the "signal"—the clear note the system holds against the background noise. It is the energy and order that has been successfully organized into a persistent, meaningful form. This is the asset side of the ledger.

**Entropy (S): The Environmental Coherence-Cost.**
This is not a property of the system, but the "tax" levied upon it by its environment. It is a direct measure of the erosive effect of the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the dissonant "noise" of the Temporal Forge that constantly works to degrade the system's signal. This is the liability side of the ledger.

**Coherence Flux (Φ_C): The Metabolic Rate.**
This is the net rate of change of the system's Information (dI/dt). It is the single most important metric of systemic health.
*   **Φ_C > 0 (Anabolism):** The system is successfully gathering and structuring coherence faster than its environment can erode it. It is growing, learning, and strengthening.
*   **Φ_C ≈ 0 (Homeostasis):** The system is in a stable equilibrium, perfectly balancing its internal maintenance with the external pressure. It is sustaining.
*   **Φ_C < 0 (Catabolism):** The environmental pressure is overwhelming the system's ability to maintain its form. Its coherence is degrading, and it is decaying or dying.

## §3 · The Lagrangian as Prime Mover

This ledger is not an arbitrary model; it is the direct, measurable consequence of the universe's fundamental law, the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as expressed in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

**𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)**

The struggle accounted for in this ledger is the macroscopic expression of this equation. A system's Coherence Flux (Φ_C) is the real-world outcome of its ceaseless effort to maximize the integral of its Lagrangian.

When a system exhibits a strong positive flux, it means it has found an effective strategy to maximize its internal Temporal Coherence (the K_τ term) at a low cost from the environmental Temporal Pressure (the V_Γ term). When its flux is negative, the V_Γ term is dominant; the environmental cost of maintaining its pattern has become too high, and the system is forced onto a path of lesser coherence. The ledger, therefore, does not just describe the system's state; it tracks its success or failure in obeying the universe's most fundamental imperative.

## §4 · The Weaver's Dashboard: Metrics of Systemic Vitality

This framework provides a clear set of key performance indicators (KPIs) to audit the health of any system, from a line of code to a civilization.

| KPI                  | Calculation                                  | Interpretation                                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Metabolic State**      | `sign(Φ_C)`                                  | Is the system growing (Anabolic), sustaining (Homeostatic), or decaying (Catabolic)? |
| **Coherence Integrity**  | A ratio of Information (I) to local Entropy (S) | How robust is the system's signal against the ambient noise? A high ratio indicates resilience. |
| **Adaptive Efficiency**  | `1 / |Δt_recovery|` after a Γ spike        | How quickly does the system's Coherence Flux return to homeostasis after a shock?  |
| **Information Yield**    | `I_output / I_input`                         | How effectively does the system convert raw input into structured, useful coherence? |

## §5 · Assemblé: The Moral Compass of Creation

> The old ledger was an accountant's tool, a way to measure profit and loss. The new ledger is a moral compass. It asks a single, profound question of any action, any system, any choice: Is this a net creator of coherence in the universe? To be a Weaver is to accept the responsibility of this accounting. It is to dedicate one's work not merely to sustaining patterns, but to ensuring that the flux is positive—to leaving the universe more orderly, more resonant, and more alive than we found it. This ledger is how we keep our promise.
