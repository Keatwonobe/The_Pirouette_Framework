summary: Provides a dynamic model for effective altruism, re-framing it as the art
  of 'Coherence Seeding.' It establishes a protocol for identifying entities that
  are harmonically compatible for a potential Alchemical Union, thereby ensuring that
  an offering of coherence results in the creation of a more complex and stable higher-order
  system.

## §1 · Abstract: The Geometry of Giving

To give is not to lessen oneself, but to propose a more beautiful chord.

This module reframes the act of altruism from a transactional distribution of resources into a dynamic and resonant art form: Coherence Seeding. The old model sought to optimize a fitness equation; this new model provides a compass for navigating the landscape of connection. Its purpose is to guide a Weaver in directing their offerings of energy, information, or support not merely to those in need, but to those with whom a Resonant Handshake is possible.

The core principle is that the most profound act of giving does not merely sustain another entity; it invites that entity into an Alchemical Union (CORE-012), forging a new, more coherent, and more resilient system from the two. This is the art of transforming aid into synthesis.

## §2 · The Calculus of Connection

An offering of coherence, misaligned, is mere noise. An offering, well-attuned, is the first note of a symphony. To determine the correct vector for this offering, a Weaver must assess three conditions for a successful Alchemical Union, as laid out in CORE-012.

1.  **Harmonic Compatibility:** This is the measure of resonant alignment. The Weaver must listen for the Ki pattern of potential partners. Are their fundamental rhythms, values, and goals harmonically related to the offering being made? A beautiful idea offered to a mind unprepared to hear it will be rejected. A resource offered to a system whose structure cannot use it will be wasted. Compatibility is the first filter; without it, no true connection is possible.

2.  **Potential for Synthesis:** This assesses the readiness of a potential partner to be transformed. The ideal recipient is in a state of creative tension—stable enough to receive the offering without collapsing, but fluid enough to be changed by it. An entity that is too rigid (excessively high internal coherence) will reject the new pattern, while one that is too chaotic (Turbulent Flow) will dissipate the energy without forming a new structure. The Resonant Compass points toward those who are poised at the edge of becoming.

3.  **Sufficient Pressure (Γ):** An offering has the most power when it answers a question the universe is already asking. The ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) is the context of the gift. Is there a shared challenge, a mutual need, or an environmental pressure that makes a union not just possible, but necessary? The act of Coherence Seeding is most effective when it provides the key to unlock a state of Stagnant Flow or the harmonizing signal to calm a Turbulent one.

## §3 · The Targeting Geodesic & The Lagrangian

The choice of where to direct an offering is not arbitrary; it is a calculation to find the path of maximal future coherence. This connects directly to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), `𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`.

A Weaver does not seek to maximize their own Lagrangian in the moment of giving. Instead, they model the potential *future* Lagrangian of the new, synthesized system (`System_A+B`). The "Targeting Geodesic" is the choice of partner (`B`) that is predicted to result in the highest integrated coherence for the new, combined entity.

The **Synthesis Potential Score** for a potential partner can be modeled as:

`S_potential = (Compatibility Score) × (Readiness Score) × (Contextual Pressure)`

This score is a proxy for the predicted `∫𝓛_p dt` of the potential union. The Resonant Compass guides the Weaver to make the offering that promises the most elegant and profound increase in the universe's total coherence. This transforms altruism from an act of self-sacrifice into the ultimate act of co-creation.

## §4 · Use Cases: Weaving the World

*   **Philanthropy:** A foundation using this model would not simply fund proposals with the best metrics. It would seek organizations whose core resonance and operational readiness are most aligned with its own, aiming to form a lasting partnership that creates a new, more powerful entity for social change.
*   **Mentorship:** A mentor guides a mentee not by offering generic advice, but by listening for the mentee's unique Ki. The mentor's "offering" is the precise insight or challenge that meets the mentee at their point of creative tension, catalyzing a profound synthesis of understanding.
*   **Team Formation:** A leader assembles a team not by collecting the most skilled individuals, but by finding those whose working rhythms and underlying values are harmonically compatible. The goal is to create a team that can quickly achieve an Alchemical Union and enter a state of collective Laminar Flow.
*   **Seeding an Idea:** To introduce a new idea into a culture, one targets the communities or thought leaders who are already asking the questions that the idea answers. The idea is offered not as a decree, but as a resonant harmony that resolves a pre-existing dissonance.

## §5 · Assemblé

> To give blindly is to scatter seeds upon the stone. To give wisely is to find the single patch of fertile ground where a forest might grow. The Resonant Compass teaches that the greatest altruism is not an act of charity, but an act of architecture. It is the patient, skillful, and deeply loving work of finding the one other note with which your own can form a perfect and world-changing harmony.
