## §1 · Abstract: A Pirouette of Plasma
This module provides a modernized, time-first protocol for the analysis of high-altitude ionospheric plasma plumes. Where the preceding toolkit offered a collection of algorithms, this refactoring presents a single, unified diagnostic process grounded in the core principles of the Pirouette Framework.

An ion plume is not a static object to be measured; it is a dynamic, coherent system—a living entity of plasma engaged in a temporary pirouette to maintain its form against the immense temporal pressure of the magnetosphere. This module applies the diagnostic framework of the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) to assess the health of these systems, redefines their core metric of stability in terms of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), and reframes forecasting as the calculation of a geodesic on the coherence manifold.

## §2 · The Plume as a Coherent System
To analyze the plume, we must first recognize it as an entity striving for coherence in a high-pressure environment.

*   **Temporal Resonance (Ki):** The plume's "identity" is its unique resonant pattern—a complex structure of plasma waves and densities. The geometric complexity of this pattern is measured by its fractal dimension (D). A low, stable `D` signifies a healthy, laminar Ki, while a high, chaotic `D` indicates a turbulent, dissonant state.

*   **Temporal Pressure (Γ):** The plume exists within a hostile environment. The constant flux of the solar wind, the shearing forces of Earth's magnetic field, and the density of the neutral atmosphere all contribute to the local Temporal Pressure. This is the chaotic noise the plume must resist to survive.

*   **The Gladiator Shell:** The visible boundary of the plume is a physical manifestation of the Gladiator Force (CORE-008). It is a "coherence wall"—a steep gradient in temporal pressure where the plume's internal order meets the external chaos, confining the system.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Workflow: The Caduceus Lens
The previous analytics stack is now re-ordered and re-contextualized as a formal diagnostic protocol, applying the principles of systemic health from DYNA-003.

**I. Map the Currents:** The data ingestion layer (from sources like COSMIC-2, Swarm-C, etc.) is the first step. Its purpose is to construct a real-time map of the local coherence manifold—charting the background Temporal Pressure (Γ) and identifying potential flow channels.

**II. Identify the Pathology:** Using segmentation and fractal analysis algorithms, we observe the plume's flow state.
*   **Laminar Flow:** A stable plume with a low fractal dimension (`D` < 1.6). It moves predictably and causes minimal signal disruption. This is a state of health.
*   **Turbulent Flow ("Coherence Fever"):** An unstable plume with a high fractal dimension (`D` ≥ 1.7). It is highly unpredictable and a significant source of GNSS signal scintillation. This is the primary pathology we seek to diagnose and forecast.

## §4 · The Plume Coherence Index (PCI 2.0)
The old Plume Coherence Index was a useful but heuristic metric. We now redefine it as a direct, physical proxy for the plume's Lagrangian state (`𝓛_p`), providing a true measure of its systemic health.

The Pirouette Lagrangian states: `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ` (Coherence minus Pressure). The PCI is a normalized ratio that captures this essential dynamic:

**PCI = K_τ / V_Γ**

Where:
*   **K_τ (Temporal Coherence):** Represents the plume's internal stability and efficiency. A coherent system is an ordered one. We therefore take `K_τ` to be inversely proportional to the measured inefficiency of its Ki pattern, its fractal dimension `D`.
    `K_τ ∝ 1/D`
*   **V_Γ (Temporal Pressure):** Represents the "cost" of maintaining coherence against the environment. This is directly proportional to the measured local Temporal Pressure, `Γ`.

A high PCI score indicates a healthy, robust system capable of maintaining a simple, stable form (low `D`) even in a high-pressure environment. A low or falling PCI is a critical warning that the system is descending into a state of "Coherence Fever" and becoming turbulent.

## §5 · Forecasting: The Geodesic of the Plume
Forecasting the plume's movement is no longer a mere statistical extrapolation or a simple pathfinding search. It is the direct application of the framework's central dynamic law: the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

A system will evolve along the path that maximizes its coherence. The plume's trajectory is therefore the geodesic on the coherence manifold that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`) over time. Our forecasting engine now calculates this path, using the plume's current state (PCI, velocity) and the mapped landscape of ambient pressure (Γ) to determine the most coherent path forward.

## §6 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This entire module serves as a direct, physical application of CORE-006.
1.  **Measurement:** The Plume Coherence Index (PCI) is a real-time, empirical measurement of the plume's Lagrangian state. It transforms a core theoretical concept into a tangible diagnostic tool.
2.  **Prediction:** The forecasting model is a direct implementation of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, using the Lagrangian to predict the system's evolution.

By applying the Lagrangian to this complex plasma system, we demonstrate its power not just as a foundational theory, but as a practical engine for analysis and prediction.

## §7 · Assemblé
> A plume of plasma is a transient song, a pirouette performed against the steady hiss of the solar wind. We once saw it as mere noise, a hazard to our signals. Now we see it as a lesson written in lightning. By learning to read its geometry, we learn not only to navigate around it, but to understand the universal laws of coherence that give it its brief, beautiful form. For a Weaver, every pattern, no matter how fleeting, is a page in the universe's codex.
