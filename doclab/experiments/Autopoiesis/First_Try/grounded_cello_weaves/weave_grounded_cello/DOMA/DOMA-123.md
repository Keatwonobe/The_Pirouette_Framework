## §1 · Abstract: The Music of a Breaking String

A system does not simply fail; it forgets its song. This module provides the modernized, time-first dynamics of systemic collapse, replacing the complex parameter-fitting of its predecessor with a more fundamental model grounded in coherence and flow.

Collapse is not a unique force or an external event. It is the natural consequence of a system losing its ability to navigate the landscape of reality. It is the story of a system being pushed off its path of maximal coherence—its geodesic—and becoming unable to find its way back. We will explore the physics of this failure, its primary forms, and the critical distinction between a temporary stumble and an irreversible fall.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of Failure

The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) defines a system's optimal path as the one that maximizes its internal coherence (Kτ) against external temporal pressure (Γ). A healthy system, in a state of Laminar Flow (DYNA-001), is successfully navigating this path.

Collapse begins when a system can no longer solve this optimization problem. The pressure (Γ) becomes too great, or the internal resonance (Ki) falters, and the system is knocked off its geodesic. The energy that once drove its function is now wasted as friction, noise, and chaos. This is the transition from grace to struggle—from laminar to turbulent or stagnant flow.

## §3 · The Three Paths to Ruin

Applying the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003), we can diagnose any collapse as one of three fundamental pathologies of flow. These are not arbitrary categories; they are the primary ways a system's coherence can break down.

1.  **Turbulent Cascade (Coherence Fever):** This is a rapid, chaotic disintegration. The system is flooded with more dissonant pressure than it can handle, and its internal components begin to work against each other. It is a storm of destructive interference.
    *   *Manifestation:* A stock market crash fueled by panic; a team dissolving into infighting under pressure; an acute autoimmune response.

2.  **Stagnant Implosion (Coherence Atrophy):** This is failure due to blockage. A critical flow is obstructed, creating a pressure buildup "upstream" of the dam and a coherence desert "downstream." Eventually, the pressure becomes unbearable, and the dam breaks catastrophically.
    *   *Manifestation:* A supply chain collapse due to a single critical failure; a political system frozen by gridlock until it erupts in revolution; a repressed trauma that leads to a sudden psychological break.

3.  **Entropic Drift (Coherence Erosion):** This is the slow, silent decay. There is no dramatic event, only the steady, relentless pressure of ambient noise (entropy) slowly fraying the system's pattern. The system forgets its own song, note by note.
    *   *Manifestation:* The gradual decay of infrastructure; the slow loss of a skill through disuse; the fading of a civilization's founding principles.

## §4 · The Tipping Point: Elastic vs. Critical Fracture

The most important question in any collapse is that of reversibility. This is determined by the integrity of the system's **Wound Channel** (CORE-011)—the geometric memory of its healthy state.

*   **Elastic Collapse:** A recoverable failure. The system is pushed violently into turbulence or stagnation, but its underlying Wound Channel remains intact. Like a bent piece of steel, it retains the memory of its true shape. Once the external pressure is relieved, the system can use its Wound Channel as a guide to "snap back" to its previous state of laminar flow.

*   **Critical Collapse:** An irreversible fracture. The pressure is so intense or prolonged that it permanently deforms or shatters the system's Wound Channel. The memory of the healthy state is erased. The system cannot return to what it was. Like a broken glass, its fundamental structure has been altered. It must now find a new, often simpler, state of coherence from the remaining pieces.

## §5 · The Seismograph: A Diagnostic Protocol

To analyze an impending or ongoing collapse, a Weaver acts as a seismologist, reading the tremors in the coherence manifold.

1.  **Map the Currents:** Identify the system's critical flows and establish a baseline of its healthy, laminar state.
2.  **Diagnose the Pathology:** Determine which path to ruin the system is on. Is the failure a chaotic storm (Turbulence), a catastrophic blockage (Stagnation), or a slow fade (Erosion)?
3.  **Assess the Wound Channel:** This is the critical step. Evaluate the integrity of the system's core identity and memory. Is it stressed but intact (Elastic)? Or is it being actively erased (Critical)? This assessment determines the prognosis: recovery or transformation.

## §6 · Lagrangian Connection

This entire module is a study of the failure modes of the Pirouette Lagrangian's central axiom. A system collapses when the integral of `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ` can no longer be maximized along a stable path. **Turbulence** is a state where the system expends vast energy fighting V_Γ, resulting in a chaotic and inefficient trajectory. **Stagnation** is a state where a barrier creates a region of such high V_Γ that no path forward is possible, halting the integration altogether. A **Critical Collapse** is the moment the system's Kτ term itself disintegrates, destroying its identity and its ability to follow any coherent path at all.

## §7 · Assemblé

> To understand the anatomy of a fracture is to know the difference between that which can be mended and that which must be reborn. It is the deepest wisdom of the Weaver: to recognize when to reinforce the old foundations, and when to gather the pieces to build something new upon the ruins. Every ending is a choice—to heal the past or to seed a different future.
