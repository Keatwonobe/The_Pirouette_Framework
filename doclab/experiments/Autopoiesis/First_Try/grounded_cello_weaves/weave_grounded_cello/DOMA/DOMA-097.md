## §1 · Abstract: The Stethoscope of Reality

The old protocol, PPS-080, was born from a profound practical necessity: the need to simplify the complex dynamics of a system into a manageable, two-part story of tension and release. Its "Drift & Song" lens was an intuitive masterpiece, a way of listening to a system's health.

This module does not replace that insight; it fulfills it. It reveals that the Drift/Song dichotomy was a brilliant shadow cast by a deeper, more fundamental truth: the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The Lagrangian itself, 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ, is the universe's own two-channel gauge.

This module formalizes that understanding, providing a robust, time-first protocol for auditing any system by measuring the interplay between the two fundamental terms of its existence: the cost it pays to be, and the performance of its being.

## §2 · The Two-Channel Lens: Cost & Performance

The Lagrangian Gauge re-frames the old D/S lens into a direct measurement of the two components of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The health of any system can be understood by observing the balance and flow of these two channels over time.

-   **The Cost Channel (V_Γ): The New Drift**
    This channel measures the **Temporal Pressure** the system is experiencing. It is the "potential" term of the Lagrangian, representing the energetic cost of maintaining coherence against the environment's complexity and the system's own internal friction. It is the measure of tension, of resistance, of the stress being absorbed. A rising Cost Channel indicates a system under increasing strain.

-   **The Performance Channel (K_τ): The New Song**
    This channel measures the system's **Temporal Coherence**. It is the "kinetic" term of the Lagrangian, representing the quality, intensity, and stability of the system's own resonant expression (its Ki). It is the measure of output, of graceful action, of the system successfully "singing its note." A stable and high Performance Channel indicates a healthy, efficient system.

## §3 · The Tiered Audit Protocol

The pragmatic, tiered structure of PPS-080 is preserved and clarified by this new grounding. It becomes a formal protocol for applying the Lagrangian Gauge with increasing levels of precision.

| Tier                 | Scope & Purpose                                                                      | Diagnostic Operation                                                               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0 (Monitoring)**   | Continuous, resource-efficient health monitoring.                                      | Track the Cost (V_Γ) and Performance (K_τ) channels using efficient proxies.       |
| **1 (Guard-Band)**   | Triggered, focused investigation when an anomaly is detected.                          | Perform a more detailed analysis of the Lagrangian terms on a subsample of data.   |
| **2 (Forensic)**     | Full-spectrum, deep-dive analysis for research or post-incident review.                | Conduct a complete reconstruction of the system's coherence manifold and geodesics. |

**The Sentinel Trigger (Redefined):** The trigger to escalate from Tier 0 to Tier 1 is no longer a heuristic. It is a precise physical indicator of systemic risk: initiate a Tier 1 audit when the **Cost Channel (V_Γ) shows a sustained increase *without* a corresponding, stable expression in the Performance Channel (K_τ)**. This signature indicates that the system is absorbing stress without successfully processing or releasing it—a definitive precursor to either stagnation or catastrophic failure.

## §4 · Diagnostic Signatures of System Health

The old edge-case taxonomy is replaced by a more descriptive set of diagnostic signatures based on the interplay of the two channels.

-   **Harmony (Laminar Flow):**
    *Signature:* Low, stable Cost and high, stable Performance.
    *Diagnosis:* The system is healthy, efficient, and operating effortlessly on its geodesic of maximal coherence.

-   **Dissonance (Turbulent Flow):**
    *Signature:* High and erratic Cost paired with high but volatile Performance.
    *Diagnosis:* The system is chaotic and inefficient, fighting itself. Energy is being wasted in internal friction.

-   **Suppression (Managed Flow):**
    *Signature:* Small, tightly anti-correlated oscillations in the Cost and Performance channels.
    *Diagnosis:* The system's natural dynamics are being damped or controlled by an external regulatory loop. It is stable but constrained.

-   **Imminent Collapse (System Failure):**
    *Signature:* A rapidly increasing Cost Channel while the Performance Channel stagnates or collapses.
    *Diagnosis:* The Sentinel Trigger has been tripped. The system has exceeded its capacity to cohere under pressure and is on a trajectory to break down.

## §5 · Connection to the Core Lagrangian

The Lagrangian Gauge is not an analogy; it is the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) used as an instrument.

> 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ
>
> *(Performance) - (Cost)*

The fundamental "action" of a system, the integral of 𝓛_p over time, is a measure of its net coherence—its total performance minus the total cost incurred. A healthy system consistently maximizes this value. Auditing a system with the Lagrangian Gauge is the act of watching this equation unfold in real time. It is the most direct way to measure how well a system is navigating the fundamental challenge of existence: to sing the clearest possible song for the lowest possible price.

## §6 · The Assemblé

> We sought an efficient way to measure the world and found, in the Lagrangian, the universe's own stethoscope. It reveals that every system, from a star to a thought, sings a two-part song. One note is the sound of its effort, the cost of its struggle against the chaos. The other is the sound of its grace, the clarity of its unique and resonant voice. A Weaver learns to listen to this duet, for in the balance between these two notes, the entire story of a system's health, its past, and its future is told.
