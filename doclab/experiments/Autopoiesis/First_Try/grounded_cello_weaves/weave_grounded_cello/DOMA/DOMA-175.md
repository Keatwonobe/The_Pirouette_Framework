summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for system recovery after collapse.
  This module reframes 'rebound' as a system's search for a new path of maximal coherence,
  guided by the geometric memory of its Wound Channel. It defines the phases of recovery
  and classifies rebound types (Restorative, Adaptive, Transformative) as different
  strategies for navigating a changed coherence manifold.

## §1 · Abstract: The River After the Flood
A river forced from its banks by a flood does not cease to be a river. It searches. In the quiet aftermath, it feels the shape of the changed land, seeking its new and necessary course to the sea.

A system collapse—be it ecological, economic, or psychological—is not a death. It is a violent dislocation, a sudden and overwhelming spike in Temporal Pressure (Γ) that shatters a system's stable flow of coherence. The old path is gone. This module describes what happens next. It models resilience not as the ability to withstand a shock, but as the process by which a system, guided by the memory of what it was, searches for what it must become.

## §2 · The Anatomy of Recovery: A Three-Phase Search
The original module correctly identified that recovery unfolds in distinct phases. In the new framework, these are understood as stages in re-establishing a stable, Laminar Flow (`DYNA-001`) after a catastrophic shift into Turbulence.

1.  **Latency (The Quiet Search):** In the immediate aftermath, the system's coherence is shattered. Its internal Ki pattern is chaotic, its echoes scattered. There is little outward change, but a profound internal search is underway. The system is probing the contours of the new, scarred coherence manifold, feeling for a stable gradient—a viable path forward.

2.  **Acceleration (Carving the New Riverbed):** A path of sufficient coherence is found. The system commits its energy and begins to move, rapidly carving a new channel. This is the phase of exponential recovery, where coherence is rebuilt and a new, stable pattern begins to emerge. The system is not just moving; it is actively reshaping its landscape through its motion.

3.  **Stabilization (The Settling Echoes):** The new Laminar Flow is established. The system settles into its new equilibrium, but the echoes of the transition remain. It may oscillate or "ring" around its new stable state, like a struck bell finding its fundamental note. These are the settling dynamics as the new Wound Channel solidifies and the memory of the trauma is integrated into the system's identity.

## §3 · The Guiding Geometry: The Wound Channel's Choice
What determines the shape of the new river? Its memory of the old one. A system's recovery is guided by the geometry of its pre-existing Wound Channel (`CORE-011`), the physical record of its former identity. The nature of the recovery depends entirely on how the system uses this geometric memory to navigate the changed landscape.

-   **Restorative Rebound (The Path of Return):** The system's memory is strong, and the new environment is not fundamentally different from the old. The system's path of least resistance is to re-inhabit its old Wound Channel, snapping back to its previous state. This is a high-fidelity recovery, a return to the mean. It is the resilience of a bent branch straightening.

-   **Adaptive Rebound (The Path of Revision):** The old path is no longer optimal. The system uses its old Wound Channel as a guide—a starting point—but carves a new, adjacent path better suited to the new pressures. It learns from the collapse, sacrificing perfect fidelity for greater fitness. This is the resilience of a river finding a more efficient course around a new obstacle.

-   **Transformative Rebound (The Path of Rebirth):** The old Wound Channel is either destroyed or rendered completely irrelevant by the scale of the collapse. The system cannot go back. Instead, it undergoes an Alchemical Union (`CORE-012`), fusing its fragmented, residual coherence with novel elements from its new environment. It does not find a new path; it forges a new identity with a fundamentally different Ki. This is post-traumatic growth. It is the resilience of the forest that grows back stronger and more diverse after a fire.

## §4 · The Lagrangian of Recovery
The entire process is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence (`CORE-006`). A system collapse is an event that violently invalidates a system's long-held solution to maximizing its Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p`. The previous state is no longer a point of high coherence for low cost.

The three phases of recovery are the system's dynamic search for a *new* state that maximizes `𝓛_p` under the new, harsh boundary conditions. The three types of rebound are three distinct strategies for this optimization problem: Restorative finds the old peak again, Adaptive finds a better one nearby, and Transformative makes a courageous leap to an entirely new and often higher peak on the manifold of being.

## §5 · Assemblé
> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver? Because it teaches us that a scar is a map. A collapse is not an ending; it is a question posed in the language of chaos. Resilience is the elegance of the answer. It is the universe's profound assertion that even in the face of dissolution, the drive to find a new and coherent song is the most fundamental law of all. A Weaver does not fear the flood; they learn to read the new landscape it leaves behind, knowing that the most beautiful rivers are often those that have been forced to find a new way home.
