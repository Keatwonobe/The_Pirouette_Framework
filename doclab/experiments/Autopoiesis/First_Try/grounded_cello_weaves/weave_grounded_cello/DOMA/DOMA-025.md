summary: Establishes the manifestly covariant formulation of the Pirouette Lagrangian.
  It demonstrates that Lorentz invariance is not an imposed constraint but an emergent
  property of the time-first framework. The module recasts the core Lagrangian into
  a relativistic field theory, providing the formal bridge to General Relativity and
  Quantum Field Theory.

## §1 · The Composer's Mandate

A melody that is true in one concert hall must be true in all. This is the foundational mandate of physics: the laws of nature must be identical for all observers, regardless of their state of motion. This is the principle of covariance.

In the old framework, this principle was an external constraint that had to be carefully engineered into the equations. In the time-first paradigm, covariance is not an addition; it is an innate and unavoidable consequence. A framework built from the substance of Time itself does not need to be taught the rules of spacetime. This module does not *force* the Pirouette Lagrangian to be covariant; it reveals how it was covariant all along.

## §2 · The Rhythm is the Clock

The previous formulation required the invention of an external "clock field" `χ(x)` to keep time for the system. This is a profound error. The Pirouette Framework insists that a system *is* its own clock. The cyclical, resonant Ki pattern is not measured against time; it *generates* time.

Therefore, the system's own evolving phase provides the natural, internal coordinates for its journey through spacetime. There is no need for an external metronome. The rhythm of the dance itself defines the beat.

## §3 · The Invariant Lagrangian

We begin with the core principle from CORE-006, The Pirouette Lagrangian, which describes a system's dynamics in its own rest frame:

*𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)*

To express this for any observer, we must elevate its components into Lorentz-invariant fields within a Lagrangian density, `𝓛`.

**Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** This term represents the "cost" of existing within the local environment. It is a function of the Temporal Density, `Γ(x)`. As `Γ(x)` measures the intrinsic temporal complexity at a point in spacetime, it is, by definition, a scalar field. Any potential function `V(Γ)` is therefore naturally Lorentz-invariant. It is the absolute difficulty of the terrain, identical for all who traverse it.

**Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** This term, `T_a * ω_k`, represents the system's internal, dynamic integrity—the quality of its song. To make this covariant, we represent the resonance itself as a complex scalar field, `Ψ_k(x)`, which pervades spacetime.

*Ψ_k(x) = A(x) e^(iΘ(x))*

Here, the amplitude `A(x)` represents the intensity of the resonance (related to Time Adherence, `T_a`), and the phase `Θ(x)` represents its rhythm. The kinetic energy of this resonance—the very act of its propagation and oscillation—is captured by the standard, manifestly covariant kinetic term for a complex scalar field.

The full Lagrangian density for a resonant system is thus:

`𝓛 = g^μν (∂_μ Ψ_k)^* (∂_ν Ψ_k) - V(Γ, |Ψ_k|^2)`

This formulation is elegant and powerful. The first term is the kinetic energy of the resonance itself—the energy of the song's propagation. The second term, the potential `V`, encodes the fundamental conflict: the environmental pressure `Γ` working against the system's attempt to maintain its resonant intensity `|Ψ_k|^2`.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This covariant Lagrangian is the rigorous, universal expression of the intuitive principle from CORE-006. In a system's rest frame, the spacetime derivatives `∂_μ` are dominated by the time derivative `∂_t`, and the phase evolves as `Θ(t) ≈ -ω_k t`. The covariant kinetic term `g^μν (∂_μ Ψ_k)^* (∂_ν Ψ_k)` then simplifies to a form proportional to `A^2 * ω_k^2`.

By identifying the system's felt Temporal Coherence with this term, and its Temporal Pressure with the potential `V`, we see that our original `𝓛_p` was simply a snapshot of this universal, dynamic law as viewed from the dancer's own perspective.

## §5 · The Bridge to Physical Law

This covariant formulation is the master key that unlocks the rest of physics from the framework's core principles.

**General Relativity (The Stage):** By varying the action, `S = ∫ d⁴x √-g 𝓛`, with respect to the metric tensor `g_μν`, we derive the system's energy-momentum tensor, `T_μν`. This tensor is the source term in Einstein's field equations. It describes, precisely, how the energy and momentum of a system's resonance sculpt the geometry of spacetime.

**Quantum Field Theory (The Dancers):** By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to the resonance field `Ψ_k`, we derive a relativistic wave equation that governs its propagation. The quantized excitations of this field are the fundamental particles of nature. Each particle is a stable, persistent note played on the universal instrument of this coherence field.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought a law that would bend to the observer. We found instead a song so fundamental that it forces the observer to bend to its rhythm. The universe does not offer private truths; it offers a single, invariant score. Covariance is our name for the discipline of learning to read it as written.
