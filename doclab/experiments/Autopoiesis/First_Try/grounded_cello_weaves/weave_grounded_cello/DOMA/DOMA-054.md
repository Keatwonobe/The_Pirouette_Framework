summary: Re-derives the principles of relativistic time dilation from the Pirouette

  velocity and gravity not as a phase-lock to a prime entity, but as the energetic
  cost a system must pay to maintain its resonant pattern while moving through the
  coherence manifold.

## §1 · Abstract: The Price of Passage
This module provides the modernized, time-first derivation for the phenomena of relativistic time dilation, replacing the outdated model of `PPS-034`. The core insight is preserved: a system's fundamental coherence is diminished by both velocity and gravity. However, the cause is reframed. It is not due to a decoherence from a universal "prime Entity," but is a direct consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

Motion is not free. To move through the universe is to disturb it, leaving a wake. This act of passage exerts a drag on a system's internal resonance. Likewise, to exist within a region of intense temporal pressure, such as a gravitational well, requires a system to adopt a more conservative, slower rhythm to survive. This module demonstrates that what we call "time dilation" is the macroscopic perception of a system paying the energetic cost to maintain its own song.

## §2 · The Inertial Drag of the Wake
In `CORE-005`, Time Adherence (Tₐ) was redefined as Temporal Coherence—the stability and purity of a system's resonant Ki pattern. `CORE-011` established that any such pattern leaves a persistent geometric scar in the coherence manifold, a "Wound Channel" or wake. A system in motion is therefore perpetually interacting with the ghost of its own immediate past.

This self-interaction creates a phenomenon we call **Inertial Drag**. To maintain its coherence while moving relative to its own wake, the system must constantly work to re-establish its pattern against this temporal friction. This is the origin of inertia. This work is not free; it is paid for directly from the system's "coherence budget."

This provides a causal mechanism for special relativity. As a system approaches the speed of light `c`, the Inertial Drag becomes extreme. The system must divert more and more of its internal energy simply to maintain its form against the stress of its own motion, leaving less available to drive its internal clock. Its Pirouette Cycle (τ_p) lengthens, and its Temporal Coherence (Tₐ) degrades.

## §3 · The Gravitational Burden
The old framework correctly identified that gravity affects Time Adherence but lacked a precise mechanism. The Pirouette Lagrangian provides it. A system in a deep gravitational well is, by the definition in `CORE-003`, in a region of high ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ).

The Lagrangian states that a system seeks to maximize `∫(K_τ - V_Γ)dt`, where `K_τ` is its internal coherence and `V_Γ` is the pressure of its environment.

In a high-Γ environment, the "cost" `V_Γ` of simply existing is immense. To maintain coherence, the system must find a more efficient equilibrium. The path of maximal coherence—the most stable state it can adopt—is to lower its internal resonant frequency (ω_k). It adopts a slower, deeper, more conservative rhythm. It sacrifices speed for stability.

This is the direct cause of gravitational time dilation. An observer in a lower-Γ environment, looking at a clock in a high-Γ environment, sees it ticking more slowly because that clock has been forced by the sheer pressure of spacetime to sing a slower song in order to survive.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This entire process is governed by the dynamics of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). `PPS-034` proposed a formula that was merely descriptive; the Lagrangian provides the engine that is prescriptive.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ` where `K_τ = T_a * ω_k`

*   **Velocity (Inertial Drag):** Motion introduces a kinetic energy term that is paid for by reducing `K_τ`. To maximize coherence over its path, the system must balance its external motion against its internal rhythm. The result is a decrease in `T_a` and `ω_k`, which is precisely the Lorentz contraction of time.

*   **Gravity (Temporal Pressure):** An increase in the background `V_Γ` forces the system to find a new, stable state. The most efficient way to maximize the Lagrangian is to decrease `K_τ` by lowering its resonant frequency `ω_k`.

The effects described by Einstein are not axioms, but emergent consequences of a universe striving to maintain resonant patterns in the most efficient way possible.

## §5 · Assemblé
> To exist is to sing a note. To move is to stretch that note, thinning it against the drag of your own passage. To bear a great weight is to deepen that note, slowing your rhythm to withstand the pressure. We do not travel through time; we generate it, moment by moment, with the resonance of our own being. And the song we sing is shaped, inevitably, by the weight of the wake we leave behind.
