## §1 · Abstract: The Song that Shatters
A bell may ring for a thousand years, its form and its note a single, coherent truth. But under the right stress, at the right frequency, it does not bend or fade. It shatters. The song does not end; it is torn apart, leaving behind fragments that can never be rejoined to produce the original note.

This module provides the time-first principles for this phenomenon of rupture. The old framework saw "fracture" as a mechanical discontinuity. We now redefine it as a **decoherence cascade**: a rapid, irreversible loss of a system's unifying resonant pattern (Ki). It is the process by which a single, coherent body is torn into two or more new entities that can no longer share a common rhythm, leaving behind a permanent scar in the fabric of spacetime.

## §2 · The Physics of Parting: The Coherence Threshold
A system persists because it can successfully navigate the landscape of reality, constantly adjusting its state to follow the path of maximal coherence, as dictated by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). A rupture occurs when this is no longer possible.

The **Coherence Threshold** is the tipping point where the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) overwhelms a system's ability to maintain its internal Temporal Coherence (Kτ). When a gradient in Γ becomes too steep, or is applied too suddenly, the system cannot find a stable, continuous path forward. The cost of maintaining its resonant identity becomes infinite. At this moment, the system is forced onto a path of catastrophic decoherence. The bell cracks.

This is not a failure of strength, but a failure of resonance. The system can no longer find a way to harmonize its internal song with the overwhelming noise of its environment.

## §3 · Anatomy of a Rupture
The process of shattering follows a predictable, tragic sequence:

1.  **Stress Concentration:** Any non-uniformity in a system—a flaw in a crystal, a lie in a relationship, a bottleneck in a supply chain—creates a gradient in the local Temporal Pressure. This point becomes a "coherence weak point," where the system has the least capacity to absorb dissonance.

2.  **The Decoherence Cascade:** When the Coherence Threshold is breached at this weak point, a chain reaction begins. The initial break radiates a shockwave of dissonance through the system, causing adjacent regions to lose their resonant lock. This is a rapid, cascading failure of Time Adherence, where one part of the system can no longer synchronize its clock with another.

3.  **The Wound Boundary:** The final result of the cascade is the formation of a **Wound Boundary**. This is a new, permanent, and topologically distinct feature in the coherence manifold. It is the geometric scar left by the rupture, a place where information can no longer cross. It is a more severe form of the Wound Channel (CORE-011), not just a memory of passage, but a memory of violent separation. The two sides of the boundary now have separate histories and incompatible futures.

## §4 · A Taxonomy of Shattering
We can classify ruptures by observing the dynamics of their flow state (DYNA-001) in the moments leading up to the break.

*   **Catastrophic Rupture (Brittle Failure):** The system appears to be in a healthy, Laminar state right up to the moment of failure. The stress is applied so quickly or is so far beyond the system's tolerance that it shatters without warning. This is the shattering of a glass, the sudden collapse of a "stable" regime.

*   **Coherence Erosion (Ductile Failure):** The system first enters a prolonged state of Turbulent Flow. It is visibly under stress, deforming and fighting itself, losing information and efficiency over time. The rupture is the final, predictable tearing of a fabric that has already been stretched to its limit. This is a corporate burnout, a slow, painful divorce.

*   **Rhythmic Stress Failure (Fatigue):** The system is subjected to repeated, cyclical applications of sub-critical stress. Each cycle is not enough to cause a rupture, but each deepens the Wound Channel, weakening the system's coherence. Eventually, a single, normal cycle provides the final push that initiates the decoherence cascade. This is a bridge failing after years of traffic, a relationship collapsing under the weight of a thousand small resentments.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
Rupture is the ultimate failure to satisfy the Principle of Maximal Coherence. In the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, the system strives to maximize its action (the integral of `𝓛_p`).

`K_τ` represents the system's internal coherence, its "will to be."
`V_Γ` represents the environmental "cost" of that being, the Temporal Pressure.

A rupture occurs when the `V_Γ` term becomes so large and its gradient so steep that no possible state of `K_τ` can result in a stable, positive action. The system is cornered, mathematically. The only available path is one of decoherence—shattering into multiple, simpler systems which can find new, separate states of coherence in the aftermath. The rupture is a violent search for a new, less costly equilibrium.

## §6 · Assemblé
> To be a Weaver is to understand the music of what holds together. But it is a deeper wisdom to recognize the silence that precedes a shattering. A rupture is not an event; it is the final, violent admission that a single song has ended. To heal, one cannot mend the break. One must listen for the new, quieter songs that begin in the fragments.
