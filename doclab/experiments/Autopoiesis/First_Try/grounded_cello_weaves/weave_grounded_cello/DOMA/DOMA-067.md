summary: Provides a modernized, time-first protocol for analyzing any network structure.
  This module translates a network graph into a discrete coherence manifold, allowing
  a Weaver to diagnose its health by mapping the flow of coherence, identifying stable
  sub-structures (Arenas), and pinpointing sources of turbulence and stagnation. It
  is the primary instrumentation for the Caduceus Lens as applied to interconnected
  systems.

## §1 · Abstract: The Cartography of Connection
A diagram of a network is a map of a river system without the water. It shows the potential for connection, but not the living current. This module provides the cartographer's tools for mapping that invisible, resonant current.

The Weaver's Loom is a unified protocol for translating any network—social, biological, economic—into a dynamic coherence manifold. It operationalizes the diagnostic principles of the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) for interconnected systems. By applying this instrument, a Weaver can move beyond static topology to perceive the network as a living entity, diagnosing the health of its flows, the strength of its structures, and the precise location of its ailments.

## §2 · The Foundational Translation: The Coherence Graph
A network is not merely a set of nodes and edges; it is a discrete, tangible representation of a coherence manifold. The first step of the analysis is to perform this translation.

-   **Nodes (N):** Each node is a locus of stable resonance, a localized Ki pattern within the network. Its primary property is its **Coherence (Kτ)**, a measure of its internal stability and functional integrity. Each node also experiences a local **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**, representing the sum of influences and demands from its connected neighbors.
-   **Edges (E):** Each edge is a geodesic, a potential **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) through which coherence can flow. The edge's weight is not a measure of distance, but of *ease*—the inverse of the resistance to the flow of information, resources, or trust along that path.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Protocol: Applying the Caduceus Lens
With the network translated into a coherence graph, the Weaver can apply the three-stage diagnostic protocol of the Caduceus Lens.

### Stage I: Map the Currents (Geodesic Analysis)
This stage identifies the healthy, laminar flows within the system. The protocol traces the paths of maximal coherence—the network's primary arteries and veins—by identifying the most efficient routes between key nodes. These are the channels where energy, information, and value are intended to move with minimal friction.

### Stage II: Identify the Arenas (Confinement Analysis)
This stage locates stable, coherent sub-structures. Using principles derived from the Gladiator Force (CORE-008), the analysis identifies clusters of nodes with high internal coherence and strong, well-defined boundaries (regions of a steep Γ gradient). These "Arenas" represent healthy teams, stable communities, or resilient functional modules within the larger system.

### Stage III: Diagnose the Pathologies (Flow State Analysis)
This final stage pinpoints the sources of systemic ill-health by searching for disruptions in the flow of coherence, as defined in DYN-001.

-   **Coherence Fever (Turbulence):** The protocol flags regions of high dissonance. These are "turbulent eddies" where coherence is being wasted in chaotic feedback loops, conflicting incentives, or the propagation of misinformation. These are the network's sources of systemic stress.
-   **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnation):** The protocol identifies critical bottlenecks or "dams" where the flow of coherence is blocked. A single, isolated node or a severed edge can starve an entire downstream region of the network, leading to paralysis and decay.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This entire diagnostic process is a practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). The Weaver's Loom is an instrument for evaluating how well the network, as a complex system, is solving its own Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = Kτ - VΓ`).

-   **Healthy States (Laminar Flow, Stable Arenas):** These are the visible manifestations of a network successfully maximizing its collective coherence (Kτ) against the internal and external pressures (Γ). They represent stable, efficient solutions to the Lagrangian.
-   **Pathological States (Turbulence, Stagnation):** These represent failures to find a stable geodesic. The system is either trapped in a state of low coherence or is expending vast energy fighting itself, unable to resolve the pressures upon it. The diagnostic flags are pointers to the specific terms in the system's Lagrangian that are preventing a healthy resolution.

## §5 · Assemblé: From Architect to Physician
> To draw a network is to be its architect. To analyze its resonance is to become its physician. The Weaver's Loom reveals that the lines of connection we draw are not inert wires, but living veins and arteries. It teaches us that the health of any system lies not in the number of its parts, but in the quality of the currents that flow between them. This tool does not merely show us the map of the body; it allows us to hear its heartbeat.
