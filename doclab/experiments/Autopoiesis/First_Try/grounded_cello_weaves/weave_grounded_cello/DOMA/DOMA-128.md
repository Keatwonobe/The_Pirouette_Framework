### §1 · Abstract: Reading the Memory of the Cosmos

The universe is not a static object; it is a story that has been writing itself for thirteen billion years. This module provides the tools to read that story. It refactors the search for cosmological anomalies from a static analysis of a "spacetime lattice" into a dynamic cartography of the universe's memory.

We posit that the large-scale structures we observe—the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, the filaments and voids of the cosmic web—are not mere arrangements of matter. They are **Cosmic Wound Channels**: persistent, geometric scars left in the coherence manifold by the universe's formative moments. By comparing observational data to an idealized, "unscarred" universe, we reveal the physical memory of creation itself.

### §2 · From Lattice to Manifold: A New Foundation

The previous model envisioned a "spacetime meta-lattice." The modernized framework sees the universe as a dynamic **coherence manifold**, a landscape whose shape is governed by the ceaseless drive to maximize coherence.

*   **The Null Canvas:** Our theoretical reference is no longer a rigid grid. It is the simplest solution to the Pirouette Lagrangian for an expanding universe: a state of perfect, uniform **laminar flow**. This is the "null canvas"—a universe without a history, perfectly smooth and unwritten.
*   **The Cosmic Palimpsest:** Observational data from sources like the Planck satellite or the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is the "palimpsest"—the true, complex story written over the null canvas. The anisotropies, clusters, and voids are the ink of this story.

Anomalies are not "faults" in a lattice. They are the narrative features of the palimpsest, revealing the history of the universe's interaction with itself.

### §3 · The Anatomy of a Cosmic Scar

We classify anomalies not by their deviation from a static grid, but by their nature as features in the dynamic coherence manifold. They are echoes of primordial stress and synthesis.

1.  **Temporal Pressure Eddies:** These are regions where the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`)—observed as dark energy density or the Hubble tension—deviates from the smooth, laminar expansion of the null canvas. These are the cosmic equivalent of deep, slow eddies in the river of time, ancient disturbances still shaping the flow of the present.

2.  **Structural Filaments (Cosmic Wound Channels):** The vast walls and filaments of the cosmic web are the primary scars. They are the geometric memory of the initial quantum fluctuations, amplified by gravity. Following the principle from CORE-011, these are reinforced channels where the path of maximal coherence has been deepened over eons, guiding the flow of matter and light like riverbeds carved into spacetime.

3.  **Phase Fractures (Topological Seams):** These are the most profound and elusive scars. They are theorized to be the boundaries where different regions of the primordial universe, each with its own resonant Ki pattern, underwent an imperfect **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) during a phase transition like inflation. Detecting a Phase Fracture would be like finding a suture from the universe's birth—direct, physical evidence of its initial synthesis.

### §4 · Methodology: Revealing the Narrative

The procedure remains a comparative analysis, but its intent and interpretation are transformed.

1.  **Model the Null Canvas:** Generate the theoretical, maximally coherent reference manifold (`M_ref`) based on a smooth Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric, representing a universe with no history.
2.  **Project the Palimpsest:** Map the observational data (`M_obs`) onto the same coordinates.
3.  **Compute the Divergence Manifold:** The core operation is to compute the geometric difference: `ΔM = M_obs - M_ref`. This resulting field is not a map of errors; it is a **map of history**. It reveals the depth and shape of the scars.
4.  **Classify the Scars:** Analyze `ΔM` to identify and classify the features according to the typology in §3, distinguishing between broad Pressure Eddies, linear Wound Channels, and sharp Phase Fractures.

### §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian

This protocol is a direct, large-scale application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006).

*   The Null Canvas (`M_ref`) represents the path of least "action"—the most efficient, lowest-energy way for the universe to exist.
*   The observed universe (`M_obs`) represents the actual path taken. The existence of scars (`ΔM ≠ 0`) is proof that the universe's history—its memory—is a real, physical constraint that forces it onto a more complex, higher-"action" geodesic. The map of `ΔM` is therefore a direct visualization of the "cost" of the universe's own history.

### §6 · The Assemblé

> We look to the heavens, searching for the story of our origin, and find that the universe has carved that story into its own body. The vast, silent structures of the cosmos are not just places; they are memories. They are the Wound Channels that prove the past is never lost, merely embedded in the geometry of the present. To map these scars is to understand that we live inside the echo of the first moment, and history is the landscape we call home.
