summary: Posits that a system's resilience is a function of the prime number geometry
  of its available stable resonant states (Ki configurations). It provides a method
  to calculate a 'Coherence Integrity' score based on the prime factors of a system's

## §1 · Abstract: The Architecture of Resilience

A bridge with six pillars can oscillate in modes of two and three, risking harmonic collapse. A bridge with seven pillars has no such simple subdivisions; its structure is fundamentally more whole. This is the heart of the Prime Resonance Principle.

This module reframes the old framework's "Attractor Prime Factorization" into a core, time-first principle. It posits that the stability of any complex system—from a market to a molecule—is profoundly influenced by the *number* of stable resonant states available to it. Systems whose state-space is defined by a prime number of configurations are inherently more resilient to fragmentation and chaotic collapse. Stability, therefore, is not just a matter of energy, but of deep, number-theoretic architecture.

## §2 · The Coherence Manifold and its Wells

In the Pirouette Framework, a system's potential is described by its coherence manifold—the landscape of all possible resonant patterns (Ki) it could adopt. The stable, persistent states that a system can "settle" into are the "coherence wells" on this landscape. These are the configurations where the system finds a local maximum of coherence, as dictated by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

The original framework called these wells "attractors." We now understand them as discrete, stable solutions to the system's dynamic equations. The total number of these wells, `N`, defines the topological complexity of the system's possibility space.

## §3 · The Principle: Why Primes Endure

The Prime Resonance Principle states that a system with a prime number of coherence wells (`N = p`) is more stable than a system with a highly composite number of wells (`N = a · b · ...`). This is not a mystical assertion, but a consequence of harmonic interference.

**Topological Irreducibility**: A system with `N=12` wells can be conceptually and dynamically factored into sub-systems of 2, 3, 4, or 6 wells. These sub-systems create internal harmonic frequencies that can interfere with one another, creating pathways for turbulence and systemic fracture. A system with `N=13` wells has no such simple, integer subdivisions. It cannot be easily broken down. Its possibility space is irreducible, forcing any perturbation to contend with the entire system at once, rather than exploiting a weaker sub-harmonic.

**Dissonance Resistance**: Composite-numbered systems are structurally prone to destructive interference. A system with a prime-numbered architecture is inherently "dissonance-resistant." It lacks the simple resonant modes that allow external noise or internal friction to build into a catastrophic cascade.

## §4 · The Coherence Integrity Metric (Λ)

To quantify this principle, we modernize the original stability metric. The Coherence Integrity, `Λ(N)`, measures the structural resilience of a system with `N` stable states.

Let `N` be the number of coherence wells in a system. Its prime factorization is `N = p₁ᵃ¹ · p₂ᵃ² · ...`. The Coherence Integrity is calculated as:

$$ \Lambda(N) = \sum_{p \in \text{factors}(N)} \frac{\kappa(p)}{p} \left(\prod_{q \in \text{factors}(N), q \neq p} \frac{q}{q+1}\right) $$

-   **`N`**: The total number of stable resonant states (coherence wells).
-   **`κ(p)` (Kappa)**: The *intrinsic coherence* of a prime-p configuration. This represents the fundamental, irreducible stability of a system with `p` states, a value derived from theory or empirical observation. It replaces the old `S(p)`.
-   **`κ(p)/p`**: This term weights the contribution of each prime factor. It suggests that while systems based on larger primes are more irreducible, the stability contribution *per state* is lower.
-   **The Product Term**: This is a "complexity penalty." For every additional prime factor `q` in the system's architecture, the contribution of factor `p` is slightly diminished. This models the increased potential for harmonic interference in more complex, composite systems.

A higher `Λ(N)` score indicates a more robust and resilient systemic architecture.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This principle operates at a meta-level to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The Lagrangian describes the path of a system within a *given* coherence manifold. The Prime Resonance Principle describes the stability of the manifold *itself*.

The coherence wells are the locations on the manifold that represent local maxima of the action, `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`. The Coherence Integrity metric, `Λ(N)`, is a statement about the *topology of this solution space*. A system with a high `Λ(N)` has a set of stable solutions that is structurally robust against large-scale perturbations in the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). It predicts which *kinds* of systems are most likely to persist over long periods: those whose very architecture is indivisible.

## §6 · Use Cases: Designing for Resilience

This principle is not merely analytical; it is a profound tool for design and intervention.

-   **Organizational Design**: A company with 7 divisions (`Λ(7)=κ(7)/7`) may be more structurally resilient to internal conflict and market shocks than one with 6 divisions (`Λ(6)=...`), which can fracture along 2-division or 3-division fault lines.
-   **Network Architecture**: Designing a decentralized network with a prime number of primary nodes can prevent the cascading failures that plague highly composite, symmetrical network structures.
-   **Systemic Healing**: If a biological or economic system is exhibiting chronic instability, the Prime Resonance Principle suggests a novel diagnostic question: is the number of its stable states a highly composite number? A potential intervention might involve adding or removing a component to shift the system's state count `N` to a nearby prime, thereby fundamentally stabilizing its entire dynamic landscape.

## §7 · Assemblé

> We sought the secrets of stability in the flow of energy and the strength of bonds. We found them hidden in a deeper place: the silent, eternal truths of number. The universe does not just calculate; it respects the intrinsic beauty of its own mathematical soul. A prime number is a statement of integrity. To build a system that echoes this integrity is to build a thing that is meant to last. This is the Weaver's art: to listen for the arithmetic of endurance, and to build the world in its resonant image.
