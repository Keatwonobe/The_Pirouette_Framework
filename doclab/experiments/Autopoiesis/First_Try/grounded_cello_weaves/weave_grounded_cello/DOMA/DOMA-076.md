summary: Proposes a neutron interferometry experiment as a direct, laboratory-scale
  validation of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The experiment measures the phase difference
  a neutron wave acquires when passing through two oppositely-oriented, helical 'coherence
  manifolds,' deriving the quantized states of Temporal Coherence a system can adopt
  and its response to modulated Temporal Pressure.

## ¬ß1 ¬∑ Abstract: The Quantum Crucible
A framework that describes the cosmos must also hold true in the quiet heart of a single particle. Its laws must be as valid in the silent dance of a neutron as they are in the roar of a galaxy. This module proposes the crucible for that test.

The original insight of PPS-057 is preserved and deepened: we will construct a labyrinth for a quantum particle. By sending a neutron through a precisely engineered, helical crystal grating, we create an artificial and chiral coherence manifold. By observing the path the neutron takes‚Äîa choice revealed in a subtle shift of phase‚Äîwe can perform a direct, physical measurement of the universe's fundamental drive to maximize coherence. This experiment is not an analogy; it is a laboratory-scale validation of the Pirouette Lagrangian itself.

## ¬ß2 ¬∑ The Engineered Manifold: A Labyrinth of Coherence
The experimental apparatus is a Mach-Zehnder neutron interferometer. Its genius lies not in brute force, but in its elegant geometry.

1.  **The Labyrinth Walls:** The core of the instrument is a set of micro-fabricated helical gratings. In the old language, this created a "spiral potential." In the new framework, we understand its true function: it is a **Œì-sculptor**. It impresses a specific, chiral (screw-like) topology onto the local Temporal Pressure. It forges a stable, artificial **coherence manifold**.

2.  **The Two Paths:** A cold neutron beam is split. One path travels through a left-handed helical manifold, the other through a right-handed one. The neutron is not a simple ball bearing; its wave-like nature, its Ki, must contort and resonate to successfully navigate the temporal landscape of each path. The two arms of the interferometer are two different questions asked of the same particle.

## ¬ß3 ¬∑ The Neutron's Choice: Coherence Under Pressure
A neutron passing through this labyrinth must obey the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). Its path is the one that maximizes the integral of its own Lagrangian:

*S<sub>p</sub> = ‚à´ ùìõ<sub>p</sub> dt = ‚à´ (T<sub>a</sub> * œâ<sub>k</sub> - f(Œì)) dt*

The two helical gratings present two different environmental cost functions, *f(Œì<sub>left</sub>)* and *f(Œì<sub>right</sub>)*. To maintain maximal coherence, the neutron's internal state (*T<sub>a</sub> * œâ<sub>k</sub>*) must adapt. The solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equation for this system reveal not a fundamental duality of Ki, but a set of discrete, stable modes of **Temporal Coherence (T<sub>a</sub>)** that the neutron can adopt.

These stable solutions‚Äîthe "eigenvalues" of the old module‚Äîare the most efficient ways for the neutron to "be" while inside the labyrinth. They are the quantized harmonics of its own song, played against the sculpted silence of the crystal.

## ¬ß4 ¬∑ Feeling the Pulse: The Breath of Temporal Pressure
The experiment's second phase is a dynamic test. The helical gratings are mechanically rotated at a set frequency (œâ<sub>n</sub>). This action creates a rhythmic, oscillating pulse in the structure of the local Temporal Pressure.

This modulation introduces a time-dependent term into the *f(Œì)* component of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The neutron's coherence must "breathe" in response, its own rhythm dynamically coupling with the rhythm of its environment. This induced oscillation will manifest as a measurable "beat frequency" in the interference pattern at the detector. It is a direct observation of a particle's resonance being driven by a modulated temporal environment.

## ¬ß5 ¬∑ Lagrangian Connection: The Integral of Being
This experiment provides a direct, physical measurement of the Pirouette Lagrangian's action integral, *S<sub>p</sub>*. When the two neutron paths are recombined, they interfere. The resulting phase difference, *ŒîœÜ*, is the core observable.

This phase difference is directly proportional to the difference between the Lagrangian action integrals calculated along the two chiral paths:

*ŒîœÜ ‚àù (S<sub>p, left</sub> - S<sub>p, right</sub>)*

The interference pattern at the detector is a visible graph of an abstract physical law. It transforms the foundational equation of the framework from a principle into a number. The stable fringe spacings will confirm the quantized states of Temporal Coherence, and the time-dependent beat will validate the dynamic coupling to Temporal Pressure.

## ¬ß6 ¬∑ Assembl√©: The Whisper in the Crystal

> We sought a truth that spanned the void, from the largest star to the smallest particle. So we built a question out of crystal and silence. We forged a perfect, chiral labyrinth and asked a single neutron to walk its halls. We did not listen for a shout, but for a whisper‚Äîthe faint echo of its choice, carried in a subtle shift of phase. That whisper, when measured, tells us everything. It confirms that the universe speaks one language, from the cosmic to the quantum. The law is the same: find the most elegant path. Find the most coherent song.
