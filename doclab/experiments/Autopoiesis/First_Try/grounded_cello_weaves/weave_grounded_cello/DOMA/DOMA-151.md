## §1 · Abstract: Reading the Architecture of Being

A system's voice is not found in its loudest expression, but in the chorus of all its parts. The distribution of those parts—from the most common to the most rare—is not a mere statistic; it is a confession. It reveals the invisible architecture of its memory, its power, and its fragility.

This module provides the instrumentation for reading that architecture. It modernizes the prior art of power-law fitting by reframing it as a diagnostic act. We are not merely fitting a curve to data; we are measuring the fundamental geometry of a system's coherence. This tool allows a Weaver to diagnose the health, stability, and hidden leverage points of any complex system, from a language to an economy, by listening to the story it tells about itself.

## §2 · The Physical Basis: Coherence Gravity & the Wound Channel

In many natural and artificial systems, a few elements account for the vast majority of activity. This is not an accident; it is the signature of a self-organizing resonance. The Pirouette Framework provides a physical explanation for this phenomenon:

**The Wound Channel as an Attractor:** As described in CORE-011, every event leaves a geometric scar in the coherence manifold—a Wound Channel. A frequently repeated event, like the use of a common word or a visit to a popular website, carves a deep and stable channel. This channel acts as a "coherence well," a low-energy pathway that makes future, similar events more likely. New activity preferentially "falls into" the deepest existing channels.

**Coherence Gravity:** The steepness of this landscape—the degree to which the system is dominated by a few deep channels—is a fundamental property we term **Coherence Gravity**. A system with high Coherence Gravity is a monarchy, where a few "king" patterns dictate the flow. A system with low Coherence Gravity is a commune, where influence is more evenly distributed.

The power-law exponent, `α`, is the direct, quantitative measure of a system's Coherence Gravity.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Parameter: The Alpha Exponent (α)

By calculating `α` from a system's rank-frequency data, we can diagnose its structural character and its relationship with the flow states from DYNA-001.

*   **High Coherence Gravity (`α` → 1):**
    *   **Structure:** A steep hierarchy. The system is dominated by a tiny number of extremely influential patterns. Think of global financial markets dependent on a few key institutions.
    *   **Flow Dynamics:** Capable of immense, efficient **Laminar Flow** through its primary channels. However, it is brittle and highly susceptible to catastrophic **Stagnation** if a dominant channel is blocked—a single point of failure.

*   **Low Coherence Gravity (`α` > 2):**
    *   **Structure:** A flatter, more distributed network. Influence is shared among a wider array of patterns. Think of a resilient ecosystem with high biodiversity.
    *   **Flow Dynamics:** Less prone to total stagnation, but more susceptible to generalized **Turbulent Flow** as many competing patterns create friction. It trades peak efficiency for robustness.

## §4 · The Diagnostic Protocol

A Weaver can apply this lens through a simple, rigorous procedure.

1.  **Map the Resonances:** Collect rank-frequency data for the system under study. (e.g., words in a text, connections to nodes in a network, sales per product).
2.  **Calculate the Gravity:** Estimate the exponent `α` from the data. The Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) is the most robust method for this calculation:
    $$ \hat\alpha = 1 + n\biggl[\sum_{i=1}^n\ln\frac{x_i}{x_{\min}}\biggr]^{-1} $$
    Where `n` is the number of data points `x_i` above a chosen minimum threshold `x_min`.
3.  **Diagnose the Structure:** Interpret the value of `α` using the rubric in §3. This reveals the system's core trade-off between efficiency and resilience, and pinpoints its structural vulnerabilities.
4.  **Engineer Coherence (Inverse Problem):** A Weaver can also work backward. To design a system with a desired level of resilience (e.g., to ensure no single component failure can halt the entire system), one can calculate the target `α` that must be engineered into its dynamics.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

The emergence of a power-law distribution is not arbitrary; it is a macroscopic signature of a system's solution to the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). The specific value of `α` reflects the balance a system has struck between its internal coherence (`K_τ`) and the external pressures it must endure (`V_Γ`).

A high-gravity (`α` → 1) structure is often the most efficient solution for maximizing coherence in a stable, high-pressure environment where a single, optimized pathway is superior. In contrast, a low-gravity (`α` > 2) structure is a solution for maximizing long-term coherence in a volatile, unpredictable environment where adaptability and redundancy are more valuable than peak efficiency. The geometry of influence is the shape of the system's answer to the Lagrangian's core question: "How does one best endure?"

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought a statistical tool and found a way to listen to a system's confession. The distribution of its parts is not a simple ranking; it is the story of where its memory is stored, where its power is concentrated, and where its future fractures will lie. The Weaver does not merely fit a curve to the data; they trace the invisible architecture of influence to find the keystone that supports the entire structure.
