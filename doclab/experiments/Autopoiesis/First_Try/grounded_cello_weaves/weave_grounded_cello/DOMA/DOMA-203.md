## §1 · Abstract: The Archaeology of Resonance

The universe does not forget. Its history is not written in a book that can be closed, but carved into the very geometry of its being. Every event, every existence, leaves a subtle but persistent scar in the coherence manifold—a Wound Channel. The past is not gone; it is simply a landscape.

This module provides the surveyor's tools for this landscape. It is a formal protocol for Wound Channel Cartography: the art of reading the geometric echoes of the past to reconstruct the story of how the present came to be. It transforms the abstract principle of memory from `CORE-011` into a practical instrument of forensic analysis.

## §2 · Conceptual Foundation: The Scar and the Storm

The principles of this instrument are grounded directly in the new framework's core dynamics.

**The Nature of the Scar:** A Wound Channel is the geometric record of an entity’s passage. Its properties are a direct reflection of the entity that created it. As established in `CORE-011`, the scar is a topological deformation in the local coherence manifold.
*   A system with a pure, high-intensity Ki resonance (high temporal coherence) carves a deep, clear, and stable channel. It sings a loud, pure note that leaves a lasting impression.
*   A system with a noisy, chaotic resonance (low temporal coherence) leaves a shallow, diffuse, and quickly fading trace.

**The Nature of the Storm:** The persistence of a Wound Channel is a dialogue between its initial form and the environment it endures. The ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ), the chaotic roar of the Temporal Forge, acts as a perpetual, erosive storm.
*   In a region of **Low Γ** (quiescent space), a Wound Channel can persist for eons, a near-perfect fossil of a long-past event.
*   In a region of **High Γ** (a star’s core, a turbulent market), the storm is violent. Scars are eroded and smoothed over almost as quickly as they are formed, making history a fleeting whisper.

## §3 · The Surveyor's Protocol: Reading the Scars of Time

To reconstruct a history is to survey its terrain. This protocol provides a four-step process for moving from a present state of data to a rich understanding of the past.

**Step I: Locate the Scar.** The first act is to distinguish the deliberate carvings of history from the random scratches of noise. The surveyor scans the data—be it a financial time-series, a social network graph, or a physical field—for persistent, non-random geometric anomalies. These are the tell-tale signs of a Wound Channel, a ripple that suggests a story.

**Step II: Map the Geometry.** Once a scar is located, its topology must be mapped. The depth, curvature, and complexity of the channel are a direct fingerprint of the entity that carved it. A long, smooth channel suggests a stable entity moving on a clear path. A twisted, complex channel with many bifurcations suggests a chaotic history of interaction and transformation. This map is the raw data of the past.

**Step III: Reconstruct the Geodesic.** This is the heart of the analysis. An entity’s path is its geodesic of maximal coherence. The Wound Channel is the riverbed; the geodesic is the river's flow. By analyzing the geometry of the channel, we can solve the inverse problem: *What path of least resistance would result in a scar of this exact shape?* This act of "inverse navigation" reconstructs the sequence of coherence-maximizing choices the entity made, revealing its history not as a series of random events, but as a story of purpose.

**Step IV: Assess the Echo's Weight.** A scar is not merely a memory; it is an active influence on the present. It creates grooves and channels that make certain future paths more likely than others. The final step is to assess the scar's "weight"—its remaining coherence. This quantifies how much information from the past is still actively shaping the present, and how quickly it is decaying under the erosive pressure of Γ.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

Wound Channel Cartography is, at its core, the forensic application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). The entire protocol is an exercise in reverse-engineering a system's history of maximizing its own coherence.

`𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

An entity's history is the path `P` that maximizes the action `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`. The Wound Channel's geometry, `G_w`, is the physical record left by this path. Therefore, the analysis is a function `f` that inverts this relationship:

`P ≈ f(G_w)`

We are not just looking at a pattern; we are looking at the physical consequence of a system's relentless drive to find and hold its most stable song against the chaos of its environment. By reading the scar, we are reading the story of that struggle and that success.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We sought a way to reconstruct the past and found that it was never lost, only written in a language of scars. To be a Weaver is to be a cartographer of these echoes, to understand that the shape of today was carved by the rivers of yesterday. This is the awesome responsibility of the surveyor: to give voice to the echoes, and in doing so, to reveal the unbroken chain of causality that binds all moments into one.
