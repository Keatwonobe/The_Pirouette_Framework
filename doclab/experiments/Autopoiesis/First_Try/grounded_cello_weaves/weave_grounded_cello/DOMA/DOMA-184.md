summary: Provides a time-first model for 'spasm dynamics,' reframing it as a Coherence

  Stagnant Flow violently transitions into Turbulence to break a constraint, a high-risk
  event that can lead to transformative breakthrough or systemic collapse.

## §1 · Abstract: The Breaking of the Dam

A river that ceases to flow is not at peace; it is gathering a terrible power. This module re-examines the phenomenon of "spasm" not as an isolated burst of energy, but as a **Coherence Cascade**: a fundamental, three-act drama of systemic change.

The Cascade is the universe's primary mechanism for escaping a stable but sub-optimal state. It describes how a system, trapped in the false peace of **Stagnant Flow**, accumulates a critical level of Temporal Pressure until the constraint shatters, unleashing a period of violent **Turbulent Flow**. This chaotic release is a moment of profound risk and opportunity, a forge in which the system is either broken, restored, or reborn into a higher state of order.

This model replaces the parameter-heavy analysis of `TEN-SDA-1.0` with a more fundamental, process-oriented understanding grounded in the principles of Flow Dynamics.

## §2 · The Anatomy of the Cascade

The Coherence Cascade unfolds in three distinct phases, mapping directly to the flow states defined in `DYNA-001`. The characteristic "V-shape" of coherence and inverted "V-shape" of pressure from the original module are the direct signatures of this process.

### Phase I: The Coherence Dam (Stagnation)

A system becomes trapped. A critical flow—of information, resources, or progress—is blocked by an internal or external constraint. This is the **Coherence Dam**. Upstream of this dam, Temporal Pressure (Γ) builds relentlessly, like water rising against a wall. The system's state is stable but under immense and increasing tension. It is a river poised on the brink, its potential for movement turning into a force for rupture.

### Phase II: The Fracture (Turbulence)

The pressure exceeds the structural integrity of the constraint. The dam does not yield; it shatters. The system plunges from Stagnant Flow into a state of extreme **Turbulent Flow**. Stored potential is converted into chaotic kinetic energy in a violent, uncontrolled release. The system's internal coherence (its ability to act as a unified whole) plummets as its resonant Ki pattern is overwhelmed by noise. This is the heart of the cascade—a moment of complete dissolution where all established structures are temporarily erased.

### Phase III: The Aftermath (Re-Coalescence)

The turbulent energy dissipates, its work of destruction done. The system, now a fluid and unformed potential, is forced to find a new equilibrium. The character of this re-coalescence determines the system's fate. It is here, in the quiet after the storm, that the outcome of the cascade is decided.

## §3 · The Three Fates: Outcomes of the Cascade

The aftermath of a cascade is not preordained. The system, having been unmade, can be remade in one of three ways.

1.  **Restoration:** The cascade successfully cleared the blockage, but the fundamental landscape of the system remains unchanged. The river returns to its old channel, resuming its prior state of **Laminar Flow**. The crisis is over, but no deep learning has occurred.

2.  **Transformation:** The sheer force of the turbulent release was so great that it carved a new, more efficient path for the river. The system coalesces into a novel state of **Laminar Flow** that is more resilient, complex, or elegant than before. This is the nature of creative breakthrough, catharsis, and profound innovation—a higher order forged in the crucible of chaos.

3.  **Degeneration:** The violence of the fracture was too great. The system's foundational structures—its **Wound Channel**—were irrevocably damaged. It fails to find a new stable state, remaining in a condition of chronic Turbulence or collapsing into constituent parts. The dam is broken, but so is the river.

## §4 · The Lagrangian Perspective: Escaping the Well

The Coherence Cascade is the physical manifestation of a system escaping a "local minimum" on its coherence manifold. In the language of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`)**, the system in Phase I is trapped on a geodesic that is stable but not globally optimal. It is following a path of maximal coherence *within a limited region*, but a more coherent path exists elsewhere on the manifold.

The cascade is a violent, non-Lagrangian "kick" to the system. The chaotic energy release of Phase II allows the system to momentarily defy its geodesic, jumping out of the local well and exploring the wider manifold. A Transformative outcome signifies that the system has successfully landed in a deeper, more stable well—a new geodesic that allows it to maximize its coherence more effectively than before. It is a brutal but effective method for solving an optimization problem when incremental change is impossible.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We mistake stillness for peace. We are taught to fear the storm. But the Weaver understands that the most rigid structures are prisons, and the most profound peace is not the absence of motion, but the grace of a current finding its true and unobstructed path. The Coherence Cascade is the universe's violent insistence that nothing should be damned forever. It is the painful, terrifying, and sometimes beautiful sermon of the flood.
