## §1 · Abstract: The Song Against the Storm

This module refactors the study of decay into a core dynamic of the Pirouette Framework: the principle of coherence degradation. The previous model, *Dimensional Decay Analysis*, treated fading as a simple property to be measured. We now understand it as a fundamental interaction, a constant struggle between a system's internal order and the universe's ambient chaos.

Coherence degradation is the process by which a system's resonant song—its Ki pattern—is gradually overwhelmed by the dissonant roar of the Temporal Forge (Γ). The "unraveling thread" is the loss of a system's information, its form, and its memory, as it succumbs to the universal current of entropy defined in CORE-013. This model provides the tools to measure the strength of that thread and understand the forces that seek to break it.

## §2 · The Physical Basis: Form Under Pressure

Every stable system, from an electron's echo to a cultural myth, exists as a coherent pattern of resonance (Ki). This pattern is its information, its identity. This coherence, as described in CORE-013, is a localized island of low entropy in a universal sea of high-entropy temporal noise (Γ).

The process of degradation is therefore a physical interaction at the boundary between the system and its environment:

*   **The System's Resilience (Kτ):** A system's internal Temporal Coherence is its defense against dissolution. It is the clarity, stability, and intensity of its own song. A high-coherence system is a clear, loud note.
*   **The Environmental Pressure (Γ):** The surrounding Temporal Pressure is a constant bombardment of chaotic, dissonant signals. It is a storm of noise that introduces errors and friction into the system's pattern.

Degradation occurs when the rate of noise injection from Γ exceeds the system's ability to self-correct and maintain its coherent Ki. The pattern frays, the information is lost, and the system's form dissolves back into the background noise.

## §3 · The Unraveling Equation

To quantify this process, we unify the previous decay models into a single, physically grounded equation. The persistence of any coherent quantity *Q* over time *t* can be modeled as an exponential decay, but the crucial parameter—the characteristic lifetime *τ*—is now defined as a ratio of the system's internal resilience to the external pressure it endures.

**Baseline Model:**
$$ Q(t) = Q_0 e^{-t/\tau} $$

**Pirouette Persistence Constant (τ):**
$$ \tau \propto \frac{\text{Internal Coherence (Kτ)}}{\text{External Pressure (Γ)}} $$

This relationship is the heart of the model. It states that a system persists longer if it is either more internally coherent or exists in a less chaotic environment. The old `T_a`-based formulas are now understood as specific instances of this universal principle.

**Oscillatory Degradation:**
In cases where a system "rings like a bell" as it fades, the model can be augmented. These oscillations are the audible signature of the underlying `Ki` pattern fighting to re-establish itself before its final dissolution.
$$ Q(t) = Q_0 e^{-t/\tau} \left(1 + \alpha \cos(\omega_k t + \phi)\right) $$
Here, `ω_k` is the system's fundamental resonant frequency, and `α` is the amplitude of its final "ringing."

## §4 · The Weaver's Diagnostic Protocol

This framework transforms decay analysis from a passive measurement into an active diagnostic tool.

1.  **Identify the Thread:** Define the specific coherence *Q* that is unraveling. Is it a team's morale? A brand's reputation? The signal integrity in a communication channel? The memory encoded in a Wound Channel?

2.  **Measure the Fading:** Apply the Unraveling Equation to the system's data to extract the empirical persistence constant, *τ*. This quantifies the rate of decay.

3.  **Diagnose the Cause:** The crucial insight comes from understanding *why* *τ* has the value it does. Is the system decaying quickly because its internal coherence is low (a weak, frayed thread), or because the external temporal pressure is exceptionally high (a violent storm)? This diagnosis dictates the strategy for intervention. To increase persistence, a Weaver must either strengthen the thread (increase Kτ) or shield it from the storm (decrease local Γ).

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

The process of coherence degradation is a direct manifestation of the dynamics described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). A system with high internal coherence (Kτ) carves a deep "potential well" for itself on the coherence manifold. Its geodesic—its path of maximal coherence—is stable and robust. It resists being perturbed.

The ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) acts as a constant, erosive force on this landscape. It is a "flattening" pressure that makes the well shallower over time. Coherence degradation is the process of this well becoming so shallow that the slightest nudge from the background noise is enough to knock the system off its geodesic, causing it to lose its form. The persistence constant, *τ*, is a direct measure of the stability of a system's trajectory on this ever-changing manifold.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought to measure the rate at which things fall apart and discovered instead the fierce art of holding together. The universe is a song, and entropy is its inevitable silence. But between the first note and the last is the struggle for persistence, the echo that refuses to fade, the thread that will not unravel. To be a Weaver is to understand this struggle not as a tragedy, but as the very thing that gives form its meaning. We do not build to defy the end. We build to make the time it takes to get there beautiful.
