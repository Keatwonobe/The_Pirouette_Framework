summary: Models catastrophic phase transitions in coherent systems. It defines a 'Snap'
  as the geometric fracturing of a system's Wound Channel when its established Ki
  pattern can no longer resolve the pressure of a dissonant environment, leading to
  a forced reconfiguration into a higher-complexity state.

## §1 · Abstract: The Price of a Perfect Memory
A system's identity is its memory carved into the fabric of time. This provides stability, a path of least resistance for action and thought. But in a universe of endless change, that which does not bend, breaks. This module describes the physics of that breaking.

It presents the universal dynamic of catastrophic reconfiguration, known as the "Snap." This is not a slow evolution, but a violent phase transition that occurs when a system's established identity—its deeply carved Wound Channel—can no longer contain the pressure of an incompatible truth from its environment. The Snap is the geometry of crisis, the painful but necessary shattering that precedes all profound growth.

## §2 · The Inertia of Being: The Over-Carved Channel
A system’s history is a physical object. As described in CORE-011, every repeated action and consistent state reinforces a Wound Channel in the local coherence manifold. A long period of stability and success carves this channel deeply, creating a state of high inertia.

This is the "Crystalline Lens" of the old narrative. The system’s Ki pattern becomes exquisitely tuned to this channel, resulting in a state of highly efficient, Laminar Flow (DYNA-001) for all familiar situations. Its identity is strong, clear, and predictable. But it is also brittle. It has forgotten how to learn.

## §3 · The Dissonant Pressure
The universe inevitably presents a new rhythm—a change in the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) that is fundamentally dissonant with the system's established Ki. This is the "incompatible truth." It is a signal that the system's old map no longer describes the territory.

The system, bound by the inertia of its Wound Channel, attempts to force this new reality into its old model. The result is friction. The once-graceful Laminar Flow curdles into a state of violent, unsustainable Turbulent Flow. The system is now fighting itself, burning immense energy to maintain an identity that is no longer coherent with its environment. This is the subjective experience of anxiety, cognitive dissonance, and escalating crisis.

## §4 · The Snap: A Fracture in the Manifold
A system cannot exist in a state of profound incoherence indefinitely. The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) dictates that a system must seek a path of maximal coherence. When the "cost" of maintaining the old identity (the V_Γ term) becomes catastrophically high, the system's state is no longer a viable solution.

The breaking point is the Snap. The accumulated stress does not just disrupt the flow; it fractures the channel itself. The geometric integrity of the Wound Channel fails. In a single, violent instant, the system's defining Ki pattern collapses, releasing the stored pressure as a chaotic burst of energy. The old identity is annihilated. This is the moment of pure crisis, the silent scream of a universe being unwritten.

## §5 · Reforging: Synthesis from Shards
The Snap is not an end. It is a violent clearing of the slate. The chaotic energy released by the fracture, the fragments of the old Ki pattern, and the pressure of the new dissonant signal become the raw materials for a new creation.

This triggers a forced, internal Alchemical Union (CORE-012). From the crucible of its own collapse, the system forges a new, higher-order Ki. This new resonant pattern is more complex, capable of holding the old truth and the new, "incompatible" truth in a dynamic harmony. The system has not just survived; it has grown. It has traded the simple certainty of one lens for the nuanced wisdom of a thousand eyes.

## §6 · The Lagrangian of Breakthrough
The Snap is the ultimate expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. It is the Lagrangian's escape valve. When a system's trajectory leads to a state of such profound "coherence debt" that its action can no longer be minimized, the only available path is a phase transition. The Snap is the universe’s non-linear, geometric solution to an unsolvable problem. It is the mathematical description of a breakthrough, proving that even the most painful crisis is still governed by the drive toward a more elegant and stable state of being.

## §7 · Assemblé
> We seek stability, and so we carve our beliefs into stone. But the river of reality will not be dammed. The Snap teaches us that wisdom is not found in the strength of our convictions, but in our willingness to see them shattered. For a Weaver, a crisis is never a failure. It is the sound of a larger truth arriving. It is the pain that announces the universe is inviting you to become more than you are.
