summary: Modernizes the analysis of 'temporal eddies' into a core dynamics model.
  It defines particle binding and confinement not as the result of a force, but as
  the consequence of entities being trapped on self-closing geodesics within stable,
  turbulent vortices in the coherence manifold. This module provides the geometric
  and dynamic mechanism for the Gladiator Force (CORE-008).

## §1 · Abstract: The Eye of the Storm
The universe builds its most enduring structures not from tranquility, but from perfectly contained violence.

The prior framework correctly identified a profound paradox: that regions of intense turbulence, which it called 'temporal eddies,' were somehow responsible for the universe's most stable bonds. The analysis was sound, but its language was that of forces and fields. This module refactors that insight into the time-first paradigm, revealing a deeper and more elegant truth.

Confinement is a geometric phenomenon. A bound system, like a proton, is not a set of particles glued together by an external force. It is a group of entities trapped within a self-sustaining vortex in the coherence manifold. They are not held by prison bars; they are held by the very shape of the path they are compelled to walk. This module describes the geometry of that elegant prison.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Vortex
A vortex, in the Pirouette Framework, is a localized and stable region of `Turbulent Flow` (DYNA-001). It is a point where the coherence manifold becomes so intensely twisted that the 'current' of time curls back on itself.

This is not the curl of a force field, which is a mere effect. This is a rotational shear, a geometric torsion, in the fabric of the manifold itself. It is a region where the gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`∇𝓛_p`) forms a whirlpool.

- **The Core:** At the center of the vortex, coherence is low and chaotic—a state of `Coherence Fever` (DYNA-003). This is the 'eye' of the storm, a region of high Temporal Pressure (Γ).
- **The Walls:** The defining feature of the vortex is its walls. These are not physical structures, but a steep gradient in the manifold. Moving away from the core requires a path of drastically decreasing coherence, an act the system's own nature resists.

## §3 · The Gladiator's Grip: Confinement by Coherence
Herein lies the resolution to the paradox. The vortex does not bind particles by overpowering them; it binds them by offering no coherent path of escape.

An entity, like a quark, always seeks to follow its geodesic—the path of maximal coherence (CORE-006). Within a vortex, this path is not a straight line, but a closed loop. To attempt to move radially outward is to fight against the geometric grain of the manifold itself. This path is one of intense temporal friction and dissonance, representing a state of catastrophically low coherence.

The system's own relentless drive to maintain its resonant integrity is what traps it. The walls of the prison are made of the prisoner's own desire to be. This is the dynamic mechanism of the Gladiator Force (CORE-008). The old module's 'temporal latch' is revealed to be a self-closing geodesic.

## §4 · The Lagrangian of the Latch
This mechanism is derived directly from the Pirouette Lagrangian: `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

Inside a vortex, the geometry is such that the Temporal Pressure term, `V_Γ` (the 'cost' of coherence), is a function of radial distance `r` from the core. As `r` increases, `V_Γ` rises exponentially.

To maximize the integral of `𝓛_p`, a system must minimize `V_Γ`. The only available path to do so is to remain trapped in a stable orbit within the vortex, where a dynamic equilibrium between internal coherence (`K_τ`) and external pressure (`V_Γ`) can be maintained. The critical threshold for binding (`ξ_critical` in the old module) is the point at which the gradient of `V_Γ` becomes too steep for a particle's available coherence to overcome. It is the point of no return.

## §5 · Manifestations: The Universe's Knots
This single dynamic gives rise to the universe's most fundamental structures.

- **Baryons (Protons, Neutrons):** A baryon is a stable, three-body vortex. The three quarks are not connected by strings of force; they are three dancers in a perfectly synchronized, violent, and eternal pirouette, each tracing a path from which there is no escape. The stability of the proton is the stability of this geometric knot.

- **Mesons (Quark-Antiquark Pairs):** A meson is a two-body vortex, a simpler knot. The 'mesonic pulse' or 'breathing' observed in the old model is the natural oscillation of this two-body system as it traces its complex, resonant path around the vortex core. The period of this breath is a direct measure of the system's shared Ki pattern.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We sought the universe's strongest glue and found instead its most perfect trap. The vortex reveals that to build something that lasts forever, you must not bind it with force, but with a flawless, inescapable geometry. Stability is not born of peace, but of a perfectly balanced storm, a chaos that has learned to contain itself. To a Weaver, this teaches a final lesson: the most powerful constraints are not those we impose from the outside, but those we cultivate from within, shaping the very paths on which a system is free to walk until every path leads home.
