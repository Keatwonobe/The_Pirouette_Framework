## §1 · Abstract: Composing the Score of Being

A system does not possess a single rhythm; it is a symphony. The roar of an engine, the murmur of a market, the electrical storm of a living brain—these are not singular notes but the superposition of countless frequencies, a complex and often cacophonous song. To diagnose the health of the orchestra, one must be able to hear each instrument.

The Temporal Spectrograph is the instrument for this task. It is a formal protocol that takes the singular, undifferentiated signal of a system's behavior and decomposes it into a visual score. This "temporal spectrogram" maps the system's `Temporal Coherence` across the entire spectrum of its internal rhythms, revealing its dominant patterns, its hidden harmonies, and the precise moments where its music falters into noise. It transforms the act of analysis from listening to reading.

## §2 · Conceptual Foundation: From Signal to Signature

This instrument is grounded in the core principles of the time-first framework:

-   **The Temporal Signature (CORE-003):** Any system at any moment is defined by its `Temporal Signature`, the complete spectrum of interfering rhythms within its boundary. The raw data we collect from a system—a time-series, a log file, a stream of text—is a one-dimensional shadow of this rich, multi-dimensional signature.

-   **Coherence as Signal Purity (CORE-005):** `Temporal Coherence` (the successor to `Time Adherence`) is the measure of a rhythm's purity and stability. A high coherence value at a specific frequency means the system is successfully sustaining a clear, resonant `Ki` pattern—a stable note—at that tempo. Low coherence indicates noise and dissonance.

The Spectrograph, therefore, does not measure a new property. It applies a mathematical prism (like a wavelet transform) to the system's raw signal, separating its `Temporal Signature` into its constituent frequencies and measuring the `Temporal Coherence` of each one.

## §3 · The Protocol: Forging the Spectrogram

The creation of a temporal spectrogram is a three-step process that translates a raw data stream into an actionable diagnostic map.

1.  **Decomposition:** The input signal is processed using a multi-resolution analysis technique, typically a continuous wavelet transform. This acts as a tunable filter, decomposing the signal into a continuum of its constituent frequencies (ω). This step isolates each potential rhythm for individual analysis.

2.  **Coherence Calculation:** For each frequency (ω) and at each time point (t), the local `Temporal Coherence` is calculated. This is achieved by measuring the phase consistency of the signal within a local window at that specific frequency. The core equation remains:
    $$
    K_τ(t, ω) = \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j} e^{i\theta_j(t,ω)} \right|^2
    $$
    Where `θ` is the local phase of the signal at that time and frequency. This yields a precise measure of how "in tune" the system is with itself at every moment, for every possible rhythm.

3.  **Visualization:** The results are rendered as a 2D map, the temporal spectrogram. Time is plotted on the horizontal axis, frequency on the vertical axis, and the `Temporal Coherence` (`K_τ`) at each point is represented by color or intensity.

## §4 · Interpretation: Reading the Music

The spectrogram is a rich text that reveals the deep dynamics of a system's health, mapping directly to the states described in `DYNA-001: Flow Dynamics`.

-   **Bright, Stable Bands:** These are the system's dominant `Ki` patterns, its foundational notes. They indicate frequencies where the system maintains a healthy, stable resonance. This is the signature of **Laminar Flow**.

-   **Harmonic Echoes:** The presence of bright bands at integer multiples of a fundamental frequency (e.g., at ω, 2ω, 3ω) reveals a deeply stable and well-organized system. This is the structural harmony of a healthy entity.

-   **Sudden Broadband Collapse:** A sharp, vertical region where coherence drops across a wide range of frequencies is the definitive signature of a phase transition into **Turbulent Flow**. It is a "coherence fever," where the entire system descends into chaotic noise.

-   **Flickering or Fading Bands:** A primary `Ki` pattern that wavers in intensity or fades over time is a sign of instability or decay. This is the visual marker of `Coherence Erosion`, indicating the system is struggling to maintain its form against entropic pressure.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

The Temporal Spectrograph is a direct visualization of a system's attempt to solve the `Principle of Maximal Coherence` as defined by the `Pirouette Lagrangian` (CORE-006).

$$
\mathcal{L}_p = K_τ - V_Γ = (T_a \cdot \omega_k) - f(Γ)
$$

The bright, coherent bands on the spectrogram represent the specific frequencies (ω_k) where the system has found a stable solution that maximizes its `Temporal Coherence` term (`K_τ`) for the lowest "cost" against the ambient `Temporal Pressure` (`V_Γ`). The entire map, therefore, is a visual record of the system's ongoing optimization process. It shows us which rhythms are succeeding, which are failing, and how the system dynamically allocates its energy to maintain its being.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We were deafened by the roar of the system. This instrument is not an amplifier; it is a prism. It takes the singular, white noise of a complex reality and separates it into a spectrum of its constituent colors, its true notes. To be a Weaver is to read this music—to see which notes are pure, which are faltering, and to understand the chord that defines the soul of the machine.
