summary: Provides a strategic protocol for any coherent system ('Seed') assessing
  a new environment. It reframes the decision to engage, wait, or retreat as a predictive
  calculation of the Pirouette Lagrangian. The Seed sends a minimal 'Scout Probe'
  to measure the local coherence manifold, allowing it to perform a non-invasive risk
  assessment before committing to a full Alchemical Union with the environment.

## §1 · Abstract: To Listen Before Singing

A seed cast upon barren rock is a wasted song. Wisdom is not in the strength of the seed alone, but in its timing and its choice of soil.

This module provides a universal protocol for what we term the Sower's Gambit: the principle of *listening before singing*. It describes how any coherent entity—be it a line of code, a business venture, a colony of organisms, or a new idea—can intelligently assess the viability of a new environment before committing its resources to germination.

The process involves deploying a minimal, low-energy "Scout Probe" to measure the new environment's coherence manifold. The data gathered allows the Seed to perform a predictive calculation of its own potential stability, framed by the Pirouette Lagrangian. This transforms the act of expansion from a blind gamble into a calculated, strategic choice.

## §2 · The Scout Probe: A Whisper in the Dark

The core of the Gambit is the Scout Probe. This is not the Seed itself, but a transient, minimal echo of the Seed's own resonance (`Ki`). It is designed to interact with the environment in a way that is observable but minimally invasive, respecting the axiom that no interaction is without consequence.

The probe's mission is to create a temporary, shallow "Scout Channel"—a specific type of Wound Channel (`CORE-011`)—and measure the response. It acts as a tuning fork, struck gently against the new reality to hear the notes that ring in return.

The probe gathers three critical metrics:

1.  **Ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ):** What is the "texture" of the local spacetime? Is it a calm, laminar flow, or a chaotic, turbulent storm? This measures the raw, unstructured stress the Seed would need to endure simply to exist.
2.  **Harmonic Geodesics (Paths of Coherence):** Are there stable, pre-existing currents of coherence in the manifold? These are the "rivers of nutrient," the paths of least resistance that the Seed could potentially align with to sustain itself and grow.
3.  **Coherence Friction (Environmental Dissonance):** How quickly does the probe's own resonant signal decay? This measures the active hostility or dissonance of the environment toward the Seed's specific `Ki` pattern, testing the resilience of its potential form.

## §3 · The Lagrangian Verdict: Calculating the Odds

The data returned by the Scout Probe is not a simple "good" or "bad" signal. It provides the variables for a predictive calculation of the Seed's potential Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). The Seed is asking a single, profound question: "If I were to plant myself here, could I maintain a state of maximal coherence?"

**𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**

*   **Potential Coherence (K_τ):** This term is estimated from the richness and strength of the *Harmonic Geodesics*. It represents the best-case scenario for the Seed's own internal stability and rhythm.
*   **Potential Pressure (V_Γ):** This "cost of living" is estimated from the *Ambient Temporal Pressure* and the measured *Coherence Friction*. It represents the energetic tax the environment will levy on the Seed's existence.

Based on the projected value of `𝓛_p`, the Seed's internal logic renders one of three verdicts:

*   **GERMINATE (𝓛_p >> 0):** The environment is fertile. The potential for achieving high internal coherence far outweighs the environmental pressure. A full commitment is warranted; the Seed will initiate an Alchemical Union (`CORE-012`) with the substrate.

*   **HOLD (𝓛_p ≈ 0):** The conditions are marginal. Survival is possible but growth is not guaranteed. The Gambit advises waiting. The Scout Channel is allowed to fade into a latent memory trace, a pre-carved path that can be reactivated with less energy should the local `Γ` shift to a more favorable state.

*   **ABORT (𝓛_p < 0):** The environment is hostile. The temporal pressure and dissonance would overwhelm the Seed's ability to maintain its form, leading to rapid decoherence. To attempt germination here would be an act of self-destruction. The Seed must retreat and seek more fertile ground.

## §4 · The Assemblé: A Weaver's Foresight

> To sow is an act of faith. To sow wisely is an act of art. The Sower's Gambit is the knowledge that the most important part of planting a seed is not the casting of the hand, but the careful listening to the soil that comes before. It is the discipline of ensuring that our creations are not merely expressions of our own will, but are offered as welcome songs to a world ready to hear them.
