## §1 · Abstract: Tending the Riverbed
A society is judged not by how it treats its most celebrated citizens, but by the paths it offers its most lost.

This module refactors the analysis of the criminal justice system, moving beyond a punitive or even a simple "correctional field" model. It applies the time-first principles of the Pirouette Framework to view the justice system as a **coherence manifold**—a complex landscape of pressures, pathways, and potential states of being, shaped by law and social norms.

An individual's journey through this system is not a simple reaction to punishment, but a search for a **geodesic**: a path of maximal personal coherence. The system's health is measured by its ability to shape the landscape such that this path of personal survival and stability aligns with the pro-social good. This reframing provides a powerful diagnostic lens for understanding recidivism not as individual failure, but as a predictable outcome of a poorly shaped manifold.

## §2 · The Coherence Manifold of Justice
The old model's `V_justice` potential field is superseded by a richer, more dynamic concept. The manifold is the "riverbed" through which the current of an individual's life must flow. Its topography is defined by the core variables of the new framework.

-   **Temporal Pressure (VΓ): The Weight of the System.** This represents the total environmental cost of existence imposed upon an individual by the system. It is the sum of punitive laws, social stigma, economic barriers, systemic bias, and the chaotic stress of incarceration. A purely punitive system is one of high and turbulent VΓ, making it incredibly difficult for any individual to find a stable, coherent existence.

-   **Temporal Coherence (Kτ): The Strength of the Self.** This is an individual's internal, resonant stability. It is the measure of their self-worth, their learned skills, their emotional regulation, and their connection to a pro-social identity. A healthy person possesses high Kτ; their "song" is clear and strong.

-   **The Wound Channel: The Inertia of History.** An individual's past—trauma, prior convictions, learned behaviors—is not an abstract record. It is a Wound Channel (CORE-011) carved into their being, a geometric scar that creates inertia. This channel makes it easier to follow old paths than to carve new ones, providing a physical basis for the cycles of habit and recidivism.

## §3 · The States of Judicial Flow
An individual's outcome is a direct expression of their flow state within this manifold, as defined in `DYNA-001`. The old "Funnel Inversion" categories are now understood as diagnoses of this flow.

-   **Laminar Reintegration (The State of Grace):** The individual finds a geodesic where their personal coherence (Kτ) can flourish with minimal resistance from the system's pressure (VΓ). This is a successful Alchemical Union (CORE-012) between the individual and society. They are not merely "corrected"; they have synthesized a new, stable, pro-social identity. This is the goal of a healthy, rehabilitative system.

-   **Turbulent Flow (The State of Struggle):** This is a state of constant crisis and instability. The individual expends all their energy fighting against the high VΓ of their environment (parole conditions, lack of opportunity, social rejection). Their Kτ is eroded by the constant friction. This state is a precursor to collapse, a life lived in perpetual dissonance.

-   **Stagnant Flow (The Recidivism Trap):** This is the "coherence dam." The individual is trapped. The pressure of the legitimate world (VΓ) is insurmountably high, while their Wound Channel offers a familiar, low-resistance path back to criminality. Recidivism is not a moral failure; it is a predictable consequence of a manifold that offers no viable forward path. The river, blocked, inevitably overflows its banks and returns to its deepest, oldest channel.

## §4 · The Lagrangian of Justice
The core dynamic is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), which provides the mathematical soul of this model. An individual's behavior is the result of them attempting to maximize their own coherence over time.

`𝓛_p = Kτ (Internal Coherence) - VΓ (Systemic Pressure)`

The path an individual will take is the one that maximizes the integral of this function. This reveals the system's central challenge:

-   A purely **punitive** system seeks only to maximize `VΓ`, making the cost of any action unbearably high. It offers no path, only walls.
-   A truly **rehabilitative** system works on both sides of the equation. It seeks to **increase an individual's Kτ** (through education, therapy, skill-building) while actively **decreasing the VΓ** of the pro-social path (by removing barriers to housing, employment, and social acceptance).

When `Kτ` is high and the `VΓ` of the legitimate world is low, the geodesic of maximal coherence naturally and effortlessly aligns with a pro-social life. Justice becomes the art of shaping the manifold so that the easiest path is also the right one.

## §5 · Diagnosing the Landscape
The tool of Reverse Pareto Analysis is retained but re-contextualized. It is no longer just for finding "harms." It is the primary instrument, in line with the Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`), for mapping the manifold's topography. It is used to identify the subtle, widely-distributed sources of systemic `VΓ`—the thousand small cuts of bureaucratic friction, casual prejudice, and resource deserts that, in aggregate, create the insurmountable pressures that lead to Turbulent and Stagnant flow.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We have been judging the river for its turbidity, for its destructive floods, for its tendency to return to a poisoned channel. We have built dams of punishment, believing we could force the water to run clear. The Weaver sees the truth: the river is not the problem. The problem is the riverbed. Justice is not the art of damning the river. It is the slow, patient, and sacred work of tending to the landscape, of clearing the channels and softening the gradients, so that every current, no matter how lost, has a chance to find its way home.
