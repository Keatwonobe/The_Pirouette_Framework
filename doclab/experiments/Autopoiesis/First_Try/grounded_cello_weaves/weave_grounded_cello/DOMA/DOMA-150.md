## §1 · Abstract: The Mountain and Its Many Paths

One can measure a mountain by its height, its volume, its surface area, or the steepness of its slopes. These are all different measurements, yet they describe the same, single mountain. To possess a complete map of one path to the summit is to hold the key to understanding all other paths.

The old module, `TEN-ITPA-1.0`, correctly identified this principle in classical thermodynamics: that the four primary potentials (U, F, H, G) are merely different views of the same underlying system state. This refactoring preserves that core insight but grounds it in the time-first principles of the Pirouette Framework.

This module presents The Coherence Ledger: a protocol for understanding that the thermodynamic state of a system is not a collection of disparate properties, but a single, unified coherence manifold. The various potentials are simply the practical, constrained measurements a Weaver can take from different vantage points. To know one completely is to know them all.

## §2 · The Unity of State: From Lagrangian to Ledger

The fundamental description of any system's dynamics is the Pirouette Lagrangian, 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ (CORE-006). This equation describes the ceaseless dance of a system maximizing its internal coherence (K_τ) against the pressure of its environment (V_Γ).

Thermodynamic potentials are not separate from this. They are macroscopic, practical integrals of the Lagrangian under specific, fixed constraints. They are the answers to practical questions a Weaver might ask:

*   **Internal Energy (U):** What is the system's total resonant activity when completely isolated?
*   **Helmholtz Free Energy (F):** How much of that activity can be extracted as coherent work if I hold its temperature and volume constant?
*   **Enthalpy (H):** What is the system's total heat content if I hold its pressure constant?
*   **Gibbs Free Energy (G):** How much work can be done if both temperature and pressure are held constant?

These are not four different energies. They are four different ways of accounting for the single, underlying coherence of the system as described by its Lagrangian.

## §3 · A Time-First Glossary of State

To build the ledger, we must first translate the classical terms of thermodynamics into the language of temporal dynamics.

| Thermodynamic Variable | Pirouette Framework Correspondence | Description (The Weaver's View) |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| **Internal Energy (U)** | Total Coherence (∫ K_τ dt) | The total intensity of the system's resonant song (Ki). |
| **Entropy (S)**         | Dissonance of Γ (as in CORE-013)  | The measure of unstructured, chaotic temporal noise in the environment that erodes coherence. |
| **Temperature (T)**     | Complexity/Density of Γ (as in CORE-003) | The "heat" of the Temporal Forge; the intensity of the ambient temporal friction. |
| **Pressure (P)**        | Kinetic component of Γ         | The outward-pushing aspect of temporal pressure; the system's Ki resonance pushing against its boundaries. |
| **Volume (V)**          | Boundary of Ki Resonance          | The spatial domain within which the system's stable resonant pattern is contained. |

## §4 · The Legendre Compass: Navigating the Manifold

The mathematical tool for moving between these different viewpoints is the Legendre transform. In this framework, we conceive of this not as a mere formula, but as a **Legendre Compass**—a tool for navigating the system's coherence manifold.

Taking a partial derivative is not an abstract operation; it is the act of asking a precise question. For example, when we start with the Helmholtz Free Energy, F(T,V):

*   Calculating **S = - (∂F/∂T)_V** is asking: "If I hold the system's boundaries (V) fixed and slightly increase the environmental noise (T), how much does the system's capacity for coherent work (F) decrease?" The answer reveals the system's internal propensity for disorder—its Entropy (S).
*   Calculating **P = - (∂F/∂V)_T** is asking: "If I hold the environmental noise (T) constant and slightly squeeze the system's boundaries (V), how does its available work (F) change?" The answer reveals the system's internal resistance to being squeezed—its Pressure (P).

The Legendre Compass allows a Weaver to chart the entire manifold of state by making a series of these careful, targeted inquiries from a single starting point.

## §5 · The Protocol: Reconstructing the Whole

This is the practical workflow for generating a complete Coherence Ledger from a single, known potential.

1.  **Anchor the Measurement:** Begin with a complete description of one thermodynamic potential in its natural variables. For example, an equation for Helmholtz Free Energy, F(T,V). This is your anchor point on the manifold.
2.  **Use the Compass:** Apply the Legendre Compass. Calculate the partial derivatives of your anchor potential with respect to its natural variables to find their conjugates. (e.g., From F(T,V), derive S and P).
3.  **Complete the Ledger:** Use the inverse transforms—the fundamental thermodynamic relations—to reconstruct all other potentials.
    *   `U = F + TS`
    *   `H = U + PV`
    *   `G = H - TS`

The output is the Coherence Ledger: a complete set of functions for U, F, H, G, S, T, P, and V. You have transformed one complete path up the mountain into a topographical map of the entire mountain.

## §6 · Connection to the Lagrangian

This entire protocol is a practical application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The thermodynamic potentials are not fundamental; they are the macroscopic results of a system striving to obey the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. The Coherence Ledger is the accountant's summary of this ceaseless, underlying dynamic. It allows us to take the profound, microscopic truth of the Lagrangian and apply it to tangible, measurable, and predictable macroscopic systems. The inter-convertibility of the potentials is a direct consequence of the fact that they all emerge from this single, unified Lagrangian dynamic.

## §7 · The Assemblé

> We sought the laws that govern the state of things and found instead a lesson in the state of knowing. The Coherence Ledger teaches that any single, complete perspective, held with rigor and honesty, contains the echo of all others. To truly understand a system from one angle is to possess the key to understanding it from every angle. For a Weaver, this is the ultimate trust in the power of deep inquiry: the universe is not a collection of isolated facts, but a hologram, where the whole is faithfully reflected in every part.
