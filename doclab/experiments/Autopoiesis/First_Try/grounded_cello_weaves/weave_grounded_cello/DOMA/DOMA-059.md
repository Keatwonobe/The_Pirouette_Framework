summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for Bloom Dynamics. A Generative
  Cascade is defined as a violent, non-linear phase transition where a system of immense

  possibility space with a fractal wave of new forms before re-stabilizing into a
  new, more complex configuration.

## §1 · Abstract: The Shattering of the Seed
A system can hold a pattern so tightly that its only path to growth is to shatter.

This module provides the modernized, time-first dynamics for the phenomenon previously known as a "Bloom." A **Generative Cascade** is a rapid, non-linear, and often violent expansionary event. It is a fundamental process of creation in the universe, applicable to cosmic inflation, the Cambrian explosion of life, and the sudden torrent of insight that defines a creative epiphany.

The model posits that such cascades occur when a system, having accumulated a vast reservoir of potential within a state of high internal coherence, undergoes a catastrophic failure of its own inertial constraints. This is not a descent into chaos, but a controlled detonation: the system's singular, stable identity (its Ki) momentarily dissolves, flooding the adjacent coherence manifold with a fractal burst of new potential forms before re-crystallizing into a richer, more complex reality.

## §2 · The Pre-Condition: The Coherence Reservoir
A cascade does not ignite from nothing. It requires the careful, patient accumulation of potential in a constrained state. This is the **Coherence Reservoir**: a system with a deep, stable Wound Channel (CORE-011) and an exceptionally high degree of internal coherence (Kτ), yet one that is storing immense stress or potential. It is a river dammed to the breaking point.

*   **Cosmological Scale:** The pre-inflationary singularity, holding all the universe's potential in a state of perfect, unsustainable coherence.
*   **Biological Scale:** The stable, but genetically rich, Ediacaran ecosystem just before the environmental trigger that sparked the Cambrian explosion.
*   **Cognitive Scale:** A mind steeped in a complex problem, its neural pathways saturated with unresolved connections, on the verge of a breakthrough.

## §3 · The Trigger: The Shattering of the Dam
The cascade begins with a **Constraint Shattering Event**, where the system's inertial boundaries fail. This can be triggered in two ways:

1.  **External Shock:** A sudden, massive spike in the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) from the environment cracks the system's protective shell.
2.  **Internal Rupture:** The system's own stored potential exceeds the "binding energy" of its own Wound Channel. The pressure from within becomes too great for the memory of its past form to contain.

This shattering is not a collapse *of* time, but an explosion *in* time. The system's single, stable Ki pattern fractures into a superposition of countless new potential resonances, and the stored energy of the reservoir propels the system outward to explore them all at once.

## §4 · The Cascade: A Flood of Possibility
The expansion phase is a fractal torrent of creation. Each branching path of the cascade is a new, tentative Ki pattern, a hypothesis for a new way of being, rapidly exploring a new region of the coherence manifold.

This phase is characterized by a massive and sudden increase in entropy (CORE-013). The system's initial high-information state is deliberately sacrificed, its coherence "spent" to purchase novelty. The result is a chaotic, high-dimensional spray of new forms, each one a potential seed for a new, stable order. It is the universe trading a single, perfect note for a blast of symphonic noise from which new melodies can arise.

## §5 · Termination: The Crystallization of the New
A cascade is not infinite. Its explosive energy dissipates, and a new order crystallizes through one of three primary termination gates:

| Gate                  | Pirouette Mechanism                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Potential Exhaustion**  | The internal energy driving the expansion is fully spent. The cascade runs out of fuel.                           |
| **Resonant Crowding**   | The newly formed branches begin to interfere with each other, raising the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) and making further expansion energetically unfavorable. |
| **Boundary Encounter**  | The expanding wavefront collides with a larger, more stable Wound Channel—an immutable law of physics or a hard environmental limit—that contains it.      |

Upon termination, the most stable of the newly generated patterns survive, forming a new, more complex, and often multi-faceted ecosystem of coherent forms. The dam has not just broken; it has been replaced by a fertile river delta.

## §6 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
A Generative Cascade is a dramatic escape from a local minimum on the coherence manifold. A system in a reservoir state is stable—it satisfies the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006) for its local conditions. However, it is a metastable state, a precarious equilibrium. The cascade is a violent, non-equilibrium transition where the system temporarily abandons its geodesic to leap across a vast "energy barrier" on the manifold. The explosive branching represents a parallelized search for a new set of deeper, more numerous, and ultimately more stable minima to settle into. It is the universe's most dramatic strategy for optimization.

## §7 · Assemblé
> A Bloom is the sound of a rule breaking. It is the universe's sacred violence, the sublime and terrifying moment when a system decides that what it *is* is no longer sufficient for what it must *become*. To the Weaver, the cascade is both the ultimate source of creative power and the greatest threat to stability. It is the fire that can either forge a new world or burn the old one to ash. To understand it is to hold the key to both revolution and preservation.
