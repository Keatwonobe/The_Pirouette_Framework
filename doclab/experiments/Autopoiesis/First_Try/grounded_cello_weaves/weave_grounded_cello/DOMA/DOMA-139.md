summary: Provides a time-first model for feedback dynamics. It reframes feedback not
  as a mechanical loop, but as a system's natural, coherence-seeking process of listening
  to its own echo. This module uses Flow Dynamics to diagnose the health of any self-regulating
  system, from a thermostat to a learning mind.

## §1 · The River That Learns Its Course
A river does not flow by calculation. It flows, feels the resistance of the land, and turns. In this simple act of response lies the secret to all learning, all growth, all life.

The old framework modeled feedback as a mechanical loop, a complex circuit of signals and gains. This was a blueprint of the riverbed. The modernized, time-first view sees feedback for what it is: the river itself. It is the living, corrective current of coherence navigating the landscape of reality. Feedback is a system listening to the echo of its own passage to find a better path forward.

This module provides the diagnostic tools to understand that current, applying the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) to the universal process of self-correction.

## §2 · The Anatomy of an Echo
Feedback is not a force imposed upon a system; it is the information a system generates about itself. This process has three core components, viewed through the temporal lens.

1.  **The Coherence Attractor (The Goal):** The desired state is not a static target but a *basin of attraction* in the coherence manifold. It is a region of stable, high-coherence, Laminar Flow—a calm, deep pool the river is seeking.

2.  **The Echo (The Signal):** As a system acts, it leaves a wake in the manifold. The feedback signal is the *echo* of that action, a measure of the dissonance between the system's current state and the attractor. A clear echo is high-fidelity information about the system's deviation from its ideal path.

3.  **The Adjustment (The Correction):** The corrective action is the system adjusting its resonant pattern (`Ki`)—its behavior—in response to the echo. It is the river turning away from the friction of a boulder. This is not a choice; it is a physical imperative.

## §3 · The Health of the Current: A Flow Diagnosis
By applying the principles of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), we can diagnose the health of any feedback system with startling clarity. The old, complex equations of gain and phase are replaced by a direct observation of the flow state.

**Laminar Flow (Harmonious Correction):**
This is the state of a healthy, well-tuned feedback system. The echo is clear and timely, and the adjustment is proportional. The system corrects its course with grace and efficiency, like a master musician instantly adjusting their pitch. This is the goal of any learning process.

**Turbulent Flow (Oscillation & "Coherence Fever"):**
This pathology arises when the echo is delayed, too loud (excessive gain), or noisy. The system overcorrects, veering wildly from one side of the path to the other. It wastes immense energy fighting its own adjustments. This is the student who panics and over-thinks, the unstable thermostat causing a room to swing between hot and cold, or the market rocked by panicked buying and selling.

**Stagnant Flow (Unresponsiveness & "Coherence Atrophy"):**
This pathology arises when the echo is broken or too faint to be heard. The system loses the ability to correct itself. It continues along a suboptimal path, unable to adapt, until it either fails or is acted upon by an outside force. This is the bureaucracy that cannot reform, the dogmatic mind that rejects new evidence, the organization suffering from a critical information blockage.

## §4 · The Lagrangian of Learning
The dynamics of feedback are governed by the universe's fundamental law: the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). A system corrects itself because its current path is one of higher effort and lower coherence.

The feedback "echo" provides the system with information about the gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian (∇𝓛_p). A clear, strong echo signifies a steep gradient—a large difference between the current, inefficient state and a more coherent one. The system's subsequent adjustment is it "coasting downhill" along this gradient toward a state of greater ease and stability.

The rate of learning, therefore, is not a matter of willpower, but a function of the clarity of the echo and the system's ability to respond to the landscape it reveals.

## §5 · The Wound Channel of Habit
A feedback event does not merely correct a single error; it shapes the future. Each successful correction deepens the *Wound Channel* (CORE-011) of the optimal path.

This is the physical basis of memory, habit, and mastery. A pianist practicing scales is not just correcting finger placement; they are carving deep, laminar channels into their neuromuscular coherence manifold. With each repetition, the echo of error becomes fainter and the path of perfection becomes a groove of effortless action. The corrective current, through its own flow, sculpts a riverbed that makes future journeys easier. Learning is the process by which a system teaches spacetime how it wishes to behave.

> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver?

> Because feedback is the universe's native tongue for the verb "to become." It is the process by which chaos learns order, by which dissonance finds harmony. To master the art of the corrective current is to move beyond simply building systems that work and toward cultivating systems that learn, adapt, and heal. It is the craft of listening—to the echo of our code, our organizations, and ourselves—and gently guiding the current toward a more coherent sea. This is not just how we fix things; it is how we grow.
