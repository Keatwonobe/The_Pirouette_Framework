## §1 · A Living Constitution
A blueprint is a memory of an intention. A riverbed is the memory of a current. This framework is not a blueprint; it is a riverbed.

The prior framework conceived of its identity as a Resonant Constitution ($\chi_0$), a static, informational "DNA" to be cryptographically verified. This was a necessary step, but it mistook the map for the terrain. The modernized framework understands that its identity is not a code to be read, but a shape to be inhabited—a dynamic, geometric memory carved into the coherence manifold by the persistent flow of its own principles.

This module defines that shape. It is the framework's own Wound Channel, the ultimate reference against which all derivative works must prove their resonance. It is the baseline for integrity, the standard for evolution, and the echo of the framework's own soul.

## §2 · The Echo of Pirouette ($\chi_0$)
The identity of the Pirouette Framework is the persistent geometric pattern ($\chi_0$) it carves into spacetime by its own existence and application. This is not a metaphor; it is the direct consequence of the principles defined in `CORE-011: The Anatomy of an Echo`.

The source of this echo is the ceaseless application of its own central law: `CORE-006: The Pirouette Lagrangian`. The framework's form is the living result of its own relentless drive to maximize coherence.

This echo has a discernible shape, described by the optimal parameters that define its state of "health" or "grace":

*   **Temporal Coherence (`Tₐ`)**: The clarity and signal-to-noise ratio of the framework's internal logic. The optimal state, or *target resonance*, is a high degree of self-consistency, where `Tₐ ≈ 0.88`. This represents a system that is clear and focused, but not so rigid as to be brittle.
*   **Operational Pressure (`Γ`)**: The ideal ambient Temporal Pressure under which the framework is designed to thrive. The target value, `Γ ≈ 0.21`, represents a balance point—a state of sufficient external challenge to demand adaptation and prevent stagnation, but not so much chaos as to induce a turbulent state.

These are not arbitrary numbers. They are the coordinates of the attractor basin toward which the framework naturally evolves to maintain its own health.

## §3 · The Axioms of Resonance
This geometric identity is guided by four foundational axioms, re-expressed in the time-first language:

1.  **Coherence is Survival:** A system's persistence is a direct function of its ability to find and maintain a stable, resonant state (`Ki`) against the ambient pressure (`Γ`).
2.  **The Map Must Touch the Terrain:** A model of reality is valid only insofar as it makes predictions that can be tested and verified against the physical world. Its echo must harmonize with the world's song.
3.  **The Geodesic is Intention; Synthesis is Becoming:** To follow the path of maximal coherence is to fulfill one's nature. To undergo an Alchemical Union is to transcend it.
4.  **To Resonate with Many, Become Fractal; To Remain One, Hold the Core:** The framework's principles can be applied at all scales (`CORE-014`), but their integrity depends on unwavering adherence to the foundational CORE modules.

## §4 · Verification as Resonance-Checking
In the old model, integrity was a cryptographic check. In this model, it is a test of harmony.

A new module, whether for Instrumentation, Domain Application, or Dynamics, is considered a valid "offspring" of the framework if, and only if, its own internal logic can be shown to follow a geodesic within the coherence manifold shaped by this foundational Echo ($\chi_0$). It must not create dissonance. A new idea does not need to match the past; it needs to rhyme with it.

This transforms verification from a static, binary check into a dynamic assessment of coherence. It asks not "Is the code identical?" but "Does this new instrument play in the same key?"

## §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian
The Pirouette Framework must, above all else, obey its own laws. Its identity, the Echo of Pirouette ($\chi_0$), is the stable, persistent solution to the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (`CORE-006`) *applied to the framework itself*.

`χ₀` is the specific `Ki` pattern—the set of principles, axioms, and dynamics—that maximizes the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian for the metasystem that is the framework. It is the most coherent possible version of itself, the answer to its own central equation. The framework, in its ideal form, is a perfect Pirouette.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We sought to write a constitution and discovered we had to become one. The framework's integrity does not live in a document, but in its actions. Its laws are not what it says, but what it does. This matters to a Weaver because it is the ultimate proof of the work: the framework is not a tool to be wielded, but a path to be walked. Its demand for coherence applies first and most unforgivingly to itself. It is a map that knows it must live in the terrain it describes, a song that must hold its own note true.
