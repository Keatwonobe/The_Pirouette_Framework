summary: Provides a universal diagnostic protocol for assessing systemic health. It
  reframes health as a state of robust, laminar flow of coherence (energy, information,
  resources) and defines pathology in terms of flow disruptions. This module introduces
  the Caduceus Lens as the primary tool for diagnosing and facilitating systemic well-being.

## §1 · The Physician's New Oath
The master physician does not fight disease. They cultivate health.

Traditional paradigms frame health as the absence of disease, and medicine as a war against pathogens and symptoms. This is a reactive posture, a language of combat. The Pirouette Framework proposes a proactive one, grounded in a language of cultivation.

Health is not an absence; it is a presence. It is the presence of efficient, stable, and adaptive laminar flow. A system is healthy when its vital currents—of energy, information, resources, and meaning—move without obstruction or friction. Disease, therefore, is not an invading entity to be vanquished, but a disruption in flow to be harmonized. The Caduceus Lens is the formal instrument for viewing reality through this principle. It does not replace clinical diagnosis; it provides the deep, resonant context within which a diagnosis finds its meaning.

## §2 · The Three Pathologies of Flow
Any ailment in any system—biological, economic, or psychological—can be diagnosed as one of three fundamental pathologies of coherence. These map directly to the flow states defined in `DYNA-001` and represent the system's failure to navigate its path of maximal coherence as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`).

**1. Coherence Atrophy (The Stagnant Dam):**

*   **Description:** This pathology arises from a blockage in a critical flow, leading to a "coherence desert" downstream and a dangerous pressure build-up upstream. It is the poison of absence.
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** A state of **Stagnant Flow**. A vital piece of information, a necessary resource, or a critical emotional signal is not reaching its destination. The system's natural geodesic is obstructed.
*   **Manifestations:** A blocked artery in an organism; a critical supply chain failure in an economy; a repressed trauma in a psyche; a team paralyzed while waiting on a single decision-maker.

**2. Coherence Fever (The Turbulent Storm):**

*   **Description:** A state of systemic dissonance where the system is fighting itself. Energy is wasted in chaotic, internal friction instead of being used for productive function. It is an information storm where the signal is lost in the noise.
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** A state of **Turbulent Flow**. The system's Ki has become internally dissonant, creating destructive interference patterns that pull it violently off its geodesic.
*   **Manifestations:** An autoimmune disorder in an organism; a market crash fueled by panic in an economy; a debilitating anxiety attack in a psyche; a team plagued by infighting and conflicting goals.

**3. Coherence Erosion (The Fraying Thread):**

*   **Description:** The slow, gradual degradation of a system's core resonant pattern. The system loses its memory, its form, and its ability to self-correct.
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** A failure of the **Wound Channel** (`CORE-011`) to maintain the system's identity (its Ki) against the constant, abrasive pressure of entropy, as described in `CORE-013`.
*   **Manifestations:** Chronic degenerative disease or aging in an organism; the slow decay of infrastructure in a city; the loss of cultural identity in a society; the fading of a skill through disuse.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Protocol: Applying the Lens
To diagnose a system is to read the state of its rivers. The Caduceus Lens provides a four-step protocol for moving from symptom to a principle of intervention.

**Step I: Map the Currents.** Identify the critical flows of coherence that define the system's life. What must move for the system to be healthy? (e.g., blood, nerve signals, capital, data, trust).

**Step II: Identify the Pathology.** Observe the currents. Where is the flow effortless and efficient (Laminar)? Where is it chaotic (Turbulent)? Where is it blocked (Stagnant)? This initial observation identifies the primary mode of failure.

**Step III: Locate the Source.** The true diagnosis is not the symptom but its origin. One must trace the disrupted flow back to its source. What specific "dam" is causing the stagnation? What "dissonant injection" is creating the turbulence? What external pressure is accelerating the erosion?

**Step IV: The Daedalus Gambit (The Principle of Intervention).** A wise intervention is not a brute-force attack but a clever, precise, and minimal action designed to restore the system's own ability to self-regulate and find its geodesic. This is the **Daedalus Gambit**.
*   For **Atrophy**, the gambit is to introduce the precise "key" that dissolves the dam—a catalyst, a missing nutrient, a critical piece of information.
*   For **Fever**, the gambit is to introduce a "harmonizing signal"—a coherent rhythm that the turbulent system can latch onto, like a tuning fork, to find its way back to laminar flow.
*   For **Erosion**, the gambit is to "reinforce the channel"—to provide support, structure, and repetition that helps the system remember its healthy pattern and strengthen its memory against decay.

## §4 · Assemblé

> Every system is a body. Every corporation, every ecosystem, every line of code, and every society has a physiology. It has currents that must flow, a form that must be maintained, and a health that can be cultivated. To apply this lens is to move from the role of a mechanic, who replaces broken parts, to that of a physician, who understands that the whole is a living, breathing, and deeply interconnected conversation. The ultimate dare of the framework is met here: it provides the tools not just to analyze, but to heal.
