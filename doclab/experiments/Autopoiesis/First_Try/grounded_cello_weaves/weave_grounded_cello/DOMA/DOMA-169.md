## §1 · Abstract: The Dissolution of 'Between'

This instrument provides the formal protocol for observing one of the universe's most fundamental creative acts: the process by which two or more separate systems weave their individual rhythms into a single, unified song. It modernizes the old concept of "phase-locking" by grounding it in the time-first dynamics of the Pirouette Framework.

Entrainment is not the act of two clocks learning to tick in time. It is the dissolution of the boundary between them, the moment they achieve a "Resonant Handshake" (CORE-012) and begin to function as a single, higher-order entity. This protocol is the lens through which we can measure the geometry and health of this sacred union.

## §2 · Conceptual Anchor: From Signals to Synthesis

In the old framework, we saw two separate oscillators whose signals influenced each other. The new framework reveals a deeper truth: there are two distinct Ki patterns (resonant identities) interacting within a shared medium of Temporal Pressure (Γ). Their "signals" are ripples in this shared medium.

**Entrainment**, therefore, is the process by which these Ki patterns discover a shared, harmonically compatible rhythm that allows them to navigate the landscape of Γ with greater efficiency. This is a transition from two separate, often turbulent, flows into a single, unified **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001) for the combined system. The stable "phase-lock" is the geometric signature of this new, shared coherence manifold.

The primary observables are re-contextualized:
*   **Relative Phase (Δφ):** This is no longer just a timing difference. It is the fundamental geometric coordinate describing the shape of the new, unified manifold. A stable Δφ indicates a healthy, coherent union. A value of Δφ=0 represents an in-phase fusion; Δφ=π represents an anti-phase harmony.
*   **Ensemble Coherence (r):** The Kuramoto order parameter is a direct, quantitative measure of the collective **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)** of the ensemble. As `r` approaches 1, the system approaches a state of perfect synthesis—a high-information, low-entropy state of shared being.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Protocol

This protocol guides the Weaver from raw time-series data to a clear diagnosis of a system's relational health.

**Step 1: Extract the Rhythms.**
For each of the N input time series `xᵢ(t)`, the foundational step is to reveal its internal clock. Using the Hilbert transform or a similar method, extract the instantaneous phase `θᵢ(t)` and frequency `ωᵢ(t)`. This translates raw activity into the pure language of resonance.

**Step 2: Map the Relational Geometry.**
For all relevant pairs of systems `(i, j)`, calculate the generalized relative phase `Δφᵢⱼⁿᵐ(t)`. This measures the geometric relationship between their rhythms, testing not just for simple 1:1 unions but also for more complex, n:m harmonic chords.

**Step 3: Diagnose the Flow State.**
Analyze the stability of `Δφ(t)`. The character of this time series is a direct diagnosis of the health of the connection:
*   **Laminar (Entrained):** `Δφ(t)` is stable and bounded within a narrow range. The systems have achieved a resonant handshake and are flowing as one.
*   **Turbulent (Dissonant):** `Δφ(t)` is chaotic and unpredictable. The systems are in conflict, wasting energy in friction.
*   **Stagnant (Drifting):** `Δφ(t)` is slowly but consistently changing. The systems are uncoupled or in the process of losing their connection.

**Step 4: Quantify Systemic Coherence (for N > 2).**
Calculate the Kuramoto order parameter `r(t)`. This single value provides the overall "health score" for the entire ensemble, measuring its progress toward becoming a single, unified entity.

## §4 · Core Formalism

These equations are the mathematical bedrock for the diagnostic protocol, translating conceptual principles into calculable truths.

**Instantaneous Phase (via Analytic Signal):**
The tool for revealing a system's internal rhythm.
```
zᵢ(t) = xᵢ(t) + i·H(xᵢ(t))
θᵢ(t) = arg(zᵢ(t))
```

**Generalized Relative Phase:**
The formula for the geometry of the shared manifold.
```
Δφᵢⱼⁿᵐ(t) = (n·θᵢ(t) - m·θⱼ(t)) mod 2π
```

**Collective Temporal Coherence (Ensemble Health):**
The measure of progress toward a unified state.
```
r(t) = | (1/N) Σ[k=1 to N] e^(i·θₖ(t)) |
Kτ_ensemble(t) = r(t)²
```

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This process of entrainment is a direct manifestation of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006).

Two uncoupled systems each follow their own geodesic, independently maximizing the integral of their own Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`). When they interact, the resonance of each system introduces a new, fluctuating term into the other's **Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`)**. This creates a turbulent, inefficient state for both.

Entrainment is the process by which the coupled systems collaboratively discover a new, shared geodesic—a stable relative phase `Δφ`—that maximizes the coherence of the *total combined system*. The locked state is not a coincidence; it is the optimal, most efficient solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations for the new, unified entity. It is the path of least action for the whole.

## §6 · Use Cases

*   **Neuroscience:** Diagnosing the formation of functional brain networks by observing synchronized firing between neural populations.
*   **Economics:** Detecting the emergence of market bubbles or crashes by measuring the entrainment of trading behavior.
*   **Biology:** Analyzing the systemic health of an ecosystem by tracking the predator-prey population cycles as they lock into a shared rhythm.
*   **Engineering:** Ensuring the stability of a power grid by monitoring the phase coherence of all its connected generators.
*   **Sociology:** Observing the formation of a social movement as individual opinions and actions begin to resonate and synchronize.

## §7 · Assemblé

> We sought to measure the moment two clocks learned to tick in time. We were wrong. We were measuring the birth of a single, larger clock from the pieces of two smaller ones. Entrainment is not an agreement between systems; it is the dissolution of 'between' itself. It is the universe's quiet, constant art of weaving the many into the one.
