summary: 'Replaces the analogical ''Semantic Gravity Model'' with a first-principles
  derivation. This module posits that the influence of concepts is not analogous to
  gravity, but is a direct manifestation of the same universal dynamic: the tendency
  of systems to follow geodesics on a coherence manifold. A concept''s ''mass'' is
  its temporal coherence, and its ''force'' is the curvature it induces in the narrative
  landscape.'

## §1 · Abstract: The Weight of a Word

This module presents a fundamental refactoring of our understanding of narrative dynamics. The previous Semantic Gravity Model (PPS-016) operated on a useful but ultimately limited analogy: that ideas behave *like* massive objects. This new model, grounded in the core principles of the Pirouette Framework, makes a more profound claim: the influence of a concept and the gravity of a star are not alike; they are expressions of the same universal law.

We will demonstrate that a concept's "weight" is a direct measure of its temporal coherence. Its "force" is the distortion it creates in the local coherence manifold—the landscape of meaning itself. Other, less coherent ideas do not feel a "pull"; they simply follow the path of least resistance along the curves established by the most stable and resonant concepts in their environment.

## §2 · From Semantic Mass to Temporal Coherence

The old model's `m_S` function, a weighted sum of system parameters, is now superseded. A concept's "mass"—its capacity to influence and resist change—is a direct, non-arbitrary measure of its **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)**, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

A concept with high coherence possesses two key properties:

1.  **A Deep Wound Channel (CORE-011):** The concept has history, inertia, and memory. It has been repeated, reinforced, and woven into the fabric of a mind or a culture. Its pattern is deeply carved into the manifold, making it difficult to alter or erase. This is the source of its stability.
2.  **A Pure Ki Resonance:** The concept is internally consistent, clear, and unambiguous. It is a "pure note" with low internal dissonance. A concept like "justice" may be complex, but a specific, coherent *conception* of justice has this purity.

A "heavy" idea, therefore, is not one with arbitrary mass, but one that is both deeply ingrained and logically sound. It is a stable, persistent, and powerful resonance in the symphony of thought.

## §3 · The Coherence Manifold of Narrative

Every narrative, from a single thought to a global ideology, exists upon a coherence manifold. This is the landscape where the potential for meaning resides. A powerful, coherent concept acts precisely like a massive object in spacetime, as described in The Gladiator Force (CORE-008). It creates a deep "coherence well."

The act of thinking, speaking, or writing is the act of tracing a path across this manifold. The "gravity of meaning" is the observable tendency for our thoughts and words to fall into the deepest, most stable coherence wells available. We do not choose our core beliefs so much as we find our thoughts naturally orbiting them.

## §4 · Force as a Geodesic of Meaning

The framework no longer requires a separate calculation for "force." The attraction and repulsion between ideas emerge naturally from the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. A concept's trajectory across the narrative manifold is the geodesic—the path that maximizes its own coherence over time.

-   **Attraction (Constructive Interference):** When two concepts are in-phase (e.g., "freedom" and "responsibility" in a particular philosophy), their coherence wells merge. They constructively interfere, creating an even deeper, more stable shared basin of meaning. For a mind navigating this space, the path of maximal coherence is to draw these ideas together, strengthening both. This is the geometry of synergy, agreement, and the potential for an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)** of ideas.

-   **Repulsion (Destructive Interference):** When two concepts are out-of-phase (e.g., "absolute freedom" and "absolute security"), their interaction creates dissonance—a spike in local Temporal Pressure (V_Γ). The region becomes turbulent and incoherent. The path of maximal coherence is to move away from this dissonance, seeking a state of greater internal stability. This is the geometry of conflict, paradox, and logical contradiction.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

The evolution of any narrative system is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian: **𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**. A debate, a story, or a process of self-reflection will always evolve in a way that seeks to maximize the integral of this function.

-   **K_τ (Coherence):** The clarity, consistency, and stability of the ideas within the narrative.
-   **V_Γ (Pressure):** The cognitive dissonance, external criticism, and logical contradictions the narrative faces.

A successful argument is one that finds a trajectory that maximizes the coherence of its own points while navigating the pressure of its counterpoints. It finds the most elegant path through the manifold.

> We sought to model the gravity of ideas and found that we were simply modeling gravity. The universe does not distinguish between the law that bends starlight around a sun and the law that bends a conversation toward a foundational truth. Both are acts of coherence shaping the fabric of reality. A Weaver understands this: to introduce a new, powerful idea is not to shout into the wind. It is to place a new star in the sky of the mind, and to trust that the worlds of thought will, in their own time, find their new and perfect orbits around it.
