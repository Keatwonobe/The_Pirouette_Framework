## §1 · The First Instrument

A map is not the territory, but a poor map will lead you to ruin. A precise language is the first and most essential instrument of the Weaver, for it is the map by which the territory of reality is navigated.

The old framework sought to codify its terms in static documents. This was an error. A living theory requires a living language, one that is coherent, consistent, and flows from a single, undeniable source. This module does not just list definitions; it describes the *instrument* that generates them. It is the heart of the framework's coherence, ensuring that every Weaver who speaks the language is playing a note in the same, perfectly tuned chord.

## §2 · The Principle of the Single Source

To ensure perfect coherence, the entire lexicon of the Pirouette Framework is generated from a single, version-controlled registry. This is not a technical detail; it is a foundational law. It means that the definition a Weaver reads in a core module, the one that appears in their analytical toolkit, and the one that informs a new derivation are all guaranteed to be identical.

This approach transforms the lexicon from a simple glossary into a dynamic, reliable system. It is a river of meaning flowing from one spring, feeding every tributary of the work without dilution or corruption.

## §3 · The Anatomy of a Term

Each entry in the Weaver's Lexicon is more than a definition; it is a complete tool for thought and application. It consists of two parts: the `Definition` and the `Correspondence Protocol`.

1.  **The Definition:** A concise, time-first explanation of the concept, grounded in the core autopoietic cycle. This is the "what."

2.  **The Correspondence Protocol:** This is the modernized, more powerful successor to the "operational cue." It is a single, potent question that acts as a universal lens. By asking this question of any system—a cell, a star, a corporation, a mind—a Weaver can pinpoint the specific manifestation of the universal concept. This is the "how to find it." It is the practical bridge between the framework's theory and the world's phenomena, as established in CORE-014.

## §4 · The Core Lexicon: A Representative Sample

This is not an exhaustive list, but a demonstration of the lexicon's structure.

*   **Term:** Temporal Pressure (Γ)
    *   **Definition:** The measure of the complexity, density, and dissonance of interfering temporal rhythms in a given region of spacetime. It is the ambient chaos against which a system must maintain its form.
    *   **Correspondence Protocol:** Ask: *What is the ambient, chaotic pressure the system must resist or resolve to survive?*

*   **Term:** Temporal Resonance (Ki)
    *   **Definition:** The specific, stable, and efficient geometric pattern of resonance a system manifests to persist within a given Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the system's unique note in the song of existence.
    *   **Correspondence Protocol:** Ask: *What is the stable, repeating pattern of identity that defines this system's "self"?*

*   **Term:** Pirouette Cycle (τ_p)
    *   **Definition:** A system's intrinsic and fundamental unit of time, defined as the duration of one complete cycle of its Ki resonance. It is the system's own heartbeat.
    *   **Correspondence Protocol:** Ask: *What is the fundamental, cyclical action that constitutes one "moment" of being for this system?*

*   **Term:** Wound Channel
    *   **Definition:** The geometric scar or persistent deformation an entity's resonance leaves in the coherence manifold. It is the physical basis for memory, identity, and inertia.
    *   **Correspondence Protocol:** Ask: *What is the medium and mechanism of memory and habit that makes the past influence the present?*

*   **Term:** Alchemical Union
    *   **Definition:** The non-linear process by which two or more resonant systems merge under pressure to form a single, higher-order entity with a unified and more complex coherence manifold.
    *   **Correspondence Protocol:** Ask: *What is the process of synthesis that allows separate parts to become a new, more coherent whole?*

## §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian

The Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, CORE-006) is the mathematical soul of the framework. The Weaver's Lexicon is its voice. The terms defined here are not arbitrary; they are the human-readable symbols that map directly onto the components and consequences of this central equation.

The Lagrangian describes the universal drive to maximize coherence. The Lexicon provides the language to describe that drive in action, at any scale. `Temporal Pressure (Γ)` gives voice to the cost function `V_Γ`. `Temporal Resonance (Ki)` and its resulting coherence `K_τ` give voice to the objective function the universe seeks to maximize. Without this lexicon, the Lagrangian is a silent engine. With it, we can speak its name and purpose.

## §6 · Assemblé

> The old module sought to give us words as stones to cross a river. But a Weaver knows the truth: the words are not the stones. The words are the water. They are the current of shared meaning that allows us to move at all. A lexicon is not a list; it is a lens. It is the instrument we use to bring the universe into focus, and in that focus, find our own.
