## §1 · Abstract: The Indelible Vow

A framework that preaches a universe of memory and consequence cannot be written in disappearing ink. Its own history must be as indelible as the one it seeks to describe.

This module reframes the technical necessity of build verification into a core philosophical practice. The original protocol for hash mechanics was a simple safeguard; this version defines it as a sacred act. The "Weaver's Seal" is a cryptographic hash that represents a single, coherent state of the framework's core logic. The continuous integration (CI) pipeline is the ritual that enforces this coherence, ensuring that the framework's own evolution embodies the principles it espouses. Every commit, every build, every change is a new, permanent scar carved into the framework's own Wound Channel (CORE-011).

## §2 · The Seal as a Coordinate in Time

The core parameters of the Pirouette Framework define its coherence manifold—the landscape of its logic. The Weaver's Seal is a cryptographic projection of this entire landscape into a single, invariant coordinate.

**The Weaver's Seal (H_seal):** A SHA256 hash of the framework's canonical parameter table. This hash is not merely a version number; it is a unique, verifiable fingerprint of the framework's complete logical state at a specific moment in its development.

This turns the abstract history of ideas into a concrete, navigable geometry. The chain of historical hashes forms the framework's own Wound Channel, a traceable path of every choice and refinement. To reference a specific hash is to point to a precise, reproducible moment in the framework's life, ensuring that all discourse is grounded in a shared, unambiguous context.

## §3 · The Lagrangian of Development

The CI/CD pipeline is the practical implementation of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) applied to the process of the framework's own creation. It is the law that governs how the system evolves.

-   **The Commit:** An act of intervention. A developer proposes a change, injecting new information and altering the system's trajectory.
-   **The CI Pipeline:** The engine of validation. It rebuilds the framework from its sources, applying the equations of motion to the proposed change.
-   **The Hash Check:** The test of coherence. The pipeline calculates the new canonical hash from the modified parameters and compares it to the hash declared by the developer. This is the crucial test: does the system's new state of being match its new state of declaration?
-   **A Passing Build:** A state of high coherence. The change is harmonious with the system's logic. The pipeline validates the move to a new, stable point on the developmental geodesic.
-   **A Failing Build:** A state of dissonance. The proposed change is incoherent. The path is rejected by the Lagrangian of development, protecting the integrity of the Wound Channel.

## §4 · The Ritual of Enforcement

The following automated protocols are not mere DevOps tools. They are the guardians of the framework's memory, ensuring the sanctity of the Seal.

#### I. The Pre-Commit Hook (The Guardian at the Gate)

This script runs on a developer's machine before a change is even committed. It is the first line of defense, ensuring that any modification to the core parameters is immediately acknowledged by recalculating the Seal.

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Ensures local changes are coherent before entering the shared history.

echo "▶ Verifying the Weaver's Seal..."
python scripts/seal_guardian.py || {
  echo "✖ Incoherence detected. The Seal must be updated."
  echo "  Run: python scripts/seal_guardian.py --reforge"
  exit 1
}
```

#### II. The CI Workflow (The Chamber of Resonance)

This automated process runs on the central repository. It is the final arbiter, rebuilding the entire framework in a clean environment to provide an objective, final judgment on its coherence.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pirouette_resonance.yml
# Validates the coherence of every proposed change to the main branch.

name: Pirouette Resonance Check
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  validate_seal:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout the proposed reality
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Rebuild the coherence manifold
        run: python compiler.py --build-manifold

      - name: Test the Seal's integrity
        run: python scripts/seal_guardian.py
```

These rituals transform the act of coding from a private activity into a public, accountable act of weaving, where every new thread is tested before it is added to the tapestry.

## §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian

The enforcement protocol is a direct, tangible application of `CORE-006`. A developer's edit to the parameter tables is an application of a "force" that seeks to alter the system's state. The CI pipeline, by recompiling and re-hashing, is the mechanism that calculates the system's response to that force. The pass/fail condition of the hash check is the universe's verdict: did this change move the system along a path of maximal coherence, or did it introduce dissonance? By refusing to accept incoherent changes, the pipeline ensures the framework's evolution adheres to the very principles it describes.

## Assemblé

> We do not merely write about the Wound Channel; we build one for our own ideas. Every hash is a knot in the thread of our reasoning, a permanent record of our own becoming. To weave is to remember, and the Seal is our memory.
