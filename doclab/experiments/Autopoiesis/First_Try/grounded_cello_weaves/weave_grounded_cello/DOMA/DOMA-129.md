## §1 · Abstract: The Universe's Greatest Hits

The prior framework sought to create a periodic table of static, geometric forms—"dimensional attractors"—to classify reality. This was an attempt to describe the river by cataloging the shapes of its stones. The modern, time-first approach recognizes that the river's essence is its *flow*.

This module introduces the Resonance Canon: a finite set of fundamental *rhythms* of existence. These are not static shapes, but archetypal patterns of flow through which systems move to solve the universal problem of maintaining coherence. They are the universe's most elegant, efficient, and recurring answers to the question posed by the Pirouette Lagrangian. To analyze a system is to listen to its song and recognize which of these canonical melodies it is playing.

## §2 · The Canon: Archetypes of Coherence in Motion

A system does not *have* a dimension; it *performs* a rhythm. The following are the primary archetypes in the Canon, described not as geometries, but as dynamic solutions for navigating the coherence manifold.

1.  **The Geodesic Pulse (Formerly 'Li')**
    *   **Description:** The simplest archetype. A linear, direct, and non-repeating flow of coherence. It is the path of a system moving through a smooth, uncomplicated temporal landscape with a single, clear objective.
    *   **Manifestation:** A photon crossing the void; a project with a clear start and end; a direct, unambiguous command.
    *   **Dynamics:** A state of pure transit, maximizing coherence by minimizing complexity.

2.  **The Pirouette (Formerly 'Pi')**
    *   **Description:** A stable, self-referential, cyclical resonance. This is the fundamental rhythm of *identity*. It is the pattern a system adopts to maintain a persistent state over time. Its geometry naturally gives rise to the constant π.
    *   **Manifestation:** An electron's orbit; the daily cycle of a business; a personal habit.
    *   **Dynamics:** This is the base state for any entity with a defined Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`), forming the foundation of its being.

3.  **The Echo Coil (Formerly 'Ki')**
    *   **Description:** A cyclical pattern that evolves, integrating the memory of its past cycles. It is a spiral in time, perpetually interacting with its own Wound Channel (CORE-011). This is the archetype of learning, adaptation, and growth.
    *   **Manifestation:** The process of mastering a skill; the evolution of a species; a mind reflecting on its own history to make a better future.
    *   **Dynamics:** A system that actively uses its past to increase its future coherence.

4.  **The Duet (Formerly 'Xi')**
    *   **Description:** Two or more distinct resonant patterns phase-locked into a stable, mutually reinforcing dance. This is the simplest expression of a successful Alchemical Union (CORE-012). It is the archetype of symbiosis and stable partnership.
    *   **Manifestation:** A stable binary star system; a successful business partnership; the intertwined strands of DNA.
    *   **Dynamics:** A higher-order coherence forged from the constructive interference of simpler systems.

5.  **The Choice Point (Formerly 'Bi')**
    *   **Description:** The archetype of transformation. It describes a system at a point of critical instability, where its current resonant pattern is no longer viable. The system is forced to shed coherence and collapse into one of two or more new, more stable archetypes.
    *   **Manifestation:** A phase transition (water to ice); a company facing bankruptcy and choosing to pivot or fold; a moment of life-altering decision.
    *   **Dynamics:** The turbulent flow that precedes the establishment of a new laminar order.

## §3 · From Factors to Frequencies: A New Protocol

The old method of "dimensional factorization" was a clumsy proxy for the true analysis. The time-first protocol is more direct and powerful.

1.  **Capture the Temporal Signature:** Record the system's vital signs over time, creating a signal that represents its dynamic behavior.
2.  **Harmonic Decomposition:** Use Fourier analysis or similar techniques to break the complex signal down into its constituent "prime harmonics" or fundamental frequencies.
3.  **Archetype Mapping:** Identify which archetypes from the Canon best describe the dominant harmonics and the relationships between them. Is there one strong, cyclical frequency (a Pirouette)? Is it slowly changing in pitch (an Echo Coil)? Are there two phase-locked frequencies (a Duet)?
4.  **Measure Coherence:** The system's health and stability are not found in an abstract stability number, but in the clarity of its temporal signature. A healthy system has a high signal-to-noise ratio—its chosen archetype is played clearly and strongly. This is a direct measure of its Time Adherence (`T_a`).

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

These archetypes are not arbitrary. They are the most common and robust solutions—the "eigenstates"—of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). A system does not choose an archetype consciously; it falls into the resonant pattern that offers the path of *maximal coherence* for the lowest energetic cost, given the constraints of its environment (Γ). The Resonance Canon is the landscape of the universe's most efficient solutions for being. The Geodesic Pulse is the solution in a simple landscape; the Duet is the solution for two interacting systems; the Echo Coil is the solution for a system that can remember.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We sought a periodic table of the world's forms and found instead its hymnal. The universe is not a sculpture; it is a symphony. Its complexity arises not from an infinitude of parts, but from the endlessly creative arrangement of a few, profound, recurring melodies. The Weaver's art is to listen to the song a system is trying to sing, and to help it find the right key.
