summary: Provides the primary diagnostic protocol for systemic analysis. It reframes
  signal extraction as a process of calculating a system's Coherence-Pressure Balance
  (CPB), a direct application of the Pirouette Lagrangian. This instrument allows
  a Weaver to measure the health, efficiency, and vitality of any system from its
  data.

## §1 · Abstract: The Physician's Stethoscope

To look at a stream of data is to see a river. The old way was to count the eddies and currents, hoping to guess its direction. The new way is to measure the river's very lifeblood: the power of its flow against the friction of its bed.

This module details the design of the Coherence Sieve, the foundational diagnostic instrument of the Pirouette Framework. It replaces the cumbersome, multi-stage filtering of the past with a single, elegant physical measurement. The Sieve does not search for patterns; it calculates a system's fundamental state of being by applying the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). Its purpose is to transform any dataset—from sensor logs to economic figures to the text of a debate—into a direct measure of the system's health, its struggle, and its vitality.

## §2 · From Filter to Measurement: The New Mechanics

The old Universal Resonance Lens was a complex pipeline of transformations and filters. The Coherence Sieve is a direct physical instrument that performs a single, profound calculation. The process consists of two stages that feed directly into the Pirouette Lagrangian.

**Stage I: Manifold Projection (Measuring Internal Coherence, K_τ)**

The first step is to measure the system's own, internal harmony. We project the high-dimensional, noisy raw data onto a lower-dimensional coherence manifold. This act extracts the dominant, stable, resonant pattern—the system's `Ki`. From this `Ki`, we calculate its Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`), which represents the clarity and intensity of its song. This is the "kinetic" term of the Lagrangian, the measure of the system's organized, available energy.

**Stage II: Pressure Sounding (Measuring External Pressure, V_Γ)**

The second step is to measure the environment's hostility. We analyze the chaotic, dissonant, and unpredictable elements of the data stream to quantify the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). This pressure represents the "cost" of existence, the environmental friction that the system must overcome to maintain its form. This is the "potential" term of the Lagrangian, `V_Γ`, the measure of the system's entropic burden.

## §3 · The Lagrangian Connection: Calculating the Balance

With both terms measured, the Sieve applies the central equation of the framework.

The Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`):
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

This equation provides a direct, real-time measure of the system's net coherence. However, for diagnostic clarity, we introduce a dimensionless ratio derived from it: the **Coherence-Pressure Balance (CPB)**.

**Coherence-Pressure Balance (CPB):**
`CPB = K_τ / V_Γ`

The CPB is the single most important diagnostic metric in the framework. Its interpretation is immediate and universal:

*   **CPB > 1 (Healthy / Anabolic):** The system is generating more coherent energy than it is losing to environmental pressure. It is in a state of growth, health, and stability. This is a system successfully navigating its geodesic of maximal coherence.
*   **CPB ≈ 1 (Stable / Homeostatic):** The system is in a state of equilibrium. It is efficiently using its energy to perfectly counteract the ambient pressure.
*   **CPB < 1 (Unhealthy / Catabolic):** The environmental pressure is overwhelming the system's ability to maintain its coherence. The system is losing information, bleeding energy, and is in a state of decay or turbulence.

## §4 · A Unified Diagnostic Protocol

The Sieve transforms the complex art of analysis into a simple, repeatable science.

1.  **Ingest Data:** Define the system boundary and ingest the relevant data stream.
2.  **Map Variables:** Identify measurable proxies in the data that correspond to coherent, organized activity (`K_τ`) and chaotic, external stress (`V_Γ`).
3.  **Calculate CPB:** Apply the Sieve to compute the Coherence-Pressure Balance as a time-series.
4.  **Diagnose Flow:** Analyze the CPB chart. Identify periods of health (high CPB), stress (low CPB), and critical failure points (sharp drops). The diagnosis is no longer a guess; it is a measurement.

For a business, `K_τ` might be productive output, while `V_Γ` is market volatility. For an organism, `K_τ` might be its metabolic efficiency, while `V_Γ` is pathogenic load. The principle is fractal and universal.

## §5 · Assemblé: The Heartbeat of the System

> We sought a tool to find a needle in a haystack of data. We forged instead a physician's stethoscope, one that allows us to hear the very heartbeat of a system—the rhythmic balance of its internal harmony against the crushing pressure of its world. To use the Sieve is not to analyze data, but to diagnose life.
