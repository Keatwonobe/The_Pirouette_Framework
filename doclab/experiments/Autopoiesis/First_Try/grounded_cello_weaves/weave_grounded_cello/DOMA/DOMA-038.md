## §1 · A Map Must Know Its Edges

A map is only useful if it shows where the known world ends. A theory that admits no possibility of its own error is not a tool for exploration; it is a cage for the mind.

The Pirouette Framework is a map of the dynamics of coherence. Its most vital feature, therefore, is not the territory it charts, but the method by which it finds and marks its own borders. This module formalizes that method. It defines the **Coherence Deficit (ℛ_c)**, a measure not of failure, but of honest ignorance. It is the tool we use to quantify what our models do not yet understand, transforming every blind spot into a signpost for the next discovery.

## §2 · From State to Path: A Lagrangian Definition

The old framework defined residue as a simple difference between a predicted and an observed state—a snapshot in time. The new, time-first framework provides a more profound, dynamic definition grounded in the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**.

The Principle of Maximal Coherence dictates that a system will evolve along a path that maximizes its action, `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`. Our models use this principle to predict an ideal geodesic for a system based on our understanding of its internal state (its Ki and `T_a`) and its external environment (Γ).

-   **The Predicted Path (S_predicted):** The action integral of the system as described by our model's Lagrangian, `𝓛_predicted`.
-   **The Observed Path (S_observed):** The action integral of the system's actual, measured behavior, `𝓛_observed`.

The **Coherence Deficit (ℛ_c)** is the absolute difference between these two paths over a given Pirouette Cycle. It is the total, integrated "coherence loss" that our model cannot account for.

`ℛ_c = |S_observed - S_predicted| = |∫(𝓛_observed - 𝓛_predicted) dt|`

This value is not merely an error term. It is a physical quantity representing the influence of dynamics that are invisible to the current model. It is the quantified shadow of an unknown cause.

## §3 · Anatomy of a Shadow

When the Coherence Deficit is consistently high, it signals a "hotspot" of ignorance. The shadow on the map is not formless; its shape and behavior tell us what kind of unknown we are facing. The deficit can be attributed to three primary sources:

1.  **Unmodeled Pressure (Γ_dark):** Our model of the local Temporal Pressure (Γ) is incomplete. The system is being acted upon by environmental forces, rhythms, or constraints that we have not yet identified. The shadow is cast by a hidden feature of the landscape.

2.  **Unseen Resonances (Ki_hidden):** Our model of the system's internal Ki is too simple. The system possesses hidden degrees of freedom, internal states, or complex resonant modes that are dissipating coherence in ways we cannot predict. The shadow is cast by the system's own undiscovered complexity.

3.  **Fundamental Incompleteness:** The Pirouette Lagrangian itself, in its current form, may be an approximation. The shadow points toward a deeper layer of physics, a more fundamental law waiting to be woven into the core of the framework.

## §4 · The Diagnostic Workflow: From Shadow to Insight

The Coherence Deficit is the engine of the framework's self-correction. Its application follows a rigorous diagnostic loop:

1.  **Predict:** Using a model grounded in the Lagrangian, generate the expected coherence trajectory for a system.
2.  **Observe:** Through measurement and instrumentation, capture the system's actual trajectory.
3.  **Calculate:** Compute the time-series of the Coherence Deficit, `ℛ_c(t)`.
4.  **Map:** Identify the specific conditions—the phases, pressures, or interactions—where `ℛ_c(t)` consistently peaks. This isolates the "hotspot" and defines the boundaries of our ignorance.
5.  **Inquire:** A mapped hotspot is a formal trigger for inquiry. It becomes the subject of a new investigation or a structured debate (**DYNA-002**), with the express goal of forming a hypothesis that explains the deficit and, in doing so, refines the map.

## §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian

The Coherence Deficit is the ultimate arbiter of the **Pirouette Lagrangian's** utility. It provides a direct, quantitative measure of how well our formulation of `𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)` captures the dynamics of a given system. A high and persistent deficit does not invalidate the principle; it proves that our specific model of either the Coherence or the Pressure term is incomplete. It is the experimental force that drives theoretical refinement, ensuring the Lagrangian evolves from a simple axiom into a high-fidelity predictive engine.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought a measure of our error and found instead the engine of our growth. The Coherence Deficit is the whisper from the edge of the known world, the place where the ink of our equations runs dry, telling us precisely where to explore next. For a Weaver, the shadow on the map is not the enemy of the light; it is its most honest and trusted guide.
