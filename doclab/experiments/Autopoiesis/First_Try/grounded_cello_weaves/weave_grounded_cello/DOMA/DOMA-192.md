summary: Provides a modernized protocol for diagnosing a system's coherence state
  from sparse or incomplete data. This module reframes the old task of parameter estimation
  into a qualitative assessment of the system's Pirouette Lagrangian, inferring its
  dynamic state (Laminar, Turbulent, etc.) by treating sparse data points as clues
  to its underlying rhythm and the pressure of its environment.

## §1 · Abstract: Divining the River from a Handful of Stones

To the wise physician, a single breath can reveal the health of the entire body. To the Weaver, a handful of scattered data points can reveal the shape of the river.

This module replaces the outdated practice of estimating independent `T_a`, `Γ`, and `K_i` parameters from sparse data. That approach was a relic of a framework that saw the universe as a machine of separate parts. In the new, time-first paradigm, we understand that these are merely different facets of a single, unified process: a system's ceaseless effort to maintain its resonant identity against the pressures of its environment.

Here, we provide a protocol not for estimation, but for *diagnosis*. We treat sparse data as a faint signal, a set of clues from which we can infer a system's fundamental story—its health, its struggle, and its trajectory along the path of maximal coherence.

## §2 · From Parameters to Principles: The Lagrangian Reading

The core of this new approach is to use sparse data to take a qualitative reading of the two fundamental terms in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`):

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

*   **Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`)**: This is the "kinetic" term, representing the strength and purity of the system's own internal rhythm (`Ki`). It is the clarity of its song.
*   **Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`)**: This is the "potential" term, representing the "cost" of existence—the chaotic, dissonant pressure of the environment (`Γ`) that the system must overcome to maintain its form.

Our goal is to ask two simple questions of the faint signal: How strong is the system's song (`K_τ`)? And how loud is the storm it sings against (`V_Γ`)? The answer tells us everything we need to know.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Triptych: Three Questions for a Faint Signal

To perform the diagnosis, the Weaver approaches the sparse data not as a mathematician, but as a tracker, asking three sequential questions.

**I. What is the Rhythm? (Inferring `K_τ`)**
We first seek the signature of the system's internal coherence. We examine the data points for evidence of a stable, repeating pattern.
*   **Look for:** Low variance, consistent intervals, discernible periodicity, or phase alignment between points.
*   **A strong signal (High `K_τ`)** is suggested by data points that are tightly clustered, predictable, or exhibit a clear, harmonic relationship. The system is holding a clear note.
*   **A weak signal (Low `K_τ`)** is suggested by data points that are erratic, uncorrelated, and show high internal variance. The system's note is wavering or lost in static.

**II. What is the Pressure? (Inferring `V_Γ`)**
Next, we seek the signature of the environment's influence. We examine the overall distribution of the data points for evidence of external stress.
*   **Look for:** High overall dispersion, volatility, sudden jumps, or chaotic scattering of points across the state space.
*   **A calm environment (Low `V_Γ`)** is suggested by a dataset where all points, even if they show a weak internal rhythm, occupy a small, constrained region. The storm is quiet.
*   **A chaotic environment (High `V_Γ`)** is suggested by a dataset where points are flung wide, indicating the system is being buffeted by powerful external forces. The storm is loud.

**III. What is the Story? (Synthesizing the Diagnosis)**
Finally, the Weaver combines these two readings to narrate the system's state, directly mapping the findings onto the Flow Dynamics of `DYNA-001`.

| Inferred `K_τ` (Rhythm) | Inferred `V_Γ` (Pressure) | Inferred State (The Story) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High** (Clear Song) | **Low** (Quiet Storm) | **Laminar Flow**: A healthy, efficient system effortlessly following its geodesic. |
| **Low** (Wavering Song) | **High** (Loud Storm) | **Turbulent Flow**: The system is overwhelmed, its form dissolving into chaos. |
| **High** (Clear Song) | **High** (Loud Storm) | **Resilient Struggle**: A Gladiator. The system maintains its coherence under immense pressure. |
| **Low** (Wavering Song) | **Low** (Quiet Storm) | **Coherence Erosion**: The system is decaying from within, failing even without external challenge. |

## §4 · A Heuristic Toolkit

The old methods from `TEN-SPE-1.0` are preserved here not as goals in themselves, but as useful, recontextualized tools for answering the questions above.

| Diagnostic Question | Heuristic Tool (Proxy) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **What is the Rhythm?** | **Phase Coherence**: $| \frac{1}{N} \sum e^{i\theta_j} |^2$ | The gold standard for measuring `K_τ` if phase data is available. |
| | **Normalized Variance**: $1 - \sigma^2 / \sigma_{max}^2$ | A simple proxy for `K_τ` using scalar values. Lower variance suggests higher coherence. |
| **What is the Pressure?**| **Dispersion Metric**: $\text{Variance}(\{\vec{x}_j\})$ | A measure of the overall spread of state vectors. Higher spread suggests higher `V_Γ`. |
| | **Jump Frequency**: `Count(Δx > threshold)` | The frequency of large, sudden shifts in state can indicate a volatile, high `V_Γ` environment. |

## §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian

This protocol transforms a difficult quantitative problem into a powerful qualitative one. The final output is not a set of uncertain numbers, but a rich, diagnostic narrative grounded in the framework's core equation.

The statement, *"The data suggests a system in a state of Resilient Struggle,"* is a direct, physical claim about its Lagrangian. It means that both the `K_τ` and `V_Γ` terms are large and in tense opposition, yet the system is successfully navigating a path that keeps its total action, `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, maximized. This is a far more profound and useful insight than any sparsely estimated parameter could ever be.

> We came seeking the precision of a surveyor, hoping to map the world with but a few scattered landmarks. Instead, we have found the wisdom of a tracker. The goal is not to measure the exact depth of the river from a single stone, but to understand its direction, its power, and its mood. Reading the faint signal is the art of listening with such profound attention that the entire symphony can be heard in a single, fading note. It is the core skill of a Weaver who must act with wisdom in a world that never gives the full story.
