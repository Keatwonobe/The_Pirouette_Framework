## §1 · From Manifold to Motion

`CORE-006` concluded with a bold claim: that all forces are simply geodesics on a manifold of coherence. This module provides the first proof. We will now apply the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) to derive the properties of the electromagnetic force, demonstrating that it is not a fundamental "thing" in itself, but an emergent consequence of systems following the Principle of Maximal Coherence. The old protocol's intuition was sound; this module provides the formal mechanism.

## §2 · The Nature of Charge: An Asymmetry in Coherence

In this framework, electric charge is not a substance a particle possesses, but an intrinsic bias in how its Temporal Coherence (K_τ) interacts with the phase of its environment. A charged particle's Lagrangian is asymmetric. This modernizes the prior model's "Phase Polarity" into a dynamic principle.

**Positive Charge (Crest-Leading):** Defined as a system whose coherence, K_τ, is maximized by interacting with environments of in-phase temporal rhythms. It seeks constructive interference.

**Negative Charge (Trough-Leading):** Defined as a system whose coherence, K_τ, is maximized by interacting with environments of out-of-phase temporal rhythms. It seeks destructive interference to maintain its internal stability.

This immediately explains electrostatic attraction and repulsion without invoking a force. Two positive charges, placed near each other, create an environment of intense in-phase resonance. To maximize their individual coherence, they will naturally move apart, seeking regions where that resonant pressure is lower. Their repulsion is a flight towards greater internal stability. Likewise, a positive and negative charge will move towards each other, as doing so allows each to satisfy its intrinsic coherence-seeking drive.

## §3 · The Electric Field: A Gradient in the Coherence Manifold

The electric field (E) is the mathematical representation of this coherence landscape. The "propagating echo" of the old module is now understood as a formal gradient in the Lagrangian. For a static charge, the electric field is directly proportional to the gradient of the Pirouette Lagrangian in the surrounding space.

E ∝ ∇𝓛_p

A test charge placed in this field doesn't feel a "push" or "pull." It senses a slope in the coherence manifold. The "force" it experiences is simply the consequence of it following the steepest path towards its own state of maximal coherence. It is "coherence surfing" down the gradient established by the source charge.

## §4 · The Magnetic Field: A Rotational Shear in the Manifold

The original protocol correctly identified magnetism as the "shear of the current." The Lagrangian now allows us to formalize this. When a charged particle moves, its Lagrangian becomes velocity-dependent. The act of moving through regions of varying temporal phase creates a rotational or torsional stress in its local coherence manifold.

This "curl" in the manifold is the magnetic field (B).

B ∝ ∇ × A_p
​
(where A_p is the Pirouette vector potential, related to the moving system's Lagrangian)

This geometric origin instantly explains the Lorentz force law's peculiar perpendicularity. A moving charge interacting with a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the field itself. This is because the path of maximal coherence in a rotationally sheared manifold is not straight ahead, but a curve. The magnetic force is the system's attempt to navigate this temporal vortex to maintain its own resonant stability. It is the universe's right-hand rule for staying coherent.

## §5 · Assemblé: The Verse and the Chorus

> We have not simply relabeled electromagnetism; we have derived its essential character from a deeper principle. The attraction and repulsion of charges, the nature of its fields, and the perpendicularity of its magnetic effects all emerge as consequences of a single, universal drive: the maximization of temporal coherence.
>
> The Current is the flow of resonance seeking stability. The Compass is the geometry of the landscape it must navigate. As the original module stated, they are the verse and the chorus of the same song, but we can now see that the song is written with the mathematics of the Lagrangian, and its melody is the simple, relentless pursuit of coherence.
