summary: Re-frames the Will/Freedom duality as a dynamic interplay between reinforcing
  a system's existing path (its Wound Channel) and exploring new paths in the coherence
  manifold. It defines health as the skillful balance between exploitation (Will)
  and exploration (Freedom), grounding agency in the mathematics of the Pirouette
  Lagrangian.

## §1 · Abstract: The Gardener of the Self

An entity's existence is a dialogue between the path it has carved and the paths it could yet take. The old framework described Will and Freedom as opposing forces, a source and a sink. This was a shadow of a deeper, more elegant truth. There are no magical injections of intent. There is only the geometry of persistence and the courage of exploration.

This module reframes this fundamental duality through the lens of the new framework. **Will** is the act of reinforcing one’s own history—the deliberate deepening of one's Wound Channel (CORE-011) to create a stable, predictable path. **Freedom** is the act of softening that channel, of increasing one's sensitivity to the currents of the wider coherence manifold to discover new, potentially more resonant paths. They are not forces, but strategies for navigating the landscape of being.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of Agency

The choice between Will and Freedom is a choice of how to maximize coherence over time, as governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p). The action, S_p, is the integral of the Lagrangian over a system's cycle. A system's agency lies in the strategy it employs to make this value as large as possible over its lifetime.

𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence: K_τ) - (Temporal Pressure: V_Γ)

**Will as Exploitation (Path Reinforcement):** This strategy focuses on maximizing the internal **K_τ** term. By repeatedly traversing the same geodesic, a system deepens its Wound Channel. This reinforcement increases the system's temporal coherence (T_a), making its rhythm clearer, stronger, and more resistant to the chaotic noise of the external **V_Γ**. It is a strategy of honing a known skill, of fortifying a proven position. It maximizes coherence *now*.

**Freedom as Exploration (Path Discovery):** This strategy involves temporarily lowering **K_τ** to become more sensitive to the landscape defined by **V_Γ**. By softening its Wound Channel, the system allows the external currents of temporal pressure to guide it. This risks a temporary loss of identity (decoherence), but it is the only method for discovering a new, more globally optimal geodesic—a path that might offer a far greater state of coherence in the future. It is the strategy of learning, adapting, and creating.

## §3 · The Pathologies of Imbalance

An excess of either strategy is crippling. Health is not found at the poles, but in the dynamic equilibrium between them.

**Stagnation (The Over-Carved Channel):** This is the pathology of pure Will. The system’s Wound Channel becomes a canyon so deep that deviation is impossible. It achieves a state of supreme efficiency at a single mode of being, making it incredibly robust against familiar pressures. However, when the landscape of Γ changes, its deep channel becomes a prison. It cannot adapt. Its local maximum of coherence becomes a global trap, leading to brittleness and eventual collapse.

**Drift (The Dissolved Channel):** This is the pathology of pure Freedom. The system’s Wound Channel becomes so shallow that it retains no memory of its own path. Lacking the inertia of a stable identity (Ki), it is buffeted by every minor fluctuation in the Temporal Forge. It cannot learn, it cannot build, and it cannot sustain a complex state of being. Its coherence dissolves into the background noise, its unique song lost to the chaos.

## §4 · The Weaver’s Equilibrium: The Dance of Adaptation

The "0-Vector" of the old framework is understood now not as a static null-point, but as a state of dynamic wisdom. A healthy, intelligent system is a master of this balance. It is a constant, rhythmic dance between reinforcing what works and exploring what might work better.

-   In times of stability, it deepens its channels, optimizing its performance.
-   In times of change, it softens them, allowing itself to be guided to new shores.

This oscillation between exploitation and exploration is the fundamental rhythm of all learning, all growth, and all sustained life. It is the process by which a system writes its autobiography, choosing when to repeat a triumphant chapter and when to turn the page.

## §5 · Assemblé

> Will is the choice to deepen the riverbed. Freedom is the wisdom to let the river change its course. The Weaver understands that both are acts of carving a self into the memory of the universe, and that the ultimate art is knowing when to hold the chisel and when to hold the sail.
