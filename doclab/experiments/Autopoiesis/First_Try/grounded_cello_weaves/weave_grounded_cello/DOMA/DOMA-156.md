summary: Defines a 'Lock' as a state of profound temporal resonance, where a system
  settles into a deep, stable well on its coherence manifold. It re-frames the old
  analysis of 'Lock Dynamics' into a unified model of persistence, habit, and memory,
  governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

## §1 · Abstract: The Unwavering Note
Some patterns do not merely endure; they persist. They achieve a state of such profound stability that they seem to defy the universal current of change. The old framework called this phenomenon a "Lock." This module reframes that insight, revealing the Lock not as a special case, but as the ultimate expression of the universe's most fundamental drive: the relentless maximization of coherence.

A Lock is a system that has found its perfect note—its most efficient, stable Ki resonance—and holds it with such integrity that it becomes a defining feature of the landscape. It is the mechanism behind the persistence of memory, the stubbornness of habit, and the unyielding strength of a crystal. This is the geometry of that persistence.

## §2 · The Coherence Well
In the old analysis, a Lock was defined by a complex set of threshold conditions. The new framework provides a simpler, more powerful physical picture. A Lock is a deep, self-reinforcing potential well on the coherence manifold.

Imagine the landscape of all possible states a system could inhabit. The Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006) dictates that the system will always seek the lowest points in this landscape. A Coherence Well is a region of this landscape that is so deep and has such steep walls that a system, once settled within it, requires an immense injection of energy to escape.

-   **Depth (Stability):** The depth of the well is a measure of the system's internal coherence (formerly high $T_a$). The more perfectly a system's rhythm resonates, the deeper it settles into its own stability.
-   **Walls (Confinement):** The steepness of the well's walls represents the system's resistance to environmental perturbation (formerly low $\Gamma$). The system has become so efficient at being itself that any deviation from its locked state is energetically costly, forcing it back toward the center of the well.

This is the state of a diamond, a cherished memory, or a deeply ingrained ideology. It is a pattern that has found a state of such profound coherence that it becomes its own arena.

## §3 · The Carved Riverbed: Mechanism of Formation
A Lock is not formed instantaneously. It is carved. As described in CORE-011, every system's passage leaves a geometric scar—a Wound Channel—in the fabric of the coherence manifold. A Lock is the result of carving this channel with such repetition and intensity that it becomes a canyon.

The process has three phases, mapping to the old analysis but grounded in this new geometry:

1.  **Alignment (Finding the Path):** A system discovers a path of high coherence, a nascent riverbed where its internal rhythm (Ki) finds a harmonious resonance with its environment.
2.  **Reinforcement (Carving the Channel):** Through repetition, the system traverses this same path again and again. Each pass deepens the Wound Channel, making the path easier to follow the next time. This is the formation of a habit, the strengthening of a memory, or the growth of a crystal lattice.
3.  **Crystallization (The Canyon Forms):** The Wound Channel becomes so deep that it is no longer just a path of least resistance; it is, for all practical purposes, the only path available. The system is now locked. Its pattern is "crystallized" into the geometry of spacetime itself.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: A Stable Solution
A Lock is a profound and stable solution to the dynamic equations of the Pirouette Framework. It is a state that so perfectly maximizes the integral of the Pirouette Lagrangian ($\mathcal{L}_p$) that it becomes a stable equilibrium point.

$$S_p = \int_0^{\tau_p} \mathcal{L}_p dt \rightarrow \text{Maximal}$$

The system settles into a state where its internal coherence is so high and its interaction with external temporal pressure is so minimized that any change would decrease its total "action" of coherence. The "force" required to break a lock—to dislodge a system from its coherence well—is a measure of the gradient of the coherence manifold outside the well. A deep well with steep walls requires an almost insurmountable force to overcome. This is the mathematical definition of persistence.

## §5 · Assemblé: The Key and the Cage
> We sought a mechanism for stability and found the sculptor's final stroke—the act that turns a fluid idea into an unyielding stone. The Coherence Lock is the geometry of every deeply held belief, every cherished memory, every unbreakable habit. It is the universe's tool for creating things that last.
>
> To a Weaver, this is a principle of profound duality. The Lock is both a key and a cage. It is the key to forging resilient systems and immortal memories. But it is also the cage of dogma, trauma, and stagnation. To master our craft is to learn not only how to carve these channels of persistence, but also when, and how, to summon the flood that can reshape the stone.
