## §1 · Abstract: The Ascent to Grace

This instrument provides the primary method for analyzing the stability and evolution of any system within the Pirouette Framework. It fundamentally reframes the legacy approach of "Gladiator Force Gradient Mapping" by replacing the classical concept of a potential energy landscape with the **Coherence Landscape**.

In the old view, systems were seen as marbles rolling downhill to find points of minimum energy—stable, but lifeless, valleys. This instrument recasts that picture entirely. Systems are not seeking rest; they are striving for expression. They evolve by climbing a landscape of coherence, seeking peaks of elegant, stable, and efficient resonance. This tool does not map the geography of a system's rest; it maps the geography of its potential for grace.

## §2 · From Potential Wells to Coherence Peaks

The core of this modernization is a paradigm shift in the objective function of reality itself, grounded in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`).

*   **The Old Law (Energy Minimization):** A system seeks the lowest point in a potential energy landscape `V`. The force is one of descent: `F = -∇V`. Attractors are valleys.
*   **The New Law (Coherence Maximization):** A system seeks the highest point in its Coherence Landscape, defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian `𝓛_p`. The "force" is one of ascent toward greater expression: `F_p ∝ ∇𝓛_p`. Attractors are peaks.

The **Gladiator Force** (`CORE-008`), previously modeled as the source of a confining potential, is now correctly understood as a powerful, self-referential feedback loop that contributes to the **Temporal Pressure** term (`V_Γ`) of the Lagrangian. The system's own resonance forges the very walls of the arena it must navigate.

## §3 · The Mapper's Protocol: A Four-Step Ascent

To map a system's Coherence Landscape, the Weaver follows a rigorous, four-step protocol.

**Step I: Define the State Space.**
Identify the key parameters (`x`) that define the system's configuration. This could be anything from the spatial coordinates of particles to the strategic variables of a business or the emotional states of a person. This defines the "ground" upon which the landscape will be drawn.

**Step II: Translate to Pirouette Fields.**
This is the critical act of application. For each point `x` in the state space, the Weaver must determine the two components of the Pirouette Lagrangian:
*   **Temporal Coherence (`K_τ(x)`):** The "kinetic" term. This is a measure of the system's internal harmony, efficiency, and resonant purity when in configuration `x`. It is the *reward* for being in that state.
*   **Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ(x)`):** The "potential" term. This is a measure of the environmental and self-induced stress, chaos, and dissonance the system must overcome to maintain configuration `x`. It is the *cost* of being in that state.

**Step III: Construct the Coherence Landscape.**
With the fields defined, the landscape is generated by calculating the value of the Pirouette Lagrangian at every point in the space:
`𝓛_p(x) = K_τ(x) - V_Γ(x)`
This scalar field `𝓛_p(x)` *is* the Coherence Landscape.

**Step IV: Navigate the Landscape.**
The final step is to analyze the landscape's geometry to understand the system's dynamics:
*   **Identify Attractors:** Locate the local maxima of `𝓛_p(x)`. These peaks are the system's stable or metastable states—its points of highest efficiency and most elegant resonance.
*   **Map the Paths of Evolution:** Calculate the gradient field `∇𝓛_p(x)`. The vectors of this field point "uphill," showing the path of steepest ascent. This is the geodesic of maximal coherence, the most probable evolutionary path for the system.

## §4 · Lagrangian Integration

This instrument is the direct, practical implementation of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** as formalized in `CORE-006`. The entire procedure is an exercise in applying the formula `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ` to a concrete problem. By mapping this function, we move from a philosophical principle to a predictive, computational engine. The Mapper is the tool that makes the Lagrangian speak.

## §5 · Output & Interpretation

The output of the Coherence Landscape Mapper is a rich, multi-layered understanding of the system's inner world:

*   **The Landscape Map:** A topographic map of `𝓛_p`, visualizing the system's "islands of stability" and "chasms of chaos."
*   **The Attractor Catalog:** A ranked list of the landscape's peaks, identifying the system's most preferred, coherent, and resilient configurations.
*   **The Coherence Gradient Field:** A vector map illustrating the natural "currents" of change, predicting how the system will respond to perturbations and where it will evolve if left to its own devices.

This provides the Weaver with not only a diagnosis of the system's current state but a clear prognosis for its future and a strategic guide for any desired intervention.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We used to map the world by its shadows, charting the valleys where things came to rest. It was a cartography of endings. Now, we learn to read the light. We chart the peaks, the places of clearest reception, where a system's song rings truest against the noise of the world. This is not a map of where a thing will die, but a map of where it most truly learns to live.
