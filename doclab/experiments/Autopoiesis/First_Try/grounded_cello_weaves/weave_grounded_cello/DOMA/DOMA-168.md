## §1 · Abstract: The Architect of the Future
A plan is not a map of a river that already exists. A plan is the architect's blueprint for the riverbed itself, carved into the landscape of possibility before the first drop of water begins to flow.

This module refactors the analysis of planning from a static assessment of components into a dynamic, time-first model. It discards the notion of a plan as a document to be followed and re-envisions it as an active, resonant projection of will. A plan is a *proposed geodesic*—a hypothesized path of maximal coherence—designed to guide a system from its present state to a desired future state with the least possible friction. Its success is not measured by its rigidity, but by the quality of the channel it carves for the future flow of action.

## §2 · The Plan as a Coherence Imprint
The old framework correctly identified that a plan creates a "forward wound channel." In the modern framework, we can define this with greater precision. A plan is an act of deliberate *coherence imprinting*. It is an application of the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010), cast forward in time.

By defining goals, allocating resources, and sequencing actions, the planner imposes a coherent geometric structure onto the future manifold. This pre-carved Wound Channel (CORE-011) creates a path of least resistance. The purpose of a good plan is to make the desired future the most "natural" and coherent path for action to follow.

## §3 · The Lagrangian of the Plan
To assess a plan's viability, we model it as a dynamic system governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). A plan is considered robust and effective if it maximizes the integral of its own Lagrangian over its intended duration.

**𝓛_plan = K_τ(plan) - V_Γ(environment)**

-   **Temporal Coherence of the Plan (K_τ):** This term represents the plan's internal power and integrity. It is the "kinetic energy" of the intent. High coherence arises from:
    -   **Clarity:** A sharply defined, unambiguous goal.
    -   **Consistency:** Internal logic where actions support goals and sub-goals do not conflict.
    -   **Alignment:** Resources, skills, and personnel are harmonically matched to the required tasks.
    A plan with high K_τ is a clear, powerful signal projected into the future.

-   **Environmental Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** This term represents the "potential energy" or the cost of executing the plan. It is the ambient chaos, friction, and resistance of the operational environment. High pressure arises from:
    -   **Uncertainty:** High market volatility, unpredictable events.
    -   **Competition:** The actions of other agents casting their own interfering shadows.
    -   **Constraints:** Scarcity of resources, regulatory hurdles.
    A plan facing high V_Γ must possess exceptionally high internal coherence (K_τ) to succeed.

A "good" plan is not just internally consistent; it is a resonant solution to its environment, finding the sweet spot of maximal coherence for minimal cost.

## §4 · The Fates of Execution: A Flow Dynamics Diagnosis
The true test of a plan is in its execution. We can diagnose the health of any ongoing plan by applying the lens of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001).

-   **Laminar Execution:** The plan is an accurate geodesic. Actions flow effortlessly toward the goal. The team is "in the zone," problems are solved smoothly, and progress feels natural and efficient. The pre-carved channel is deep and clear.

-   **Turbulent Execution:** The plan is misaligned with the true geodesic of the environment. Execution is chaotic, characterized by constant crises, rework, and "firefighting." Energy is wasted on internal friction rather than forward progress. The plan's signal is being drowned out by environmental noise.

-   **Stagnant Execution:** The plan is too rigid to navigate an unforeseen obstacle—a "coherence dam." Progress halts. This manifests as analysis paralysis, a critical bottleneck, or a project that is "stuck." The pre-carved channel has hit a mountain the architect did not see.

## §5 · Planning as a Verb: The Adaptive Geodesic
The most profound shift is from viewing a plan as a noun to understanding planning as a verb. A static plan is a fragile thing. A truly resilient strategy is an *adaptive geodesic*—a continuous process of sensing changes in the environmental pressure (Γ) and re-calculating the path of maximal coherence in real time.

This re-frames the concept of a "review cycle." It is not a periodic check-in, but a living feedback loop. The goal is not to adhere to the original plan, but to adhere to the *principle of maximal coherence*, dynamically adjusting the path to maintain a state of laminar flow toward the ultimate goal.

## §6 · Connection to the Lagrangian
This entire module is a direct, domain-specific application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). It replaces arbitrary metrics and checklists with the universe's own objective function. A plan's success is a direct function of its ability to embody the Principle of Maximal Coherence. By framing planning in this way, we move from making checklists to engineering the flow of time itself.

## §7 · Assemblé
> To plan is not to predict the future. It is to make the future predictable. It is the sacred and audacious act of imposing a coherent will upon the chaos of the yet-to-be, carving a channel of intent so clear and so deep that the river of what happens has no choice but to follow it.
