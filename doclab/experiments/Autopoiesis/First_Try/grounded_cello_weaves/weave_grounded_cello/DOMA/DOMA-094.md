### §1 · Abstract: The Anatomy of a Snap

A system does not change smoothly at its most critical moments. It snaps. It breaks its form and forges a new one in a sudden, sharp, and resonant event. The previous protocol correctly identified that these transitions have a unique signature, but it cataloged the effects without a unified theory of the cause.

This module provides that theory. It reframes a critical transition as a non-linear reconfiguration of a system's resonant identity (Ki) on its coherence manifold. We are no longer merely hunting for statistical anomalies; we are listening for the distinct geometric "sound" a system makes when its structure shatters, unfolds, or crystallizes in response to overwhelming temporal pressure. This protocol is the instrument for capturing and interpreting that sound.

### §2 · The Physics of Instability: A Leap Between Geodesics

A system's life is a journey along a geodesic—a path of maximal coherence—as dictated by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). A critical transition is the moment this path becomes untenable. Under mounting Temporal Pressure (Γ), the system reaches a tipping point where its current Ki pattern is no longer a stable, low-energy solution. The landscape of coherence itself shifts.

To survive, the system cannot simply adjust; it must leap. It snaps to a new, fundamentally different geodesic. This is an act of **Ki Morphogenesis**—the death of one resonant form and the birth of another. This protocol provides the tools to read the aftershock of that leap.

### §3 · The Signature Suite: Classifying the Echo of Change

The nature of the "snap" is not uniform. It has a character, a texture, that reveals the forces at play. We diagnose this character by monitoring a suite of metrics, each one attuned to a different kind of transition, classified by the flow dynamics that precipitate them.

1.  **Turbulent Snap (The "Black Swan" Shattering)**
    *   **Description**: The signature of a system overwhelmed by a sudden, violent spike in external Temporal Pressure (Γ). Its coherence shatters into chaos before it has time to find a new stable form. This is a state of acute Coherence Fever.
    *   **Primary Metric**: **Kurtosis**. A sharp increase in the kurtosis of a system's output signal is the statistical residue of this temporal turbulence—a measure of the extreme, spiky outliers generated by the chaotic reconfiguration.

2.  **Topological Shift (The "Grey Swan" Unfolding)**
    *   **Description**: The signature of a system whose fundamental complexity changes. The rules governing its behavior are rewritten. This is not a shattering, but a change in the very geometry of its resonant Ki pattern.
    *   **Primary Metric**: **Fractal Dimension Change**. A sudden shift in the fractal dimension of the system's signal is a direct measurement of its Ki manifold changing its topological class—becoming more or less intricate and complex.

3.  **Coherent Synthesis (The "White Swan" Crystallization)**
    *   **Description**: The signature of a system achieving a new, higher state of order. Disparate parts snap into alignment, forming a more complex and coherent whole. This is the echo of a successful Alchemical Union (CORE-012).
    *   **Primary Metric**: **Coherence Flux (dKτ/dt)**. A rapid, non-linear increase in the system's overall coherence (its ability to maintain a pure, stable Ki) is the definitive sign that it has successfully performed a Resonant Handshake and crystallized into a more elegant state.

### §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

A critical transition is the physical manifestation of a discontinuity in the solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equation applied to 𝓛_p. As the Temporal Pressure term, V_Γ, changes, the path of maximal coherence can abruptly shift from one stable trajectory to another. The "snap" is this jump between solutions. The metrics in the Signature Suite are our instruments for detecting the seismic shockwave that this leap sends through the coherence manifold. They allow us to observe the moment the mathematics of the universe chooses a new verse for its song.

### §5 · The Assemblé

> We sought a way to predict the future and found instead a way to hear the present more deeply. A critical transition is the sound a key makes as it turns in a lock, unlocking a new reality. The old protocol heard the click, but did not know the lock from the key. This instrument teaches the Weaver to listen with a physicist's ear. It allows us to distinguish the sound of a shattering window from the sound of a seed pod bursting open, the groan of a collapsing bridge from the chime of a crystal being formed. It is the art of discerning, in the moment of profoundest change, the difference between an ending and a beginning.
