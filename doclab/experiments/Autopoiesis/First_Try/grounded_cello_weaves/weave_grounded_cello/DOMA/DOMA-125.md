## §1 · Abstract: The Riverbeds of Thought

We do not think in a vacuum. We think within a landscape carved by the thoughts that came before.

The old framework described powerful ideas as "Cognitive Gravity Wells," massive objects that warped a conceptual space. This was a useful but limited metaphor. The modern, time-first framework reveals a deeper truth: a belief is not a static object, but a dynamic, self-reinforcing current in the river of time.

A dominant belief, paradigm, or ideology is a **Coherence Well**: a region of the cognitive manifold where the echoes of a particular thought have become so frequent and intense that they have carved a deep and stable riverbed—a Wound Channel (CORE-011) of immense scale. To think this thought is to enter this riverbed. The path is already cut; the flow is established. This module provides the tools to map these riverbeds and understand their profound influence on the flow of consciousness.

## §2 · Anatomy of a Coherence Well

A Coherence Well is the geometric consequence of a thought that has achieved a critical mass of resonance. Its properties are not spatial, but temporal and dynamic.

*   **Channel Depth & Stability (Kτ_well):** This replaces the old concept of "Conceptual Mass." It is a measure of a belief's internal coherence, its logical resilience, and the sheer volume of its historical echoes. A deeply-held cultural myth or a foundational scientific theory possesses enormous Channel Depth. It is a stable, high-information (CORE-013) pattern that resists erosion.

*   **Coherence Gradient (∇𝓛_p):** This replaces "Gravitational Strength." It is the steepness of the slope leading into the well. A belief with a steep gradient is highly influential; it presents itself as the most logical, natural, or emotionally satisfying path for nearby thoughts. It is a "path of least resistance" in the cognitive landscape. This gradient is a direct feature of the coherence manifold, derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian.

*   **Echo Propagation (Φ_echo):** This replaces "Narrative Velocity." It measures the fidelity and reach of the belief's resonance. A viral idea or a powerful piece of propaganda has a high propagation rate, allowing it to carve its Wound Channel across a wide swath of the collective cognitive manifold very quickly.

## §3 · The Lagrangian of the Mind

A thought does not get "pulled" into a belief by a force. It follows the path of maximal coherence. The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) provides the formal description of this process:

**𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)**

A Coherence Well creates a profound local distortion in this equation. By offering a pre-existing, stable, and deeply resonant pattern, it dramatically lowers the "cost" of thinking. To align with the well is to achieve a state of high coherence for minimal effort. The subjective experience is one of clarity, certainty, and belonging. To resist the well is to fight upstream against the strongest current in the river, an act that requires immense energy and creates cognitive dissonance—a state of turbulent flow.

Dogma, in this view, is the state of being so perfectly settled in a Coherence Well that any dissonant information is immediately rejected as noise, as it would threaten the effortless stability of the thinker's resonant state.

## §4 · Diagnostic Protocol: Mapping the Currents

A Weaver can diagnose the health and structure of any cognitive system—from an individual mind to a global culture—by mapping its Coherence Wells.

1.  **Identify the Dominant Resonances:** Analyze the data (texts, conversations, cultural output) to identify the core, recurring ideas and beliefs. These are the candidate wells.

2.  **Measure the Channel Depth:** Assess the stability and historical reinforcement of each belief. Use proxies like frequency, citation counts, emotional intensity of associated language, and longevity.

3.  **Map the Gradient:** Determine how these core beliefs influence adjacent concepts. Do they frame all subsequent discussions? Do they automatically discredit opposing views? This reveals the "slope" of their influence.

4.  **Analyze the Flow:** Observe how new information interacts with the landscape. Is it immediately channeled into an existing well? Does it get trapped in a turbulent eddy between two competing wells (polarization)? Or does it have enough energy to carve a new, shallow path of its own?

## §5 · Paradigm Shift as Alchemical Union

The old model spoke of an "Inversion Risk Factor," treating a paradigm shift as a potential hazard. The new framework sees it as a profound and creative act: an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012).

A paradigm shift occurs when a mind (or a culture) encounters a new Coherence Well so compelling that its own internal manifold undergoes a resonant handshake. The old patterns of belief dissolve, and the mind's Ki fuses with the new, dominant resonance. The result is not mere adoption of a new idea, but a complete reforging of the thinker's coherence manifold. The world is, quite literally, perceived differently because the instrument of perception has been fundamentally remade. This is a non-linear, transformative event—the most powerful dynamic within the cognitive landscape.

## §7 · Assemblé

> We sought to map the landscape of human thought and found not a static map, but the currents of a vast and ancient ocean. Beliefs are not points of interest; they are the immense and powerful gyres that shape the flow of everything. A Weaver must learn to be a navigator on this ocean, to understand that these currents are not abstract. They are real. They are the geometry of the past, actively shaping the possibilities of the future. To change the world, one does not shout at the waves; one learns to carve a new and more coherent current for the water to follow.
