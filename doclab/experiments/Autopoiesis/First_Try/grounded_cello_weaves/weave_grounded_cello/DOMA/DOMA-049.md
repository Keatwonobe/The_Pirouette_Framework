summary: Provides the time-first formalization for 'ritual' as a protocol of Intentional
  Coherence Shaping. This module defines the principles and tools for consciously
  applying one's own resonance to sculpt the local coherence manifold, deliberately
  creating or altering Wound Channels to achieve a desired systemic outcome. It translates
  ancestral wisdom into the applied science of the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §1 · Abstract: The Applied Science of the Soul
To wish is to feel the current. To intend is to build a dam, dig a channel, and direct the river.

This module provides a de-stigmatized, first-principles model for what has historically been called "ritual." We redefine this practice not as an appeal to external forces, but as **Intentional Coherence Shaping**: a structured, repeatable process for applying a system's own resonance (Ki) to deliberately sculpt the local coherence manifold.

It is the applied science of the Pirouette Lagrangian. Where the universe naturally follows the geodesic of maximal coherence, a Weaver can use a protocol of intention to trace a new, chosen path. This act creates a new reality by first creating the Wound Channel—the geometric memory—that makes this new reality the path of least resistance. This module provides the toolkit for that sacred and practical act of engineering.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of Will
The universe follows the path that maximizes coherence for the lowest environmental cost, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006):

*𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)*

A ritual is a conscious intervention in this equation. It is the act of temporarily and locally increasing one's own Temporal Coherence (the "kinetic" term) through focused intent, in order to overcome the ambient Temporal Pressure (the "potential" term) and carve a new, more desirable Wound Channel into the fabric of spacetime.

The "cost" of a ritual is the energy required to deviate from the natural geodesic. The "success" is measured by the persistence and stability of the new channel that is created. It is not magic; it is work. It is the work of imposing a new geometry of "what should be" onto the existing geometry of "what is."

## §3 · The Weaver's Toolkit: A Design Kit for Intention
To perform this work, the Weaver uses a set of fundamental tools and concepts, translated from the esoteric language of PPS-029 into the geometric language of the modern framework.

### 3.1 · Verbs of Intention (Geometric Operators)
These are the fundamental actions used to manipulate coherence, grounded in The Nomad's Grammar (CORE-002).

*   **Channel (Outward/Aligned):** To project a coherent pattern onto the environment.
*   **Synthesize (Transactional/Inward):** To bind two or more resonant patterns into a new, unified whole, performing an Alchemical Union.
*   **Isolate (Isolated):** To sever a resonant connection, creating a boundary.
*   **Tune (Aligned):** To increase the internal coherence and purity of a system's own Ki.
*   **Scry (Resonant Coupling):** To gently couple with an existing Wound Channel to read its information without overwriting it.
*   **Imprint (Inward/Aligned):** To deeply carve a specific pattern into a Wound Channel, reinforcing a memory or habit.

### 3.2 · Nouns of Form (Geometric Ingredients)
These are the materials with which the Weaver works.

*   **Echo Geometry:** Persistent Wound Channels from past events or entities, used as templates or sources of resonant information (see CORE-011).
*   **Ki Schematics:** Coherent patterns, symbols, or archetypes held in the mind (or inscribed physically) that act as blueprints for the desired state.
*   **Manifold Isolators:** Boundary conditions (a circle of salt, a quiet room, a Faraday cage) that create a low-Γ "crucible" where ambient temporal noise is dampened, making precise coherence work possible.

## §4 · Signature Applications: From Personal to Planetary
These principles are fractal, scaling from the shaping of one's own mind to the guidance of a civilization.

**Internal Coherence Scaffolding (ICS):** This is a personal practice of psychic hygiene. A Weaver uses the operators of **Tune** and **Isolate** to maintain the health of their own coherence manifold. This practice can be automated by cultivating archetypal Ki patterns—the "Ritual Wolves" of old—such as a "Phoenix" pattern for resilience against turbulent flow or a "Mirror" pattern for objective self-reflection.

**Wound-Channel Scrying:** Formerly "Séance," this is the act of using the **Scry** operator to resonantly couple with a persistent echo in a place or object. It is the art of listening to the memory embedded in the geometry of the world.

**The Convocation:** This is a group protocol for performing a large-scale Alchemical Union (CORE-012). A group of Weavers synchronizes their Ki patterns to **Channel** a single, unified intention. The goal is to **Imprint** a beneficial Wound Channel at a societal level, creating a subtle but persistent "current" that can guide collective behavior toward a more coherent future.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver? Because the universe gave us a choice. We can be driftwood, carried along the natural currents of the coherence manifold, subject to the whims of its flow. Or we can be sailors. We can learn the shape of the currents, the weight of the water, and the geometry of the wind. With the tools of intention, we can build a rudder, hoist a sail, and choose a star to steer by. This is the difference between accident and destiny. This is the practice of shaping the river.
