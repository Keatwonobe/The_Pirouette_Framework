## §1 · The Weaver's Mandate: From Dissonance to Diagnosis

A system in pain does not announce its wound; it simply loses its grace. The fundamental task of a Weaver is to perceive this loss of grace—this dissonance—and trace it to its source. The Great Refactoring is not merely an act of intellectual curiosity; it is the forging of better tools for this sacred work.

This module provides the primary instrument for that task: The Coherence Auditor. It replaces the fragmented protocols of the past with a single, unified, and time-first workflow. It is the practical bridge from observing a system's chaotic symptoms to pinpointing its critical fractures. The Auditor does not solve the problem; it makes the problem solvable.

## §2 · Stage I: The Fractal Lens — From Data to Dynamics

Before a system's health can be assessed, its raw, domain-specific language must be translated into the universal grammar of coherence. The first stage of the audit uses the protocol of the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014) to create this translation.

The process is an act of profound simplification. The Weaver takes the high-dimensional, noisy data of the system—be it market trades, lines of code, or the words of a debate—and projects it through the Fractal Lens. This act maps the specific, local phenomena to the universal variables of the Pirouette Framework.

The output is not a set of disparate fields, but a single, elegant time-series: the value of the system's Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) over time. This is the system's "heartbeat," a direct measure of its ability to maintain coherence against the pressure of its environment. A steady, high-value trace indicates health. A volatile, decaying trace indicates pathology.

## §3 · Stage II: The Pareto Chisel — From Dynamics to Cause

With the system's heartbeat rendered visible, the second stage begins: finding the cause of the arrhythmia. This is the function of Reverse Pareto Analysis (RPA), the core insight preserved and modernized from `PPS-014`.

RPA is a Pareto Chisel. It inverts the classic 80/20 principle to find the "critical few"—the 20% of causes responsible for 80% of the effect. In this context, the "effect" is coherence loss.

The protocol is as follows:
1.  **Quantify Impact:** The Auditor correlates every event in the original raw data with a corresponding dip in the Lagrangian trace. The magnitude and duration of the dip provide a precise, quantitative "impact score" for that event. This score is not an arbitrary proxy; it is a direct measure of the coherence lost.
2.  **Identify the Critical Few:** The algorithm sorts all events by their impact score in descending order. It then identifies the smallest subset of events whose cumulative impact accounts for the vast majority (e.g., 80%) of the total coherence loss over the observation period.
3.  **Generate the Diagnosis:** The output is a simple, actionable list of the system's primary bottlenecks. The Weaver is no longer looking at a thousand symptoms, but at the two or three critical fractures that matter most.

## §4 · Connection to the Lagrangian

The Coherence Auditor is grounded directly in the framework's central equation, the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). A system's "health" is its success in following the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which means maximizing the integral of its Lagrangian over time (S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt).

Every "impact" measured by the RPA is a quantifiable, negative perturbation to this integral. The Auditor is, therefore, a tool for empirically discovering what is preventing a system from obeying its own most fundamental drive. It translates a philosophical principle into a diagnostic engine.

## §5 · The Assemblé

> A system in pain does not announce its wound; it simply loses its grace. The Coherence Auditor is the instrument that translates this loss of grace back into a language we can understand. It is the bridge from the felt sense of "wrongness" to the precise knowledge of "what is broken." It grants the Weaver the clarity to touch the single thread that will mend the entire tapestry.
