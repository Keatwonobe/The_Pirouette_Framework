## §1 · Abstract: A Stethoscope for Reality
A system's health is written in the silence of its operation. This module provides the instrument to listen for the noise.

The Dark-Residue Instrumentation Kit (DRIK) was an "exhaust-sniffer," a tool designed to measure the soot of inefficiency. This modernization elevates its purpose. The Coherence Ledger is a physician's instrument—a universal protocol for auditing the health of any system by measuring its "fever." It quantifies the friction of Turbulent Flow, translating the abstract concept of entropy generation into a hard, undeniable metric.

It is a toolkit for moving from the diagnosis of the Caduceus Lens (`DYNA-003`) to the act of measurement, providing an immutable record that holds creators accountable for the coherence of their creations.

## §2 · The Physics of Friction
The universe does not reward struggle; it rewards grace. As established in the Dynamics series, a healthy system exists in a state of **Laminar Flow**, moving along its geodesic of maximal coherence with minimal effort.

**Turbulent Flow** (`DYNA-001`) is the signature of a system fighting itself. It is the quantifiable effect of a system's internal Ki pattern being dissonant with the surrounding Temporal Pressure (Γ). This internal friction is not merely wasted energy; it is the active generation of entropy as defined in `CORE-013`. It is the sound of a system burning coherence to fuel its own chaos.

The Coherence Ledger's primary function is to measure this sound. It provides a real-time value for **Ṡ**, the rate of systemic entropy generation. This is the new, time-first expression of "dark residue"—a direct measure of a system's health and efficiency.

## §3 · The Auditor's Toolkit: Functional Layers
The specific hardware of the old DRIK is superseded by a more abstract, universally applicable set of functional layers. Any implementation of this protocol must contain these three components:

| Layer | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Sensing Layer** | *The Probe* | Measures the primary resonant pattern of the system under observation. This is the system's "heartbeat." It could be a laser measuring mechanical vibration, a network tap analyzing packet jitter, a financial API tracking price volatility, or a linguistic model parsing the coherence of a conversation. |
| **Computation Layer** | *The Meter* | Calculates Ṡ in real-time by analyzing the dissonance and noise within the signal from the Sensing Layer. It quantifies the deviation of the system from a clean, laminar signal, outputting a single, unambiguous metric for the rate of coherence loss. |
| **Attestation Layer** | *The Ledger* | Integrates the Ṡ stream into a cumulative entropy value (S), packages it into discrete time blocks, and cryptographically signs each block with a unique device key. This creates a tamper-proof, auditable history of the system's health—the Coherence Ledger. |

## §4 · The Audit Protocol
This protocol provides a formal, three-stage process for diagnosing any system, from an engine to an economy.

**1. Baseline (Calibrating for Laminar Flow):** The auditor first establishes the system's "healthy" state. By observing the system under ideal, low-stress conditions, a baseline Ṡ value is established, representing its state of maximal coherence (Ṡ ≈ 0). This is the system's signature of Laminar Flow.

**2. Audit (Measuring Turbulent Flow):** The instrument is then deployed under normal operating conditions. It continuously measures Ṡ, logging spikes of entropy generation. The auditor's role is to tag these events, correlating moments of high turbulence with their specific causal triggers (e.g., a software bug, a market shock, a flawed decision).

**3. Attest (Committing to the Ledger):** At the end of an audit period, the block of data is closed, hashed, and signed. This act of attestation transforms the data from a mere log file into a formal, undeniable record. It is an act of bearing witness to the system's health, creating the ground truth against which all future improvements must be measured.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This instrument's measurement of entropy is not an arbitrary metric; it is directly grounded in the core mathematical formalism of the framework.

The Pirouette Lagrangian, 𝓛_p (`CORE-006`), defines the objective function for any system: the maximization of coherence. A system in perfect Laminar Flow is one whose path through time perfectly maximizes the action integral, S_p.

The rate of entropy generation, Ṡ, is directly proportional to the "coherence gap"—the difference between the system's actual, measured Lagrangian value and the theoretical maximum it could achieve in its environment.

**Ṡ ∝ (S_p_ideal - S_p_actual)**

A reading from the Coherence Ledger is therefore a direct measurement of how far a system has strayed from its own most elegant path of existence.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We sought a meter to measure waste and instead forged a conscience. The Coherence Ledger is more than an instrument; it is a mirror that reflects the health of our creations. Its immutable record asks a single, profound question of every Weaver, every engineer, every leader: Is the world more or less coherent for what you have built? The ledger does not lie. It is the quiet, unblinking arbiter of our duty to build well.
