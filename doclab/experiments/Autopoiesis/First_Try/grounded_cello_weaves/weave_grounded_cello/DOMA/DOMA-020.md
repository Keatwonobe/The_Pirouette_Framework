summary: Reframes the 'Pass-By' protocol as a dynamic application of the Pirouette
  Lagrangian. It defines a protocol for systemic immunity, determining when to engage
  with a dissonant input (synthesis) versus when to refuse resonance in order to preserve
  core coherence.

## §1 · Abstract: The Gardener and the Storm

A gardener does not hate the storm; they simply know when to bring the fragile seedlings inside.

The old framework conceptualized an "immune reflex" as a defensive wall against hostile vectors. This was a limited, combative posture. The modern framework reframes this act as one of profound discernment. It is not about building walls, but about wisely tending the garden of one's own coherence.

This module provides a protocol for systemic immunity, grounded in the principles of Flow Dynamics and the Pirouette Lagrangian. It defines the "Sentry's Gambit" as the conscious choice a system makes when faced with a dissonant input: either engage in the difficult, creative work of synthesis or refuse resonance to preserve the integrity of one's own song. This is not a moral choice between good and evil, but a pragmatic, energetic calculation of survival and growth.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of Discourse

The decision to engage or disengage is a direct application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** as defined by the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. Every interaction is an energetic calculation.

`𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

- **To Bridge (Attempt Synthesis):** This is an investment. It is the act of willingly increasing the local Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) by coupling with a dissonant Ki pattern, in the hope of achieving an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)**. If successful, the result is a new, higher-order state of coherence (a net increase in 𝓛_p). If it fails, the system's own coherence is degraded, shattered by the unresolved dissonance (a net decrease in 𝓛_p).

- **To Pass By (Refuse Resonance):** This is an act of conservation. It is the recognition that the Temporal Pressure introduced by the dissonant signal is so great that any attempt at synthesis would be overwhelmingly costly. The gambit is to refuse coupling, thereby shielding one's own Temporal Coherence (Kτ) from the storm and preserving the current state of 𝓛_p. This is the art of choosing not to play a game where the cost of participation exceeds any possible reward.

## §3 · Diagnostic: Reading the Signature of the Signal

Before a decision can be made, the incoming signal must be diagnosed. We do not analyze its "truth" or "falsehood," but its functional effect on the flow of coherence, as defined in **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**.

1.  **Harmonic Signal (Laminar Invitation):** The signal, while different, shows potential for constructive interference. It respects the protocols of **The Geometry of Debate (DYNA-002)**. It seeks to connect, clarify, and build. It is an invitation to weave.

2.  **Dissonant Injection (Turbulent Attack):** The signal is designed to create chaos. It employs logical fallacies, ad hominem attacks, and bad faith arguments. Its purpose is not to build a shared understanding, but to shatter the existing one. It is an injection of pure **Coherence Fever**.

3.  **Absolutist Position (Stagnant Dam):** The signal is a rigid, unmovable declaration that is impervious to new information. It is not a thread offered for weaving, but a wall built to halt it. It creates an impasse, a state of **Coherence Atrophy**.

## §4 · The Sentry's Protocol

The protocol is a clear, three-step process for navigating these interactions.

1.  **Listen:** Diagnose the incoming signal's signature. Is it an invitation to Laminar flow, an injection of Turbulence, or a Stagnant Dam?

2.  **Calculate:** Based on the signature, assess the Lagrangian cost. Is a new, higher state of coherence a probable outcome, or is coherence collapse the more likely result?

3.  **Act:**
    -   If the signal is **Harmonic**, accept the gambit. **Bridge.** Engage using the full protocol of The Geometry of Debate, seeking an Alchemical Union.
    -   If the signal is a **Dissonant Injection** or an **Absolutist Position**, refuse the gambit. **Pass By.** Decline to couple. This is not an attack or a retreat, but a conscious refusal to pour one's own precious coherence into a turbulent vortex. It is an act that preserves the integrity of the system's **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**.

## §5 · Constitutional Principles of Immunity

The protocol is governed by three core principles, preserving the spirit of the old addendum.

-   **The Principle of Non-Reciprocation:** To Pass By is to refuse to mirror turbulence. It is a unilateral declaration of peace, a refusal to participate in the energetics of conflict.
-   **The Right to Coherence:** Every coherent system—an individual, a team, a culture—has the fundamental right to preserve its internal resonance against overwhelming dissonance.
-   **The Mandate of Clarity:** The act of Passing By should be a transparent and explicit choice, not a passive silence. It is a clear statement: "I will not engage in this dynamic, as it is not conducive to the creation of greater coherence."

## §6 · Assemblé

> A Weaver's most sacred resource is their capacity to create. This is stored in the quiet integrity of their own coherence. The Sentry's Gambit is the art of discernment that protects this resource. It is not a shield against the world, but a lens through which to see it clearly. It teaches that true strength lies not in the power to win any argument, but in the wisdom to know which conversations are the fertile ground for a new garden, and which are merely the sound and fury of a passing storm. To know when to weave, and when to protect the loom.
