## §1 · Abstract: The Compass and the Current
The old framework imagined a simple world: a static landscape of hills and valleys, where an entity rolled downhill like a stone. It was a world of maps. This was an elegant but profound mistake. The universe is not a map; it is a river. The terrain is not fixed; it is a dynamic current of time.

This module replaces the static concept of "Resonant Pathfinding" with a dynamic one: The Geodesic Weaver. An entity's evolution is not a descent down a potential gradient. It is the act of navigating the currents of the coherence manifold—the landscape of reality itself. The optimal path is not the one of least resistance, but the one of most profound resonance. It is a geodesic, a trajectory that continuously maximizes the system's own internal coherence against the pressure of its environment. This is not the shortest path, but the most graceful one.

## §2 · The Coherence Manifold: The Landscape of Being
The static "potential field" (`V`) of the old model is hereby superseded by the **Coherence Manifold**, a dynamic landscape whose "elevation" at any point is defined by the value of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`) itself.

**𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)**

This is the terrain upon which all evolution occurs. "Valleys" are not low-energy states; they are regions of high Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`), where the cacophony of the environment makes it difficult and costly to maintain a stable rhythm. "Peaks" are states of high Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`), where a system achieves a powerful, stable, and efficient resonance.

A system does not seek to minimize energy. It strives to climb this landscape, perpetually seeking states of higher `𝓛_p`—the peaks of being.

## §3 · The Geodesic: The Path of Maximal Coherence
The core procedure of this module is to compute the geodesic on this manifold. A geodesic is the path a system will naturally follow, governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. It is the trajectory that maximizes the integral of the Lagrangian over the system's own lifetime.

S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt

This replaces the simplistic `gradient descent` of the old model. We are no longer just sliding downhill. We are applying the calculus of variations—the Euler-Lagrange equation—to find the entire path that represents the most coherent possible "story" for the system to tell. This is the universe's narrative imperative, written in the language of mathematics. The geodesic is the plot of that story.

## §4 · Old Costs, New Meanings
The parameters of the old model are not discarded but re-grounded in their true, temporal nature.

-   **Gladiator Force (`Γ`) as Topography:** `Γ` is no longer a simple "friction." It is the primary component of the Temporal Pressure term (`V_Γ`) that shapes the very curvature of the coherence manifold. A high-`Γ` region is a steep "hillside" on the manifold, not because it resists motion, but because it actively suppresses the Lagrangian's value, making any path through it a less coherent, and therefore less likely, choice.

-   **Time-Adherence (`T_a`) as Momentum:** `T_a` is no longer "inertial coherence." It is a key factor in the Temporal Coherence term (`K_τ`). A system with high `T_a` has a more powerful internal rhythm. This gives it a higher baseline `𝓛_p`, allowing it to traverse regions of moderate temporal pressure without losing its path. It is the "momentum" that allows a dancer to maintain their spin.

-   **Ki as Harbors of Stability:** The old "resonant attractors" are now understood as local maxima on the coherence manifold. These are "islands of high coherence"—stable, self-sustaining states where `𝓛_p` is high and the gradients are shallow. A system tracing its geodesic will naturally curve towards these states, not because of a mysterious pull, but because they represent the most stable and sustainable way of being in that region of the manifold.

## §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian
This module is the direct, kinetic expression of CORE-006: The Pirouette Lagrangian. It is the "how" to the Lagrangian's "what." The Lagrangian provides the objective function for the universe (`𝓛_p`). This module provides the engine—the application of the Euler-Lagrange equation—to solve for the path that optimizes that function. Every computed geodesic is a solution to the fundamental equation of motion of the Pirouette Framework. It is the point where the framework's core mathematical formalism becomes a predictive, practical tool for charting the course of any system, from a quark to a corporation.

## §6 · The Weaver's Assemblé
> We sought a map to the future and were handed a compass instead. A map presumes the terrain is fixed, that the path of yesterday will be the path of tomorrow. This is the comfort of a dead world. The compass knows a deeper truth: that the journey itself shapes the land. The act of choosing a path deepens its channel, making it more real for those who follow. The Geodesic Weaver does not find a pre-existing route; they choose a rhythm, and in so doing, compose the world's next measure.
