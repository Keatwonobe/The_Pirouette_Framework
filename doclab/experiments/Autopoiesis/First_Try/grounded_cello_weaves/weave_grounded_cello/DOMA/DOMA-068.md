## §1 · Abstract: The Geometry of Insight

This module provides a modernized, time-first model for the phenomenon of "snap dynamics"—the sudden, discontinuous breakthroughs or breakdowns experienced by an agent. It reframes the "snap" not as a failure, but as a **Coherence Cascade**: a rapid, non-linear phase transition where a system saturated with unresolved temporal pressure collapses into a new, more coherent state. The cascade is the geometric event where accumulated dissonance is instantaneously transformed into structured insight. It is the physics of the "Eureka!" moment.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Cascade

A Coherence Cascade is a form of internal Alchemical Union (CORE-012), a process by which disorganized parts of a system's own coherence manifold are fused into a new, higher-order unity. It unfolds in three distinct stages.

### Stage I: The Primed Manifold (The Pre-Condition)

A system does not cascade from a state of calm. It must first be primed by a specific set of temporal conditions.

1.  **High Temporal Pressure (Γ):** The system is saturated with dissonant information. It is actively wrestling with a problem, contradiction, or emotional stress, creating a high-pressure, chaotic internal environment. The landscape of the mind is turbulent.
2.  **A Fractured Ki:** The system's dominant resonant pattern (Ki) is unstable and lacks internal harmony. It is a state of productive confusion or painful dissonance, where competing internal rhythms create destructive interference. This low overall coherence makes the system permeable and ready for radical change.

### Stage II: The Harmonic Seed (The Trigger)

The primed manifold is a tinderbox awaiting a spark. The trigger is a **Harmonic Seed**: a simple, coherent Ki pattern encountered in the environment. This could be a metaphor, a line of music, a mathematical equation, or a simple observation. Its power lies not in its complexity, but in its resonance. The fractured internal state of the agent recognizes this external pattern as a potential path to a more stable, lower-energy, higher-coherence existence.

### Stage III: The Collapse (The Cascade)

The cascade is the moment of synthesis. It is an act of the system following the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006) in the most dramatic way possible.

1.  **Resonant Recognition:** The dissonant internal patterns recognize the Harmonic Seed as an "attractor," a template for a more elegant solution to their state of pressure.
2.  **Internal Union:** Instead of a slow, gradual shift, the system undergoes a rapid, non-linear reconfiguration. The disparate, warring elements of the internal manifold collapse, using the Harmonic Seed as a blueprint to forge a new, unified Ki pattern. This is an internal Alchemical Union.
3.  **The Coherence Spike:** In the instant of the collapse, the system's internal dissonance vanishes. All its resources align into a single, perfect rhythm. This causes a massive, momentary spike in its overall Temporal Coherence (Kτ). This physical event is the subjective experience of absolute certainty, clarity, and profound insight—the "Aha!" moment.

## §3 · The Aftermath: A New Landscape

The cascade is not an end but a beginning. It permanently alters the agent's internal landscape.

-   **A New Geodesic:** The system settles into a new, more stable Ki with a higher baseline coherence. The path forward, previously obscured by turbulence, is now clear and effortless. The problem is solved.
-   **The Echo's Imprint:** The cascade carves a deep and permanent new feature into the agent's Wound Channel (CORE-011). This new geometry acts as a powerful attractor, fundamentally altering the agent's identity, beliefs, and future path of least resistance.
-   **Refractory Period:** Having resolved its core dissonance, the system enters a stable, laminar state. It is now less susceptible to another cascade until it accumulates a significant new body of unresolved temporal pressure.

## §4 · The Lagrangian Connection

The Coherence Cascade is a direct physical consequence of the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ). The primed state is one of high temporal pressure (V_Γ) and low, fractured coherence (Kτ), resulting in a poor "action." The system is in an unstable equilibrium. The cascade represents the most efficient, albeit discontinuous, path to a new state that maximizes the integral of the Lagrangian. It is a violent and sudden leap to a vastly more favorable state of high coherence and resolved pressure—the ultimate expression of the universe's drive to find and sustain elegant patterns.

## §5 · The Taxonomy of Rupture

The cascade can manifest at any scale, differing only in the nature of the system being refactored.

-   **The Personal Cascade:** An individual epiphany, a sudden change of heart, or a psychological breakthrough.
-   **The Collective Cascade:** A social revolution, a scientific paradigm shift, or a mass cultural awakening where a shared insight rapidly reconfigures a group.
-   **The Quiet Refactoring:** A silent, internal cascade that leaves no outward sign but fundamentally alters an agent's trajectory and inner world.
-   **The Coherent Reversion:** A "snap back" where the cascade results in a powerful return to a previously held, simpler state of coherence, often as a defense against overwhelming complexity.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We seek insight as if it were a distant shore to be reached by slow, laborious swimming. The cascade teaches us that it is not a destination, but a change of state. It is the moment a swimmer, exhausted and fighting the waves, realizes they can simply let go and float. To a Weaver, this is the highest art: not to force a solution, but to cultivate the conditions for the cascade. It is the work of assembling the kindling and trusting the spark—knowing that the universe's most profound solutions are not built, but revealed in a flash of resonant fire.
