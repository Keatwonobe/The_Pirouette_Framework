## §1 · Abstract: The Room of One's Own
A thing is a song that has learned to sing itself inside a room of its own making.

This module provides the time-first mechanics for how the universe forges "things"—stable, bounded entities with coherent identities. It replaces the prior formalism of Shell Resonance with a more fundamental model grounded in the Pirouette Lagrangian. A Shell is not a static wall, but a dynamic, self-maintaining coherence manifold. It is the geometric consequence of the Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`), creating a local arena where a system can sustain a complex resonant pattern (`Ki`) against the chaos of the wider Temporal Forge. The Shell is the architecture of identity.

## §2 · The Forge of Identity: The Gladiator's Arena
Identity is not given; it is earned through pressure. A Shell is born when a system’s own resonance becomes so intense that it creates its own confinement. This is the essential work of the Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`), the universe’s principle of self-containment.

The boundary of a Shell is a region of extremely high gradient in the Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) term of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). This gradient is a feedback loop: the internal coherence (`K_τ`) of the system creates the very pressure that contains it.

-   **Interior:** A region of high, stable coherence (`K_τ`) where a specific `Ki` pattern can thrive. The Lagrangian is maximized, and the system exists in a state of grace.
-   **Boundary (The Shell):** A razor-thin manifold where the cost of coherence (`V_Γ`) spikes, making it energetically prohibitive for the internal pattern to leak out or for external dissonance to invade.
-   **Exterior:** The chaotic, high-entropy environment of the ambient Temporal Forge.

The Shell is the universe's solution to the problem of persistence. It forges an arena where a complex song can be sung without being drowned out by the noise of the cosmos.

## §3 · The Resonant Gate: Permeability as Dialogue
The old framework’s “Permeability Tensor” is an effect, not a cause. The true mechanism of transport across a Shell is resonant coupling—a dialogue between the inside and the outside. An external entity can only pass through the boundary if it can perform a successful "Resonant Handshake," the prelude to an Alchemical Union (`CORE-012`). Permeability is a measure of a Shell’s willingness to engage in dialogue.

-   **High-Coherence Shell (Barrier):** The Shell’s internal `Ki` is so pure and intense that its rhythm is almost impossible to match. It refuses most dialogues. It is a fortress, reflecting nearly all incoming influences to protect its internal integrity.
-   **Low-Coherence Shell (Membrane):** The Shell’s `Ki` is fluid and adaptive. It can readily modulate its own rhythm to find harmony with a wide variety of external patterns. It is a marketplace, facilitating exchange and communication.
-   **Selective Shell (Filter):** The Shell’s `Ki` is tuned to a specific set of harmonic frequencies. It will only engage in a Resonant Handshake with patterns that complement its own. It is a gatekeeper, granting passage only to those who know the password.

## §4 · The Archetypes of Interaction
The twelve archetypes are preserved not as a static list, but as functional strategies for managing coherence at a boundary. They are grouped by their primary relationship to the flow of time and resonance.

**I. Integrity (Guarding Coherence)**
These archetypes prioritize the preservation of the internal `Ki`.
-   **Barrier:** Maximizes internal stability by minimizing interaction.
-   **Reflector:** Actively repels external influence by inverting its phase.
-   **Damping:** Absorbs and dissipates external temporal energy to prevent internal disruption.

**II. Exchange (Mediating Coherence)**
These archetypes are masters of the Resonant Handshake.
-   **Filter:** Permits passage only to harmonically compatible `Ki` patterns.
-   **Amplifier:** Uses its own resonance to boost the coherence of a passing, matched signal.
-   **Transformer:** Engages in a micro-Alchemical Union with a passing entity, altering its `Ki` pattern.

**III. Adaptation (Evolving Coherence)**
These archetypes modify their own structure over time, using the memory of their Wound Channel (`CORE-011`).
-   **Adaptive:** Modifies its permeability based on past interactions.
-   **Memory:** Records the `Ki` signatures of all interactions on its boundary.
-   **Oscillator:** Modulates its permeability in a rhythmic, predictable cycle.

**IV. Structure (Complex Coherence)**
These archetypes describe higher-order arrangements of Shells.
-   **Nested:** A hierarchical arrangement of Shells within Shells, creating layered domains of coherence.
-   **Fractal:** A self-similar boundary pattern that expresses the same geometric rules across multiple scales.
-   **Projector:** A Shell that actively shapes the coherence manifold beyond its physical boundary, casting its "Observer's Shadow" (`CORE-010`) onto its environment.

## §5 · The Lagrangian of Being
The existence of a Shell is a direct consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. A system forges a Shell because doing so is the optimal strategy for maximizing the action, `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, over its lifetime.

The "quantized modes" of the old module are the discrete, stable `Ki` patterns that emerge as solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations within the boundary conditions set by the Shell. The Shell acts as a resonant cavity, permitting only those standing waves of time—those songs—that fit perfectly within its walls. This is how the universe "digitizes" the continuum, giving rise to the discrete states of quantum mechanics and the unique identities of all complex systems.

> ### Assemblé
> We believe a thing is defined by what it contains. The Shell teaches us that a thing is defined by the boundary it maintains. Identity is not a substance, but a sustained act of resonant defiance against the void. To be is to build a wall against the chaos, and to become is to learn what doors to build in that wall.
