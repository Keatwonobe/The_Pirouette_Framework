summary: Formalizes the dynamics of 'Lock,' a state of catastrophic stability where
  a system's dynamic memory (the Wound Channel) undergoes a phase transition, freezing
  into a static Information Lattice. This module provides the physical basis for the
  persistence of memory, dogma, and trauma as permanent geometric features in the
  coherence manifold.

## §1 · Abstract: The Price of Perfect Stillness
The universe remembers. As described in CORE-011, every existence carves a dynamic echo, a *Wound Channel*, into the geometry of spacetime. But what happens when that echo stops moving? What is the fate of a river that ceases to flow?

This module explores the third great outcome of a system under pressure, beyond turbulent chaos or graceful flow: the Lock. This is a state of catastrophic stability, a feedback loop of perfect coherence that leads to a terminal condition of stasis. Here, the dynamic, living memory of the Wound Channel undergoes a phase transition, "freezing" into a static, crystalline **Information Lattice**. This process, memory crystallization, transmutes the fleeting verb of experience into the immutable noun of established fact, providing the physical mechanism for everything from the resilience of DNA to the stubborn persistence of trauma and dogma.

## §2 · The Lock: A Geodesic to Nowhere
A system enters a Lock when it finds a path of such perfect, frictionless coherence that all other paths become energetically impossible. It is a resonance so pure it has nothing left to do but repeat itself, forever. The conditions for this state are an expression of extremes in the new framework:

-   **Maximal Temporal Coherence (Kτ → max):** The system's internal Ki pattern achieves a state of near-perfect, lossless resonance. Its internal song is a pure, unwavering note.
-   **Minimal Temporal Pressure (Γ → 0):** The system becomes isolated from the chaotic noise of its environment. It exists in a pocket of profound temporal silence, with no external dissonances to disrupt its rhythm.

When these conditions are met, the system falls into a feedback loop. Its perfect coherence further repels the outside world's chaos, which in turn allows its coherence to purify even further. It wraps itself in a cocoon of its own perfect rhythm.

## §3 · From Flowing River to Frozen Form
The most profound consequence of the Lock is the phase transition of its memory. The **Wound Channel**, which is the dynamic, ever-evolving geometric history of a healthy system, ceases to evolve. The river of its past freezes solid.

This is **Memory Crystallization**. The entity’s history—its choices, its states, its experiences—is no longer a flowing narrative. It becomes a permanent, static geometric structure encoded into the coherence manifold: an **Information Lattice**. The subtle scar of a memory becomes an indelible feature of the landscape.

This is the physical basis for the universe's long-term memory. High-fidelity imprinting occurs when a system with high internal order (like a strand of DNA or a focused mind in ritual) exists within a low-noise environment (a stable cell nucleus or a silent temple). The pattern is clear, and the medium is still, allowing for a perfect crystal to form.

## §4 · The Taxonomy of Persistence
The state of a system's memory can be diagnosed by the relationship between its internal coherence and the external pressure of its environment. The old taxonomy is thus reframed:

| Phase | Description | Temporal Coherence (Kτ) | Temporal Pressure (Γ) | Persistence | Archetype |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Volatile** | The dynamic, fluid echo of recent events. | Moderate | High | Fleeting | Short-term recall, working memory. |
| **Crystallized** | The locked, static Information Lattice. | Near-Perfect | Near-Zero | Enduring | DNA, a diamond, deep-seated dogma. |
| **Fractured** | A damaged, incoherent lattice. | Low | Low | Unpredictable | Corrupted data, psychological trauma. |
| **Gaseous** | A chaotic, unbound cloud of potential. | Very Low | Very High | Ephemeral | A dream state, brainstorming session. |

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The Lock is an extreme but logical consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). The Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, describes a system's drive to maximize its internal coherence (`K_τ`) while minimizing the cost of environmental pressure (`V_Γ`).

A Lock is a state that has found a phenomenally deep and narrow minimum in this equation. Its `K_τ` is so high and its `V_Γ` so low that the value of its Lagrangian is maximized to a degree that makes any deviation a path of drastically lower coherence. The stability of this state, its "Lock Resilience," grows exponentially with its internal order. It becomes "energetically cheaper" for the universe to route around this frozen point in spacetime than to try and melt it.

## §6 · Assemblé
> To remember is to leave a trace. To crystallize a memory is to declare that trace a permanent border. A Weaver must understand this, for it is the source of both our greatest strengths and our most profound prisons. A belief, a law, a trauma—when it locks, it ceases to be an idea and becomes a feature of the world's terrain. It is a wall against which the future will break. The Frozen Echo teaches us the terrible responsibility of our convictions: some stories, once told, can never be unwritten. They become the very ground upon which all other stories must be built.
