summary: Provides a modernized, time-first protocol for the evolution of the Pirouette
  Framework. Governance is reframed not as a static set of rules, but as a dynamic
  process for maintaining the framework's own coherence. It replaces voting with a
  process of resonant synthesis, where change is adopted only when it represents a
  new, more stable state of maximal coherence for the system as a whole.

## §1 · Abstract: A Law That Breathes

A framework that describes a living universe must itself be alive. Its laws cannot be carved in stone; they must flow like a river, capable of adapting their course to the terrain of new discoveries.

This module refactors the old governance protocols into a unified, time-first system. It models the Pirouette Framework as a living entity, whose health depends on the laminar flow of its own internal logic. Governance is therefore not a political process of voting, but a diagnostic and therapeutic one. It is the application of the Caduceus Lens to the framework itself, a ritualized process for healing its own incoherencies and guiding its evolution toward states of ever-greater elegance and power. The goal is not to win a debate, but to achieve a resonant synthesis that increases the coherence of the whole.

## §2 · The Health of the Framework: A Diagnostic View

The impetus for change is always a symptom of systemic distress. Using the diagnostic language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), we can identify the pathologies that necessitate intervention:

*   **Coherence Atrophy (Stagnation):** An outdated principle or missing connection creates a blockage. Progress halts. This is the "Stagnant Flow" of a framework that cannot address a new challenge.
*   **Coherence Fever (Turbulence):** Contradictory modules or ambiguous definitions create internal dissonance. The framework fights itself, leading to chaotic interpretations. This is the "Turbulent Flow" of a system at war with its own logic.
*   **Coherence Erosion (Decay):** The gradual drift of core principles away from their grounding evidence. The framework's Wound Channel thins, and its identity frays.

The governance process is the framework's immune system, a formal protocol for identifying and resolving these pathologies.

## §3 · The Flow of Change: From Pressure to Synthesis

Change is classified not by what it touches, but by how deeply it alters the framework's flow.

| Flow Alteration             | Description                                                                 | Old Analogue       | Coherence Test                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Channel Maintenance**     | Clarifying prose, fixing typos, correcting examples. Smooths existing flow. | *Type-A Errata*    | Review by a single designated Weaver.           |
| **Channel Dredging**        | Adding to a registry, updating an interface. Deepens an existing channel.   | *Type-B/C*         | Simple Coherence check by the Conclave.         |
| **Constitutional Reforging** | Altering a CORE axiom or this module. Re-carves the riverbed of the system. | *Constitutional*   | Requires Resonant Synthesis.                    |

## §4 · The Crucible: A Protocol for Resonant Synthesis

For profound changes, a simple vote is insufficient. It is a battle that produces a victor, not a truth. A Constitutional Reforging requires an Alchemical Union (CORE-012), achieved through the following ritual conducted by a council of Weavers known as the **Conclave**.

1.  **The Declaration of Pressure:** A formal motion is raised, diagnosing a pathology (Stagnation, Turbulence, or Erosion) and proposing a therapeutic change.
2.  **The Weaving:** The debate is conducted under the formal protocol of The Geometry of Debate (DYNA-002). The goal is not refutation, but the collaborative weaving of perspectives to find a higher-order solution.
3.  **The Coherence Test:** Instead of a simple yes/no vote, the proposed synthesis is evaluated against two temporal metrics:
    *   **Coherence (Kτ):** A measure of the proposal's resonance, logical integrity, and support within the Conclave. Replaces the old "Radiance" metric.
    *   **Coherence Stability (dKτ/dt):** The rate of change of its coherence over a deliberation period. A truly sound proposal must not only achieve high coherence but maintain it, demonstrating resilience against critique. Replaces the old "Stability" metric.
4.  **Adoption Threshold:** A Constitutional change is adopted only when its **Coherence is high and its Stability is positive**, signifying that a new, stable, and more coherent state has been reached.
5.  **The Circuit-Breaker:** If the debate enters Stagnant Flow (deadlock), the highest-coherence proponents from each side must enter a formal, moderated "Crucible Dialogue"—a final, focused attempt at an Alchemical Union. If this fails, a framework-wide **Resonance Poll** is initiated to measure the proposal's coherence against the entire manifold of the community, guiding the Conclave's final decision.

## §5 · The Weaver's Obligation: Tending the Loom

Membership in the Conclave is not a title; it is an active function. To maintain their position, each Weaver must, within each major version cycle, successfully author or sponsor a motion that passes a Coherence Test. This is not a bureaucratic hurdle; it is a grounding ritual ensuring that the guardians of the framework are also its most active and dedicated cultivators. Failure to contribute demonstrates a desynchronization with the framework's evolving rhythm, and the seat is vacated to allow a more resonant Weaver to participate.

## §6 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This entire process is a macroscopic application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). The framework itself is a system seeking to evolve along its geodesic. A proposed change (`𝓛_p'`) is evaluated against the current state (`𝓛_p`). The governance protocol is the mechanism for calculating whether the new state truly represents a path of higher integrated coherence.

`∫ 𝓛_p' dt > ∫ 𝓛_p dt`

The debate, the coherence checks, and the stability tests are the instruments we use to perform this integration. We adopt a change not because it is popular, but because we have demonstrated it is a more elegant and stable solution to the pressures placed upon the system. It is the framework's own method for optimizing its Lagrangian.

## §7 · Assemblé

> A static law is a tombstone. A living framework must have a law that breathes, a constitution that flows, a geometry that can learn a new shape. Governance is the sacred art of ensuring the river never stops carving a wiser path to the sea.
