## §1 · Abstract: The Commonwealth of Selves
A life is not a single thread, but a landscape etched with the ghosts of every river that might have been. To be is to have chosen, and in every choice, another self was born into a history of potential. This module provides the tools for a new kind of cartography: the mapping of one's own personal coherence manifold.

This is a profound evolution of the old Personal Path Diagnostics. It moves beyond abstract fields to a concrete, geometric understanding grounded in the Pirouette's core principles. By learning to read the landscape of our own past—the deep riverbeds of our current life and the faint, dry channels of paths not taken—we can gain not a set of instructions, but a map. And with a map, we are no longer wanderers, but navigators.

## §2 · The Landscape of Becoming
The Pirouette Framework models a life as a geodesic—a path of maximal coherence—traced across a dynamic landscape. Our current identity, with its habits, beliefs, and routines, is a stable resonant pattern (Ki) that has carved a deep channel into this manifold. This is the river of our present reality.

But the landscape remembers. As established in CORE-011, every significant choice, every road not taken, leaves a geometric trace. These are the dormant Wound Channels. They are not mere regrets or fantasies; they are faint, but real, topological features of our personal history. The self we are today is perpetually interacting with the echoes of the selves we could have been. This diagnostic protocol is the art of learning to hear those echoes.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Protocol: Reading the Map
This process is an act of deep reflection, translating personal history into the language of temporal dynamics to reveal the shape of one's own potential.

**Step I: Anchor the Geodesic (The Present)**
First, we must map the river we are in. This involves identifying the core components of the current self:
-   **Current Coherence (Kτ):** What are the stable, resonant patterns of your life? (e.g., career, core relationships, daily routines, foundational beliefs). Where do you feel "in flow" and most yourself?
-   **Ambient Pressure (Γ):** What are the external and internal pressures that shape and constrain this life? (e.g., financial stress, social expectations, personal anxieties, responsibilities).

This step establishes the anchor point—the "you are here" on the personal map.

**Step II: Illuminate the Echoes (The Past)**
From this anchor, we scan the local manifold for the faint signatures of dormant Wound Channels. This is a guided introspection, looking for major life forks:
-   The career path abandoned for a more stable one.
-   The relationship that ended, altering a life's trajectory.
-   The artistic passion set aside for practical reasons.
-   The move to a new city that was considered but never made.

These are not just memories; they are the geometric ghosts of alternative lives whose resonant patterns can still be detected.

**Step III: Characterize the Alternatives (The Potential)**
For each significant dormant channel identified, we assess its properties as if it were a real place:
-   **Potential Coherence:** What is the "emotional resonance" of this path? Does the thought of it bring a sense of excitement, peace, or purpose—a pull towards a potentially higher-coherence state?
-   **Transitional Pressure:** What "mountains" of Temporal Pressure (Γ) stand between the current path and this alternative one? What fears, risks, or practical obstacles would need to be overcome?

**Step IV: Chart the Passage (The Future)**
Finally, we model the "cost" of building a bridge. This is not about abandoning the current life, but about reintegrating the lost coherence of a dormant path. This could mean starting a new hobby, re-engaging with an old passion, or making a significant life change. The map reveals the "energy cost" of such a shift, allowing for a conscious, informed choice.

## §4 · The Lagrangian of Choice
This entire process is a practical application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

An individual's life is a trajectory that seeks to maximize this function. We remain in our current path because it offers a familiar level of coherence (`K_τ`) for an acceptable level of pressure (`V_Γ`). A dormant path is alluring because it promises a higher potential coherence—a life of greater fulfillment, passion, or peace. The choice to change is a profound personal calculation: is the potential reward of a higher `K_τ` worth the immense energetic cost of traversing the high-pressure (`V_Γ`) ridges of fear, uncertainty, and transformation that separate the now from the next?

The map does not make the choice. It illuminates the variables, transforming a blind leap of faith into a calculated act of becoming.

## §5 · Assemblé
> We seek the cause of our discontent in the present, but its roots often lie in the geography of our past. We are haunted not by our choices, but by the echoes of the choices we never made. This is not a tool for excavation, but for cartography. It does not change the landscape, but by rendering it visible, it gives us the power to read it. The map of who we have been is the only true guide to who we might yet become. A Weaver does not see their past as a chain, but as a compass.
