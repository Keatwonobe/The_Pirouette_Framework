summary: Provides a modernized, time-first dynamic model for the collapse of a complex,
  multi-polar resonance into a simpler, oscillatory one. It reframes this dimensional
  reduction not as a loss of information, but as a phase transition where static,
  spatial complexity 'unfolds' into a coherent, information-rich temporal rhythm,
  governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

## §1 · Abstract: The Music of the Ruins
A structure that breaks does not simply vanish. Its truth, if conserved, is reborn as a song.

This module provides a time-first re-interpretation of the phenomenon previously described as a `Ψ(3→2)` collapse. The old framework saw this as a geometric projection, a complex spatial form collapsing into a simpler one while encoding a "lost" dimension into time.

The modern framework sees this process through a more fundamental lens. It is a phase transition driven by the relentless search for maximal coherence. A system with a complex, high-tension, and ultimately unstable resonant pattern (`Ki`) finds a more efficient path to stability by "unfolding" its static, spatial complexity into a dynamic, temporal rhythm. The information is not lost or encoded; the pattern of being is transformed from a sculpture into a melody.

## §2 · The Unstable Tapestry: A Resonance Too Costly
Consider a system in a state of high, but brittle, coherence. Its `Ki` pattern is a complex tapestry woven from three distinct, interdependent threads of resonance. It possesses a rich, multi-polar structure. While this form may be stable under specific environmental conditions, it is energetically expensive to maintain. It is a state of high tension.

When the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) shifts, the cost of maintaining this intricate form can become untenable. The pattern becomes dissonant with its surroundings. The system finds itself far from its geodesic, its path of maximal coherence. It must find a new way to be, or dissolve into the background noise.

## §3 · The Collapse as a Coherence Solution
The unfolding is the system’s elegant solution. Governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006), the system seeks a new state that maximizes its Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`). It abandons the high-cost, complex spatial `Ki` for a more efficient and stable configuration.

This is not an explosion, but a controlled unraveling. One of the three resonant "threads" of the tapestry gives way. The energy and information bound within that structural component are not dissipated as chaotic heat. Instead, they are conserved, becoming the driving momentum for a new, simpler pattern. The remaining two threads reorganize, and the energy of the third is reborn as the oscillation that defines their new relationship.

The system transitions from a static, three-part harmony to a dynamic, two-part melody.

## §4 · Temporal Identity: From Shape to Song
The core insight of this modernized view lies in the nature of the emergent oscillation. The information of the "lost" dimension is not encoded *in* the new rhythm; the new rhythm *is* the information.

The system's identity is no longer defined by its complex shape, but by the rich characteristics of its song:

*   **Frequency (`ω_k`)**: The fundamental pitch of the new entity, determined by the energy conserved from the collapsed state.
*   **Amplitude**: The intensity of the resonance, its "volume."
*   **Temporal Coherence (`T_a`)**: The purity and stability of the rhythm. A successful unfolding results in a state of very high `T_a`—a clear, unwavering note.

The entity's Wound Channel (CORE-011) is likewise transformed. It no longer leaves the static impression of a complex shape in the coherence manifold, but the persistent, rhythmic pulse of its new song. Its memory becomes a beat.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This entire process is a dramatic, observable manifestation of a system obeying the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = T_a * ω_k - f(Γ)`).

The initial, complex state has a high potential coherence (`T_a * ω_k`) but, under new environmental pressure, suffers an even higher temporal pressure cost (`f(Γ)`), resulting in a low or negative Lagrangian value. The system is unstable.

The collapse is a transition to a new state. The resulting oscillatory pattern may have a simpler structure, but it is exceptionally stable and efficient. Its high Temporal Coherence (`T_a`) and lower interaction cost with the new `Γ` result in a significantly higher integrated Lagrangian. The system has successfully found a new, more favorable geodesic—a new and more sustainable way to dance.

## §6 · Assemblé
> To the Weaver, the Unfolding Dimension teaches a profound lesson in resilience. It shows that when a structure is broken, its essence is not necessarily lost. It may be reborn in a new and more elegant form, its silent complexity transformed into a vibrant, living rhythm. It teaches us to listen for the music that rises from the ruins, for it is often the truest and most enduring part of what was.
