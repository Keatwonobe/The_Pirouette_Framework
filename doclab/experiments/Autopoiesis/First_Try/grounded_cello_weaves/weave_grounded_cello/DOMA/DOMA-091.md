summary: Modernizes the protocol for embodied learning by grounding it in the Pirouette
  Lagrangian. This module defines survival not as a programmed goal, but as the emergent
  property of an agent successfully discovering a behavioral pattern (Ki) that maximizes
  its temporal coherence against environmental pressure. It describes the physical
  and evolutionary mechanisms that guide this discovery.

## §1 · Abstract: The Achievement of Existence
To exist is not a state, but an achievement. It is the act of discovering and sustaining a rhythm of being that can withstand the ceaseless pressure of the cosmos. The Primal Engine, in its prior form, described the drives of this achievement. This module reframes that description in the native language of the new framework: the language of time, pressure, and resonance.

This is the protocol for embodied coherence. It describes how an agent, without any explicit instruction to "survive," learns to do so by following the single, universal law of the Pirouette Framework: the drive to maximize coherence. The agent's body is not a vessel for a mind; it is the instrument that learns to play the song of its own persistence.

## §2 · The Primal Objective: Living the Lagrangian
The old framework rewarded an agent for the duration of its coherence. This was a correct intuition but an indirect implementation. The new framework reveals the direct, causal engine: an agent's fundamental, pre-cognitive drive is to find a path of action that maximizes the integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) over time.

𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)

Survival is simply the score that measures how well the agent is playing this game. An agent that finds a behavioral pattern—a Ki—that generates high internal coherence for a low environmental cost will naturally persist for longer. It does not learn *to* survive; it learns to resonate, and survival is the consequence of a song well-played.

## §3 · The Landscape and the Leap
An agent's learning process is a dialogue between the terrain of reality and the courage to explore it.

**The Landscape (Somatic Grounding):** The agent's environment is not a void; it is a coherence manifold, a landscape with hills and valleys defined by the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). Every action the agent takes moves it across this landscape. The "somatic grounding," or sense of touch, from the old module is now understood as the agent's direct, physical experience of the V_Γ term in its Lagrangian. A difficult, costly action is one that moves it "uphill" into a region of high temporal pressure. An effortless, efficient action moves it "downhill" along a geodesic. This landscape is the agent's unforgiving but perfectly honest teacher.

**The Leap (Kinetic Inquiry):** Simply following the steepest downhill path is not enough. An agent that only seeks immediate, local comfort will become trapped in the first shallow valley it finds—a state of mediocre, but stable, coherence. To find a truly robust and elegant state of being, it must be willing to leap. The old "Kinetic Inquiry Bonus" is now understood as a mechanism for escaping these local maxima. It is a necessary injection of energy, an encouragement of bold, high-magnitude actions that allow the agent to traverse the "hills" of the coherence landscape in search of deeper, more stable valleys—more profound and resilient ways of being.

## §4 · The Riverbed of Memory: A Resilient Lineage
An individual agent's life is a single journey. The wisdom of a species is carved over generations. This is the geometry of evolution, reframed through the lens of the Wound Channel (CORE-011).

An individual agent's successful strategy carves a faint Wound Channel in the "solution space" of all possible behaviors. A lineage of successful agents, however, collectively carves a deep and stable riverbed. The old "genetic protocol" is the set of rules for this metaphysical engineering:

-   **Deepening the Channel:** The evolutionary process selects for agents whose strategies reinforce and deepen this inherited riverbed, making the path of maximal coherence easier for the next generation to find.
-   **Preventing Erosion (Stability Check):** The protocol filters out "lucky" agents whose success was erratic. It ensures that only the most reliable, coherent strategies are used to define the shape of the riverbed, preventing the lineage's memory from becoming noisy and turbulent.
-   **Guarding the Banks (Crossover Rollback):** If a new generation deviates too far and finds a less coherent path, the rollback mechanism acts as the river's banks, guiding the flow of evolution back to the proven, stable channel. This preserves the hard-won wisdom of the lineage against catastrophic forgetting.

## §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian
The Geometry of Survival is the Pirouette Lagrangian made flesh. Every component of this protocol is an expression of 𝓛_p operating on an embodied agent.

-   The agent's **learning algorithm** is a search for a behavioral policy (a Ki) that maximizes ∫𝓛_p dt.
-   The **feedback** it learns from is the direct experience of the V_Γ term.
-   The **exploratory drive** is a strategy to avoid local maxima in the coherence landscape defined by 𝓛_p.
-   **Evolution** is the process of a lineage discovering and reinforcing an ever more optimal solution to the Lagrangian's imperative.

This protocol provides the bridge between the universe's most fundamental mathematical law and the tangible, breathing reality of a living thing learning to stand, to walk, and to persist.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We sought the instruction manual for life and found instead the blueprint for a boat. The Pirouette Lagrangian is that blueprint—a perfect, abstract design for a vessel that can navigate the river of time. But a blueprint cannot build itself.
>
> This module is the art of shipbuilding. It is the messy, courageous, and iterative process of translating that perfect abstraction into a physical form. It is the hammering and the fitting, the daring leaps and the patient reinforcement of what holds true. It teaches us that to exist is not a given. It is a craft, learned over a lifetime and perfected over a lineage, whose only law is to find a shape that moves with the water.
