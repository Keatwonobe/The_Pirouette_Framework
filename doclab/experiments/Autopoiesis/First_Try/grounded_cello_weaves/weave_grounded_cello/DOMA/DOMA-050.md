summary: Re-frames the concept of Radiance from a transactional score to a diagnostic
  measure of an action's impact on a system's health and coherence. It defines a 'Weaving'
  as any intervention that helps a system move towards a state of healthier, more
  laminar flow, as measured by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §1 · Abstract: The End of Accounting

The prior framework sought to build an engine for identifying "Radiance," an attempt to convert the nuanced art of altruism into a transactional, queryable metric. It was an accountant's approach to grace—a ledger for good deeds. While noble in its intent to make constructive influence visible, its mechanics were those of a machine built to quantify, not to understand.

This module replaces the engine with a compass. It reframes the measurement of positive impact not as a score to be tallied, but as a diagnostic act of systemic medicine. A "good" action is not one that generates a high number, but one that can be shown to have healed a fractured system, easing its flow from a state of turbulence or stagnation into one of graceful, laminar coherence. This is the Weaver's Compass, a tool for navigating the moral landscape by the light of resonance itself.

## §2 · From Radiance to Resonance: The Lagrangian of Influence

The core of this new model is grounded directly in the universe's fundamental drive as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). An action's virtue is no longer a matter of opinion or complex coefficients; it is a measurable change in a target system's ability to exist.

We define a **Weaving** as an intervention by an Actor that measurably affects the coherence of a Target system. The influence (`I`) of this Weaving is the change in the Target's "action"—the integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian over one of its own cycles (`τ_p`).

`I = ΔS_p = ∫[0 to τ_p] (𝓛_p(post) - 𝓛_p(pre)) dt`

-   A **Constructive Weaving (`I > 0`)**: The action has increased the Target's overall coherence. It has made it easier for the system to maintain its resonant pattern (`Ki`), either by increasing its internal stability (`K_τ`) or by lessening the external temporal pressure it must fight against (`V_Γ`). This is the formal definition of healing.
-   A **Destructive Weaving (`I < 0`)**: The action has decreased the Target's coherence, increasing its internal dissonance and pushing it towards a state of chaotic, turbulent flow. This is the formal definition of harm.

This single principle replaces the entire complex formula of the old Radiance score. The disparate parts of the old equation—coherence generated, entropy exported, empathy, risk—are all implicitly contained within this one integral of the universe's objective function.

## §3 · The Anatomy of a Weaving

The components of the old `RIE` are not discarded but are re-expressed as facets of this more fundamental, unified process.

-   **Coherence Generated (`ΔC`)** is now understood as `ΔK_τ`, the measurable increase in the Target system's temporal coherence. It is the clarity of its new, healthier song.
-   **Entropy Exported (`ΔS`)** is now `-ΔV_Γ`, the reduction in the internal temporal pressure and chaotic noise the Target system must endure. It is the quieting of its fever.
-   **Empathy (`κ`) & Observer Trust (`η`)** are unified under the principle of **The Observer's Shadow** (`CORE-010`). The measurement of a Weaving is not a passive report, but a resonant coupling between the observer and the event. "Trust" is no longer an arbitrary weight but a measure of the observer's own internal coherence. A skilled, focused, and coherent observer casts a clear Shadow, creating a high-fidelity record of the event. A biased or distracted observer creates a noisy, unreliable measurement.

## §4 · The Compass in Practice: A Diagnostic Protocol

The transactional API of the old module is replaced by a diagnostic ritual grounded in the dynamics of flow and observation.

1.  **Diagnosis (The Caduceus Lens)**: Using the principles of `DYNA-003`, a Weaver first observes a system to identify a state of Turbulent or Stagnant flow. This is the identification of a need for healing.
2.  **Intervention (The Weaving)**: An Actor performs an intervention intended to restore the system to Laminar Flow—to unblock its stagnation or calm its turbulence.
3.  **Attestation (The Echo's Record)**: A third-party observer, acting as the Compass, measures the effect. This is an act of profound focus, where the observer's own coherence manifold attunes to the change in the Target system. The record they create is not a simple data packet but a "resonant testimony," a high-fidelity imprint of the event's echo upon the fabric of spacetime, as described in `CORE-011`.
4.  **Integration (The Ledger of Flow)**: These attested records form a shared map of coherence flows. This is not a ledger of tokens to be owned or traded. It is a living, topographical chart of the community's health, showing where constructive actions have deepened the riverbeds of laminar flow, making it easier for all to follow the path of maximal coherence.

## §5 · The Lagrangian Connection

The Weaver's Compass is inextricably bound to the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). It elevates ethics from a set of prescriptive rules to a descriptive, physical science. The central question of the Compass is: **Did this action make it easier for another system to be itself?**

By measuring the change in the Lagrangian's integral, we are measuring the change in the "cost of existence" for the target system. A constructive act is one that lowers this cost, helping another part of the universe better express its own unique pattern against the background of chaos. This provides a profound, physical, and non-arbitrary foundation for ethical action. It is the physics of compassion.

## §6 · Assemblé

> The old engine sought to turn grace into a currency. It was a well-intentioned error, for the moment something can be counted, it can be hoarded. The Weaver's Compass offers a different path. It does not create a score to be won, but a direction to be followed. It is the tool that transforms the abstract desire to 'do good' into the practical, resonant art of systemic healing. It replaces the accountant's cold ledger with the physician's living chart, guiding the Weaver's hand not toward acts of transactional merit, but toward moments of demonstrable, and therefore beautiful, coherence.
