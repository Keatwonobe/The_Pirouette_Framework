summary: Defines 'Drift' as the slow degradation of a system's coherence, leading

  along a less efficient geodesic.

## §1 · Abstract: The Quiet Decline

A system rarely dies in a single, catastrophic moment. More often, it dies by a thousand small, uncorrected deviations. This module refactors the old concept of 'Drift' into a modern, time-first dynamic.

Drift is the slow, insidious erosion of a system's coherence. It is not a distinct state of being but a chronic, low-grade form of **Turbulent Flow** (DYNA-001). While a healthy system follows its geodesic—its path of maximal coherence—a drifting system begins to meander, wasting energy in subtle friction and accumulating temporal noise. It maintains enough form to avoid collapse, but has lost the crisp alignment of its optimal state. It is the quiet fraying of the thread that binds a system to its purpose.

## §2 · The Anatomy of Erosion

The mechanics of Drift are best understood not as the failure of a single parameter, but as a slow degradation of the entire autopoietic cycle.

-   **From Geodesic to Meander:** In the language of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006), a system's "action" is the integral of its coherence over time. Drift is a state where this integral is consistently and slowly decreasing. The system is becoming less efficient, extracting less order and stability from its environment. It is still following a path of least resistance, but that path now leads down a gentle slope of decay.

-   **The Source of Friction:** This decay is driven by the system's imperfect ability to resist the constant, dissonant pressure of ambient temporal noise, the manifestation of entropy defined in **The River of Information** (CORE-013). Each small, uncorrected error, each moment of slight misalignment, introduces a whisper of turbulence. Over time, these whispers accumulate, creating a persistent drag on the system's health.

## §3 · The Wound Channel as a Rutted Road

The most insidious aspect of Drift lies in its interaction with the system's own memory, its **Wound Channel** (CORE-011).

A healthy system carves a clean, deep channel, reinforcing its optimal pattern of behavior. Drift is the process of carving a new, less efficient channel adjacent to the old one. Each meandering step makes the new path slightly deeper, and the old one slightly harder to return to.

The system's own inertia—its tendency to follow the echo of its own past—begins to work against it. The drifted path becomes a rut. The memory that once ensured stability now ensures the persistence of a suboptimal state. This is why Drift is so difficult to correct; it slowly turns a system's identity into its own cage.

## §4 · Diagnostic Signatures of a Drifting System

Instead of tracking complex, abstract dimensions, a Weaver can diagnose Drift by observing its tangible effects on a system's flow.

-   **Coherence Leakage:** The system requires more energy, more resources, or more time to produce the same output. Its efficiency is declining. This is the primary signature of a decreasing Lagrangian. There is a slow, steady "leak" of coherence.

-   **Low-Grade Turbulence:** The system is not in an overt crisis, but it is characterized by persistent friction. In an organization, this manifests as constant minor rework, bureaucratic drag, and a pervasive feeling of "wading through mud." The flow is neither smooth nor fully chaotic; it is simply inefficient.

-   **Path Fixation:** The system becomes rigid and resistant to change. The energy required to "jump the rut" of its degraded Wound Channel and find a new, more optimal path becomes prohibitively high. Innovation falters, and the system can only repeat its familiar, inefficient patterns. This is the precursor to stagnation and eventual collapse.

## §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian

Drift is the direct, observable consequence of a system whose **Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)** is slowly decaying. The total coherence generated over time, `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, fails to maintain its peak value. The system evolves not toward catastrophic failure, but toward a state of lower, but temporarily stable, coherence. The "forces" guiding it are still active, but they are now leading the system into a basin of attraction characterized by chronic inefficiency. It is the slow cooling of the system's internal forge.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We train our eyes for the storm, the fracture, the sudden collapse. But an old tree does not fall in a single gust of wind; it is hollowed out from the inside, year by quiet year. Drift is the whisper of entropy, the silent work of the woodworm, the quiet fraying of the thread that holds all things together. The Weaver's finest art is not to mend the dramatic break, but to sense the subtle loss of tension and reinforce the weave before it is ever torn.
