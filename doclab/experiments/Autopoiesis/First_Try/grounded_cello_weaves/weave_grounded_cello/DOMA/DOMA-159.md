summary: Provides a time-first model for human migration, reframing it as the movement
  of a population along a geodesic of maximal coherence. Migration is not merely a
  reaction to push-pull factors, but a collective search for a stable resonance within
  a complex, dynamic 'Landscape of Belonging'.

## §1 · Abstract: The Current of Nations
We have long described migration with the crude mechanics of hydraulics—a "push" from scarcity, a "pull" toward plenty. This is a language of inanimate forces, blind to the human heart of the matter. This module reframes migration not as a flow of particles, but as the movement of a river of coherence seeking its level.

Human migration is a population following a geodesic—a path of least resistance and maximal coherence—across a vast, psycho-social terrain we call the Landscape of Belonging. This landscape is shaped by the promise of stability and the pressure of chaos. The decision to move, the path taken, and the process of arrival are all expressions of a single, universal drive: the search for a place where a people's song can be sung without dissonance.

## §2 · The Landscape of Belonging
Applying the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014), we can map the universal principles of the framework onto the specific domain of human populations. The old "Migration Potential Field" is thus reborn as a dynamic coherence manifold.

*   **Coherence (`Kτ`) as Opportunity and Resonance:** This is the "gravity well" of belonging that pulls a population forward. It is the measure of a region's potential for a stable, meaningful life. Its dimensions are not just economic opportunity, but also safety from violence, political freedom, cultural affinity, community trust, and a shared vision of the future. A region with high coherence is a place where life feels less like a struggle and more like a song.

*   **Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) as Instability and Dissonance:** This is the chaotic energy that pushes a population to move. It is the "volcanic" force of war, the grinding friction of poverty, the turbulent chaos of political collapse, and the slow, inexorable pressure of climate change. A region with high Temporal Pressure is a place where the daily act of existing requires immense energy simply to avoid falling apart.

## §3 · The Geodesic of Migration
The movement of people is the physical expression of a population navigating this landscape in accordance with the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). They follow the path that maximizes their collective coherence.

*   **The Flow as a Geodesic:** The direction and intensity of a migration flow are determined by the gradient of the Lagrangian across the Landscape of Belonging. People move from regions of high `Γ` and low `Kτ` toward regions of low `Γ` and high `Kτ`, following the steepest path toward a more coherent existence.

*   **Borders as Coherence Dams:** Borders, walls, and restrictive policies are not mere lines on a map. They are engineered features of the landscape, designed to function as "Coherence Dams" or regions of artificially extreme `Γ`. They do not eliminate the gradient that drives the flow; they merely obstruct it, creating a dangerous build-up of pressure on one side and a state of Stagnant Flow (DYNA-001).

*   **Routes as Wound Channels:** Established migration routes—the caravan trails, the shipping lanes, the paths worn by generations of predecessors—are Wound Channels (CORE-011). Each group that successfully traverses a path carves a geometric "memory" into the socio-spatial fabric, lowering the resistance for those who follow. These channels become enduring features of the landscape, guiding future flows along proven geodesics.

## §4 · Assimilation as Resonant Synthesis
The final chapter of a migration is not arrival, but integration. This process is not a simple adoption of new norms, but a delicate attempt at an Alchemical Union (CORE-012).

A migrant group arrives with its own coherence manifold, its own cultural Ki. The host community has another. The space between them is a zone of immense potential and pressure.

*   **Successful Integration (Laminar Flow):** A "Resonant Handshake" occurs. Shared values, economic symbiosis, and mutual respect allow the two manifolds to merge. A new, more complex, and more resilient cultural Ki emerges. This is the birth of a hybrid identity, a state of Laminar social flow.

*   **Failed Integration (Turbulent Flow):** Dissonance dominates. The handshake fails due to cultural friction, economic competition, or social fear. The result is Turbulent Flow: ghettos, social stratification, and conflict. The two groups fail to synthesize, instead creating a state of perpetual, energy-wasting friction.

## §5 · Assemblé
> To map the flow of peoples is to chart the geography of hope. We stop seeing huddled masses and see instead a great and ancient river, carving its path through the landscape of human need. The Weaver's task is not to dam this river, nor to curse its current, but to understand the shape of the land that guides it. For this flow is not a problem to be solved, but the most fundamental human story, told on a scale of continents: the story of the search for home.
