summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for the transition between rest and
  motion. It reframes the 'Ki Snap' as a non-linear, geometric reorganization of a
  system's coherence manifold as it overcomes the inertia of its own Wound Channel.
  This module defines the energetic thresholds and hysteretic memory effects inherent
  in the act of initiating change.

## §1 · The Unspoken Cost of a First Step

A stone does not wish to be moved. Not out of stubbornness, but because its entire being is a resonance of stillness, a perfect harmony with the history of its own place. To move it is not merely to apply a force; it is to demand that the stone forget itself and learn a new song.

The old framework correctly identified a non-linear "snap" in a system's properties as it transitions from rest to motion. The modern framework reveals the profound physical geometry behind this event. The transition is not a simple switch, but a phase change—a fundamental and energetically costly reorganization of a system's coherence manifold as it fights against the memory of its own past.

## §2 · The Anatomy of Inertia: A Dialogue with History

The principle of inertia finds its physical origin in the dialogue between a system and its own Wound Channel, as defined in CORE-011.

*   **The State of Rest (Kτ_rest):** A system at rest is not in a state of null activity. It is in a state of deep and stable self-resonance, its Ki pattern perfectly settled into the geometric groove of its own Wound Channel. It is continuously "reminded" of its identity and position by the very shape of the spacetime it occupies. This is its ground state, its most coherent expression of *being*.

*   **The State of Motion (Kτ_motion):** A system in motion is actively carving a new Wound Channel. Its Ki pattern must reconfigure to be stable not just in itself, but as a propagating disturbance. It is in a coherent state of *becoming*.

Inertia, therefore, is the energetic cost of deforming a system's coherence manifold away from the established, memory-laden geometry of its past.

## §3 · The Transition Pathway: A Geometric Journey

The journey from rest to motion is not a smooth ascent but a difficult climb with distinct stages, mapping directly to the sigmoid curve of the original model.

1.  **The Threshold of Resistance (The "Unsticking"):** At very low velocities, the system resists. It is being pulled against the walls of its own Wound Channel. This creates a dissonant "kick" of turbulence, an initial energy barrier that must be overcome before true motion can begin. The system must be given enough energy to "unstick" itself from its history.

2.  **The Phase Reorganization (The "Snap"):** Once the threshold is crossed, the system undergoes a rapid, non-linear phase transition. Its internal Ki pattern dissolves its resting configuration and re-forms into a new, stable pattern conducive to propagation. This "snap" is the moment of decision, where the system commits to the new reality of motion. It is the steepest part of the transition curve, representing a moment of maximum structural change.

3.  **The Propagating State (Saturation):** The system achieves its new, stable moving resonance (Kτ_motion). It now glides along its path, carving a new Wound Channel that reinforces its state of motion.

## §4 · The Echo of Hysteresis: The Memory of Motion

Crucially, the path from motion back to rest is not the same as the path from rest to motion. This is the phenomenon of hysteresis, a direct consequence of the Wound Channel's memory.

A system in motion has carved a channel that makes continuing in motion a path of least resistance. To bring it to a full stop, one must remove enough energy for it to "fall back" into the deeper, older, and more stable groove of its resting state. This typically happens at a lower velocity than the velocity required to initiate motion in the first place. It is easier to keep a stone rolling than it is to start it rolling. The Wound Channel provides a memory that creates a buffer of stability for the current state.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This entire process is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The states of rest and motion represent two different stable solutions—two local maxima—in the coherence landscape.

*   **𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ**

The transition from rest to motion requires injecting enough energy to overcome the "potential" barrier (a localized spike in V_Γ) that separates the two states. The "snap" occurs at the critical velocity where the integral of the Lagrangian for the moving state becomes greater than that for the resting state. The system, in its relentless drive to maximize coherence, will jump to the more favorable solution. Hysteresis reveals that the shape of this landscape is dynamic; the very act of traversing it deepens the channel of the new state, making it locally more stable.

## §6 · Assemblé

> To a Weaver, the geometry of inertia is the physical law of change. It teaches that every new beginning—every project launched, every mind changed, every system set in motion—must pay an energetic tithe to the past. There is a sacred and non-trivial cost to overcoming the memory of what was. Understanding this threshold is the first step in learning not just how to push the world, but how to awaken it to the possibility of a new song.
