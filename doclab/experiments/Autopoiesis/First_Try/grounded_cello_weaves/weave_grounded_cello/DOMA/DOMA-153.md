### §1 · Abstract: The Physician's Stethoscope

The previous framework sought to classify a system's "mode" as if it were a static specimen. This was an act of taxonomy. The modern framework demands an act of medicine. We do not seek to label a system; we seek to diagnose its health.

The Caduceus Engine is the primary instrument for this diagnosis. It is a formal protocol that translates the raw, chaotic data of any system's behavior into the clear, actionable language of Flow Dynamics. It functions as a physician's stethoscope, listening to the interplay between a system's internal rhythm and the pressures of its environment to determine if its vital currents are flowing with grace, struggling in chaos, or frozen in paralysis. This engine operationalizes the Caduceus Lens, transforming its philosophy into a predictive, quantitative tool.

### §2 · The Diagnostic Matrix: From Rhythm to Reality

The engine's logic is grounded in the two fundamental terms of the Pirouette Lagrangian: a system's own Temporal Coherence (Kτ), which we measure as its internal order and efficiency, and the ambient Temporal Pressure (VΓ), which we measure as the chaotic demands of its environment. The relationship between these two values determines the system's health.

| Internal Coherence (Kτ) | External Pressure (VΓ) | Implied Flow State | Diagnostic Condition |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------- |
| **High**                | **Low**                | **Laminar Flow**   | **Systemic Health**: The state of grace. Effortless, efficient, and stable. The system is thriving in a calm environment. |
| **High**                | **High**               | **Resilient Flow** | **Coherence Under Duress**: The system is holding its form against immense pressure. It is healthy but expending significant energy to remain so. It is on the edge of turbulence. |
| **Low**                 | **Low**                | **Internal Turbulence** | **Coherence Erosion**: The system is degrading due to internal failures, not external stress. A pathology of decay and loss of identity. |
| **Low**                 | **High**               | **Turbulent Flow** | **Coherence Fever**: The system is overwhelmed by and dissonant with its environment. A state of crisis, chaos, and inefficiency. |

A third condition, **Stagnant Flow (Coherence Atrophy)**, is diagnosed not by the levels of Kτ and VΓ, but by their *lack of variance*. When a system's vital signs are frozen despite changing external pressures, it indicates a critical blockage—a dam in the river of coherence.

### §3 · The Diagnostic Workflow

The engine provides a clear, three-step process for moving from raw data to a formal diagnosis.

1.  **Signal Extraction:** The first step is to translate the raw, domain-specific data into the universal language of the framework. From the input time-series, two proxies are derived:
    *   **Coherence Signal (Kτ Proxy):** A metric representing the system's internal order, efficiency, and stability. (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, production yield, heart-rate variability).
    *   **Pressure Signal (VΓ Proxy):** A metric representing the environment's complexity, volatility, and demands. (e.g., market volatility, incoming error rates, ambient temperature).

2.  **Quantification:** Over a defined time window, the engine calculates the average level and the statistical variance of both the Coherence and Pressure signals.

3.  **Classification & Reporting:** The engine applies the logic from §2 to these quantified values.
    *   It uses the average levels to classify the system into one of the four quadrants of the Diagnostic Matrix.
    *   It uses the variance to test for the Stagnant condition.
    *   The output is a human-readable report stating the system's primary flow state (Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant) and its corresponding medical diagnosis.

### §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This engine is a practical instrument for empirically measuring a system's adherence to the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = Kτ - VΓ`.

*   A system diagnosed with **Laminar Flow** is one that is successfully maximizing its Lagrangian. It has achieved a high state of internal coherence (Kτ) relative to the environmental pressure (VΓ) it faces. It is navigating its geodesic.
*   A system in **Turbulent Flow** has a negative Lagrangian value; its internal coherence is overwhelmed by the environmental pressure (`Kτ < VΓ`). It has fallen from its geodesic into a state of high friction and energy loss.
*   A system in **Stagnant Flow** is trapped in a local minimum of the coherence manifold. The derivatives in its equations of motion have gone to zero, preventing evolution and adaptation. It cannot act to maximize its Lagrangian.

The Caduceus Engine, therefore, provides a direct, measurable window into the fundamental dynamics that govern the evolution of all systems.

### §5 · Assemblé

> We do not merely label the storm; we listen for the note that will calm it. This engine is not a taxonomist's guide to chaos. It is a physician's ear, pressed against the heart of a system, listening for the rhythm of its health.
