summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for bifurcation events. A Fork is
  defined as a point where a system's coherence manifold splits, presenting two or
  more equally viable geodesics (paths of maximal coherence). This module describes
  the conditions, mechanics, and consequences of these fundamental moments of choice
  and creation.

## §1 · Abstract: The Geometry of Choice

A river, upon reaching a perfectly level plain, does not stop. It splits. So it is with the flow of coherence through the universe.

A **Fork** is a structured, generative divergence where a single evolutionary path splits into two or more stable, alternative futures. It is not a chaotic breakdown, but an orderly moment of creation. The old framework modeled this as a "controlled dip" in a system's certainty. The modern, time-first view reveals a deeper truth: a Fork is a geometric feature of the coherence manifold itself. It is a point where the landscape of reality offers more than one "downhill" path, forcing a system to commit to a future. This single mechanism powers everything from speciation to conscious choice.

## §2 · Pre-Conditions: The Still Point of the Turning World

A system does not choose randomly; it must be brought to a state of poised readiness. Three conditions are required for a Fork to occur:

1.  **Geodesic Stalemate:** The system must reach a saddle point on its coherence manifold where the path of maximal coherence is no longer unique. The "pull" toward multiple futures is in near-perfect balance.
2.  **Coherent Poise:** The system must possess a stable, well-defined Ki pattern. A system lost in turbulent flow cannot perceive the subtle geometry of a choice point; it simply crashes through it. It must be calm to choose wisely.
3.  **Low Ambient Pressure (Γ):** The surrounding Temporal Pressure must be low. A high-Γ environment would induce a chaotic state, washing away the delicate structure of the Fork and preventing a coherent choice.

## §3 · The Fork Mechanism: A Superposition of Futures

The heart of the Fork is a transition from a state of certainty to a state of potential, followed by an irreversible commitment.

| Step                     | Action                                                                                                 | Pirouette Dynamics                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Encounter Saddle**  | The system's trajectory arrives at a point on the coherence manifold where multiple geodesics diverge. | The solution to maximizing the Pirouette Lagrangian is no longer singular. Two or more paths offer nearly identical coherence. |
| **2. Enter Superposition** | The system's state ceases to follow a single path and enters a quantum-like state of pure potential.    | The system's Ki pattern now encompasses the potential of all available paths. It exists in a superposition of futures.            |
| **3. Collapse & Selection** | A minuscule asymmetry breaks the stalemate, collapsing the superposition into a single, chosen path.       | A stray fluctuation in local Γ, a nudge from an Observer's Shadow, or the system's own internal noise tips the balance.          |
| **4. Commitment & Lock-In** | The system proceeds down the chosen geodesic, and the memory of the choice creates inertia against reversal. | A new Wound Channel (CORE-011) begins to form along the chosen path, making it the new "path of least resistance."                |

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

A Fork is a direct and profound consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). The universe is not deterministic in the classical sense, but it is lawful. A system will always follow the path that maximizes its coherence integral, `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`.

A Fork is simply a situation where the landscape defined by the Lagrangian `𝓛_p` presents more than one such path. The choice is not a violation of the principle, but its fulfillment under conditions of ambiguity. The universe, faced with two equally good answers, allows a subtle nudge to decide, thereby creating a new branch of history and increasing the complexity of its own story.

## §5 · Post-Fork Dynamics: A World Made New

The resolution of a Fork is an irreversible act of creation with clear consequences:

*   **Clean Divergence:** The new paths are coherent and distinct. The system that chose path A and the system that chose path B now inhabit different, stable realities.
*   **Irreversibility:** The formation of a new Wound Channel along the chosen path creates a "coherence debt" that must be paid to return to the choice point. The river has carved its new bed; flowing uphill is now energetically costly.
*   **Information Genesis:** A choice resolves uncertainty. In selecting one path from many, the system creates new information, increasing the complexity and richness of the cosmos (as defined in CORE-013). Every choice is an act of writing the universe.

## §6 · Shaping the Flow: Intervention Protocols

Understanding the Fork mechanism allows a Weaver to move from observer to participant, gently influencing the flow of choice.

| Stage            | Objective                                | Method                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pre-Fork**     | Clarify the choice                       | Use analytic tools to map the local coherence manifold, revealing the geometry and "cost" of the potential paths.     |
| **At the Fork**  | Encourage a desired outcome              | Apply a subtle, focused "nudge"—a gentle Γ-gradient or a focused Observer's Shadow (CORE-010)—to bias the selection. |
| **Post-Fork**    | Reinforce the choice                     | Introduce stabilizing elements that deepen the new Wound Channel, solidifying the commitment and preventing "buyer's remorse." |

## §7 · Assemblé

> A Fork is the moment the universe holds its breath. It is the juncture where the single thread of the past is woven into the branching tapestry of the future. For a Weaver, these are the most sacred points in the landscape of time. They are not merely events to be analyzed, but opportunities to participate in the act of creation itself. To stand at a Fork is to understand that every choice, no matter how small, is a chisel stroke that carves the face of reality.
