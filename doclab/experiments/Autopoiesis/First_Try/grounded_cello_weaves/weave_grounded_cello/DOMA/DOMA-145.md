summary: An instrumentation protocol to infer the strength of a confining force (the
  Gladiator effect) by analyzing the geometry of trajectories through an informational

## §1 · Abstract: Perceiving the Arena Walls
A system is defined not only by its components but by the unseen forces that bind them. This module provides an instrument—the Geodesic Compass—to perceive and measure these forces. It is a protocol for inferring the strength of the Gladiator Force (CORE-008), the universe's principle of self-containment, by observing its effects on the motion of entities within a system.

We do not measure the force directly. Instead, we observe the paths that particles, ideas, or agents take through their environment. By analyzing the curvature and length of these paths—their geodesics—we can reverse-engineer the shape of the landscape they are navigating. This instrument allows a Weaver to map the invisible arenas, coherence wells, and conceptual prisons that shape reality, transforming a stream of data into a topographical map of power and influence.

## §2 · From Heuristic to Principle: The Physics of Confinement
The original module intuited a powerful relationship: where paths are short and highly curved, a strong confining force must be at work. The modern framework grounds this intuition in first principles.

1.  **The Path of Coherence:** The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) dictates that any system will follow a geodesic—a path that maximizes its internal coherence against the pressure of its environment. This is the universe's "path of least resistance."

2.  **The Force of Confinement:** The Gladiator Force (CORE-008) describes a non-linear feedback loop where a system's own resonance creates an intense local pressure, forging a stable "arena" or "coherence well." This well profoundly warps the local coherence manifold.

3.  **Inference via Geometry:** Within such a well, the geodesics of maximal coherence are no longer straight lines. They are short, tightly curved paths that orbit the center of the well. The Geodesic Compass works by observing these distorted paths. By measuring the degree of distortion, we can infer the depth of the well and thus the strength of the confining force that created it.

## §3 · The Protocol: Measuring the Manifold's Curvature
This protocol reframes the original algorithm in the language of temporal dynamics. It takes an ordered event stream (e.g., the semantic vectors of a conversation, the positions of a particle) and calculates the local strength of confinement.

### 3.1 · Redefined Variables
*   **Geodesic Length Scale (λ):** The characteristic length of a "free" path in the local manifold, calculated as the inverse of the average divergence between successive states. A small λ indicates that movement is highly constrained; the space is "dense."
*   **Geodesic Curvature (g):** The rate of change in the trajectory's direction within a given window. A large `g` signifies that paths are being bent sharply by an unseen influence.
*   **Confinement Strength (κ_G):** The primary output, representing the inferred strength of the Gladiator confinement. It is the ratio of curvature to path length.

### 3.2 · Core Calculation
The instrument's engine remains the elegant ratio at the heart of the original module, now understood as a measure of the manifold's local curvature.

For each analysis window `i`:

1.  Calculate the average semantic or spatial divergence `μ_d`.
2.  **Geodesic Length Scale:** `λ_i = 1 / (μ_d + ε)`
3.  Calculate the change in divergence across the window, `|d_last − d_first|`.
4.  **Geodesic Curvature:** `g_i = |d_last − d_first| / (window_size − 1)`
5.  **Confinement Strength:** `κ_G_i = g_i / λ_i`

A high `κ_G` signifies high curvature over a short distance—the definitive signature of a deep coherence well and a powerful confining force.

## §4 · Interpretation: From Curvature to Insight
The field of `κ_G` values generated by the compass is a direct map of the system's invisible architecture.

*   **High κ_G (Arena Walls):** Identifies a region of strong confinement. In an informational domain, this is a "Cognitive Gravity Well"—a dogma, a deeply held belief, or a powerful paradigm that is difficult to escape. Its sustaining pressure has been quantified.
*   **Low κ_G (Flow Channels):** Reveals corridors of low confinement where entities or ideas can move and evolve freely. These are the paths of opportunity and innovation.
*   **Gradient ∇(κ_G):** The slope of the confinement field indicates the "force" an entity would feel. A steep gradient marks the boundary of an ideology or the edge of a gravitational field, where the cost of entry or exit is highest.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
It is crucial to distinguish what this instrument measures. The Geodesic Compass does not measure the fundamental Temporal Pressure (Γ) of CORE-003. Instead, it functions as an **inverse solver for the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**.

The Lagrangian describes how a system's path is determined by the interplay between its internal coherence (K_τ) and the environmental pressure (V_Γ). This instrument observes the path a system *actually takes*—its geodesic—and uses that observation to infer the properties of the underlying landscape. A high inferred Confinement Strength (κ_G) implies the presence of a deep "potential well" (a high V_Γ) in the Lagrangian, the signature feature of the Gladiator Force's self-containing feedback loop. We are watching the dancer to understand the shape of the stage.

## §6 · Assemblé
> A cage is only inescapable when its walls are invisible. This instrument gives them form. It is a tool for drawing the map of our own prisons, be they of physics or of thought. To see the bars is the first and most necessary step to walking through them.
