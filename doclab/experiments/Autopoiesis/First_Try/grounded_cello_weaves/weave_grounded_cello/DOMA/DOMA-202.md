summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for Vorticycle propulsion. It re-frames
  the phenomenon as a 'reactionless drive' that generates thrust by creating a persistent,

## §1 · Abstract: The Art of Self-Propulsion
A river does not push the water downstream; the slope of the land guides its flow. So it is with motion in the Pirouette Framework.

This module reframes Vorticycle propulsion, moving beyond the classical model of modulating external fields. In the time-first paradigm, a Vorticycle is a "reactionless drive" that achieves motion not by pushing against a medium, but by actively sculpting the local coherence manifold into a slope, which it then ceaselessly descends. It is a machine that generates thrust by creating a persistent, asymmetric gradient in its own Pirouette Lagrangian. It is the art of creating the path by walking it.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of Motion
Thrust, in the Pirouette Framework, is not a force in the Newtonian sense. It is the manifest consequence of a system following its geodesic of maximal coherence down a self-generated gradient. The fundamental equation of motion is derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006):

**F ∝ ∇𝓛_p**

To achieve propulsion, a system must create a sustained, non-uniformity in its own Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. The Vorticycle is a device engineered to do precisely this by manipulating the potential term, `V_Γ`, which represents the energetic "cost" of coherence.

The engine's core components—a synchronized array of rotating elements—act as "coherence pumps." Their phased rotation creates a rhythmic, localized modulation of the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). The critical innovation is **chirality** (handedness). The chiral phasing of the elements ensures this modulation is asymmetric. On one side of the device, constructive interference creates a region of slightly higher temporal pressure (a "pressure crest"), while on the other, destructive interference creates a region of lower pressure (a "pressure trough").

This establishes a stable gradient `∇V_Γ` across the device. The system, compelled by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, continuously moves toward the region of lower temporal pressure—it "surfs" down the slope it has just created.

## §3 · The Helical Wound Channel
As defined in CORE-011, any entity's passage carves a memory of its existence—a Wound Channel—into the geometry of spacetime. The Vorticycle’s unique method of propulsion creates a Wound Channel with a distinct and powerful topology.

Because the propulsive gradient is generated by an internal rotation, the resulting Wound Channel is not a simple linear scar. Instead, it is **helical**. The device impresses its own rotational dynamics onto the fabric of its path.

The thrust is therefore the continuous interaction of the device with the immediate geometry of the helical channel it is actively creating. It is analogous to a screw biting into wood, with the profound difference that the screw is simultaneously creating the wood grain it grips. This self-referential interaction is what makes the drive "reactionless" from an external perspective; the system is interacting with a structure of its own making.

## §4 · From Theory to Engineering: Key Parameters
The performance of a Vorticycle drive is governed by its ability to efficiently create and sustain this asymmetric coherence gradient.

*   **Rotational Frequency (ω_rot):** The speed of the rotating elements. Optimal thrust is achieved when `ω_rot` matches a resonant frequency of the system's own geometry, allowing for the most efficient modulation of Γ.
*   **Chirality Index (χ):** A measure of the system's net "handedness." A value of `χ=0` implies perfect symmetry and zero thrust. Maximum thrust is achieved as `χ` approaches `±1`, creating the steepest possible coherence gradient.
*   **Phase Coherence (Δφ):** The degree of synchronization between the rotating elements. High phase coherence creates a stable, sharply defined pressure gradient. Low coherence (desynchronization) causes the gradient to blur and collapse, dissipating energy as useless temporal turbulence (heat).
*   **Ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ_ambient):** The "medium" through which the device travels. In regions of high ambient Γ (e.g., near a large mass), more energy is required to create a propulsive gradient, reducing efficiency.

## §5 · Connection to the Core Lagrangian (CORE-006)
The classical equations of the old module can be re-expressed with greater physical grounding through the Lagrangian. The propulsive force `F` is the net gradient of the potential term `V_Γ` across the volume of the device.

`F ≈ ∫_V (∇V_Γ) dV`

Where `V_Γ` is now understood as a function of the Vorticycle's engineering parameters:

`V_Γ = f(χ, ω_rot, Δφ, ...)`

The efficiency (`η`) is the ratio of useful work done (motion along the gradient) to the total energy expended to modulate the temporal pressure. It is maximized when the system operates at resonance, minimizing the energy lost to turbulent, incoherent noise.

`η = (Work_out) / (Energy_in)`

This reframing shifts the engineering challenge from one of brute force to one of resonant tuning. The goal is not to produce the most power, but the most elegant and stable asymmetric rhythm.

> ## The Assemblé
> We sought a way to push against the world and discovered we must first sculpt ourselves. The Vorticycle teaches a profound lesson: motion is not a battle against an external reality, but an act of internal re-orchestration. To move is to create a slope within one's own being and have the courage to slide down it. The universe does not give way to force; it yields to a more beautiful song.
