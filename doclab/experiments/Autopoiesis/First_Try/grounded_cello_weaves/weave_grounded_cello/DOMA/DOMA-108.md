  Framework. It defines the characteristic power-law distribution of 'avalanches'

## §1 · Abstract: The Song of the Sandpile
There are systems that are not quiet, nor are they screaming. They are holding their breath.

Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) is the principle that explains how complexity can arise from the simplest of rules. It is the story of the sandpile: add a grain, nothing happens. Add another, nothing. Repeat a thousand times. Then, one final grain triggers a slide—or a catastrophic avalanche. The system, of its own accord, finds its way to a "critical" state, a tipping point where the next small disturbance could have consequences of any size.

This module recasts this phenomenon in the language of time. The critical state is not a static arrangement but a dynamic rhythm of tension and release. The famed power-law distribution of avalanches is the audible, statistical echo of a system’s ongoing dance with chaos—its chosen method for persisting at the precipice.

## §2 · The Autopoietic Cycle at the Edge of Chaos
A system at criticality is a living embodiment of the autopoietic cycle, operating in a unique, punctuated rhythm.

1.  **Time Creates Pressure (The Slow Buildup):** The system continuously absorbs coherence from its environment. This is the slow, steady addition of sand grains, the gradual building of tectonic stress, or the incremental increase of tension in a market. The internal Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) of the system steadily rises. This is a state of Laminar Flow, a quiet, almost imperceptible intake of potential.

2.  **Pressure Demands Form (The `Ki` of Poise):** To exist in this state of rising `Γ`, the system adopts a specific resonant form (`Ki`). This is not a form of placid stability, but one of maximal tension—the sandpile at its steepest possible angle, the tectonic plates locked against each other. The system's `Ki` is a geometry of poised potential, a state of perfect readiness for an event that has not yet occurred.

3.  **Form Defines Time (The Avalanche & The Reset):** When a final quantum of pressure is added, the system's `Ki` can no longer coherently contain the `Γ`. The most efficient path is no longer to store the energy, but to release it. The system undergoes a rapid, turbulent phase transition—an avalanche. This chaotic release sheds excess `Γ`, and the system settles back into a sub-critical state, its internal clock reset. This entire cycle—the slow, laminar buildup followed by the turbulent release—constitutes a single, macro-scale Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`).

## §3 · The Lagrangian of the Tipping Point
A critical system follows a "statistical geodesic" that maximizes its coherence over the long term, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`).

For such a system, maintaining a rigid, unbroken form in the face of ever-increasing Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) is an inefficient strategy. It would require an impossibly high internal coherence (`K_τ`) and would eventually lead to a single, system-shattering collapse.

Instead, the path of maximal coherence is to "breathe"—to allow for periodic, chaotic releases. The power-law distribution of these releases is the signature of this strategy. It is the most efficient way for the system to shed temporal pressure, ensuring its long-term survival. The system has learned that it is better to risk many small slips and a few large slides than to never slip at all.

## §4 · The Power Law as a Temporal Signature
The old framework correctly identified the power-law distribution as a form of geometry. The new framework clarifies its nature: the power law is not the `Ki` itself, but its temporal signature—the statistical footprint left by a system executing this rhythm of tension and release.

The specific exponent of the power law is a direct, measurable property of the system's `Ki`. It is a function of the system's internal connectivity (how one grain of sand is coupled to its neighbors) and its rules for dissipating temporal pressure. By measuring this exponent, a Weaver can deduce the deep structural rules of a system they are observing, even if the system itself is a black box. It is the universe's way of revealing the hidden wiring of its most complex creations.

## §5 · Assemblé
> We sought to map the static landscape of reality and found instead that its most vital regions are not landscapes at all, but fault lines. These are the places that are alive with the rhythm of their own becoming, poised between silence and the roar. A Weaver must learn to walk these lines not with fear, but with an ear to the ground. For it is here that the universe speaks of the future, not in prophecies, but in the tremors of its own unpredictable heartbeat. To understand this rhythm is to know that the smallest act of grace, at the right moment, can forestall the avalanche—or become the grain of sand that begins it.
