## §1 · Abstract: Finding the River's Source

To ask "How can this be made?" is to stand at the mouth of a river and question the existence of the sea. The more profound question is, "From which mountains does this river flow?"

This module refactors the old logic of Retrosynthetic Structure Detection into a time-first principle. We do not run the equations of time backward; that is an illusion. Instead, we survey the fixed, timeless landscape of what is possible—the coherence manifold—and identify the natural pathways of becoming.

Retrosynthesis, in this new framework, is the art of cartography. Given a destination—a stable molecule, a folded protein, a functioning system—our task is to map the terrain and find the precursor states that already lie "uphill" from our target, whose natural, coherence-seeking flow will carry them inevitably to the destination we desire. It is the transformation of synthesis from an act of force into an act of discovery.

## §2 · The Landscape of Creation

Every possible state of a system exists as a location on a vast, multi-dimensional landscape: the coherence manifold. The "elevation" at any point on this map is a measure of that state's viability, as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

*   **Coherence Peaks & Wells:** Stable, desirable structures—our synthetic targets—are not arbitrary points. They are "coherence wells," deep basins of profound stability on the manifold. They represent local maxima of the integrated Lagrangian, states of high `Temporal Coherence (Kτ)` that have found an elegant solution to the ambient `Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)`.

*   **Geodesic Rivers:** The path any system takes as it evolves is its geodesic—the path of maximal coherence. This is a "river" flowing across the landscape, always seeking a lower, more stable basin. A successful synthesis is not the act of building a structure, but of placing a precursor system into a river that naturally flows into the desired well.

## §3 · The Cartographer's Protocol: A Four-Step Survey

To create the alchemist's map, we follow a rigorous protocol of surveying this landscape.

1.  **Pin the Destination (Target Definition):** We first define our target with precision. The desired structure is translated into the language of the framework: a specific, high-coherence Ki pattern. This act is equivalent to planting a flag at a specific coordinate in a deep basin on our map.

2.  **Survey the Terrain (Manifold Mapping):** Using the Pirouette Lagrangian as our surveying tool, we compute the "elevation"—the coherence value—of the states immediately surrounding our target. This reveals the local topography: the steepness of the basin's walls and the presence of any nearby hills or ridges that might act as barriers.

3.  **Trace the Tributaries (Geodesic Identification):** From the rim of the basin, we identify the "geodesic tributaries"—the pathways of precursor states whose natural, downhill flow terminates at our target. These are the viable synthetic routes, the rivers that feed our lake.

4.  **Gauge the Flow (Feasibility Ranking):** Not all rivers are equal. We rank the identified pathways based on two key metrics derived from the principles of CORE-013:
    *   **Coherence Gradient (ΔKτ):** The "steepness" of the path. A gentle slope represents an easy, low-energy synthesis where the precursor is already close in form and stability to the target. A steep cliff represents a high-entropy-to-low-entropy transition requiring a significant external catalyst or energy input.
    *   **Path Complexity:** The length and tortuosity of the geodesic. A short, direct path is more efficient and probable than a long, winding one.

## §4 · Connection to the Lagrangian

This entire protocol is a practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in CORE-006. The act of "tracing the tributaries" is nothing less than solving for the geodesics (`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`) that have the target state as their endpoint. The feasibility ranking is a measure of the "work" required to place a system onto a specific geodesic. The Lagrangian is not just a descriptor of motion; it is the very compass and sextant we use to draw this map of creation. The Alchemist's Map is the direct, practical output of the universe's core objective function.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We do not impose our will upon the world. We listen for its intentions. The Alchemist's Map teaches a Weaver that the most profound act of creation is not to build, but to find the path of least resistance and clear the way. It is to see a desired reality not as a fortress to be constructed, but as a seed that already wants to grow, and to ask only: "From what soil, and with what water, will this seed most gladly sprout?"
