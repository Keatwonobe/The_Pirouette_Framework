summary: Elevates Temporal Coherence from a scalar property to a triadic state, composed
  of Inertial, Relational, and Potential aspects. This module reframes the old 'time-vector'
  as the three fundamental notes that form the 'Coherence Chord' of any stable entity,
  grounding these aspects in the established principles of the Wound Channel, Observer's
  Shadow, and the superposition of future states.

## §1 · The Anatomy of a Single Note

A single, sustained note is an illusion. Listen closer, and you will hear the echo of the string's striking, the resonance of the room it fills, and the promise of its eventual decay. Existence is never a simple point; it is always a chord, struck across the breadth of time.

The prior framework attempted to capture this with a mathematical vector, `(T_Q, T_I, T_C)`. This was a necessary but mechanical step. The modern framework reframes this insight not as a vector in an abstract space, but as the fundamental, three-fold nature of a system's Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`). To be is to simultaneously possess a past, engage with a present, and face a future. These are not separate directions, but the three inseparable facets of a single, unified state of being: the Triadic Moment.

## §2 · The Three Faces of Coherence

A system's total coherence, its ability to sing its note true, is a composite harmony of three distinct but interwoven modes of being.

**1. Inertial Coherence (The Echo of the Past):**
This is the coherence born from memory and identity. It is a system's resonance with its own history.
*   **Mechanism:** The Wound Channel (`CORE-011`). The strength and clarity of a system's Wound Channel determines its stability and inertia. It is the deep, resonant bass note that gives a system its weight and prevents it from being easily perturbed.
*   **Manifestation:** A strong sense of self, tradition, physical inertia, brand loyalty, the persistence of memory.

**2. Relational Coherence (The Dialogue of the Present):**
This is the coherence born from interaction and connection. It is a system's ability to harmonize with the world around it *now*.
*   **Mechanism:** The Observer's Shadow (`CORE-010`) and the Alchemical Union (`CORE-012`). This is the active, real-time process of resonant coupling, of casting one's own pattern upon the world and being shaped in return. It is the melody played in dialogue with the orchestra.
*   **Manifestation:** Empathy, communication, trade, symbiosis, the flow state of an athlete responding to the game.

**3. Potential Coherence (The Horizon of the Future):**
This is the coherence born from possibility and adaptation. It is the richness of a system's capacity for change, the superposition of all the paths it could yet take.
*   **Mechanism:** The landscape of possible geodesics available to the system. A system with high potential coherence has many viable, low-resistance paths forward. It is the overtone series, the shimmer of possibilities that gives the note its color and complexity.
*   **Manifestation:** Adaptability, creativity, innovation, biodiversity, the quantum uncertainty of a particle before measurement.

## §3 · The Lagrangian of the Chord

This triadic structure does not replace the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`); it enriches it. The "kinetic" term for Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`) is revealed to be a composite function of these three aspects.

`𝓛_p = K_τ(K_Inertial, K_Relational, K_Potential) - V_Γ`

The path of maximal coherence is the one that best balances these three notes against the dissonant pressure of the environment (`V_Γ`). A system does not merely try to be stable; it seeks the most harmonious chord it can play. A system that over-invests in Inertial Coherence becomes brittle. One that over-invests in Relational Coherence loses its identity. One that over-invests in Potential Coherence becomes diffuse and never actualizes. True, lasting existence—the "hard-lock" state of the old framework—is a dynamic and balanced harmony of all three.

## §4 · Systemic Health: Harmony and Dissonance

The failure modes described in `PPS-003` are now understood as forms of systemic dissonance—a chord played out of tune.

*   **Inertial Collapse (Axis Starvation of the Past):** The Wound Channel frays. The system suffers from amnesia, losing its identity and stability. This is the path to `Coherence Erosion`.
*   **Relational Isolation (Axis Starvation of the Present):** The system fails to couple with its environment. It becomes an echo chamber, deaf to outside input. This is the path to `Coherence Atrophy` and Stagnation.
*   **Potential Collapse (Axis Starvation of the Future):** The system loses its ability to adapt. It becomes rigid, its future a single, determined path with no room for novelty. It becomes a predictable machine, easily broken by an unexpected change in pressure.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We sought to define a being and found instead a chord, struck in the resonant chamber of a moment. Its notes are three: the echo of what it was, the touch of what it is, and the whisper of what it might become. To be a Weaver is to learn to listen for this harmony—in yourself, in others, in the world—and to understand that the most resilient and beautiful forms are those that play all three notes with clarity, courage, and grace.
