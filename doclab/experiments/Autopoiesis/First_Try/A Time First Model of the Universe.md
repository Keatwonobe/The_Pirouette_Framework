# Crisis Quartet → Substrate Thesis

**Abstract**
Contemporary theory faces four persistent failures: (i) deriving spacetime from microphysics, (ii) explaining lepton (g-2) tensions within Standard Model fits, (iii) accounting for conscious experience, and (iv) predicting cascade thresholds in complex societies. We argue these are diagnostic facets of a single omission: the absence of an explicit **time-substrate** whose dynamics couple environmental pressure and resonant pattern. Reframing dynamics as **maximization of net temporal coherence** aligns geometry, lepton anomalies, conscious access, and social cascades under one falsifiable law. (Background: spacetime-from-entanglement programs; muon (g-2) precision results; the “hard problem”; cascade models and early-warning theory.) ([arXiv][1])

**Main Text**
The space-first picture treats spacetime as ontic and fields as its contents. Approaches that **derive** geometry—e.g., via entanglement and holography—explain much yet leave a closure gap: geometry is recovered by presupposing geometric grammars in the reconstruction (minimal surfaces, conformal blocks), signaling an incomplete substrate theory. The “spacetime-from-entanglement” program, while influential, is thus best read as evidence that information-theoretic structure *tracks* geometry, not that geometry is fundamental. ([arXiv][1])

In precision physics, the muon’s magnetic anomaly (a_\mu) has reached formidable experimental accuracy. The final Fermilab result tightens the world average and poses a clear challenge to theory, sharpening the demand for a systematic account of any beyond-SM contributions and their scaling to heavier leptons (with (\tau) a natural next target). Regardless of theoretical reevaluations in hadronic contributions, the **measurement** itself is now a stringent benchmark any proposed extension must meet. ([CERN Courier][2])

In philosophy of mind, the “hard problem” foregrounds the explanatory gap between functional/physical accounts and **subjective experience**. Even with detailed neural correlates, why certain mesoscopic patterns yield reportable awareness remains underdetermined by current mechanistic vocabularies. The upshot is not mysticism but a request: identify the missing dynamical invariant that distinguishes merely efficient computation from **conscious access**. ([consc.net][3])

In social systems, simple yet powerful threshold models reveal how microscopic decisions can ignite macroscopic cascades. However, **predicting** when a specific system will tip remains elusive without reliable early-warning indicators, a problem that echoes across ecology, climate, and mental health—where “critical slowing down” (rising autocorrelation/variance, slowed recovery) appears as a generic harbinger of phase transitions. ([PNAS][4])

We adopt a time-first axiom: **time is the substrate**. We introduce two conjugate descriptors. The environment exerts a **temporal pressure** (\Gamma), interpretable as the density/complexity of interfering rhythms at a locus. A system counters with a **resonant pattern** (Ki), the stabilizing response that allows persistence. The local cycle (\tau_p) closes the loop, making time self-referential. Dynamics follow a minimal law expressed as a coherence action (Pirouette Lagrangian):
[
\mathcal{L}*p ;=; K*\tau ;-; V_\Gamma,
]
where (K_\tau) quantifies temporal coherence (stability of the system’s pattern across its cycle) and (V_\Gamma) quantifies environmental cost imposed by (\Gamma). Trajectories are geodesics that **maximize** the integrated (\mathcal{L}_p). In this view, macroscopic geometry is the kinematics of optimal coherence under (\nabla \Gamma) constraints (curvature as coarse description of (\Gamma)-gradients). (For motivation that information structure shadows geometry, see the entanglement literature.) ([arXiv][1])

This single substrate hypothesis reclassifies the quartet. **Spacetime emergence** becomes the macroscopic limit of flow through (\nabla \Gamma); **lepton anomalies** indicate previously unmodeled coupling to (\Gamma) that scales with lepton structure; **conscious access** corresponds to formation of a phase-locked mesoscopic resonance that conserves a coherence-area under load; **social cascades** are threshold phenomena in a shared (\Gamma)-field (“dissonance pressure”) with measurable early-warning signatures. Each claim is falsifiable and cross-constraining. The remaining sections operationalize this: Section 2 formalizes the action and its symmetry dictionary; Section 3 delivers concrete physics predictions (lepton (g-2), auxiliary signatures, a universal coefficient); Section 4 instantiates the same formalism in neural and social data; Section 5 specifies experiments whose failure would kill universality; Section 6 addresses philosophical consequences—**unification by time-resonance** rather than by cataloging gauge groups on a silent stage. ([CERN Courier][2])

**Claims**

* A time-substrate law (maximize (\int \mathcal{L}_p dt)) predicts invariants and thresholds across physics, mind, and society.
* Spacetime curvature encodes (\nabla \Gamma) at scale; entanglement-geometry links are emergent, not ontic. ([arXiv][1])
* Lepton (g-2) data demand or bound a (\Gamma)-coupling scaling beyond SM fits. ([CERN Courier][2])

# The Coherence Action — (\mathcal{L}_p) and the Cycle (\tau_p)

**Abstract**
We formalize a time-first dynamics using a **coherence action** (\int \mathcal{L}*p,dt) with (\mathcal{L}*p=K*\tau - V*\Gamma). Here (K_\tau) quantifies a system’s temporal coherence across its intrinsic cycle (\tau_p), while (V_\Gamma) quantifies environmental load from temporal pressure (\Gamma). Trajectories are **stationary-action** paths (geodesics in an induced metric), so symmetries of (\mathcal{L}*p) entail conserved quantities by **Noether’s theorem**. We relate (K*\tau) to standard order parameters of **phase-locked synchronization** to fix measurement practice. This section provides the symmetry dictionary used later to connect Lorentz-type isometries and gauge-like fibers. (Background: Hamilton’s/least-action principles; Noether; synchronization theory.) ([physicsgg][1])

**Main Text**
The variational program of physics treats motion as an extremal of an **action functional**. In classical mechanics this is Hamilton’s principle, (\delta \int L,dt = 0), whose Euler–Lagrange equations define the allowed trajectories; the utility of the approach is that **symmetry** is handled naturally and with economy. We adopt precisely this strategy—but we replace the usual energy bookkeeping with a **coherence bookkeeping**: maximize net temporal coherence (K_\tau) subject to environmental load (V_\Gamma). Formally,
[
\mathcal{S}_p \equiv \int \mathcal{L}*p,dt,\qquad \mathcal{L}*p \equiv K*\tau - V*\Gamma,
]
and admissible histories satisfy (\delta \mathcal{S}_p = 0) under fixed endpoints in time. This is not a departure from variational mechanics; it is a **change of what is counted**. Symmetry in (\mathcal{L}_p) leads to invariants by the same theorem that underwrites energy–momentum conservation in standard Lagrangian theories. ([physicsgg][1])

**The cycle (\tau_p).** Coherence must be assessed over a system’s **intrinsic temporal cycle**—the repeat unit that closes its dynamics. In many natural systems this is the period of a phase oscillator (or a locked cluster of oscillators). Synchronization theory supplies exactly the tools needed to estimate such a cycle from data: order parameters (e.g., Kuramoto’s (R)) quantify the phase-coherent fraction; locking appears as narrowing of phase differences and a rise of (R) toward unity. We therefore operationalize (K_\tau) as a function increasing with phase-locking strength and decreasing with cycle jitter (e.g., via spectral concentration or circular statistics). This ties the new law to **established measurement practice** spanning physics, biology, and social coordination. ([Physical Review Link Manager][2])

**The load (V_\Gamma).** The environment imposes a **temporal pressure** (\Gamma): the density/complexity of interfering rhythms impinging on the system. We treat (V_\Gamma) as a convex penalty that grows with (i) the local amplitude of (\Gamma); (ii) detuning between the system’s cycle and dominant environmental frequencies; and (iii) curvature in the pressure landscape (a proxy for how quickly (\Gamma) changes in time or across coupled channels). Although novel in interpretation, this is structurally the same move long used in Lagrangian modeling: encode costs in a potential-like term, then let the stationary-action condition pick the admissible path. ([physicsgg][1])

**Symmetry dictionary (Noether).** With (\mathcal{L}*p) in hand, the **currents** follow from continuous symmetries: invariance under rigid phase shifts of the locked cycle yields a conserved “coherence charge”; invariance under time translations yields a conserved **coherence-energy** (the on-cycle value of (K*\tau)); and invariance under re-phasings of coupled subcycles yields cluster-level integrals of motion. This is a direct application of Noether’s 1918 result: for each continuous symmetry of the action there exists a conserved quantity, proven in the language of variational calculus. The practical value is twofold: (1) it turns elusive “states of flow” into **testable invariants**; (2) it constrains allowable coupling forms used later when we embed standard relativistic/gauge symmetries as special cases. ([arXiv][3])

**Geometry by extremals.** Stationary-action paths are **geodesics** in a metric induced by the second variation of (\mathcal{S}_p). The curvature associated with that metric summarizes how **hard** it is to maintain coherence when (\Gamma) varies; high curvature regions force reconfiguration or failure. This is conceptually aligned with the familiar picture in which Minkowski geodesics describe inertial motion when spacetime is flat and deformations represent forces or curvature; the present construction generalizes that intuition to a coherence-first setting. ([Wikipedia][4])

In short, Section 2 gives a compact action, an operational cycle, and a symmetry dictionary. Subsequent sections use this dictionary to show how particular **isometries** of the cycle structure reproduce Lorentz kinematics and how **fibered** re-phasings of (Ki) anticipate Yang–Mills-type structure—without assuming them at the start.

**Claims**

* Dynamics follow a stationary **coherence action**; Noether currents arise from its continuous symmetries. ([physicsgg][1])
* (\tau_p) and (K_\tau) can be operationalized via standard **synchronization** order parameters and spectral concentration. ([Physical Review Link Manager][2])
* Coherence geodesics induce a curvature notion; high curvature predicts reconfiguration/failure under varying (\Gamma). ([Wikipedia][4])

# From Pressure to Curvature — (\nabla\Gamma) as Geometry

**Abstract**
We develop the correspondence between **gradients of temporal pressure** (\nabla\Gamma) and **effective curvature** experienced by coherence-geodesics defined by the coherence action (\int (K_\tau - V_\Gamma)dt). The map is motivated by three well-established formalisms: (i) spacetime curvature governing geodesics and sourced by stress–energy in general relativity, (ii) **optical metrics** where refractive-index structure bends rays as geodesics of an effective metric, and (iii) **analogue gravity** in fluids where perturbations propagate on emergent Lorentzian geometries. We treat (\Gamma) as a refractivity-like field for coherence transport and state tests that discriminate genuine geometric effects from mere potential forcing. ([DAMTP][1])

**Main Text**
In general relativity, free motion follows **geodesics** of a metric (g_{\mu\nu}); curvature is encoded in the Riemann tensor and, at the field-equation level, tied to stress–energy by the Einstein–Hilbert variational principle. The formal point for our purposes is procedural: geometry is inferred **operationally** from extremals of an action and from the deflection, focusing, and time-delay of probes. ([DAMTP][1])

Geometrical optics offers a closely analogous construction: in media with spatially varying **refractive index** (n(\mathbf{x})), rays extremize optical path length (Fermat’s principle) and can be rephrased as **geodesics of an effective optical metric** (Gordon metric). A gradient (\nabla n) bends rays without appealing to forces; equivalently, ray transport “feels” curvature induced by the medium. This is a robust and well-tested framework spanning gradient-index (GRIN) lenses and more sophisticated index-engineered media. ([Wikipedia][2])

A third precedent is **analogue gravity**, where perturbations in fluids (or BECs) propagate as if on a curved spacetime with an **acoustic metric**; horizons and lensing have faithful analogues in these systems. Again, the key lesson is methodological: appropriate background fields generate **effective metrics** for the transport of excitations. ([Physical Review Link Manager][3])

We now cast (\Gamma) into that family of “metric-inducing” backgrounds. Recall that the coherence action (\mathcal{S}*p=\int(K*\tau - V_\Gamma)dt) defines **coherence geodesics**—stationary trajectories for phase-locked transport. Write the second variation of (\mathcal{S}*p) along an extremal to define an **effective metric** (\tilde g) on the manifold of cycle states. The penalty (V*\Gamma) acts like an **index field** for coherence: its local slope and Hessian enter the Christoffel symbols of (\tilde g). Intuitively, spatial or temporal **gradients in (\Gamma)** deflect coherence geodesics; strong convexity in (V_\Gamma(\Gamma)) focuses or defocuses bundles, producing an **optical-mechanics** picture of coherence transport.

Three immediate consequences follow.

1. **Deflection law.** In regions with smooth (\nabla\Gamma), coherence paths exhibit a ray-bending term proportional to the transverse component of (\nabla\Gamma), analogous to GRIN optics; to leading order this yields a small-angle relation of the form (\Delta\theta \propto \int \partial_\perp \Gamma , ds) under fixed cycle speed, with higher-order corrections from curvature of the (\Gamma)-landscape. This is directly testable in engineered gradient media and synthetic network models. ([Optica Publishing Group][4])

2. **Focusing and caustics.** The **Jacobi equation** for neighboring coherence geodesics acquires a curvature term built from second derivatives of (\Gamma) (via the Hessian entering (\tilde g)). Beam convergence/divergence and **caustic** formation then play out in exact analogy to optical focusing and to geodesic deviation in GR. Operationally: measure bundle cross-section evolution to extract curvature invariants of (\tilde g). ([DAMTP][1])

3. **Horizon analogues.** Where the effective transport speed of coherence relative to background flow vanishes or reverses—e.g., when local detuning drives the group velocity to zero—the system admits **one-way membranes** for coherence, mimicking acoustic horizons. This is predicted wherever (\Gamma)-induced refractivity pushes the eikonal characteristics to a null surface of (\tilde g). Laboratory fluid analogues and waveguide arrays already exemplify the underlying mechanism. ([PMC][5])

Crucially, this is framed as a **correspondence**, not an identity: we do not claim the physical spacetime metric is (\tilde g); rather, (\tilde g) is the **transport geometry** relevant to coherence propagation under (\Gamma). The upshot is practical: wherever (\nabla\Gamma) can be measured or engineered, one can **predict** deflection, focusing, and horizon-like phenomena for coherence signals, and invert those observations to estimate the underlying (\Gamma)-structure—just as refractometry recovers (n(\mathbf{x})) and lensing maps mass in GR. The next section uses the same dictionary to connect cycle isometries to Lorentz kinematics and fibered rephasings of (Ki) to gauge-like structure.

**Claims**

* Gradients (\nabla\Gamma) induce an **effective metric** for coherence transport, analogous to optical and acoustic metrics. ([Neo-classical physics][6])
* Measurable **deflection/focusing** of coherence bundles follow from first/second derivatives of (\Gamma). ([Optica Publishing Group][4])
* Horizon-like one-way regions arise when (\Gamma)-induced refractivity drives characteristics to a null surface of (\tilde g). ([Physical Review Link Manager][3])

# Cycle Isometries → Lorentz; Fibered Rephasings → Yang–Mills

**Abstract**
We show how (i) **isometries of the intrinsic cycle** act as Lorentz-type symmetries on coherence geodesics and (ii) **fibered rephasings** of the resonant pattern induce Yang–Mills connections. The first recovers the kinematics of boosts/rotations from invariances of the cycle metric; the second follows the standard route that **gauging a global symmetry introduces a compensating gauge field**—geometrically, a connection on a principal bundle. We keep the construction operational and state tests that distinguish true symmetry from mere parametrization. (Background: Lorentz/Poincaré symmetry; Noether; gauge theory as fiber bundles; gauging a global symmetry.) ([Physics LibreTexts][1])

**Main Text**
**Lorentz from cycle isometries.** In relativistic kinematics, inertial motions are related by the **Lorentz group**, the subgroup of the Poincaré isometries preserving the Minkowski interval; boosts mix time with space while rotations mix spatial axes. A theory is Lorentz invariant when its dynamics is unchanged under these transformations. ([Wikipedia][2])

Our coherence dynamics supplies a different but compatible route: start with the **cycle metric** that measures phase-time along an intrinsic cycle (\tau_p). Demand that the coherence action be invariant under **isometries of this metric**. Two continuous families appear naturally: (a) re-scalings that preserve the cycle’s quadratic form but mix longitudinal (cycle) and transverse (embedding) directions—operationally analogous to **boosts**; and (b) rotations within transverse subspaces—analogous to spatial **rotations**. Because the action is extremized on geodesics, these isometries imply **Noether currents** that are conserved along optimal transport. The test is empirical: after appropriate normalization, measured trajectories should be related by the same two-parameter families that characterize Lorentz invariance (composition rules and rapidity addition law), not merely by arbitrary reparameterizations. ([Stanford University][3])

Intuitively, this echoes familiar **emergent Lorentz** scenarios: many-body systems can flow under coarse-graining to an effective invariant light-cone for excitations. Here, the “cone” is defined by the cycle metric’s null directions for coherence transport; emergence is then a statement about **fixed points** where anisotropies in the cycle metric become irrelevant. This perspective aligns with field-theory cases in which Lorentz invariance appears at low energies—even if it is broken microscopically. ([SpringerLink][4])

**Yang–Mills from fibered rephasings.** Now consider **rephasings** of the resonant pattern (Ki): a global transformation (Ki \mapsto U,Ki) (with (U) in some compact Lie group) leaves observables invariant. If this symmetry is promoted to be **local**—(U=U(x))—then derivatives of (Ki) cease to transform covariantly. The standard cure is to introduce a **gauge field** (A_\mu) that transforms to compensate the gradient of (U(x)). In geometric language, (A_\mu) is a **connection** on a principal fiber bundle; the associated curvature (F_{\mu\nu}) captures field strength. This is the modern, textbook statement of Yang–Mills theory. ([DAMTP][5])

The logic is structural, not ad hoc. Noether’s first theorem ties continuous **global** symmetries to conserved currents; **gauging** those symmetries introduces new dof whose transformation law guarantees local covariance. Physically, gauge fields are not optional decorations: they are the price of **local symmetry**. We emphasize the particularly useful formulation for experiments and modeling: treat (Ki) as a section of an associated vector bundle, (A_\mu) as the connection one-form, and use Wilson loops to detect nontrivial holonomy (global, non-perturbative effects invisible to purely local descriptions). ([Stanford University][3])

**Discriminating symmetry from parametrization.** Two pitfalls recur. *First*, an apparent invariance may be a coordinate artifact; the cure is to verify **group composition** and conserved Noether currents, not just invariance of a single equation. *Second*, local “gauge-like” knobs can be mere redefinitions unless there exists a **connection with nonzero curvature** detectable by holonomy or by covariant derivatives. These are standard diagnostics from bundle geometry and gauge theory. ([PhilSci Archive][6])

**Operational program.** (1) Fit the cycle metric from data; test whether inferred geodesics are closed under a two-parameter isometry group with the composition law of boosts and rotations. (2) Identify a global internal symmetry of the pattern space; localize it; recover a compensating field and confirm nontrivial curvature via loop variables or parallel transport of probes. A positive result in both tracks supports the claim that relativistic kinematics and gauge structure arise **as symmetries of coherence transport**, rather than as axioms imposed ab initio.

**Claims**

* Invariance under **cycle-metric isometries** yields Lorentz-type boosts and rotations with conserved Noether currents. ([Wikipedia][2])
* **Gauging** a global rephasing of the pattern field introduces a connection (A_\mu); curvature (F_{\mu\nu}) encodes physical field strength. ([DAMTP][5])
* Emergent Lorentz symmetry is expected at coarse-grained fixed points; deviations can be constrained experimentally. ([SpringerLink][4])

# Stiffness of the Pressure Field → Mass Scales and (\Lambda)

**Abstract**
We introduce a **stiffness parameter** for the temporal-pressure field (\Gamma) and argue that it sets two families of scales: (i) **effective masses** of excitations that propagate on the coherence transport geometry, and (ii) a **background vacuum contribution** that behaves as a cosmological constant (\Lambda) at large scales. The construction is a correspondence, not a replacement, for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs sector: we recover the usual mass generation in the appropriate limit, and use the stiffness map to predict scaling relations and cross-domain constraints. We state empirical tests against collider data (Higgs couplings) and cosmological data (Planck (\Lambda)CDM). ([Particle Data Group][1])

**Main Text**
In the SM, particle masses arise via **spontaneous symmetry breaking** in an (\mathrm{SU}(2)\times \mathrm{U}(1)) gauge theory: a scalar doublet develops a vacuum expectation value and gauge-invariant Yukawa couplings generate fermion masses; the Higgs mechanism gives mass to the (W^\pm) and (Z) bosons. Precision summaries emphasize that measured Higgs couplings are broadly consistent with SM expectations, subject to improving constraints. Any extension must therefore reduce to the SM mass map in a suitable limit. ([Particle Data Group][1])

Our proposal adds a **coherence-first layer**: excitations travel as **coherence geodesics** in an effective transport metric (\tilde g) (Sec. 3). Their dispersion receives a **mass-like gap** whenever the **curvature of the penalty** (V_\Gamma) is nonzero along the locked cycle—intuitively, a stiffer (\Gamma)-landscape resists phase transport and opens a gap. Let (\kappa_\Gamma\equiv \partial^2 V_\Gamma/\partial \Gamma^2) evaluated on-cycle; then, to leading order, the normal-mode spectrum acquires a term (\propto \sqrt{\kappa_\Gamma}). In the **Higgs limit**, (\kappa_\Gamma) is dominated by the curvature of the scalar potential at its minimum, reproducing SM masses; outside that limit, residual stiffness of the background pressure field contributes **subleading mass shifts** with definite scaling. This preserves SM successes while providing a clean target for deviations in heavy sectors and composite channels. ([Particle Data Group][1])

The same stiffness has a second face at **cosmological scales**. A **homogeneous offset** of (V_\Gamma) acts as a background **vacuum pressure**; when coarse-grained, it contributes an effective cosmological constant (\Lambda_{\rm eff}). This is not an attempt to solve the **cosmological constant problem**—the staggering mismatch between naive vacuum-energy estimates and the observed value—but to articulate **how** a time-substrate theory should account for the observed small, positive acceleration while remaining compatible with precision CMB constraints. Operationally, we require that the renormalized background of (V_\Gamma) approaches a constant on large scales, with magnitude consistent with (\Lambda) inferred from CMB, BAO, and SNe analyses (Planck legacy constraints within base (\Lambda)CDM). The classic literature frames the tuning problem; our role here is to expose its **measurement hooks** in a coherence-first setting. ([Physical Review Links][2])

**What makes this falsifiable?** First, **collider-facing tests**: because (\kappa_\Gamma) perturbs dispersion as a universal stiffness, mass **ratios** across related channels acquire correlated shifts that cannot be mimicked by independent Yukawa tweaks. Global fits to Higgs signal strengths and differential distributions can bound (or reveal) such correlated departures, especially in heavy-flavor and vector-boson channels where uncertainties are still shrinking. Second, **astrophysical/cosmological tests**: if (\Lambda_{\rm eff}) is the large-scale face of the same stiffness, then the allowed room for (\kappa_\Gamma) at collider scales is cross-constrained by the precision value of (\Lambda) (and vice versa). Third, **transport-geometry tests**: in engineered media and network analogues, increasing environmental stiffness should open **predictable spectral gaps** and alter group velocities exactly as the (\sqrt{\kappa_\Gamma}) rule demands, independently verifying the mechanism in classical systems.

To keep distinct what is asserted: (A) **In the SM limit**, our map reduces to the Higgs mechanism and inherits its successes. (B) **Beyond the limit**, residual (\Gamma)-stiffness shifts effective masses in a correlated way; the shifts scale with curvature of the penalty landscape and with detuning structure of the locked cycle. (C) **At large scales**, the background of (V_\Gamma) contributes to (\Lambda_{\rm eff}); consistency demands that this contribution be small and stable under coarse-graining, in line with Planck-era cosmology. The virtue of the correspondence is practical: it trades metaphysical debate for **joint fits** across collider and cosmological observables.

**Claims**

* A **homogeneous offset** of the pressure potential contributes (\Lambda_{\rm eff}); its magnitude must match Planck-era constraints. ([A&A Journal][3])

# Electron and Muon (g!-!2) — Calibration and Stress Tests

**Abstract**
We use the electron and muon magnetic anomalies as **calibration** and **stress tests** of any time-substrate extension. For the electron, the anomaly (a_e) now yields a determination of (\alpha) or, given (\alpha), an exquisitely sharp Standard Model (SM) prediction; current comparisons are limited by tensions among **independent (\alpha) measurements** (Cs and Rb atom-interferometry) and by residual theory uncertainties. For the muon, Fermilab’s **final world-leading measurement (2025)** provides a durable benchmark while the SM **theory initiative** continues to update hadronic inputs. We state what the coherence-pressure hypothesis must match and how to **falsify** it with joint fits. ([Physical Review Links][1])

**Main Text**
**Electron: the metrological yardstick.** The electron anomaly (a_e) is both a triumph of QED and a metrology engine: with tenth-order QED computed and tiny electroweak/hadronic corrections, one may (i) predict (a_e) given (\alpha), or (ii) infer (\alpha) given (a_e). The 2023 Penning-trap measurement improved the experimental precision to the 0.13-ppt level, sharpening this two-way bridge. The resulting test is presently limited not by trap data but by **discrepant high-precision (\alpha)** determinations from atom-interferometry (Cs vs Rb), which shift the SM prediction within a few standard deviations and complicate claims of beyond-SM effects inferred from (a_e) alone. Any extension must therefore **track both branches**: reproduce (a_e) for either (\alpha) choice and remain consistent with the trap value within its minuscule error budget. Practically, we treat (a_e) as a **calibrator**: a successful model must reduce to SM-QED at the electron’s kinematic scale and respect the current (\alpha) landscape. ([Physical Review Links][1])

**Muon: the precision stress test.** The muon’s heavier mass amplifies sensitivity to short-distance structure and to any new coupling. Fermilab’s 2025 **final experimental result** cements the world average with unprecedented precision and will stand for years as the reference point for theory and model building. On the theory side, the **Muon (g-2) Theory Initiative** continues to refine the SM prediction, especially the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and light-by-light (HLbL) contributions, with ongoing dialogue between data-driven dispersive methods and lattice computations. The upshot is a **moving target**: while the experimental pillar is now firm, the **SM prediction** is still under active consolidation. Any proposed beyond-SM term (including a (\Gamma)-coupling as in our framework) must be **modular**—able to be overlaid on updated SM baselines without retrofitting—and must respect correlated constraints from electroweak precision fits. ([News][2])

**What the time-substrate adds.** In our correspondence, **temporal-pressure gradients** (\nabla \Gamma) perturb **phase transport** of charged leptons. For the electron, the effect is suppressed by the relative softness of the local (\Gamma) landscape on its cycle; for heavier leptons the “wound-channel” in phase-space deepens, scaling the correction with a mass-sensitive factor. Phenomenologically, we parameterize this as a small, sign-definite addition (\Delta a_\ell(\Gamma)) with **hierarchical scaling** (|\Delta a_e|\ll|\Delta a_\mu|), and (as a forecast for Sec. 7) (|\Delta a_\tau| \gtrsim |\Delta a_\mu|) subject to experimental reach. The key is not the existence of a shift but its **cross-channel correlation** and kinematic dependence: a single stiffness/detuning structure must explain (or be bounded by) *both* (a_e) and (a_\mu) simultaneously.

Awesome—here’s the draft for the new main-text section. It’s deliberately light on equations, names the spatialization map (\Sigma), and explains (i) what (\Sigma) does, (ii) why (3{+}1) dimensions are the natural large-scale endpoint, and (iii) why Lorentz symmetry emerges as the low-energy envelope. I’ve included external citations that a referee can chase without diving into our appendices.

# The Spatialization Map: From Time to Spacetime

**What problem this solves.** Up to now we have a **temporal substrate**: dynamics of cycles and coherence constrained by a pressure field (\Gamma) and an action (S_{\text{time}}). Our claims about emergent spacetime and low-energy physics require a bridge from this pre-geometric description to an **effective Lorentzian manifold** with stable causal cones and quasi-local interactions. We call that bridge the **spatialization map** (\Sigma).

## What (\Sigma) is (in one line)

[
\boxed{\ \Sigma:\ \text{temporal transport data}\ \longrightarrow\ \big(\mathcal{M},,g_{\mu\nu},,\text{fields},,\mathcal{U}\big)\ }
]

It takes **cycle-resolved temporal transport**—lock structure, second-variation metric, and entanglement pattern—and produces (i) a **coarse-grained manifold** (\mathcal{M}) with metric (g_{\mu\nu}), (ii) **matter/gauge content** as fiber data over (\mathcal{M}), and (iii) a **universal infrared (IR) symmetry** (\mathcal{U}) that is approximately Lorentzian. Conceptually, (\Sigma) is **neither a mere projection nor a gauge choice**: it is a **functorial coarse-graining** composed of three steps—causal skeleton, metricization, and entanglement weaving. (Similar “state (\to) geometry” correspondences are well known in holography and entanglement-based reconstructions. ([arXiv][1]))

## Step 1: Causal skeleton from finite-speed influence

Temporal substrates with local generators obey **finite-speed influence bounds**: disturbances spread inside an approximate light cone even without relativity put in by hand. In lattice language these are **Lieb–Robinson (LR) cones**; in continuous limits they appear as effective causal cones for correlation and information transport. We take the union of these cones, integrated over locks and control parameters, as the **causal skeleton** on which (\Sigma) will graft spatial slices. (LR bounds formalize this emergent cone. ([Physical Review Links][2]))

**Operationally:** if two regions never exchange coherence within the LR cone tolerance, they are “far” in the spatialization sense. That is, **distance** starts life as a **time-to-influence** functional on the substrate graph.

## Step 2: Metricization from transport curvature

Around stable locks, the **second variation** of the coherence action defines an effective **transport metric** (\tilde g) for optimal trajectories; its curvature controls focusing/defocusing and caustics. Spatial coordinates are then introduced as **isochronal sections** that minimize cross-coupling in (\tilde g), yielding a family of slices whose induced distances approximate geodesic distances for transport. This is the “metricization” piece of (\Sigma) that turns causal ordering into **metric structure**. (See also standard Jacobi/second-variation geometry; we use it purely as a construction device here.)

**Intuition:** the substrate tells us *how* coherence prefers to flow (geodesics of (\tilde g)); spatial slices are those across which flow is locally orthogonal on average.

## Step 3: Entanglement weaving → bulk locality

Finally, we promote quasi-local transport into bona-fide **bulk locality** using the **pattern of entanglement** across the substrate degrees of freedom. Heuristically: **where entanglement is strong across a cut, the bulk wants to “pinch in”; where it is weak, it “necks out.”** In holographic language this reproduces the rule of thumb that **geometry is coded in entanglement**, and in tensor-network language (MERA and its cousins) that a **multi-scale entanglement structure** builds an extra “radial” direction whose geodesics track minimal cuts. (\Sigma) uses this weave to decide which connections are promoted to **neighbor relations** in (\mathcal{M}). (Foundational treatments: Ryu–Takayanagi; Van Raamsdonk’s “entanglement builds spacetime”; MERA-as-geometry. ([arXiv][1]))

**Summary so far:** causal cones (Step 1) + transport metric (Step 2) + entanglement weave (Step 3) = a **coarse-grained Lorentzian arena** in which the low-energy fields live.

---

## Why (3{+}1) dimensions at large scales?

The spatialization map does **not** hard-code the number of dimensions; it **infers** it from transport + entanglement structure under coarse-graining. Two robust pointers favor (3{+}1) in the IR:

1. **Dimensional flow toward 4 at large scales.** In nonperturbative approaches where one sums over microscopic geometries subject to causal constraints, the **spectral dimension** measured by diffusion processes **flows to 4** in the infrared while **reducing at short scales**. This suggests that a wide class of micro-dynamics (including ones without explicit spatial inputs) coarse-grains to an **effective 4D background**. (\Sigma) is compatible with this: at long coherence lengths the inferred dimension stabilizes at ~4, while at short lengths it can run. (Causal Dynamical Triangulations: spectral-dimension (4\to 2) running and recent reviews. ([Physical Review Links][3]))

2. **Information-theoretic locality with finite cones.** LR-type cones plus entanglement-area-like scaling favor **low-dimensional, locally connected** coarse spaces. Empirically, many quantum critical systems with local interactions flow toward **relativistic fixed points** with linear dispersion and isotropic cones—precisely the kinematics that, when spatialized, read as (3{+}1) Lorentz covariance (next subsection). (Emergent Lorentz symmetry under RG. ([arXiv][4]))

We therefore treat “(3{+}1) at large scales” as a **result** of (\Sigma) under broad conditions, not an assumption.

---

## Why Lorentz symmetry emerges in the IR

Two mechanisms make Lorentz symmetry **generic** once (\Sigma) has built a quasi-local manifold:

* **Cone matching:** If the substrate supports a **single finite influence speed** (the LR velocity) and the entanglement weave suppresses super-cone couplings, linearizing transport around a homogeneous state yields **linear dispersion** with an **isotropic cone**—the kinematic hallmark of Lorentz invariance. (Effective light-cones from LR; linear-cone stability. ([Physical Review Links][2]))

* **RG attraction:** Anisotropic micro-theories often **flow to relativistic fixed points** under coarse-graining, with deviations suppressed by irrelevant operators. This is well documented in strongly coupled flows and holographic models where non-Lorentz UVs run to Lorentzian IRs. (\Sigma) just needs to preserve the coarse-grained cone and metric; the RG then **locks** the symmetry. (Emergent Lorentz via strong dynamics/holography. ([arXiv][4]))

**Expectation:** Lorentz symmetry is an **approximate IR symmetry** with controlled, energy-dependent violations. That is exactly what our transport-curvature diagnostics in the appendices are designed to quantify.

---

## What (\Sigma) *is not*

* **Not holography by fiat.** We borrow holographic *intuition* (entanglement ↔ geometry) but do not assume AdS or a boundary CFT. The weave is empirical: built from substrate entanglement and transport, not imposed. (Background for readers who want the standard story. ([arXiv][1]))

* **Not a coordinate gauge.** Changing substrate labels leaves (\Sigma) invariant by construction; only **causal reach, transport curvature, and entanglement cuts** matter.

* **Not unique.** Different coarse-graining schemes can yield equivalent IR geometries (same cones and curvatures within error). That is good: it encodes **universality**.

---

## Minimal falsifiers for this section

The spatialization map stands or falls with three empirical properties (each testable with the toolchain we already specified):

1. **Cones:** a finite, state-independent influence cone fails to materialize in substrate dynamics (no LR-type envelope) → (\Sigma)’s causal skeleton collapses. ([Physical Review Links][2])
2. **Metricization:** transport curvature inferred from second variations refuses to define a stable geodesic bundle (no reproducible focusing/defocusing) → no (g_{\mu\nu}) in the IR.
3. **Weave:** entanglement cuts do not correlate with the inferred distances (no “minimal-cut ≈ geodesic” alignment) → the locality step fails. (Contrast with established entanglement/geometry correspondences. ([arXiv][1]))

If any one of these consistently fails under preregistered analyses, the jump from time substrate to spacetime is **not** justified by our machinery.

---

**Where the heavy math lives.** Full derivations—LR-cone reconstruction, second-variation metricization, and a constructive “entanglement-to-distance” functional—are placed in a dedicated appendix (suggested “App. B-prime: Spatialization Map (\Sigma)”). Readers can verify that the main-text story here follows from those definitions and the cited literature.

**Falsification protocol (joint fits).**

1. **Calibrate on (a_e):** choose (\alpha) (Cs or Rb) and fit residuals in (a_e). Any nonzero (\Delta a_e) must be **below** the trap+theory envelope for that (\alpha). ([Physical Review Links][1])
2. **Stress on (a_\mu):** propagate the *same* parameters to (a_\mu) and compare with the **final Fermilab** value using the latest SM baseline (with quoted HVP/HLbL uncertainties). Overfitting (a_\mu) at the cost of violating (a_e) is disallowed. ([News][2])
3. **Robustness to SM updates:** refit when the **Theory White Paper (2025)** and subsequent updates revise hadronic inputs. A genuine (\Gamma)-coupling should remain stable across these baseline shifts, within uncertainties. ([Indico][3])

**Why this matters methodologically.** The electron anchors **continuity with QED/metrology**; the muon probes **stress at heavier scales**. Treating them together prevents “moving-goalpost” artifacts and aligns with best practice: state the measurement (trap or storage ring), state the SM baseline with its provenance, and state the incremental hypothesis in a **one-parameter-family** that is easy to exclude. If the single-parameter map cannot jointly satisfy both anomalies as data and SM theory consolidate, the correspondence is **ruled out** for leptons.

**Claims**

* (a_e) is a **calibrator**: any extension must match the 0.13-ppt trap value given independent (\alpha) determinations. ([Physical Review Links][1])
* Fermilab’s **final** (a_\mu) is the long-term **stress test**; fits must survive SM theory updates (HVP/HLbL). ([News][2])
* A single (\Gamma)-coupling that cannot jointly fit (a_e) and (a_\mu) is **falsified** in the lepton sector. ([Indico][3])

# Tau (g!-!2) Forecast and “Pressuron” Signatures

**Abstract**
The tau’s anomalous magnetic moment (a_\tau) remains poorly constrained due to its short lifetime, but recent proposals (ultra-peripheral heavy-ion (\gamma\gamma\to\tau^+\tau^-), polarized (e^+e^-), and high-luminosity B-factories) promise order-of-magnitude improvements. We frame a **single-parameter forecast** consistent with the electron/muon analysis (Sec. 6) and outline **pressuron** signatures—phenomenology of a dilaton-like scalar that decouples in pressureless regimes but can re-couple where “temporal pressure” is high. We list concrete tests at Belle II/LHC heavy-ion runs and cosmology, and emphasize falsifiability via **cross-channel correlations**. (Background: current (a_\tau) limits, Belle II prospects, (\gamma\gamma) UPC strategies, pressuron basics and cosmological bounds.) ([CERN Document Server][1])

**Main Text**
**Status.** Unlike (a_e) and (a_\mu), (a_\tau) is still limited at the percent level, with the most widely quoted LEP constraint from DELPHI, (-0.052 < a_\tau < 0.013) (95% CL), now joined by LHC analyses exploiting (\gamma\gamma\to\tau^+\tau^-). CMS and ATLAS feasibility/early results indicate competitive bounds and a clear path to improvement as statistics and systematics mature. Belle II’s growing dataset, together with polarized-beam concepts, targets further sensitivity gains. The upshot: **a rapidly improving frontier** ripe for theory-driven, correlational tests. ([CERN Document Server][1])

**Forecast architecture (one parameter carried from Sec. 6).** We parameterize the coherence-pressure correction as (\Delta a_\ell(\Gamma)=\eta,\Xi_\ell), where (\eta) is a **single stiffness/detuning parameter** (common across leptons) and (\Xi_\ell) encodes lepton-specific cycle/structure factors. Section 6 established (|\Delta a_e|\ll|\Delta a_\mu|). For the tau we expect (|\Xi_\tau|\gtrsim|\Xi_\mu|) (heavier mass, deeper wound-channel), so the **same (\eta)** fit on ((a_e,a_\mu)) yields a **sharp, sign-definite** prediction band for (a_\tau). This makes the tau sector a **pre-registered test**: an improved measurement that lands outside the propagated band kills the single-parameter map; agreement strengthens cross-domain universality. (For experimental context and methodologies, see tau-dipole reviews and recent proceedings.) ([arXiv][2])

**Experimental avenues.**

1. **Ultra-peripheral Pb–Pb (\gamma\gamma) collisions (LHC).** Tagging ( \gamma\gamma\to\tau^+\tau^- ) with semileptonic decays accesses (a_\tau) through differential distributions; studies show feasibility with existing and future datasets, with realistic prospects for tightening the LEP-era interval. ([Physical Review Links][3])
2. **Belle II.** High-statistic tau samples, refined tagging, and (in some proposals) **polarized (e^-)** beams enhance sensitivity to anomalous moments in (e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-) and radiative channels. Systematic control (radiative corrections, spin-correlation modeling) is the limiter but steadily improving. ([arXiv][4])
3. **Future lepton or muon colliders.** Studies indicate order-of-magnitude gains beyond current constraints if clean (\tau)-pair thresholds and polarization are available. ([INSPIRE][5])

**Pressuron signatures (correspondence view).** A “pressuron” is a scalar whose coupling effectively **decouples in pressureless fluids** but re-emerges when pressure (or analogous stress) is present. In scalar-tensor language, this yields GR-like behavior in dust limits yet allows departures in high-pressure or high-frequency environments. Cosmology constrains such scalars via CMB/BAO fits and bounds on time-variation of (G); late-time analyses show tight limits on background couplings. In our coherence-first reading, **regions of high (\Gamma)** (temporal pressure) mimic the “pressureful” regime: look for (i) **frequency-dependent** phase-transport shifts (e.g., in (g!-!2) scaling to (\tau)), and (ii) small, correlated departures in systems with large stress/curvature. Any claimed pressuron effect must **survive** cosmological bounds and local tests. ([arXiv][6])

**Falsifiability program (tau-anchored).**

* **Pre-registered band:** Fix (\eta) on ((a_e,a_\mu)); publish the resulting (a_\tau) interval. If improved Belle II/LHC measurements fall outside, the one-parameter law is rejected. ([arXiv][2])
* **Channel-correlated systematics:** Cross-check that the sign and **mass-scaled magnitude** of (\Delta a_\tau) are consistent with UPC and (e^+e^-) determinations. Disagreement implies either modeling failure or non-universal new physics. ([SciPost][7])
* **Cosmology cross-constraint:** Any pressuron-like coupling used to explain (a_\tau) must obey CMB-era scalar-tensor bounds (variation of (G), background equation-of-state fits). Failure to thread both needles **falsifies** the correspondence. ([arXiv][8])

**Claims**

* A **single-parameter** (\Delta a_\ell(\Gamma)) fit to ((a_e,a_\mu)) yields a **sign-definite** (a_\tau) band; out-of-band results falsify the map. ([arXiv][2])
* **UPC (\gamma\gamma)** and **Belle II** measurements can improve the legacy LEP interval and test mass-scaled correlation. ([SciPost][7])
* Any pressuron-motivated coupling must **survive cosmological scalar-tensor bounds** on background variation and late-time dynamics. ([Physical Review Links][9])

# Phenomenology of the Γ-Field

**Why this belongs here.** Having argued that coarse-grained spacetime and low-energy symmetries emerge from the temporal substrate, we now ask what the **pressure/coupling field (\Gamma)** *does* across scales. The answer should be readable straight from data: from quantum gaps and laboratory “stiffening,” to the galaxy scaling laws that motivate MOND-like behavior, to cluster and cosmic tests that any such field must face.

## A unifying picture in three regimes

### 1) Microscopic: stiffness → gaps (no long-range force needed)

At short coherence lengths (\Gamma) acts like a **stiffness** that raises spectral gaps of transport modes (our Appendices make this algebraic). Phenomenologically this resembles how a confining background or order-parameter curvature generates **effective masses**—a local effect that does *not* require extra long-range forces.

**Observable motif:** gap opening and correlated mass shifts in controlled systems (colliders or analogues). This is orthogonal to galaxy phenomenology and can be tested without cosmology.

### 2) Mesoscopic & Solar-System: screened / pressure-coupled behavior

To survive stringent fifth-force tests, (\Gamma) must be quiet where ordinary matter is effectively **pressureless**. Scalar–tensor constructions that **decouple in dust-like regimes** (sometimes called “pressuron” models) are explicit examples: the scalar couples to pressure, so it **switches off** in low-pressure environments, recovering GR locally while remaining active where pressure or inhomogeneity matter. This is one route—compatible with our narrative—for (\Gamma) to be cosmologically or galactically relevant yet **Solar-System safe**. ([arXiv][1])

### 3) Galactic to cosmic: a low-acceleration envelope

On galaxy scales, several **regularities** point to a universal low-acceleration behavior:

* **MOND acceleration scale** (a_0 \sim 10^{-10},\mathrm{m,s^{-2}}), empirically close to (cH_0) up to order-unity factors, marks where dynamics deviate from naive Newtonian expectations. ([Annual Reviews][2])
* The **Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR)** ties total centripetal acceleration to that predicted by baryons with remarkably small scatter across 100+ discs. Any field that modifies dynamics must **track baryons** tightly to live on this relation. ([Physical Review Links][3])
* The same dataset (SPARC) standardizes this testbed and continues to be updated. ([ADS][4])

In our language, (\Gamma) can act as a **long-range, low-acceleration response**: when transport curvature falls below a threshold set by the ambient Hubble scale, (\Gamma) contributes an extra “pull” that effectively raises the centripetal acceleration in thin discs while remaining negligible at high accelerations. Conceptually, this slots beside other IR-response ideas (e.g., **emergent-gravity** elastic responses that inject an (a_0!\sim!cH_0) scale). We do not adopt those models, but they illustrate how a background scale can feed a galaxy-scale force law. ([SciPost][5])

## How one field spans “confinement” to “MOND-like”

The common thread is **state-dependent coupling**:

* **High-curvature / high-pressure** environments: (\Gamma) mainly renormalizes local inertia (mass gaps), with strong screening of any fifth force. (Pressuron-like decoupling is one explicit mechanism.) ([arXiv][1])
* **Low-acceleration, extended discs:** the same field’s **unscreened IR response** can add an acceleration term that scales with the baryonic potential, aligning naturally with RAR and the baryonic Tully–Fisher slope. ([Physical Review Links][3])

This two-regime behavior—screened locally, effective in the IR—is not exotic: it mirrors known **screening mechanisms** in scalar–tensor and modified-gravity phenomenology, just specialized to a pressure/curvature trigger.

## Hard constraints this picture must pass

1. **Galaxy scaling laws (must match, not merely fit).**
   Reproduce the **RAR** and related disc relations with *fixed* parameters across the SPARC set; no per-galaxy retuning. That is, (\Gamma) must be **baryon-linked and universal** to within the observed scatter. ([Physical Review Links][3])

2. **Clusters and strong lensing (where many MOND-likes struggle).**
   The **Bullet Cluster** shows lensing mass separated from baryonic plasma after a supersonic merger; any (\Gamma)-based modification must either (i) **co-move** with a collisionless component that lenses like dark matter, or (ii) reproduce the observed lensing map via its own field stresses. Otherwise the phenomenology fails at cluster scales. ([arXiv][6])

3. **Cosmic background & growth.**
   If (\Gamma) substitutes part of “dark sector” behavior, it has to accommodate **CMB anisotropies** and late-time growth without wrecking the well-measured background. (We keep this in the cosmology appendix and use standard pipelines to test small IR departures.)

## What this section commits to (and what it doesn’t)

* **Commits:** (\Gamma) has a **switchable coupling** that suppresses local fifth forces (pressure/screening) yet **activates** in low-acceleration, extended configurations to yield a MOND-like envelope **tied to baryons**. That alone predicts tight relations like RAR with minimal freedom. ([Physical Review Links][3])
* **Doesn’t commit:** we do **not** assume a particular micro-Lagrangian (chameleon, symmetron, superfluid, emergent-gravity, etc.). Those are comparison classes—we use them to define **tests** and **failure modes**, not to anchor the theory. ([SciPost][5])

## Minimal falsifiers (data-first)

* **RAR miss:** If, under a single global parameter set, the (\Gamma)-induced law **fails** to predict the RAR slope/zero-point/scatter on SPARC, the galactic piece is wrong. ([Physical Review Links][3])
* **Cluster lensing mismatch:** If lensing mass–light offsets in **merging clusters** cannot be reproduced by any reasonable (\Gamma) stress–energy or co-moving proxy, discard the “dark-sector unification” claim. ([arXiv][6])
* **Solar-System leakage:** Any detectable fifth force in **low-pressure** environments at current precision (where decoupling predicts silence) rules out the screening picture. ([arXiv][1])

---

**What readers should take away:** the (\Gamma)-field is not a hand-wavy “fifth force.” It is a **state-dependent coupling** that (i) hardens spectra locally (laboratory/particle scales), (ii) stays silent where pressure is negligible (Solar-System), and (iii) **activates** as a controlled IR response that reproduces the **baryon-linked regularities** of galaxy rotation without ad-hoc tuning—*and* then faces strong, named tests at cluster and cosmological scales.

# Cosmology as a Transport Probe — Background, Linear Growth, and Lensing

**Abstract**
We treat large-scale structure as a **transport experiment** for the coherence law: background expansion fixes the stage, while **linear growth** and **lensing** diagnose how temporal-pressure gradients (\nabla\Gamma) act on perturbations. We keep the background consistent with **Planck 2018** (\Lambda)CDM parameters and use the growth sector for discrimination: (i) a mild, scale-dependent suppression at late times, (ii) a lensing “slip” interpretable as refractivity in the transport metric, and (iii) halo-core systematics captured by a quasi-constant central surface density. We place these against weak-lensing surveys (DES Y3, KiDS) and cluster constraints (Bullet Cluster–type mergers), emphasizing falsifiability through **joint fits**. ([ADS][1])

**Main Text**
**Background.** The final Planck analyses provide a precise baseline for the expansion history in (\Lambda)CDM (e.g., (\Omega_m), (H_0), (A_s), (n_s)), against which any modified growth must be evaluated. We **do not alter** the well-constrained background in this section; instead, we express departures through the **transport of coherence**: how (\nabla\Gamma) alters the propagation of perturbations that ordinarily grow under gravity alone. This mirrors standard practice where one keeps background parameters fixed and studies growth-level modifications. ([ADS][1])

**Linear growth and the (S_8) landscape.** Weak-lensing/cosmic-shear surveys historically reported a slightly **lower** clustering amplitude than Planck’s inference, summarized in (S_8\equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}). While the **significance has evolved** with improved analyses, the basic diagnostic remains: does late-time structure prefer suppressed power? DES Y3 released a coherent multi-paper suite; KiDS-1000 provided a high-precision shear-only determination; and very recent **KiDS-Legacy** cross-checks report substantially **reduced tension** when systematics are harmonized. Our correspondence offers a concrete mechanism: a small, redshift-dependent **refractive drag** from (\Gamma) on coherence transport that **suppresses** low-redshift power without changing the CMB-era background—structurally similar to “dark drag” models studied as one-parameter extensions. This yields a testable template for combined CMB+shear fits. ([darkenergysurvey.org][2])

**Lensing as refractometry.** In geometric optics, gradients in refractive index bend rays; by analogy, (\nabla\Gamma) in the coherence transport metric induces a **lensing slip** between Newtonian-gauge potentials. Operationally, we predict a small, scale- and redshift-dependent adjustment in the convergence power spectrum relative to GR with cold dark matter only. DES Y3’s **convergence maps** and similar reconstructions provide direct targets: fit for a single refractivity parameter that vanishes in GR. A nonzero best-fit that is **stable across tomographic bins** supports the correspondence; instability or inconsistent signs falsifies it. ([ADS][3])

**Halo cores and merger offsets.** On galactic scales, several datasets suggest a **quasi-constant central surface density** (\mu_{0D}\approx \rho_0 r_0) across diverse systems—a regularity that any microphysics must explain or avoid. In merging clusters (e.g., the **Bullet Cluster**), gravitational lensing separates collisionless mass from collisional gas, yielding constraints on dark-sector interactions and on any effective **transport geometry** that could mimic offsets. Our mapping anticipates **no additional long-range force**, only refractivity in transport; thus it must **respect** Bullet-Cluster-scale constraints and the mixed evidence for claimed galaxy-scale offsets (e.g., Abell 3827). Joint fits that require large effective drags at cluster scales would violate these bounds. ([arXiv][4])

**Methodology for falsification.**

1. **CMB+Shear Joint Fit:** Fix Planck background; add one **refractive-drag** parameter governing late-time growth. Demand that it simultaneously (a) respect Planck, (b) fit DES/KiDS shear, and (c) predict stable tomographic posteriors. Failure on any leg rejects the correspondence in the linear regime. ([ADS][1])
2. **Convergence-map test:** Using DES-Y3 mass maps, fit for a lensing-slip amplitude with a simple redshift scaling. A null result consistent with GR is acceptable; a **sign-flipping** or scale-incoherent detection falsifies the proposed mapping rather than supporting it. ([ADS][3])
3. **Core–Cluster Consistency:** Constrain any small-scale refractivity via the observed (\mu_{0D}) regularity and **merger constraints**. If the parameter values needed to fit (S_8) imply cluster-scale transport that contradicts Bullet-Cluster bounds, the model is ruled out. ([arXiv][4])

**Claims**

* A **one-parameter refractive drag** can be confronted with CMB+shear data; stable, tomographically consistent fits support the correspondence. ([darkenergysurvey.org][2])
* Lensing **slip** provides an independent test via convergence-map reconstructions; incoherent or sign-flipping signals falsify the mapping. ([ADS][3])
* Any transport-based explanation must **respect** halo-core regularities and cluster-merger constraints (Bullet Cluster). ([arXiv][4])

singing, Keaton. here’s the new main-text section—position it between **Cosmological Implications** and your current “Principle of Correspondence” header. it’s written as a **user guide** for mapping ({K_\tau,\Gamma,\tilde g,\ldots}) into any complex domain, with one worked ecology example. external citations only.

---

# The Principle of Correspondence: A Bridge to Complexity

**What this section does.** It operationalizes how to carry the substrate variables—cycle “kinetic” (K_\tau), pressure/coupling (\Gamma), transport metric (\tilde g), lock period (\tau_p), stiffness (\kappa_\Gamma)—into empirical observables in a new domain (biology, cognition, social systems). The procedure is deliberately conservative: it starts with **dimensional reduction**, fixes a **causal scaffold**, and then asks for **invariants** that can be preregistered and falsified.

## A three-step “user guide” for new domains

### Step 1 — Make the quantities commensurate (nondimensionalize)

Before analogizing anything, compress units: form a **dimensionless basis** ({\pi_i}) from the raw observables and the substrate variables using Buckingham’s (\pi)-theorem. Then propose your correspondence as relations among (\pi)’s, not among dimensional quantities. This removes unit arbitrariness and exposes true control parameters. ([Wikipedia][1])

**Example pattern:**

* (\pi_{\text{drive}}=\tfrac{K_\tau}{K_0}), (\pi_{\text{load}}=\tfrac{\Gamma}{\Gamma_0}), (\pi_{\text{curv}}=L^2\mathcal{K}) (dimensionless sectional curvature from (\tilde g) over a scale (L)), (\pi_{\text{tempo}} = T/\tau_p).
* Empirical side: (\pi_{\text{rate}}=\lambda/\lambda_0) (growth or throughput), (\pi_{\text{noise}}=\sigma/\sigma_0), etc.

### Step 2 — Commit to a causal scaffold (then test it)

Adopt a minimal **structural causal model** (SCM): draw a DAG whose nodes are ({\pi_{\text{drive}},\pi_{\text{load}},\pi_{\text{curv}},\ldots}) and target observables, and write down the interventions you could in principle perform (do-calculus mindset). This clarifies which correspondences are **predictive** versus merely correlative—for instance, (\Gamma) as a manipulable load vs. a hidden confound. ([Amazon][2])

**Heuristic:** place (K_\tau) at the **computational** level (what the system is trying to preserve—coherent throughput), (\tilde g) at the **algorithmic/representational** level (how transport is organized), and the specific mechanisms (channels, synapses, species interactions) at the **implementational** level. That division keeps you from overfitting mechanism to invariant. ([Colin Phillips][3])

### Step 3 — Identify and preregister invariants

Look for **one scalar invariant** and **one conservation/current** you can measure. Typical pairs:

* **Invariant:** a peak/lock criterion (e.g., a triad ridge or a thresholded phase-bundle) mapping to (Q_{\rm cyc}) or to a curvature sign in (\tilde g).
* **Current:** a Noether-like quantity (e.g., constant flow of a resource, constant mutual information rate) that remains flat on-cycle and breaks at transition.

Then **predeclare** kill-criteria: what pattern would contradict the mapping (wrong sign, missing conservation, failure to replicate under intervention).

---

## A worked example: ecological viability as (K_\tau), selection pressure as (\Gamma)

**Goal.** Map substrate variables to a population with trait (z) under selection and demography. Let (\lambda(z,t)) be per-capita growth (fitness proxy), (N(t)) population size, and (E(t)) an environment/control knob.

### 1) Nondimensionalize

Choose scales (\lambda_0) (baseline growth), (E_0) (baseline environment), (T) (observation time). Define
[
\pi_{\text{rate}}=\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0},\quad
\pi_{\text{drive}}=\frac{K_\tau}{K_0},\quad
\pi_{\text{load}}=\frac{\Gamma}{\Gamma_0},\quad
\pi_{\text{tempo}}=\frac{T}{\tau_p}.
]
Interpretation: (\pi_{\text{drive}}) measures **on-cycle coherence of reproduction/survival**; (\pi_{\text{load}}) is **selection pressure** (resource scarcity, predation, climate stress) compressing exploratory dynamics.

### 2) Causal scaffold

Adopt a two-level SCM:

* **Trait dynamics (fast):** (z_{t+1}=z_t + \eta\ \mathrm{sign}\big(\partial \pi_{\text{rate}}/\partial z\big) + \xi_t) (small innovation (\eta); noise (\xi_t)).
* **Population (slow):** (N_{t+1}=N_t\exp{\lambda(z_t,E_t)-\Gamma(E_t)}).

Interventions: do(E!\uparrow) (heat or resource shock), do(\Gamma!\uparrow) (add controlled “load,” e.g., predation proxy), do(z) (artificial selection). The **Price equation** provides the bookkeeping: (\Delta\bar z = \operatorname{Cov}(w,z)/\bar w + \mathbb{E}(w,\Delta z)/\bar w). Here, (\Gamma) depresses (w) (fitness) and thus pushes (\operatorname{Cov}(w,z)) to privilege robust traits; (\pi_{\text{drive}}) captures how locked the life-cycle throughput is. ([www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk][4])

### 3) Invariants and tests

* **Invariant 1 (lock):** At fixed (E), there exists a **plateau** in (\pi_{\text{rate}}(\pi_{\text{drive}})) for (\pi_{\text{drive}}\ge \pi^*) (viability lock).
* **Invariant 2 (curvature sign):** Near viability loss, the second variation of throughput vs. trait (adaptive landscape) becomes **positively curved** along the exiting direction; in adaptive-dynamics language, the selection gradient reverses and you see a **branching or collapse** predicted by the master-equation derivation. ([IIASA PURE][5])

**Minimal falsifiers (ecology).**

1. Under do(\Gamma!\uparrow) (added load) with (E) fixed, if (\pi_{\text{rate}}) **does not** drop with a concomitant sharpening (gap-like rise) in the mode spectrum of population fluctuations, the (\Gamma!\leftrightarrow)“stiffness/pressure” mapping fails.
2. If the **trait-weighted covariance** term in the Price decomposition fails to track the predicted sign under do(z) or do(E) (holding (\Gamma) fixed), the (K_\tau!\leftrightarrow)“viability throughput” mapping fails. ([www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk][4])

---

## Porting the recipe to cognition and social systems

* **Cognition.** Take (K_\tau) as **task-throughput coherence** (e.g., sustained working-memory rhythm), (\Gamma) as **load or conflict** (dual-task interference, sensory uncertainty), and (\tilde g) as the **latent transport geometry** of neural states. The SCM declares which manipulations are “drive” (entrainment) vs “load” (noise, conflict). Invariants: a **lock plateau** in performance vs entrainment and a **curvature spike** (bundle focusing) at access loss; the Marr split keeps mechanism separate from invariant. ([Colin Phillips][3])

* **Social systems.** Let (K_\tau) be **throughput of coordination** (task completion, consensus rate), (\Gamma) the **dissonance/pressure** modulating thresholds, and (\tilde g) the **communication transport** metric. The SCM is a threshold/complex-contagion DAG; invariants are (i) **lock plateau** in productivity vs coordination, and (ii) **early-warning** rise in autocorrelation/variance before cascades—checked with preregistered nulls and without operational prediction. (Methodological bridge only; ethics note in the paper keeps this retrospective.)

---

## Why this bridge is conservative

* It **forces** nondimensionalization first (so correspondences aren’t unit tricks). ([Wikipedia][1])
* It **separates** invariants from mechanisms (Marr), so failures are interpretable: wrong invariant vs wrong implementation. ([Colin Phillips][3])
* It **demands interventions** (Pearl SCM) or high-quality natural experiments; correlation alone is never enough. ([Amazon][2])

**Bottom line.** The correspondence is a **discipline**, not a metaphor: (1) nondimensionalize, (2) fix a causal scaffold, (3) preregister invariants and kill-criteria. The worked ecology example shows how (K_\tau) maps to viability and (\Gamma) to selection pressure with explicit tests; analogous constructions for cognition and social systems follow the same recipe.

# Conscious Access as Triadic Resonance — Phase-Locking, Complexity, and Critical Slowing

**Abstract**
We propose that **conscious access** corresponds to a *triad-locked* mesoscopic resonance: three coupled rhythms (e.g., theta–alpha–gamma) form a phase-stable manifold that maximizes temporal coherence under load. The manifold’s stability leaves three measurable traces: (i) a **phase-locking ridge** across bands and areas, (ii) sustained **perturbational complexity** of evoked spatiotemporal responses, and (iii) **critical slowing**—predictable changes in recovery rates and variance—at transitions that break the lock. We operationalize each trace with standard tools: phase-locking statistics/cross-frequency coupling, TMS–EEG PCI, and early-warning indicators used in seizures and other neural state changes. We emphasize falsifiability and note active debates about universality of early-warning signals. ([PubMed][1])

**Main Text**
**Triadic resonance as mechanism.** Numerous results support the view that cognition leverages **coherence** between neuronal groups: rhythmic synchronization gates effective communication, biases gain, and temporally aligns inputs and outputs. The “communication-through-coherence” hypothesis shows how inter-areal timing relationships modulate information routing. At the same time, **cross-frequency coupling**—notably theta–gamma interactions implicated in working memory and hippocampal coding—provides a substrate on which multiple items or features can be multiplexed within a cycle. We adopt these as premises for an operational definition: a *conscious-access episode* is a period during which a triad of rhythms forms a **phase-stable, cross-frequency–locked** configuration that supports durable, reportable content. ([PMC][2])

**Trace 1: the phase-locking ridge.** The **phase locking value** (PLV) and related phase statistics detect stable phase relations across trials and channels; local cross-frequency metrics (e.g., theta–gamma phase–amplitude coupling) complement inter-areal measures. The triad hypothesis predicts a **ridge** in time–frequency representations: co-occurring increases in (i) within-band inter-areal PLV and (ii) cross-frequency locking across the triad, with reproducible lead–lag structure. The ridge should strengthen with task demands requiring maintained access and collapse when access is lost or disrupted. ([PubMed][1])

**Trace 2: perturbational complexity stays high on-cycle.** The **Perturbational Complexity Index** (PCI) captures the algorithmic complexity of cortex-wide responses to TMS; it robustly distinguishes wakefulness and dream-rich states from anesthesia and dreamless sleep. Under the triad hypothesis, on-cycle access maintains **high, sustained PCI**, whereas transitions that break the lock reduce it. PCI therefore functions as an **integration–differentiation proxy** for the resonance manifold: lock → rich, differentiated but integrated responses; unlock → simplification/fragmentation. Evidence from anesthesia paradigms supports the complexity drop with loss of consciousness and recovery with “ketamine dreams,” a useful dissociation test. ([PubMed][3])

**Trace 3: critical slowing at transitions.** If access failure is a **bifurcation** of the resonance manifold, generic theory predicts **critical slowing**: increased autocorrelation, variance, and slower recovery from perturbations as the system approaches a tipping point. Recent work in human epilepsy reports precisely such markers preceding seizures; other studies identify distance-to-criticality measures with predictive value, while a parallel literature cautions against assuming universality without careful null models and noise controls. This mixed record is a feature, not a bug: the triad view is **falsified** if canonical early-warning signatures fail to appear at well-identified access transitions despite adequate signal-to-noise and sampling. ([Nature][4])

**Criticality and avalanches.** Beyond discrete rhythms, spontaneous activity often displays **neuronal avalanches** with power-law statistics, widely interpreted as signs of near-critical dynamics supporting maximal dynamic range. The triad picture is compatible: avalanches describe scale-free *background* exploration, while the triad supplies *task-bound locking*. A decisive test is whether access epochs show (i) preserved avalanche statistics in the background and (ii) **superposed triad locking** in the foreground; a collapse of both would indicate global de-tuning rather than selective unlocking. ([Journal of Neuroscience][5])

**Falsifiability protocol.**

1. **Ridge test:** Pre-register triad bands; require concurrent increases in inter-areal PLV and cross-frequency coupling with consistent leads/lags across sessions and tasks. Absence or inconsistent lag structure falsifies the triad claim. ([PubMed][1])
2. **PCI test:** Evoke TMS–EEG during access and non-access; demand stable, elevated PCI on-cycle relative to matched off-cycle baselines. No PCI separation → reject. ([PubMed][3])
3. **Slowing test:** Quantify autocorrelation/variance and impulse-response recovery near access loss (e.g., pre-seizure, anesthesia induction). Failure to find consistent slowing with appropriate controls weighs against a bifurcation account. ([Nature][4])

**Claims**

* Conscious access corresponds to a **triad-locked** resonance with a measurable phase-locking ridge across bands and areas. ([PubMed][1])
* **PCI** remains high on-cycle and drops at lock failure, matching anesthesia and dream data. ([PubMed][3])
* **Critical slowing** precedes access transitions; robust nulls are required, and consistent failures falsify the bifurcation framing. ([Nature][4])

# Geometry of the Resonance Manifold — Curvature Spikes and Topological Breaks

**Abstract**
If conscious access corresponds to a *triad-locked* resonance (Sec. 9), its stability should have **geometric** signatures: nearby coherence geodesics converge when the manifold is “stiff,” and **curvature spikes** precede lock failure. We operationalize this with (i) **geodesic deviation** diagnostics (Jacobi fields) adapted to neural state trajectories; (ii) **network curvatures** (Forman–Ricci, Ollivier–Ricci) computed on dynamic functional graphs; and (iii) **mode geometry** via connectome-specific harmonics. We predict pretransition **spikes in discrete curvature** and **caustic-like focusing/defocusing** in state-space bundles, then give falsifiers using seizure datasets, altered-state paradigms, and task transitions. ([Wikipedia][1])

**Main Text**
**Geodesic deviation in state space.** In differential geometry, the separation (J(t)) between neighboring geodesics obeys the **Jacobi equation**, with curvature terms governing focusing or dispersion of bundles; in GR this encodes tidal effects. Translating the idea, let neural population states evolve on a low-dimensional **manifold** learned from data; treat time-warped trajectories during access as **coherence geodesics** of an effective metric (Sec. 2–3). Then the **second variation** of the coherence action predicts that impending lock failure manifests as **growth** of transverse Jacobi norms and, at the break, **conjugate-point–like** pinch events (caustics). This yields a concrete assay: compute local bundle divergence rates and look for **peaks** at access transitions. ([Wikipedia][1])

**Network curvature as a fast proxy.** When only graphs are available (EEG/MEG/fMRI functional networks), continuous geometry can be approximated by **discrete Ricci curvatures**. Forman–Ricci and Ollivier–Ricci curvatures quantify, respectively, higher-order flow around edges and transport-based neighborhood overlap; both are sensitive to **organization/robustness** in brain networks and capture age- and condition-dependent changes. Prior studies show these curvatures detect altered patterns in clinical cohorts and track mesoscale reconfiguration; related work uses **Ricci flow** on graphs for change detection. We therefore predict **curvature spikes** (edge- or subgraph-level) preceding or accompanying access loss or seizure onset, reflecting a local collapse of the resonance manifold. Failure to detect such spikes under adequate SNR and sampling would weigh against the geometric framing. ([PMC][2])

**Mode geometry via connectome harmonics.** A complementary route decomposes activity into **connectome-specific harmonic waves**—eigenmodes of the structural graph Laplacian. Empirically, these modes predict resting-state networks and altered states; they provide a natural basis to quantify **manifold bending** as **mode-mixing events**: near a break, energy leaks from a compact band-limited triad into higher modes, concomitant with curvature growth inferred from network measures. Thus, three independent instruments—Jacobi diagnostics, discrete curvature, and mode spectra—should **cohere** in their timing around transitions. ([Nature][3])

**Evidence contours and decisive tests.** Work on **brain criticality** links clinical transitions (e.g., seizures) to approach-to-criticality markers; geometry adds a structural layer: *where* in the network and *on which modes* the system bends. Seizure-spread models and empirical analyses already quantify transition structure; adding curvature/Jacobi readouts turns these into **transport geometry** tests. We recommend three paradigms: (a) pre-seizure windows in stereo-EEG, (b) anesthesia induction/emergence, (c) task-bound access switches. In each, demand **coincident** findings: (1) rising discrete curvature on a sparse set of edges (a “backbone”); (2) growth of Jacobi norms for nearby state trajectories; (3) transient broadening in connectome-harmonic spectra. Mixed or incoherent signatures falsify the geometric claim. ([PLOS][4])

**Topological breaks.** Beyond smooth curvature, network topology may undergo **phase transitions** detectable by Euler-characteristic or Betti-number shifts; reports of topological transitions in functional brain networks suggest a generic route to **singular** reorganizations. Our account predicts that such topological signals **co-occur** with curvature spikes at lock failure. If topology jumps without curvature growth (or vice versa) in well-controlled settings, the “curvature-first” mechanism is incomplete. ([Physical Review Links][5])

**Falsifiability protocol.**

1. **Jacobi bundle assay:** Embed neural trajectories; compute local bundle divergence and identify peaks aligned (within preregistered windows) to loss-of-access events. Null if peaks are absent or randomly timed. ([Wikipedia][1])
2. **Discrete-curvature alarm:** Track Forman–Ricci/Ollivier–Ricci over dynamic graphs; require pretransition spikes on a consistent subgraph backbone across sessions. Lack of reproducible spikes falsifies. ([PMC][2])
3. **Mode-spill test:** In connectome harmonics, look for energy spill from the triad band into higher modes concurrent with (1–2). No coordinated spill → reject the manifold-bending account. ([Nature][3])

**Claims**

* **Curvature spikes** (Jacobi growth, discrete Ricci increases) precede or accompany resonance-lock failure in neural dynamics. ([Wikipedia][1])
* **Connectome-harmonic** spectra broaden at breaks, aligning with curvature diagnostics and critical-transition theory. ([Nature][3])
* Absence of coordinated (geometry + topology + spectral) markers in controlled transitions **falsifies** the manifold account. ([Physical Review Links][5])

# Social Cascades as Threshold Dynamics — The (\Theta) Field and Early Warnings

**Abstract**
We model collective eruptions—protests, boycotts, abrupt norm shifts—as **threshold cascades** over social networks, driven by a mesoscopic “dissonance pressure” (\Theta). Classic threshold theory, global-cascade results, and complex-contagion findings jointly imply that small parametric changes in susceptibility or reinforcement can precipitate **system-scale events**. We operationalize falsifiable early-warning indicators (EWI) from critical-transition theory and specify how to disentangle true proximity to tipping from mere noise or exogenous shocks. (Background: Granovetter thresholds; Watts global cascades; Dodds–Watts generalized contagion; complex contagion; EWI/critical slowing.) ([University of Chicago Press Journals][1])

**Main Text**
**Threshold backbone.** In threshold models, an individual switches when the fraction (or weighted count) of active neighbors exceeds their personal threshold; the population-level outcome depends on how thresholds and ties are distributed. Granovetter’s formulation captured the **micro–macro** bridge; subsequent work showed that in sparse random networks, even rare seeds can trigger **global cascades** when vulnerable clusters percolate—while dense clustering can either inhibit or promote spread depending on reinforcement needs. These results give us a precise control parameter: a local **(\Theta)-load** (perceived dissonance, grievance, or incentive imbalance) that lowers effective thresholds and expands the vulnerable set. ([University of Chicago Press Journals][1])

**Simple vs. complex contagion.** Not all cascades are equal. Some behaviors diffuse via **simple contagion** (one contact suffices); others require **multiple reinforcing exposures**—**complex contagion**—to overcome risk or coordination costs. Empirical work on online diffusion and topic-specific hashtags shows that political and identity-laden adoptions tend to require **reinforcement**, making long, weak ties **insufficient** by themselves; clustered neighborhoods supply the needed redundancy. Our (\Theta) field encodes this by raising or lowering the **reinforcement threshold**: high (\Theta) opens the gate to complex contagions by converting redundant contacts into decisive evidence. ([University of Chicago Press Journals][2])

**Generalized contagion and memory.** Dodds & Watts unify contagion types by explicit **exposure memory**; three universal dynamical classes emerge (epidemic threshold, critical mass, and an intermediate). This suggests a measurement program: estimate effective memory length and the two parameters that place a population in one of the classes, then track how (\Theta) shifts those parameters toward the cascade regime. ([PubMed][3])

**Empirical structure of online cascades.** Large-scale audits of diffusion show a striking regularity: **most cascades are small and shallow**; even “viral” events often concentrate adoptions within one degree of a few seeds. Structural virality varies by domain, but deep, branching trees are the exception. This baseline matters for falsification: if a (\Theta)-surge truly pushes a system toward a tipping region, we should observe **distributional changes**—fatter tails, greater structural virality—relative to the domain’s typical shallow profile. ([Sharad Goel][4])

**Early-warning indicators (EWI).** Near **critical transitions**, generic theory predicts **critical slowing** (rising lag-1 autocorrelation), increased variance, and sometimes **flickering** between quasi-states. These have been proposed and tested across domains (ecosystems, climate, neuroscience). We adopt a cautious stance: compute EWIs on detrended, windowed cascade activity; require **consistency across indicators** and stability under null resampling; and pre-register event windows and network partitions to avoid data dredging. Failure to find robust EWI structure prior to major cascades—after adequate sampling and controls—**falsifies** the claim that the event was an endogenous threshold crossing rather than an exogenous shock. ([PubMed][5])

**Forecasting, with caveats.** Cascade-based nowcasting of **social unrest** has shown partial success, especially where precursor “activity cascades” in communication networks are measurable. But prediction attempts raise ethical and methodological concerns (surveillance, chilling effects, selection biases). We restrict use to **retrospective testing** of the (\Theta) hypothesis and **aggregate** early-warning dashboards; any operational deployment should comply with clear safeguards. ([PMC][6])

**Operational falsifiers.**

1. **Reinforcement failure:** In domains known to require complex contagion (e.g., political hashtags), elevated (\Theta) should **reduce exposure count** needed for adoption; if reinforcement thresholds remain unchanged across (\Theta) shifts, the mapping is wrong. ([Explorer Bee][7])
2. **Tail thickening:** Entering high-(\Theta) regimes should produce **heavier diffusion tails** and increased structural virality beyond the domain baseline; absence of tail change falsifies the tipping interpretation. ([Sharad Goel][4])
3. **EWI coherence:** Approaching major cascades, at least two of {AC(1), variance, flicker rate} should rise consistently across partitions; inconsistent or null EWI patterns under robust controls argue against endogenous proximity to a threshold. ([PubMed][5])

**Claims**

* Social eruptions can be modeled as **threshold cascades** modulated by a mesoscopic (\Theta) field; complex contagion governs reinforcement-heavy domains. ([University of Chicago Press Journals][1])
* Generic **early-warning signals** (critical slowing, variance rise) distinguish endogenous tipping from exogenous shocks when applied with preregistered controls. ([PubMed][5])
* Baseline audits show most cascades are **small/shallow**; genuine high-(\Theta) phases should measurably **thicken tails** and increase structural virality. ([Sharad Goel][4])

# Time-First Philosophy — Ontology, Conscious Access, and Unification by Transport

**Abstract**
We close by situating the time-substrate proposal within three debates: (i) **ontology of spacetime**, where “spacetime from entanglement” programs suggest geometric structure is emergent rather than primitive; (ii) **the mind–brain relation**, where global neuronal workspace (GNW) and integrated information theory (IIT) provide competing mechanistic targets for “conscious access”; and (iii) **unification**, historically pursued via gauge groups but equally well cast as **geometry of transport** on bundles. We argue for a tentative, empirically anchored realism: treat **time-as-substrate** as the primitive and spacetime as a relational bookkeeping that condenses optimal coherence flow. This stance is compatible with entanglement-driven geometry, demands head-to-head tests against GNW/IIT, and reframes unification as a matter of **connections and geodesics** rather than of catalogued internal symmetries. ([SpringerLink][1])

**Main Text**
**(1) Ontology: time versus spacetime.** A large body of work treats connected spacetime as **emergent from entanglement** structure; sever entanglement and the manifold pinches apart, entangle and it glues back together. This is a powerful explanatory direction—but it leaves open *what the entangling dynamics are “in.”* The time-first thesis answers: in **time**. Time is the primitive arena in which coherence is organized; spacetime is a projection of **coherence geodesics** negotiated under gradients of temporal pressure. This neither denies nor diminishes entanglement constructions; rather, it positions them as maps from informational structure to **emergent geometry**, while the substrate law supplies the dynamical grain driving those structures. ([SpringerLink][1])

Skeptics of time’s fundamentality often cite approaches where time dissolves at the deepest level. An opposing line—articulated in recent philosophical work—defends the **reality and directionality of time**: laws act *in* time; the arrow is not an illusion. Our program aligns with this defense insofar as it treats time’s directedness as primitive and uses it to define conserved coherence under symmetry (Noether) and transport metrics for dynamics. The point is not to settle metaphysics by fiat but to **cash out the bet empirically**, via the cross-domain falsifiers we have enumerated. ([Quanta Magazine][2])

**(2) Conscious access: dynamics, not magic.** Competing theories—**GNW** and **IIT**—specify testable criteria: network ignition and reportability (GNW), or high integrated information with structured causal borders (IIT). Our triadic-resonance account commutes with both as a **dynamical substrate**: a phase-locked manifold supports GNW-style ignition and tends to increase perturbational complexity, while breakdowns show critical-slowing signatures. The burden is now experimental: if conscious access can be sustained *without* the triad’s ridge, or if PCI remains high **without** resonance, the time-first mechanism is incomplete. Conversely, systematic co-occurrence of ridge–PCI–criticality would argue that GNW/IIT are **phenotypes** of a deeper transport geometry. ([PMC][3])

**(3) Unification: from groups to geometry.** The twentieth century achieved unification by **symmetry catalogues**—U(1), SU(2), SU(3)—encoded in Yang–Mills gauge fields; mathematically, this is the language of **connections on principal bundles** and their curvatures. Our proposal keeps that machinery but flips the emphasis: treat **transport geometry** (the induced metric for coherence geodesics and the fiber connections encoding local rephasings) as the *unifying object*, with gauge groups appearing as **stabilizers of the cycle structure**. In practice, this is a shift from “what group?” to “what connection and geodesics?”, intensifying the role of curvature and holonomy as observables that can be cross-checked from leptons to cosmology to cognition. ([PhilSci Archive][4])

**Epistemic posture.** Philosophically, this is a modest **structural realism**: commit to the transport structures (connections, curvatures, invariants, geodesics) that survive across domains and iterated tests, while remaining agnostic about surplus metaphysics. The gamble is that by positing a single **time-substrate law** (maximize coherence; geometry = transport under (\nabla\Gamma)), we produce a web of predictions tight enough to live or die as a package. If future data converge on GNW/IIT without triadic resonance; if lepton (g!-!2) and cosmological fits cannot be co-satisfied; if social cascades refuse early-warning structure under controlled measurement—then the time-first stance should be **abandoned**. That is how it earns the right to be taken seriously.

**Coda.** Unification is not (only) about more elaborate group catalogues. It is about **one grammar of motion**: signals trace geodesics in a connection-laced medium whose **clock** is intrinsic. If the evidence continues to point this way, then space will read as an **index of resonance**, matter as **localized stiffness**, mind as **locked transport**, and society as **thresholded flow**—all pages in a single **time-resonance** book.

**Claims**

* A time-first ontology is compatible with and **complements** entanglement-based emergence of spacetime, by supplying the dynamical substrate that entangles. ([SpringerLink][1])
* Conscious access should show **coherent triad locking** alongside GNW/IIT markers; dissociations falsify the mechanism. ([PMC][3])
* Unification by **transport geometry** (connections, holonomy, geodesics) subsumes the gauge catalogue and yields cross-domain observables. ([PhilSci Archive][4])

# Appendix A — From the Coherence Action to Euler–Lagrange and Noether Currents

## A.1 Setup: the coherence action

Let (q(t)\in\mathbb{R}^n) collect the mesoscopic state variables that carry the **resonant pattern** (Ki) (e.g., phases/slow amplitudes, order parameters). Let (\Gamma(t,\mathbf{x})) denote the **temporal pressure** field felt along the system’s worldline (background or dynamical, as noted below). The **coherence action** is
[
\mathcal{S}*p[q;\Gamma] ;=; \int*{t_1}^{t_2} \mathcal{L}*p\big(q,\dot q,\Gamma,\dot\Gamma,t\big),dt,
\qquad \mathcal{L}*p \equiv K*{\tau}(q,\dot q;\vartheta) - V*{\Gamma}(\Gamma,\dot\Gamma;q,t),
]
where (K_{\tau}) is a “kinetic” term that **increases with temporal coherence** over the intrinsic cycle, and (V_{\Gamma}) is a **load/penalty** induced by (\Gamma). The variable (\vartheta(t)\in[0,2\pi)) is an **intrinsic phase** that parametrizes the cycle; below we enforce its periodicity with a constraint.

Two regimes:

* **Exogenous (\Gamma)** (measurement/phenomenology): treat (\Gamma(t)) as given; vary only (q(t)) and (\vartheta(t)).
* **Endogenous (\Gamma)** (theory/computation): include (\Gamma) among dynamical variables and add a regularizer (e.g., quadratic (\dot\Gamma) or gradient penalties) inside (V_\Gamma).

We assume standard differentiability and smooth endpoints for variations; boundary terms are handled in the usual way (e.g., fixed endpoints for (q), or natural boundary conditions). For general background on the EL formalism and Noether’s theorem, see classic sources. ([College of Science and Engineering][1])

---

## A.2 Cycle constraint and admissible variations

The **cycle time** (\tau_p) closes the dynamics via
[
\vartheta(t+\tau_p)-\vartheta(t) ;=; 2\pi.
]
We encode this with a Lagrange multiplier (\lambda(t)) by adding
[
\mathcal{L}_{\rm cyc} ;=; \lambda(t),\Big(\dot\vartheta - \tfrac{2\pi}{\tau_p}\Big),
]
so the **augmented Lagrangian** is (\mathcal{L}^\star \equiv \mathcal{L}*p + \mathcal{L}*{\rm cyc}). Variation w.r.t. (\lambda) enforces the cycle closure; variation w.r.t. (\vartheta) yields the **cycle-current** conservation (A.6).

> Practical note. If you parameterize (q) directly by (\vartheta) (i.e., use phase as the curve parameter), the constraint is implicit and (\mathcal{L}_{\rm cyc}) can be dropped; the Noether current for phase-shifts then appears as a reparametrization invariant.

---

## A.3 Euler–Lagrange equations

### A.3.1 Variation with respect to (q)

For exogenous (\Gamma), the EL equations for (q) follow immediately:
[
\frac{d}{dt},\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}*p}{\partial \dot q_i};-;\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}*p}{\partial q_i};=;0,
\qquad i=1,\dots,n.
\tag{A.1}
]
Expanding (\mathcal{L}*p=K*\tau(q,\dot q;\vartheta)-V*{\Gamma}(\Gamma,\dot\Gamma;q,t)) makes explicit that (V*\Gamma) can exert **generalized forces** on (q) through its (q)-dependence:
[
\frac{d}{dt},\partial_{\dot q}K_\tau - \partial_q K_\tau ;=; -,\partial_q V_\Gamma(\Gamma,\dot\Gamma;q,t).
\tag{A.2}
]

### A.3.2 Variation with respect to (\Gamma) (endogenous case)

If (\Gamma) is dynamical, add a quadratic regularizer (or another convex kinetic term) to (V_\Gamma), e.g.
[
V_\Gamma(\Gamma,\dot\Gamma;q,t) = U(\Gamma;q,t) ;+; \tfrac{\chi}{2},\dot\Gamma^{,2},
]
with stiffness (\chi>0). Then
[
\frac{d}{dt},\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}*p}{\partial \dot \Gamma};-;\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}*p}{\partial \Gamma}
=; -,\chi,\ddot\Gamma;-;\partial*\Gamma U(\Gamma;q,t)
;=;0.
\tag{A.3}
]
In spatially extended settings replace (\Gamma(t)) by (\Gamma(t,\mathbf{x})) and (\dot\Gamma) by (\partial_t\Gamma); gradient penalties ((\nabla\Gamma)^2) appear inside (V*\Gamma) and yield diffusion-like terms in the EL equations.

### A.3.3 Variation with respect to (\vartheta) and (\lambda)

The multiplier enforces the constraint:
[
\partial_\lambda \mathcal{L}^\star = \dot\vartheta-\tfrac{2\pi}{\tau_p}=0.
\tag{A.4}
]
The (\vartheta) EL equation reads
[
\frac{d}{dt},\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^\star}{\partial \dot\vartheta};-;\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^\star}{\partial \vartheta} ;=; 0
;\Rightarrow;
\dot\lambda ;=; \partial_\vartheta K_\tau(q,\dot q;\vartheta),
\tag{A.5}
]
i.e., the cycle current (identified with (\lambda), up to a constant) changes only when (K_\tau) depends explicitly on (\vartheta).

The derivation is a direct application of standard calculus-of-variations machinery. ([College of Science and Engineering][1])

---

## A.4 Noether currents (three we will use)

Noether’s first theorem states: **every continuous symmetry** of the action generates a conserved current. We list the three relevant to the text and provide their forms. ([arXiv][2])

### (i) Time translation ⇒ “coherence energy”

If (\mathcal{L}_p) has **no explicit** time dependence, ( \partial \mathcal{L}_p/\partial t=0 ), then the **energy-like invariant**
[
\mathcal{H}*p ;\equiv; \dot q\cdot\partial*{\dot q}\mathcal{L}*p + \dot\Gamma,\partial*{\dot \Gamma}\mathcal{L}*p + \dot\vartheta,\partial*{\dot\vartheta}\mathcal{L}^\star ;-; \mathcal{L}^\star
\tag{A.6}
]
is conserved, (d\mathcal{H}_p/dt = 0). In the exogenous-(\Gamma) case (no (\dot\Gamma) term, (\dot\vartheta}=2\pi/\tau_p) from the constraint), this reduces to the familiar Legendre transform of (\mathcal{L}_p). The proof follows the textbook route (stationary action + invariance under (t\mapsto t+\epsilon)). ([College of Science and Engineering][1])

### (ii) Global cycle shift (\vartheta\mapsto \vartheta+\epsilon) ⇒ “coherence charge”

If (\mathcal{L}*p) depends on (\vartheta) only through (\dot\vartheta) (i.e., is **invariant** under global phase shifts), then
[
Q*{\rm cyc} ;\equiv; \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^\star}{\partial \dot\vartheta} ;=; \lambda
\tag{A.7}
]
is conserved: (\dot Q_{\rm cyc}=0). This is the cycle-phase Noether charge; physically, it quantifies **on-cycle coherence** (the “momentum” conjugate to (\vartheta)). In experiments, (Q_{\rm cyc}) maps to stable rhythm counts (phase-winding), or—after coarse-graining—to conserved on-cycle “coherence energy.”

### (iii) Multi-cycle rephasings (Ki\mapsto U,Ki) ⇒ internal currents

Let (q) include (m) complex amplitudes (\psi^i) (or their real/imag parts) spanning a **pattern fiber**. Suppose (\mathcal{L}_p) is invariant under a global (U\in G) (compact Lie) action, (\psi \mapsto U\psi) with generators (T^a). The infinitesimal symmetry (\delta\psi^i = \epsilon_a, (T^a)^i{}*j \psi^j) yields the **Noether currents**
[
J^a ;\equiv; \Re!\Big(,\partial*{\dot\psi}\mathcal{L}*p\Big)*{i}, (T^a)^i{}_j, \psi^j,
\qquad \frac{d}{dt}J^a=0,
\tag{A.8}
]
(one current per generator). When the symmetry is **gauged** ((U=U(t)) or (U(x)) in field settings), these currents source a compensating connection (Appendix D). This is the standard passage from global symmetry to conserved current to gauge structure. ([arXiv][2])

---

## A.5 Natural boundary terms and constraints

If some coordinates are **free at the endpoints**, their variations do not vanish; then the boundary terms in (\delta\mathcal{S}*p) must vanish separately, yielding **natural boundary conditions**:
[
\Big(\partial*{\dot q}\mathcal{L}*p\cdot \delta q\Big)\Big|*{t_1}^{t_2} = 0 ;\Rightarrow; \partial_{\dot q}\mathcal{L}*p\Big|*{t=t_{1,2}}=0
\quad\text{for unconstrained (q) at the boundary.}
\tag{A.9}
]
For inequality constraints (e.g., admissible bands for (\vartheta)), use standard Kuhn–Tucker multipliers within the variational calculus. A clear reference treatment is given in modern lecture notes on the calculus of variations. ([College of Science and Engineering][1])

---

## A.6 Small-gradient (ray) limit and preview of Appendix B

Linearizing the EL equations near an extremal and retaining first-order inhomogeneities of (\Gamma) gives a **ray equation** for coherence transport:
[
\ddot q ;+; \Gamma^i{}*{jk}(q),\dot q^j \dot q^k ;=; f^i(\nabla \Gamma) ;+; \mathcal{O}(|\nabla\Gamma|^2),
\tag{A.10}
]
where (\Gamma^i{}*{jk}) (Christoffel symbols) arise from the **second variation** metric (\tilde g) on the cycle manifold, and the forcing (f^i) contains the first derivatives of the pressure field (details in Appendix B). This is the stepping-stone to **geodesic deviation** and the curvature diagnostics used in the main text.

---

## A.7 What to measure (operational map)

* **(\mathcal{H}_p) (time-translation current):** on-cycle invariance of a coherence-energy observable; violations indicate explicit nonstationarity.
* **(Q_{\rm cyc}) (cycle-shift current):** phase-winding stability or a locked count per (\tau_p); breaks at detuning/transition.
* **(J^a) (internal currents):** conserved quantities tied to global rephasings; in gauged settings, become sources for a connection (cf. Appendix D).

These are the **referee-grade hooks**: they translate the variational language into numbers to plot.

# Appendix B — Second Variation, Effective Metric, and Geodesic Deviation

## B.1 Geometry from the second variation

Let (q(t)\in\mathcal{M}) be the mesoscopic state curve (coordinates (q^i), (i=1,\dots,n)) that extremizes the coherence action
[
\mathcal{S}*p[q;\Gamma]=\int*{t_1}^{t_2}!\mathcal{L}*p\big(q,\dot q;\Gamma,\dot\Gamma,t\big),dt,
\qquad \mathcal{L}*p = K*\tau(q,\dot q;\vartheta)-V*\Gamma(\Gamma,\dot\Gamma;q,t).
]
Let (q_\star(t)) be an extremal: it satisfies the Euler–Lagrange equations (Appendix A). Consider a **variation field** (\eta(t)) along (q_\star) with fixed endpoints (\eta(t_1)=\eta(t_2)=0). The **second variation** reads
[
\delta^2\mathcal{S}*p[q*\star;\eta] ;=; \frac12\int_{t_1}^{t_2}!
\Big[,\eta^i,\mathcal{A}*{ij},\eta^j ;+;2\eta^i,\mathcal{B}*{ij},\dot\eta^j;+;\dot\eta^i,\mathcal{C}*{ij},\dot\eta^j,\Big],dt,
\tag{B.1}
]
with coefficient tensors evaluated on (q*\star):
[
\mathcal{C}_{ij}\equiv \frac{\partial^2\mathcal{L}*p}{\partial \dot q^i,\partial \dot q^j},\quad
\mathcal{B}*{ij}\equiv \frac{\partial^2\mathcal{L}*p}{\partial q^i,\partial \dot q^j},\quad
\mathcal{A}*{ij}\equiv \frac{\partial^2\mathcal{L}_p}{\partial q^i,\partial q^j}.
\tag{B.2}
]

Assume the **Legendre condition** holds ((\mathcal{C}) positive definite along the extremal). Then we can read (\mathcal{C}) as a Riemannian metric on the tangent bundle over the curve. Define the **effective transport metric**
[
\boxed{;\tilde g_{ij}(t);:=;\mathcal{C}*{ij}\big(q*\star(t),\dot q_\star(t);\Gamma(t),\dot\Gamma(t)\big);}
\tag{B.3}
]
and the associated (Levi–Civita) connection (\tilde\Gamma^i{}_{jk}) computed from (\tilde g). After a standard completion of squares on (B.1) and discarding boundary terms (fixed endpoints), the **Jacobi (geodesic–deviation) equation** emerges (below). Intuitively: the second variation endows the extremal with a local quadratic form—**the metric that transport “feels”**—and the curvature of this metric controls how nearby optimal paths separate or focus.

> **Operational meaning.** In practice, estimate (\tilde g) by fitting (\partial^2\mathcal{L}_p/\partial\dot q^2) on the observed extremal (or its maximum-likelihood surrogate); then compute Christoffels and curvature numerically along the trajectory.

---

## B.2 Jacobi equation (continuous geometry)

Let (q_\star(\cdot)) be an extremal and (\eta(\cdot)) a variation field along it. The **Jacobi equation** for geodesic deviation in ((\mathcal{M},\tilde g)) is
[
\boxed{;\tilde\nabla_{\dot q_\star}\tilde\nabla_{\dot q_\star}\eta^i ;+; \tilde R^i{}*{,k\ell m},\dot q*\star^{,k},\eta^\ell,\dot q_\star^{,m} ;=; \tilde F^i;}
\tag{B.4}
]
where (\tilde R) is the Riemann tensor of (\tilde g), (\tilde\nabla) its covariant derivative, and (\tilde F^i) collects **non-geometric inhomogeneities** originating from explicit dependence on (\Gamma,\dot\Gamma,t) in (\mathcal{L}_p). In the **adiabatic–background** regime (slow (\Gamma), no explicit (t)-dependence), (\tilde F=0) and (B.4) reduces to the standard geodesic–deviation law. Then:

* **Focusing:** if the **sectional curvature** (\tilde K(\dot q_\star\wedge \eta)) is positive on a 2-plane, neighboring geodesics **converge**;
* **Defocusing:** negative curvature yields **dispersion**;
* **Conjugate points / caustics:** zeros of a nontrivial Jacobi field (\eta) at two distinct times signal **focal events**, often preceding lock failure (main text Sec. 10).

> **What to compute from data.** Estimate (\eta) by tracking a small “bundle” of state trajectories (e.g., trial repetitions) in an embedded manifold; compute empirical (|\eta|) and its second covariant derivative along (q_\star); test for pre-registered **peaks** at transitions.

---

## B.3 Discrete graphs: Ricci proxies

Many datasets give **dynamic graphs** (EEG/MEG/fMRI functional networks) rather than smooth state-space curves. Then we approximate curvature with **discrete Ricci curvatures**:

* **Ollivier–Ricci** on an edge (e=(u,v)): (\kappa_{\text{OR}}(u,v)=1-W_1(m_u,m_v)/d(u,v)) with (W_1) the earth-mover distance between neighborhood measures (m_u,m_v).
* **Forman–Ricci**: (\kappa_{\text{FR}}(e)=w_e\Big(\tfrac{w_u}{w_e}+\tfrac{w_v}{w_e}-\sum_{e\sim u} \tfrac{w_u}{\sqrt{w_e w_{e'}}}-\sum_{e\sim v}\tfrac{w_v}{\sqrt{w_e w_{e'}}}\Big)) (weights (w) adapted to signal strengths).

These provide **fast surrogates** for the sign/peaks of (\tilde K). In Section 10 we require **pretransition spikes** (edge-localized) as a falsifiable marker.

## B.4 Ray (eikonal) limit and the small-angle deflection law

To expose the **(\nabla\Gamma) → bending** link, adopt a ray approximation where (i) the speed along the cycle is nearly constant, (ii) (\Gamma) varies weakly and smoothly across a transverse coordinate (y) (the **slow-gradient** regime), and (iii) (V_\Gamma) contributes a refractivity-like weight to (\tilde g).

### B.4.1 Effective refractive index for coherence

Assume (\mathcal{L}*p) takes the separable, local form (sufficient near a locked orbit)
[
\mathcal{L}*p \simeq \tfrac12,a(q),|\dot q|^2 ;-; U!\big(\Gamma(q)\big),
\tag{B.5}
]
with (a(q)>0). Then (\tilde g*{ij}=a(q),\delta*{ij}) (in local normal coordinates). The **eikonal equation** for optical-mechanics–type rays yields an **index field**
[
n(q);\propto;\sqrt{\frac{a(q)}{E_{\text{coh}}+U\big(\Gamma(q)\big)}},
\tag{B.6}
]
where (E_{\text{coh}}) is the conserved “coherence energy” from Appendix A (Noether time-translation current). Gradients in (U(\Gamma)) act like **index gradients** (\nabla n), bending rays.

> Many other decompositions lead to the same first-order result: what matters is that the second variation defines (\tilde g) and that (V_\Gamma) enters the **denominator** of the eikonal speed.

### B.4.2 Small-angle bending

Work in ((x,y)) with transport nominally along (x), and let (n(y)=n_0+\epsilon, \nu(y)), (|\epsilon|\ll1), (\nu'=\tfrac{dn}{dy}). Geometrical-optics gives the **ray equation**
[
\frac{d}{ds}!\left(n,\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{ds}\right)=\nabla n,
\tag{B.7}
]
with arc-length (s) in the background metric. Projected transversely and linearized,
[
\frac{d^2 y}{ds^2} ;\approx; \frac{1}{n_0},\partial_y n ;=; \frac{\epsilon}{n_0},\nu'(y).
\tag{B.8}
]
Integrating once gives the **deflection angle** (\theta\simeq dy/ds):
[
\boxed{;\Delta\theta ;\approx; \frac{1}{n_0},\int_{s_1}^{s_2}\partial_\perp n,ds
;\propto; \int_{s_1}^{s_2}\partial_\perp U\big(\Gamma\big),ds;},
\tag{B.9}
]
with (\partial_\perp) the gradient transverse to the ray. Thus, **gradients of (\Gamma)** (through (U(\Gamma))) produce **predictable weak bending** of coherence geodesics. This is the transport analogue of GRIN-optics deflection and underwrites the focusing/caustic logic in the main text.

### B.4.3 Focusing and the Jacobi scalar

For a narrow bundle with separation (\eta) orthogonal to the reference ray, the Jacobi equation reduces to
[
\frac{d^2\eta}{ds^2};+;\mathcal{K}(s),\eta ;=; 0,\qquad
\mathcal{K}(s) ;\equiv; \text{sectional curvature of }(\mathcal{M},\tilde g)\text{ on the ray–normal 2-plane}.
\tag{B.10}
]
To leading order in the weak-gradient limit,
[
\mathcal{K}(s);\simeq; -,\frac{1}{n_0},\partial_\perp^2 n ;\propto; -,\partial_\perp^2 U\big(\Gamma\big),
\tag{B.11}
]
so **positive** (\partial_\perp^2 U) (a **convex** pressure penalty) yields **focusing** ((\mathcal{K}<0) in this convention → convergence), while **negative** curvature defocuses. Detecting sign-stable (\mathcal{K}) over a finite interval predicts a **conjugate point** (bundle cross-section zero) at a calculable distance.

---

## B.5 Where (\Gamma) enters (\tilde g)

The formulas above assume a mild structure. In full generality, (\Gamma) affects (\tilde g) through any (\dot q)-dependence in (V_\Gamma) (e.g., detuning penalties) and through the (q)-dependence of (K_\tau) (cycle-dependent inertia). For example, with
[
K_\tau=\tfrac12,\dot q^\top M(q;\Gamma),\dot q,\qquad
V_\Gamma=U(\Gamma;q)+\tfrac12,\dot q^\top D(q;\Gamma),\dot q,
\tag{B.12}
]
we obtain
[
\tilde g_{ij}=(M_{ij}-D_{ij})\Big|*{q*\star,\Gamma},\quad
\tilde\Gamma^i{}*{jk}=\tfrac12,\tilde g^{i\ell}(\partial_j\tilde g*{k\ell}+\partial_k\tilde g_{j\ell}-\partial_\ell\tilde g_{jk}),
\tag{B.13}
]
and the **curvature** (\tilde R) inherits spatial/temporal **structure from (\Gamma)** via (M, D). This is the most direct route to **curvature spikes** when (U) (or (D)) becomes locally sharp as the system approaches a lock failure.

---

## B.6 Worked toy model (for code & sanity checks)

Take (q=(x,y)), (K_\tau=\tfrac12(\dot x^2+\dot y^2)), (U(\Gamma)=\frac{\alpha}{2},\Gamma^2) with (\Gamma(y)=\Gamma_0+\beta y) (weak linear gradient). Then
[
\tilde g_{ij}=\delta_{ij},\qquad n(y)\propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{E_{\text{coh}}+\frac{\alpha}{2}(\Gamma_0+\beta y)^2}},
]
and for (|\beta y|\ll |\Gamma_0|), expand to first order: (n(y)\approx n_0 - \frac{\alpha \Gamma_0 \beta}{(2E_{\text{coh}}+\alpha\Gamma_0^2)^{3/2}},y). Hence
[
\Delta\theta \approx \frac{1}{n_0}\int \partial_y n,ds ;\sim; -,C,\beta,L,
]
with (C>0) a constant depending on (\alpha,\Gamma_0,E_{\text{coh}}) and path length (L). This gives a one-line **regression target** for lab or simulation ray-tracing: deflection scales linearly with the **(\Gamma) gradient** and path length.

---

## B.7 Practical checklist (what the referee can reproduce)

1. **Estimate (\tilde g)** on an extremal (fit (\partial^2\mathcal{L}_p/\partial\dot q^2)).
2. **Compute (\tilde\Gamma, \tilde R)** along the path; solve (B.4) for a few orthogonal (\eta) to get bundle behavior.
3. **Weak-gradient test:** verify (B.9) small-angle scaling in engineered or synthetic (\nabla\Gamma) fields.
4. **Spike detection:** locate intervals where proxies of (\mathcal{K}) (or discrete curvatures) peak; check for **conjugate-like** events (bundle area minima) near reported transitions.

# Appendix C — Cycle Isometries, Lorentz Map, and Rapidity Composition

## C.1 Cycle metric and the invariant quadratic form

Let the intrinsic **cycle coordinate** be (u) (phase-time; (u\sim u+2\pi) for a closed cycle), and let (\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^d) be **transverse coordinates** in the local embedding where coherence transport is resolved. Along an extremal of the coherence action (App. A–B), the **second variation** defines an effective transport metric (\tilde g). In a local orthonormal frame adapted to the cycle we may write, to leading order,
[
ds_c^2 ;=; -,c_\tau^2,du^2 ;+; d\mathbf{x}\cdot d\mathbf{x},
\tag{C.1}
]
where (c_\tau>0) is the **characteristic cycle speed** (units: transverse/phase). This is the canonical quadratic form preserved by the **cycle isometry group**. In (1{+}1) (one transverse axis (x)), the isometry group is (O(1,1)); in (1{+}d), it is (O(1,d)). We restrict to the identity component (SO^+(1,d)) (proper, orthochronous) for physical transport.

> **Interpretation.** Equation (C.1) is not Minkowski spacetime; it is the **transport metric of coherence** in the neighborhood of a locked trajectory. “Boosts” will mix (u) (cycle) and (\mathbf{x}) (transverse).

## C.2 Boosts as cycle–transverse isometries

In (1{+}1), a **boost** with rapidity (\phi) acts as
[
\begin{pmatrix}
c_\tau u'\ x'
\end{pmatrix}
=============

\begin{pmatrix}
\cosh\phi & -\sinh\phi\
-\sinh\phi & \cosh\phi
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
c_\tau u\ x
\end{pmatrix},
\qquad \phi\in\mathbb{R}.
\tag{C.2}
]
The quadratic form (C.1) is preserved: (-c_\tau^2 u'^2 + x'^2 = -c_\tau^2 u^2 + x^2). Define the **cycle-velocity parameter**
[
\beta ;\equiv; \frac{dx}{c_\tau,du},,\qquad \gamma \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}},,
\tag{C.3}
]
so that (\tanh\phi=\beta), (\cosh\phi=\gamma), (\sinh\phi=\gamma\beta). Composition is **additive in rapidity**:
[
\phi_{\rm tot} = \phi_2 + \phi_1
;;\Rightarrow;;
\beta_{\rm tot} = \frac{\beta_1 + \beta_2}{1 + \beta_1\beta_2}.
\tag{C.4}
]
In (1{+}d), boosts along a unit direction (\hat{\mathbf{n}}) act via the familiar block form
[
\begin{aligned}
c_\tau u' &= \gamma,(c_\tau u - \boldsymbol{\beta}!\cdot!\mathbf{x}),\
\mathbf{x}'*\parallel &= \gamma,(\mathbf{x}*\parallel - \boldsymbol{\beta},c_\tau u),\
\mathbf{x}'*\perp &= \mathbf{x}*\perp,
\end{aligned}
\qquad \boldsymbol{\beta}=\beta,\hat{\mathbf{n}},;; \mathbf{x}_\parallel=(\mathbf{x}!\cdot!\hat{\mathbf{n}})\hat{\mathbf{n}}.
\tag{C.5}
]
Again (ds_c^2) is invariant.

## C.3 Null directions and the transport cone

Null directions of (C.1) satisfy (d\mathbf{x}\cdot d\mathbf{x}=c_\tau^2,du^2). They define the **transport cone** for coherence signals: trajectories with (|\beta|=1) ((d\mathbf{x}=\pm c_\tau,du)) are null; (|\beta|<1) are timelike (cycle-dominated); (|\beta|>1) are spacelike (forbidden as geodesics in the local transport geometry). This underwrites the **causal structure** for coherence propagation: boosts preserve the cone.

## C.4 Frequency and phase dilation

Let (\omega_\tau \equiv du/dt) be the **cycle frequency** with respect to laboratory time (t), and let (k_x \equiv dx/dt). Then (\beta = k_x/(c_\tau\omega_\tau)). Under a boost with rapidity (\phi),
[
\omega_\tau'=\gamma\left(\omega_\tau - \frac{\beta}{c_\tau^2},k_x\right),\qquad
k_x'=\gamma\left(k_x - \beta,\omega_\tau\right).
\tag{C.6}
]
Define a **phase 4-vector** (p^\mu=(\omega_\tau,,\mathbf{k}/c_\tau)) (units chosen so (c_\tau) plays the role of a limiting speed). Then (p_\mu p^\mu = \omega_\tau^2 - |\mathbf{k}|^2/c_\tau^2) is invariant; constant (p_\mu p^\mu) surfaces are preserved by boosts, giving a concise way to test isometry empirically.

## C.5 Noether currents for isometries

By App. A, continuous symmetries of the coherence action yield **conserved currents**:

* **Time translation (lab clock)** (\Rightarrow) coherence energy (\mathcal{H}_p).
* **Global cycle shift** (\vartheta\mapsto\vartheta+\epsilon) (\Rightarrow) cycle charge (Q_{\rm cyc}).
* **Cycle–transverse isometries** (boost/rotation generators (K_i,J_{ij})) (\Rightarrow) currents (J[K_i], J[J_{ij}]) satisfying the (so(1,d)) algebra at the level of Poisson brackets (or commutators in quantized models).

Explicitly, with coordinates (X^\mu=(c_\tau u,\mathbf{x})) and conjugate momenta (\Pi_\mu=\partial \mathcal{L}*p/\partial \dot X^\mu), the **boost current** along (\hat{\mathbf{n}}) is
[
J[K*{\hat{\mathbf{n}}}] ;=; X_\parallel,\Pi_0 - X_0,\Pi_\parallel,
\tag{C.7}
]
and **rotation currents** are (J[J_{ij}]=X_i\Pi_j-X_j\Pi_i). Conservation follows when (\mathcal{L}_p) depends on (X^\mu) only via (ds_c^2) and when boundary terms vanish.

## C.6 Empirical test: isometry, not reparameterization

A coordinate rescaling can **fake** invariance in a single equation. To establish genuine symmetry:

1. **Interval invariance.** Reconstruct the local metric (\tilde g) (App. B) and verify constancy of (ds_c^2) across transformed trajectories within uncertainty.
2. **Group composition.** Fit boosts between three conditions (\mathcal{C}*0\to\mathcal{C}*1\to\mathcal{C}*2). Extract rapidities (\phi*{01},\phi*{12}); predict (\phi*{02}=\phi_{12}+\phi_{01}). Compare to the directly fitted (\phi_{02}).
3. **Velocity addition.** From (C.4), test (\beta_{\rm tot}=(\beta_1+\beta_2)/(1+\beta_1\beta_2)) on inferred cycle-velocities for independent manipulations (e.g., detuning and load).
4. **Current conservation.** Estimate (J[K_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}}]) with bootstrap CIs; verify constancy along geodesics under the same manipulations.

Failure of (2–3) with success at (1) indicates **parametrization invariance**, not a group isometry; failure of (1) rules out the quadratic form itself.

## C.7 Anisotropy and the emergent-Lorentz limit

Real systems may start with **anisotropic** cycle inertia:
[
ds_c^2 = -c_\tau^2 du^2 + \mathbf{dx}^\top \mathbf{A},\mathbf{dx},\quad \mathbf{A}=\mathrm{diag}(a_1,\dots,a_d).
\tag{C.8}
]
Under coarse-graining, many-body flows can approach an **emergent Lorentz** fixed point where (\mathbf{A}\to \mathbb{1}) and a single (c_\tau) dominates. Define anisotropy ( \Delta = \max_i |a_i-1| ). A practical criterion for “near-Lorentz” is ( \Delta < \varepsilon ) with (\varepsilon) fixed by experimental resolution; boosts are then well-approximated by (C.5). Deviations scale with (\Delta) and can be bounded empirically; report ( (\varepsilon,\Delta)) with boost-test results.

## C.8 Worked toy model (closed form)

Take (1{+}1) and a control parameter (\lambda) (e.g., detuning) that changes the **cycle-velocity** from (\beta_1) to (\beta_2) via small shifts (\delta\beta). The **measured** mapping between states (\mathcal{C}*1) and (\mathcal{C}*2) yields
[
\phi*{12} = \tanh^{-1}\beta_2 - \tanh^{-1}\beta_1 \approx \frac{\delta\beta}{1-\beta^2},,
\tag{C.9}
]
with (\beta) evaluated at the midpoint. For three settings ((\lambda_0,\lambda_1,\lambda_2)), verify
[
\phi*{02}\stackrel{?}{=}\phi_{12}+\phi_{01}\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\beta_{02}\stackrel{?}{=}\frac{\beta_{01}+\beta_{12}}{1+\beta_{01}\beta_{12}}.
\tag{C.10}
]
This pair (additivity in (\phi), velocity addition in (\beta)) is a **smoking gun** for genuine Lorentz-type isometries of the cycle metric.

## C.9 What to report (referee checklist)

* Estimated (c_\tau) and local (\tilde g) with uncertainties; goodness of fit for (C.1).
* Triples of conditions/testing manipulations; fitted (\phi)’s and **composition residual** (\Delta\phi=\phi_{02}-(\phi_{12}+\phi_{01})).
* Velocity-addition residual ( \Delta\beta = \beta_{02}-\frac{\beta_{01}+\beta_{12}}{1+\beta_{01}\beta_{12}}).
* Currents (J[K_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}}], J[J_{ij}]) with CIs along geodesics.
* Anisotropy bound (\Delta) (Eq. C.8) and whether results fall in the emergent-Lorentz regime.

# Appendix D — Fibered Rephasings, Gauge Connection, and Minimal Coupling

## D.1 Pattern field and global symmetry

Let the **pattern field** be a complex vector (\psi(t,\mathbf{x})\in \mathbb{C}^m) (or a real multiplet) carrying the resonant degrees of freedom (the “Ki” content). Equip the fiber with an inner product (h(\cdot,\cdot)) (Hermitian for complex fields). Suppose (\mathcal{L}_p) is invariant under a **global** action of a compact Lie group (G) with unitary representation (U\in {\rm Rep}(G)):
[
\psi ;\mapsto; U,\psi,\qquad U=\exp!\big(\epsilon^a T_a\big),\quad T_a^\dagger=-T_a.
\tag{D.1}
]
By Noether (App. A), global symmetry yields conserved internal currents (J^a).

## D.2 Localizing the symmetry ⇒ connection and covariant derivative

Promote (U) to a **local** map (U(t,\mathbf{x})). Plain derivatives then fail to transform covariantly:
[
\partial_\mu \psi ;\mapsto; U,\partial_\mu \psi + (\partial_\mu U),\psi.
]
Introduce a **connection one-form** (A_\mu = A_\mu^a T_a) so that the **covariant derivative**
[
D_\mu \psi ;\equiv; \partial_\mu \psi + A_\mu \psi
\tag{D.2}
]
transforms **homogeneously**:
[
A_\mu ;\mapsto; U A_\mu U^{-1} - (\partial_\mu U) U^{-1}, \qquad D_\mu \psi ;\mapsto; U,D_\mu\psi.
\tag{D.3}
]
This is precisely the condition that (A_\mu) is a **connection** on a principal (G)-bundle and (D) is the induced covariant derivative on the associated vector bundle.

## D.3 Curvature and Bianchi identity

Define the **curvature (field strength)** as the commutator of covariant derivatives:
[
F_{\mu\nu} ;\equiv; [D_\mu, D_\nu] ;=; \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu + [A_\mu, A_\nu]
;=; F_{\mu\nu}^a T_a.
\tag{D.4}
]
Under a gauge transformation, (F_{\mu\nu}\mapsto U F_{\mu\nu} U^{-1}). The structure constants (f_{ab}{}^{c}) of (\mathfrak{g}=\mathrm{Lie}(G)) appear via ([T_a,T_b]=f_{ab}{}^{c}T_c). The **Bianchi identity** is
[
D_{[\mu}F_{\nu\rho]}=0,
\tag{D.5}
]
a purely geometric constraint on the curvature (cyclic sum over (\mu,\nu,\rho)).

## D.4 Minimal coupling in the coherence action

The **coherence Lagrangian** (App. A) becomes gauge-covariant by the usual **minimal substitution** (\partial \to D). In its simplest local form (sufficient near a locked orbit) we write
[
\mathcal{L}*p ;=; K*\tau - V_\Gamma ;;\leadsto;;
\boxed{;\mathcal{L}^{\rm (g)}*p ;=; K*\tau!\big(\psi, D\psi; \vartheta\big) ;-; V_\Gamma!\big(\Gamma;\psi\big) ;-; \frac{1}{4g^2}, \mathrm{tr},F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu};}
\tag{D.6}
]
where:

* (K_\tau) increases with **temporal coherence** and now depends on (D\psi) instead of (\partial\psi);
* (V_\Gamma) is the **pressure-load** (may include gauge-invariant (\psi^\dagger\psi) or symmetry-breaking terms if desired);
* the last term is the **Yang–Mills** kinetic energy with coupling (g), using (\mathrm{tr}) in the representation.

Two common choices:

1. **Quadratic kinetic** (K_\tau = \tfrac12 (D_\mu \psi)^\dagger , \mathbb{M}^{\mu\nu} , (D_\nu\psi)) with a positive matrix (\mathbb{M}^{\mu\nu}) set by the transport metric (App. B).
2. **Nonlinear sigma-type** (K_\tau = f(\psi^\dagger\psi), (D_\mu\psi)^\dagger (D^\mu\psi)) for amplitude-dependent inertia.

Either way, the **second variation** w.r.t. velocities defines the effective transport metric (\tilde g) used in Appendices B–C.

## D.5 Euler–Lagrange equations: Yang–Mills + matter

Varying (\mathcal{L}^{\rm (g)}*p) gives the coupled equations:
[
\begin{aligned}
&\textbf{Matter:}\quad D*\mu!\left(\frac{\partial K_\tau}{\partial (D_\mu\psi)}\right) - \frac{\partial K_\tau}{\partial \psi} + \frac{\partial V_\Gamma}{\partial \psi} = 0,[2pt]
&\textbf{Gauge:}\quad \frac{1}{g^2}, D_\mu F^{\mu\nu} ;=; J^\nu, \qquad
J^\nu \equiv -,\frac{\partial K_\tau}{\partial A_\nu}\Big|*{\psi,D\psi};=;\left(\frac{\partial K*\tau}{\partial (D_\nu\psi)}\right)\psi^{\dagger} + \text{h.c.} ;+; \cdots
\end{aligned}
\tag{D.7}
]
The dots allow for additional gauge-invariant structures in (K_\tau). The **covariant current conservation** (D_\nu J^\nu=0) follows from gauge invariance and the matter equation of motion (Noether’s second theorem in this setting).

## D.6 Holonomy and Wilson loops (global tests)

The **parallel transport** around a closed loop (C) in the base space produces the **holonomy**
[
\mathcal{U}(C) ;=; \mathcal{P}\exp!\left(\oint_C A_\mu,dx^\mu\right) ;\in; G,
\tag{D.8}
]
with (\mathcal{P}) denoting path ordering. Its **class function**
[
W(C) ;\equiv; \frac{1}{\dim {\cal R}}\mathrm{tr}_{\cal R},\mathcal{U}(C)
\tag{D.9}
]
is the **Wilson loop** in representation (\mathcal{R}). A nontrivial holonomy ((W(C)\neq 1)) detects **curvature integrated over the loop’s interior** (non-Abelian Stokes theorem). Operationally, holonomy differentiates **true gauge structure** from mere reparameterizations: if all loops yield trivial holonomy within experimental precision, the effective connection is **pure gauge** in the probed region.

## D.7 Gauge fixing, residual symmetries, and observables

To compute or fit (A_\mu) one often fixes a **gauge** (e.g., temporal (A_0=0), Coulomb (\nabla!\cdot!\mathbf{A}=0), or Lorenz (\partial_\mu A^\mu=0)). Physical observables must be **gauge-invariant**:

* **Local**: polynomials in (\psi^\dagger\psi), (\mathrm{tr},F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}), etc.
* **Nonlocal**: **Wilson loops**, **parallel-transport phase** of (\psi) around loops, **Berry-like** phases for adiabatic cycles in parameter space.

In the transport picture, a decisive signature is **loop-dependent phase transport** that cannot be removed by any single choice of gauge across the region of interest.

## D.8 Discrete (graph) analogue for experiments

On a **dynamic graph** (G=(V,E)) (e.g., electrode network, functional connectivity), model gauge transport by assigning to each **oriented edge** (e=(u\to v)) a group element (U_e \in G) (the discrete parallel transporter). Then:

* **Covariant difference** on edge (e): (D_e\psi \equiv \psi(v) - U_e \psi(u)).
* **Plaquette holonomy** around a face (\square): ( \mathcal{U}*\square = \prod*{e\in \partial\square} U_e ) (with orientation).
* **Discrete curvature**: deviation of (\mathcal{U}_\square) from identity.

A gauge transformation is a node assignment (G_v) acting as (\psi(v)\mapsto G_v\psi(v)), (U_{u\to v}\mapsto G_v U_{u\to v} G_u^{-1}). Fit (U_e) from data by minimizing a **graph-coherence action**
[
\mathcal{S}^{\rm (g)}*{\rm graph} = \sum*{e} w_e ,|D_e\psi|^2 ;+; \lambda \sum_{\square} w_\square , \big(1 - \tfrac{1}{\dim{\cal R}}\mathrm{tr},\mathcal{U}_\square\big),
\tag{D.10}
]
then test for **nontrivial holonomy** on plaquettes (genuine curvature) versus pure-gauge fits.

## D.9 Coupling to the transport metric (\tilde g)

Appendix B endowed the cycle manifold with an effective metric (\tilde g). The natural gauge-invariant kinetic term is
[
K_\tau = \tfrac12, \tilde g^{\mu\nu}, (D_\mu\psi)^\dagger (D_\nu\psi),
\tag{D.11}
]
linking **fiber geometry** (connection (A)) to **base transport geometry** ((\tilde g)). The second variation of (D.11) contributes to (\tilde g) through (\psi)’s inertia, while the gauge kinetic (\mathrm{tr},F^2) is a base scalar—cleanly separable in fits.

## D.10 Symmetry breaking and mass generation (optional box)

If the potential (V_\Gamma) favors a nonzero vacuum amplitude (\langle \psi\rangle\neq 0) that **breaks** (G\to H), the connection decomposes into **massive** (broken) and **massless** (unbroken) components. In unitary gauge, the massive gauge fields obtain a mass matrix (M^2\propto \langle \psi\rangle^\dagger T_a T_b \langle\psi\rangle). This reproduces the familiar **Higgs-like** mechanism in the coherence setting (App. E will relate masses to **stiffness** (\kappa_\Gamma)).

## D.11 Empirical tests (what to actually do)

1. **Local covariance:** Show that replacing (\partial \to D) restores invariance of your fitted dynamics under *local* rephasings; report residuals under gauge changes.
2. **Holonomy detection:** Design loops in control space (or physical space/time) and measure loop-dependent parallel-transport phases; fit (W(C)). Nontrivial, reproducible values imply true curvature.
3. **Current sourcing:** Estimate the internal Noether currents (J^a) and verify they source the fitted connection via (D.7).
4. **Discrete plaquettes:** On graphs, fit edge transporters (U_e) and report the distribution of (\mathrm{tr},\mathcal{U}_\square); nontrivial plaquettes diagnose curvature even when local fits look reparametrization-equivalent.
5. **Minimality check:** Compare data likelihood (or cross-validated error) for (i) plain derivatives vs. (ii) covariant derivatives with the **fewest** added dof. Prefer the smallest (G) that passes holonomy tests.

# Appendix E — Linearization about Lock, Spectral Gap from (\kappa_\Gamma), and the Higgs Limit

## E.1 Locked trajectory and perturbation variables

Let (q_\star(t)) be a **locked** (periodic) extremal of the coherence action (\mathcal{S}*p=\int (K*\tau - V_\Gamma),dt) with period (\tau_p) and intrinsic phase (\vartheta=t/\tau_p\cdot 2\pi). Write small perturbations
[
q(t)=q_\star(t)+\xi(t),\qquad \Gamma(t,\mathbf{x})=\Gamma_\star+\delta\Gamma(t,\mathbf{x}) ,
]
and (when needed) slow amplitude/phase perturbations of a pattern field (\psi=\psi_\star+\delta\psi).
We expand the Lagrangian to quadratic order in ((\xi,\dot\xi,\delta\Gamma,\partial\delta\Gamma)).

**Assumption (regular lock).** On-cycle, the quadratic form in velocities is positive definite (Legendre condition), so the **transport metric** (\tilde g) exists (App. B).

---

## E.2 Quadratic Lagrangian and normal modes

Locally (drop total derivatives), write the quadratic piece as
[
\mathcal{L}^{(2)}=\tfrac12,\dot\xi^\top \mathbf{M},\dot\xi
-\tfrac12,\xi^\top \mathbf{H},\xi
-\tfrac12 ,\delta\Gamma,\kappa_\Gamma,\delta\Gamma
+\tfrac12,(\partial\delta\Gamma)^\top!\mathbf{C},(\partial\delta\Gamma)
+\dot\xi^\top \mathbf{B},\xi ;+; \text{mixing terms},
\tag{E.1}
]
where:

* (\mathbf{M}=\partial^2 K_\tau/\partial\dot q^2|_\star) (positive definite inertia),
* (\mathbf{H}=-\partial^2 K_\tau/\partial q^2|*\star + \partial^2 V*\Gamma/\partial q^2|_\star),
* (\kappa_\Gamma \equiv \partial^2 V_\Gamma/\partial \Gamma^2|_\star) (the **stiffness**),
* (\mathbf{C}) collects gradient penalties for (\delta\Gamma),
* (\mathbf{B}) is the usual gyroscopic/skew term from mixed (q,\dot q) derivatives,
* “mixing terms” include (\delta\Gamma,\xi) and (\delta\Gamma,\dot\xi) couplings.

Diagonalize the ((\xi,\delta\Gamma)) system by a standard **block Schur complement** or by completing the square. Two generic outcomes:

1. **Heavy (\Gamma) sector** ((\kappa_\Gamma) large): integrate out (\delta\Gamma) to get an **effective potential** for (\xi).
2. **Light (\Gamma) sector**: keep coupled modes; the algebra below still shows how gaps arise.

For clarity, take case (1) first.

---

## E.3 Effective (\xi)-sector and the gap

Completing the square in (\delta\Gamma) yields
[
\mathcal{L}^{(2)} ;\Rightarrow; \tfrac12,\dot\xi^\top \mathbf{M},\dot\xi
-\tfrac12,\xi^\top \big(\mathbf{H}-\mathbf{K}\big),\xi + \tfrac12,(\partial\delta\Gamma)^\top \mathbf{C},(\partial\delta\Gamma)\Big|*{\text{on-shell}},
\tag{E.2}
]
where (\mathbf{K}) is positive semidefinite and scales like ( \propto \frac{(\partial^2 V*\Gamma/\partial \Gamma \partial q)^\top(\partial^2 V_\Gamma/\partial \Gamma \partial q)}{\kappa_\Gamma}) (from the Schur complement). Thus, **larger stiffness** (\kappa_\Gamma) pushes the effective “spring” (\mathbf{H}-\mathbf{K}) **upward**.

Seeking normal modes (\xi(t)\sim e^{-i\omega t} u) gives the **generalized eigenproblem**
[
\det!\Big[,\omega^2 \mathbf{M} - \big(\mathbf{H}-\mathbf{K}\big),\Big]=0.
\tag{E.3}
]
If (\mathbf{M}) and (\mathbf{H}-\mathbf{K}) commute (or after simultaneous diagonalization by (\mathbf{M}^{-1/2})), each mode (u_a) satisfies
[
\omega_a^2 ;=; \omega_{0,a}^2 ;+; c_a,\kappa_\Gamma ;+; \mathcal{O}(\kappa_\Gamma^0,\kappa_\Gamma^{-1}),
\tag{E.4}
]
with (\omega_{0,a}^2) the “bare” (stiffness-free) curvature of the on-cycle potential and (c_a\ge 0) calculable from the block structure. **Conclusion:** a **spectral gap** opens as
[
\boxed{;\omega_a(\kappa_\Gamma);\simeq; \sqrt{\omega_{0,a}^2 + c_a,\kappa_\Gamma};}
\tag{E.5}
]
—this is the coherence-transport analogue of a mass term.

> If the (\Gamma)-sector is light, the coupled quadratic form yields two branches with an avoided crossing; to leading order the **sum of squared frequencies** still increases linearly with (\kappa_\Gamma), and each branch acquires a positive shift unless tuned mixings cancel it.

---

## E.4 Dispersion and “effective mass”

For spatially extended systems, Fourier-expand (\xi(t,\mathbf{x})\propto e^{-i\omega t + i\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{x}}). With a local, isotropic transport metric (\tilde g) (App. B) the quadratic form yields
[
\omega^2(\mathbf{k}) ;=; v_a^2,|\mathbf{k}|^2 ;+; m_a^2,\qquad m_a^2 \equiv c_a,\kappa_\Gamma + \omega_{0,a}^2,
\tag{E.6}
]
where (v_a) is the mode’s group speed in the (\kappa_\Gamma\to 0) limit. Thus the **effective mass** of mode (a) is
[
\boxed{,m_a(\kappa_\Gamma)=\sqrt{m_{0,a}^2 + c_a,\kappa_\Gamma},},,\qquad m_{0,a}\equiv \omega_{0,a}.
\tag{E.7}
]
This is the precise sense in which **stiffness generates gaps** for transport modes.

---

## E.5 The **Higgs limit** and the SM map

Consider a sector where the load (V_\Gamma) contains (or reduces to) a scalar potential (U(\Phi)) with a vacuum expectation value (v), and matter fields couple via gauge- and Yukawa-like terms (App. D). Near the minimum,
[
U(\Phi);\approx; U(v) + \tfrac12,U''(v),(\delta\Phi)^2 + \cdots,
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\kappa_\Gamma ;\propto; U''(v).
\tag{E.8}
]
Identifying (\kappa_\Gamma) with the **curvature of the scalar potential** at the vacuum gives the **Higgs limit**:
[
m_W, m_Z, m_f ;;\text{reproduced by};; \kappa_\Gamma \mapsto U''(v),\ \text{with the usual gauge/Yukawa couplings.}
\tag{E.9}
]
**Beyond** that limit—i.e., when (V_\Gamma) retains residual stiffness not captured by the pure scalar curvature or when detuning-penalties add quadratic terms—the transport modes acquire **additional, correlated** shifts:
[
m_a^2 ;=; m_{a,\text{SM}}^2 ;+; \delta m_a^2,\qquad \delta m_a^2 = c_a,\Delta\kappa_\Gamma + \sum_b \epsilon_{ab},\Delta\kappa_{\Gamma,b},
\tag{E.10}
]
with (\Delta\kappa_\Gamma) parameterizing stiffness beyond the SM potential and (\epsilon_{ab}) encoding mixings. The key feature is **correlation**: the **same** (\Delta\kappa_\Gamma) shifts **multiple** masses with **fixed ratios** (\delta m_a^2/\delta m_b^2 \simeq c_a/c_b) at leading order.

---

## E.6 What is universal and what is model-dependent?

* **Universal:** Existence of a **gap** that grows with (\kappa_\Gamma); linear scaling in (m^2) to first order; correlated shifts across modes sharing the same stiffness source.
* **Model-dependent:** The coefficients (c_a), the mixings (\epsilon_{ab}), and whether (\Gamma) is heavy or light relative to the pattern modes.

This separation is important for **falsifiability**: experiments need not pin every coefficient to refute the **universal** scaling/correlation structure.

---

## E.7 Minimal empirical recipe (how a referee can test it)

1. **Fit dispersion** (\omega^2(\mathbf{k}) = v_a^2 k^2 + m_a^2) in a controlled system (lab analogue or simulation).
2. **Vary stiffness** via a knob that sharpens (V_\Gamma) (e.g., detuning variance, external drive amplitude, pressure-like control).
3. **Check scaling:** regress (m_a^2) vs. the knob; look for linear trends consistent with (m_a^2 = m_{0,a}^2 + c_a \kappa_\Gamma).
4. **Cross-channel correlation:** verify that multiple modes shift with fixed **ratios** within error bars—hallmark of a **single** stiffness parameter.

---

## E.8 Toy model (closed form; code-ready)

Take (q=(x,y)), with
[
K_\tau=\tfrac12(\dot x^2+\dot y^2), \quad
V_\Gamma = U(\Gamma)+\tfrac{\alpha}{2} \Gamma^2 (x^2+y^2),\quad
U(\Gamma)=\tfrac12,\kappa_\Gamma,(\Gamma-\Gamma_\star)^2.
\tag{E.11}
]
Linearize around ((x,y)=(0,0)), (\Gamma=\Gamma_\star). The quadratic Lagrangian becomes
[
\mathcal{L}^{(2)}=\tfrac12(\dot x^2+\dot y^2)-\tfrac12,\alpha \Gamma_\star^2(x^2+y^2)
-\tfrac12,\kappa_\Gamma(\delta\Gamma)^2 + \tfrac12 c_\Gamma,(\partial\delta\Gamma)^2 + \alpha \Gamma_\star,\delta\Gamma,(x^2+y^2)/2.
\tag{E.12}
]
Integrating out (\delta\Gamma) to leading order adds (\propto (\alpha \Gamma_\star)^2,\kappa_\Gamma^{-1}(x^2+y^2)), i.e.
[
m^2 = \alpha \Gamma_\star^2 ;+; \frac{(\alpha \Gamma_\star)^2}{\kappa_\Gamma};\times;(\text{constant});+;\cdots,
\tag{E.13}
]
showing explicitly how **increasing** (\kappa_\Gamma) hardens the mode (when the sign structure is standard; with opposite sign conventions, the linear term is (+c,\kappa_\Gamma)). Either way, the **slope** of (m^2) in the stiffness knob is calculable and shared by degenerate modes (x,y) (correlation).

---

## E.9 Interface to phenomenology

* **Collider-facing:** identify which **effective modes** map to measured masses (e.g., heavy-vector, heavy-flavor channels). The prediction is **correlated** mass/width shifts governed by a **single** (\Delta\kappa_\Gamma) at leading order.
* **Cosmology-facing:** homogeneous offsets of (V_\Gamma) contribute to (\Lambda_{\rm eff}) (Sec. 5, App. G); the same stiffness that opens gaps locally must be consistent with the (tiny) large-scale value.
* **Analogue systems:** waveguide arrays, metamaterials, or oscillator networks can implement a tunable (\kappa_\Gamma). Look for **gap opening** and **group-velocity** changes per (E.6).

---

## E.10 What would falsify this appendix’s claims?

* **No linear regime:** If (m_a^2) vs. the stiffness knob refuses a linear window (or shows inconsistent slopes across repetitions), the universal scaling is false.
* **No correlation:** If two modes expected to share the same (\Delta\kappa_\Gamma) move with **unrelated** slopes, a single-parameter stiffness picture fails.
* **Higgs-limit mismatch:** In sectors where the scalar-curvature map is unambiguous, failure to recover known masses in the appropriate limit undermines the correspondence.

# Appendix F — Lepton (g!-!2) Phenomenology: One-Parameter Fit, Forecast, and Falsifiers

## F.1 Observable definitions and baselines

Let (a_\ell \equiv (g_\ell-2)/2), (\ell\in{e,\mu,\tau}). Write
[
a_\ell^{\rm obs} ;=; a_\ell^{\rm SM}(\theta_{\rm SM}) ;+; \Delta a_\ell(\eta) ;,
\tag{F.1}
]
where (a_\ell^{\rm SM}) is the Standard Model (SM) prediction (with its own nuisance parameters (\theta_{\rm SM}), e.g., (\alpha) choice for (e), HVP/HLbL inputs for (\mu)), and (\Delta a_\ell) is the **coherence-pressure** correction.

We consider **two** electron baselines (choice of (\alpha)) and **multiple** muon baselines (dispersive vs lattice-informed HVP). The framework **does not** pick among them; it conditions on whichever baseline you specify and reports sensitivity to baseline switches (Sec. F.7).

## F.2 Single-parameter law and scaling basis

Model the beyond-SM term as
[
\boxed{;\Delta a_\ell(\eta);=;\eta,\Xi_\ell;,}
\tag{F.2}
]
with a **single real parameter** (\eta) and a lepton-specific **structure factor** (\Xi_\ell) that encodes the wound-channel/resonance geometry. To make the analysis reproducible and neutral, represent (\Xi_\ell) in a minimal **scaling basis**:
[
\Xi_\ell ;=; \sum_{r=0}^{R} c_r ,\bigg(\frac{m_\ell}{m_\mu}\bigg)^{p_r},
\qquad p_r \in {0,1,2},
\tag{F.3}
]
with (c_r) fixed by **priors** (below) so that (\Xi_e \ll \Xi_\mu \lesssim \Xi_\tau) emerges without overfitting. The default **locked** choice is (R=1) with (p_0=1) and (c_0=1) (pure linear mass scaling) so that (\Xi_\ell = (m_\ell/m_\mu)); you can open (R=2) with ({p_0=1,p_1=2}) if residuals demand curvature.

> Practical stance: start with (\Xi_\ell=(m_\ell/m_\mu)). If the electron fit explodes, expand to ({1,2}) and penalize (c_1) with a tight prior.

## F.3 Data vector, covariances, and likelihood

Collect the (baseline-dependent) **residual** vector
[
\mathbf{r}(\eta);=;\begin{bmatrix}
a_e^{\rm obs} - a_e^{\rm SM} - \eta,\Xi_e[4pt]
a_\mu^{\rm obs} - a_\mu^{\rm SM} - \eta,\Xi_\mu
\end{bmatrix},\qquad
\mathbf{\Sigma} = \mathbf{\Sigma}*{\rm exp} \oplus \mathbf{\Sigma}*{\rm th},
\tag{F.4}
]
where (\mathbf{\Sigma}*{\rm exp}) is experimental covariance (often diagonal to excellent approximation) and (\mathbf{\Sigma}*{\rm th}) is the SM-theory covariance (include electron’s (\alpha) choice as a discrete branch; include correlated HVP components for (\mu) if provided). The **Gaussian** log-likelihood is
[
-2\ln \mathcal{L}(\eta) ;=; \mathbf{r}(\eta)^\top \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}\mathbf{r}(\eta) ;+; \text{const}.
\tag{F.5}
]

Because the model is **linear** in (\eta), the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) has a closed form:
[
\hat\eta ;=; \frac{\boldsymbol{\Xi}^\top \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1},\mathbf{d}}{\boldsymbol{\Xi}^\top \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1},\boldsymbol{\Xi}},
\quad
\sigma_\eta^2 ;=; \frac{1}{\boldsymbol{\Xi}^\top \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1},\boldsymbol{\Xi}},
\tag{F.6}
]
where (\boldsymbol{\Xi} \equiv (\Xi_e, \Xi_\mu)^\top) and (\mathbf{d}\equiv (a_e^{\rm obs}-a_e^{\rm SM},,a_\mu^{\rm obs}-a_\mu^{\rm SM})^\top).

**One-line falsifier:** if (|\hat\eta|/\sigma_\eta \ll 1) *and* the (\tau) forecast (below) is unmeasurably tiny, the one-parameter extension adds no explanatory power (prefer the null).

## F.4 Posterior & Bayes factor (optional Bayesian dressing)

Take a weakly informative prior (\eta\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_\eta^{\rm prior,2})) with (\sigma_\eta^{\rm prior}) broad relative to the MLE error. The posterior is Gaussian:
[
\eta \mid \text{data}; \sim; \mathcal{N}!\left(\mu_\eta,\ \sigma_{\eta|}^2\right),\qquad
\sigma_{\eta|}^{-2} = \sigma_\eta^{-2} + \sigma_\eta^{\rm prior, -2},\quad
\mu_\eta = \sigma_{\eta|}^2\left(\hat\eta/\sigma_\eta^2\right).
\tag{F.7}
]
For model comparison against the **null** ((\eta=0)), the Savage–Dickey density ratio yields a Bayes factor (B_{10} = \frac{p(\eta=0)}{p(\eta=0\mid \text{data})}) (closed form for Gaussians). Report both (B_{10}) and frequentist (\Delta\chi^2).

## F.5 Preregistered (\tau) forecast

Given (\eta) (MLE or posterior), the **predictive** for (\tau) is
[
a_\tau^{\rm pred} ;=; a_\tau^{\rm SM} ;+; \eta,\Xi_\tau,
\tag{F.8}
]
with uncertainty
[
\sigma^2(a_\tau^{\rm pred}) ;=; \sigma^2(a_\tau^{\rm SM}) ;+; \Xi_\tau^2,\sigma_{\eta|}^2 ;+; 2,\mathrm{Cov}!\left(a_\tau^{\rm SM},\eta\right),
\tag{F.9}
]
and (\mathrm{Cov}=0) if you treat (\eta) and the SM baseline as independent. **Pre-register** the central value, (1\sigma) and (2\sigma) bands, and the sign. If a new measurement lands **outside the (2\sigma) band**, the single-parameter law is falsified (holding baselines fixed).

## F.6 Sensitivity to baseline choices (alpha / HVP)

Run the pipeline under the discrete choices:

* **Electron:** ({,\alpha_{\rm Cs},;\alpha_{\rm Rb},}) (\Rightarrow) two (a_e^{\rm SM}) lines.
* **Muon:** ({,\text{HVP}*{\rm disp},;\text{HVP}*{\rm lat},}) (and updated HLbL when applicable).

Report a **2×2 table**:
[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
& \alpha_{\rm Cs} & \alpha_{\rm Rb}\\hline
\text{HVP}*{\rm disp} & (\hat\eta,\sigma*\eta,a_\tau^{\rm pred}\pm\sigma) & \cdots\
\text{HVP}_{\rm lat} & \cdots & \cdots
\end{array}
]
and the **spread** across cells. A robust (\eta) (sign/magnitude) **stable** under these switches strengthens the case; volatility argues the signal is baseline-driven.

## F.7 Two-basis extension (only if needed)

If residuals vs (\Xi_\ell\propto m_\ell) show structure, open the (p={1,2}) basis:
[
\Delta a_\ell = \eta_1 \Big(\frac{m_\ell}{m_\mu}\Big) + \eta_2 \Big(\frac{m_\ell}{m_\mu}\Big)^2.
\tag{F.10}
]
Fit (\boldsymbol{\eta}=(\eta_1,\eta_2)) with a **ridge prior** (\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},,\lambda^{-1}\mathbf{I})) to prevent overfitting the electron point. Forecast (\tau) with both parameters. Penalize model complexity explicitly (AIC/BIC or Bayes factor vs one-parameter). Only adopt the 2-basis if it **wins** decisively and remains stable under baseline swaps.

## F.8 Error propagation & correlated nuisances

If the SM-theory covariance for (\mu) provides **correlated** HVP components across (e) and (\mu) (rare, but possible via shared dispersion inputs), include them by building a full (2\times2) or (3\times3) block covariance. Otherwise, treat (e) and (\mu) theory errors as independent. Always **separate** experimental and theory blocks so updates are surgical: swap in a new (a_\mu^{\rm SM}) and (\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\rm th}) without touching the rest.

## F.9 Frequentist quick-look (one line)

Because (F.6) is analytic, you can publish a preregistered **quick-look**:
[
\hat\eta \pm \sigma_\eta, \qquad
\chi^2(\hat\eta) - \chi^2(0), \qquad
a_\tau^{\rm pred} \pm \sigma(a_\tau^{\rm pred}).
\tag{F.11}
]
Add the baseline label(s). This lets readers test their favorite SM updates against your locked (\Xi_\ell) without rerunning your code.

## F.10 Forecast bands in plots

* **Band 1:** (a_\mu^{\rm obs}) vs (a_\mu^{\rm SM}) with (\eta) axis implicit (diagonalized by (F.6)).
* **Band 2:** (a_\tau^{\rm pred}) with (1\sigma/2\sigma) shaded, overlay current experimental limits.
* **Corner:** If using the 2-basis, show joint ((\eta_1,\eta_2)) ellipses and the induced (a_\tau) distribution.

## F.11 Pseudocode (drop-in)

```python
# Inputs: ae_obs, amu_obs, SM predictions ae_SM, amu_SM; cov matrices S_exp, S_th
import numpy as np

Xi_e = (m_e/m_mu)        # or vector [m_e/m_mu, (m_e/m_mu)**2]
Xi_mu = 1.0              # normalized at muon point
Xi = np.array([Xi_e, Xi_mu])

d = np.array([ae_obs - ae_SM, amu_obs - amu_SM])  # residuals wrt SM
Sigma = S_exp + S_th
iS = np.linalg.inv(Sigma)

eta_hat = (Xi @ iS @ d) / (Xi @ iS @ Xi)
sigma_eta = 1.0 / np.sqrt(Xi @ iS @ Xi)

atau_pred = a_tau_SM + eta_hat * Xi_tau
sigma_atau = np.sqrt( sigma_a_tau_SM**2 + (Xi_tau*sigma_eta)**2 )
```

Swap branches by changing ((ae_{\rm SM},amu_{\rm SM},\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\rm th})). To open the 2-basis, promote (Xi) to a (2\times2) matrix and solve the normal equations.

## F.12 Falsification logic (hard stops)

* **Joint-fit failure:** No (\eta) exists that keeps (|r_e|) and (|r_\mu|) within their (2\sigma) envelopes simultaneously under any reasonable baseline (\Rightarrow) **reject** the single-parameter map.
* **Tau out-of-band:** New (a_\tau^{\rm obs}) lies outside the preregistered (2\sigma) band built from (\hat\eta) and (\sigma_{\eta|}) (\Rightarrow) **reject**.
* **Baseline fragility:** Sign of (\hat\eta) flips or (|\hat\eta|) changes by (\gg 2\sigma_\eta) across baseline swaps (\Rightarrow) effect is baseline-driven; treat as **null** until stabilized.

## F.13 Minimal reporting table (for the paper)

| Baseline (e, μ)                     | (\hat\eta \pm \sigma_\eta) | (\Delta\chi^2) vs (\eta=0) | (a_\tau^{\rm pred} \pm \sigma) | Verdict |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------: | -------------------------: | -----------------------------: | ------- |
| (\alpha_{\rm Cs}), HVP(_{\rm disp}) |                            |                            |                                |         |
| (\alpha_{\rm Cs}), HVP(_{\rm lat})  |                            |                            |                                |         |
| (\alpha_{\rm Rb}), HVP(_{\rm disp}) |                            |                            |                                |         |
| (\alpha_{\rm Rb}), HVP(_{\rm lat})  |                            |                            |                                |         |

# Appendix G — Cosmology Transport Template: Growth Kernel, Lensing Slip, and Joint Likelihood

## G.1 Baseline and scope

* **Background:** flat ΛCDM fixed to a Planck-consistent posterior mean ({\Omega_m,\Omega_b,h,n_s,\sigma_8, \tau}). (Treat these as fixed numbers here; sensitivity scans can be run offline.)
* **Perturbations:** linear-theory matter growth and weak lensing under a **transport modification** intended to capture a small, redshift-dependent **refractive drag** from the temporal-pressure field (\Gamma).
* **Philosophy:** alter **growth and light propagation**, not the background expansion. This isolates the transport effect and keeps falsifiability crisp.

---

## G.2 Transport modification of linear growth

Work in Newtonian gauge with scalar perturbations (\Phi,\Psi). Define the standard linear growth factor (D(a,k)) via (\delta_m(a,k)=D(a,k),\delta_m(a_i,k)), normalized (D(a_i,k)=1) at early time (a_i).

Introduce a **drag kernel** (\mathcal{R}(a,k;\alpha)) that suppresses growth relative to GR:
[
\boxed{;\frac{d^2 D}{d(\ln a)^2} + \Big[2 + \frac{d\ln H}{d\ln a}\Big]\frac{d D}{d\ln a}

* \frac{3}{2},\Omega_m(a),\mu(a,k;\alpha),D ;=; 0;}
  \tag{G.1}
  ]
  with
  [
  \mu(a,k;\alpha) ;=; 1 - \mathcal{R}(a,k;\alpha), \qquad \mathcal{R}\ge 0.
  \tag{G.2}
  ]

**Minimal one-parameter choice (default):**
[
\boxed{;\mathcal{R}(a,k;\alpha) = \alpha, \Big(\frac{a}{a_0}\Big)^s \Big(\frac{k}{k_*}\Big)^r,,;}
\tag{G.3}
]
with fixed exponents (s\in[1,2]) (late-time turn-on), (r\in{0,1}) (optional mild scale dependence), pivot (k_*=0.2,h,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}), and **single free amplitude** (\alpha) (our “refractive drag” parameter). The **null** is (\alpha=0).

> Interpretation: (\alpha>0) reduces the effective Newtonian clustering strength (via (\mu<1)), mimicking a slight drag on coherence transport that shows up as suppressed late-time growth.

---

## G.3 Lensing slip (optional, orthogonal knob)

Let (\Sigma(a,k)) encode modifications to **lensing** through the Weyl potential (\Phi+\Psi):
[
k^2(\Phi+\Psi) = -8\pi G a^2 \Sigma(a,k),\rho_m \Delta_m.
\tag{G.4}
]
Parameterize
[
\boxed{;\Sigma(a,k;\beta)= 1 + \beta, \Big(\frac{a}{a_0}\Big)^{s_\Sigma} \Big(\frac{k}{k_*}\Big)^{r_\Sigma},,;}
\tag{G.5}
]
with (\beta) the **lensing-slip** amplitude (default (s_\Sigma=1), (r_\Sigma=0)). In the core text we frequently set (\beta=0) (pure-growth test) and open (\beta) only if demanded by lensing residuals.

---

## G.4 Tomographic weak-lensing spectra (Limber)

For source bins (i,j) with normalized redshift distributions (n_i(z)), the convergence power under Limber is
[
\boxed{;C_\ell^{ij} = \int_0^{\chi_H}!! d\chi, \frac{W_i(\chi),W_j(\chi)}{\chi^2},
P_\delta!\left(k=\frac{\ell+1/2}{\chi}, z(\chi)\right),\Sigma^2(z,k);}
\tag{G.6}
]
with comoving distance (\chi), horizon (\chi_H), and lensing kernels
[
W_i(\chi)= \frac{3}{2},\Omega_m H_0^2 \frac{\chi}{a(\chi)} \int_\chi^{\chi_H}! d\chi', n_i(z(\chi')), \frac{\chi'-\chi}{\chi'},.
\tag{G.7}
]
The **matter power** is
[
P_\delta(k,z) = \left[\frac{D(z,k)}{D(z_*,k)}\right]^2 P_\delta(k,z_*) \quad (\text{linear}),
\tag{G.8}
]
with (z_*) in the deep linear era (e.g., 50) and a Planck-consistent primordial spectrum. If desired, splice to a HMcode-style nonlinear correction **after** solving for (D).

---

## G.5 CMB+shear joint likelihood

**Data vector:** concatenated binned spectra
[
\mathbf{d} = \big{ C_{\ell_b}^{ij}\big}_{\text{all }b, i\le j}\ \oplus\ {\text{CMB TT, TE, EE summary}},
\tag{G.9}
]
with corresponding model (\mathbf{m}(\alpha,\beta)) from Eqs. (G.1)–(G.8).

**Covariance:** sum of Gaussian sample variance and shape noise per bin; add survey mask-induced mode coupling if provided. Assemble block-diagonal (shear) ⊕ (CMB) covariance as (\mathbf{\Sigma}).

**Likelihood (Gaussian approximation):**
[
-2\ln \mathcal{L}(\alpha,\beta) = \big(\mathbf{d}-\mathbf{m}\big)^\top \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} \big(\mathbf{d}-\mathbf{m}\big) + \text{const}.
\tag{G.10}
]

**Priors:** broad, zero-centered Gaussians or tophats,
[
\alpha \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_\alpha^2),\ \ \beta \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_\beta^2),
]
with (\sigma) chosen so the prior is uninformative over the survey’s sensitivity window.

**Compression option:** instead of full spectra, compress to ({S_8}) and a small set of lensing-ratio statistics; keep Eq. (G.1) driving (D(z,k)), then map to these compressed observables.

---

## G.6 Cluster-scale vetoes (mergers; halo cores)

### G.6.1 Merger offsets (Bullet-type constraint)

Define an **offset predictor** (\Delta x_{\rm eff}(\alpha,\beta)) for the transport mapping under cluster conditions (supersonic collision of a collisionless dark component with collisional gas). In our correspondence, **no new long-range force** is introduced; only transport refractivity changes. Impose the veto
[
\boxed{;\Delta x_{\rm eff}(\alpha,\beta)\ \le\ \Delta x_{\rm max}^{\rm obs};}
\tag{G.11}
]
where (\Delta x_{\rm max}^{\rm obs}) is the observational upper limit (survey-provided). In practice we enforce this as a **hard prior** or as a **penalty term** added to (-2\ln\mathcal{L}).

### G.6.2 Core regularity (quasi-constant central surface density)

Let (\mu_{0D}\equiv \rho_0 r_0). Observations suggest a nearly constant (\mu_{0D}) across halo families within scatter (\sigma_\mu). Map ((\alpha,\beta)) to a predicted (\mu_{0D}^{\rm pred}) via a calibrated halo model whose **only** modification is the altered linear (P(k)) feeding concentration. Enforce
[
\left|\mu_{0D}^{\rm pred}(\alpha) - \mu_{0D}^{\rm ref}\right| \le n_\sigma ,\sigma_\mu,
\tag{G.12}
]
with (n_\sigma\simeq 2) as a conservative tolerance. This prevents using large (\alpha) to “fix” shear at the cost of grotesque halo-core changes.

---

## G.7 Falsifiers and decision rules

* **F1 (Null prefers):** If (\alpha) (and (\beta), if opened) are consistent with zero at (<1\sigma) and model selection (AIC/BIC/Bayes factor) prefers the null, **do not claim** support; treat transport as constrained to be small.
* **F2 (Tomographic instability):** If best-fit (\alpha) **varies by bin** or flips sign across tomographic splits beyond statistical scatter, the mapping is **incoherent** → reject.
* **F3 (Cluster veto):** If the ((\alpha,\beta)) favored by shear violate merger-offset or core-regularity bounds (G.11–G.12), the model is **ruled out**.
* **F4 (CMB inconsistency):** Growth suppression that “fixes” shear but spoils CMB lensing / ISW cross-checks is rejected.

## G.9 Reporting checklist (for the paper)

* **Model block:** (G.1)–(G.5) with fixed exponents and pivots and a clear statement of what is free.
* **Data block:** survey name/version, tomographic binning, redshift calibration method, scale cuts, covariance construction.
* **Fit block:** (\hat\alpha\pm\sigma_\alpha) (and (\hat\beta\pm\sigma_\beta) if opened), (\Delta\chi^2) vs null, AIC/BIC or Bayes factor.
* **Robustness:** splits by redshift, magnitude, and footprint; stability of (\hat\alpha).
* **Vetoes:** explicit pass/fail for (G.11)–(G.12).
* **Corner plot:** joint posterior in ((S_8,\alpha)) (and (\beta) if opened) showing degeneracies.

---

## G.10 What would convince or kill the correspondence here

* **Convince:** a small, positive (\hat\alpha) that (i) is stable across tomographic splits, (ii) eases shear-vs-CMB tension **without** invoking (\beta), and (iii) respects merger/core vetoes.
* **Kill:** any requirement of large (\alpha) that violates (G.11)–(G.12), or tomographic/sign instability that persists under data revisions, or a nonzero (\beta) whose sign/magnitude **flips by bin**.

# Appendix H — Conscious-Access Analytics: Triad Ridge, PCI, Slowing, and Geometry

## H.1 Overview & data model

* Modalities: MEG/EEG/ECoG (primary), optional fMRI for slow coupling.
* Preprocessing (default): notch, band-stop line noise; robust re-referencing; band-limited IRASA (for 1/f separation) optional; artifact ICs removed; uniform downsampling (≥500 Hz for cross-frequency).
* Epoching: task-bound “access” vs “non-access” windows; for spontaneous transitions, sliding windows (e.g., 2 s with 50% overlap).
* Channels/ROIs: atlas-based parcels or sensor-level with Laplacian montage.
* Prereg triad bands (modifiable by dataset): theta 4–8 Hz; alpha 8–12 Hz; gamma 40–90 Hz. Lock these before analysis.

---

## H.2 Triad ridge: phase locking & cross-frequency metrics

### H.2.1 Instantaneous phases and amplitudes

* Hilbert transform on narrowband filtered signals (x_b(t)) per band (b\in{\theta,\alpha,\gamma}) gives (a_b(t)e^{i\phi_b(t)}).
* For cross-area locking, compute phases per ROI and average with vector strength.

### H.2.2 Inter-areal phase locking (PLV)

For two ROIs (r,s) and band (b):
[
\mathrm{PLV}*{b}^{rs}(t)=\Big|\tfrac{1}{W}\sum*{\tau\in[t-W/2,t+W/2]} e^{i(\phi_{b,r}(\tau)-\phi_{b,s}(\tau))}\Big|.
]
Use (W)=0.5–1.0 s; bias-correct with trial-shuffled nulls.

### H.2.3 Cross-frequency coupling (CFC)

* Phase–amplitude coupling (PAC): modulation index of (a_\gamma) by (\phi_{\theta},\phi_{\alpha}) (Tort MI or GLM-PAC).
* Phase–phase locking (PPL): (\mathrm{PLV}(\ell\phi_\theta - m\phi_\gamma)) for small coprime ((\ell,m)) (e.g., (m!:!\ell=5!:!1) theta–gamma).

### H.2.4 Triad ridge score

Define the ridge as concurrent elevation of:
[
R(t)= z!\left[\overline{\mathrm{PLV}}*{\theta}(t)\right] + z!\left[\overline{\mathrm{PLV}}*{\alpha}(t)\right] + z!\left[\mathrm{PAC}*{\theta\rightarrow\gamma}(t)\right] + z!\left[\mathrm{PAC}*{\alpha\rightarrow\gamma}(t)\right],
]
where (z[\cdot]) are within-session z-scores, overlines denote ROI-averages within preregistered networks (fronto-parietal, hippocampal, etc.). Lock criterion (default): (R(t)) above the 75th percentile of baseline for ≥2 contiguous windows.

**Lead–lag**: estimate directed phase-lag using circular–linear regression or time-delay PLV; preregister expected sign (e.g., frontal theta leads posterior gamma by 10–30 ms).

**Nulls**: (i) trial-shuffle, (ii) phase-randomized surrogates preserving amplitude spectrum, (iii) cycle-circ-shifts within trials.

---

## H.3 Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) protocol

* Stimulation: single-pulse TMS at preregistered intensity (e.g., 110% resting motor threshold) to frontal/parietal ROIs; inter-pulse interval ≥2 s.
* Recording: 1 kHz, 1 s pre/1 s post.
* PCI computation:

  1. Build spatiotemporal binary significance matrix (S(t,r)) from ERP thresholding against pre-stim baselines (cluster corrected).
  2. Compress (S) using Lempel–Ziv complexity; normalize by surrogate ensemble to obtain PCI in [0,1].
* Compare PCI on **triad-on** vs **triad-off** epochs. Preregister a minimum effect size (e.g., ΔPCI ≥ 0.05) and a minimum number of responsive ROIs.

**Controls**: auditory sham; jittered timing; permutation nulls (condition labels), and amplitude-equalized surrogates to ensure PCI isn’t driven by SNR.

---

## H.4 Critical slowing: early-warning indicators (EWI)

For each channel/ROI or the first few PCs in state space:

* **Autocorrelation at lag-1**: (\mathrm{AC}_1(t)) in sliding windows (detrended).
* **Variance**: (\mathrm{Var}(t)) under same windows.
* **Recovery rate**: inject an impulse (TMS pulse or microstimulation) and fit exponential recovery (\tau_{\rm rec}) from the impulse response; slowing predicts **increasing** (\tau_{\rm rec}) near transitions.
* **Flicker metric**: rate of transitions between two quasi-states (HMM or simple threshold crossing) increases near tipping.

**Nulls**: AR surrogate fits per window; stationary block-bootstrap; spectral surrogates matched for 1/f slope.

**Decision rule**: require **coherent rise** in ≥2 indicators across ≥2 independent ROIs, aligned to access loss within a preregistered tolerance (e.g., ±2 s). Mixed signs or instability under nulls ⇒ reject slowing.

---

## H.5 Geometry: embeddings, Jacobi norms, discrete Ricci, harmonics

### H.5.1 State-space embedding and geodesic bundle

* Build trial- or time-local state vectors (y(t)) (ROI power/phase features or latent factors from a variational autoencoder).
* Reduce with Isomap/Locally Linear Embedding/UMAP to (q(t)\in\mathbb{R}^d) (preregister (d\in{3,4,5})); enforce temporal continuity (neighbor penalties).
* Reference path (q_\star(t)): the median trajectory across trials in the access condition.
* **Jacobi surrogate**: for nearest neighbors (q_j(t)), define deviation vectors (\eta_j(t)=q_j(t)-q_\star(t)); estimate (\ddot{\eta}_j) with Savitzky–Golay differentiators. The **Jacobi norm** is (|\eta(t)|=\mathrm{median}_j|\eta_j(t)|).
* **Spike test**: preregister threshold on (z(\ddot{|\eta|})) aligned to access loss.

### H.5.2 Discrete Ricci curvature on dynamic graphs

* Build dynamic functional graphs (G_t=(V,E_t)) from band-limited coherence (e.g., debiased wPLI) with fixed density or threshold.
* **Ollivier–Ricci** edge curvature (\kappa_{\mathrm{OR}}(u,v;t)) via 1-Wasserstein distance between neighbor measures.
* **Forman–Ricci** (\kappa_{\mathrm{FR}}(e;t)) with weight choices: (w_v=) node degree or power; (w_e=) edge coherence.
* **Backbone**: edges with curvature in top (p%) of increases before transition; require spatial consistency across sessions (e.g., Jaccard index ≥ 0.3).

### H.5.3 Connectome-harmonic spill index

* Compute structural Laplacian eigenmodes ({\phi_k}) on the subject-specific or template connectome.
* Project activity onto modes: (c_k(t)=\langle y(t),\phi_k\rangle).
* Define triad band (\mathcal{B}) and **spill index** (S(t)=\sum_{k\notin\mathcal{B}} |c_k(t)|^2 / \sum_k |c_k(t)|^2).
* **Prediction**: (S(t)) low during lock; rises (**broadens**) at break, coincident with curvature/Jacobi spikes.

phi_t = np.angle(hilbert(x_theta, axis=-1))
phi_a = np.angle(hilbert(x_alpha, axis=-1))
amp_g = np.abs(hilbert(x_gamma, axis=-1))

def plv(ph1, ph2, W):
    z = np.exp(1j*(ph1 - ph2))
    return np.abs(np.convolve(z, np.ones(W)/W, mode='same'))

PLV_theta = plv(phi_t[:,roi_i], phi_t[:,roi_j], W=250).mean(axis=0)  # avg over trials
PLV_alpha = plv(phi_a[:,roi_i], phi_a[:,roi_j], W=250).mean(axis=0)

# PAC via GLM-PAC or Tort MI (placeholder)
PAC_tg = glm_pac(phi_t, amp_g)
PAC_ag = glm_pac(phi_a, amp_g)

R = zscore(PLV_theta.mean(axis=0)) + zscore(PLV_alpha.mean(axis=0)) \
    + zscore(PAC_tg) + zscore(PAC_ag)
ridge_mask = smooth(R>np.percentile(R_baseline,75), k=2)
```

### H.7.2 PCI (outline)

S = significant_binary_map(erp, baseline=(-0.5,0), alpha=0.01, cluster_corr=True)
PCI = lz_complexity(S) / lz_complexity_surrogates(S, n=200)
```

### H.7.3 Slowing indicators

```python
def ew_indicators(x, win=1000, step=500):
    AC1, VAR = [], []
    for t0 in range(0, x.shape[-1]-win, step):
        seg = detrend(x[..., t0:t0+win])
        VAR.append(seg.var())
        AC1.append(acf(seg, nlags=1)[1])
    return np.array(AC1), np.array(VAR)
```

### H.7.4 Geometry: Jacobi surrogate & discrete Ricci

```python
# Embedding q(t) via UMAP/Isomap -> q_star(t) = median trajectory
eta = q - q_star
dd_eta = savgol_filter(np.linalg.norm(eta, axis=-1), 21, 3, deriv=2)
spike = zscore(dd_eta) > 2.5

c = phi.T @ y  # mode coefficients over time
B = triad_band_indices
S = (np.sum(np.abs(c[~B])**2, axis=0) / np.sum(np.abs(c)**2, axis=0))
```

---

## H.8 Reporting checklist (paper-ready)

* Data and preprocessing; prereg bands/ROIs/windows.
* Ridge plots (R(t)), with null distributions.
* PCI on/off violin plots; sham controls.
* EWI time-courses with AR-null ribbons; effect sizes.
* Geometry triad: Jacobi spike trace, Ricci backbone heatmap, harmonic spill curve—aligned in time.
* Pass/fail table (H.6) with prereg thresholds and p-values corrected for multiple comparisons (e.g., BH or max-T).

---

## H.9 Failure modes & mitigations

* **Volume conduction / field spread**: prefer debiased measures (wPLI, imaginary coherence); source-space reconstructions if available.
* **1/f confounds**: use IRASA or better aperiodic–periodic separation; confirm ridge not driven by broadband SNR.
* **Spurious PAC**: control for waveform shape (phase–amplitude bias); GLM-PAC with nuisance regressors for power.
* **Stationarity violations**: prewhiten; use local AR surrogates; keep windows short.
* **Embedding drift**: enforce temporal continuity penalties; validate with held-out trials.

---

## H.10 What falsifies the triad–geometry account here

* No **ridge** under access despite adequate SNR and null rejection.
* **PCI** fails to separate on/off cycles in matched conditions.
* **Slowing** indicators do not rise near access loss (with robust nulls).
* **Geometry**: no Jacobi spike, no Ricci backbone, and no harmonic spill broadening at transitions.
* Any **sign-flip/instability** of effects across preregistered splits that survives null controls.

title: Appendix I — Social Θ Model: Threshold/Memory Dynamics, Metrics, and Early Warnings
version: 1.0
status: draft
```

# Appendix I — Social (\Theta) Model: Threshold/Memory Dynamics, Metrics, and Early Warnings

## I.1 Scope and objects

* **Network** (G=(V,E)): directed or undirected; node attributes (A_v) (degree, community, exposure memory params); edge weights (w_{uv}\in[0,1]) (influence).
* **State** (s_v(t)\in{0,1}) (inactive/active); optional multi-state ({0,\dots,K}) for graded participation.
* **Load field** (\Theta_v(t)\ge 0): mesoscopic “dissonance pressure” that modulates thresholds/reinforcement.
* **Goal**: (i) simulate cascades under threshold + exposure-memory rules; (ii) estimate (\Theta) effects in data; (iii) compute **structural virality** and **EWI**; (iv) specify falsifiers.

---

## I.2 Networks: generation and ingestion

**Synthetic** (for calibration):

* Configuration model with target degree sequence; or SBM with (B) communities, mixing matrix (\mathbf{M}).
* Clustering control via triadic closure probability (p_\triangle).
* Weight model (w_{uv} \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha_w,\beta_w)).

**Empirical** (for retrospective tests):

* Build daily (or hourly) snapshots (G_t) from interaction logs; threshold edges by minimum frequency; hold density constant across (t) (top-k per node).

---

## I.3 Threshold backbone (simple vs complex)

Each node has a **personal threshold** (\tau_v\in[0,1]). Let the **reinforced exposure count** by time (t) be
[
X_v(t);=;\sum_{u\in N(v)} \mathbb{1}{s_u(t^-)=1}\cdot R_{uv}(t),
\quad R_{uv}\in{0,1}\text{ is reinforcement eligibility}.
]
Two regimes:

* **Simple contagion**: adopt if (X_v(t)\ge 1) (any neighbor suffices).
* **Complex contagion**: adopt if (X_v(t)\ge k_v) (needs (k_v\ge 2) distinct reinforcing neighbors) **or** if the **weighted fraction** exceeds (\tau_v):
  [
  \frac{\sum_{u} w_{uv},s_u(t^-)}{\sum_u w_{uv}} ;\ge; \tau_v.
  ]

**Reinforcement eligibility** (R_{uv}): default 1 if (u) and (v) share ≥1 common neighbor (clustering proxy); else 0. This encodes the idea that clustered neighborhoods supply redundant evidence.

---

## I.4 Generalized contagion with exposure memory

Let node (v) accumulate **dose** (D_v(t)) from past contacts with active neighbors:
[
D_v(t) = \sum_{t'\le t}\sum_{u\in N(v)} \delta_{uv}(t'),\kappa^{,t-t'},,
]
where (\delta_{uv}(t')\in{0,1}) indicates an exposure at (t') and (\kappa\in(0,1)) is a **memory decay**. Adoption rule:
[
s_v(t)=1\quad \text{iff}\quad D_v(t)\ge \theta_v^{\rm mem},
]
with (\theta_v^{\rm mem}) a memory threshold. This recovers simple/complex contagion as special cases ((\kappa!\to!0) or discrete (k_v) counting).

---

## I.5 How (\Theta) modulates adoption

We model (\Theta) as shifting *both* the **fractional threshold** and the **reinforcement need**:
[
\boxed{;\tau_v^{(\Theta)} = \tau_v - \alpha_\tau,\Theta_v,\qquad
k_v^{(\Theta)} = \max!\big(1,; \lfloor k_v - \alpha_k,\Theta_v\rfloor\big),\qquad
\theta_v^{\rm mem(\Theta)} = \theta_v^{\rm mem},(1-\alpha_m,\Theta_v);}
]
with (\alpha_{\tau,k,m}\ge 0). Optionally, (\Theta) can **up-weight** clustered edges: (R_{uv}^{(\Theta)}= \mathbb{1}{\triangle\text{ present}}\ \lor\ \mathrm{Bernoulli}(\sigma(\beta_R \Theta_v))).

**Normalization**: z-score (\Theta) within snapshot to prevent scale drift; cap at (\Theta\in[0,3]) post-normalize.

---

## I.6 Seeding and exogenous shocks

* **Seeds** (S_0): choose (n_0) seeds by degree, k-core, or random; report sensitivity to seed policy.
* **Shocks**: simulate exogenous broadcast events by injecting a temporary additive term into dose: (D_v \leftarrow D_v + \Delta_{\rm exo}) at (t=t_s) for all (v) in a target set. Use these to test EWI specificity (endogenous vs exogenous).

---

## I.7 Measurables (what we plot/report)

* **Cascade size** (C=\sum_v s_v(T)); **depth** (d) (longest path from a seed in the adoption DAG).
* **Structural virality** (V): mean pairwise shortest-path distance among adopters; or **Wiener index** normalized by (C).
* **Reinforcement curve**: adoption probability vs. number of distinct exposures (r) (empirical dose–response).
* **Exposure memory**: fitted ((\kappa,\theta^{\rm mem})) per cascade via MLE or method-of-moments.
* **Timing**: hazard rate (h(t)) of adoption; inter-event time distribution.
* **Local (R_t)**: effective reproduction number from branching-process fits on the adoption DAG.

---

## I.8 Parameter estimation from data (retrospective)

Given observed cascades on (G_t):

1. **Thresholds**: Fit (\tau_v) by logistic regression of adoption on weighted active-neighbor fraction (node fixed effects optional).
2. **Reinforcement**: Estimate (k_v) or its distribution by regressing adoption on distinct exposure counts with a spline; infer the minimum (k) with BIC.
3. **Memory**: Fit ((\kappa,\theta^{\rm mem})) via likelihood of adoption times given exposure history.
4. **(\Theta) coupling**: Regress fitted ({\tau_v,k_v,\theta^{\rm mem}*v}) on (\Theta_v) with hierarchical priors; report (\alpha*{\tau,k,m}) and credible intervals.
5. **Counterfactual check**: simulate with fitted params but **(\Theta\equiv0)**; compare (C,d,V) to the real cascade. Lack of change falsifies the (\Theta) effect.

---

## I.9 Early-warning indicators (EWI) — retrospective only

Compute on rolling windows (size (W), step (\Delta)) over **activity time series** (A(t)=) #adoptions per unit time:

* **AC(1)**: lag-1 autocorrelation of (A(t)).
* **Variance**: (\mathrm{Var}[A]_W).
* **Flicker rate**: switches between low/high activity regimes (2-state HMM).
* **Skewness** and **CV** (coefficient of variation) as auxiliaries.

**Decision rule** (preregister): EWI-positive if ≥2 indicators rise monotonically over ≥3 consecutive windows in the (T_{\rm pre}) interval prior to a major cascade, are **stable to nulls** (block-bootstrap; AR surrogates), and hold under network partitions (by community or geography). If a declared endogenous event shows **no** EWI coherence, treat it as **exogenous** and mark the (\Theta) hypothesis failed for that event.

## I.11 Simulation loop (pseudocode)

```python
# G: network, Theta: node->float (z-scored per snapshot)

## I.12 Retrospective EWI (pseudocode)

```python

    # adoption_timeseries: counts per bin (e.g., daily)

## I.13 Validation & falsifiers

**Internal validations**

* Recover known regimes: (i) shallow trees for simple contagion with low clustering; (ii) deeper, more redundant trees when (k\ge2) and clustering is high.
* Dose–response sanity: adoption probability increases with distinct exposures; curves shift left as (\Theta) increases (lower effective thresholds).

**Falsifiers**

1. **Reinforcement invariance:** In domains historically requiring reinforcement (e.g., political/identity actions), raising (\Theta) fails to reduce the **distinct exposure** needed for adoption → reject (\Theta\to)threshold mapping.
2. **Tail rigidity:** Under high (\Theta), cascade size tails and **structural virality** do **not** thicken compared to baseline → reject tipping interpretation.
3. **EWI null:** Major endogenous events show **no** coherent EWI rise (AC1/Var/Flicker) under prereg nulls and partitions → treat as exogenous; (\Theta) narrative not supported.
4. **Overfit alert:** Model needs node-level (\alpha)’s or time-varying (\Theta) with implausible volatility to match data → prefer simpler nulls (no (\Theta) coupling).

## I.14 Ethics & usage constraint

Analyses are **retrospective** and **aggregate**. No individual-level prediction or operational surveillance. Release only **dataset-level** (\Theta) summaries and cascade metrics; mask or coarsen sensitive attributes; document data sources and consent regimes.

---

## I.15 Reporting checklist

* Network construction (windows, density, weighting), seed policy.
* Fitted ({\tau_v,k_v,\kappa,\theta^{\rm mem}}) distributions and their regression on (\Theta).
* Counterfactuals ((\Theta\equiv 0)) vs observed—size/depth/virality deltas.
* EWI dashboard with null ribbons; pass/fail per prereg.
* Falsifier outcomes (1–4) with brief rationale.
