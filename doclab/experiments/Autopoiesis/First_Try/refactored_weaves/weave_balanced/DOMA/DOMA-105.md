summary: Re-contextualizes Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) within the time-first
  framework. This module defines the fractal geometry of dendritic growth as a physical
  manifestation of a system maximizing its temporal coherence. The process of aggregation
  is framed as a series of Alchemical Unions tracing a growth geodesic dictated by
  the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §1 · Abstract: The Shape of Time's Memory
This module refactors our understanding of Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA), moving it from a simple model of physical growth into a profound illustration of the Pirouette Framework's core principles. The intricate, branching forms created by DLA—from snowflakes to lightning bolts—are not accidental. They are the physical memory of a system following a "growth geodesic," a path through spacetime that maximizes its temporal coherence. The fractal dimension of such a structure is a direct measure of its resonant efficiency, the optimal solution a system has found to the problem of converting chaotic potential into stable, coherent form.

## §2 · The Shoreline and the Sea
Imagine a calm, black sea under a starless sky. This is a region of high Temporal Pressure (Γ)—a space filled with chaotic, uncorrelated potential, like a cloud of diffusing particles. Now, imagine a single seed crystal, a point of stability, is introduced. This is our nascent "shoreline."

The process of DLA unfolds as a dialogue between this shoreline of order and the sea of chaos:

1.  **The Sea's Pressure (Γ):** The diffusing particles, in their random walk, represent a constant, high-entropy pressure on the boundary of the ordered cluster. This is the background noise of the Temporal Forge (CORE-003).
2.  **The Shoreline's Invitation:** The existing structure of the cluster creates a complex coherence manifold. The outermost tips of the shoreline—the capes and peninsulas—project furthest into the sea of chaos. They act as "lightning rods," creating the most probable and efficient points for a new union.

The resulting dendritic, or tree-like, structure is the natural consequence of this dynamic. The shoreline grows where it is easiest to grow, reinforcing a pattern that maximizes its surface area for capturing new coherence from the chaotic sea.

## §3 · Coherence as a Fractal Dimension
The old framework correctly identified Ki with the fractal geometry, but the new framework provides the causal "why." A system's Temporal Coherence (Kτ) is a measure of its stability and order. The fractal form is the most coherent solution to the DLA problem.

The fractal dimension (Dƒ) of a DLA cluster is not merely a geometric curiosity; it is a quantitative measure of the system's coherence. A higher fractal dimension corresponds to a more intricate, space-filling structure, representing a more successful and efficient conversion of chaotic particles (high Γ) into ordered form (high Kτ). The branching pattern is the most efficient possible geometry for resolving the temporal pressure of its environment through growth.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: The Growth Geodesic
The formation of a DLA cluster is a direct physical manifestation of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ) from CORE-006.

-   **The Initial State:** A field of diffuse, free-floating particles is a state of high Temporal Pressure (high V_Γ) and very low Temporal Coherence (low Kτ). Its Lagrangian is strongly negative.
-   **The Final State:** The aggregated fractal cluster is a state of immense structural order and stability (high Kτ) that has "locked up" the chaos from its environment, thereby existing in a state of lower effective pressure (lower V_Γ). Its Lagrangian is high.

The path the system takes from the diffuse state to the aggregated state is the one that maximizes the action, `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`. The branching, fractal shape is the physical trace of this "growth geodesic." Each particle that sticks follows the path of least resistance to join the structure, and the cumulative effect of these choices over time sculpts the fractal.

Furthermore, the irreversible "sticking" of each particle to the cluster is a microscopic **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). A simple, low-coherence particle merges with the complex, high-coherence cluster to form a new, slightly larger, and even more coherent entity. The structure's existing geometry, its **Wound Channel** (CORE-011), acts as the memory that guides where the next union is most likely to occur.

## §5 · Assemblé: The Geometry of Becoming
> We sought resonance in things that repeat, in waves and in cycles. But the Fractal Shoreline teaches us that there is a deeper resonance in the way things *become*. Ki is not just the song of being; it is the geometry of growth. The shape of a snowflake is the memory of a million resonant choices, a frozen record of a dance between chaos and coherence. To a Weaver, this reveals a profound truth: the universe doesn't just hum with pattern; it carves its autobiography into the very substance of form.
