## §1 · Abstract: The Illusion of the Island
The old framework analyzed a world of separate fields overlapping in a neutral space. This was a useful but incomplete picture. The time-first refactoring reveals a more profound truth: there is only one manifold, one shared landscape of coherence, and every resonant entity is a musician whose song helps compose it.

This module replaces the concept of a "Resonant Field Overlay" with the principle of the **Composite Manifold**. It describes how the ceaseless interference of countless temporal rhythms—the echoes of every entity's existence—sculpts the very terrain of reality. The "space" between things is not empty; it is a dynamic medium, humming with the constructive and destructive interference of every nearby song.

## §2 · From Rhythms to Reality
The creation of the Composite Manifold is a direct, continuous consequence of the principles laid out in the core axioms. The process is as follows:

1.  **A Symphony of Echoes:** Every system resonates with its unique Ki pattern, leaving a persistent geometric wake—its Wound Channel—in spacetime (CORE-011).
2.  **Temporal Superposition:** At any point in spacetime, the local environment is a superposition of the echoes from all Wound Channels within its causal horizon. This creates a complex, multi-layered `Temporal Signature T(x)`.
3.  **The Forge of Interaction:** This complex signature is the raw input for the Temporal Forge (CORE-003). The constructive and destructive interference of these overlapping rhythms generates a new, localized Temporal Pressure (Γ).
4.  **A New Landscape:** This new Γ defines the "potential term" in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), effectively creating a new, composite coherence manifold. This landscape is not static; it is a dynamic, fluid topology, constantly being reshaped by the rhythms that compose it.

The old module's `F_total = sum(F_i)` is thus re-expressed not as a sum of forces, but as the emergence of a new terrain upon which all forces will play out.

## §3 · The Geometry of Interference
The character of the Composite Manifold—its peaks, valleys, and currents—is determined by the geometry of the interfering rhythms.

**Constructive Interference (Resonant Valleys):** When two or more Ki patterns are in-phase or harmonically compatible, their echoes reinforce one another. This constructive interference creates regions of **reduced Temporal Pressure**. These are "coherence channels" or resonant valleys in the manifold—stable, low-friction paths of least resistance. Systems are naturally drawn into these channels, which form the basis for attraction, symbiosis, and the "Resonant Handshake" that precedes an Alchemical Union (CORE-012).

**Destructive Interference (Dissonant Peaks):** When Ki patterns are out-of-phase or dissonant, their echoes cancel or chaotically interfere. This destructive interference creates regions of **increased Temporal Pressure**. These are "coherence dams" or turbulent peaks in the manifold—unstable, high-friction zones that repel systems or drain their coherence. This is the physical mechanism behind repulsion, conflict, and competition.

The emergent features of the old model—new attractors, null zones, saddle points—are now understood as the natural topology of this sculpted, composite landscape.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This principle is formalized through its effect on the Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

When multiple systems (1, 2, ..., N) interact, their individual contributions to the local Γ are not simply additive. The "potential" term `V_Γ` becomes a complex function of all interacting Ki patterns: `V_Γ_total = f(Γ(Ki_1, Ki_2, ..., Ki_N))`.

The resulting Composite Manifold is the landscape defined by this new `V_Γ_total`. The dynamics of any entity navigating this shared space are still governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**: it will follow the geodesic (the path of least action) that maximizes the integral of `𝓛_p` through this new, composite terrain. All multi-body interactions are thus unified under this single, elegant principle.

## §5 · Assemblé
> A Weaver must understand that no song is sung in a vacuum. Every note you play adds to the composition of the world, creating harmony in one place and dissonance in another. To act wisely is to listen to the music that is already playing, and to choose a rhythm that builds a cathedral of resonance rather than a cacophony of ruin. The world is not a stage for soloists; it is a single, ongoing symphony, and you are a composer of its next measure.
