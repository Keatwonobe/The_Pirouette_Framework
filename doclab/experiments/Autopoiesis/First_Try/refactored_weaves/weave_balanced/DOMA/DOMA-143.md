## §1 · Abstract: Surveying the Arena Walls

The universe is not a uniform field; it is a nested series of arenas. Quarks are confined in protons, stars are confined in galaxies, and ideas are confined in belief systems. The old module, TEN-GFI-1.1, sought to infer the force responsible for this confinement. This modernized version provides the formal instrument for mapping the *geometry* of that confinement.

The Gladiator Compass is a universal protocol for detecting and measuring the "arena walls" in any domain. It translates a stream of events—whether the motion of particles or the flow of a conversation—into a topographical map of the local coherence manifold. By measuring where paths are short and trajectories are bent, it reveals the invisible structures of stability and control that shape reality. It does not infer a force; it surveys the landscape forged by that force.

## §2 · From First Principles to a Measurable Geometry

The core insight of the original module is preserved and clarified: the same geometric principles that trap a particle also trap a concept. This phenomenon is an expression of the Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`), which arises from a non-linear feedback loop in the Pirouette Lagrangian that forges stable, bounded systems.

This instrument provides the two key metrics needed to map the effects of that force:

*   **Path Density (δ):** The inverse of an entity's "mean-free path." In a discourse, this is how far an idea can travel before being challenged or altered. A high path density signifies a region of intense interaction and high Temporal Pressure (Γ), where movement is restricted.
*   **Coherence Curvature (γ):** The rate of change in a trajectory's direction. In a discourse, this is how sharply a line of argument must bend to remain acceptable within the conversation. High curvature signifies a strong "pull" towards a central attractor.

The strength of a confinement well is a function of both. A prison is defined by its thick walls (high density) and the constant pressure that forces inmates back to the center (high curvature).

## §3 · The Modern Equation: Quantifying Confinement

To avoid confusion with the foundational parameter of Temporal Pressure (Γ), the output of this instrument is defined as Confinement Strength (κ). The core mechanic of the old formula is preserved, but its terms are re-expressed with greater clarity.

**Confinement Strength (κ) = Path Density (δ) × Coherence Curvature (γ)**

Where:

*   **Path Density (δ)** = `1 / (mean_divergence + ε)`
*   **Coherence Curvature (γ)** = `gradient(coherence_metric)`

A high κ value emerges where paths are both short (high δ) and sharply bent (high γ). This is the unambiguous signature of a confinement well—the heart of an arena.

## §4 · The Surveyor's Protocol

This protocol guides the Weaver from a raw data stream to a finished map of the local confinement landscape.

1.  **Ingest & Vectorize:** Begin with an ordered stream of events (e.g., statements in a debate, positions of a particle) and convert them into a sequence of high-dimensional vectors.
2.  **Calculate Path Density (δ):** Within a sliding window, compute the average semantic or spatial divergence between consecutive events. The inverse of this value is the Path Density, δ.
3.  **Calculate Coherence Curvature (γ):** Within the same window, measure the change in the system's trajectory. This is the gradient of coherence, or γ. For example, the difference in divergence between the start and end of the window.
4.  **Compute Confinement Strength (κ):** For each window, multiply the two metrics: `κ = δ × γ`.
5.  **Map the Arenas:** Plot the resulting κ-field over time or space. Local maxima in this field are the centers of "Cognitive Gravity Wells," ideological strongholds, or stable physical structures. These are the arenas forged by the Gladiator Force.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This instrument provides a direct, empirical window into the dynamics of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

The Gladiator Force manifests as a non-linear feedback loop where a system's own resonance (`K_τ`) dramatically increases the local Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`), creating a deep potential well. The Gladiator Compass measures the observable consequences of being inside such a well:
*   The high **Path Density (δ)** is a direct proxy for the intense Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) within the well.
*   The high **Coherence Curvature (γ)** is the signature of a system following its geodesic of maximal coherence, which is sharply bent by the steep gradients of this well.

Therefore, the Confinement Strength (κ) is a measurable representation of the intensity of the Gladiator feedback term in the Lagrangian. It is how we see the equation's abstract terms made manifest as a real, confining structure.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought to measure the strength of the cage and instead learned how to draw a map of its walls. The Gladiator Compass does not break chains; it makes them visible. It reveals the architecture of our confinement, whether that confinement is the sacred bond that holds a family together or the ideological prison that tears a world apart. To a Weaver, this is the most fundamental of all powers: to see the shape of the walls is the first and most necessary step to finding the door.
