## §1 · Abstract: The Universe's Echo
The universe does not waste its breath. The same simple rule that shapes a lightning bolt can be heard in the branching of a tree and felt in the pathways of a thought. This is the principle of self-similarity, the universe's native grammar for building complex, resilient, and efficient structures from the simplest of seeds.

This module refactors the old "Fractal/Recursive Pattern Analysis" into a time-first instrumentation protocol. It moves beyond describing static geometry to understanding the *temporal process* that generates it. A fractal is not a shape; it is a stable, resonant pattern (`Ki`) whose coherence is preserved across multiple scales of time and space. It is the universe's echo, repeating its own song in ever-finer detail.

## §2 · From Geometry to a Generative Process
A fractal pattern is the visible trace of a system that has found a remarkably efficient solution to the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). It is a strategy for maximizing internal coherence (`Kτ`) while gracefully navigating the external Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) across a vast range of scales.

This scale-invariance is the pattern's defining characteristic. A fractal `Ki` is a resonance whose fundamental structure—its geometric or harmonic relationships—remains intact whether viewed from afar or up close. A coastline's complexity does not vanish upon magnification; it reveals more coastline. This property confers an immense advantage, allowing a system to process information, dissipate energy, or fill a space with an elegance that simple Euclidean forms cannot match. The fractal is a geodesic on the coherence manifold that is itself a fractal.

## §3 · The Signatures of Fractal Coherence
To analyze a fractal process, we move beyond a simple description of its shape and measure the dynamic properties of its growth. We replace the old, cumbersome list of "Resonant Vectors" with three core signatures:

1.  **Complexity `(D_f)`**: This is the classic Fractal Dimension. In this framework, it measures how effectively the generative `Ki` pattern fills its "possibility space." A higher `D_f` indicates a more complex and intricate structure, capable of creating a more detailed interface with its environment.

2.  **Inter-Scale Coherence `(T_a_scale)`**: This is the direct modernization of the old `Ta` parameter. It measures the fidelity of the self-similar pattern across different scales or iterations. It is the signal-to-noise ratio of the generative grammar itself. A high `T_a_scale` signifies a pure, well-preserved rule, like a crystal. A low `T_a_scale` suggests a more organic, noisy process, like a tree whose branches are shaped by the wind.

3.  **Generative Rhythm `(ω_g)`**: This modernizes the old `Ki` constant. It is the fundamental frequency or "beat" of the recursive process that generates the pattern. It is the temporal heartbeat of the fractal's growth, defining the characteristic scale of its primary iteration.

## §4 · Diagnostic Protocol
Analyzing a system for its underlying grammar is a three-step process:

1.  **Identify the Channel**: Locate the system or data stream exhibiting potential self-similarity. This could be the structure of a network, the fluctuations of a market, or the branching of a decision tree.

2.  **Measure the Signatures**: Apply computational methods (e.g., Box-Counting, Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis) to the data to quantify the three core signatures: its Complexity `(D_f)`, its Inter-Scale Coherence `(T_a_scale)`, and its Generative Rhythm `(ω_g)`.

3.  **Correlate with the Manifold**: Analyze how these signatures relate to the system's broader state. How does the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) of the environment influence the pattern's final complexity? A system under high pressure may be forced into simpler forms, while a system in a quiescent environment may have the "freedom" to explore more intricate possibilities.

## §5 · The Generative Equation (Revisited)
The original module contained a crucial insight linking the fractal dimension of generative "bloom" events to the core parameters. We preserve and re-express this relationship in the new framework's language, showing how a pattern's complexity emerges from the interplay of its own rules and its environment:

`D_f ≈ 1 + C * (ω_g) * ( T_a_scale / (1 - T_a_scale) ) * f(Γ)`

Where `C` is a constant and `f(Γ)` is a function describing the constraining influence of the ambient Temporal Pressure. This equation formalizes the intuition that a pattern's complexity (`D_f`) is amplified by a strong generative rhythm (`ω_g`) and a highly coherent recursive rule (`T_a_scale`), but is ultimately bounded and shaped by the pressure of its environment (`Γ`).

## §6 · Assemblé: The Assemblé

> We sought to analyze complexity and found a simple grammar repeated into infinity. The universe writes its story—of mountains, of minds, of markets—using a very small alphabet. To be a Weaver is to learn to read this script, not just to understand the world, but to recognize the simple, elegant rules required to build a new one. To see the grammar of growth is to hold the pen.
