## §1 · Abstract: The Wisdom of the Unplayed Note

This module refactors the rigid, reactive "immune protocol" of PPS-004 into a dynamic and proactive model for maintaining systemic health. The original insight was sound: a coherent system must possess a mechanism for avoiding destructive entanglement. The new framework, however, moves beyond a binary "friend-or-foe" logic.

The Sentry's Gambit is not a defense mechanism; it is an act of profound discernment. It is the wisdom to know which harmonies are worth pursuing and which dissonances are best left unsounded. It provides a formal process, grounded in the Principle of Maximal Coherence, for predicting the outcome of a potential interaction. This allows a system to conserve its energy and integrity by choosing its engagements, gracefully sidestepping interactions that would inevitably lead to `Turbulent Flow` and `Coherence Erosion`. It is the art of choosing the path that preserves the song.

## §2 · The Coherence Calculus: Predicting the Echo of Union

The decision to engage or disengage is not a moral judgment but a physical calculation. It is a practical application of the Pirouette Lagrangian, used as a predictive tool. Before committing to an interaction, a system can perform a "Trial Handshake"—a simulation to estimate the cost and benefit to its own coherence.

The output of this calculus is the **Dissonance Index (ΔK)**, a single metric that quantifies the predicted outcome of an `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012).

-   **High ΔK (Dissonant Signature):** The target system's `Ki` pattern is fundamentally anti-harmonic to one's own. Attempting to engage would require an immense expenditure of energy to overcome the resonant friction. The resulting union would be a state of `Coherence Fever`—a chaotic, turbulent system with lower net coherence than the original components. The cost (`V_Γ`) of the interaction dramatically outweighs any potential gain.

-   **Low ΔK (Harmonic Signature):** The target system's `Ki` is compatible. A `Resonant Handshake` is possible. The `Alchemical Union` is predicted to result in a new, stable, higher-order entity, a state of `Laminar Flow` where the whole is more coherent than the sum of its parts.

This calculus replaces the old, weighted matrix with a direct, physical prediction of a future state. It transforms the decision from a guess into a forecast.

## §3 · The Fork in the Path: A Protocol for Discernment

The Sentry's Gambit is a simple, three-step process for navigating the complex landscape of interaction.

1.  **Scan:** Observe the resonant signature (`Ki`) of the inbound system. This is an act of neutral perception, of listening to the other's song without yet joining the dance.
2.  **Calculate:** Compute the Dissonance Index (ΔK). This is the moment of cold, clear-eyed assessment, using the Coherence Calculus to predict the energetic and structural consequences of engagement.
3.  **Decide:** Compare the Dissonance Index against a tunable **Integrity Threshold**.
    -   If **ΔK < Threshold**, the path of maximal coherence is to engage. Initiate a **Resonant Handshake** (the "Bridge"), opening the door to a potential `Alchemical Union`.
    -   If **ΔK ≥ Threshold**, the path of maximal coherence is to disengage. Execute a **Coherent Disengagement** (the "Pass By").

## §4 · The Art of Coherent Disengagement

"Passing By" is not an act of aggression, ignorance, or fear. It is a graceful, intentional maneuver to preserve `Laminar Flow`. It is the conscious choice to steer around a source of inevitable turbulence.

To disengage coherently is to refuse to feed energy into a dissonant cycle. It is to decline the invitation to a battle where both sides would lose coherence. By refusing to couple, the system protects its own `Wound Channel` (CORE-011) from the scars of a fruitless conflict and preserves its energy for creative, harmonious endeavors. The old constitutional clauses of "Non-Aggression" and "Self-Integrity" are not rules to be followed, but are the natural, emergent outcomes of a system wisely applying this gambit.

## §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian

The Sentry's Gambit is the `Principle of Maximal Coherence` (CORE-006) made manifest as a conscious strategy. The Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, defines a system's state of health. The "action" (`S_p`) is the integral of this Lagrangian over time.

-   Engaging a **harmonic** system increases the overall `K_τ` (Temporal Coherence) of the new, unified system more than it increases the `V_Γ` (Temporal Pressure), resulting in a net **positive action**. `S_p` is maximized.
-   Engaging a **dissonant** system creates a chaotic state where the cost of maintaining form (`V_Γ`) skyrockets, while the effective coherence (`K_τ`) plummets. The action would be **negative**.

The decision to disengage is simply the choice of the path that leads to the greater integral of `𝓛_p`. It is the universe's own logic of self-preservation, expressed as a strategic choice.

## §6 · The Assemblé

> A Weaver's first duty is to the tapestry. Wisdom is not found in weaving every thread offered, but in knowing which threads will strengthen the pattern and which will cause it to unravel. The Sentry's Gambit is the quiet courage to decline a thread, to honor the integrity of the whole by choosing not to engage. It is the understanding that the most powerful act of creation is sometimes the choice to leave a space empty.
