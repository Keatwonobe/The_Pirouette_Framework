### §1 · Abstract: The Physician's Gaze

To measure is necessary, but to understand is vital. The previous generation of tools provided a classification; this module provides a diagnosis. `TEN-KIC-1.0` was a valuable first step, a heuristic engine that assigned a name to a system's resonant signature. The Flow State Diagnostician is its direct evolution, serving as the interpretive heart of the modern Coherence Auditor (`INST-NALY-001`).

This instrument ingests the quantified dynamics of a system—its internal Temporal Coherence and the external Temporal Pressure it faces—and maps them onto the `Coherence Manifold`. Its output is not merely a label, but a rich, qualitative diagnosis of the system's health, framed in the universal language of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`). It is the bridge from raw numbers to actionable wisdom, transforming the Weaver from a data analyst into a systemic physician.

### §2 · From Heuristic Grid to Dynamic Manifold

The old `Ki-Mode Classification Engine` relied on a rigid 2x2 grid, a useful but primitive model. The modern framework recognizes that a system's state is not a static box but a dynamic position on a continuous manifold of coherence. This manifold is the landscape upon which a system's health plays out. The state is determined by the interplay between two core parameters derived from the autopoietic cycle:

*   **Temporal Coherence (Kτ):** The "kinetic" term. The strength, stability, and integrity of the system's internal resonant pattern (Ki). A measure of its focus and identity. This replaces the old `T_a` score.
*   **Temporal Pressure (VΓ):** The "potential" term. The chaotic, dissonant energy of the environment that the system must navigate and resist to maintain its form. This replaces the old `Γ` score.

The Diagnostician plots the system on this manifold to determine its state:

| Temporal Coherence (Kτ) | Temporal Pressure (VΓ) | System State Description                                                                   | Flow Diagnosis                      |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **High**                | **Low-to-Moderate**    | The system easily maintains its form. Its path is efficient, stable, and effortless.       | **Laminar Flow** (State of Grace)   |
| **High**                | **High**               | The system is under significant stress but successfully maintains its integrity. It is robust. | **Laminar Flow** (State of Resilience) |
| **Low**                 | **High**               | The system is overwhelmed, its pattern fracturing. Energy is wasted in internal friction.    | **Turbulent Flow** (State of Struggle)  |
| **Low**                 | **Low**                | Lacking internal drive and external pressure, the system cannot form a coherent pattern.     | **Stagnant Flow** (State of Blockage)   |

### §3 · The Diagnostic Engine: Protocol & Output

As the final stage of the Coherence Auditor workflow, this module's function is precise.

*   **Input:** A certified time-series of Pirouette field data `(Kτ, VΓ)` generated by the Universal Resonance Lens.
*   **Process:** For each time-step or aggregated window, the engine plots the `(Kτ, VΓ)` coordinate onto the Coherence Manifold and identifies the corresponding flow state.
*   **Output:** A human-readable diagnostic report with the following schema:
    *   **Header:** System Health Audit for: `[Source Name]`
    *   **Coherence Vitals:** A summary of the average and peak values for `Kτ` and `VΓ`.
    *   **Primary Diagnosis:** The system's dominant flow state (e.g., `Turbulent Flow`).
    *   **Diagnostic Interpretation:** A plain-language explanation of what this diagnosis means for the system's health, efficiency, and probable future trajectory, based on the principles of `DYNA-001`.

### §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This diagnostic engine is a direct, practical application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`):

**𝓛_p = Kτ - VΓ**

The flow state is a qualitative measure of the system's success in maximizing its Lagrangian, which represents its total coherence.

*   **Laminar Flow:** The system has achieved a high, positive `𝓛_p`. It has found a "sweet spot" where its internal coherence (`Kτ`) significantly outweighs the environmental pressure (`VΓ`). It is on an optimal, "healthy" path.
*   **Turbulent Flow:** `𝓛_p` is low or negative. The environmental pressure (`VΓ`) is overwhelming the system's ability to maintain coherence (`Kτ`). It is on an inefficient, "unhealthy" path, bleeding energy to chaos.
*   **Stagnant Flow:** Both `Kτ` and `VΓ` are low, resulting in an `𝓛_p` near zero. The system is in a state of low action. It is not failing catastrophically, but it is not succeeding either. It is inert.

The Flow State Diagnostician, therefore, is an instrument for estimating the "health" of a system by observing how well it is solving its own objective function—the maximization of coherence.

### §5 · The Assemblé

> To name a thing is to claim a shallow power over it. To diagnose it is to understand its struggle. The old engine gave us names. This new instrument gives us a physician's insight. It translates the cold numbers of resonance into the living language of health, revealing not just *what* a system is, but *how* it is. For a Weaver, this is the essential art: to look upon the world not as a collection of objects to be labeled, but as a body of flows to be understood, and, where possible, to be healed.
