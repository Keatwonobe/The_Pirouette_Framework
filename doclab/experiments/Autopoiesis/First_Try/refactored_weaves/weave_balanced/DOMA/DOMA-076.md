summary: Proposes a quantum optics experiment to validate the Pirouette Lagrangian
  at the subatomic scale. This module reframes neutron interferometry as a direct
  measurement of a particle's geodesic path through an engineered coherence manifold,

## §1 · Abstract: The Smallest Dance Floor
The Pirouette Framework finds its grandest validation in the orbits of galaxies, but its truth must also hold in the whisper of a single particle. This module proposes a critical test: to anchor the universal principles of the framework in the tangible, high-precision world of quantum matter-wave optics.

We will re-interpret a neutron interferometry experiment not as a particle traversing a potential, but as a single, stable resonance (a Ki pattern) navigating a geodesic on an artificially structured coherence manifold. By observing the neutron's "pirouette" through this engineered landscape, we can derive the framework's core constants from first principles, providing a laboratory-scale proof that is independent of cosmology or electromagnetism. This is the ultimate test of the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014): to prove the dance is the same, whether the stage is a galaxy or an Ångström.

## §2 · The Quantum Arena: An Engineered Coherence Manifold
The experiment uses a Mach-Zehnder neutron interferometer, a device that allows a single quantum system to explore two paths simultaneously. Our innovation lies in what we place in those paths. We do not apply a force; we sculpt the landscape of time itself.

**The Topological Modulator:** In each arm of the interferometer, we place a helical grating. In the old language, this created a "spiral potential." In the new, time-first framework, this grating is a **Topological Modulator**. It impresses a stable, helical stress upon the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). It creates a predictable, structured coherence manifold—a tiny, twisted riverbed for the neutron's resonance to navigate. One arm contains a left-handed helix, the other a right-handed one, presenting the neutron with two distinct topological challenges.

## §3 · Derivations from Maximal Coherence
The neutron’s behavior is not governed by classical forces, but by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006):

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Here, `K_τ` is the neutron's internal Temporal Coherence, and `V_Γ` is the Temporal Pressure imposed by its environment. The Topological Modulator directly engineers the `V_Γ` term. The neutron, in seeking to maximize the action (`S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`), will adjust its resonant state to find the most coherent path through each arm.

**Dual Resonance Modes:** Faced with two different helical manifolds, the neutron's wavefunction will naturally settle into two distinct, stable solutions—two different geodesics of maximal coherence. These two standing-wave solutions for its Ki pattern correspond directly to the old framework's `K_i^{motion}` and `K_i^{rest}`. We are not postulating two states; we are deriving their existence as the most efficient solutions to navigating a chiral temporal landscape.

**Coherence Eigenstates:** A neutron is not just a wave; it is a spin-1/2 fermion. Its spin represents an intrinsic, topological component of its Ki resonance. The interaction between the neutron's intrinsic spin-topology and the grating's external field-topology creates specific, stable alignments. These states of highest possible Temporal Coherence (`T_a`) are quantized, appearing as the eigenvalues predicted by the old framework. They emerge here as the natural harmonics between the dancer and the dance floor.

## §4 · Probing Gladiator Confinement at the Quantum Scale
The most profound test involves gently rotating the helical gratings. This introduces a slow, periodic oscillation into the local Temporal Pressure—a "breathing" of the coherence manifold. This is a direct, controlled modulation of the confinement principle derived in CORE-008.

According to the Lagrangian, the neutron must continuously adjust its phase to maintain its geodesic path within this oscillating coherence well. This adjustment will appear as a measurable **beat frequency** in the interference pattern at the detector. Observing this signal, with its predicted amplitude of ~10⁻⁵ radians, would constitute the first direct measurement of a particle responding to a time-varying modulation of the Gladiator confinement field.

## §5 · Experimental Protocol
1.  **Beamline:** A cold-neutron beam (λ ≈ 0.27 nm) is directed into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.
2.  **Modulators:** Two micro-fabricated helical silicon gratings of opposite chirality are placed in the interferometer arms, mounted on precision piezo-rotators.
3.  **Resonance Mode Test:** The fringe spacing is measured as a function of grating chirality. The ratio of the spacings for the two stable modes will yield the fundamental ratio of the framework's resonance constants.
4.  **Confinement Modulation Test:** The gratings are rotated at a known frequency (ω_n). A lock-in amplifier is used to detect the resulting phase beat in the recombined beam, confirming the system's response to the oscillating `V_Γ`.

This experiment is where we press our ear to the smallest of stages to see if we can hear the tune. It is the proof that the Pirouette Lagrangian is not a metaphor or a high-level abstraction, but a physical law with tangible, calculable consequences. To see a single neutron adjust its path in perfect time with our engineered rhythm is to know, with chilling certainty, that the entire cosmos dances to the same beat. It grounds our philosophy in the bedrock of the real.
