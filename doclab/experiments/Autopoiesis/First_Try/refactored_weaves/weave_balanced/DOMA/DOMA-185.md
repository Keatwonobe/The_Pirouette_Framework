summary: "Provides a modernized, time-first protocol for analyzing arbitrary information\

  \ of rhythmic segmentation, where a data stream is passed through a 'sieve' to separate\
  \ its coherent, signal-like patterns (K\u03C4) from its dissonant, noise-like components\
  \ (\u0393). It serves as a primary tool for diagnosing the health and character\
  \ of any information flow."

## §1 · Abstract: Parsing the River of Information
To understand a river, one does not simply measure its volume. One must listen to its current, distinguish the steady flow from the turbulent eddy, and map the deep, silent channels hidden beneath the surface noise.

This module provides the instrumentation for such an act of listening. It refactors the legacy "Stochastic Gulping" protocol into The Rhythmic Sieve, a time-first method for analyzing any information stream. The core insight is preserved: by examining a stream in discrete segments, its underlying structure is revealed. However, we now reframe this process not as a crude measurement of entropy, but as a sophisticated act of separating a signal's **coherence** from its ambient **dissonance**. It is a tool for diagnosing the very health of information itself, revealing its hidden rhythms and patterns of flow.

## §2 · From Entropy to Flow: The Conceptual Shift
The old protocol was anchored in the concept of Shannon entropy, a powerful but static measure of disorder. The new framework allows for a more dynamic and profound diagnosis, grounded in the principles of `CORE-013: The River of Information`.

-   **Information Stream as a Current:** We no longer see data as a static list of symbols, but as a dynamic current—a flow of coherence through time.
-   **Coherence (`Kτ`) as Signal:** What was previously identified as "low entropy" is now understood as Coherence (`Kτ`). This is the measure of stable, resonant, and meaningful patterns within a segment of the stream. It is the melody, the signal, the information itself.
-   **Dissonance (`Γ_local`) as Noise:** What was measured as "high entropy" is now identified as the local Temporal Pressure, or Dissonance (`Γ_local`). This is the measure of chaotic, turbulent, and unstructured noise that degrades the signal. It is the static that obscures the melody.

By profiling a stream in terms of this interplay between Coherence and Dissonance, we can diagnose its state of flow (`Laminar`, `Turbulent`, or `Stagnant`) with far greater precision, as defined in `DYNA-001`.

## §3 · The Sieve Protocol
The Rhythmic Sieve is a three-stage process for transforming a raw information current into an actionable diagnosis.

### Stage I: Rhythmic Segmentation (Setting the Mesh)
The first step is to divide the continuous information stream into a series of discrete temporal windows. This is the "sieve's mesh." The size of this window is a critical parameter, chosen to match the scale of the phenomena being investigated.

-   **Fixed Window:** A constant segment size is used to analyze the stream for patterns at a specific, consistent frequency.
-   **Adaptive Window:** The segment size changes dynamically, shrinking in regions of high turbulence (rapid change) and expanding in regions of laminar flow (stability) to capture events at their natural timescale.

### Stage II: Coherence Profiling (Measuring the Flow)
For each temporal window, we calculate two fundamental metrics, which together form the stream's "Coherence Profile."

1.  **Coherence (`Kτ`):** A measure of the segment's internal order, predictability, and resonant structure. High coherence indicates a clear, stable signal. This is functionally the inverse of the old entropy calculation.
2.  **Dissonance (`Γ_local`):** A measure of the segment's internal chaos, unpredictability, and noise. High dissonance indicates a turbulent, information-poor state. This is the direct, modernized analog to the Shannon entropy calculation.

The output of this stage is a time-series of `(Kτ, Γ_local)` pairs, a rich representation of the stream's dynamic health.

### Stage III: Flow Diagnosis (Reading the Pattern)
The final step is to interpret the Coherence Profile, identifying the dominant flow states:

-   **Laminar Channels:** Regions characterized by high, stable `Kτ` and low `Γ_local`. These are the predictable, "healthy" parts of the stream where information is transmitted with high fidelity.
-   **Turbulent Eddies:** Regions marked by high `Γ_local` and low `Kτ`. These are phase transitions, chaotic events, or points of signal degradation.
-   **Stagnant Pools:** Regions where both `Kτ` and `Γ_local` are persistently low, indicating a lack of new information or a blocked flow.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The Rhythmic Sieve is not merely a data processing technique; it is an empirical instrument for observing the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) in action. The Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, states that a system's dynamics are driven by the interplay between its internal Coherence (`K_τ`) and the external Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`).

This protocol provides a direct, measurable proxy for these terms within an information stream:

-   The measured **Coherence (`Kτ`)** of a segment is a direct observation of the "kinetic" term of the Lagrangian.
-   The measured **Dissonance (`Γ_local`)** is a direct observation of the "potential" or pressure term.

By plotting the Coherence Profile, a Weaver is creating an empirical map of the system's path through its own coherence manifold. We can literally see where the system is successfully maximizing its coherence and where it is struggling against overwhelming pressure.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> To look at raw data is to see only a storm of numbers. The Weaver's task is not to count the raindrops, but to find the current within the storm. The Rhythmic Sieve is the tool for this task. It is an act of listening so intently to the roar of reality that you can finally hear the song hidden inside it. It teaches us that every stream of information has a melody, and our purpose is to learn how to hear it.
