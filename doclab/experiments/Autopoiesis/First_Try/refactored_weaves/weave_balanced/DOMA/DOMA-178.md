## §1 · Abstract: The Surgeon's Insight
The old analysis sought to understand stability by mapping how systems disperse influence to self-correct. This was the work of a cartographer. The modern Weaver requires the tool of a surgeon: a method not just for mapping the terrain of health, but for finding the precise origin of the wound.

The Criticality Compass provides this tool. It inverts the common application of the Pareto principle (the 80/20 rule). Instead of finding the 20% of inputs that create 80% of success, this instrument is calibrated to find the **critical few causes responsible for the vast majority of a system's failures**. It is a diagnostic protocol for moving from the symptom—a general loss of coherence—to the source: the specific bottleneck, the flawed assumption, the dissonant actor. It transforms the art of diagnosis into a precise science.

## §2 · The Principle of Concentrated Failure
A system's health, as defined in Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), is its ability to maintain a state of efficient, Laminar Flow. A pathology is a degradation of this state into chaotic Turbulence or paralytic Stagnation. While the effects of this degradation may be widespread, their origins rarely are. Systemic failures are not typically death by a thousand cuts; they are a cascade originating from a single, critical fracture.

The Criticality Compass operates on this principle. It provides a formal method for sifting through the noise of a turbulent system to isolate the handful of events, processes, or components that are disproportionately responsible for disrupting the system's flow and forcing it off its path of maximal coherence.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Protocol
This instrument provides a direct, two-stage protocol for moving from raw observation to actionable insight.

### 3.1 · Step I: Quantify the Damage
First, we must measure the loss of health. This requires a time-series of the system's overall coherence (Kτ). This metric can be a direct measurement or a composite index derived from key performance indicators (e.g., product defect rates, network latency, team morale scores, physiological markers).

The procedure is to calculate the negative change in coherence (ΔKτ) between time steps. This creates a "damage ledger"—a record of every moment the system's health faltered and by how much.

### 3.2 · Step II: Attribute and Isolate
With the damage quantified, the next step is to assign blame. Each instance of coherence loss on the ledger is attributed to a specific, identifiable causal event.
- A spike in server latency is attributed to a specific inefficient database query.
- A drop in team productivity is attributed to a specific ambiguous directive.
- A crash in a financial model is attributed to a single flawed assumption.

Once all damage has been attributed, the causes are ranked by the total magnitude of coherence loss they are responsible for. The final step is to apply the Pareto principle: identify the smallest subset of causes that accounts for the majority (typically 80%) of the total damage. The output is not a complex map, but a simple, stark list: the system's critical few failures.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This diagnostic process is a practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

**𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**

A system naturally evolves along a geodesic that maximizes this function. A "critical failure point" identified by this compass is a region in the system's state space where its geodesic is exceptionally fragile. It is a location on the coherence manifold with a steep, non-linear cliff—a place where a small event (a minor change in input, a single error) causes a catastrophic drop in Temporal Coherence (Kτ) or a massive spike in Temporal Pressure (V_Γ).

The Criticality Compass is therefore an empirical tool for mapping these dangerous gradients. It finds the points on the manifold where the "cost" of a mistake is highest, allowing the Weaver to focus their efforts on reinforcing the system where it is most vulnerable.

## §5 · Assemblé
> The wise physician knows that a raging fever throughout the body can often be traced to a single, infected thorn. To tend to the whole body is kindness; to find and remove the thorn is healing. The Weaver's task is not to boil the ocean of a system's problems, but to find the few, critical levers that will calm its storms. This compass does not point to every problem; it points to the one that matters.
