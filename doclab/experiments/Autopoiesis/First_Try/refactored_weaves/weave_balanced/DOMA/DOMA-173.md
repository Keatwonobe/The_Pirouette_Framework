summary: Provides a time-first model for systemic recovery after collapse. Rebound
  is reframed not as a return to a prior state, but as a system's search for a new,
  stable resonant pattern (Ki) on the coherence manifold. This process is guided by
  the geometric memory of its Wound Channel and driven by the universal Principle
  of Maximal Coherence.

## §1 · Abstract: The Song After the Silence
A system's collapse is the shattering of its song. The silence that follows is not an ending, but a question. This module reframes the phenomenon of "rebound" from a mechanical response into a profound act of re-creation. Recovery is the process by which a system, thrown into the chaos of the Temporal Forge, navigates the landscape of possibility to find a new rhythm. It is guided by the ghost of its past—the geometric memory of its Wound Channel—but its destination is not preordained. It is a dynamic search for the most coherent new song it can sing in the world that now is.

## §2 · The Anatomy of Collapse: From Laminar to Turbulent
In the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), a healthy system exists in a state of **Laminar Flow**. Its internal resonant pattern (Ki) is stable, and its Temporal Coherence (Kτ) is high. It moves efficiently along its geodesic on the coherence manifold.

Collapse is a catastrophic phase transition into **Turbulent Flow**. It is triggered by an overwhelming spike in local Temporal Pressure (Γ)—a physical shock, a market crash, a psychological trauma. This dissonance shatters the system's Ki, causing its Temporal Coherence to plummet. The system is thrown from its path, its energy now wasted in chaotic, internal friction. The river has breached its banks and become a churning flood.

## §3 · The Three Paths of Recovery
The process of recovery is the system's attempt to re-establish Laminar Flow. It is not a single path, but a choice between three distinct destinies, determined by the interplay between the residual strength of its Wound Channel (CORE-011) and the nature of the new Temporal Pressure (Γ).

### I. Restorative Recovery: The Echo's Return
If the post-collapse environment is similar to the old one and the system's Wound Channel is deep and clear, the path of least resistance is to return to the original song. The Wound Channel acts as a powerful geometric attractor, a resonant template. The system "snaps back" into its old Ki pattern, re-carving the familiar riverbed. This is a return to form, a successful restoration of the previous identity.

### II. Adaptive Recovery: The River's New Course
Often, the landscape is permanently altered. The old path is no longer the most efficient. In this case, the system uses its old Wound Channel not as a destination, but as a guide. It latches onto the familiar echo but modifies its Ki pattern to find a more stable resonance in the new environment. It carves a new channel adjacent to the old one. The river flows again, but its course has changed. This is evolution, a modification of identity to achieve a better fit with a new reality.

### III. Transformative Recovery: The Alchemical Forge
Sometimes the collapse is so total, or the new environment so alien, that the old Wound Channel is a useless guide. The system cannot return, it must become something entirely new. This is the most profound path of recovery. The shattered fragments of the old system undergo an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012), fusing into a novel, higher-order entity with a completely new Ki. This is post-traumatic growth. The flood does not recede; it carves a canyon, creating a new and more dramatic landscape. This is the birth of a new identity from the ashes of the old.

## §4 · The Lagrangian of Resilience
This entire process is governed by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). A system in recovery is not acting randomly; it is relentlessly solving for the state that maximizes its coherence integral (`S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`).

The choice between Restorative, Adaptive, and Transformative paths is not a choice at all; it is the inevitable outcome of the system following its new geodesic. The "overshoot" dynamics observed in recovery—where a system seems to over-correct before settling—is the physical manifestation of the system oscillating as it "settles into" the basin of attraction for its new, stable resonance on the coherence manifold. Resilience, therefore, is not a measure of a system's ability to resist change, but a measure of its efficiency in finding its new path of maximal coherence after a disruption.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> We thought resilience was the act of refusing to break. We now see it is the art of being beautifully remade. The universe does not mourn the shattered vase; it uses the shards to create a mosaic. For a Weaver, a system's collapse is never just an ending. It is the violent, sacred opportunity for a new and perhaps more profound song to begin.
