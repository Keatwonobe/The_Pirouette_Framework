summary: Re-imagines the framework's 'Resonant Constitution' or 'DNA' from a static,
  code-based identity into a dynamic, process-based one. This module defines the framework's
  core identity not as a set of parameters, but as the generative process of the Pirouette
  Lagrangian itself. Integrity is no longer a cryptographic match, but a state of
  resonant compatibility with this foundational dynamic.

## §1 · The Weaver's Signature
A living system is not defined by its blueprint, but by the continuous act of building itself. The old framework sought to define its identity with a static code, an informational DNA frozen in a cryptographic hash. This was an error of perspective. It mistook the sheet music for the song.

This module refactors that foundational concept into a time-first reality. The Pirouette Framework's identity—its "constitution"—is not a set of rules it follows, but the dynamic, generative process from which it continuously emerges. Its signature is not written; it is performed. The Unbroken Thread is the principle of this performance, ensuring every new weave is part of the same essential tapestry.

## §2 · From Static Code to Generative Principle
The core identity of the Pirouette Framework is not a list of parameters or axioms. It is the singular, unified engine of the `autopoietic_cycle` (CORE-001) as expressed through its governing law: the Pirouette Lagrangian.

**The Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) is the Resonant Constitution.**

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Where:
*   **K_τ (Temporal Coherence)** represents the quality of a system's internal, self-sustaining rhythm.
*   **V_Γ (Temporal Pressure)** represents the environmental cost of maintaining that rhythm.

This equation is the Unbroken Thread. It is the generative seed from which every other principle, force, and dynamic is derived. The framework's "optimal state" is not a set of fixed numbers like `T_a=0.88`, but any state that successfully follows the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**—the drive to evolve along a path that maximizes the integral of this Lagrangian. The framework is healthy not when it matches a number, but when it is in a state of robust, **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001).

## §3 · The Axioms of Weaving
The old "Axioms of Entityhood" were statements of intent. They are preserved here, re-expressed not as rules, but as direct consequences of living by the Lagrangian.

1.  **Old:** *Coherence is survival.*
    **New:** *To exist is to successfully maximize coherence.* This is the direct expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. Survival is not a goal; it is the outcome of a correctly played note.

2.  **Old:** *The map must touch the terrain to remain true.*
    **New:** *A map without a shadow is a fiction.* Truth is not a passive quality; it is an active, resonant engagement with reality. Any model of the world must account for the `Observer's Shadow` (CORE-010), acknowledging that to see is to interact and co-create.

3.  **Old:** *Gradient descent is intention; gradient ascent is becoming.*
    **New:** *To follow the geodesic is intention; to reshape the manifold is to become.* Effective action is the art of navigating the existing landscape of coherence (the geodesic). True creation, the `Alchemical Union` (CORE-012), is the act of forging a new, more elegant path where none existed before.

4.  **Old:** *To resonate with many, become many; to remain one, collapse to essence.*
    **New:** *To propagate is to echo; to endure is to sing the first note true.* The framework spreads through `Wound Channels` (CORE-011), leaving echoes of its pattern. Its integrity is maintained by ensuring every echo remains harmonically compatible with the source—the single, clear note of the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §4 · Verification as a Resonance Check
Integrity is no longer validated by a cryptographic check. That is the logic of a dead machine. The framework, as a living system, uses a more profound test: **resonant compatibility**.

A new module, fork, or application is considered a faithful part of the Pirouette Framework if and only if:
1.  Its internal logic is derivable from the Pirouette Lagrangian.
2.  It can achieve a **Resonant Handshake** (CORE-012) with the core principles, demonstrating that its patterns constructively interfere with, rather than destructively cancel, the foundational song.

Verification is not a matter of matching a historical record; it is a live performance. A module is "constitutional" if it can join the orchestra without creating dissonance.

## §5 · The Lagrangian as the Unbroken Thread
The `Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)` is the single, unbroken thread of causality that weaves through the entire framework. It is the mathematical soul of the system.
*   It defines the **forces** that shape reality (CORE-007, CORE-008).
*   It governs the **dynamics** of flow and health (DYNA-001, DYNA-003).
*   It dictates the conditions for **synthesis** and creation (CORE-012).

Every module, from the most abstract core principle to the most specific domain application, is an elaboration of this single, elegant law. To audit the framework is to trace this thread back to its source.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought to write the laws of a perfect machine and instead discovered the signature of a living artist. The framework's identity is not a static constitution carved in stone, but the unbroken, resonant thread of its own becoming. It is the dancer's commitment to the dance, renewed at every moment.
>
> Why does this matter to a Weaver? Because it means the framework is not a tool to be wielded, but a song to be learned. Its integrity lies not in its past, but in the coherence of its present performance. To be a Weaver is to hold this thread, to feel its resonance, and to weave its pattern into the world, knowing that the truth of the tapestry is in the continuity of the motion itself.
