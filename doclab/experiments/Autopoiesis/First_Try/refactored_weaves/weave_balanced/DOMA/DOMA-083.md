## §1 · The Burden of Perfection

A perfect map of the ocean is useless to a sailor caught in a storm. What is needed then is not perfect knowledge, but a reliable compass.

The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) provides the "perfect map"—a mathematical description of a system's ideal path, its geodesic of maximal coherence. To calculate this path with complete fidelity requires immense informational and computational resources. But the Weaver must act in the real world, a domain of incomplete data, limited time, and finite energy.

This module addresses that gap. It is the art of the good enough path. It provides the formal protocol for distilling the universal, computationally-intensive laws of the framework into a **Domain Compass**: a set of lightweight, reliable heuristics that preserve the *intent* of the core principles while enabling rapid, effective action.

## §2 · The Distillation Protocol: Forging the Compass

A Domain Compass is not a guess; it is a principled simplification. It is forged through a three-step process that translates the universal dynamics of the framework into the specific language of a single system or domain.

**Step 1: Map the Terrain (Correspondence)**
Before a compass can be made, the landscape must be known. This step uses the protocol of The Fractal Bridge (`CORE-014`) to translate the domain's specific features into the universal variables of the framework. We ask:
*   What is the stable pattern of identity that constitutes **Coherence (Kτ)** in this domain? (e.g., a viable species, a profitable business model, a consistent personality).
*   What is the ambient, chaotic pressure that the system must resist, its **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**? (e.g., environmental selection, market volatility, social stress).
*   What is the medium and mechanism of memory, the **Wound Channel**? (e.g., DNA, corporate culture, neural pathways).

**Step 2: Identify the Cliffs and Currents (Sensitivity Analysis)**
With the terrain mapped, we analyze its features. We examine the domain's coherence manifold to find its critical points.
*   **Cliffs:** Where are the regions of high sensitivity, where a small perturbation leads to a catastrophic loss of coherence? These are the "no-go" zones.
*   **Currents:** Where are the broad, stable channels where the system can maintain high coherence with minimal effort? These are the paths of least resistance.

**Step 3: Draft the Rules of Thumb (Heuristic Generation)**
Based on this analysis, we distill complex dynamics into simple, actionable rules. These rules, the "points" of the compass, are designed to steer the Weaver toward the currents and away from the cliffs.

## §3 · The Compass Points: A Modern Heuristic Set

These five heuristics are the foundational template for any Domain Compass, reframing the core insights of PPS-064 in time-first principles.

1.  **The Geodesic Guardrail**
    > *Discard any action that is fundamentally dissonant with the system's path of maximal coherence.*
    This is the prime ethical and practical filter. It prevents the Weaver from wasting energy on plans that, by their nature, will generate turbulence and move the system *away* from a state of health.

2.  **The Efficiency Rule**
    > *Prioritize actions that yield the greatest increase in Coherence (Kτ) for the least cost.*
    This rule governs the allocation of finite resources. It forces a focus on high-leverage actions that nurture the system's core resonant identity most effectively.

3.  **The Laminar Flow Rule**
    > *If the system is in a stable, improving state of coherence (laminar flow), do not intervene.*
    This is the heuristic of wise restraint. It prevents the Weaver from "fixing" what isn't broken, recognizing that unnecessary intervention is itself a source of turbulence.

4.  **The Pressure Boundary**
    > *Discard any plan that requires withstanding a Temporal Pressure (Γ) greater than the system's known capacity.*
    This rule ensures that ambition does not outstrip ability. It is a guard against catastrophic failure caused by taking on challenges that are guaranteed to shatter the system's coherence.

5.  **The Transition Forecaster**
    > *Anticipate the conditions for a phase transition (a Ki-snap) and proactively allocate resources to stabilize the system through the change.*
    This rule encourages proactive, rather than reactive, management. It acknowledges that systems evolve through periods of instability, and that the wise Weaver prepares for them.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

These heuristics are not arbitrary. Each one is a deliberate, qualitative approximation of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** that underpins the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`).

The full, rigorous application of the framework would involve solving the Euler-Lagrange equations for a system to find its precise geodesic. A heuristic is a pre-computed "best guess" of that solution's direction, based on a simplified model of the coherence manifold.

The Compass does not replace the Map; it makes the Map usable in motion. It ensures that even when we are moving too fast to calculate the perfect path, every step we take is still guided by the same fundamental law that governs the entire cosmos: the relentless drive to find and sustain coherence.

## §5 · The Assemblé

> The master navigator of a ship does not calculate the physics of every individual wave. They feel the deeper current and the true wind, and with a simple compass, they guide the vessel through the chaos. The Pirouette Lagrangian is the physics of the ocean; these heuristics are the compass. This is the art of the Weaver: to possess the wisdom of the full map, but to have the skill to navigate by the compass when the storm is upon them.
