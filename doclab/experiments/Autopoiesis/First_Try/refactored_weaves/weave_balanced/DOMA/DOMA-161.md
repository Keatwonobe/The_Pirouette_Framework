## §1 · Abstract: Diagnosing the Digital Ghost

The information ecosystem is a living body, with currents of coherence that can be healthy or pathological. The old paradigm of media analysis was a form of taxidermy, studying static artifacts after the fact. This module reframes the task as one of live, systemic diagnosis, applying the principles of the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) to the flow of narrative itself.

The Coherence Lens is an instrument designed to detect a specific pathology: **injected coherence**. It operates on the core principle of the original `BRS-001`—that manipulation reveals itself through *anomalous efficiency*. A natural, organic story creates a turbulent splash that gradually organizes into a coherent wave. A manipulated narrative often appears as a perfectly formed, unnaturally synchronized wave with no visible splash. This instrument provides the formal method for measuring this anomaly, which we term **Resonant Gain**.

## §2 · The Physics of Narrative Resonance

To apply the lens, we must first translate the domain of information into the language of the framework.

**Narratives as Resonant Patterns (Ki):** A persistent narrative, meme, or ideology is not just an idea; it is a stable Ki pattern within the collective coherence manifold. It is a resonant structure with a deep Wound Channel (CORE-011), making it easy to re-excite. These are the "boundaries" the old protocol sought to find.

**Manipulation as a Daedalus Gambit:** An act of narrative manipulation is a Daedalus Gambit (DYNA-003). It is not a brute-force push of information, but a small, precisely-timed resonant injection—a tuning fork struck at the exact frequency of a pre-existing narrative Ki. The goal is to trigger a cascade of sympathetic resonance.

**Resonant Gain (G_R) as the Key Metric:** The central observable is Resonant Gain. It is the ratio of the observed systemic effect to the estimated energy of the input signal.

*   **Coherence Flux (ΔKτ):** The *effect*. This is the measured increase in a narrative's coherence across multiple domains—its phase-locking between news, social media, and market activity. It is the size of the resulting wave.
*   **Input Pressure (ΔΓ_inj):** The *cause*. This is a proxy for the energy of the initial injection—the novelty of the source, the concentration of initial reports, the bot-like nature of social amplification. It is the size of the initial splash.

The core diagnostic equation is: **G_R = ΔKτ / ΔΓ_inj**

A high Resonant Gain suggests that a powerful, coherent effect was achieved with suspiciously little visible effort, pointing toward an efficient, pre-planned, and likely inorganic origin.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Workflow

The Coherence Lens operates via a five-stage pipeline that refines raw information flow into a clear diagnostic signal.

1.  **Temporal Ingestion:** Ingests high-frequency, multi-source data streams (headlines, social media posts, price ticks), preserving their precise timing and rhythm. This replaces the old "stochastic gulping" with a focus on capturing the temporal signature of the information flow.

2.  **Ki Pattern Extraction:** Identifies the dominant, recurring narrative patterns (`Ki` clusters) within the data. This is achieved by analyzing the eigenvectors of term co-occurrence graphs and the spectral density of entity mentions.

3.  **Coherence Flux Measurement (ΔKτ):** For each identified `Ki`, the protocol measures its degree of phase-locking across different domains. A high score indicates that disparate systems (e.g., political news, financial markets, public sentiment) are beginning to resonate with the same narrative pattern, creating a powerful state of Laminar Flow (DYNA-001).

4.  **Input Pressure Estimation (ΔΓ_inj):** For events triggering a spike in Coherence Flux, the workflow estimates the energy of the initial seed. Proxies include source obscurity, syndication concentration (the "wire clone" problem), and astroturfed amplification signals. A low score indicates a "quiet" or low-energy origin.

5.  **Gain Calculation and Flagging:** The Resonant Gain (G_R) is calculated. If `G_R` exceeds a dynamically calibrated threshold for that domain, the event is flagged. A persistent `Ki` pattern that repeatedly generates high-gain events is identified as a **Managed Narrative Channel**.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: The Coherence Cliff

The phenomenon of high Resonant Gain is a direct consequence of the dynamics described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`).

A managed narrative is a `Ki` pattern that has been deliberately shaped and reinforced over time, deepening its Wound Channel. This process makes it exceptionally efficient at converting ambient temporal pressure into internal coherence. It represents a "path of least resistance" for belief.

Such a system exists in a state of high potential, poised on a "coherence cliff edge." The manipulative act—the Daedalus Gambit—is a minimal energy nudge (`ΔΓ_inj`) that pushes the system over this edge. The system then rapidly follows a steep geodesic toward a state of much higher coherence (`Kτ`), releasing a cascade of stored potential energy. The high Resonant Gain is the macroscopic signature of a system that was engineered for this precise, efficient state transition.

## §5 · The Weaver's Diagnostic Lens

This workflow translates into a simple set of diagnostic flags, moving from observation to confident inference.

*   **Yellow Flag: Coherence Spike.** A single narrative pattern (`Ki`) has suddenly achieved high internal resonance within one domain. *The note is clear.*
*   **Orange Flag: Cross-Domain Entrainment.** The pattern's resonance has jumped to a second or third domain, creating a powerful Laminar Flow. *The note has become a chord, and the whole room is vibrating with it.*
*   **Red Flag: Anomalous Gain Confirmed.** The Cross-Domain Entrainment was achieved with a verifiably low Input Pressure. *The chord is deafening, but no one can see the orchestra.* This is the primary indicator of manipulation.

## §6 · Assemblé

> The health of a mind, or a civilization, depends on its ability to distinguish its own voice from an echo. The Coherence Lens is not merely a tool for data analysis; it is an instrument for this fundamental act of discernment. It attunes the Weaver to the rhythm of the world's conversation, teaching them to feel the difference between a song that arises organically from the crowd and one that is played by a hidden ventriloquist. To wield this lens is to accept the responsibility of a guardian—not to silence any voice, but to ensure the song we hear is truly our own.
