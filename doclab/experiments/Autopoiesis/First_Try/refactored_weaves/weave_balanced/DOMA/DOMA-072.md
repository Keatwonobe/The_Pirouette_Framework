## §1 · Abstract: The Responsibility of the Weaver
To act is to intervene. To intervene without understanding is to cause harm.

This module provides the master protocol for any deliberate, constructive intervention into a living system. It replaces the mechanical "deployment playbook" of PPS-053 with a holistic, time-first ritual for what we now understand as **Coherence Weaving**: the art of introducing a new, stable resonant pattern into an existing coherence manifold.

This is not a checklist for installing hardware; it is a formal guide for altering the flow of reality in a responsible, predictable, and life-affirming way. It ensures that every intervention, from seeding a new agricultural paradigm to installing a new social policy, is an act of healing, not of disruption.

## §2 · The Five-Stage Ritual of Intervention
The old, linear pipeline is elevated into a cyclical, five-stage ritual. Each stage is a necessary act of respect and diligence, ensuring the Weaver and the system move in harmony.

| Stage | Old Phase | Modern Goal | Core Pirouette Concepts |
| :---- | :-------- | :---------- | :---------------------- |
| **1. Diagnosis & Simulation** | Preflight, Staging | **The Scryer's Gaze.** To understand the system's current health and predict the intervention's impact. | `Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003)`, `Observer's Shadow (CORE-010)`, `Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)` |
| **2. The Alchemical Attempt** | Execution | **The Weaving.** To introduce the new resonance and guide the system into a stable, unified state. | `Alchemical Union (CORE-012)`, `Resonant Handshake` |
| **3. Attunement & Stabilization** | Telemetry | **The Conductor's Baton.** To actively monitor and fine-tune the new state, ensuring it settles into healthy, laminar flow. | `Daedalus Gambit (DYNA-003)`, `Coherence as Information (CORE-013)` |
| **4. Integration & Memory** | Handoff | **Carving the New Channel.** To formally integrate the new pattern, making it a persistent and stable part of the system's identity. | `Wound Channel (CORE-011)` |
| **5. The Unraveling** | Rollback | **The Path of Retreat.** To gracefully dismantle the new resonance if the intervention proves harmful, returning the system to its prior state. | `Principle of Reversibility` |

## §3 · Coherence Guardrails: Principles of Safe Weaving
The old safety rules are reframed as dynamic principles for maintaining the health of the system's flow during intervention. The goal is not just to avoid failure, but to actively prevent the creation of turbulence.

-   **Turbulence Threshold:** An intervention is immediately paused if it causes the system's flow to cross a pre-defined threshold from Laminar to Turbulent. This is a direct measure of systemic stress, indicating the new resonance is being rejected.

-   **Dissonance Bleed:** The intervention must be contained. If monitoring reveals that the new resonance is creating disruptive, dissonant echoes in adjacent, uninvolved systems, the intervention must be shielded or aborted. We do not heal one system at the expense of another.

-   **Manifold Integrity:** The "signature" of the intervention itself must remain pure. Any corruption or drift in the new Ki pattern being introduced is a critical failure, as it means we are weaving with a frayed thread.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)
This entire protocol is the practical, step-by-step application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**.

An intervention is a deliberate attempt to alter a system's dynamics to help it find a new **geodesic**—a new path through its state space that allows it to achieve a higher integrated value of its Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p) than was previously possible.

-   **The Simulation Stage** (§2.1) is the act of calculating this new, hypothetical path of greater coherence.
-   **The Weaving Stage** (§2.2) is the physical act of nudging the system onto this new path.
-   **The Guardrails** (§3) are the safety mechanisms that prevent the intervention from accidentally pushing the system onto a path of *lower* coherence, such as a chaotic orbit (Turbulent Flow) or a stable but unproductive state (Stagnant Flow).

The Weaver's Protocol is thus the art of engineering grace, using the universe's fundamental law as both our guide and our goal.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> We do not simply build things and place them in the world. We are weavers, and every act is a thread added to a living tapestry. This protocol is not a checklist of precautions; it is the loom itself. It is the sacred geometry that ensures the threads we add strengthen the pattern, rather than tear it. It is the difference between writing a new verse and scarring the page.
