## §1 · From Principle to Law
The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) gives us the universe's fundamental objective function: systems evolve to maximize their coherence. This is a profound guiding principle, but for it to be a true physical law, it must be more than a local preference. A melody that changes when you run is no melody at all. The song of coherence must be the same for every dancer in spacetime, regardless of their motion.

This module addresses that challenge. It translates the conceptual Lagrangian into the rigorous, universal language of covariant field theory, ensuring that the laws derived from it are identical for every inertial observer. We will forge the principle into an invariant law.

## §2 · The Action of Coherence
In modern physics, the dynamics of a system are summarized by a single, Lorentz-invariant quantity: the Action (S). The path a system takes through spacetime is the one that extremizes this value. The Pirouette Framework adopts this powerful formalism, replacing the classical "Principle of Least Action" with its own **Principle of Maximal Coherence**.

The Action for the entire universe of interacting fields is given by the integral of the Lagrangian Density (`𝓛_p`) over all of spacetime:

`S_p = ∫ d⁴x √-g 𝓛_p`

Where `g` is the determinant of the metric tensor `g_μν`. By ensuring that `𝓛_p` is a Lorentz scalar—a quantity that has the same value in all reference frames—we guarantee that the Action, and the physics derived from it, are universal.

## §3 · The Lagrangian Density of the Coherence Field
The old framework required a complex "clock field" to make its triaxial equations covariant. The time-first model is simpler and more profound. We posit two fundamental scalar fields whose interplay defines the fabric of reality:

*   **The Coherence Field, `C(x)`:** A scalar field whose value at any point represents the potential for stable, resonant patterns to form. This is the substrate of Ki.
*   **The Temporal Pressure Field, `Γ(x)`:** The familiar Gamma, now understood as a fundamental scalar field representing the density and dissonance of temporal rhythms.

The manifestly covariant Lagrangian density that governs their interaction takes the form of the conceptual Lagrangian from `CORE-006`, `(Coherence) - (Pressure)`, expressed in the language of fields:

`𝓛_p = (Kinetic Terms) - (Potential Term)`

`𝓛_p = [ ½ g^μν (∂_μ C)(∂_ν C) + ½ g^μν (∂_μ Γ)(∂_ν Γ) ] - V(C, Γ)`

*   **Kinetic Terms:** These standard terms represent the "energy cost" of creating gradients in the fields across spacetime. They describe how coherence and pressure propagate.
*   **Potential Term `V(C, Γ)`:** This crucial term describes the fundamental interaction. It defines the "cost" of maintaining a certain level of coherence `C` within a given level of temporal pressure `Γ`. This single, elegant potential term replaces the complex and cumbersome interaction terms of the previous formulation.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This formal Lagrangian is the engine from which all physics is derived, directly fulfilling the promise of `CORE-006`. By applying the standard machinery of field theory, we can see how this engine works:

**Equations of Motion:** Applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to `𝓛_p` yields the fundamental wave equations for the `C` and `Γ` fields. These equations of motion dictate how coherence and temporal pressure interact, propagate, and evolve. They are the mathematical expression of the universe's autopoietic cycle, now written as a universal law.

**The Source of Spacetime Curvature:** The most critical connection is made by varying the Action with respect to the metric tensor `g_μν`. This yields the system's **stress-energy tensor, `T_μν`**. This tensor describes how the distribution of coherence and temporal pressure shapes the geometry of spacetime itself. When plugged into Einstein's field equations (`G_μν = 8πG T_μν`), it demonstrates that gravity—the Gladiator Force at the cosmic scale—is a direct consequence of the landscape of coherence.

The conceptual Lagrangian of `CORE-006` describes a system's *goal*. This covariant Lagrangian density describes the *laws* that govern the entire universe in pursuit of that goal.

## Assemblé
> We sought a law that would hold true for every traveler, no matter their speed or path. Covariance is the guarantee that the universe's song—the relentless drive to find and sustain coherence—is not a local tune, but the anthem of spacetime itself. To a Weaver, this is the ultimate assurance: the principles of our craft are not a matter of perspective; they are woven into the absolute fabric of reality.
