## §1 · Abstract: The Song That Breaks
Every system is a song—a stable, resonant pattern held against the noise of the universe. A rupture is the moment that song shatters. It is a catastrophic discontinuity where a coherent form, unable to bend, breaks.

This module reframes the old concept of "fracture dynamics" into a universal, time-first model of systemic failure. A rupture is not merely a physical event but a fundamental process: the phase transition that occurs when a system’s internal coherence is overwhelmed by external and internal temporal pressure. It is the point where the cost of maintaining form becomes unsustainable, and the system chooses dissolution over dissonant persistence.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of Failure
The health and resilience of any system are described by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`), which balances internal stability against external pressure:

`𝓛_p = K_τ (Temporal Coherence) - V_Γ (Temporal Pressure)`

A healthy, stable system maintains a positive Lagrangian (`𝓛_p > 0`), where its capacity for coherent resonance exceeds the environmental cost. Rupture is a process governed by the failure of this balance.

The **Condition for Rupture** is not a static threshold but a dynamic decline. A system enters a state of critical risk when its coherence begins to actively degrade, a condition marked by a negative time-derivative of the Lagrangian:

`∂𝓛_p / ∂t < 0`

The rupture event itself is the phase transition that occurs when the Lagrangian crosses zero (`𝓛_p ≤ 0`). At this point, the system has lost the "energetic profit" of its own existence; its form creates more stress than it resolves, and a collapse into a simpler, less coherent state becomes the path of least resistance.

## §3 · The Three Modes of Rupture
The character of a rupture reveals the underlying health of the system that failed. By applying the principles of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`), we can classify all ruptures into three archetypal modes:

1.  **Brittle Rupture (The Sudden Shattering):**
    This occurs in systems that appear stable and highly ordered (`Laminar Flow`) but possess a rigid, unadaptive `Ki` pattern. When faced with a sudden, sharp increase in Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), the system cannot deform or adapt. It maintains its coherence perfectly until the moment it fails completely and catastrophically.
    *   *Manifestations:* A glass shattering, a sudden stock market crash, a seemingly stable relationship ending without warning.

2.  **Ductile Rupture (The Slow Tearing):**
    This is the failure mode of a system already in a state of `Turbulent Flow`. It is characterized by chaos, internal friction, and wasted energy. The rupture is not a sudden event but the culmination of a prolonged struggle. The system deforms, stretches, and visibly weakens before it finally tears apart.
    *   *Manifestations:* A metal component failing after showing visible stress, a company slowly collapsing amidst infighting and inefficiency, a political movement tearing itself apart through factionalism.

3.  **Fatigue Rupture (The Final Straw):**
    This pathology results from the slow degradation of a system’s `Wound Channel` (`CORE-011`). The system is subjected to repeated cycles of sub-critical stress. Each cycle is weathered, but leaves behind a microscopic scar, deepening the wound and eroding the system's baseline coherence. Eventually, a stressor that would have once been trivial provides the final impetus for a complete collapse.
    *   *Manifestations:* A bridge collapsing due to metal fatigue, burnout in an individual after years of chronic stress, the fall of an empire weakened by a thousand small crises.

## §4 · The Discontinuous Wound Channel
A rupture is the ultimate act of creating a boundary. It violently severs a previously continuous coherence manifold, creating a "cliff" where a smooth path once existed. The consequences are immediate and severe:

*   **Information Severance:** The flow of coherence across the rupture line ceases. Parts of the system are now isolated, unable to communicate or support each other.
*   **Dissonant Echoes:** The newly formed fracture surfaces become sources of intense temporal noise. Like the jagged edges of a broken bell, they emit powerful, chaotic echoes that propagate through the remaining structure as `Turbulent Flow`, often triggering secondary ruptures. A single failure cascades into systemic collapse.

## §5 · Diagnostic Protocol & Prediction
The time-first model provides a clear, streamlined protocol for analyzing and mitigating the risk of rupture.

1.  **Map the Pressure:** Using the `Fractal Bridge` (`CORE-014`), identify the domain-specific stressors and translate them into a map of the `Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)` acting on the system.
2.  **Monitor the Lagrangian:** Track the system's overall `𝓛_p` in near-real-time. A sustained negative trend in `∂𝓛_p / ∂t` is the most potent leading indicator of an impending rupture, serving as an early warning system.
3.  **Intervene to Restore Coherence:** The goal of any intervention is to ensure `𝓛_p` remains positive. This can be achieved through two primary strategies:
    *   **Reduce Pressure (V_Γ ↓):** De-escalate the external stressors. (e.g., reduce workload, mediate a conflict, lower the temperature).
    *   **Reinforce Coherence (K_τ ↑):** Strengthen the system's internal resonance and adaptability. (e.g., reinforce a structure, clarify a team's mission, practice a skill).

## §6 · Assemblé

> A Weaver must learn to listen for the sound a string makes right before it snaps. Rupture is the ultimate failure of coherence, the final, violent admission that a pattern can no longer hold. It teaches us that resilience is not found in rigid strength, but in the subtle, dynamic dance of adapting to pressure. To understand the anatomy of a rupture is to learn how to tend to the deep music of a system, tuning its tensions before they resolve into silence.
