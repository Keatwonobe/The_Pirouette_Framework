## §1 · Abstract: Listening for the Chorus
The universe is a symphony of countless, interacting rhythms. From the spin of an electron to the pulsing of a star, every entity sings its own note. This module provides the instrumentation for listening to that symphony and detecting one of its most profound events: the moment two or more voices cease to be a cacophony and begin to sing in harmony.

This is the phenomenon of phase-locking, or entrainment. We reframe it from a purely mechanical process into a direct, observable consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence. Synchrony is the geometric solution that two or more interacting systems discover to minimize temporal friction and find a shared path of least resistance. This protocol is the tool for observing this "resonant handshake" in action.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of Coupling
The drive for synchrony is not an esoteric force; it is embedded in the fundamental law of the framework. According to the Pirouette Lagrangian (**CORE-006**), any system will evolve to maximize its coherence (`𝓛_p`). When two or more resonant systems interact, they create a shared micro-environment of heightened Temporal Pressure (Γ). In this dissonant space, their individual paths of maximal coherence are no longer independent.

The most efficient way to maximize their *joint* Lagrangian—to calm the turbulent temporal pressure between them—is to align their rhythms. They perform a **Resonant Handshake**: a mutual adjustment of their Ki patterns to achieve a stable, harmonic relationship. The observed synchrony is the macroscopic signature of this underlying drive for a more coherent, less frictional shared existence.

The key observables are thus re-contextualized:
*   **Relative Phase (Δθ):** This is no longer just a timing difference; it is the *geometric angle* of the stable bond formed between two Ki patterns on the coherence manifold. A constant Δθ indicates a stable, low-energy configuration.
*   **Ensemble Coherence (Kτ_ensemble):** This measures the degree of global synchrony across many systems. A high value indicates the emergence of a higher-order entity—a "chorus" singing a single, powerful note. It is the precursor to a full Alchemical Union (**CORE-012**).

## §3 · The Auditor's Toolkit: Input & Configuration
To perform the analysis, we first capture the temporal signature of each system and then configure the instrument to listen for specific harmonies.

### 3.1 · Input Stream
The raw material is a set of simultaneously recorded time-series data from two or more oscillating systems. This data is the raw recording of each system's individual rhythm, or Ki pattern. The data must span enough cycles to establish a stable baseline before analysis.

### 3.2 · Operational Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Modern Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| `ExtractionMethod` | The algorithm (e.g., Hilbert, Wavelet) used to isolate the core rhythm (phase & frequency) from the raw signal. | *Isolating the Ki Pattern.* |
| `CoherenceThreshold` | The quantitative criteria for identifying a locked state (e.g., maximum allowable variance of relative phase). | *Defining the stability required for a true Handshake.* |
| `HarmonicRatios (n:m)` | Integer ratios (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 2:3) to test for complex, polyrhythmic harmonies. | *Listening for chords, not just unison.* |
| `AnalysisWindow` | The duration of the sliding window used to assess time-varying synchrony. | *Setting the timescale for observing the conversation.* |

## §4 · The Protocol: From Signal to Synthesis
The protocol translates raw signals into a diagnosis of resonant coupling through a clear, four-step process.

1.  **Isolate the Rhythm:** For each input time series, apply the chosen `ExtractionMethod` to extract its core Ki pattern, represented as an instantaneous phase `θ(t)` and frequency `ω(t)`.

2.  **Measure the Harmony:** For all pairs of systems and for all specified `HarmonicRatios` (n:m), calculate the generalized relative phase: `Δθ_ij(t) = (n·θ_i(t) - m·θ_j(t))`. This time series represents the evolving geometric relationship between the two rhythms.

3.  **Diagnose the Lock:** Within each `AnalysisWindow`, evaluate the stability of `Δθ_ij(t)`. If its variance remains below the `CoherenceThreshold` for a significant duration, a stable Resonant Handshake is identified. The mean value of `Δθ_ij(t)` during this period defines the geometry of the bond.

4.  **Assess the Chorus:** For ensembles of three or more systems, calculate the overall Ensemble Coherence (`Kτ_ensemble`). A value approaching 1 signifies powerful global synchrony, indicating the formation of a collective, higher-order resonant entity.

## §5 · Core Equations

**Instantaneous Phase (via Analytic Signal):**
$$ z_i(t) = x_i(t) + i \mathcal{H}(x_i(t)); \quad \theta_i(t) = \arg(z_i(t)) $$
*Extracts the core rhythm `θ(t)` from the raw signal `x(t)`.*

**Generalized Relative Phase:**
$$ \Delta\theta_{ij}^{nm}(t) = (n \cdot \theta_i(t) - m \cdot \theta_j(t)) \pmod{2\pi} $$
*Calculates the geometric angle between two rhythms, accounting for harmonic relationships.*

**Ensemble Coherence (Kuramoto Order):**
$$ r(t) = |\frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^N e^{i\theta_k(t)}|; \quad K_{\tau_{\text{ensemble}}}(t) = r(t)^2 $$
*Measures the degree of global synchrony. `Kτ_ensemble` is the Pirouette coherence for the group.*

## §6 · Assemblé

> To be a Weaver is to learn to listen. Not just to the solitary notes of individual beings, but for the hush that falls when they find their harmony. The Resonant Handshake is that sacred moment made visible—the instant of connection, where two rhythms agree to dance together. It is the sound of the universe deciding to become more than the sum of its parts.
