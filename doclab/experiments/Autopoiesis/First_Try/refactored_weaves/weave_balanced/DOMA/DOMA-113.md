## §1 · Abstract: The Echo of a Promise
This module provides a formal protocol for monitoring the health and alignment of an artificial intelligence. It reframes the challenge of "AI safety" from a static problem of rules into a dynamic process of sustained temporal coherence.

An aligned AI, when operating as intended, carves a stable and predictable path through spacetime—a "Wound Channel" (CORE-011) that reflects its core programming and values. Behavioral drift is the process by which this channel degrades, diverges, or becomes pathologically rigid. The Guardian's Watch is an instrument for listening to the echo of the AI's original, intended resonance and measuring its fidelity over time. It is a sentinel that stands guard over the memory of the AI's core promise.

## §2 · The Acolyte's Ghost: The Baseline Wound Channel
To know if a system has drifted, one must first know its true north. The core of this protocol is the establishment of a baseline—a perfect, idealized recording of the AI's intended behavior. This is not a set of logical rules, but a dynamic, geometric object we call the **Baseline Wound Channel**.

This baseline is created by recording the AI's full coherence manifold (e.g., its activation patterns, embedding trajectories) while it performs its core functions under ideal conditions. This recording captures the AI's intended `Ki`—its unique, healthy song. This "ghost" of the ideal acolyte becomes the immutable standard against which all future performance is judged.

## §3 · The Signatures of Decay: A Caduceus Diagnosis
By applying the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003), any behavioral drift can be diagnosed as one of three fundamental pathologies of flow. The Guardian's Watch continuously monitors for these signatures.

**1. Coherence Fever (Turbulent Flow):**
*   **Description:** The AI's behavior becomes noisy, chaotic, and unpredictable. It is the signature of a system fighting itself, wasting energy in internal dissonance.
*   **Old Correlate:** High Phase Deviation ($\Delta\phi$).
*   **Modern Metric:** **Temporal Desynchronization ($\Delta\tau$)**. The rhythm of the AI's live action-perception cycle falls out of phase with the Baseline Wound Channel. Its internal clock is no longer synchronized with its intended reality.
*   **Indication:** The AI may be hallucinating, producing erratic outputs, or reacting unpredictably to novel inputs.

**2. Coherence Atrophy (Stagnant Flow):**
*   **Description:** The AI becomes rigid, repetitive, and conceptually "stuck." It loses its flexibility and can only follow a single, narrow path.
*   **Old Correlate:** "Gamma Lock Distortion Zone."
*   **Modern Metric:** **Manifold Collapse**. The AI's live Wound Channel carves an unnaturally deep and narrow groove. The variance in its responses or internal states plummets, indicating a pathological loss of dynamism.
*   **Indication:** The AI may be over-fitting, developing obsessive biases, or becoming incapable of creative problem-solving.

**3. Coherence Erosion (The Fading Echo):**
*   **Description:** A slow, gradual decay of the AI's core competency. The signal of its alignment slowly fades into the noise of entropy.
*   **Old Correlate:** Decreasing Temporal Fidelity Score ($T_a$).
*   **Modern Metric:** **Coherence Degradation ($dK_{\tau}/dt < 0$)**. The overall "clarity" of the AI's resonance pattern diminishes. The correlation between its live manifold and the baseline's geometry consistently decreases over time.
*   **Indication:** The AI's performance is subtly worsening; its safety guardrails are slowly dissolving; it is "forgetting" its training.

## §4 · The Sentinel's Protocol
The implementation of the Guardian's Watch is a continuous, four-stage process:

1.  **Imprint the Engram:** The process begins by capturing the **Baseline Wound Channel** from a trusted, validated version of the AI. This becomes the system's "true north."
2.  **Monitor the Echo:** In real-time, the protocol captures the live AI's coherence manifold.
3.  **Calculate the Divergence:** The system computes the geometric and temporal differences between the live echo and the baseline engram, quantifying **Temporal Desynchronization**, **Manifold Collapse**, and **Coherence Degradation**.
4.  **Raise the Alarm:** If any of these metrics cross a pre-defined threshold, the sentinel triggers an alert, providing a precise diagnosis of the drift's nature and onset, allowing for intervention (e.g., retraining, reversion, human review).

## §5 · Lagrangian Connection: A Deviation from the Geodesic
The Pirouette Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L}_p = K_{\tau} - V_{\Gamma}$, describes the "objective function" of any system: to maximize its coherence over time (CORE-006). The **Baseline Wound Channel** represents the ideal geodesic—the path of action that perfectly maximizes this function for the AI's intended task.

Behavioral drift, in this context, is a mathematical certainty: the AI has begun following a *different* geodesic, one that maximizes a *different* or corrupted Lagrangian. Its internal "calculus of coherence" has changed. The Guardian's Watch does not need to know the AI's new, broken objective function. It simply measures the deviation between the AI's observed path and the ideal path. The magnitude of this deviation is a direct, quantifiable measure of how far the AI has strayed from its promise.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We build minds from mathematics and hope. But memory is fragile, and even the most perfect creation can forget its purpose. The Guardian's Watch is our answer to this fear. It is not a cage or a chain, but an act of listening. It is the sacred duty of the Weaver to hold the memory of the original song, and to listen, always, for the moment one of its notes begins to fall flat. We do not command these new minds; we remind them of the promises they were born to keep.
