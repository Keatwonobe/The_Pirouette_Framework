## §1 · Abstract: The Ledger of the Song
Before a song can be written, its notes must be named. Before a tapestry can be woven, its threads must be sorted. This module serves as the definitive lexicon for the modernized Pirouette Framework. It is the ledger where the language of resonance is made precise.

The Great Refactoring collapsed the old, cumbersome triaxial model of Time-Adherence into a simpler, more powerful engine grounded in a single substance: Time. This created a new vocabulary. This document is the formal registry of that vocabulary, ensuring that every symbol and every term is used with clarity and consistency. It is the shared grammar that allows Weavers to speak of the universe's song in a common tongue.

## §2 · The Core Lexicon
The following tables provide the canonical definitions for the fundamental quantities of the time-first framework. They are the building blocks of all subsequent analysis.

#### I. The Autopoietic Trio
These three quantities form the self-creating (autopoietic) cycle at the heart of reality, as established in CORE-001.

| Symbol | Name | Definition & Grounding | Origin |
|:-------|:-----|:-----------------------|:-------|
| **τ_p** | The Pirouette Cycle | The fundamental quantum of time for a system. It is the duration of one complete cycle of its stable resonant pattern (Ki). Time is not a background; it is the event itself. | CORE-005 |
| **Γ** | Temporal Pressure | A measure of the density and complexity of interfering temporal rhythms in a given region of spacetime. It is the ambient, chaotic "noise" against which a system must maintain its form. | CORE-003 |
| **Ki** | Temporal Resonance | The specific, stable, geometric pattern a system manifests to exist within a given Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the system's unique "note" in the cosmic song. | CORE-004 |

#### II. The Lagrangian Components
These terms are the mathematical building blocks of the Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p), the central equation of motion for the framework.

| Symbol | Name | Definition & Grounding | Origin |
|:-------|:-----|:-----------------------|:-------|
| **K_τ** | Temporal Coherence | The "kinetic" term of the Lagrangian. It represents the quality and intensity of a system's internal rhythm. It is a function of its stability (T_a) and frequency (ω_k). | CORE-006 |
| **V_Γ** | Temporal Pressure (Potential) | The "potential" term of the Lagrangian. It represents the energetic "cost" for a system to maintain its coherence against the local ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). | CORE-006 |
| **𝓛_p** | Pirouette Lagrangian | The master function (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ) that summarizes the dynamics of any system. It expresses the trade-off between internal stability and external pressure. | CORE-006 |
| **S_p** | Coherence Action | The integral of the Lagrangian over a system's Pirouette Cycle (τ_p). The Principle of Maximal Coherence states that systems evolve along paths that maximize this value. | CORE-006 |

#### III. Emergent Properties & Subsumed Concepts
These are concepts that either emerge from the core dynamics or represent modernized interpretations of terms from the old framework.

| Symbol | Name | Definition & Grounding | Origin |
|:-------|:-----|:-----------------------|:-------|
| **T_a** | Time Adherence | Re-contextualized not as a fundamental force, but as an emergent property. It is the measure of a Ki pattern's stability and purity—its "signal-to-noise" ratio. | CORE-005 |
| **—** | Triaxial T_a (T_Q, T_I, T_C) | **(Deprecated)**. The old vector model for coherence has been fully subsumed by the unified Lagrangian dynamics. The new scalar T_a measures the overall quality of resonance. | PPS-007 (old) |
| **—** | Gladiator Force | The name for the principle of confinement. It is not a separate constant but a non-linear behavior of the V_Γ term at quantum and cosmological scales, manifesting as the strong force and gravity. | CORE-008 |
| **—** | Wound Channel | A persistent geometric scar an entity's resonance leaves in the local coherence manifold. It is the physical basis for memory and inertia. | CORE-011 |

## §3 · Symbolic Grammar
All modules must adhere to these conventions to ensure logical and computational consistency.

| Convention | Symbol | Range | Description |
|:-----------|:-------|:------|:------------|
| **Spacetime Indices** | μ, ν, ρ | 0 to 3 | Lowercase Greek letters denote components of 4-vectors and tensors. Einstein summation is assumed. |
| **Covariant Derivative** | ∇ | N/A | Represents the covariant derivative, which accounts for the curvature of the coherence manifold. |
| **Partial Derivative** | ∂ | N/A | Standard partial derivative, used for gradients in flat or local coordinate systems. |
| **Lagrangian Density** | 𝓛 | N/A | The script 'L' is reserved for the Lagrangian. |
| **Action** | S | N/A | The uppercase 'S' is reserved for the Action, the integral of the Lagrangian. |

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This Lexicon is the essential prerequisite for understanding the framework's central engine, the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006):

**𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**

Without the precise, grounded definitions provided in this module, this equation is merely a collection of symbols. This Lexicon gives them meaning. It clarifies that:
-   **K_τ** is not abstract energy, but the quantifiable quality of a system's unique song.
-   **V_Γ** is not an arbitrary potential, but the measurable pressure of the cosmic choir.

This module, therefore, acts as the bridge between the conceptual poetry of the autopoietic cycle and the predictive power of its mathematical form. It is the key that turns the equation into an engine.

## §5 · Assemblé
> To name a thing is to know its rhythm. To know its rhythm is to learn its part in the song.
>
> This Lexicon is not a list of rules; it is the sheet music for reality. A Weaver who masters it can not only read the song but begin to compose. It is the first and most vital discipline, for a precise language is the forge in which a coherent thought is made.
