summary: Provides a universal diagnostic protocol for assessing systemic health. It
  reframes health as a state of robust, laminar flow of coherence (energy, information,
  resources) and defines pathology in terms of flow disruptions. This module introduces
  the Caduceus Lens as the primary tool for diagnosing and facilitating systemic well-being,
  replacing the heuristic lexicon of PPS-082.

## §1 · The Physician's New Oath

The master physician does not fight disease. They cultivate health.

The old framework, in PPS-082, began the vital work of translating clinical data into a human story. It built a bridge from facts to narrative. The modern framework rebuilds that bridge on a stronger foundation. We move beyond a lexicon of discrete dynamics (`Spasm`, `Snap`, `Fracture`) to a unified theory of systemic flow.

Health is not an absence of pathology; it is the *presence* of efficient, stable, and adaptive laminar flow. A system is healthy when its vital currents—of energy, information, resources, and meaning—move without obstruction or friction. Disease, therefore, is not an invading entity to be fought, but a disruption in flow to be understood and restored. The Caduceus Lens is the formal instrument for viewing reality through this principle. It is the diagnostic core of the refactored framework.

## §2 · The Three Pathologies of Flow

Any ailment in any system, from a patient to a society, can be diagnosed as one of three fundamental pathologies of coherence. These map directly to the flow states defined in Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001) and replace the more granular lexicon of the past.

**Coherence Atrophy (The Stagnant Dam):**

*   **Description:** This pathology arises from a blockage in a critical flow, leading to a "coherence desert" downstream and a dangerous pressure build-up upstream. It is the "poison of absence."
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** A state of **Stagnant Flow**. A vital piece of information or a necessary resource is not reaching its destination.
*   **Manifestations:** A blocked artery in an organism; a critical supply chain failure in an economy; a repressed trauma in a psyche; a team waiting on a single decision-maker.

**Coherence Fever (The Turbulent Storm):**

*   **Description:** A state of systemic dissonance where the system is fighting itself. Energy is wasted in chaotic, internal friction instead of being used for productive function. It is an "information storm."
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** A state of **Turbulent Flow**. The system's Ki has become internally dissonant, creating destructive interference patterns.
*   **Manifestations:** An autoimmune disorder in an organism; a market crash fueled by panic in an economy; a debilitating anxiety attack in a psyche; a team plagued by infighting and conflicting goals.

**Coherence Erosion (The Fraying Thread):**

*   **Description:** The slow, gradual degradation of a system's core resonant pattern. The system loses its memory, its form, and its ability to self-correct.
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** A failure of the **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) to maintain the system's Ki against the constant pressure of entropy, as described in CORE-013.
*   **Manifestations:** Chronic degenerative disease or aging in an organism; the slow decay of infrastructure in a city; the loss of cultural identity in a society; the fading of a skill through disuse.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Protocol: Applying the Lens

To diagnose a system is to read the state of its rivers. The Caduceus Lens provides a four-step protocol for moving from symptom to solution, preserving the intent of PPS-082 with greater clarity.

1.  **Map the Currents:** Identify the critical flows of coherence that define the system's life. What must move for the system to be healthy? (e.g., blood, nerve signals, capital, data, trust).
2.  **Identify the Pathology:** Observe the currents. Where is the flow effortless and efficient (Laminar)? Where is it chaotic (Turbulent)? Where is it blocked (Stagnant)? This initial observation identifies the primary symptom.
3.  **Locate the Source:** The true diagnosis is not the symptom but its origin. Trace the disrupted flow back to its source. What specific "dam" is causing the stagnation? What "dissonant injection" is creating the turbulence? What external pressure is accelerating the erosion?
4.  **The Daedalus Gambit (The Principle of Intervention):** A wise intervention is not a brute-force attack but a clever, precise, and minimal action designed to restore the system's own ability to self-regulate. This is the **Daedalus Gambit**.
    *   For **Atrophy**, the gambit is to introduce the precise "key" that dissolves the dam—a catalyst, a missing nutrient, a critical piece of information.
    *   For **Fever**, the gambit is to introduce a "harmonizing signal"—a coherent rhythm that the turbulent system can latch onto, like a tuning fork, to find its way back to laminar flow.
    *   For **Erosion**, the gambit is to "reinforce the channel"—to provide support, structure, and repetition that helps the system remember its healthy pattern and strengthen its memory against decay.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This diagnostic model is a direct, practical application of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). The Principle of Maximal Coherence states that a system will naturally evolve along the path that maximizes its coherence.

*   A **healthy system** is one successfully navigating its geodesic, maintaining a state of high coherence (Laminar Flow). Its Lagrangian is maximized.
*   A **diseased system** is one that has been knocked off its geodesic. The pathologies of Atrophy, Fever, and Erosion are descriptions of *why* a system is failing to maximize its coherence.
*   An **intervention (Daedalus Gambit)** is a targeted action designed to alter the system's local "coherence manifold," making the healthy geodesic once again the path of least resistance. It is an act of helping the system find its way back to its own optimal state.

## §5 · The Assemblé

> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver?
>
> The Caduceus Lens reveals a profound truth: every system is a body. Every corporation, every ecosystem, every line of code, and every society has a physiology. It has currents that must flow, a form that must be maintained, and a health that can be cultivated.
>
> To apply this lens is to move from the role of a mechanic, who replaces broken parts, to that of a physician, who understands that the whole is a living, breathing, and deeply interconnected conversation. The ultimate dare of the framework is met here: it provides the tools not just to analyze, but to heal.
