## §1 · Abstract: Seeing the Loom in the Threads

A system's true nature is rarely visible in a single observation. We see shadows on the cave wall—a 2D sensor slice, a single data point, a momentary state. This module provides the instrumentation to step out of the cave and see the fire. The Gyroid Loom is a computational protocol that takes sparse, 2D observations and infers the full, three-dimensional coherence manifold of the system under study.

It is founded on a key insight: under pressure, many complex systems—from plasma instabilities to biological tissues—naturally organize into a gyroid geometry. This is not an accident; the gyroid is one of nature's most elegant solutions to the problem of maximizing coherence. This tool transforms tomographic reconstruction from a simple act of stacking images into a profound act of inferring a system's chosen solution for existence.

## §2 · The Physical Basis: A Geometry of Maximal Coherence

Why do gyroids appear so often? In the Pirouette Framework, a gyroid is not merely a shape; it is the physical manifestation of a system successfully solving for its own survival. It is a stable, persistent Ki pattern (a resonant geometry, as defined in CORE-004) that represents a deeply optimized solution to the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**.

**Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006):**
The Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`, dictates that a system will evolve along a path that maximizes its own internal stability against external chaotic pressure. A gyroid is a triply periodic minimal surface. Its geometry is an expression of maximal efficiency—it provides immense surface area and structural integrity for minimal energetic cost.

A system that adopts a gyroidal Ki has found a profound "sweet spot" in the landscape of the Lagrangian. It has woven itself into a form that maximizes its internal coherence (`Kτ`) while expertly navigating and dissipating the external Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). This tool is designed to find that form.

## §3 · The Reconstruction Protocol: From Slices to Manifold

The Gyroid Loom is a computational pipeline that translates observational data into a full 3D model of the system's resonant Ki pattern.

| Step | Modern Function | Description & Method |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Observational Projection** | Translate 2D slices into angular projections. | Each 2D data slice (`magnetogram`, `micro-CT`, etc.) is transformed into a sinogram using a Radon-FFT method. This converts spatial information into a format that reveals the system's underlying rotational and radial symmetries. |
| **Temporal Coordinate Mapping** | Map projections onto a helical time-space. | The stack of sinograms is unwound onto helical coordinates. This crucial step reframes the spatial stack as a single, continuous, spiraling history, treating the `z-axis` as a proxy for the system's temporal evolution or resonant phase. |
| **Coherence Manifold Solver** | Solve for the most probable Ki geometry. | Using the mapped data as boundary conditions, the engine solves for the underlying coherence manifold (`ψ`). It iteratively fits a gyroidal solution by finding a stable state for the system's Lagrangian. This is the heart of the process: finding the geometry that best explains the sparse data as a path of maximal coherence. |
| **Ki Manifold Export** | Generate the 3D resonant geometry. | The final, solved coherence manifold (`ψ`) is exported as a 3D mesh (e.g., STL file via marching cubes) and a full 3D field map. This map allows for the direct calculation of derived properties like local coherence (`Kτ`) and temporal pressure (`Γ`). |

## §4 · Diagnostic Metrics: Gauging Systemic Health

The output of the Loom is not just a picture; it is a diagnostic report on the system's health, directly linking to the principles of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001).

| Metric | Description | Diagnostic Insight |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Manifold Coherence (`Kτ_manifold`)** | Measures how closely the reconstructed geometry fits an ideal, mathematically perfect gyroid. A value near 1.0 indicates a perfect fit. | A high value signifies a system in a state of healthy **Laminar Flow**. A low value suggests internal friction, damage, or **Turbulent Flow**. A progressive drop over time indicates **Coherence Erosion**. |
| **Observational Fidelity** | The normalized root-mean-square error between the reconstructed 3D manifold and the original 2D input slices. | Measures the confidence of the reconstruction. High error may indicate the input data is too sparse, too noisy, or that the system is not, in fact, gyroidal. |
| **Pressure Gradient (`∇Γ`)** | The variance of the temporal pressure across the manifold. | High variance can pinpoint locations of **Stagnant Flow** or blockages, revealing structural weaknesses or points of imminent failure. |

## §5 · Application Domains: From Plasma to Bone

The Gyroid Loom is a scale-invariant tool for bridging theory and observation across numerous fields:

*   **Plasma Physics:** Reconstructs the complex, helical coherence manifolds of magnetically confined plasmas, revealing the hidden geometry of the Gladiator Force's arena and predicting the onset of instabilities.
*   **Materials Science:** Maps the internal porous structures of advanced materials and biological tissues (like trabecular bone), revealing the flow channels for stress, heat, and nutrients.
*   **Astrophysics:** Infers the 3D magnetic field structure of stellar atmospheres from 2D magnetograms, mapping the resonant architecture that governs solar flares and coronal mass ejections.

> ### The Assemblé
>
> We sought to map the shape of things and found instead the architecture of their survival. The gyroid is the loom upon which a system weaves its own being, a silent testament to a battle won against the ceaseless pressure of chaos. It is the frozen music of a system holding its note perfectly. To a Weaver, this tool matters because it allows us to see this music. It gives us the power to look at the faintest of shadows and infer the magnificent, resonant form that casts them, turning us from mere observers into true diagnosticians of a system's hidden, geometric soul.
