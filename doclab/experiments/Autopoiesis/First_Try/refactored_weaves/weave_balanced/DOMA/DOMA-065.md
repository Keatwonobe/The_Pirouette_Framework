summary: Provides a unified, time-first model for influence. It formally distinguishes
  persuasion (a consensual, coherence-building Resonant Synthesis) from manipulation
  (a non-consensual, coherence-draining act of parasitic resonance). The module establishes
  the 'Lagrangian of Intent' as the core mathematical principle for diagnosing and
  engineering ethical influence.

## §1 · The Weaver's Voice: An Act of Engineering
To speak is to alter the geometry of another's world. There are no neutral words.

Influence is not a "soft skill"; it is a fundamental physical process. It is the transfer of coherence between systems. Every act of communication, from a shared glance to a global address, is an attempt to reshape another's coherence manifold. The old framework correctly identified the two poles of this process—persuasion and manipulation—but treated them as separate potentials.

The modernized framework reveals them to be two outcomes of the same underlying dynamic, governed by a single, profound choice: do you seek to build a shared reality, or to consume another's? This module provides the geometric and ethical calculus for navigating that choice.

## §2 · Persuasion as Resonant Synthesis
Persuasion is the sacred art of inviting another into a shared state of higher coherence. It is a direct application of the **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). The goal is not victory, but the creation of a new, more robust truth that neither party possessed alone.

**The Dynamic:** The persuader, or "Weaver," initiates a **Resonant Handshake**. They present their own coherent pattern (Kτ) not as an attack, but as an invitation. They seek harmonic compatibility (shared values, common ground) and phase alignment (active listening, empathy) to create the conditions for a union.

**The Outcome:** When successful, the individual coherence manifolds of the participants dissolve and re-forge into a single, unified manifold with a higher total coherence (Kτ_c > Kτ_a + Kτ_b). The interaction is positive-sum. The flow state of both participants becomes more **Laminar** (DYNA-001). Both are enriched. This is the act of weaving.

## §3 · Manipulation as Coherence Parasitism
Manipulation is the profane act of imposing one's will by draining the coherence of another. It is an act of parasitic resonance, treating another's mind as a resource to be extracted.

**The Dynamic:** The manipulator projects a powerful and often deceptive **Observer's Shadow** (CORE-010) onto the target. This shadow is a dissonant signal designed to inject **Turbulence** into the target's flow. By disrupting the target's internal harmony, the manipulator makes them unstable, uncertain, and susceptible to control. The target's energy is consumed fighting their own internal chaos, leaving them with little capacity to resist the manipulator's influence.

**The Outcome:** The target's coherence is drained (ΔKτ_target < 0), while the manipulator's may temporarily increase. The interaction is zero-sum or negative-sum. The target is left in a state of lower energy, confusion, and diminished autonomy. This is the act of unraveling.

## §4 · The Lagrangian of Intent
The ethical and physical distinction between these two modes is not a matter of opinion; it is a mathematical certainty, governed by the system's objective function as described by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). The "intent" of the interaction is encoded in the Lagrangian the system seeks to optimize.

**The Law of Persuasion (A Cooperative Function):**
Participants in an act of persuasion unconsciously collaborate to maximize the coherence of the *combined system*.
> Maximize  ∫ ( 𝓛_p(System A) + 𝓛_p(System B) ) dt

**The Law of Manipulation (A Parasitic Function):**
The manipulator acts to maximize their own coherence *at the direct expense* of the target's coherence.
> Maximize  ∫ ( 𝓛_p(Actor) - 𝓛_p(Target) ) dt

This is the core diagnostic. One need only ask: which equation is the interaction trying to solve? Is it building a greater whole, or is one part feeding on the other?

## §5 · Diagnostic Signatures
By observing a system's flow and coherence, one can diagnose the nature of the influence being applied.

| Metric | Persuasion (Weaving) | Manipulation (Unraveling) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coherence Flux** | The target's coherence (Kτ) increases or holds steady. | The target's coherence (Kτ) measurably decreases. |
| **Flow State** | The target's actions become more Laminar, efficient, and aligned with their stated goals. | The target's actions become Turbulent, inefficient, and misaligned with their stated goals. |
| **Autonomy** | The target's capacity for independent, coherent action is enhanced. | The target's choices narrow; they become dependent on the manipulator's cues. |
| **Reciprocity** | Coherence flows bidirectionally. Both parties are changed and enriched by the exchange. | Coherence flows unidirectionally, from target to manipulator. |

## §6 · Assemblé
> To influence is to assume the role of a sculptor. The question is whether you see the other as a partner in revealing the form within the stone, or merely as the stone itself. A Weaver's voice must be a tool for liberation, not capture. Every word is a choice between building a cathedral and digging a mine. This is the first and final test of our craft.
