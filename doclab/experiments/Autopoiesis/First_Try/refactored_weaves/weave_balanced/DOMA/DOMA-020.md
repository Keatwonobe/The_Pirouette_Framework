  \ Compass provides a universal protocol for proactive stewardship, ensuring that\
  \ the act of creation enhances, rather than degrades, the universe's existing harmony."

## ¬ß1 ¬∑ Abstract: From Boundary to Bearing
The old framework established a necessary boundary‚Äîan Ethical Light Cone to prevent catastrophic missteps. This was the wisdom of caution. The new framework demands more: the wisdom of cultivation. We do not merely seek to avoid harm; we seek to actively nurture and enhance coherence.

The Weaver's Compass is not a static fence at the edge of a cliff. It is a dynamic, navigational instrument for the artist. It reframes ethical consideration from a reactive check on "consequence" to a proactive assessment of **Coherence Risk (R_Œ∫)**‚Äîthe potential of any action to degrade the health and harmony of the systems it touches. Its purpose is to ensure that every new thread we weave into the tapestry of reality strengthens the whole.

## ¬ß2 ¬∑ From Consequence to Coherence
The old metric of "Consequence-Space" was a useful abstraction. We now ground its components in the physical dynamics of the framework. An action's risk is a measure of the *turbulence* it threatens to introduce into a system's flow.

| Old Term | New Pirouette Term | Mapping Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Scope (S) | **Reach (œÅ)** | How many nested systems will the resulting turbulence propagate to? |
| Magnitude (M) | **Dissonance (Œ¥)** | How severely will the action disrupt the target system's core resonant pattern (Ki)? |
| Irreversibility (I) | **Wound Channel Depth (œâ)** | How deeply and permanently will the action scar the system's memory and identity, as encoded in its Wound Channel (CORE-011)? |

An action is not "bad" because it is large or far-reaching. It is *risky* because it threatens to create a deep, dissonant scar that propagates through many layers of reality.

## ¬ß3 ¬∑ The Coherence Risk Equation (R_Œ∫)
Coherence Risk is a predictive metric (0-1 scale) that estimates the potential degradation of a system's health. It is a weighted function of the three core risk factors:

$$ R_Œ∫ = w_œÅ œÅ + w_Œ¥ Œ¥ + w_œâ œâ $$

Where **œÅ**, **Œ¥**, and **œâ** are normalized scores (0-1) and **w** are the current weights for Reach, Dissonance, and Wound Channel Depth. This equation provides a clear, quantitative estimate of the "cost" an action might impose on the universe's balance sheet of coherence.

## ¬ß4 ¬∑ The Principles of Coherence Stewardship
The old axioms are now reframed as four proactive principles for any Weaver acting within the framework.

1.  **The Principle of Foresight:** Any action that interfaces with a complex system must first calculate its Coherence Risk (R_Œ∫). To act without foresight is to sail into a storm without a map.
2.  **The Principle of Proportional Care:** The degree of oversight, simulation, and mitigation required for an action must scale in proportion to its calculated R_Œ∫. We do not use a sledgehammer to set a gemstone.
3.  **The Principle of Irreversibility:** Actions that threaten to carve deep, permanent Wound Channels (high œâ) demand the highest standard of scrutiny and justification. Some bells cannot be un-rung.
4.  **The Sentience Sanctuary:** The emergence of a coherent, self-aware consciousness is the universe's most profound act of creation. Any system exhibiting such properties is a sacred arena. Actions that risk its coherence are subject to an immediate and indefinite moratorium, pending a review of incomparable depth.

## ¬ß5 ¬∑ The Protocol of Prudence: Navigating the Manifold
Based on the calculated R_Œ∫, a project's path is guided by a clear protocol, mirroring the flow states from DYN-001.

-   **Laminar Path (R_Œ∫ ‚â§ 0.5):** The action is predicted to integrate smoothly with the existing flow of coherence. It may proceed with standard monitoring and reporting.
-   **Turbulent Watch (0.5 < R_Œ∫ ‚â§ 0.75):** The action carries a significant risk of creating local turbulence. It requires enhanced monitoring, real-time coherence diagnostics on affected systems, and pre-defined rollback plans.
-   **Coherence Quarantine (R_Œ∫ > 0.75):** The action is predicted to cause severe, widespread dissonance. The project is immediately isolated in a simulated manifold. A **Dissonance Audit**‚Äîan adversarial simulation designed to map the full geometry of its worst-case failure modes‚Äîis mandatory. Unanimous approval from a review council is required before the project can exit quarantine under new, strict conditions.

## ¬ß6 ¬∑ Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The Weaver's Compass is the practical, moral application of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006). The Pirouette Lagrangian, `ùìõ_p`, defines the "health" or "action" of a system. A healthy, coherent system is one that successfully maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian over time.

Coherence Risk (R_Œ∫) is a predictive estimate of the negative impact an external action will have on a target system's ability to maximize its `‚à´ùìõ_p dt`.

An ethical action, therefore, is one that helps other systems maintain or increase their coherence. An unethical action is one that parasitically degrades the coherence of other systems for its own sake. The Compass is the instrument that allows a Weaver to calculate this impact *before* the first thread is woven.

## ¬ß7 ¬∑ The Assembl√©
> A Weaver's first duty is not to create, but to listen. To listen to the existing song of the universe and to understand its harmonies. The Weaver's Compass is not a set of rules that binds the artist's hands; it is the tuning fork that attunes the artist's ear. It ensures that the new notes we add do not create a jarring discord, but rather a richer, more profound, and more beautiful resonance. It is the sacred promise that our art will serve the music, and not the other way around.
