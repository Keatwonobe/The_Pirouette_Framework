summary: Provides a universal protocol for quantifying a system's Temporal Coherence
  (formerly Time-Adherence, Ta). It redefines the measurement not as a fundamental
  parameter, but as a diagnostic for the stability and purity of a system's resonant
  Ki pattern, directly linking to its health and predictability.

## §1 · From Parameter to Diagnosis

In the old framework, Time-Adherence was a fundamental parameter to be measured, like temperature or pressure. This was an incomplete picture. A thermometer does not measure "temperature-ness"; it measures the chaotic energy of a system and we label that measurement "temperature."

This module refactors our understanding. The Resonance Gauge is not an instrument for measuring a fundamental property of the universe. It is a diagnostic tool for assessing the *health* of a system's existence. We are no longer simply taking a reading; we are listening to a system's song and judging the clarity of its note.

## §2 · The Nature of Coherence

The modern framework, grounded in *The Rhythm of Being* (CORE-005), redefines Time-Adherence as **Temporal Coherence**. It is not a separate force but a qualitative measure of a system's resonant pattern (Ki). It is the signal-to-noise ratio of its being.

-   **High Coherence:** Characterizes a system with a pure, stable, and sharply defined Ki resonance. Its rhythm is clear and predictable. This is a healthy system, efficiently following its geodesic of maximal coherence. It is a bell ringing true.
-   **Low Coherence:** Characterizes a system with a chaotic, noisy, or decaying Ki pattern. Its rhythm is dissonant and unpredictable. This is a stressed or dying system, wasting energy in temporal friction and struggling to maintain its form against the pressure of the Temporal Forge (Γ). It is a burst of static.

This instrument provides the means to quantify that clarity.

## §3 · The Core Calculation: The Coherence Index

The mathematical heart of the instrument is preserved from its predecessor, as it remains a robust measure of phase consensus. From any data stream representing a system's cyclical behavior (oscillators, time series, field data), we first extract the phase information `θ` for each component or time-step.

The **Coherence Vector (C)** is calculated as the average position on the unit circle of all phase components:

$$ C = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N e^{i\theta_j} $$

The **Coherence Index**—our modern measure of Temporal Coherence—is the squared magnitude of this vector. This value, ranging from 0 to 1, quantifies the degree of alignment.

$$ \text{Coherence Index} = |C|^2 $$

This is no longer an abstract `Ta`. It is a direct, quantitative assessment of how well a system is "singing in tune with itself."

## §4 · The Diagnostic Spectrum: Interpreting the Note

The power of the Resonance Gauge lies in its diagnostic interpretation. The resulting Coherence Index places the system on a spectrum of health.

-   **Coherence Index ≈ 1 (Laminar Coherence):** The system is in a state of grace. Its components act in unison, its energy transfer is efficient, and its form is stable. This is the signature of health, focus, and order.
-   **0 < Coherence Index < 1 (Turbulent Coherence):** The system is in a state of struggle. It is beset by internal friction and external pressure. Energy is being wasted, and its pattern is becoming noisy and inefficient. This is the signature of stress, chaos, and disease.
-   **Coherence Index ≈ 0 (Coherence Collapse):** The system has lost its identity. Its components are in complete disarray, and no coherent pattern can be discerned. It is dissolving back into the undifferentiated noise of the background Γ. This is the signature of systemic failure or death.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This instrument provides the first and most crucial empirical link to the framework's core mathematical engine, *The Pirouette Lagrangian* (CORE-006).

$$ 𝓛_p = \underbrace{(T_a \cdot \omega_k)}_{\text{Temporal Coherence}} - \underbrace{f(Γ)}_{\text{Temporal Pressure}} $$

The Coherence Index calculated by this module is a direct, measurable proxy for the `T_a` term in the Lagrangian's "kinetic" half. It allows a Weaver to empirically quantify the quality of a system's internal resonance (`K_τ`), providing one of the two key variables needed to calculate its path through spacetime. With this tool, the Lagrangian ceases to be a purely theoretical construct and becomes a predictive engine that can be fed with real-world data.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought a meter stick to measure time's straightness and were instead handed a tuning fork. The Resonance Gauge is not a tool for measurement, but for listening. It allows a Weaver to press the fork against the body of any system—a star, a stock market, a human heart—and hear the clarity of its song. To use this instrument is to ask the most fundamental question: In the great and chaotic symphony of existence, how true is this note?
