summary: Re-frames communication as the projection of a Ki pattern (the Current) into
  the coherence manifold. Defines influence as the geometric stress this projection
  creates, and response (the Echo) as how other systems navigate this new landscape
  to maximize their own coherence.

## §1 · Abstract: Carving the Riverbed of Time
To exist is to resonate, and in resonating, to impress one's rhythm upon the fabric of reality. The original narrative of "The Singer and The Echo" captured the essence of this truth, but the time-first framework allows us to describe its physics with newfound precision.

This module refactors the act of communication from a simple call-and-response into a process of metaphysical engineering. Influence is not a wave traveling through a passive medium; it is the active carving of a new channel—a new potential path—into the shared coherence manifold. The response is not merely a sound returned; it is the choice of another system to navigate, ignore, or resist the new landscape you have just created.

## §2 · The Current: The Projection of Coherence
An entity's internal, stable resonance (its Ki) is its fundamental truth. To communicate is to project this pattern outward. We no longer call this a "song," but a **Current**: a directed flow of one's own coherence that impresses itself upon the local manifold.

This act has a physical consequence. As established in *The Anatomy of an Echo* (CORE-011), every action leaves a geometric trace. The Current of influence creates a **Wound Channel**—a persistent, topological feature in spacetime. The clarity and power of this channel are a direct function of the projecting entity's own temporal coherence (Kτ). A focused, coherent mind carves a deep and stable riverbed; a scattered mind creates a shallow, turbulent wash.

A true act of persuasion is therefore a gift of order: the creation of a stable, low-resistance path through a chaotic environment, making it easier for others to follow.

## §3 · The Echo: A Dialogue with Geometry
The response, or **Echo**, is how another entity's system interacts with the new geometry of the Current. This is not a passive reception of information, but an active, physical navigation. The response is governed by the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006): the entity will behave in a way that maximizes its own internal stability and minimizes the cost of existing in its environment. The Current has just changed the cost function.

The Echo reveals the listener's own internal state and its relationship to the new landscape. We can now define the taxonomy of response with greater physical clarity.

## §4 · A Taxonomy of Response
*   **Inertial Rejection (Silence):** The listener's own Wound Channel is deep and stable; its inertia is immense. The new Current is a minor perturbation, a trivial feature in a landscape dominated by the listener's own history and habits. To follow its own path remains the choice of maximal coherence. The invitation is ignored.
*   **Coherence Clash (Dissonance):** The listener's Ki is fundamentally disharmonious with the geometry of the Current. To follow this new path would dramatically *decrease* the listener's own coherence, creating destructive interference. The listener's system actively resists the new geometry to protect its own integrity. This is the physics of disagreement.
*   **Parasitic Resonance (Manipulation):** The listener couples with the Current but does not reciprocate. It uses the new channel to stabilize its own resonance, effectively drawing coherence from the singer's Wound Channel to reinforce its own, without contributing to a shared state. This is a geometric theft.
*   **Resonant Coupling (Harmony):** The singer's Current presents a path of *higher* coherence for the listener. The listener's system naturally and efficiently "locks on" to this new rhythm, as it represents a more stable, lower-energy state. This is the **Resonant Handshake** defined in *The Alchemical Union* (CORE-012), the prerequisite for true synthesis. The Echo returns as a harmonizing signal, and a shared, higher-order coherence is born.

## §5 · The Lagrangian of Dialogue
This entire process can be described by the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ). The singer's Current is an act that modifies the local Temporal Pressure term (V_Γ) for all nearby listeners. The Echo is the behavioral result of each listener's system solving for its new geodesic—its new path of maximal coherence—within this altered landscape. Resonance occurs when this new path leads to a higher integrated action (S_p) for both parties, a state of greater total coherence. Disagreement is a state where no such mutually beneficial path can be found.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We believed we were sending messages, words carried on the wind. The framework reveals a more profound and terrifying truth: we are not sending messages; we are carving riverbeds. Every act of expression, every argument, every declaration of love is a permanent alteration of the shared landscape of reality. The echo we receive is the sound of another soul choosing to walk in the world we have just made. A Weaver, then, is not merely a communicator. A Weaver is a world-builder, acutely aware that the furrows they leave in time become the paths or the prisons of the future.
