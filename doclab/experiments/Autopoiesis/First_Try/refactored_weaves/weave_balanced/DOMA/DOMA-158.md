summary: Provides the primary instrumentation for the Fractal Bridge. This module

## §1 · Abstract: Perceiving the Weaver's Hand
A falling stock market, a spike in viral infections, and the rise of a new political narrative may appear as separate events. The Resonant Loom is the instrument that allows a Weaver to see them as threads woven by the same hand.

This module operationalizes the Principle of Correspondence established in the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014). It replaces the brute-force statistical correlation of the old framework with a sophisticated, time-first protocol for detecting *isomorphism*—a shared rhythm, a single `Ki` pattern, that manifests simultaneously across different domains of reality. Its purpose is not merely to find patterns, but to reveal the hidden, higher-order systems that generate them.

## §2 · From Data to Dynamics: The Principle of Correspondence in Practice
The analysis is only possible because the universe is fractal. The same dynamics of coherence and pressure that shape a star also shape a society. The Resonant Loom is a protocol for translating the unique "language" of each domain into the universal grammar of the Pirouette Framework.

The output of this process is the **Coherence Tapestry**: a multi-layered, time-series visualization that shows where and when the chosen domains fall into and out of a shared rhythm. This is the modernized successor to the "Generalized Coherence Vector," transforming a static measure into a dynamic narrative of systemic influence.

## §3 · The Protocol: Four Steps to Weaving Insight

#### Step I: Choosing the Threads (Domain Selection)
The Weaver selects a set of two or more domains for analysis. These threads can be as diverse as the question demands.
-   **Example:** A Weaver investigating urban decay might choose threads from local economics (unemployment rates), public health (ER visits), infrastructure (power grid failures), and social media (sentiment analysis).

#### Step II: Dyeing the Threads (Variable Mapping)
Following the protocol of the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014), the Weaver translates the primary metrics from each domain into the core Pirouette variables. This is the crucial act of translation.
-   **Economic Thread:** Market Volatility → Temporal Pressure (Γ); Consumer Confidence → Coherence (Kτ).
-   **Health Thread:** Rate of new infections → Γ; Public health response time → Kτ.
-   **Social Thread:** Volume of negative sentiment → Γ; Prevalence of unifying narratives → Kτ.

#### Step III: Finding the Rhythm (Resonance Detection)
This is the heart of the Loom. The translated time-series data for each domain is analyzed not for correlation of amplitude, but for synchronization of phase and frequency. The engine searches for a persistent, shared temporal pattern—a common `ωk`—across the threads. This "master rhythm" is the signature of a single, underlying driver or a tightly coupled emergent system.

#### Step IV: Reading the Tapestry (Synthesis)
The final output is the Coherence Tapestry. It reveals:
-   **Periods of High Resonance:** Time windows where the domains moved in lockstep, indicating a powerful, unifying influence.
-   **Phase Leads and Lags:** Which domain acts as the "leading indicator," its rhythm shifting just before the others follow? This reveals the direction of causality.
-   **Resonance Breaks:** Moments where a thread "snaps" out of the shared pattern, signaling a decoupling, an external shock, or an act of systemic resistance.

## §4. Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The discovery of a shared rhythm across multiple domains is a profound physical statement. According to the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006), each system follows the geodesic—the path of least resistance—on its local coherence manifold.

When the Loom detects a shared resonance, it has found evidence that these disparate systems are navigating the *same geodesic*. This implies that a single, large-scale gradient in the coherence manifold is influencing all of them simultaneously. The threads are not just coincidentally similar; they are all flowing downhill along the same cosmic contour. This transforms the analysis from a descriptive tool into a predictive engine. By understanding the shape of this contour, a Weaver can anticipate the future path of the entire multi-domain system.

## §5 · Assemblé
> We were lost, watching the dance of individual puppets on a darkened stage, trying to understand each one's story in isolation. The Resonant Loom is the act of turning on the house lights. For the first time, we see the strings. We see they all rise to the hands of a single puppeteer. To a Weaver, this instrument does not just provide insight. It provides a target. It transforms the impossible task of calming a thousand separate storms into the manageable act of reasoning with the god of the wind.
