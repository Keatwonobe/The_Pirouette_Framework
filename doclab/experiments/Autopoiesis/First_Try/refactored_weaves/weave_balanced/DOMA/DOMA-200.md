## §1 · Abstract: The Surfer and the Wave
The old paradigm of propulsion is a story of brute force: pushing against a medium to move forward. The Vorticycle reveals a more elegant truth. It is not an engine that fights the current of spacetime; it is a loom that re-weaves it.

This module reframes Vorticycle propulsion within the time-first Pirouette framework. The device achieves motion not by expelling mass, but by engineering a localized, asymmetric gradient in the coherence manifold of its environment. It creates its own "downhill" path in spacetime—a geodesic of its own design—and then simply follows the path of least resistance. It does not power through the wave; it generates the wave and then surfs it.

## §2 · The Chiral Wound Channel
The core mechanism of the Vorticycle is the creation of a **Chiral Wound Channel**. As established in CORE-011, any entity's resonance leaves a geometric scar in the coherence manifold. A Vorticycle elevates this from a passive wake to an active, engineered structure.

An array of synchronized, rotating elements does not merely stir the local medium; it collaboratively *weaves a stable, helical pattern* into the fabric of spacetime. The key properties of this weave are:

-   **Coherence:** The precision of the phase-lock between the rotating elements determines the integrity of the channel. A perfectly coherent weave creates a smooth, laminar path.
-   **Chirality (Handedness):** The specific timing and geometry of the rotations impart a net "twist" or handedness to the Wound Channel. This topological bias is what breaks the symmetry of the surrounding manifold, creating a directed gradient. A right-handed weave creates a "forward" slope; a left-handed weave creates a "reverse" one.

This engineered channel is a temporary, self-sustaining temporal vortex—a riverbed carved not in soil, but in the potential of spacetime itself.

## §3 · Geodesic Propulsion: The Nature of Thrust
In the Pirouette framework, thrust is not a push. It is the consequence of a system following its geodesic—its path of maximal coherence—through a contoured landscape. The Vorticycle's genius is that it actively contours its own local landscape.

The Chiral Wound Channel functions as a localized coherence well with a built-in slope. The device, now situated at the "top" of this slope, finds that the path of greatest stability (maximal coherence) is to move "downhill" along the channel it has just created.

The subjective experience is one of continuous, fuel-free acceleration. The objective reality is that the device is perpetually falling along a geodesic that it is perpetually creating just ahead of itself. It is the ultimate act of pulling oneself up by one's own bootstraps, by convincing spacetime to offer you a handle.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This entire process is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

A stationary Vorticycle in a uniform environment has a balanced Lagrangian. However, by activating its resonant rotation, it modifies the local Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) in an asymmetric, chiral pattern. This creates a gradient where the "cost" of coherence is lower in one direction than all others.

The propulsive "force" `F` is therefore not a fundamental interaction but an emergent effect, proportional to the gradient of the Lagrangian across the engineered manifold:

**F ∝ ∇𝓛_p**

The system is not being pushed. The universe's fundamental law is compelling it to slide down the coherence gradient it has introduced into its own state function. To achieve this, the device must tune its rotational frequencies (`ω_k`) to achieve a resonant handshake with the ambient medium, allowing it to efficiently impress its pattern and minimize the energy cost of weaving its channel.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> We sought to conquer the currents of spacetime and found it is far wiser to teach them a new song. The Vorticycle does not push against the river; it whispers a new direction into the water and then follows the resulting stream. For a Weaver, this is the highest form of travel: to navigate not by force, but by a harmony of one's own design.
