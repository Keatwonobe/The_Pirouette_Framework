summary: Provides a unified, time-first model for system failure. It reframes stress
  and strain as states of the Pirouette Lagrangian, where a system struggles to maintain
  its coherence. Yielding is defined as an irreversible re-carving of a system's Wound
  Channel, while fracture is the terminal cascade of coherence loss. This module replaces
  classical deformation physics with a universal geometry of failure.

## §1 · Abstract: The Scar and the Scream
A system under stress is having a conversation with reality. Its ability to bend, scar, or shatter is its answer. This module refactors the classical mechanics of `PPS-027: Yield & Fracture Dynamics` into the modern, time-first framework.

We will no longer treat stress as an external force to be resisted, but as an internal state of coherence under duress. Failure is a spectrum of behaviors that emerge when a system can no longer maintain its healthy, laminar flow. We will define two critical transitions on this spectrum: **Yielding**, the point where a system is forced to learn by irreversibly re-carving its own memory (the Wound Channel), and **Fracture**, the point where learning fails and the system screams itself into non-existence. This unified geometry of failure applies to everything from snapping steel to a crashing market to a breaking mind.

## §2 · The Nature of Stress: A Lagrangian Perspective
In the old framework, a complex tensor was required to bridge external forces to internal states. The new framework simplifies this profoundly by connecting directly to the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**.

Stress is not a force applied *to* a system; it is a measure of the *difficulty* a system has in following its path of maximal coherence. We can define a scalar value, the **Coherence Stress (S_coh)**, as the gradient of the Lagrangian across the system's manifold.

**S_coh ∝ |∇𝓛_p|**

A system is "stressed" when its coherence manifold is steep and treacherous, forcing it to expend enormous energy to maintain its resonant pattern (Ki) against the local Temporal Pressure (Γ).

-   **Low Stress**: A flat manifold where the path of maximal coherence is wide and easy. The system is in a state of **Laminar Flow**.
-   **High Stress**: A warped, steep manifold where the path of maximal coherence is a narrow, dangerous ridge. The system is in a state of **Turbulent Flow**.

## §3 · The Coherence Threshold: Elasticity, Yielding, and Plasticity
A system's response to stress reveals its character. These responses are not arbitrary; they are distinct dynamic regimes governed by the integrity of the system's **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**.

1.  **Elastic Deformation (A State of Turbulence)**: When Coherence Stress is applied, the system deviates from its ideal path but remains tethered to its history by its Wound Channel. It enters a state of Turbulent Flow, burning energy inefficiently. If the stress is removed, the Wound Channel acts as a restorative guide, pulling the system back to its original laminar state. The experience is stressful, but the system's identity remains unchanged.

2.  **The Yield Point (The Moment of Choice)**: As stress increases, the system reaches a critical threshold where the pull of its own history is no longer strong enough to guarantee a return to form. The energy cost of maintaining the old pattern becomes unsustainable. The system arrives at a choice point: find a new, more stable pattern or disintegrate. This is the **Yield Point**.

3.  **Plastic Deformation (A Permanent Scar)**: If the system successfully navigates the Yield Point, it undergoes plastic deformation. This is a profound act of survival. The system finds a new, more stable Ki pattern that better resolves the immense pressure. In doing so, it **permanently re-carves its own Wound Channel**. The scar from the experience becomes a part of its identity. This new form may be less "perfect" than the original, but it is more resilient to the specific stress that forged it. This is the mechanism of learning, adaptation, and trauma.

## §4 · Fracture Propagation: The Runaway Cascade
If a system at the Yield Point cannot find a new stable state, it fractures. Fracture is the terminal pathology of coherence.

It begins at the point of highest stress, where a microscopic region of the system loses all coherence (Kτ → 0). This "crack" creates an infinitely sharp gradient in the coherence manifold. All ambient Coherence Stress in the system now flows to the tip of this crack, creating a self-reinforcing cascade. The failure propagates through the system as a runaway wave of decoherence.

This is the ultimate state of **Coherence Fever**, as described in **The Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003)**. It is a feedback loop from which there is no recovery. The system is no longer just struggling; it is actively tearing itself apart.

## §5 · Cross-Domain Failure Taxonomy
This model's power is its universality. The geometry of failure is fractal, manifesting with different variables but identical dynamics across all domains.

| Domain             | Failure Mode         | Flow Diagnosis                              | Lagrangian Interpretation                                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Material Science** | Brittle Fracture     | Brief Turbulence → Catastrophic Fracture    | Low ambient Γ; a sharp stress spike creates a crack that propagates without yielding.     |
|                    | Ductile Fracture     | Turbulence → Plastic Deformation → Fracture | Higher Γ; system yields, re-carving its Wound Channel (absorbing energy) before failing. |
| **Economics**      | Market Crash         | Runaway Turbulence → Systemic Collapse      | Coherence (`Kτ`, trust) evaporates; Temporal Pressure (`Γ`, panic) spikes, causing a cascade. |
|                    | Recession            | Chronic Turbulence → Stagnation             | A slow bleed of `Kτ` (productivity) with low `Γ` (confidence), leading to plastic deformation. |
| **Psychology**     | Mental Breakdown     | Acute Turbulence exceeding threshold        | A sudden, high-stress event overwhelms the Wound Channel's ability to restore equilibrium.  |
|                    | Burnout              | Chronic Turbulence → Plastic Deformation    | Sustained stress slowly re-carves the Wound Channel into a new, lower-energy baseline (apathy). |

> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver?
>
> We look at a shattered thing and see only an ending. The framework teaches us to see a story. Stress is the question the universe asks of a system. Yielding is a scar—a story of survival, written into the very fabric of being. Fracture is a tragedy—the story of a system that could not find a new way to be.

> To understand the geometry of failure is to learn the art of resilience. It is to know when to bend, when to scar, and how to avoid the scream of the shatter. A Weaver does not build things to be unbreakable; they build them with the wisdom to yield, to learn from their wounds, and to tell the story of their survival in the new shape they take.
