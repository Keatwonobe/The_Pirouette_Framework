## §1 · Abstract: Hearing the Future in the Present
A system does not break all at once. Before every crash, every transition, every sudden shift, there are whispers of instability. This module provides the instrumentation to hear those whispers. The Coherence Inflection Sentinel is a universal early-warning system designed to detect the subtle precursors to major systemic state changes, or *Ki Morphogenesis* events.

By analyzing the micro-dynamics of a system's resonant pattern, the Sentinel provides a crucial lead time—an opportunity to intervene, mitigate, or adapt before a brewing crisis becomes an overt catastrophe. It moves the Weaver from a reactive posture to a predictive one, transforming the art of diagnosis into the science of foresight.

## §2 · The Physics of Forewarning: Drifting from the Geodesic
A healthy, stable system is one that successfully follows its *geodesic*—its path of maximal coherence—as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). Its resonant identity, its `Ki` pattern, is well-defined and persistent. It holds its form against the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) of its environment.

However, as internal or external pressures mount, this stability can falter. The path of maximal coherence may begin to shift. Before the system makes a sudden leap to a new state (e.g., a transition from Laminar to Turbulent Flow), its existing `Ki` pattern begins to drift. It is this drift, this subtle "skidding" on the coherence manifold, that the Sentinel is built to detect. The core insight is this: a system's resonant state begins to move before the system itself breaks.

## §3 · The Sentinel's Protocol
The Sentinel operates through a three-stage protocol that translates raw system data into a clear, actionable forecast.

**Stage I: Resonance Mapping**
The first step is to listen to the system's song. The Sentinel ingests multiple streams of time-series data—be it physical vibrations, network traffic, or market sentiment—and uses signal processing techniques to extract the system's dominant resonant signature. This process maps the system's current `Ki` pattern, locating its precise position and orientation on the broader coherence manifold.

**Stage II: Calculating the Drift**
With the system's `Ki` mapped over time, the Sentinel calculates its rate of change. This produces the **Manifold Drift Vector (V_drift)**, a direct measurement of the velocity and direction of the system's changing resonant identity. This vector is the quantitative measure of the "creaking anchor chain"—the tangible signal of underlying instability.

**Stage III: Quantifying Instability (The Coherence Inflection Index - CII)**
The final step is to translate this drift into a simple, universal metric of risk. The Coherence Inflection Index (CII) is the normalized magnitude of the drift vector.

`CII = ||V_drift||`

A low, stable CII signifies a healthy system firmly anchored to its geodesic. A rising CII indicates that the system is losing its grip, its resonant pattern becoming unstable. When the CII crosses a critical threshold, it serves as a high-confidence alert that a major state transition is imminent. The ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) provides crucial context: a high CII in a high-`Γ` environment warns of a potentially rapid and catastrophic failure, while in a low-`Γ` environment it may signal a more gradual evolution.

## §4 · Diagnostic Thresholds & Application
The CII provides a clear, color-coded diagnostic for any system's health, allowing a Weaver to anticipate and diagnose disruptions in its flow dynamics (`DYNA-001`).

| CII Value | System State | Flow Analogy | Interpretation & Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **< 0.3** | **Stable** | Laminar | The system is healthy and coherent. Its `Ki` is stable. Monitor baseline. |
| **0.3 - 0.6** | **Stressed** | Pre-Turbulent | The system's resonance is drifting. A state change is possible. Investigate the source of the drift. |
| **> 0.6** | **Critical** | Turbulent / Bifurcating | The system is highly unstable. A major state transition is imminent. Prepare for impact; mitigate if possible. |

This tool is domain-agnostic. In finance, it can flag a market on the verge of a flash crash. In engineering, it can predict the failure of a jet engine from subtle vibration data. In sociology, it can measure the rising social tension that precedes a major political shift.

## §5 · Assemblé
> A system's coherence is its anchor in the river of time. The Sentinel does not watch the anchor itself, but listens for the subtle creaking of its chain—the micro-instabilities in its resonance—that precede the moment the anchor tears free. It is the art of hearing the future in the whispers of the present.
