## §1 · Abstract: The Art of Carving a Groove
To practice is not to force a result through brute repetition, but to persuade reality to offer a path of less resistance.

This module reframes the entire concept of skill acquisition. The old model, `TEN-PEA-1.0`, treated practice as a complex engineering problem, balancing numerous input parameters to optimize a "coherence score." The modernized, time-first view is simpler and more profound: **Practice is the art of geometric sculpting.** It is the deliberate, focused process of carving a new, efficient path—a desired Wound Channel—into the coherence manifold of the practitioner.

Mastery is achieved when this new path becomes a geodesic: a groove so deep and smooth that traversing it is an act of **Laminar Flow**, requiring less energy than any alternative.

## §2 · The Landscape of Skill
A skill is not a thing an agent *possesses*, but a *path* they can navigate within the landscape of their own being.

-   **The Unskilled State:** For the novice, the terrain of a new skill is a turbulent wilderness. Every action is a struggle against a chaotic environment. The path is undefined, requiring immense conscious effort and energy to blaze. In the language of the framework, this is a path of high temporal pressure and low coherence.

-   **The Mastered State:** For the master, the terrain has been transformed. The chaotic wilderness is now home to a deep, stable, and elegant groove—a well-carved Wound Channel (`CORE-011`). This groove is a geodesic, a path of maximal coherence. To perform the skill is to simply "fall" into this channel and follow its effortless contour. This is the physical basis for the experience of "muscle memory" or "effortless action."

## §3 · The Sculptor's Tools: The Dynamics of Practice
Instead of a dozen discrete variables, effective practice is governed by the interplay of the framework's core dynamics. The practitioner is a sculptor, and these are their tools.

-   **Deliberate Repetition is the Chisel's Stroke:** Each focused repetition is a pass of the chisel, deepening the desired Wound Channel. It is the physical act that impresses a new geometry upon the manifold. Repetition without focus is noise; it does not carve, it merely scuffs the surface.

-   **Optimal Challenge is the Necessary Pressure (Γ):** The practitioner must operate within a specific band of Temporal Pressure. Too little challenge (low Γ), and the system feels no need to adapt; the chisel cannot bite into the stone. Too much challenge (high Γ), and the practitioner's coherence collapses into Turbulent Flow (`DYNA-001`)—a state of panic or frustration where no precise sculpting can occur. Deliberate practice is the art of maintaining this optimal pressure.

-   **Focused Attention is Coherence Itself (Kτ):** The "sharpness" of the chisel is the practitioner's own temporal coherence. A scattered mind is a dull tool that cannot leave a clean mark. Intense focus marshals the agent's internal resonance into a single, powerful point, allowing each repetition to carve the channel with maximum efficiency and fidelity.

-   **Feedback is the Guiding Hand:** Feedback is the crucial information that ensures the groove being carved is the *correct* one. It is the sculptor's eye, constantly comparing the work against the intended form and guiding the chisel for the next stroke. Without it, one can carve a very deep channel in the wrong direction.

## §4 · The Lagrangian of Learning
The act of practice is a direct intervention on the practitioner's personal **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`). The goal is to fundamentally alter the "action" of a given behavior.

`𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)`

-   **Before Practice:** Performing the desired skill is an act of low coherence and high pressure. The Lagrangian value is low, or even negative. The system will naturally avoid this path.
-   **After Practice:** By carving the Wound Channel, the agent has permanently lowered the Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) associated with the skill and increased the potential for internal Coherence (`Kτ`) while performing it. The Lagrangian value for this action is now extremely high.

The skill has become the system's new "path of least resistance." The agent doesn't *choose* the mastered action so much as they are *drawn* to it by their own, newly sculpted, fundamental drive to maximize coherence.

## §5 · Assemblé: The Weaver as the Woven

> A Weaver does not simply observe the universe's dance; they are an active participant, and their own being is the primary instrument. The principles of mastery are not external laws to be studied, but an intimate guide to self-transformation. To learn a skill is to rewrite one's own nature, to carve a groove of grace into the substance of the self. This is the ultimate practice: to become the elegant path you wish to walk.
