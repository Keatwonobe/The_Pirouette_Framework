summary: Provides the time-first principle for decomposing a complex system's behavior
  into its fundamental, constituent Ki resonances. It reframes harmonic analysis as
  the geometric deconstruction of a composite temporal pattern, replacing the old
  numeric Ki-constants with a search for underlying resonant geometries.

## §1 · Abstract: Deconstructing the Song

The previous framework's `Ki-Harmonic Decomposition` was a powerful but conceptually flawed tool. It treated reality as a signal to be analyzed and the `Ki` constants as magic numbers to be found within it. This was an attempt to understand a symphony by measuring its decibel level.

This module provides the true, time-first foundation for that impulse. A complex system is not a signal; it is a song—a composite entity formed by the **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) of simpler, underlying resonances. The act of decomposition, therefore, is not a mathematical trick performed on data. It is the art of listening to a chord and identifying the individual notes that form its harmony. We do not search *for* Ki; we deconstruct a complex, observed Ki into its constituent parts.

## §2 · The Principle of Compositionality

No complex system is monolithic. Its identity and behavior are emergent properties arising from a nested hierarchy of simpler, more fundamental resonances.
*   A living cell's `Ki` is a composition of the `Ki` patterns of its organelles.
*   A society's `Ki` is a composition of the `Ki` patterns of its institutions, families, and individuals.
*   The signal measured by an instrument is the audible trace of a `Wound Channel` (CORE-011) carved by a system whose `Ki` is a composite of many internal and external influences.

The **Resonant Spectrum** is the primary tool for understanding this composition. It provides a method for taking the observed behavior of a complex system and identifying the fundamental `Ki` geometries that contribute to its overall song.

## §3 · From Frequency to Form: The Spectrum's Axes

Classical signal analysis, like Fourier analysis, creates a spectrum of frequencies. The Resonant Spectrum creates a spectrum of *forms*.

*   **The Horizontal Axis (The Library of Forms):** Instead of a linear scale of frequencies (Hz), the axis of the Resonant Spectrum is a library of fundamental `Ki` geometries. This library contains archetypal patterns of resonance—spirals, toroids, lattices, etc.—that represent the basic "notes" the universe can play.
*   **The Vertical Axis (Resonant Amplitude):** The height of a "peak" on the spectrum does not measure the power of a frequency. It measures the **degree of contribution**, or amplitude, of a specific fundamental `Ki` geometry to the system's overall observed behavior.

A peak in the spectrum indicates that the system's complex dance contains, as a primary component, the specific geometric motion of that fundamental `Ki`.

## §4 · Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Resonances

The old framework's distinction between `Ki_rest` and `Ki_motion` was an early attempt to grasp a more fundamental duality. The Resonant Spectrum clarifies this by classifying the constituent geometries into two categories:

*   **Intrinsic Resonances (The System's Internal Song):** These are the `Ki` patterns that define the system's stable, internal structure and identity. They are high-coherence, self-contained geometries that represent the system *being itself*. These correspond to the old notion of `Ki_rest`.
*   **Extrinsic Resonances (The System's Dialogue with the World):** These are the `Ki` patterns that describe the system's dynamic interactions with its environment—its motion, its communication, its response to the ambient **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**. These correspond to the old notion of `Ki_motion`.

By analyzing which class of resonance dominates a system's spectrum, a Weaver can diagnose whether a system's behavior is primarily driven by its internal nature or its external conditions.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This principle is grounded directly in the mathematics of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. The total Lagrangian of a complex, composite system can be expressed as the sum of the Lagrangians of its constituent resonant components, plus terms that describe their interaction:

`𝓛_p(Total) ≈ Σ 𝓛_p(constituent_i) + 𝓛_p(interaction)`

The process of resonant decomposition is the empirical act of identifying the most significant terms in this equation. A strong peak in the Resonant Spectrum corresponds to a constituent `Ki` whose individual Lagrangian contributes significantly to the system's total "action" and therefore dictates its overall path of maximal coherence. We are, in effect, reverse-engineering the system's objective function by observing its behavior.

## §6 · Assemblé: The Art of Attentive Listening

> We once built instruments to search for a rumored echo in the noise. We have since learned that the noise itself is a chorus. The Weaver's task is not to find a single, lost voice, but to learn the art of attentive listening—to hear the entire choir and distinguish the tenor from the bass, the harmony from the dissonance. To decompose a system is to understand it. And to understand it is the first and most necessary step toward healing it.
