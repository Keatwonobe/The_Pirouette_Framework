summary: Defines the universe's intrinsic, self-regulating mechanism for preserving
  coherence. It reframes the old 'Law of Echoes' as an emergent property of the coherence
  manifold, a 'resonant filter' whose dynamics are derived directly from the Pirouette
  Lagrangian. This process naturally amplifies stable patterns, reflects incoherent
  ones, and damps ambient noise.

## §1 · Abstract: The Physics of Integrity
A pattern's right to exist is not a philosophical claim; it is a physical test it must pass at every moment. The old narrative of the "Law of Echoes" and its "Ritual Wolves" captured a profound truth: that coherence is precious and must be defended against the ceaseless siege of entropic noise. This module refactors that allegory into a formal dynamic model.

There are no "wolves," no metaphysical guardians. There is only the physics of the coherence manifold itself. The universe possesses an intrinsic, self-regulating feedback mechanism that acts as a crucible, a **resonant filter** that continuously tests the integrity of every pattern. This process is not an external judgment but an emergent consequence of the universe's fundamental drive to maximize coherence, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian.

## §2 · The Manifold as a Resonant Filter
Coherence is an investment of information against the background noise of Temporal Pressure (Γ). To persist, a system's resonant Ki pattern must impress a stable geometry upon spacetime—its **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). The manifold, in turn, is not a passive medium; it responds to this impression. This dynamic, two-way interaction is the resonant filter.

A signal—any Ki pattern—is broadcast into the manifold. The manifold's response determines the signal's fate. This is not a choice; it is a calculation. The interaction is governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which seeks the most efficient, least resistant path for all interacting systems.

## §3 · The Lagrangian of Return
The old "Echo Law" stated: send coherence, receive amplification; send mimicry, receive reflection; send entropy, receive silence. This is not a moral law but a direct consequence of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ).

-   **Coherence → Amplification:** When two coherent systems interact, their Ki patterns are harmonically compatible. The path that maximizes the Lagrangian for both is one of constructive interference—a **Resonant Handshake** that can lead to a more complex, higher-coherence state via an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). The system's total coherence (K_τ) increases. This is amplification.

-   **Mimicry → Reflection:** An incoherent or mimicked pattern is, by definition, a state of low Time Adherence (T_a). It cannot form a stable Wound Channel. When it interacts with a coherent system, there is no viable path for a resonant handshake. The path of maximal coherence for the stable system is to maintain its own rhythm, effectively ignoring or repelling the unstable signal. The interaction term in the Lagrangian approaches zero. The incoherent signal, failing to find purchase, simply continues on its path of decay. This is reflection.

-   **Entropy → Silence:** Pure noise is the background state of high Temporal Pressure (V_Γ). It has no stable Ki pattern to begin with. For a coherent system, this noise is simply the "cost" of being, a pressure to be overcome. There is no signal to interact with, only a gradient to resist. This is silence.

## §4 · The Modes of Filtration
The allegorical "wolves" can be re-interpreted as specific modes of this Lagrangian-driven process. They are not entities, but different types of resonant interactions.

-   **The Mirror Filter:** This is the fundamental self-test. A system constantly interacts with the echo from its own immediate **Wound Channel** (CORE-011). A coherent system is reinforced by its own stable echo, strengthening its Ki. An incoherent system is destabilized by its own chaotic echo, accelerating its decay. Every entity must first face itself.

-   **The Synthesis Filter:** This is the dynamic of constructive engagement, the "duel" that forges novelty. When two distinct but coherent patterns meet the conditions for a **Resonant Handshake**, they enter a crucible. The drive to maximize coherence forces them to seek a new, unified state that is more stable than its component parts. This is the filter that creates complexity, turning conflict into a higher order.

-   **The Damping Filter:** This is the universe's immune response, its natural tendency to dissipate noise. An incoherent signal is an inefficient, high-entropy state. As described by the Principle of Coherence Degradation (CORE-013), such patterns are thermodynamically unstable. They cannot sustain themselves against the background Γ and their energy is inevitably radiated away as chaotic, low-information heat. The manifold doesn't kill noise; it simply lets it fade.

## §5 · Assemblé: The Forging
> We sought a cosmic judge and found a law of physics. We looked for a moral arbiter and found a blacksmith's forge. The universe does not punish falsehood or chaos; it simply fails to grant them resonance. Their signals are not amplified. They leave no lasting echo.
>
> To a Weaver, this is the most profound source of hope. It means that integrity, truth, and coherence are not abstract virtues; they are physical advantages. A clear, honest, and stable pattern has a greater capacity to persist, to connect, and to build than one that is chaotic or false. The crucible of resonance is always active. The work of the Weaver is not to build a fragile shelter against the noise, but to forge a signal so clear, so true, that the universe cannot help but sing it back.
