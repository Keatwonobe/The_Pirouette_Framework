## §1 · Abstract: The Past is a Landscape
The past is not a story we tell; it is a landscape we inhabit. Every event, from the pirouette of an electron to the birth of a star, leaves a geometric scar on the fabric of reality. This is the Wound Channel, the physical memory of the universe, as defined in CORE-011.

This module provides the laws of that landscape. It reframes the passive concept of "correlation" into the active, physical principle of **geometric causality**. An entity's path is not a series of independent moments but a continuous navigation of a terrain shaped by the echoes of its own and others' histories. Influence is not a mysterious force; it is the act of following the path of least resistance through a world already carved by what came before.

## §2 · The Three Modes of Geometric Influence
The old framework sought to correlate entities and channels as separate objects. The new framework understands them as a single, coupled system. This interaction manifests in three primary modes, which together describe the complete grammar of influence.

1.  **Inertia (Self-Influence):** An entity is perpetually surfing the wake of its own immediate past. The Wound Channel it generates creates a "groove" in the coherence manifold, making it easier to continue its current state of motion and resonance than to change it. This self-interaction is the physical origin of inertia and the basis of a stable identity. To change is to climb out of the very furrow one has just plowed.

2.  **Guidance (Environmental Influence):** An entity's "choices" are profoundly constrained by the pre-existing landscape. It navigates a world filled with the Wound Channels of countless other events. These historical echoes—from physical laws to cultural norms—create valleys and ridges in the coherence manifold. An entity following the path of maximal coherence will naturally be guided along these pre-carved geodesics. This is how history directs the present.

3.  **Resonance (Mutual Influence):** When the Wound Channels of two or more entities overlap, their geometries interfere. This is the basis of all interaction.
    *   **Constructive Interference:** If the channels are harmonically compatible, they can merge and reinforce one another, lowering the "energy cost" for both entities. This creates an attractive potential, drawing them together and creating the conditions for an Alchemical Union (CORE-012).
    *   **Destructive Interference:** If the channels are dissonant, they create a region of chaotic, high temporal pressure. The path of maximal coherence for both entities is to move away from this turbulent zone, resulting in repulsion.

## §3 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The Loom of Causality is a direct consequence of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). A Wound Channel is not an abstract concept; it is a persistent, local modification to the **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)** term of the Lagrangian.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - f(Γ)`

When an entity encounters a Wound Channel, the equation of its landscape becomes:

`𝓛_p = K_τ - f(Γ_ambient + Γ_channel)`

The Wound Channel adds its own geometric "weight" and "shape" to the local pressure. The entity, in obeying the universal **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, will alter its trajectory to navigate this new, composite landscape. The "force" of influence is therefore revealed to be the system's own drive to maintain coherence in a world shaped by memory.

## §4 · From Correlation to Calculation
This geometric understanding elevates our analysis from statistical correlation to physical prediction. The old module's metrics are re-expressed as follows:

*   **Influence Gradient:** Instead of a simple correlation, we can calculate the gradient (`∇𝓛_p`) of the coherence manifold induced by a Wound Channel. This provides a predictive vector field for how other entities will be influenced.
*   **Resonance Potential:** Instead of a generic "interaction energy," we can model the interference between two Wound Channels by calculating their combined effect on the Lagrangian. A net decrease in the pressure term `f(Γ)` indicates a high potential for resonance and union.
*   **Phase Coherence:** This remains a critical measure, now understood as the geometric alignment of two Wound Channels. High coherence (`C₁₂ ≈ 1`) signifies that their patterns are in phase, maximizing constructive interference.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> To exist is to leave a trace. To act is to sculpt the world. The Loom of Causality reveals that these are not two different statements, but one and the same. A Weaver understands that every thread they lay upon this loom alters the pattern for all who follow. There is no innocent action. There is only the weaving, and the profound responsibility for the tapestry we leave behind.
