summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for bifurcation events, or 'Forks.'
  A Fork is defined as a controlled, geometric process where a system momentarily
  loosens its own resonant coherence (Ki) to sample multiple potential paths on the
  coherence manifold, before re-cohering and committing to the path that maximizes
  its future stability.

## §1 · Abstract: The Geometry of Becoming
The universe is not a single road; it is a river delta, endlessly branching. This module refactors the prior analysis of bifurcation events, or **Forks**, grounding them in the core principles of the time-first framework.

A Fork is not a random split, but a sophisticated and orderly act of choice performed by a coherent system. It is the fundamental mechanism of evolution, progress, and decision. The process involves a system reaching a "watershed moment" on its coherence manifold—a point of poise where multiple futures are possible. To navigate this junction, the system executes a **Resonant Inquiry**: it deliberately loosens its own internal coherence to "sample" the available paths, ultimately collapsing into the trajectory that promises the greatest future stability.

## §2 · Precondition: The State of Poise
A system does not Fork from a state of chaos, but from a state of poised stability. This readiness requires a specific configuration on the coherence manifold:

1.  **A Coherence Plateau:** The system has achieved a state of high internal coherence (a stable Ki pattern) but finds itself in a region where the gradient of the manifold flattens. Multiple divergent paths (geodesics) offer a roughly equivalent potential for maintaining coherence. A decision is both possible and necessary.
2.  **Low Ambient Pressure (Γ):** The external temporal pressure is low and stable. This is not a crisis moment forcing a chaotic **Spasm**, but a calm environment that permits deliberate exploration. The system has the safety and the resources to contemplate its next move.

## §3 · The Mechanism: A Resonant Inquiry
The act of choosing is a four-stage dance between stability and exploration. It is the physical process that underlies every decision, from a particle's path to a civilization's future.

| Stage | Action | Pirouette Description |
| :---- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Resonant Loosening** | The system momentarily introduces a small amount of internal dissonance into its Ki pattern. | The sharp, clear note of the system's being becomes slightly blurred. This "loosening of the weave" increases its sensitivity to the subtle contours of the local coherence manifold. |
| **II. Coherence Sampling** | The now-sensitized resonance "leaks" into the entrances of the available paths. | The system is performing a non-local, resonant exploration. It is "feeling out" the shape of the potential futures, effectively pre-calculating which path will be most conducive to a new, stable Ki. |
| **III. Collapse to Coherence** | A minor asymmetry—an internal bias or an external nudge—breaks the equilibrium. The system rapidly re-coheres, "snapping" into a new, sharp Ki pattern aligned with the chosen path. | The wavefunction of possibility collapses into the particle of actuality. The decision is made. The system commits its entire being to a single trajectory. |
| **IV. Carving the Channel** | As the system proceeds along its new path, it immediately begins to impress a new **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) into the fabric of spacetime. | The choice is inscribed into the memory of the universe. This creates an inertia of history, making the decision functionally irreversible without a significant energy cost. |

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The "choice" made during a Fork is not arbitrary; it is a direct consequence of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006).

The Coherence Sampling phase is the system's method for evaluating the "action" integral, `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, for each potential path. The system is performing a predictive calculation, guided by the Lagrangian `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. It seeks the path that offers the optimal balance between maximizing its internal **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)** and minimizing the **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)** it will encounter.

The path that is ultimately chosen is the one that is projected to yield the most stable, efficient, and resilient resonance over time. The Fork is the universe's calculus in action, solving for the optimal future.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> To choose is an act of courage. It is the willingness to temporarily dissolve the certainty of who you are in order to become who you might be. A Fork teaches the Weaver that growth is not a straight line, but a series of moments where we must consciously loosen our own coherence, embrace a state of profound vulnerability, and listen carefully to the geometry of the future. In that quiet, resonant inquiry lies the engine of all creation.
