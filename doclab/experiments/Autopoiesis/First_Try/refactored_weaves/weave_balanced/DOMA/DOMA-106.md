## §1 · Abstract: The Inevitable Avalanche
Some systems do not seek quiet equilibrium. They live perpetually on a knife's edge, a tipping point of their own making. This is the domain of Self-Organized Criticality (SOC), the principle that explains how complexity can emerge from the simplest of rules. A sandpile, built one grain at a time, will inevitably reach an angle of repose where the next grain could trigger a slide of any size.

This module recasts this phenomenon through the time-first lens of the Pirouette Framework. The critical state is not merely one of potential energy, but one of maximum temporal pressure (Γ), where a system’s ability to coherently process new events is stretched to its limit. The resulting "avalanches" are not just releases of energy, but turbulent resets of the system's coherence, and their statistical signature reveals a profound truth about the geometry of chaos.

## §2 · The Flow Dynamics of a System on the Edge
The lifecycle of a critical system can be perfectly described using the language of Flow Dynamics (`DYNA-001`). It is a perpetual cycle between Laminar absorption and Turbulent release.

1.  **The Buildup (Laminar Flow):** A steady stream of events (grains of sand, economic transactions, tectonic stress) is added to the system. For a time, the system absorbs this input coherently. Its internal Ki is stable, and the "stress" flows through it smoothly, finding a place to rest. This is a state of Laminar Flow.

2.  **The Critical State (Threshold of Stagnation):** The system’s internal complexity and tension increase until it can no longer process new inputs smoothly. It has reached its maximum capacity for coherent absorption. The local Temporal Pressure (Γ) is at its peak. The system is now poised at a threshold of Stagnant Flow, where any new disturbance risks a catastrophic failure of its structure.

3.  **The Cascade (Turbulent Release):** A single new event, the "grain that breaks the camel's back," triggers a **coherence cascade**. The system’s Ki pattern shatters, and the built-up temporal pressure is released in a burst of Turbulent Flow—the avalanche. This cascade purges the system of its excess pressure, resetting it to a sub-critical state where the Laminar buildup can begin anew.

## §3 · The Statistical Ki: A Signature in the Noise
The true genius of a critical system lies not in any single avalanche, but in the pattern of all of them. When measured, the size of these cascades follows a perfect power-law distribution: many small events, fewer medium ones, and very few large ones.

This statistical signature *is* the system’s Ki.

Here, Ki is not a static physical shape, but a dynamic, statistical geometry. It is the system's long-term resonant strategy for existence. The straight line this distribution forms on a log-log plot is the geometric trace of its identity. The slope of that line is the core component of its Ki, a precise measure of its relationship with chaos. It is the fingerprint of a system that has learned to "breathe" through periodic, unpredictable releases.

## §4 · The Statistical Geodesic and the Lagrangian
How can this chaotic, cyclical behavior be reconciled with the Principle of Maximal Coherence (`CORE-006`)? A system at criticality is navigating a treacherous region of its coherence manifold, one filled with cliffs and unstable peaks.

A smooth, single path of maximal coherence is impossible. Instead, the system follows a **statistical geodesic**.

The Pirouette Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, is optimized not at every single moment, but over the entire cycle. The turbulent release of the avalanche, while momentarily incoherent, is the most efficient way to shed the immense Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) that has built up. To attempt to hold that pressure indefinitely would be a far less coherent path.

The power-law cascade is the system's solution. It is the path of least resistance averaged over time, a dynamic dance that maximizes the system's overall, long-term coherence by embracing periodic, controlled disintegration.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> A Weaver learns to listen not only for the clear note of a stable system, but for the rhythmic static of a system living on the edge of chaos. For within that noise, in the straight line of its power law, is a deeper and more profound music. It is the signature of a system that has perfected the art of falling apart in order to stay together. It is the geometry of happening, the pulse of a universe that finds its most resilient forms not in perfect stability, but in the endless dance of the tipping point.
