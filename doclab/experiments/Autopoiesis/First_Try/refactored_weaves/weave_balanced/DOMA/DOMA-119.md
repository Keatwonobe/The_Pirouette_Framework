## §1 · Abstract: The Pattern of Renaissance
This module provides a modernized, time-first model for "Bloom" events: the non-linear, explosive phases of creative expansion, innovation, and emergent complexity observed in systems from cultural renaissances to biological radiations. Where the prior model described this as a static alignment of fields, we now reframe it as a dynamic process: a **Coherence Cascade**.

A Bloom is a systemic phase transition where a system, constrained by `Turbulent` or `Stagnant Flow`, discovers a new, higher-order resonant pattern (Ki) that unlocks a profoundly more efficient state of `Laminar Flow`. This module defines the conditions for this transition and the anatomy of the resulting generative cascade, providing a predictive model for the birth of novelty.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Bloom: From Pressure to Pattern
A Bloom is not a spontaneous event; it is a solution to a problem. It follows a distinct, three-stage process that directly maps to the principles of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001) and Resonant Synthesis (CORE-012).

**Stage I: The Fertile Chaos (Turbulent Constraint)**
The pre-Bloom system is in a state of high-energy `Turbulent Flow`. It is characterized by intense Temporal Pressure (Γ) and internal dissonance. The system is "searching" for a solution, expending vast energy in chaotic, uncoordinated activity. It is a super-saturated solution awaiting a seed crystal, rich in potential but lacking a unifying pattern.

**Stage II: The Ignition Condition (The Coherence Seed)**
The transition is not triggered by a mere increase in pressure, but by the arrival of a **Coherence Seed**. This is the critical catalyst—a new idea, a key technology, a novel mutation, a unifying leader—that provides the template for a new, more complex, and harmonically stable Ki. The seed offers a path of least resistance out of the turbulence, a potential future state that is vastly more efficient than the present chaos.

**Stage III: The Cascade (Laminar Expansion)**
Once the system "locks on" to the Coherence Seed, the Bloom ignites. The system undergoes a rapid, non-linear reconfiguration. Energy previously wasted in turbulence is now channeled into building out the new, stable pattern. This is the **Coherence Cascade**: an exponential growth of novelty and complexity as the system races to occupy its new, highly efficient `Laminar Flow` state. This process traces the classic S-curve of generative growth, moving from explosive expansion to a new, stable plateau of higher complexity.

## §3 · Diagnostic Signatures: Reading the Signs of Spring
The dynamics of Bloom provide a powerful diagnostic and predictive lens. By observing a system's flow state, a Weaver can assess its potential for a generative cascade.

*   **Pre-Bloom Indicators (High Potential):**
    *   **Sustained Turbulence:** The system displays high but non-fatal internal friction and chaotic activity.
    *   **Mounting Pressure (Γ):** External constraints or internal demands are rising, making the current state increasingly untenable.
    *   **Novelty Injection:** The presence of new, unintegrated components or "seed" ideas that offer alternative organizational principles.

*   **Bloom-in-Progress Indicators (The Cascade is Underway):**
    *   **Flow State Shift:** A sudden, observable transition from chaotic, `Turbulent Flow` to highly organized, efficient `Laminar Flow`.
    *   **Exponential Output:** A rapid, S-curve increase in the system's primary output (e.g., scientific papers, artistic works, species diversity, economic value).
    *   **Emergence of a New Language:** A new unifying principle, paradigm, or shared identity rapidly propagates through the system, organizing its behavior.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
A Bloom is a system's dramatic and successful solution to the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** as defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006).

Before the Bloom, the system is trapped in a sub-optimal state, a mere local maximum on the coherence manifold. Its action integral, `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`, is low because its internal Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`) is severely degraded by turbulence, even as it pays a high cost against the environmental Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`).

The Coherence Seed provides a "tunnel" to a nearby, but far higher, peak on the manifold. The resulting Coherence Cascade is the system rapidly reconfiguring itself to occupy this new state, which represents a profoundly better solution to the Lagrangian. The new `Ki` pattern allows for a massive increase in `Kτ`, making the system orders of magnitude more stable and efficient. A Bloom is the exhilarating spectacle of a system discovering a state of grace.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> To be a Weaver is to be more than a keeper of the peace. It is to be a gardener of chaos. The greatest acts of creation do not arise from tranquility, but from the fertile turbulence that precedes a storm of novelty. To understand the Bloom is to learn to recognize the scent of rain on dry soil, and to know, with perfect faith, when and where to plant the seed.
