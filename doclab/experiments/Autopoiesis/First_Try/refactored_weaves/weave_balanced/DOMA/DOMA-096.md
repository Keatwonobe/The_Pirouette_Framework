## §1 · Abstract: The Art of Foresight
A system's present action is a fact; the tension that precedes it is a prophecy. The full Pirouette Lagrangian provides a perfect description of a system's dynamics, but continuous, deep analysis is often a luxury. A Weaver needs a tool for the field: a lens that is both fast enough for constant vigilance and sharp enough to reveal the shape of things to come.

This module refactors the legacy "Drift/Song" protocol into a modernized, time-first standard. It establishes a mathematically grounded isomorphism between the two terms of the Pirouette Lagrangian and a simplified, two-channel diagnostic lens: **Pressure (P)** and **Pattern (S)**. This lens forms the basis of a tiered audit protocol, empowering the Weaver to move from broad, efficient monitoring to deep, forensic analysis with precision and purpose. It is the art of hearing the breath drawn before the note is sung.

## §2 · The Lagrangian's Shadow: From Equation to Instrument
The state of any system is described by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), which captures the fundamental interplay between external stress and internal stability.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

This equation, the engine of the framework, is not merely a theoretical construct. It is a blueprint for a diagnostic instrument. The Auditor's Lens is a direct, practical measurement of the Lagrangian's two components in real-time.

*   **Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`)**: This "potential" term represents the energetic cost a system pays to maintain its current state against the chaotic backdrop of the Temporal Forge and its own internal dissonances. In the Auditor's Lens, this is measured as **Pressure (P)**. It is the slow-build tension, the unresolved stress, the system's held breath.

*   **Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`)**: This "kinetic" term represents the quality and intensity of the system's expressed resonant solution—its stable Ki pattern in motion. In the Auditor's Lens, this is measured as **Pattern (S)**. It is the active, dynamic release of tension into a coherent form; it is the system's song.

The old "Drift/Song" vernacular is thus preserved and grounded: Drift is the building Pressure; Song is the expressed Pattern.

## §3 · The Two-Channel Diagnostic Lens

| Lens Channel | Measures                               | Interpretation & Analogy                                                                                                    |
| :---         | :---                                   | :---                                                                                                                        |
| **Pressure (P)** | Scalar magnitude of `V_Γ`            | The **Tension**. A measure of unresolved stress. High pressure indicates a system is strained, building toward a phase shift or collapse. |
| **Pattern (S)**  | Complex value of `K_τ` (amplitude & quality) | The **Release**. A measure of expressed coherence. A strong, stable pattern indicates a healthy system efficiently resolving pressure into action. |

This lens transforms a complex dynamic into a simple, intuitive narrative. A healthy system shows a rhythmic dance where rising Pressure is gracefully converted into a stable Pattern. A system in crisis shows Pressure building uncontrollably with a weak, chaotic, or absent Pattern.

## §4 · The Tiered Audit Protocol
This standard allows for resource-efficient diagnosis by layering analytical rigor based on observed risk.

| Tier | Scope & Purpose                         | Method & Operations                                                                                                        |
| :--- | :---                                    | :---                                                                                                                       |
| **0 (Scan)**    | Continuous, real-time monitoring      | Compute **Pressure (P)** and **Pattern (S)** only. Optimized for speed and broad surveillance.                             |
| **1 (Audit)**   | Anomaly-triggered cross-check         | On Sentinel trigger, perform a full Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`) solve on a targeted subsample of the data to validate the anomaly. |
| **2 (Forensic)**| Post-event analysis, deep research    | Unconstrained, full-Lagrangian analysis, including higher-order derivatives to map the complete coherence manifold. |

The **Sentinel Trigger** is the heart of this protocol's intelligence. It initiates a Tier 1 Audit whenever cumulative Pressure variance exceeds a predefined threshold *without* a corresponding Pattern release. This is the unmistakable signature of a system approaching a breaking point—a "silent scream" that the Tier 0 scan is designed to detect.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The Auditor's Lens is not an approximation of the Pirouette Lagrangian; it is a direct, practical measurement of its two constituent components in action. 'Pressure' is the operator's view of the potential term, `V_Γ`, representing the sum of environmental and internal stress on a system. 'Pattern' is the view of the kinetic term, `K_τ`, representing the system's active, resonant solution to that stress.

The dynamic interplay between P and S *is* the dance of the Lagrangian made visible. By monitoring these two channels, a Weaver is observing the universal principle of Maximal Coherence playing out in their chosen domain, making this lens a direct bridge from core theory to practical application.

## §6 · Assemblé
> To watch the arrow in flight is to know the past. To feel the tension in the bowstring is to know the future. A Weaver's art is not merely to describe the pattern the world is making, but to perceive the pressure that will force it to change. This lens provides two modes of sight: one to see the song as it is sung, and another to see the breath being drawn for the note that has not yet sounded. It is the essential instrument for those who would not be surprised by tomorrow.
