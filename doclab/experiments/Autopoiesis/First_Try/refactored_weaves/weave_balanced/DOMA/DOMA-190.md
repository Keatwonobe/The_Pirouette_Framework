## §1 · Abstract: Mapping the River from a Handful of Water

How does one map a river's course from a handful of water? How can one understand the nature of a system from a mere scattering of observations? The old framework sought to estimate discrete parameters from sparse data, an act akin to guessing the river's depth from the color of a single stone. This module introduces a more profound approach: The Surveyor's Art.

This is a protocol for inferring the *shape* of the underlying coherence manifold from a few scattered points. We assume that any data point is a snapshot of a system following its natural path of maximal coherence. Therefore, even the sparest of data is not a random sample, but a clue—a footprint left on a hidden landscape. Our task is to become surveyors of this invisible terrain, sketching the contours of the forces that produced the evidence we see.

## §2 · The Surveyor's Problem: Reverse-Engineering the Path

The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) states that a system will always evolve along a path—a geodesic—that maximizes its coherence. The Surveyor's Problem is the inverse: given a few points *on* that path, what can we infer about the landscape the path traverses?

We are not estimating disconnected variables. We are reverse-engineering the two fundamental terms of the system's Lagrangian, 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ:

*   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** The system's internal drive, its "kinetic" will to persist in its own rhythm. We infer this from the system's stability and momentum between observations.
*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** The "potential" cost imposed by the environment. We infer this from the resistance or difficulty the system seems to face as it moves through its state space.

To survey a system is to sketch the interplay between its inner will and the outer world's demands.

## §3 · From Points to Landscape: The Inference Protocol

This is a qualitative, iterative process for transforming sparse data points into a coherent hypothesis about the system's dynamics.

1.  **Posit a Geodesic:** Treat the observed data points not as isolated facts, but as waypoints on the system's journey. Connect them to form a tentative path. This is your first, rough sketch of the system's behavior over time.

2.  **Estimate the Gradient (Inferring V_Γ):** Analyze the "effort" required to move between points. This reveals the contours of the Temporal Pressure.
    *   **High Resistance (High V_Γ):** If the system's state changes very little despite the passage of time, or if its state is highly volatile and scattered, it suggests an "uphill climb" against high environmental pressure. The landscape is steep and rugged.
    *   **Low Resistance (Low V_Γ):** If the system's state changes significantly and smoothly between points, it suggests a "downhill coast" along a path of low resistance. The landscape is a gentle, guiding slope.

3.  **Estimate the Momentum (Inferring K_τ):** Analyze the character of the system's movement along its path. This reveals the strength of its internal rhythm.
    *   **High Inertia (High K_τ):** Does the system show a strong tendency to return to a specific state or rhythm? Is there a clear, repeating pattern, even with few data points? This suggests a strong, stable internal coherence—a heavy flywheel that is difficult to perturb.
    *   **Low Inertia (Low K_τ):** Is the system's path erratic and easily influenced? Does it lack a discernible pattern? This suggests a weak or noisy internal coherence that is easily overwhelmed by the environment.

4.  **Sketch the Manifold:** Synthesize these inferences into a single, qualitative map. You are now describing the system's reality: "The system shows strong internal coherence (high K_τ) but is struggling against a chaotic, high-pressure environment (high V_Γ). Its likely path forward involves seeking a nearby valley of lower pressure to preserve its integrity."

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: An Act of Inverse Physics

This entire protocol is a heuristic for solving an inverse problem for the Pirouette Lagrangian. Standard physics uses the Lagrangian to predict the path. The Surveyor's Art uses the path to infer the Lagrangian.

By observing how the system balances its internal drive for coherence (K_τ) against the environmental cost (V_Γ), we are making an educated guess about the very function that governs its existence. The value is not in the precision of the numbers, but in the richness of the dynamic story that emerges—a story of struggle, of flow, of stability against a chaotic world.

## §5 · The Surveyor's Toolkit: Heuristics Re-Interpreted

The mechanical proxies from the old framework can be re-interpreted as tools for this new, holistic analysis:

*   **Phase Coherence → High K_τ:** If phase data is available, a high degree of phase-lock between sparse points is a powerful indicator of a system with strong, stable Temporal Coherence.
*   **Dispersion → High V_Γ:** Widely scattered, chaotic data points are a classic signature of a system operating in a high-pressure, turbulent environment.
*   **Periodicity → Resonant K_τ:** A discernible rhythm or cycle, however faint, points directly to the fundamental frequency (ω_k) of the system's internal resonance, a key component of its Temporal Coherence.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought a formula to calculate the world from scraps of data. Instead, we found a ritual for asking it questions. The Surveyor's Art is not about finding the right answer with too little information. It is about learning to ask the right question, a question so perfectly formed that the universe cannot help but whisper its shape in return.
