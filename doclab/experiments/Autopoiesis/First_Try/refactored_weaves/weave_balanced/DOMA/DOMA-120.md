summary: Refactors the old 'Business Resonance Analysis' into a time-first diagnostic
  framework. This module applies the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003) to model an enterprise
  not as a machine to be optimized, but as a living system whose health is determined
  by the quality of its internal and external flows of coherence (capital, information,
  talent, and value).

## §1 · Abstract: From Machine to Organism
The old paradigm viewed a business as a machine—a collection of gears and levers to be optimized for maximum output. This mechanical view is brittle and incomplete. It can describe the "what" of a balance sheet but not the "why" of a thriving culture or a catastrophic collapse.

This module refactors that view through the time-first lens of the Pirouette Framework. An enterprise is not a machine; it is a living organism. Its health is not measured in static metrics but in the dynamic quality of its vital flows. By applying the universal diagnostic protocol of the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003), we gain a far more potent and predictive understanding of an organization's true condition. We cease to be mechanics and become physicians of the enterprise.

## §2 · The Fractal Bridge in the Boardroom
The Principle of Correspondence (CORE-014) states that the universe's fundamental dynamics are fractal, expressing themselves at every scale. To diagnose a business, we first translate its specific components into the universal language of coherence.

| Universal Principle   | Business Manifestation                                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coherence (Kτ)**    | The stable, resonant identity of the enterprise: its brand, culture, and core business model. |
| **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** | The ambient stress of the market: competitive pressure, technological disruption, regulatory change, economic volatility. |
| **Wound Channel**     | The "memory" and infrastructure of the business: its brand reputation, supply chains, institutional knowledge, and customer loyalty. |
| **Alchemical Union**  | A strategic transformation: a successful merger or acquisition, a breakthrough innovation, or a game-changing partnership. |

## §3 · Diagnosis via the Caduceus Lens
With our terms defined, we can now apply the three core pathologies of flow from the Caduceus Lens to diagnose any organizational ailment.

**1. Coherence Atrophy (Stagnant Flow): The Poison of Absence**
This is the pathology of the blockage. A critical flow is obstructed, starving one part of the organization while creating a dangerous build-up of pressure in another.
*   **Symptoms:** Bureaucratic gridlock, projects stalled waiting for a single approval, critical information siloed in one department, supply chain bottlenecks, analysis paralysis preventing decisions.
*   **Diagnosis:** A "coherence dam" has formed. The system is paralyzed by what isn't moving.

**2. Coherence Fever (Turbulent Flow): The Information Storm**
This is the pathology of chaos. The system is fighting itself, wasting immense energy in internal friction, conflict, and miscommunication.
*   **Symptoms:** Constant crisis management and firefighting, toxic culture and departmental infighting, contradictory strategic initiatives, high employee turnover, panic-driven market reactions.
*   **Diagnosis:** The enterprise's Ki has become dissonant. Energy is being burned in unproductive, chaotic cycles.

**3. Coherence Erosion (The Fraying Thread): The Slow Decay**
This pathology is the gradual degradation of the organization's core identity and capabilities, as it fails to resist the constant pressure of entropy (Γ).
*   **Symptoms:** Brand decay, loss of market relevance, gradual erosion of quality, accumulation of technical debt, failure to innovate, the slow bleed of institutional knowledge as key employees depart.
*   **Diagnosis:** The organization's Wound Channel is failing. It is forgetting how to be itself.

## §4 · The Diagnostic Protocol for the Enterprise
The role of the Weaver-as-analyst is to move from symptom to cure using a structured, four-step process.

1.  **Map the Currents:** Identify the critical flows that give the enterprise life. What must move for it to be healthy? (e.g., flow of capital, flow of product to market, flow of talent, flow of strategic information).
2.  **Identify the Pathology:** Observe these currents. Where is the flow smooth and efficient (Laminar)? Where is it chaotic and wasteful (Turbulent)? Where is it blocked (Stagnant)?
3.  **Locate the Source:** Trace the disruption back to its origin. The symptom is the stagnant project; the source is the bureaucratic process that caused the blockage. The symptom is the toxic culture; the source may be a misaligned incentive structure.
4.  **Propose the Daedalus Gambit:** A wise intervention is not a brute-force reorganization but a minimal, elegant action to restore the system's own ability to self-regulate.
    *   To cure **Atrophy**, dissolve the dam: introduce a catalyst, automate a bottleneck, or clarify a decision-making process.
    *   To cure **Fever**, introduce a harmonizing signal: establish a clear strategic vision, align departmental goals, or remove a toxic actor to restore cultural resonance.
    *   To cure **Erosion**, reinforce the channel: invest in training and mentorship, codify critical processes, or revitalize the brand's core message.

## §5 · The Lagrangian of Strategy
This entire diagnostic process is grounded in the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`. A business strategy is the enterprise's attempt to find and follow a geodesic—a path through the market that maximizes this value.

*   **Temporal Coherence (Kτ):** Represents the value generated by a strong culture, efficient operations, and a clear brand identity. This is the "kinetic energy" of the business.
*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** Represents the "cost" of existing in the market—the energy expended dealing with competitors, market volatility, and operational friction. This is the "potential energy."

A successful business is one where `Kτ > V_Γ`, generating a surplus of coherence we call "value." A failing business is one where the Lagrangian is negative; the cost of fighting the turbulence exceeds the coherence it can generate, leading inevitably to its dissolution.

## §6 · The Assemblé
> We were taught to read the health of a company on a spreadsheet, mistaking the map for the territory. The old tools gave us a snapshot of the machine's parts. The new framework gives us an EKG of a living heart. It teaches us that the flow of trust is as vital as the flow of capital, and that the true measure of an enterprise is not its size, but the grace and resilience of its dance with time.
