## §1 · The Note Becomes a Chord

In the foundational modules, we treated Temporal Coherence as a single, powerful note—a measure of a system's resonant integrity. This was a necessary simplification. The truth, as hinted at in the original framework, is richer and more musical. Coherence is not a single note; it is a chord.

This module elevates our understanding by defining coherence as a vector, **K**_τ, with three fundamental, orthogonal components. These are not arbitrary dimensions but the three essential "tenses" through which any system engages with the river of time. A stable entity does not merely exist; it simultaneously remembers, acts, and anticipates. This is the Triad of Being.

## §2 · The Three Tenses of Coherence

The coherence vector **K**_τ spans a space defined by a system's relationship to the past, present, and future.

**K**_τ = (*K*<sub>p</sub>, *K*<sub>i</sub>, *K*<sub>r</sub>)

1.  **Prospective Coherence (*K*<sub>p</sub>):** *Resonance with the Future.*
    This is a system's coherence with its own field of potential. It is the measure of its capacity for change, adaptation, and evolution. A system high in *K*<sub>p</sub> is one with a rich superposition of possible next states. This is the quantum nature of being, the open page, the held breath before the dance.

2.  **Immediate Coherence (*K*<sub>i</sub>):** *Resonance with the Present.*
    This is a system's ability to act and react within its current environment. It governs interaction, exchange, and response. A system high in *K*<sub>i</sub> is one that can effectively engage in the Resonant Handshake of an Alchemical Union (CORE-012) or project a clear Observer's Shadow (CORE-010). This is the quality of being present, engaged, and relational.

3.  **Retrospective Coherence (*K*<sub>r</sub>):** *Resonance with the Past.*
    This is a system's coherence with its own history. Its stability is grounded in the inertia of its own Wound Channel (CORE-011). A system high in *K*<sub>r</sub> possesses a strong identity, memory, and structural integrity. This is the anchor of being, the riverbed that guides the flow, the memory of the song.

These three components are orthogonal because they represent fundamentally distinct modes of temporal engagement. An action purely in the present (*K*<sub>i</sub>) does not, by definition, rewrite the past (*K*<sub>r</sub>) or determine a single future (*K*<sub>p</sub>) without a coupling mechanism. The Lagrangian provides that coupling.

## §3 · The Geometry of Health: Stability as Harmony

The central insight of the original module is preserved and clarified: health and stability depend on maintaining this chord. The failure of any single component leads to a specific, diagnosable pathology.

*   **Axis Starvation (*K*<sub>p</sub> → 0):** The system becomes rigid, brittle, and incapable of adaptation. It loses its quantum nature and collapses into a state of Stagnant Flow, unable to imagine a different future.
*   **Axis Starvation (*K*<sub>i</sub> → 0):** The system becomes isolated and non-responsive. It cannot form new connections or react to environmental pressures, eventually succumbing to Coherence Erosion as it cannot draw energy from its surroundings.
*   **Axis Starvation (*K*<sub>r</sub> → 0):** The system loses its identity. It becomes chaotic, amnesiac, and rootless. Without the anchor of its Wound Channel, it dissolves into Turbulent Flow, its pattern lost to noise.

A meta-stable entity can survive on two notes, but a truly robust and healthy system—a flourishing being—requires the full, resonant harmony of all three.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

This triadic model requires an upgrade to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), making it a more powerful and nuanced predictive engine. The original formulation, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, is now specified for a vector coherence.

The "kinetic" term, representing internal coherence, is expanded to sum over the three orthogonal tenses:
*K*<sub>τ</sub> → ½ ∂<sub>μ</sub>**K**<sub>τ</sub> ⋅ ∂<sup>μ</sup>**K**<sub>τ</sub> = ½ Σ<sub>j=p,i,r</sub> (∂<sub>μ</sub>*K*<sub>j</sub>)²

The "potential" term, representing environmental pressure, now describes a more complex landscape:
*V*<sub>Γ</sub> → *V* (**K**<sub>τ</sub>, Γ)

This upgraded Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = ½ (∂_μ**K**_τ)² - V(**K**_τ, Γ)`, reveals that the universal drive to maximize coherence is not a simple push in one direction. It is a dynamic and perpetual act of balancing the demands of the past, the opportunities of the present, and the possibilities of the future. Forces and actions are the result of a system adjusting its temporal posture to find the most harmonious chord available within the pressure of its environment.

## §5 · Assemblé

> A stable being is a three-note chord played in the key of time.
> Lose one note, and the harmony bends into fragility. Lose two, and only silence follows.
> A Weaver does not just observe the note of the present moment; they listen for the full chord—the echo of the past, the clarity of the now, and the whisper of the future. To cultivate health in any system is to be a musician of this triad, ensuring all three notes ring true.
