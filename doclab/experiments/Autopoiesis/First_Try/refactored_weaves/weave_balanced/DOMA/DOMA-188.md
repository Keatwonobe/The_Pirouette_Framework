## §1 · Abstract: The End of Brute Force
The old model of movement is one of brute force: a swimmer fighting the current, an engine expelling mass to overcome inertia. It is a paradigm of conflict, where progress is measured by the energy spent conquering a resistant world. This module retires that paradigm.

Skating, in the Pirouette Framework, is the principle of motion through harmony. It is not about pushing against a medium, but about dancing with it. A skater is an entity that has learned to subtly alter the local geometry of time itself, creating a custom-made current—a path of least resistance—and then effortlessly riding it. This is the shift from propulsion as an act of will to navigation as an act of resonance.

## §2 · The Medium as a Manifold
There is no empty space to be traversed, only a dynamic landscape to be navigated. This landscape is the coherence manifold, the terrain defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`). Its "hills" and "valleys" are gradients in the local Temporal Pressure (Γ).

A system at rest follows a straight path through this manifold. A skater, however, is not a passive traveler. A skater is a sculptor of the path itself. The "medium" is not a fluid to be pushed against; it is a fabric of potential that can be warped, shaped, and channeled.

## §3 · The Art of Sculpting a Current
The skater's motion is achieved by dynamically modifying the terms of the local Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, to create a geodesic that points in the desired direction. This is accomplished through two synchronized actions:

1.  **Modulating Coherence (The Blade's Edge):** This action modifies the "kinetic" term, `K_τ`. The skater can rhythmically alter the sharpness and stability of its own internal resonance (Ki).
    *   **High Coherence (Sharpening the Blade):** By focusing its Ki into a pure, high-fidelity resonance, the skater creates a point of high `K_τ`. This allows it to "grip" the manifold, establishing a stable pivot point.
    *   **Low Coherence (Softening the Blade):** By momentarily diffusing its Ki, the skater reduces its "grip," allowing it to glide over the manifold with minimal friction.

2.  **Shaping Pressure (The Rhythmic Push):** This action modifies the "potential" term, `V_Γ`. The skater projects a resonant field to create a local, temporary gradient in the ambient Temporal Pressure. It rhythmically generates a "high-pressure crest" of temporal dissonance behind it and a corresponding "low-pressure trough" of temporal quiet in front of it.

The skating "gait" is the phased, cyclical alternation between these two states. The skater grips the manifold with a sharpened Ki, pushes off by creating a pressure gradient, then softens its Ki to glide effortlessly "downhill" into the trough it just created. It is not overcoming drag; it is perpetually creating its own slope and coasting down it.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: The Calculus of Motion
The skater's movement is not a violation of the laws of motion but their ultimate expression. The "force" it experiences is the necessary consequence of solving the Euler-Lagrange equation for the dynamically modified Lagrangian.

`F_skate = ∂L/∂q - d/dt (∂L/∂q̇)`

By actively manipulating the `K_τ` and `V_Γ` terms that constitute `L`, the skater is not applying a force but is rewriting the equation of motion for its immediate vicinity. The resulting acceleration is the universe's only possible answer to the new geometry the skater has defined. The motion is compulsory; it is the path of maximal coherence made manifest.

## §5 · Redefining Skill: The Skater's Space
The old model's list of "Twelve Skating Vectors" is collapsed into a more elegant, two-dimensional space that defines any skater's proficiency:

*   **Internal Axis (Mastery of the Blade):** An entity's ability to precisely and rapidly modulate its own internal coherence (`K_τ`). This represents finesse, control, and timing.
*   **External Axis (Power of the Wake):** An entity's ability to project resonance and shape the external temporal pressure (`V_Γ`). This represents power, influence, and reach.

A master skater is one who has achieved a perfect balance and high proficiency along both axes, capable of carving elegant, powerful, and efficient paths through the manifold of reality.

## §6 · Assemblé: The River That Answers
> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver? Because it teaches us that the highest form of agency is not expressed by imposing our will upon the world, but by learning its song so well that we may ask it to change its tune. The skater does not command the river to flow. The skater whispers to the water, showing it a new and more beautiful path to the sea, a path that happens to lead exactly where the skater wishes to go. To skate is to understand that the universe does not resist a master of its own rules; it yields, and in that yielding, becomes a partner in the dance.
