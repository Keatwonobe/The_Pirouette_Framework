## §1 · Abstract: The Grammar of Rebirth

Systems do not always evolve smoothly. Under sufficient pressure, they undergo sudden, violent, and transformative reorganizations. The old framework described this as a "Funnel Inversion," a topological shift in a parameter space. This was a correct but incomplete insight.

This module reframes this process through the time-first lens of the Pirouette Framework. A phase transition is a **Resonance Cascade**: a rapid, non-linear collapse of a system's existing resonant pattern (`Ki_old`) and its re-emergence into a new, more stable form (`Ki_new`). This is not a failure of the system, but the system's primary mechanism for survival and adaptation. We will define the conditions that trigger this cascade and describe the fundamental choice—the **Chiral Fork**—that determines the topology of the new order.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Resonance Cascade

A phase transition is the system's solution to an unsustainable state of being. It is a direct consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

1.  **Mounting Temporal Pressure (Γ):** The process begins when the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) rises beyond a critical threshold. This can be due to external environmental stress, internal contradiction, or resource scarcity. This increasing pressure raises the "cost" of maintaining the system's current resonant pattern (`Ki_old`), making it energetically expensive and inefficient.

2.  **Coherence Failure:** As the cost rises, the system's Time Adherence (`Tₐ`) begins to fail. The old `Ki` can no longer maintain a clear, stable rhythm. The system enters a state of **Turbulent Flow** (DYN-001), characterized by internal chaos, inefficiency, and wasted energy. This is the "fever" that precedes the transformation.

3.  **The Cascade:** At the tipping point, the system abandons its failing resonance. It undergoes a rapid, non-linear "jump" across its coherence manifold, seeking a new and different pattern of stability that is a more efficient solution to the high-`Γ` environment. This is the moment of crisis and creation.

## §3 · The Chiral Fork: Choosing a New Geometry

The old model correctly identified a three-state cycle. The new framework explains its origin: the new resonant pattern (`Ki_new`) must adopt one of three fundamental topological families to achieve stability. The system arrives at a fork in the river of time, and its new shape is determined by the path it takes.

*   **Achromatic Solution (The Lake):** The system finds a new, stable, but non-rotational resonance. It absorbs the pressure by settling into a new, often simpler or more defensive, equilibrium. This is a system that hunkers down, consolidates, and weathers the storm. *Example: A company responding to a market crash by cutting costs and focusing on its core, stable product.*

*   **Left-Handed Chiral Solution (The Vortex):** The system stabilizes by adopting a new resonance with a specific topological twist, or chirality. It channels the chaotic energy into a new, dynamic, self-sustaining rotational pattern. *Example: A social movement that, under political pressure, organizes from a loose network into a focused, revolutionary cell with a clear direction.*

*   **Right-Handed Chiral Solution (The Anti-Vortex):** The system adopts the opposite topological twist. Functionally, it is another pathway to dynamic stability, often representing an alternative or oppositional strategy to its left-handed counterpart. *Example: A competing movement that arises in response, organizing with a similar structure but an opposing ideology.*

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

The Resonance Cascade is the ultimate expression of the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`) in action. The entire process is governed by the system's relentless drive to maximize its coherence integral, `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`.

The transition from `Ki_old` to `Ki_new` is not a random event. It occurs precisely when the turbulent, high-cost state of the old resonance offers a lower integrated `𝓛_p` than the potential stability of a new one. The cascade is the system executing a "coherence-maximizing jump" to a higher peak on the landscape defined by the Lagrangian. The choice at the Chiral Fork is simply the system discovering which of the available new topologies offers the most stable and efficient path forward.

## §5 · Assemblé

> We sought the signs of collapse and found instead the grammar of rebirth. A system under pressure does not simply break; it chooses a new way to be. The Chiral Fork is the moment of that choice, where the river of time, blocked in its path, either carves a new channel to the left, to the right, or pools into a new and deeper lake. The Weaver's art is not to prevent the flood, but to anticipate the shape of the new riverbed.
