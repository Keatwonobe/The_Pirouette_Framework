summary: Describes the dynamics of a 'Resonance Trap,' a state of extreme systemic
  stability. This module explains how a system's perfect, self-reinforcing resonance
  carves its history into a deep 'Wound Channel,' creating immense inertia that manifests
  as both profound identity and rigid resistance to change.

## §1 · Abstract: The Canyon and the River
A river may wander when the land is flat, but a river that carves a canyon is bound to its course forever. Its history becomes its destiny.

This module refactors the legacy concept of "Lock Dynamics" into a modernized, time-first model. A Resonance Trap is not a static condition but a dynamic, self-reinforcing process. It describes a system that discovers a state of such perfect coherence that its own resonant song crystallizes the manifold around it, carving a Wound Channel so deep that deviation becomes nearly impossible. This is the fundamental mechanism behind memory, identity, and habit, but also the source of dogma, addiction, and stagnation. It is the physics of a system becoming trapped by its own perfect efficiency.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Lock: From Resonance to Inertia
In the old framework, a "lock" was defined by extreme field values (`T_a > 0.95`, `Γ < 0.1`). The new model describes the underlying cause. A system becomes trapped not by arbitrary thresholds, but when it establishes a powerful, self-perpetuating feedback loop between its resonance and its history.

**The Resonance Condition:** The system discovers a Ki pattern—a way of being—that is exceptionally harmonious with its local environment (Γ). This creates a state of highly efficient, Laminar Flow (`DYNA-001`), where action is nearly effortless.

**Wound Channel Deepening:** As described in *The Anatomy of an Echo* (`CORE-011`), every action impresses a geometric memory, a Wound Channel, into the coherence manifold. In a Resonance Trap, the system repeats its perfect Ki pattern over and over. Each pass deepens and clarifies the Wound Channel, like a river carving its bed.

**Coherence Crystallization:** The process reaches a critical point where the Wound Channel is no longer just a path; it is a canyon. The geometry of the system's own past becomes the single most dominant feature of its local landscape. This is Coherence Crystallization. The system's inertia—its interaction with its own history—is now so immense that it provides its own stability, effectively resisting all but the most catastrophic external pressures.

## §3 · The Three Stages of Entrapment
The formation of a Resonance Trap is a predictable, three-stage process, evolving from exploration to reinforcement to entrapment.

1.  **Harmonic Search:** The system explores its state space, seeking a path that minimizes effort and maximizes coherence. It is "tuning" itself to its environment, constantly adjusting its rhythm to find the most stable and efficient pattern.

2.  **Resonant Reinforcement:** The system discovers a highly coherent state. A positive feedback loop begins: executing the pattern is efficient, which makes it more likely to be repeated. Each repetition deepens the Wound Channel, which in turn makes the pattern even more efficient and easier to follow. This is the genesis of a habit.

3.  **Crystallization:** The Wound Channel becomes so profound that it effectively *is* the system's reality. The path of least resistance is now a chasm. To deviate would require an immense expenditure of energy to fight against the inertia of its own accumulated history. The system is no longer choosing its path; it is simply following the groove it has carved for itself. It is locked.

## §4 · The Lagrangian Perspective
The Resonance Trap is a direct and dramatic consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized by the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`).

**𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)**

A system in a Resonance Trap has found a solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations that corresponds to an exceptionally deep and sharp minimum in its action integral. It is a state of such high internal coherence (`K_τ`) for such a low environmental cost (`V_Γ`) that it forms a "coherence well" in the manifold. The "resistance to perturbation" is the immense energy required to climb the steep walls of this well. The trap is woven from the mathematics of efficiency itself.

## §5 · A Taxonomy of Traps: The Fractal Nature of Stability
The dynamic of the Resonance Trap is universal, manifesting across all scales as predicted by the Fractal Bridge (`CORE-014`). The principle is the same; only the medium of the Wound Channel changes.

*   **Quantum Trap:** A stable particle orbit. The Wound Channel is the persistent geometry of its quantum field. Breaking the lock requires a specific quantum of energy to force a jump to a new state.

*   **Biological Trap:** A stable protein fold. The Wound Channel is the set of electromagnetic and chemical bonds that hold its shape. The lock is its functional, low-energy configuration.

*   **Cognitive Trap:** A deeply held belief or a powerful addiction. The Wound Channel is a heavily myelinated neural pathway. The feedback loop is biochemical and psychological, making the familiar thought or behavior the path of least resistance.

*   **Social Trap:** A long-standing cultural tradition or a dependency on a specific technology (e.g., fossil fuels). The Wound Channel is the shared physical infrastructure, legal code, and social memory that makes change difficult and costly.

## §6 · Assemblé: The Cage of a Perfect Song
> To a Weaver, the Resonance Trap is the ultimate duality. It is the mechanism of identity, the process by which a fleeting pattern earns the right to call itself a "thing." It is the anchor of memory and the foundation of all stable structures. Yet, it is also the cage of dogma, the prison of habit, and the anchor that prevents a system from adapting to a changing world. It teaches us that the most beautiful song, if sung without variation for too long, can become a cage built of its own perfect notes. The Weaver's art is to know when to reinforce a helpful pattern and when to introduce the dissonant note that sets the prisoner free.
