## §1 · Abstract: The End of the Song
The old science saw collapse as a breakage, a structural failure in a machine. This view is insufficient. A system does not merely break; it first forgets its own song.

This module reframes the analysis of system failure through the time-first principles of the Pirouette Framework. Collapse is the terminal stage of a flow pathology, as diagnosed by the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003). It is a state where a system's internal coherence is so compromised that it can no longer successfully navigate the landscape of temporal pressure. Its resonant pattern dissolves, its memory frays, and its identity is ceded back to the chaos of the Temporal Forge. This is not a mechanical event; it is the end of a coherent story.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of Failure
The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006) defines the universal drive of any system: to find and follow the path of maximal coherence. A healthy system is one that has found a stable, efficient solution to this cosmic imperative.

Collapse is the ultimate consequence of a system losing this solution. When the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) becomes too great, or when a system's internal Temporal Coherence (Kτ) degrades, the path of maximal coherence no longer leads to stability but to dissolution. The feedback loops that once maintained its form become accelerants for its own unraveling. The system is no longer solving for existence; it is solving for zero.

## §3 · The Three Paths to Ruin
Applying the Caduceus Lens to a dying system reveals that collapse is not a single event, but the terminal destination of one of three distinct pathological journeys.

1.  **The Turbulent Death (Coherence Fever):**
    This is a rapid, violent, and chaotic collapse. The system is consumed by a storm of internal dissonance, wasting all its energy fighting itself. This corresponds to the old model's "Critical Collapse" in its most explosive form.
    *   **Dynamics:** A state of runaway Turbulent Flow where positive feedback loops amplify chaos exponentially.
    *   **Manifestations:** A financial market crash fueled by panic; a runaway nuclear reaction; a violent political revolution; an acute psychotic break.

2.  **The Stagnant Death (Coherence Atrophy):**
    This is a collapse born of paralysis and starvation. A critical flow is blocked, creating a "coherence dam." Pressure builds until the system either implodes or fractures, while downstream functions wither from lack of input.
    *   **Dynamics:** A terminal state of Stagnant Flow where a critical blockage causes catastrophic, cascading failures.
    *   **Manifestations:** The collapse of a civilization due to supply chain failure; a company going bankrupt from bureaucratic gridlock; a massive heart attack caused by a blocked artery.

3.  **The Silent Fraying (Coherence Erosion):**
    This is the slow, often unnoticed death by a thousand cuts. It is the steady, relentless victory of entropy. The system's Wound Channel (its memory and identity) gradually loses its definition, becoming more susceptible to ambient noise until it can no longer hold its pattern. This corresponds to the old "Silent Collapse."
    *   **Dynamics:** The slow degradation of the system's Ki pattern, where small, uncorrected errors accumulate over time.
    *   **Manifestations:** The slow decay of an ancient empire through cultural rot; the fading of a skill through disuse; chronic degenerative disease; the gradual erosion of trust in an institution.

The reversibility of a collapse—what was once termed 'Elastic' vs. 'Critical'—is a question of the Wound Channel's integrity. If the core memory of the system's healthy state is preserved, recovery is possible. If that channel is irrevocably erased, the collapse is final.

## §4 · Diagnostic Protocol: The Anatomy of Ruin
To understand a collapse is to perform a pre-mortem or a post-mortem using the principles of flow.

1.  **Map the Currents:** Identify the system's vital flows—energy, resources, information, trust—that defined its healthy, laminar state.
2.  **Identify the Fracture:** Diagnose the primary failure mode. Was it a sudden storm (Turbulence), a critical blockage (Stagnation), or a slow decay (Erosion)?
3.  **Trace the Cascade:** Chart how the initial fracture propagated through the system. How did the failure of one current starve or overwhelm another? This reveals the system's hidden interdependencies and vulnerabilities.
4.  **Assess the Wound Channel:** Examine the remnants of the system's identity. Is the memory of its healthy pattern recoverable? This final step determines whether the task ahead is one of healing or of composing something new from the ruins.

## §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian
Collapse is the ultimate manifestation of the Pirouette Lagrangian's dynamic principle. The Euler-Lagrange equations derived from 𝓛_p describe the trajectory a system *must* take to maximize coherence. When a system's parameters shift such that no stable, coherent path is available, those same equations of motion will describe a trajectory towards a state of zero coherence—dissolution. Failure is not an exception to the law; it is a lawful and predictable outcome when the conditions for stable resonance are no longer met. The universe, through this principle, is as elegant in its dismantling of forms as it is in their creation.

## §6 · Assemblé
> To be a Weaver is to be a gardener of coherence. But a gardener who only studies the bloom and not the rot is a fool. To understand the fracture in the flow is to learn the profound and terrible humility of form. We learn that things do not simply break; they lose their reason to hold together. By studying the anatomy of a song's end, we learn how to better tend to the music while it still plays.
