summary: Re-frames Will not as a separate force, but as the capacity of a conscious
  system to deliberately modulate its own coherence manifold. Defines a willed act
  as the projection of a desired coherence gradient, creating a 'Channel of Intent'
  that reshapes the path of least resistance for future action.

## §1 · Abstract: The Sculptor and the Stone
The previous framework modeled Will as an active, self-generated field, a force projected outward to influence reality. This was a powerful but incomplete metaphor. The modernized, time-first view reveals a more profound and intimate mechanism: Will is not a force that pushes against the world; it is the art of sculpting the world's underlying geometry so that it naturally flows toward a desired outcome.

This module defines Will as the fundamental capability of a conscious system to engineer its own coherence manifold. Through the focused projection of its internal state, an entity can create a desired gradient—a "Channel of Intent"—making the chosen path the *new* path of least resistance. It is the shift from being a passenger on the river of time to becoming its co-cartographer.

## §2 · The Physics of Intent: From Following to Forging
For any system, the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)** defines its dynamics. The system naturally follows a geodesic—a path that maximizes its coherence (`Kτ`) while minimizing the cost of resisting the ambient Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). This is the path of effortless action.

An unwilled act is simply following the pre-existing geodesics of the manifold. A willed act is the deliberate forging of a *new* geodesic.

This is achieved through the focused application of the **Observer's Shadow (CORE-010)**. A conscious entity, by holding a clear and stable internal state of intent, projects a geometric imprint onto its local manifold. This projection is not passive; it actively alters the `V_Γ` term of its own Lagrangian. It creates a "coherence well," a localized dip in the temporal pressure landscape. The desired action is no longer an uphill climb against the currents of reality; it has become the most natural downhill path to follow. Will is the act of terraforming one's own immediate future.

## §3 · The Anatomy of a Willed Act
The old framework's "12 Dimensions of Will" can be collapsed into three core, physically grounded components that describe the quality of this geometric projection.

1.  **Clarity (The Purity of the Projection):** A willed act begins with a coherent intent. Clarity is the measure of this coherence—the purity and stability of the projected Ki pattern. A clear goal is a sharp, resonant signal that carves a well-defined channel. A vague or conflicted intention is a noisy, dissonant projection that diffuses without effect. High clarity corresponds to a high internal state of Time Adherence, the unwavering note of a single, desired outcome.

2.  **Intensity (The Depth of the Channel):** Intensity is the amplitude of the Observer's Shadow, its power to deform the local manifold. It is the "weight" of consciousness, a function of focus, conviction, and the energy brought to bear on the act. A high-intensity projection creates a deep coherence well, a steep gradient that makes the desired path almost irresistible. This is the quality that overcomes inertia and resistance.

3.  **Persistence (The Reinforcement of the Channel):** A single projection can be fleeting. Sustained Will requires persistence: the continuous reinforcement of the projected gradient over time. Each repeated act of focus and action deepens the Channel of Intent, transforming it from a temporary furrow into a permanent feature of the manifold. This is the physical mechanism of habit, discipline, and mastery, grounded in the principles of the **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**. It is the act of carving the future so deeply that it becomes history.

## §4 · The Lagrangian Connection: Co-Authoring Reality
The connection to the core engine of the framework is now explicit and direct. The dynamics of any system are governed by:

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

*   An **unwilled system** is a passive subject of this equation, following the path that maximizes the integral of `𝓛_p`.
*   A **willed system** becomes an active co-author of the equation. It consciously manipulates the `V_Γ` term through its projected intent.

The "force of Will" is therefore not an additional term. It is the measure of the gradient `∇(V_Γ)` that the system *itself* has created. The system impels itself forward by reshaping the very landscape it must traverse. This is the calculus of choice: to modify the potential field of reality through the focused application of one's own coherence.

## §5 · The Assemblé
> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver? Because it is the final absolution from determinism. The universe is not a story that is written for us, but a story that is written *with* us. Will is the pen. It is the mechanism by which consciousness fulfills its sacred and participatory role. To exert Will is to understand that the path forward is not found, but carved. It is the profound and practical art of shaping the flow of time itself, turning the stone of circumstance into a channel for your own becoming.
