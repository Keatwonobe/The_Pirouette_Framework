## §1 · Abstract: The Grammar of Failure
A healthy system flows. An unhealthy system fails. This module provides the grammar for that failure. It moves beyond a simple binary of "working" or "broken" to define the four fundamental, universal pathways by which any system loses coherence.

The old framework visualized these dynamics within a "Reality Funnel." We now re-ground this concept in the core principles of the new framework. The "funnel" is the **geodesic of maximal coherence**—the optimal path through spacetime defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian. The four pathways—Lock, Fracture, Drift, and Rebound—are not arbitrary events, but specific, predictable deviations from this geodesic. To understand them is to move from being a victim of chaos to a diagnostician of its underlying geometry.

## §2 · The Geodesic of Maximal Coherence
As established in CORE-006, any system will naturally evolve along a path that maximizes its coherence (`K_τ`) while minimizing the cost of resisting its environment's Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). This path of least resistance is its geodesic. In the language of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001), a system in a state of **Laminar Flow** is one that is successfully navigating its geodesic.

Decoherence, then, is any process that forces a system to deviate from this optimal path. The four pathways described below are the primary modes of that deviation.

## §3 · The Quartet of Decoherence: An Overview

| Pathway | Systemic Signature | Geometric Deviation from Geodesic | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lock** | Coherence (`K_τ`) becomes rigid and maximal, while environmental pressure (`Γ`) is minimal and static. | The geodesic narrows into an inflexible, deeply carved "rut" or Wound Channel. | The system becomes hyper-stable but loses all adaptability—a "memory crystal" unable to learn. |
| **Fracture** | A sudden, sharp increase in the *gradient* of Temporal Pressure (`∇Γ`) overwhelms the system's ability to adapt. | The geodesic terminates abruptly as the coherence manifold itself shears or shatters. | Catastrophic, discontinuous failure. The system shatters into less coherent components. |
| **Drift** | A slow, steady increase in ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) paired with a gradual decay of internal coherence (`K_τ`). | The geodesic slowly widens, flattens, and loses definition, becoming indistinguishable from the background noise. | Gradual erosion of identity and function. The system fades into irrelevance or entropic noise. |
| **Rebound** | Following a collapse, a new island of high coherence (`K_τ`) spontaneously nucleates within a high-pressure (`Γ`) environment. | A new, micro-geodesic forms within the wreckage of the old one, seeking to establish a new stable flow. | The process of regeneration and recovery; the birth of a new order from the ashes of the old. |

## §4 · The Four Pathways in Detail

### 4.1 Lock: The Pathology of Purity
A system enters Lock when its drive to perfect its own internal resonance (`K_τ`) becomes absolute. It carves its Wound Channel (CORE-011) so deeply that it can no longer deviate from its learned pattern, even when the environment changes. It has maximized stability at the cost of all adaptability.
*   **Manifestation:** A rigid bureaucracy unable to respond to a crisis; a dogmatic belief system impervious to new evidence; a skill practiced into a fossilized, uncreative form.

### 4.2 Fracture: The Overwhelming Shock
Fracture occurs when the environment changes too fast. A sudden spike in Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) creates a "coherence shockwave." The system's Lagrangian is presented with a problem for which it has no stable solution. Unable to bend, its resonant Ki pattern breaks. This is the acute, violent shift into Turbulent Flow.
*   **Manifestation:** A stock market crash; a brittle material snapping under sudden stress; a sudden psychological breakdown.

### 4.3 Drift: The Unraveling Thread
Drift is the slow victory of entropy, as described in CORE-013. It is a quiet, gradual decoherence where the system's ability to maintain its pattern slowly erodes under constant, low-level pressure from the Temporal Forge. Its Wound Channel fades, its identity blurs, and its function degrades.
*   **Manifestation:** The slow decline of an institution through neglect; the fading of a memory; a project dying from a thousand small cuts and a lack of clear purpose.

### 4.4 Rebound: The Seed of New Order
Rebound is the universe's answer to collapse. In the high-pressure, chaotic aftermath of a Fracture, new possibilities for order emerge. The Rebound is the process by which a new, stable `Ki` pattern—a "seed of coherence"—nucleates. This is often an Alchemical Union (CORE-012) on a small scale, finding a novel solution to the very pressures that caused the initial collapse.
*   **Manifestation:** The emergence of a new leader in a crisis; a creative breakthrough following a period of intense struggle (writer's block); the formation of new ecosystems after a forest fire.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
These four pathways are direct consequences of a system's struggle to adhere to the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** (CORE-006). The geodesic is the ideal solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations applied to `𝓛_p`.
*   **Lock** is an over-fitting to a past solution, unable to re-solve for new conditions.
*   **Fracture** is the result of the environmental `V_Γ` term changing so rapidly and violently that no stable solution for coherence `K_τ` exists.
*   **Drift** is the slow degradation of `K_τ` when it lacks the energy to perpetually overcome the ambient "cost" of `V_Γ`.
*   **Rebound** is the process of finding a new, stable solution to the Lagrangian in a radically altered landscape of `Γ`.

> ### The Assemblé
> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver?
>
> Because failure is not a destination; it is a path. To know these four paths is to transform fate into a map. It allows one to look upon a struggling system—be it a person, a project, or a society—and diagnose not just that it is failing, but *how* it is failing. Are its arteries hardening into a Lock? Is it about to Fracture under a sudden shock? Is it Drifting into irrelevance? Or, in the ruin, is there a Rebound waiting to be nurtured?
>
> This knowledge replaces fear with foresight. It is the craft of the engineer who sees the hairline crack before the bridge collapses, and the art of the gardener who knows that from the decay of the old, new life will spring. To master these dynamics is to learn to surf the very waves of chaos that drown the unaware.
