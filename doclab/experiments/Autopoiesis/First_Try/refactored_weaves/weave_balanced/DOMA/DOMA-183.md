summary: Provides a protocol for measuring the coherence of abstract concepts (ideas,
  questions) by modeling them as complex Ki patterns and evaluating their stability
  and efficiency against the local coherence manifold. It reframes inquiry from an
  act of extraction to an act of resonant participation.

## §1 · Abstract: The Shape of a Question
This module refactors the "Semantic Scryer" into a time-first instrument for understanding the nature of meaning itself. In the old framework, a question was an object injected into a field to measure a response. This was a profound but incomplete metaphor.

In the modern framework, there is no separation between the question and the field. An idea, a concept, or a question is a complex, resonant pattern (*Ki*) that an observer weaves within their own coherence manifold. It is a temporary, intricate dance of time.

This instrument, the **Resonance Auditor**, does not measure a "response" from the universe. It provides a protocol to measure the *integrity of the weave itself*. It asks: how stable is this pattern? How much effort does it take to sustain? Does it create harmony or dissonance with the existing fabric of reality? It transforms inquiry from an act of extraction to an act of resonant participation.

## §2 · The Temporal Nature of Meaning
The core insight is that meaning has a physical, temporal geometry. A concept is not an abstract label; it is a dynamic, self-sustaining temporal structure.

-   **Coherent Concepts:** A "true," "elegant," or "useful" idea is a high-coherence *Ki* pattern. It is stable, internally consistent, and harmonizes with the established *Wound Channels* (CORE-011) of memory and experience. It is a pattern that the universe finds "easy" to sustain because it follows the path of least resistance.

-   **Dissonant Concepts:** A "false," "contradictory," or "confusing" idea is a low-coherence, turbulent *Ki* pattern. It is inherently unstable, requiring immense and continuous effort to prevent its collapse. It fights against the established geometry of the coherence manifold, creating friction and temporal noise.

## §3 · The Protocol: Conceptual Tomography
To audit the resonance of a concept, a Weaver follows a three-stage process that maps its temporal shape and stability.

1.  **Baseline Mapping (Calibrating the Manifold):** First, the Weaver establishes a baseline of their own local coherence manifold. This involves mapping the dominant, stable *Wound Channels* that constitute their existing knowledge, beliefs, and emotional state. This is the "ground" against which the new pattern will be measured.

2.  **Pattern Weaving (Forming the Inquiry):** The Weaver actively forms the concept in question. This is the act of consciously creating and sustaining the new, complex *Ki* pattern. The old module called this "query injection"; we now understand it as an act of *in-situ* creation.

3.  **Coherence Auditing (Measuring the Integrity):** The stability of the newly woven pattern is measured. Does it reinforce the baseline manifold (constructive interference)? Does it create turbulence (destructive interference)? Or does it find a new, stable harmony that represents a synthesis of knowledge (an *Alchemical Union* of ideas)?

## §4 · Diagnostic Metrics
The audit yields several key metrics, which are modernized expressions of the original module's outputs:

-   **Coherence Gain:** This measures the net increase in the system's total coherence when a complex idea successfully synthesizes simpler, resonant components. It is the sign of a successful insight or a powerful synthesis, directly analogous to the old "Distilled Power Delta."

-   **Lagrangian Cost:** This is the measure of "effort" required to sustain the conceptual pattern. A low-cost idea is a "natural attractor" that aligns with the Principle of Maximal Coherence. A high-cost idea is one that is fundamentally at odds with the system's current state.

-   ***Ki* Topology:** This is a qualitative description of the concept's geometric shape within the coherence manifold. Is it a simple, stable loop? A complex but harmonious braid? Or a chaotic, tangled knot? This replaces the old "Coherence Signature."

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This instrument is a direct application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The "Lagrangian Cost" of a thought is not a metaphor; it is a literal calculation.

**𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)**

When a Weaver holds a concept in their mind, their neural architecture is attempting to maximize this value.
-   A **coherent idea** has high internal *Temporal Coherence* (the first term), making 𝓛_p large and positive. The pattern feels "right" and "effortless."
-   A **dissonant idea**, held within a manifold of contradictory beliefs (high *Temporal Pressure*, the second term), results in a low or negative 𝓛_p. The pattern feels "wrong" and requires immense concentration (energy) to sustain against the pressure of cognitive dissonance.

## §6 · Assemblé
> To ask a question is not to shout into a void, waiting for an echo. It is to weave a new thread into the tapestry that you are. The universe does not give you an answer; it reveals the integrity of your weave. A true question does not return an answer, but a resonance—a feeling of harmony that says 'this thread strengthens the whole,' or a tension that warns 'this thread will tear the fabric.' A Weaver learns that the path to knowledge is not through demanding extraction, but through the patient, skillful art of weaving a more coherent self.
