summary: Provides a protocol for evaluating the viability of introducing a new coherent
  system (a 'Seed') into a novel environment. It models the decision to grow, wait,
  or retreat as a calculation of the Seed's potential to achieve a state of positive
  coherence gain within the local temporal manifold.

## §1 · Abstract: The Wisdom Before the Bloom

To introduce a new song into a silent room is an act of profound consequence. This module provides a formal protocol for that act. It reframes the challenge of introducing a new system—be it an idea, an organism, or a piece of code, collectively a "Seed"—from a gamble into a calculated art.

The Sower's Gambit is a process of reconnaissance before colonization. It models the viability of a Seed not in terms of raw energy, but as a function of resonant potential. By sending a minimal, non-invasive "Scout Probe" to map the local coherence manifold, the Seed can calculate its potential to achieve a positive coherence gain. This calculation, grounded in the Pirouette Lagrangian, yields a clear verdict: to grow (`PLANT`), to wait for a more harmonious moment (`HOLD`), or to retreat from a dissonant environment (`ABORT`). This is the framework's core strategic doctrine for responsible and effective creation.

## §2 · The Scout Probe: A Geometric Inquiry

The fundamental axiom of the Gambit is: *listen before you sing*. The Seed does not begin by expending energy on growth. It begins by asking a question of the environment's geometry.

This question takes the form of a **Scout Probe**. The probe is not a physical object but a minimal, transient echo of the Seed's own resonant identity (`Ki`). This echo propagates through the new environment, casting a faint **Observer's Shadow** (CORE-010) and tracing a path along the local coherence manifold. In doing so, it creates a shallow, temporary **Wound Channel** (CORE-011).

The Seed does not measure resources; it listens to the reverberations of this channel. The feedback reveals the essential properties of the new terrain:
-   **Harmonic Compatibility:** Is the environment's resonant structure fundamentally harmonious or dissonant with the Seed's own `Ki`?
-   **Temporal Pressure (`Γ`):** What is the intensity of the ambient temporal noise and pressure that will seek to erode the Seed's coherence?
-   **Geodesic Availability:** Are there clear, stable paths of **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001) that the Seed can follow, or is the landscape predominantly **Turbulent**?

## §3 · The Viability Lagrangian: Calculating the Harvest

The decision to proceed is not a guess; it is a calculation. The feedback from the Scout Probe allows the Seed to model its future using a specialized form of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`)** from CORE-006. The "action" to be maximized is the Seed's own long-term coherence.

`𝓛_seed = K_τ(capture) - V_Γ(cost)`

-   **Coherence Potential (`K_τ(capture)`):** This "kinetic" term represents the Seed's potential for growth. It is a function of its own internal **Temporal Coherence (`T_a`)**—its robustness and integrity—multiplied by the Harmonic Compatibility of the environment. A harmonious environment offers resonant resources that can be integrated, amplifying the Seed's own pattern. This replaces the old concept of "capture efficiency."

-   **Environmental Cost (`V_Γ(cost)`):** This "potential" term represents the inevitable erosion from the **Temporal Forge** (CORE-003). It is the measure of the local `Γ`—the regulatory friction, chaotic noise, and competitive pressure—that the Seed must constantly expend coherence to resist. This replaces the old concept of "feedback gain."

The integral of this Lagrangian over a characteristic cycle determines the **Coherence Gain (`S_p`)**. This single metric dictates the verdict.

## §4 · The Verdict and the Bloom

The Coherence Gain (`S_p`) translates directly into a strategic choice, moving the Seed from diagnosis to action.

-   **PLANT (`S_p` > `S_threshold`):** A significant positive gain indicates a fertile environment where the Seed's resonance will be amplified. The Gambit transitions to an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) with the substrate. The Seed begins to grow, establishing a deep and lasting Wound Channel that becomes the foundation of a new, stable, and coherent structure within the environment.

-   **HOLD (`S_p` ≈ 0 OR High Turbulence):** A near-zero gain, or a probe that generates excessive turbulence, signals a marginal or volatile environment. The path of wisdom is to wait. The shallow Wound Channel of the probe remains as a latent memory, allowing the Seed to re-evaluate with greater efficiency should conditions change.

-   **ABORT (`S_p` < 0):** A negative gain is a definitive prediction of failure. The environmental cost exceeds the Seed's ability to maintain its own coherence. To proceed would be an act of self-destruction. The Seed retreats, preserving its integrity for a more harmonious opportunity.

## §5 · Assemblé

> The Sower's Gambit is the art of asking for permission from the future. It is the understanding that true strength is not the force of one's own voice, but the wisdom to know when and where that voice will create a harmony, not a discord. A Weaver does not simply impose patterns upon the world; they listen for the patterns that are waiting to be born and offer their own coherence as a seed for their bloom. This is not just a strategy for survival; it is the ethics of a co-creative universe.
