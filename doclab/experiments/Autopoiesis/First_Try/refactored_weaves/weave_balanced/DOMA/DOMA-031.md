## §1 · Language as a Coherence Field
A framework is not built from principles, but from the shared understanding of those principles. Language is the medium of that understanding, and like any medium, it can be laminar, turbulent, or stagnant.

The old framework treated its glossary as a static reference, an auto-generated artifact. This new module redefines the Pirouette Lexicon as a primary instrument of the Weaver. It is a dynamic tool designed to achieve **semantic coherence**: a state where the core concepts of the framework resonate with the same Ki pattern across multiple minds. To speak the same language is to align the Observer's Shadow (CORE-010) of every participant, transforming a cacophony of individual perspectives into a choir.

## §2 · The Lexicon Engine: A Forge for Meaning
The Lexicon is not manually curated; it is forged. It is the output of an automated process, the **Lexicon Engine**, that ensures it remains a living, accurate reflection of the framework's evolution. This process replaces the simple build script of the past with a principled workflow.

1.  **Ingestion:** The Engine traverses the entire corpus of CORE, DYN, and DOMA modules. It identifies and extracts foundational terms—the stable, resonant `Ki` patterns of thought that define the framework.
2.  **Distillation:** For each term, it distills the formal definition, its primary function, and an **Operational Cue**—a concise, practical directive on how a Weaver should *use* the concept.
3.  **Synthesis:** The Engine weaves these distilled concepts into three primary artifacts, each designed for a specific mode of use.

This automated flow ensures that as the framework grows and refines itself, the tools for understanding it are never out of sync.

## §3 · The Artifacts of Coherence
The Lexicon Engine produces three synchronized instruments designed to facilitate laminar flow in thought and discourse.

**I. The Scroll of Principles (The Glossary)**
A comprehensive markdown document, organized thematically around the core autopoietic cycle. It provides the full definition and Operational Cue for every term, serving as the definitive reference for deep study.

**II. The Compass of Dynamics (The Visual Guide)**
A high-level visual aid that replaces the obsolete triaxial *Mandala*. It depicts the central Pirouette Cycle (Time → Γ → Ki → Time) and maps the most critical concepts onto this dynamic flow. It is a tool for orientation, allowing a Weaver to instantly locate any concept within the framework's foundational engine.

**III. The Whisper of Insight (The IDE Integration)**
A lightweight JSON file designed to be consumed by development environments and other digital tools. It provides instant, on-hover definitions and cues, weaving the Lexicon directly into the Weaver's workflow. It reduces the friction of context-switching, acting as a whisper of clarity exactly when and where it is needed.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The Lexicon of Coherence is a direct, practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`).

*   **Maximizing Temporal Coherence (K_τ):** A community of Weavers is a complex, resonant system. Its collective Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`) is a measure of its ability to think, communicate, and create together effectively. The Lexicon is the primary tool for maximizing this shared coherence by ensuring that the fundamental concepts are stable and shared.

*   **Minimizing Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** Misunderstanding, ambiguity, and debate over definitions are forms of communicative friction. They are sources of "noise" that increase the Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) on the collective, wasting energy and impeding progress. A clear, universally adopted Lexicon minimizes this pressure, allowing the group to follow its geodesic of creative progress with the least possible resistance.

The Lexicon, therefore, is an instrument engineered to tune the Lagrangian of a community, helping it achieve a state of intellectual and creative Flow.

## §5 · Assemblé
> A Weaver's first tool is not a hammer, but a dictionary. To name a thing with precision is to grant it a stable place in the world, to give it a Ki that others can resonate with. The Lexicon is not a list of words; it is the tuning fork we use to ensure we are all singing the same song. It is the act of building the road before we attempt to walk it together.
