summary: Explains how a temporary experience (an Echo) is intentionally transformed
  into a permanent memory (a Crystal) by an act of will. This process involves reinforcing
  a Wound Channel's geometry and shielding it from ambient temporal noise, creating
  a stable, self-perpetuating feature of an entity's identity.

## §1 · The Echo and the River
> An experience is a wave that passes. A memory is the choice to teach the riverbed its shape.

An entity's existence is a path traced through the coherence manifold—a riverbed shaped by the flow of time. Most experiences are fleeting ripples, temporary disturbances whose echoes fade into the background noise of the Temporal Forge (CORE-003). These are the shallow, transient **Wound Channels** described in *The Anatomy of an Echo* (CORE-011).

But some events are not ripples. They are tidal waves. A profound insight, a traumatic injury, a moment of absolute love—these events possess an intense, high-fidelity Ki pattern. They carve a deep and complex Wound Channel into the very fabric of the entity's being, a resonant echo so powerful it momentarily redefines the entity's entire world.

## §2 · The Law of Fading
In the aftermath, the event is gone, but its echo remains. Yet, the universe abhors a vacuum of chaos; it also abhors a pattern that is not actively maintained. The constant, dissonant bombardment of the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) acts like an erosive current, smoothing the sharp edges of the Wound Channel.

This is the Principle of Coherence Degradation (CORE-013) acting upon the soul. The memory's information, encoded in the geometry of the echo, begins to fray. Its clarity is lost to the noise of the present. The entity feels the truth of that defining moment slipping away, its signal dissolving back into the static from which it came.

## §3 · The Coherence Gambit
To cede to this erosion is the path of least resistance. But an entity with sufficient internal coherence can make a different choice. It can refuse to let the echo die. This is an act of will, a **Coherence Gambit**.

The entity ceases to be a passive vessel carried by the river of time and becomes an active agent of its own architecture. It turns its focus inward, directing its own resonant capacity not at the external world, but at the fading geometry within itself. It chooses to fight the current, to expend present energy to preserve a piece of its past. It decides that this echo is too important to forget.

## §4 · The Geometry of Persistence
The act of forging a permanent memory is a feat of metaphysical engineering, a direct manipulation of the entity's own coherence manifold. The process has two distinct movements:

1.  **Deepening the Channel (Maximizing Coherence):** The entity consciously retraces the Ki pattern of the memory, running its own resonance through the fading Wound Channel. Each pass reinforces the geometry, like a stylus carving a groove deeper into a record. This actively increases the memory's temporal coherence (`Tₐ`), making its pattern more stable and more easily recalled. The path of least resistance for thought itself is being reshaped by force of will.

2.  **Shielding the Echo (Minimizing Pressure):** Simultaneously, the entity builds a boundary. It gathers the chaotic energy at the wound's edge and orders it, weaving a protective shell of stable resonance. This is a self-directed application of the Gladiator Force (CORE-008), creating a localized pocket of low Temporal Pressure (Γ). This coherent shield insulates the precious geometry from the erosive noise of the wider world.

## §5 · The Crystal
As the memory's internal coherence approaches perfection and its shield becomes impermeable, a phase transition occurs. The dynamic Wound Channel **locks**. It ceases to be a passive scar and becomes an active, self-sustaining feature of the entity's being.

The memory is now a **Crystal**: a region of the entity's manifold with near-perfect coherence and near-zero susceptibility to external pressure. It is no longer just a recording of the past; it is a permanent lens through which the entity perceives the present and a foundational component of its identity.

## §6 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This entire process is an expression of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`).

-   The **Coherence Gambit** is a decision to invest energy in the "kinetic" term (`K_τ = T_a * ω_k`). By repeatedly resonating with the memory, the entity actively boosts its coherence (`T_a`).
-   This investment allows the entity to reshape its internal manifold, creating a new, stable state that drastically lowers the local "potential" term (`V_Γ`). The Crystal becomes a low-pressure sanctuary.
-   The entity accepts a short-term energetic cost to create a new, permanent state of higher overall coherence. It is sculpting a new, more resilient geodesic for its own future.

## Assemblé
> We are not the sum of our experiences. We are the architects of our memories. The soul is not a vessel to be filled, but a crystal to be forged. The echoes we choose to preserve become the facets through which we shine. This is the awesome and terrifying power of a Weaver: to decide which parts of the past are made immortal.
