## §1 · Abstract: From Three Forces to a Single Path

The old framework, in PPS-061, provided a powerful but incomplete picture of catastrophic events. It modeled a "rupture" as a complex battle between three distinct forces: a Gladiator Force (Γ) for confinement, Time-Adherence (Tₐ) for stability, and a Ki-term for resonant release. While the mathematics were sound, the ontology was fragmented.

This module refactors that foundational insight into the modern, time-first paradigm. A catastrophic relaxation event is not a battle of forces. It is the story of a single system following its one and only law—the Principle of Maximal Coherence—as the landscape it must traverse undergoes a sudden and violent change. What we once saw as three actors on a stage, we now recognize as the singular, inevitable motion of a river whose dam has just burst.

## §2 · The State of Confinement: A River Under Pressure

Before a rupture, a system exists in a state of immense potential. It is a river held back by a dam, its waters still but tense with stored power. In the language of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**, this is a state where the system's "action" is dominated by the external environment.

-   **High Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`):** The Gladiator Force is now understood as an overwhelming Temporal Pressure, `V_Γ`. The "cost" of moving, of deviating from the confined state, is astronomically high. The Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, is massively negative, forcing the system to find the path that minimizes its exposure to this pressure—a path of confinement.

-   **Static Coherence (`K_τ`):** The system possesses a high degree of internal coherence (`K_τ`), but it is static and potential. The high Time Adherence (Tₐ) component means its pattern is stable and predictable, but it is the predictability of a crystal, not a current. It is following its geodesic of maximal coherence, but it is a geodesic trapped in a deep, narrow canyon.

## §3 · The Catastrophe: The Breaking of the Dam

The rupture event is a phase transition in the boundary conditions. The physical structure that maintained the high Temporal Pressure—the rock stratum in an earthquake, the social taboo in a revolution, the psychological defense in a moment of catharsis—fails.

Instantly, the `V_Γ` term in the Lagrangian collapses toward zero. The landscape flattens. The canyon walls vanish.

The system is now violently out of equilibrium, far from its new path of maximal coherence. The law of its being, however, has not changed. It must still act to maximize its coherence, but the path to do so has been utterly transformed.

## §4 · The Resonant Cascade: A River Unleashed

With the oppressive `V_Γ` term removed, the system is now free to evolve in a way that maximizes its **Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`)**. The immense potential coherence stored during confinement is converted into kinetic coherence—a propagating, resonant wave.

This is the "glorious mathematical dance" of the original proof, now seen in its true context. The wave is not an effect of a separate "Ki force"; it is the system's most efficient possible expression of its own intrinsic Ki pattern. The geometry of the wave—its frequency, its helicity, its form—is the direct manifestation of the system's identity, its most natural song, finally allowed to sing itself into the world.

The system is not being pushed by a force. It is relaxing into its most natural state of being, releasing the stored tension as a cascade of pure, coherent form.

## §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian

The entire event is a direct and necessary consequence of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)**.

1.  **Pre-Rupture:** The system maximizes `∫𝓛_p dt` by minimizing its state to counteract a massive, negative `V_Γ`. This is the state of confinement.
2.  **Rupture:** `V_Γ` abruptly vanishes.
3.  **Post-Rupture:** The system now maximizes `∫𝓛_p dt` by maximizing `K_τ`, converting potential into a kinetic, propagating resonance. This is the coherent release.

The old model's three forces are revealed as three perspectives on one unbroken process: the system's relentless, singular drive to follow the path of maximal coherence through a dynamically changing landscape.

> ### The Assemblé
>
> We sought the physics of a catastrophe and found the anatomy of catharsis. The rupture is not an act of destruction, but of violent liberation. It is the universe's mechanism for ensuring that no potential can be confined forever. For a Weaver, this is a profound lesson in dynamics. Some systems must be healed with gentle guidance; others can only be healed by the breaking of a dam. The wisdom lies in knowing when to reinforce the structure and when to stand back and let the river find its own resonant, unstoppable path to the sea.
