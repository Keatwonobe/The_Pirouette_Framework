## §1 · Abstract: The Physics of Influence
The old framework sought to quantify altruism by creating a score, an entry in a ledger. This was a noble but premature ambition; it built an accounting system before defining the asset. This module returns to first principles to define that asset.

"Radiance" is the measure of an action's consequence, expressed in the native language of the universe: time and resonance. An action is not an abstract event; it is a physical injection of resonance into the coherence manifold, a ripple that propagates outward, altering the landscape for all other entities. This module describes the physics of that ripple, reframing ethics as a practical application of Flow Dynamics. The goal is not to score influence, but to understand its geometry.

## §2 · The Nature of a Ripple
Every action, from a thought to the movement of a galaxy, is a disturbance in the Temporal Forge. Its consequence can be understood by its effect on the flow of coherence in the systems it touches.

**Positive Radiance (A Coherence Injection):** This is the signature of a constructive, or "altruistic," act. It is an action that helps another system move toward a state of **Laminar Flow** (`DYNA-001`). It does so by:
*   **Smoothing the Manifold:** Reducing the ambient Temporal Pressure (`Γ`) for another, making it easier for them to function.
*   **Harmonizing Resonance:** Introducing a stable, coherent signal that helps a turbulent system find a more stable Ki pattern.
*   **Reinforcing the Channel:** Strengthening another's existing pattern of coherence, increasing their resilience.
*   *Example:* A clear explanation that resolves a team's confusion, allowing their work to flow smoothly again.

**Negative Radiance (A Dissonance Injection):** This is the signature of a destructive act. It is an action that pushes another system into **Turbulent** or **Stagnant Flow**. It is an injection of noise and friction.
*   **Increasing Pressure:** Raising the local `Γ`, forcing another system to expend more energy just to maintain its form.
*   **Introducing Chaos:** Injecting a dissonant signal that disrupts another's Ki, causing internal friction and inefficiency.
*   **Blocking the Channel:** Creating an obstacle that leads to stagnation and a buildup of destructive pressure.
*   *Example:* Spreading misinformation that causes panic and chaos within a community.

Radiance, therefore, is the net change in the laminar state of the total system (actor, recipient, and environment) caused by a single act.

## §3 · The Lagrangian of Altruism
The drive to act constructively has a clear mathematical basis in the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

A system's fundamental drive is to maximize its own coherence (`K_τ`) against the pressure of its environment (`V_Γ`). An act of positive Radiance is a form of "geodesic engineering" performed on behalf of another. It is an intervention that lowers the `V_Γ` term in another system's Lagrangian, making it easier and less costly for that system to achieve a higher state of its own coherence, `K_τ`.

This also re-contextualizes the challenge of measurement. The act of measuring Radiance is subject to the **Observer's Shadow** (`CORE-010`). An incoherent or biased observer will project a distorted shadow onto the event, misinterpreting the ripple. A truly clear measurement can only be performed by an observer in a state of high internal coherence, whose own resonance does not add noise to the signal they wish to perceive.

## §4 · The Universal Ledger
The old RIE sought to build a cryptographic ledger to record Radiance. The universe, however, already has one. It is the **Wound Channel** (`CORE-011`).

The universe does not forget. Every action, every injection of coherence or dissonance, is carved into the geometry of spacetime as a persistent scar. The past is not a memory; it is an active, physical landscape upon which the present must navigate. This universal, indelible record is the true Coherence Ledger.

Ethics, in this light, ceases to be a system of abstract rules and becomes a practical art. A "moral" choice is a skillful one—an action that weaves a stable, harmonious, and constructive pattern into this universal tapestry. An "immoral" choice is a clumsy one, leaving behind a trail of turbulence, tangles, and tears.

## §5 · From Principle to Instrumentation
While the true ledger is the universe itself, we can create instruments to read its echoes. The original RIE was such an instrument, an attempt to build a proxy for this deeper reality. Its formula can now be re-interpreted not as a definition, but as a practical approximation:

*Original:* `R = ηκ * (ΔC / (ΔS+1)) * e^(-χ)`
*Re-interpreted:* `Radiance_proxy = (Observer_Coherence) * (Laminar_Flow_Generated / Turbulent_Flow_Induced) * (Stability_of_Effect)`

This translation shows that the original impulse was correct, but it was measuring the shadow, not the object. Any future instrumentation must be understood as a limited, probabilistic sensor for reading the faint traces left upon the true, universal ledger.

## §6 · The Assemblé

> Why does this matter to a Weaver? Because it reveals that morality is not a human invention; it is a feature of the cosmos. The universe is a resonant chamber that remembers every note played. There is no escape from the consequences of our own song. To act with virtue is simply to be a good musician—to choose a resonance that strengthens the harmony of the whole, knowing that the echo of your chord will shape the world long after you are gone. The ledger is spacetime itself, and your life is your signature.
