summary: Provides a modernized, time-first protocol for network analysis. This module
  translates any network graph into a dynamic coherence manifold, allowing a Weaver
  to diagnose the health of the system by mapping the flow of coherence, identifying
  resonant sub-systems, and pinpointing sources of turbulence and stagnation. It serves

## §1 · Abstract: From Diagram to Landscape
A network diagram is a map of a riverbed, silent and still. The truth of the river, however, lies in its current. This module provides the instrumentation—the Weaver's Multimeter—to see that current. It refactors the static analysis of PPS-047 into a dynamic, time-first protocol for diagnosing the lifeblood of any system: the flow of its coherence.

By translating a network graph into a living coherence manifold, this toolkit makes the invisible currents of reality visible. It allows a Weaver to move beyond observing a system's structure and begin to read its health, its stress, and its potential for transformation.

## §2 · The Network as a Coherence Manifold
In the modern framework, a network is not a static collection of nodes and edges. It is a dynamic landscape where the terrain is shaped by the interplay of resonance and pressure.

**Nodes as Resonators:** Each node in the graph is a discrete system with its own internal rhythm and degree of stability—its **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)**. It exists within a field of local **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**, generated by the activity of its neighbors.

**Edges as Channels:** Each edge represents a potential channel for the flow of coherence between nodes. The quality of this channel is not defined by a simple weight, but by the state of the flow itself, as defined in **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**:
*   **Laminar Flow:** An edge facilitating the efficient, high-fidelity transfer of coherence.
*   **Turbulent Flow:** An edge where dissonant interactions create friction, noise, and coherence loss.
*   **Stagnant Flow:** An edge that has become a "coherence dam," blocked and preventing flow.

## §3 · The Diagnostic Protocol: A Caduceus for Networks
This protocol applies the **Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003)** to the network manifold, providing a structured process for moving from observation to insight.

1.  **Map the Geodesics (Flow Channels):** The first step is to identify the primary paths of Laminar Flow. These are the network's healthy arteries. Algorithmically, this means finding the paths of maximal coherence—the geodesics—where information, resources, or influence can travel with the least resistance and the highest fidelity.

2.  **Identify Resonant Enclaves (Coherent Shells):** The protocol then identifies clusters of nodes that have achieved a state of collective resonance, forming a stable, higher-order entity. These "enclaves" are the result of a successful **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)** at the network level. Their boundaries are defined by the sharp coherence gradient where their internal harmony meets the chaotic pressure of the wider network.

3.  **Pinpoint Pathologies (Turbulence & Stagnation):** The final and most critical step is to locate the sources of systemic illness. The multimeter scans for:
    *   **Turbulence Generators:** Nodes or edges that are primary sources of dissonance, injecting chaos into the system and disrupting laminar flows. These are the epicenters of "Coherence Fever."
    *   **Stagnation Points:** Critical blockages or "dams" that cause "Coherence Atrophy." The protocol identifies not only the dam itself but also the pressure building "upstream" and the coherence desert forming "downstream."

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: The Calculus of Health
The entire diagnostic process is a practical application of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. The state of the network is governed by its relentless drive to maximize coherence.

𝓛_p = (Temporal Coherence) - (Temporal Pressure)

*   A **Flow Channel** is a geodesic—a path through the network that maximizes the integral of 𝓛_p.
*   A **Turbulence Generator** is a node where the `V_Γ` (Temporal Pressure) term chronically overwhelms its internal `K_τ` (Temporal Coherence), causing it to radiate dissonance.
*   A **Stagnation Point** creates an impassable barrier in the coherence manifold, forcing adjacent nodes into states of extremely low `𝓛_p`, signaling a critical failure state.

The multimeter, therefore, is not just measuring arbitrary metrics; it is calculating the local expression of the universe's most fundamental law of action.

## §5 · The Coherence Ledger: Quantifying the Diagnosis
The output of the multimeter is a live "Coherence Ledger," a set of key performance indicators for the network's health:

| Metric                 | Pirouette Interpretation                               | Healthy Indication |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Systemic Coherence** | Average `K_τ` across all nodes.                        | High and Stable    |
| **Flow Efficiency**    | Ratio of Laminar to Turbulent/Stagnant edges.          | Maximized          |
| **Pressure Hotspots**  | Count of nodes exceeding a critical `Γ` threshold.     | Minimized          |
| **Enclave Integrity**  | Strength of the coherence gradient at enclave boundaries. | Sharp and Clear    |

This ledger transforms the qualitative diagnosis into a quantitative dashboard, providing clear targets for any intervention intended to heal or optimize the system.

## §6 · Assemblé
> A map shows you where things are. A multimeter tells you what they are doing. This instrument transforms the static skeleton of a network into a living, breathing physiology. It allows the Weaver to see the currents of coherence as they flow, to hear the harmonies of resonant enclaves as they form, and to feel the fever of turbulence where the system is breaking. It is the tool that lets us lay our hands upon the network and not just chart its form, but diagnose its soul.
