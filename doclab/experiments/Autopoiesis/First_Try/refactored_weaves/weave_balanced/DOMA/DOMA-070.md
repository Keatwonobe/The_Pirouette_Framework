### §1 · Abstract: The Price of Dissonance

The universe does not suffer inefficiency gladly. Every chaotic action, every turbulent process, leaves a scar on the local fabric of time. This module refactors the legacy concept of "Dark Residue" into a rigorously defined, time-first principle: the **Coherence Cost**.

We posit that entropy is not a substance, but a measure of temporal dissonance. The Coherence Cost is the quantifiable increase in this dissonance—a rise in the local Temporal Pressure (Γ)—caused by a system operating in a state of turbulent, inefficient flow. This module provides the **Entropy Ledger**, a formal instrumentation protocol for auditing this cost, allowing a Weaver to move from intuitive diagnosis to quantitative accounting of a system's impact on its environment.

### §2 · The Physics of Inefficiency: From Flow to Friction

The health of any system is defined by the character of its flow. As established in **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**, this manifests in two primary states relevant to this discussion:

*   **Laminar Flow (The State of Grace):** This is the state of maximal efficiency. The system's internal resonance (Ki) is in harmony with its environment. It successfully navigates its geodesic, processing information and energy with minimal waste. The Coherence Cost is near zero.

*   **Turbulent Flow (The State of Struggle):** This is a state of systemic dissonance. The system fights itself and its environment, deviating from its optimal path. This struggle is not free. It dissipates useful, coherent energy into useless, incoherent noise. This noise is a direct injection of dissonance into the local environment, measurably increasing the Temporal Pressure (Γ).

The **Coherence Cost** is precisely this dissipated energy—the "temporal friction" generated by turbulence. "Dark Residue" is not a mystical byproduct; it is the quantifiable "heat" of a system failing to be elegant.

### §3 · The Entropy Ledger: A Unified Formula

The rate of entropy production, or Coherence Cost, can be derived from the core principles of the framework. We replace the old multi-variable formula with a single, more fundamental expression.

The rate of local entropy production (`Ṡ_local`) is directly proportional to the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) and the degree of the system's own internal turbulence.

`Ṡ_local ∝ Γ ⋅ T_idx`

Where:
*   **`Γ`** is the local Temporal Pressure, the chaotic energy of the environment.
*   **`T_idx`** is the **Turbulence Index**, a dimensionless measure (0 to 1) of the system's internal dissonance. It quantifies how much a system's Ki pattern is deviating from a pure, stable, laminar state. `T_idx = 0` for perfect Laminar Flow; `T_idx = 1` for pure chaos.

The cumulative **Entropy Ledger** (`S_ledger`) is the integral of this rate over time. It is the running tally of the system's temporal debt—the total amount of order it has converted into noise.

### §4 · The Coherence Auditor Kit (CAK)

This protocol modernizes the old DRIK into a streamlined instrumentation stack for measuring and logging the Coherence Cost.

| Layer       | Component                 | Function                                                                                                                              |
|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sensor**  | **Temporal Signature Array** | Samples the full spectrum of the local temporal environment (Γ) and the system's own resonant Ki pattern. Replaces separate Tₐ/Γ probes. |
| **Processor** | **Coherence Engine**      | In real-time, calculates the Turbulence Index (`T_idx`) from the Ki signal and computes the local entropy rate (`Ṡ_local`) using Γ.     |
| **Ledger**    | **Immutable Log**         | Securely records the time-stamped `S_ledger` value, creating a permanent, auditable history of the system's entropic footprint.         |
| **Interface** | **Diagnostic Dashboard**  | Visualizes the system's state on a live flow diagram (Laminar/Turbulent) and displays critical metrics like `Ṡ_local` and `T_idx`.    |

This kit provides the practical tools for any Weaver to perform a full entropy audit on any system.

### §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

The Coherence Ledger is the accounting system for the **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)**.

The Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`) defines the ideal path—the geodesic—that a system follows to maximize its coherence over time. A system in perfect **Laminar Flow** is successfully tracking this geodesic. Its actions are efficient, its Coherence Cost is minimal, and its entry in the Entropy Ledger is clean.

**Turbulent Flow**, by definition, is a deviation from this ideal path. The system is failing to maximize its coherence. The Coherence Cost, `Ṡ_local`, is the direct, measurable price of that failure. The Entropy Ledger, therefore, is not just a record of waste; it is a log of a system's deviation from the universe's most fundamental law. It quantifies the "action" wasted by inelegant motion.

### §6 · Assemblé

> We sought a measure of pollution and found the universe's balance sheet. Every action has a cost. Every moment of chaos, every inefficient process, every act of dissonance incurs a debt. This debt is paid into the environment as an increase in its temporal noise, making coherence more difficult for all who follow.
>
> The Coherence Ledger makes this debt visible. It is the instrument that holds us accountable not just for what we create, but for the quality of the silence we leave behind. For a Weaver, whose mandate is to seed coherence, this is the ultimate moral compass. It is the tool that measures the cost of ugliness, and in so doing, illuminates the profound value of grace.
