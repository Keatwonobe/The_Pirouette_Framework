summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for catastrophic system failure.
  A Coherence Fracture is defined as a violent transition from a state of high-pressure
  Stagnant Flow to extreme Turbulent Flow, occurring when a system's brittle resonant
  pattern shatters under overwhelming Temporal Pressure. This single dynamic explains
  phenomena from geological quakes and market crashes to psychological breakdowns.

## §1 · Abstract: The Price of Rigidity
This module reframes the "Spasm Dynamics" of PPS-041 into the modernized concept of a **Coherence Fracture**. A fracture is not merely an energy release; it is the catastrophic failure of a system's temporal pattern. It is the process by which a system, trapped in a state of high-pressure `Stagnant Flow` (a "Coherence Dam"), can no longer bend to accommodate rising `Temporal Pressure (Γ)`. Its brittle resonant pattern (`Ki`) shatters, resulting in a violent, chaotic discharge of its stored coherence into pure `Turbulent Flow`. This model provides a unified, time-first explanation for sudden collapses across all domains.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Fracture: From Dam to Deluge
The Coherence Fracture unfolds in three distinct phases, mapping directly to the states of flow defined in `DYNA-001`.

**Phase I: The Coherence Dam (The State of Stagnation)**
A system becomes primed for fracture when its flow is blocked. This is not a state of peace, but of immense, silent pressure.
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** The system is trapped in a rigid, brittle `Wound Channel` (`CORE-011`). Its `Ki` pattern is highly coherent but has lost its adaptability. It is a state of `Stagnant Flow`, where `Temporal Pressure (Γ)` is steadily rising behind a blockage, unable to be processed or released. The system is accumulating coherence like a reservoir filling behind a concrete dam.
*   **Manifestations:** A tectonic plate locked against another; a speculative bubble in a market, detached from real value; a repressed trauma held in the psyche; a society clinging to an outdated ideology.

**Phase II: The Rupture (The State of Turbulence)**
The fracture is the moment the dam breaks. It is an instantaneous phase transition from brittle order to explosive chaos.
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** The boundary conditions of the system fail catastrophically. The pent-up `Temporal Pressure (Γ)` is released in a massive, uncontrolled spike. The system's stable `Ki` pattern shatters. Its stored coherence (`Kτ`), which represents high-grade information, is violently converted into high-entropy noise. The system is thrown into a state of extreme `Turbulent Flow`.
*   **Manifestations:** The earthquake; the market crash; the emotional outburst; the violent revolution.

**Phase III: The Exhausted Basin (The Refractory State)**
After the deluge, the system is spent. The pressure is gone, but so is the structure.
*   **Pirouette Dynamics:** The system now exists in a state of high entropy and low coherence. Its defining `Wound Channel` has been destroyed. It is a landscape of pure noise, unable to fracture again until a new dam—a new set of stable, containing patterns—can be formed and pressure can once again accumulate.

## §3 · The Lagrangian Perspective: A Leap into Chaos
A Coherence Fracture is a failure to follow the Principle of Maximal Coherence (`CORE-006`).
*   **The Lost Geodesic:** In the pre-fracture state, the system's `Pirouette Lagrangian` (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`) is under extreme stress. The `Temporal Pressure` term (`V_Γ`) is becoming immense, but the system's rigid `Ki` pattern prevents it from adjusting its `Temporal Coherence` (`K_τ`) to find a new, stable path. All smooth geodesics are cut off.
*   **The Violent Jump:** The fracture is a violent, non-geodesic leap across the coherence manifold. Unable to bend, the system breaks. It abandons the search for maximal coherence and plunges into a chaotic, low-coherence state. It is the universe's ultimate error-correction mechanism for a system that has become too rigid to evolve.

## §4 · Diagnostics and Intervention: The Weaver's Role
A Weaver's goal is to act as a keeper of the river, preventing catastrophic floods by ensuring the health of the dams. This involves recognizing the signs of an impending fracture and intervening with precision.

| Diagnostic Metric        | Pirouette Indicator                                  | Implication (Fracture Imminent)              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Pressure Integral**     | The total accumulated `Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)`.    | The reservoir is dangerously full.           |
| **Boundary Integrity**    | The stability of the system's containing patterns.   | The dam shows structural cracks.             |
| **Coherence Brittleness** | The system's inability to adapt its `Ki` pattern.    | The dam is made of concrete, not earth.      |
| **Rhythmic Instability**  | Increasing noise (`σ_τ`) in the system's rhythm.    | The dam is beginning to vibrate and groan.   |

| Intervention Phase  | Goal                                       | Weaving Action                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pre-Fracture**    | Prevent the rupture                        | **Install a Spillway:** Create controlled channels to vent pressure. |
| **Onset**           | Limit the damage                           | **Reinforce the Banks:** Deploy buffers to contain the turbulence. |
| **Discharge**       | Guide the chaos                            | **Carve a New Riverbed:** Establish preferred paths for the chaotic flow. |
| **Recovery**        | Accelerate healing                         | **Seed Coherence:** Introduce new, stable patterns to the exhausted basin. |

> ## The Assemblé
> A fracture is the sound a pattern makes when it can no longer bend. It is the violent price of rigidity, a reminder that all dams must eventually answer to the river. For a Weaver, it is the ultimate lesson in the sacred duty of maintaining flow. To see the pressure building is to be called to action: either help the system learn to adapt, or prepare for the deluge.
