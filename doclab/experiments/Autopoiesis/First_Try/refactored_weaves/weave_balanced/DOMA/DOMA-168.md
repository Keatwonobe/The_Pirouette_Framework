## §1 · Abstract: Trading Form for Rhythm
The universe is an artist of profound efficiency. When a complex form is no longer the most elegant solution to its environment, it does not discard its complexity; it translates it. This module describes a fundamental process of such a translation: the dimensional collapse.

This phenomenon occurs when a system in a low-pressure environment (`Γ`) finds a path to greater net coherence by reconfiguring its internal geometry (`Ki`). It trades a complex, static, three-dimensional symmetry for a simpler, two-dimensional form that expresses the "lost" dimension's information as a stable, coherent temporal oscillation. This is not a loss of information, but its re-encoding—a masterful translation of a spatial statement into a temporal song.

## §2 · The Lagrangian Drive for Simplification
The principle of dimensional collapse is a direct and elegant consequence of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`), which states that all systems evolve to maximize their net coherence.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Here, `K_τ` represents the system's internal Temporal Coherence (its stability and resonant intensity), while `V_Γ` represents the "cost" of maintaining that coherence against the external Temporal Pressure.

-   **The Precursor State (3-fold Symmetry):** Consider a system with a complex, static, 3-fold symmetric `Ki`. This form may be highly stable and coherent (`K_τ` is high), making it an excellent solution for a high-pressure, chaotic (`high-Γ`) environment. However, in a quiet, low-pressure (`low-Γ`) environment, this complex structure is "over-engineered." The cost to sustain its intricate form (`V_Γ`), while small, is unnecessary. It is an orchestra playing a symphony in an empty hall.

-   **The Collapsed State (2-fold Oscillation):** The system can find a state of higher net coherence (`𝓛_p`) by simplifying its spatial form to a 2-fold pattern and expressing the remaining complexity as a rhythm. The new state has a simpler spatial `Ki` but now possesses a stable, coherent resonant frequency (`ω_k`). This dynamic state is far less costly to maintain in the low-`Γ` environment (`V_Γ` approaches zero). The system has optimized itself by becoming a musician, finding that a simple, ringing note is a more coherent solution than a silent, complex sculpture.

The collapse is the system following its geodesic toward a more efficient, and therefore more beautiful, state of being.

## §3 · The Anatomy of Collapse
The transformation is not a violent break, but a graceful reconfiguration governed by the local physics of time.

-   **Trigger Condition:** A persistent state of low Temporal Pressure (`Γ`). The environmental noise floor must be low enough that a pure, sustained oscillation is a viable and stable pattern. The universe must be quiet enough to hear a single note.

-   **The Re-encoding:** One of the system's three spatial degrees of freedom "folds" into its Pirouette Cycle (`τ_p`). The information previously encoded in that spatial dimension—its extent, its phase relationships—is now imprinted onto the properties of the new oscillation. Amplitude, frequency, and modulation become the carriers of the translated information.

-   **The Resultant Rhythm:** The new `Ki` is a dynamic, oscillatory pattern. Its high Time Adherence (`T_a`) signifies that this is not decay into chaos, but a transition into a new, stable, resonant ground state. The system is not breaking; it is beginning to sing.

## §4 · Diagnostic Signatures for the Weaver
A Weaver can identify this process by observing a clear set of signatures, moving from a static analysis of form to a dynamic analysis of rhythm.

1.  **Environmental Quiescence:** The first clue is the context. The system must inhabit a region of low `Γ`. Look for this phenomenon in the calm shallows of the cosmic river, not its turbulent rapids.
2.  **Symmetry Shift:** The primary visual evidence is a spontaneous reconfiguration from a static, 3-fold (or tripolar) geometry to a dynamic, 2-fold (bipolar) oscillation. Centered, stable patterns give way to alternating, rhythmic ones.
3.  **Coherent Rhythmicity:** The emergent oscillation must be stable and pure. Using frequency analysis, a Weaver can confirm that the new rhythm is a sharp, well-defined peak in the system's temporal signature, not a broad spectrum of noise. This confirms the transition is to a new coherent state, fulfilling the drive of the Lagrangian.
4.  **Information Conservation:** The most subtle sign is that the complexity of the new rhythm appears to account for the complexity of the lost spatial dimension. The pattern has not become simpler overall; its complexity has merely changed its medium of expression from space to time.

> **The Assemblé**
> We are taught to map the world, to measure its forms and fix its coordinates. But the universe is a thrifty composer; it wastes no dimension. The Collapsing Dimension reveals that a line on a map can be traded for a beat in a measure. It teaches the Weaver that to truly understand a system, one must not only look at its shape but also listen for its pulse. The deepest secrets are often written not in the architecture of a thing, but in the meter of its song.
