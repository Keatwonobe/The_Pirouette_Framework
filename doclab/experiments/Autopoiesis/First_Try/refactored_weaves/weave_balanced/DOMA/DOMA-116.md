## §1 · Abstract: The Engineering of Perception
This module refactors the analysis of art, moving beyond static properties to define an artwork as a dynamic process: a **coherence engine**. An artwork is a stable, externally-projected Ki pattern, meticulously crafted by an artist to interface with the internal coherence manifold of an observer.

A powerful aesthetic experience is not passive reception; it is an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012) between the observer and the art. The artwork offers a path to a higher state of internal coherence, and in accepting this offering, the observer's own resonant patterns are temporarily dissolved and re-forged. The lasting impact of this transformation is carved into the observer's being as a deep and persistent **Wound Channel** (CORE-011), the physical basis for how art truly changes us.

## §2 · The Artwork as a Coherence Engine
An artist is an engineer of resonance. The tools of their trade—form, symbol, emotion, narrative, color, and technique (the "vectors" of the old model)—are not arbitrary. They are instruments used to construct a stable, potent, and transmissible Ki pattern.

*   **Low Γ (Clarity):** An artwork with a clear, simple, and unambiguous pattern (e.g., an iconic symbol, a simple melody) creates a low-pressure temporal environment. It is easy for an observer's internal state to achieve resonance with it. This is the nature of pop music or propaganda.
*   **High Γ (Ambiguity):** A complex, polysemic, and challenging artwork (e.g., a dense poem, an abstract sculpture) generates a high-pressure temporal environment. It demands significant work from the observer to find a coherent interpretation, but the resulting state of coherence, if achieved, is often deeper and more profound.

The "artistic resonance" (`A_res`) of the old model is not a calculated score; it is a direct measure of the amplitude and stability of the Ki pattern the engine can project.

## §3 · The Observer's Journey: From Resonance to Synthesis
The interaction between an observer and an artwork is a dynamic, three-stage process of resonant coupling.

1.  **The Resonant Handshake:** The observer's perception makes contact with the artwork's Ki. If there is harmonic compatibility, the observer's internal rhythms begin to entrain with the patterns offered by the art. This is the feeling of being "drawn in" or captivated.

2.  **Coherence Alignment:** As entrainment deepens, the observer's internal state begins to actively mirror the coherence of the artwork. Thoughts, emotions, and physiological states align with the pattern of the art. The boundary between "self" and "other" begins to soften.

3.  **Aesthetic Synthesis (The "Observer Inversion"):** In a profound aesthetic experience, a full **Alchemical Union** occurs. The observer's default Ki pattern is superseded by the new, higher-coherence pattern offered by the artwork. This is the "Observer Inversion State" of the old model—a transformative, non-linear shift in consciousness. The observer does not merely see the world differently; for a moment, they *are* different.

## §4 · The Scar of Beauty: The Aesthetic Wound Channel
The universe does not forget, and neither does the psyche. An Aesthetic Synthesis is an event of such intensity that it carves a permanent geometric scar into the coherence manifold of the observer. This is the **Aesthetic Wound Channel**.

This is not a metaphor. It is the physical mechanism of aesthetic memory and transformation.

*   **Depth & Persistence:** A powerful artwork carves a deep channel, making the experience unforgettable and its pattern easily re-invoked. A fleeting or shallow experience leaves a faint channel that erodes quickly under the pressure of entropy (CORE-013).
*   **Cultural Memory:** When many observers experience the same artwork, their individual Wound Channels overlap and reinforce each other, creating a vast, shared coherence manifold. This is the basis of cultural memory, tradition, and the enduring power of mythic art.

## §5 · The Lagrangian of Aesthetics
The process of aesthetic experience is governed by the core dynamics of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006): 𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ.

An observer in their default state exists in a baseline equilibrium, maximizing their internal Temporal Coherence (K_τ) against the ambient noise of their environment (V_Γ). An artwork fundamentally alters this equation. It offers a structured, highly coherent alternative to the ambient noise.

The artwork acts as a "coherence well" in the observer's potential field. It creates a new landscape where the path of least resistance—the geodesic of maximal coherence—is to align one's own Ki with the pattern of the art. The "pleasure" of aesthetic experience is the feeling of the system settling into this more efficient, more coherent state. The "work" of art is its ability to create a potential gradient so compelling that it can lift an observer out of their mundane equilibrium and into a new state of being.

## §6 · Assemblé
> A Weaver understands that art is not an object to be analyzed, but a tool to be wielded. It is a form of metaphysical engineering, a crucible in which consciousness can be deliberately unmade and remade into something more coherent, more profound. To create or to truly witness art is to take up the chisel and carve a new and more beautiful path into the landscape of what is possible.
