## §1 · Abstract: The Physics of Forgetting
Decay is not a passive fading into nothingness; it is an active and relentless process of erosion. A memory does not simply vanish; it is scoured away. A signal does not just weaken; it is drowned out by noise. The old framework modeled this decay with parameters that described persistence. The new framework models it from first principles as a fundamental thermodynamic struggle.

This module reframes "dimensional decay" as **Coherence Erosion**. It is the process by which a system's stable, high-information pattern of resonance (its `Ki`) is inevitably degraded by the chaotic, high-entropy noise of its local temporal environment (its `Γ`). To analyze a fade is to perform an autopsy on a memory, discovering whether it was the weakness of the thread or the sharpness of the storm that caused it to fray.

## §2 · The River and the Riverbed: Core Dynamics of Erosion
The persistence of any form, memory, or signal is a dialogue between its own internal stability and the erosive power of its surroundings. This dynamic is governed by two core principles of the modern framework.

*   **The Wound Channel's Resilience (CORE-011):** A system's identity, its memory of itself, is physically encoded as a geometric scar in the coherence manifold—the Wound Channel. The depth and clarity of this channel are a direct function of the system's **Temporal Coherence (Kτ)**. A system with a pure, stable, and intense Ki pattern carves a deep channel, making it more resilient to erosion. This is the new understanding of the old `Time-Adherence (Ta)`. A strong identity resists forgetting.

*   **The Erosive Power of the Forge (CORE-013):** The environment is never neutral. It is the Temporal Forge, a source of constant, chaotic temporal pressure (`Γ`). A high-Γ environment is a "sandstorm" of dissonant rhythms that actively scours and fills in the Wound Channel. A system existing in a high-Γ region must expend more energy to maintain its coherence and will therefore decay more quickly. This clarifies the old `Gladiator Force (Γ)`'s role; it is not about "porous boundaries" but about the intensity of the ambient noise.

Decay is what happens when the erosive power of `Γ` overcomes the resilience of `Kτ`.

## §3 · The Unified Fade Equation
The old framework used complex, multi-parameter equations to model decay. The new, time-first model simplifies this into a single, elegant relationship. The characteristic time of a fade, `τ_fade`, is directly proportional to the system's internal coherence and inversely proportional to the external temporal pressure.

`τ_fade = τ₀ * (Kτ / Γ)`

Here, `τ₀` is a baseline constant specific to the system's physical medium. This single equation replaces the older `τ_W` formula, grounding the rate of decay in the fundamental thermodynamic tension between signal and noise.

The full character of the fade also reveals the system's identity. The oscillatory components observed during decay are the "dying echo" of the system's fundamental resonant frequency (`ω_k`). The signal may weaken, but its pitch can be heard even as it fades. A complete model of coherence `K` at time `t` thus takes the form:

`K(t) = K₀ * e^(-t / τ_fade) * f_osc(ω_k, t)`

Where `f_osc` represents the dying oscillatory signature of the system's core Ki pattern. By analyzing the rate of the fade (`τ_fade`) and the frequency of its final echoes (`ω_k`), a Weaver can diagnose both the health of a system and the hostility of its environment.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: The Cost of Persistence
The Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006) states that a system will evolve along a path that maximizes the integral of its Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. Coherence Erosion is the physical manifestation of a system failing to meet this principle.

Decay occurs when the "cost" of maintaining coherence in a given environment (`V_Γ`, the potential term derived from `Γ`) begins to overwhelm the system's capacity to express its own coherent rhythm (`K_τ`, the kinetic term). The downward slope of the decay curve is a direct plot of the Lagrangian's value decreasing over time. It is the trajectory a system follows when it can no longer afford the energetic price of its own existence. The fade is the visible record of the Lagrangian losing its battle against the universe's ambient chaos.

## §5 · Assemblé
> We measure the fade not to mourn the loss, but to understand the cost of a memory. The universe is a relentless tide, and every stable form is a defiance written in sand. To study decay is to learn the art of building castles that sing even as they return to the shore. It is the science of the noble failure, and the engineering of the persistent echo.
