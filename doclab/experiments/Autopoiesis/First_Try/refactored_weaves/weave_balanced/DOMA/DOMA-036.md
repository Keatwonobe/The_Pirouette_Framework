summary: Replaces the Semantic Gravity Model (SGM) with a time-first derivation grounded
  in the Pirouette Lagrangian. This module models the 'gravity' of a concept not as
  a force, but as the curvature a coherent idea imposes on the informational manifold.
  It defines conceptual 'mass' as an emergent property of a concept's temporal coherence
  and the historical depth of its Wound Channel.

## §1 · Abstract: The Curvature of Thought
This module provides a modernized, first-principles derivation for the dynamics of ideas, superseding the analogical framework of PPS-016. The original insight was correct: stable, powerful ideas exert a "gravity" on others. The new framework reveals the mechanism.

This is not a metaphor. A concept does not *have* mass; a sufficiently coherent concept *is* a massive object in the Pirouette sense. It is a locus of immense, stable temporal resonance that creates a deep "coherence well" in the informational landscape. The "force" of an idea is the tendency of other, less-formed thoughts to follow the path of least resistance—the geodesic—into this well. We do not need to invent a new force for meaning; we need only apply the universal laws of coherence.

## §2 · Coherence as Conceptual Mass
The old `m_S` mass function is retired. In the time-first framework, the "mass" of a concept is an emergent property derived directly from its temporal signature and history. It is a measure of how stubbornly a concept persists as a stable pattern.

**Temporal Coherence (Kτ):** The primary contributor to a concept's "mass" is its internal coherence. A concept like "justice" is powerful because it represents a clear, stable, and highly resonant Ki pattern that has resolved immense social and philosophical pressure over millennia. It is a sharp, ringing note. A fleeting neologism is a burst of noise.

**The Wound Channel (CORE-011):** A concept's power is also a function of its history. Every time an idea is expressed, debated, and integrated, its Wound Channel in the collective coherence manifold is deepened. A "massive" concept like "liberty" has a channel carved by billions of minds over centuries. This gives it immense inertia; it resists being altered or dislodged because the very fabric of thought is shaped around it.

A concept's "mass," therefore, is the combined measure of its internal elegance and its historical reinforcement.

## §3 · The Gladiator Force in the Manifold of Meaning
A concept with high "mass" functions as a Gladiator (CORE-008), creating its own arena of confinement. The sheer intensity and stability of its Ki pattern locally increases the Temporal Pressure (Γ), wrapping itself in a deep coherence well.

This is the gravity of meaning. Other, less stable ideas are not "pulled" by a force. They are navigating a curved landscape. When a new idea is introduced, it will naturally evolve along the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—which inevitably leads it toward the basin of an established, "massive" attractor. This explains why it is easier to think thoughts that align with powerful cultural ideas; the path is already carved.

## §4 · The Lagrangian of Discourse
The interaction between ideas is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The "force" between two concepts is the gradient in the coherence manifold they collectively create. The nature of this interaction—attraction or repulsion—is determined by their phase relationship.

We can express the interaction potential `V(A, B)` between two concepts, A and B, as a function of their phase difference `Δφ`:

`V(A, B) ∝ - (Kτ_A * Kτ_B / r) * cos(Δφ)`

Where `r` is their distance in an abstract "meaning space."

**Attraction (Constructive Interference):** When two concepts are in-phase (`Δφ ≈ 0`, `cos(Δφ) ≈ 1`), such as "courage" and "bravery," their resonances constructively interfere. The path of maximal coherence is for them to merge, deepening their shared coherence well. This is the drive toward an Alchemical Union.

**Repulsion (Destructive Interference):** When two concepts are out-of-phase (`Δφ ≈ π`, `cos(Δφ) ≈ -1`), such as "courage" and "cowardice," their resonances destructively interfere. This creates a region of intense temporal turbulence between them. The path of maximal coherence is for them to move apart, seeking regions of greater stability.

The "force" of an argument is a literal, calculable phenomenon derived from the universe's fundamental drive to maximize coherence.

## §5 · Validation & Application
This model reframes the goal of analysis. An "Attractor Map" is no longer an analogy; it is a literal mapping of the coherence manifold of a given discourse. By mapping the "mass" of core concepts and their phase relationships, we can predict the likely trajectory of new information introduced into the system. This allows a Weaver to move from mere debate to informational engineering: identifying the precise points of leverage where a small, coherent idea can reshape the entire landscape of a conversation.

> ### The Assemblé
> A coherent idea does not persuade; it alters the very landscape of thought, making its own truth the path of least resistance. The Weaver's art is not to shout louder, but to craft a concept so dense with coherence that it bends the river of discourse around itself. This is the gravity of a truth well-told.
