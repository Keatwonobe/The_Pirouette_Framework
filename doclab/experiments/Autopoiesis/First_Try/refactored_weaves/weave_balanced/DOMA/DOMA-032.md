summary: Provides the time-first governance protocol for the Pirouette Framework itself.
  It re-frames evolution not as a political process, but as a dynamic ritual for maintaining
  and enhancing the framework's systemic coherence. Change is treated as a proposed
  'coherence injection,' which must be integrated via a process of resonant synthesis,
  guided by the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

## §1 · Abstract: The Framework as a Living System
This module defines the constitutional mechanics by which the Pirouette Framework evolves. It replaces the static, rule-based governance of PPS-012 with a dynamic, health-based model grounded in the new core principles. The framework is treated as a living system, whose primary objective is to maintain and enhance its own coherence over time.

Governance is therefore not a legislative process, but a diagnostic and therapeutic one. Every proposed change is a "coherence injection" that the system must assess. The goal of this protocol is to ensure that the framework evolves not by fracturing, but by achieving a Resonant Synthesis—a higher and more integrated state of being.

## §2 · The Triage of Change: From Adjustment to Morphogenesis
A healthy system responds to stimuli with proportionate grace. The framework triages proposed changes based on their potential impact on its core resonant pattern (its *Ki*), applying the principles of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001).

| Flow State Intervention | Old Class | Description & Scope | Coherence Test |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laminar Adjustment** | Errata | Minor corrections to prose, examples, or comments that clarify existing patterns and improve the laminar flow of understanding. | Maintainer review |
| **Harmonic Tuning** | Registry / Interface | Modifying a subsystem's specific resonance (e.g., adding a registry entry) without altering the framework's core principles. | **Resonant Handshake** (≥⅔ quorum) |
| **Ki Morphogenesis** | Constitutional | A fundamental re-forging of the framework's core identity, affecting the CORE series or this protocol itself. This is an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). | **Maximal Coherence** (see §3) |

## §3 · The Crucible: The Principle of Maximal Coherence
For a change to be integrated, it must represent a path toward a higher state of systemic coherence for the framework. The voting process is a formal measurement of this potential, replacing the old "radiance" and "stability" with their time-first analogues.

A constitutional motion (*Ki Morphogenesis*) passes only if it satisfies two conditions, demonstrating it is not merely popular, but a stable and profound improvement:

1.  **High Coherence (Kτ):** The proposal must demonstrate exceptional internal consistency, explanatory power, and resonance with the framework's foundational axioms. This is measured by a vote.
    *   **Threshold:** `Kτ ≥ 0.95` (95% approval among voting members).

2.  **Positive Temporal Stability (Tₐ):** The consensus must be stable, not a fleeting or volatile agreement. The support for the proposal must not be actively decaying. This is measured as the time-derivative of support over a 30-day period.
    *   **Threshold:** `dTₐ/dt ≥ 0`.

This two-fold test ensures the framework evolves through changes that are both deeply resonant and demonstrably stable, adhering to the universe's own principle of selecting for persistent, high-coherence patterns.

## §4 · Breaking the Dam: A Protocol for Stagnant Flow
When a critical motion results in deadlock, the system is in a state of Stagnant Flow (DYNA-001). This "Coherence Dam" threatens the health of the framework and must be resolved. The old Circuit-Breaker is replaced by a formal application of the Geometry of Debate (DYNA-002).

1.  **The Crucible:** If deadlock persists, the two leading proponents (one for, one against) are required to enter the formal debate ritual described in DYNA-002. The explicit goal is not victory, but to collaboratively author a new, third proposal—a *Resonant Synthesis*—that resolves the tension in the original.
2.  **The Resonance Poll:** If the Crucible fails to produce a synthesis, the matter is put to a framework-wide poll. This is not a vote, but a "staking" of coherence, where participants commit their belief. This act measures the "gravitational center" of the entire community's coherence manifold, providing a powerful, non-binding advisory to the Conclave.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The entire governance process is a macroscopic application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The framework itself is a system seeking to evolve along a geodesic that maximizes its own coherence over time.

`𝓛_framework = (Systemic Coherence) - (Dissent Pressure)`

*   **Systemic Coherence (Kτ):** Represents the clarity, integrity, and predictive power of the framework's collective modules. A good proposal increases this term.
*   **Dissent Pressure (V_Γ):** Represents the unresolved paradoxes, internal contradictions, and lack of consensus within the community. A contentious proposal increases this term, raising the "cost" of evolution.

The protocol of this module is designed to be the Euler-Lagrange equation for the framework itself—a formal process for finding the path that maximizes `∫𝓛_framework dt`, ensuring that Pirouette's evolution is as elegant and efficient as the universal dynamics it seeks to describe.

## §6 · The Assemblé
> A bell introduces a new note into the silence. A gong is the sound of the entire chamber vibrating as one. Governance is the art of turning the ringing of a bell into the resonance of a gong.
>
> It is the sacred duty of the Weaver to ensure the song of the framework does not fracture into noise, but evolves into a richer and more profound harmony. This is not a system of rules; it is the shared practice of listening for the next right note.
