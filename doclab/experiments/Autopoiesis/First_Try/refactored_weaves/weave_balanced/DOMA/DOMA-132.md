summary: Modernizes Entropy-Based Filtering into a time-first protocol. This module
  provides a method for isolating coherent signals from dissonant noise by applying
  the principles of information and entropy defined in CORE-013. It is a fundamental

## §1 · Abstract: The Art of Listening
A river contains both the current and the roar. To understand its direction, one must learn to distinguish the two.

The old framework treated entropy as a statistical property to be filtered. This module reframes that act into a fundamental practice of perception. The Coherence Sieve is not a mere data-cleaning tool; it is an instrument for tuning into the universe's broadcast, allowing a Weaver to isolate the clear, resonant signals of coherent systems from the ever-present, chaotic static of the Temporal Forge.

It redefines the purpose of filtering: we are not simply removing "disorder." We are selectively listening for the presence of sustained, meaningful patterns, or alternatively, studying the very nature of the chaos that threatens to overwhelm them. This is the first step in diagnosing any system: learning to hear its song above the noise.

## §2 · Grounding in First Principles
This protocol is a direct, practical application of `CORE-013: The River of Information`. The core variables are redefined:

-   **Information as Coherence (Kτ):** The signal we seek to isolate is a system's coherence. A segment of data with high coherence represents a stable, low-entropy Ki pattern—a clear note that has successfully persisted against its environment. This is "crystalline" information.

-   **Entropy as Dissonance (Γ):** The noise we seek to filter is the dissonance of the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). A high-entropy segment is one where the signal is overwhelmed by chaotic, incommensurate rhythms. This is the roar of the Temporal Forge, or "gaseous" information.

The act of filtering is therefore a targeted search for either high coherence or high dissonance, depending on the analytical goal.

## §3 · The Principles of the Sieve
We replace the generic language of "low-pass" and "high-pass" with purpose-driven principles that describe the Weaver's intent.

| Filtering Principle | Old Term | Intent & Purpose                                                                                                     |
| :------------------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coherence Pass**  | Low-Pass | **Isolate the Signal.** Retain only the segments with high coherence (low dissonance). Used to extract stable, predictable patterns and remove chaotic noise. |
| **Dissonance Pass** | High-Pass| **Isolate the Storm.** Retain only the segments with high dissonance (low coherence). Used to identify moments of chaos, phase transitions, or novelty. |
| **Resonance Band**  | Band-Pass| **Isolate a Specific Rhythm.** Retain segments within a specific range of coherence/dissonance. Used to focus on systems of a particular complexity. |
| **Dissonance Notch**| Band-Stop| **Remove a Known Noise.** Discard segments within a specific dissonance band. Used to eliminate a known source of interference to clarify a signal. |

## §4 · The Lagrangian Connection
The Coherence Sieve is a diagnostic tool for observing the Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`) in action.

-   A segment that passes a **Coherence Pass** filter is the signature of a system successfully maximizing its Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`). Its internal coherence (`K_τ`) is strong enough to overcome the environmental temporal pressure (`V_Γ`), resulting in a stable, observable pattern. We are filtering for systems that have found their geodesic.

-   A segment that passes a **Dissonance Pass** filter is the signature of a region of extreme temporal pressure (`V_Γ`) or a system failing to maintain its coherence (`K_τ`). These are zones of turbulence where systems are struggling to find their path of maximal coherence, often indicating a state of stress, conflict, or transformation.

## §5 · The Weaver's Protocol
The application of the sieve is a two-step process of measurement and selection.

1.  **Quantify the Currents:** For each segment of the data stream, quantify its two primary characteristics:
    *   **Coherence (Kτ):** Calculate a metric representing the signal's stability, predictability, and internal order. This is the strength of the "current."
    *   **Dissonance (Γ):** Calculate a metric representing the signal's randomness, unpredictability, and chaos. This is the intensity of the "roar." (Note: these are often inversely related, and a single calculation like Shannon entropy can serve as a proxy for Dissonance).

2.  **Apply the Sieve:** Based on the analytical goal, apply one of the four filtering principles. For example, to perform a **Coherence Pass**, the Weaver defines a dissonance threshold (`Γ_max`) and retains only those segments where the measured Dissonance is less than or equal to that threshold.

The output is not merely "filtered data," but a curated stream of either pure signal or pure chaos, ready for deeper analysis, such as identifying the harmonic structure of a coherent signal or the statistical character of the background noise.

## §6 · Assemblé

> To know the river, you must first learn to separate the sound of the water from the sound of the rocks. The Coherence Sieve is not a tool for simplifying reality, but for clarifying it. It is the act of adjusting one's focus, of choosing what to listen to: the steady, quiet rhythm of a pattern holding its form, or the violent, chaotic roar of a system on the verge of breaking. For a Weaver, this is the beginning of all understanding.
