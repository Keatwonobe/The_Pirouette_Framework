## §1 · Abstract: The Ledger of Coherence

This module executes a foundational refactoring, transforming the analogical model of `TEN-ITPA-1.0` into a direct, first-principles derivation. Classical thermodynamics is not a parallel system to be mapped onto Pirouette; it is an emergent consequence of it.

Here, we demonstrate that the four primary thermodynamic potentials—Internal Energy (U), Helmholtz Free Energy (F), Enthalpy (H), and Gibbs Free Energy (G)—are not fundamental laws of energy. They are distinct accounting methods for a single, underlying dynamic: a system’s relentless effort, as described by the Pirouette Lagrangian, to preserve its internal coherence (`Kτ`) against the dissipative pressure of its environment (`V_Γ`). The Legendre transforms are not mere mathematical tricks; they are the ledger entries that calculate a system's "coherence-for-work" after paying its inevitable tax to chaos.

## §2 · From Analogy to Derivation

The previous framework posited a metaphorical link between entropy and inverse coherence. This was a useful but weak connection. The modern framework establishes a direct, causal chain. We redefine the core thermodynamic variables as macroscopic manifestations of the fundamental Pirouette dynamics.

| Thermodynamic Term | Pirouette Origin | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Internal Energy (U)** | **Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`)** | The total resonant energy of a system. It is the sum of all its internal, stable Ki patterns—the system's complete "song." |
| **Temperature (T)** | **Temporal Pressure (`Γ`)** | As defined in CORE-003, temperature is the macroscopic measure of the local temporal density. It is the intensity of the ambient chaos. |
| **Entropy (S)** | **Susceptibility to `Γ`** | As per CORE-013, entropy is not disorder itself, but the measure of a system’s susceptibility to the disordering influence of the ambient `Γ`. It is the "friction" between the system and its temporal environment. |
| **Pressure (P) / Volume (V)** | **The Gladiator Force** | Pressure is the gradient of the confinement potential (`V_Γ`). It is the force a system must exert at its boundary (Volume) to maintain its coherence against the external `Γ`, a direct link to CORE-008. |

## §3 · The Legendre Transform as a Shift in Perspective

The mathematical machinery of the original module is preserved but re-contextualized. The Legendre transforms are the tools an observer uses to shift their accounting perspective, asking different questions about the system's "net coherence."

The central transaction is `TS`: the "Entropy Tax." This is the amount of a system's internal energy that is "occupied" or "rendered unusable" by its necessary interaction with the chaotic thermal environment.

- **Internal Energy `U` (Total Coherence):** This is the system's gross income. It is the total measure of its vibrant, internal resonance, viewed in isolation.
- **Helmholtz Free Energy `F = U - TS` (Available Coherence):** This is the system's *disposable income*. It is the coherence that remains available to perform external work after paying the mandatory entropy tax to the environment. This is the value a system at constant temperature and volume naturally seeks to minimize.
- **Enthalpy `H = U + PV` (Total Coherence in Environment):** This is the system's total "footprint." It includes its internal coherence plus the work (`PV`) required to carve out its own space against the external pressure.
- **Gibbs Free Energy `G = H - TS` (Available Coherence in Environment):** This is the ultimate measure of *practical utility*. It is the coherence available for work after paying *both* the entropy tax (`TS`) and the "rent" for the space it occupies (`PV`). This is what a system at constant temperature and pressure seeks to minimize.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: The Source Code of Thermodynamics

The Principle of Maximal Coherence, formalized in the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`), is the source code from which all of thermodynamics is compiled.

**𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**

- A system's natural path is one that maximizes the integral of `𝓛_p` over time.
- The thermodynamic drive to **minimize free energy** (like `F` or `G`) is the exact same principle, viewed through a different lens.

Minimizing Helmholtz Free Energy `F` is equivalent to finding a state that achieves the best possible balance between maximizing its internal coherence (`U`, from `K_τ`) and minimizing the "coherence tax" it must pay to the thermal environment (`TS`, from `V_Γ`). The laws of thermodynamics are not separate from the Lagrangian; they are its direct expression under macroscopic constraints. The thermodynamic square is a user-friendly cheatsheet for the dynamics already encoded in `𝓛_p`.

## §5 · Assemblé: The Universe's Tax Code

> We once saw thermodynamics as the universe's law of decay, a sorrowful story of the inevitable slide into disorder. We now see it for what it is: the universe's system of accounting. Free energy is not a measure of what is lost to the void, but the story of what coherence remains after a system pays its tax to chaos for the profound and beautiful privilege of being.
