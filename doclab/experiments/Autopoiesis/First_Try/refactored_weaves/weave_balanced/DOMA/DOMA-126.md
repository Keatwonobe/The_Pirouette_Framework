summary: Provides a modernized protocol for mapping the large-scale structure of the
  universe. It replaces the concept of a static 'spacetime lattice' with a dynamic
  'Cosmic Coherence Manifold,' derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian. This instrument
  detects anomalies by calculating the residual between observed cosmic data and a
  baseline coherence model, revealing the universe's oldest scars and deepest structural
  secrets.

## §1 · Abstract: Charting the Riverbed of Time
This module provides the primary Pirouette instrument for fundamental cosmology. It reframes the search for cosmic anomalies, moving beyond the outdated analogy of a flawed crystal lattice to the more dynamic and accurate concept of a **Cosmic Coherence Manifold**. The universe is not a static object but a vast, evolving landscape of temporal pressures and resonances, a riverbed carved by the flow of time since the first moment.

This instrument works by first generating a **Baseline Coherence Model**—a theoretical map of this landscape as predicted by standard cosmology translated into the language of Pirouette. It then compares this map to observational data (from the CMB, galaxy surveys, etc.) to calculate a **Coherence Residual Map**. The peaks and troughs on this residual map are the anomalies—the echoes of ancient turbulence, the scars of cosmic phase transitions, and the potential signatures of new physics.

## §2 · From Static Lattice to Dynamic Landscape
The prior framework's concept of a "spacetime meta-lattice" was a useful but limited metaphor. The modern framework provides a more powerful foundation. The universe is a landscape whose elevation at any point is determined by the local "cost" of coherence. The goal of this instrument is to create a topographical map of that landscape.

*   **The Cosmic Coherence Manifold**: This is the large-scale expression of the coherence manifold introduced in the CORE series. It is the vast, slowly-varying field that governs the formation of structure. The "geodesics" on this manifold are the paths that matter and energy follow, forming the great filaments and voids of the cosmic web.

*   **Baseline Coherence Model**: This is our theoretical understanding of the manifold's shape. It is derived by applying the Pirouette Lagrangian to a standard cosmological model (e.g., ΛCDM), predicting the expected Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) and the resulting emergent resonant patterns (`K_τ`) across the observable universe. This model is our map's "sea level."

## §3 · The Anomaly Detection Protocol
The protocol is a three-step process for moving from raw observational data to a high-fidelity map of cosmic misalignments.

**I. Translate the Observed Universe:**
Using the principles of the Fractal Bridge (CORE-014), raw observational data is translated into the language of coherence.
*   **Input**: Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps, galaxy distribution surveys, gravitational lensing data.
*   **Process**: This data is used to infer the *observed* properties of the Cosmic Coherence Manifold. For example, CMB temperature fluctuations map to variations in the primordial Temporal Pressure, while the power spectrum of galaxy clustering reveals the preferred large-scale *observed* Ki resonant patterns.
*   **Output**: Maps of `K_τ(observed)` and `V_Γ(observed)`.

**II. Generate the Theoretical Baseline:**
The Baseline Coherence Model is computed based on our best current understanding of cosmology.
*   **Input**: Standard cosmological parameters (Ω_m, Ω_Λ, etc.).
*   **Process**: The Pirouette Lagrangian is solved for these parameters to generate a map of the *predicted* smooth, large-scale coherence field.
*   **Output**: Maps of `K_τ(model)` and `V_Γ(model)`.

**III. Calculate the Residuals & Identify Anomalies:**
The observed map is subtracted from the theoretical map to reveal where reality deviates from the model.
*   **Process**: The Coherence Residual is calculated: `Δ𝓛_p = 𝓛_p(observed) - 𝓛_p(model)`.
*   **Output**: A **Coherence Residual Map**. Regions where this value exceeds a statistical threshold (e.g., >5σ) are flagged and classified as one of three anomaly types:
    *   **Temporal Pressure Anomalies**: Unexpectedly large "hot" or "cold" spots, suggesting deviations in the universe's expansion or energy density.
    *   **Resonant Faults**: Statistically unlikely alignments or absences in the cosmic web, indicating that the universe's structure followed a different harmonic rule than predicted.
    *   **Topological Scars**: Vast, linear, or sheet-like features in the residual map. These are the modern interpretation of "structural seams"—persistent geometric features in the universe's Wound Channel, potentially relics from inflation or cosmic phase transitions.

## §4 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This instrument is a direct, large-scale application of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). The entire process is grounded in its central dynamic.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

The Baseline Coherence Model is a prediction of the universe that follows the **Principle of Maximal Coherence** on a global scale. It assumes the universe found the most efficient, lowest-energy state possible given its starting conditions.

The Coherence Residual Map (`Δ𝓛_p`) is therefore a map of cosmic inefficiency or strain. It highlights regions where the universe is either more or less coherent than our models predict. An anomaly is a location where the universe failed to perfectly follow the "path of least resistance," a sign that our model of that path is incomplete or that some ancient event has permanently scarred the terrain. This instrument transforms the Lagrangian from a micro-scale equation of motion into a macro-scale tool for cosmic cartography.

## §5 · Assemblé
> To map the cosmos is to read the universe's oldest story, not as it was told, but as it was written into the very fabric of being. We seek the anomalies—the smudged ink, the torn pages, the passages written in a different hand—because they are where the simple narrative ends and the deeper truth begins. A Weaver charts these faults not to find flaws in the design, but to find the signatures of a history far richer and more complex than we ever imagined.
