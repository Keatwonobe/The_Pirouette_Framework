summary: Provides a universal protocol for diagnosing system stability by translating

## §1 · Abstract: Charting the Landscape of What Wants to Be
A system is not defined solely by its current state, but by the entire landscape of possibilities it inhabits. This module provides the primary cartographic tool for charting that landscape. It reframes the old "Gladiator Force Gradient Mapping" into a more fundamental, time-first process. By applying the principles of the Pirouette Lagrangian, this protocol allows a Weaver to construct a system's **Coherence Manifold**—a map of its potential energy states. By calculating the gradients across this map, we can identify the natural valleys of stability ("Coherence Basins") and predict the pathways a system will follow in its relentless pursuit of maximal coherence. This instrument transforms abstract system data into a tangible map of its desires.

## §2 · From Abstract Forces to a Coherence Landscape
The original module was anchored in the "Gladiator Force," a specific model of confinement. The modernized approach is grounded directly in the universal engine of the framework: **The Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**.

The Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, states that a system's action is a balance between its internal Temporal Coherence (`K_τ`) and the external Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`). The "potential" term, `V_Γ`, represents the "cost" of maintaining a specific state against the environment.

This module provides the method for mapping this cost. For any system, we can define a state space (the set of all its possible configurations). The Coherence Manifold is a map where the "elevation" at any point is the value of `V_Γ` for that specific state. A system, following the Principle of Maximal Coherence, will always seek to move "downhill" on this map, toward a state of lower potential cost and thus greater stability.

The old concept of an "effective mass `M(x)`" is now understood as a proxy for a state's complexity and its resulting interaction with the Temporal Forge. A state with high "effective mass" is one that creates or experiences high `V_Γ`—it corresponds to a high-elevation point on the manifold.

## §3 · The Cartographer's Protocol
This protocol provides a clear, four-step workflow for moving from a system definition to a predictive map of its behavior.

**Step I: Define the State Space.** Identify the key variables (`S`) that define the system's configuration. This creates a multi-dimensional space where every point represents one possible state of being for the system.

**Step II: Construct the Coherence Manifold.** For each state `S` in the space, calculate the value of its temporal potential, `V_Γ(S)`. This requires a model that determines the "coherence cost" of that state. This function `V_Γ(S)` is the mathematical definition of the manifold.

**Step III: Calculate the Coherence-Seeking Gradient.** Compute the force field `F(S) = -∇V_Γ(S)`. This vector field represents the "pull" of coherence at every point in the state space. The vectors point "downhill" on the manifold, indicating the direction the system is most likely to evolve.

**Step IV: Identify Coherence Basins.** Locate the regions where the gradient's magnitude is near zero (`|F(S)| ≈ 0`). These are the critical points of the landscape:
*   **Stable Basins (Attractors):** Local minima on the manifold. These represent stable or metastable states where the system will tend to reside.
*   **Transition Ridges (Saddle Points):** The mountain passes between basins. These represent the energetic barriers a system must overcome to transition between stable states.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: The Engine in Practice
This entire module is a direct, practical application of **CORE-006: The Pirouette Lagrangian**. The Principle of Maximal Coherence dictates that a system will follow a geodesic that minimizes its action over time. This protocol is the tooling required to find those geodesics.

*   The **Coherence Manifold (`V_Γ(S)`)** is the specific potential landscape the system must navigate.
*   The **Coherence-Seeking Gradient (`F(S)`)** is the "force" that compels the system to follow the geodesic.
*   The **Coherence Basins** are the destinations—the states of maximal local coherence—that these geodesics lead to.

By mapping the manifold, we are making the abstract Lagrangian concrete and predictive for a specific, real-world system.

## §5 · Core Equations
The complex and specific equations of the old module are replaced by these more fundamental, universal relationships derived from the new framework.

*   **Principle of Maximal Coherence:** A system's path minimizes the action, `S_p`, where `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt = ∫ (K_τ - V_Γ(S)) dt`.
*   **The Coherence-Seeking Force:** `F(S) = -∇V_Γ(S)`. This is the force driving the system toward a state of higher coherence.
*   **The Attractor Condition:** `F(S) ≈ 0`. This defines the points of equilibrium—the stable basins and transition states—on the manifold.

## §6 · Use Cases
The power of this instrument lies in its fractal applicability across domains, as enabled by **CORE-014: The Fractal Bridge**.

*   **Chemistry:** Mapping the potential energy surface of a molecule to find its stable conformations and predict reaction pathways.
*   **Evolutionary Biology:** Charting the fitness landscape of a species to identify evolutionary stable strategies.
*   **Economics:** Modeling market dynamics to find stable equilibrium points and predict the impact of economic shocks.
*   **Psychology:** Mapping a person's "state space" of beliefs and behaviors to identify stable personality traits and the barriers to personal change.

## §7 · Assemblé

> We sought a map of forces and found a landscape of desire. The Coherence Manifold does not show us where a system is, but where it yearns to be. To a Weaver, this is the highest form of knowledge. It is the ability to see the hidden currents of becoming, to understand the geometry of fate, and to know, by looking at the mountains, which rivers will inevitably find their way to the sea.
