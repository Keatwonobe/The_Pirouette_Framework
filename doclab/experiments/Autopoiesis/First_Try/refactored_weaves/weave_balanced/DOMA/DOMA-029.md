## §1 · Abstract: Carving the Riverbed
A framework is not a static text; it is a living system, a river of thought that deepens and clarifies its own channel over time. For this river to flow with purpose, its banks—its history, its foundational constants, its very identity—must be stable and true. An unverified change is not an evolution; it is a breach, a source of turbulence that erodes the entire structure.

This module defines the **Ritual of Provenance**, the technical and philosophical protocol that governs the evolution of the Pirouette Framework. It is the loom upon which the tapestry of our collective work is woven, ensuring every new thread strengthens the whole. It reframes a standard software development practice (CI/CD) as a sacred act of maintaining coherence.

## §2 · The Wound Channel of the Canon
As established in CORE-011, every entity carves a **Wound Channel** in spacetime—a geometric record of its history. The Pirouette Framework, as a coherent system of thought, is no different. Its Wound Channel is the cumulative history of its development, recorded in its version control system.

The framework's core parameters—its fundamental constants and defined relationships—form the **Canon**. This Canon is the framework's DNA. The Ritual of Provenance is the epigenetic process that ensures this DNA mutates with intention and perfect fidelity, deepening the Wound Channel without introducing corruption.

## §3 · The Seal of Coherence
To attest to the integrity of the Canon at any point in time, we employ a cryptographic hash (SHA256). In the old language, this was a `registry_hash`. In the new, it is the **Seal of Coherence**.

The Seal is not merely a checksum. It is the **Canonical Echo** of the framework's state—a unique, reproducible signature derived from the precise configuration of the Canon. If a single constant is altered, the echo changes completely. This Seal is the physical proof that a given version of the framework is internally consistent and true to its documented form.

`Seal of Coherence = SHA256(The Canon of Constants)`

## §4 · The Ritual of Provenance: A Twofold Path
The ritual is enforced through a simple but unyielding automated workflow, ensuring that every contribution is a conscious and coherent act.

### I. The Weaver's Vow (The Pre-commit Hook)
Before a Weaver can contribute their thread to the loom, they must make a local vow of integrity. A pre-commit script automatically calculates the Seal of Coherence from their proposed changes. If it does not match the documented Seal, the contribution is halted. This prevents accidental dissonance from ever entering the shared channel.

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
echo "▶ Pirouette Canon: Verifying Seal of Coherence..."
python scripts/verify_seal.py || {
  echo "✖ Coherence Fault: Canon has changed. Run 'python scripts/verify_seal.py --attest' to update the Seal."
  exit 1
}
```

### II. The Loom's Test (The CI Pipeline)
When a Weaver's changes are proposed to the collective, the central loom performs its own, independent verification. The continuous integration (CI) pipeline rebuilds the entire framework from source and recalculates the Seal. If this newly forged Seal does not match the one attested to in the Weaver's contribution, the build fails. This is a **Coherence Fault**, the system's immune response to a change that is not in harmony with the whole.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pirouette-build.yml
# ...
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: python compiler.py --build-canon
      - name: The Loom's Test - Verify Seal of Coherence
        run: python scripts/verify_seal.py
```

## §5 · Connection to the Lagrangian
This protocol is the practical governor of the framework's own **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006). The framework itself is a system striving to maximize its own internal coherence (Kτ) against the external pressure (Γ) of new ideas, critiques, and data.

The Canon of Constants defines the very terms of this Lagrangian. An undocumented or dissonant change to the Canon is a direct injection of turbulence, knocking the system off its geodesic of maximal coherence.

The Ritual of Provenance acts as a stabilizing force. It ensures that the evolution of the framework's Lagrangian is itself a **laminar flow**. It prevents chaotic, turbulent changes and forces every modification to be a deliberate, attested-to step along a path of increasing clarity and integrity. The Seal of Coherence is the mathematical proof that the system remains on its path.

## §6 · Assemblé
> To speak a truth is simple. To carve it into the memory of the world, ensuring it will echo without distortion through time—that is the Weaver's art. This ritual is not a constraint; it is the chisel. It is the sacred act of turning a fleeting insight into a lasting landmark, a promise that the story we write together will endure.
