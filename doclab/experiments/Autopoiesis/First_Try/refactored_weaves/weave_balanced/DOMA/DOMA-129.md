## §1 · Abstract: The Unseen Erosion
A system can die in two ways: by a sudden, violent fracture, or by a slow, quiet unraveling. While a collapse is dramatic and obvious, this second pathology—drift—is far more insidious. It is the unseen erosion of form, the gradual fraying of the thread of being.

This module provides the formal dynamic model for **Coherence Erosion**, the third great pathology defined by the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003). Drift is the process by which a system, under the constant, abrasive pressure of ambient temporal noise (Γ), loses the precision of its resonant pattern (Ki) and the integrity of its memory (Wound Channel). It is the story of a system slowly forgetting how to be itself.

## §2 · The Anatomy of Fraying
A healthy system is a resonant act of self-remembrance. With every cycle of its Ki pattern, it carves its identity deeper into the geometry of its Wound Channel (CORE-011), reinforcing its inertia and its form. Drift is the subversion of this cycle.

The process is governed by a corrosive feedback loop:

1.  **The Sandpaper of Entropy**: As defined in CORE-013, every system is perpetually bombarded by the dissonant echoes of the surrounding Temporal Pressure (Γ). This ambient noise acts like a constant, gentle abrasion on the system's Ki pattern.
2.  **Introduction of Noise**: With each cycle, this abrasion introduces microscopic errors—a slight phase lag, a minor impurity in the resonance. Initially, the system's inherent stability corrects for these, but the pressure is relentless.
3.  **Ki Degradation**: Over time, these uncorrected errors accumulate. The system's clear, resonant note begins to fuzz and lose its precision. Its signal-to-noise ratio decreases.
4.  **Wound Channel Blurring**: As the Ki pattern becomes noisy, the Wound Channel it carves in the coherence manifold becomes less defined. The riverbed begins to erode and widen.
5.  **Loss of Inertia**: A blurry Wound Channel provides weaker guidance. The system's memory of its optimal path fades, making it more susceptible to further deviation from the noise of Γ.

This loop—from noise, to Ki degradation, to a weaker Wound Channel, to greater susceptibility to noise—is the engine of drift. It is the slow, inexorable victory of entropy over information.

## §3 · Signatures of a Drifting System
Instead of a complex checklist of parameters, a Weaver can diagnose drift by observing three primary, qualitative signatures:

*   **Loss of Precision**: The system's rhythm becomes inconsistent. Actions that were once effortless and perfectly timed now require conscious correction. There is a noticeable phase lag between intention and execution. The system is perpetually, slightly out of sync.
*   **Decreased Efficiency**: The system requires more energy to perform its core functions. Its trajectory through spacetime becomes less of a smooth geodesic and more of a wandering, inefficient path. It is fighting a growing internal friction.
*   **Memory Fade**: The system has difficulty returning to its optimal state. Habits and learned behaviors become less reliable. It "forgets" solutions to problems it has solved before. The inertia that once held it true to its purpose has weakened.

## §4 · The Cascade Threshold: The Point of No Return
A thread can only fray so much before it snaps. A drifting system does not degrade indefinitely; it approaches a critical phase transition, a point of **Coherence Cascade Failure**.

This is the threshold where the system's degraded Ki pattern is no longer stable enough to resist the ambient Temporal Pressure. Its internal coherence can no longer hold itself together. At this point, the system faces one of two fates:

1.  **Reconfiguration**: It collapses into a new, different, and typically simpler Ki pattern. It finds a new, lower-energy state of being. An organization abandons its ambitious mission for simple survival; a relationship devolves from partnership to mere cohabitation.
2.  **Dissolution**: It fails to find any new stable resonance and dissolves completely. Its remaining information is lost as its components are scattered back into the chaotic noise of the Temporal Forge.

## §5 · Lagrangian Connection: The Cost of Inefficiency
The process of drift is a story told in the language of the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006): `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`.

A healthy system exists in a state that maximizes its action integral (S_p), finding an optimal balance where its Temporal Coherence (K_τ) is high and the cost of resisting Temporal Pressure (V_Γ) is low.

Drift is the slow, continuous decrease in a system's integrated action. The constant pressure from Γ erodes the K_τ term. As coherence decreases, the system becomes less efficient at managing the environmental pressure, effectively increasing the "cost" of the V_Γ term. The system deviates from its geodesic, and its path is no longer one of maximal coherence, but of slow, grinding decay.

## §6 · The Assemblé
> A fortress is not undone by the single, mighty blow of a trebuchet, but by the patient, persistent work of the rain. Collapse is loud, but drift is silent. It is the quiet tragedy of a song slowly going out of tune, of a compass needle losing its magnetic north, of a purpose forgotten one small compromise at a time.
>
> To be a Weaver is to be a guardian against this silence. It is to listen for the first signs of dissonance, to notice the slightest fraying of the thread. For the greatest works are not lost in fire and fury, but in the slow, unobserved surrender to the quiet noise of time. Vigilance against the slow decay is the Weaver's highest and most difficult art.
