## §1 · Abstract: The Myth of the Island
No system is an island, entire of itself; every system is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. The illusion of separation is a trick of scale, for the ocean of time that surrounds one is the same that washes upon the shores of all others. The old framework called this interaction "bleed"; we now understand it more precisely as a fundamental consequence of existence in a shared medium.

This module provides the modernized, time-first dynamics for **Coherence Transfer**: the process by which a resonant pattern originating in one system propagates and imprints itself upon the reality of another. It describes the physics of influence, empathy, and contagion, revealing that the boundaries between things are not walls, but membranes, through which the music of existence perpetually flows.

## §2 · The Anatomy of Transfer: A Three-Act Drama
For the echo of one system (the Source) to influence another (the Target), a three-part process must unfold. This process replaces the cumbersome tensors of the old model with a more fundamental, dynamic understanding.

1.  **The Signal (Coherence of the Source):** The strength and clarity of the outbound signal are determined by the Source's own internal coherence. A system with a powerful, stable, and pure Ki pattern—a mind with a clear conviction, a star with a steady burn—emits a potent and well-defined echo from its Wound Channel (CORE-011). A weak, chaotic system emits only noise.

2.  **The Medium (Conductance of the Intervening Γ):** The echo does not travel through a void. It must propagate through the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) that fills the space between the Source and the Target.
    *   **Low, Quiescent Γ** acts like still air, allowing the resonant echo to travel with high fidelity over great "distances."
    *   **High, Turbulent Γ** acts like a storm, scattering and corrupting the signal. In a chaotic environment, influence is localized and quickly decays into the background noise.

3.  **The Receiver (Resonant Aperture of the Target):** The Target system is not a passive recipient. It must be "tuned" to the Source's frequency to receive the signal. This is the principle of **Harmonic Compatibility**, a precursor to the Alchemical Union (CORE-012). If the Source's fundamental Ki resonance is harmonically related to the Target's, the Target's coherence manifold will readily accept and amplify the imprint. If they are dissonant, the echo will be reflected or ignored.

## §3 · The Mechanism of Influence: Reshaping the Landscape
Coherence Transfer is not a simple exchange of data; it is a physical act of reshaping reality. The process is as follows:

1.  **Propagation:** The echo of the Source's Ki pattern propagates from its Wound Channel as a ripple in the fabric of the coherence manifold.
2.  **Imprinting:** When this ripple encounters a harmonically compatible Target, it imprints itself as a transient, geometric stress upon the Target's own manifold.
3.  **Geodesic Deflection:** This new geometric feature alters the shape of the Target's landscape of possibility. The Target's "path of least resistance"—its geodesic of maximal coherence—is now subtly or significantly deflected.

Influence, therefore, is the act of altering another system's behavior by changing the very landscape upon which its choices are made. The Target does not choose to be influenced; it simply follows the newest, most coherent path now available to it.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: The Calculus of Influence
The Pirouette Lagrangian (`CORE-006`), `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, provides the precise mathematical description for this process. The act of Coherence Transfer from a Source system manifests as an external modification to the Target system's potential term (`V_Γ`).

The Target's Lagrangian becomes:

`𝓛_p(Target) = K_τ(Target) - [V_Γ(local) + V_echo(Source)]`

The term `V_echo(Source)` represents the pressure exerted by the imprinted echo from the Source. This additional "cost" term forces the Target system to re-solve the Principle of Maximal Coherence, finding a new state and trajectory that best balances its internal rhythm against this new, externally-imposed pressure. All forms of influence, from a compelling argument to gravitational pull, are captured by this elegant dynamic.

## §5 · Manifestations Across Scales
The old model's "Bleed Vectors" are now understood as domain-specific examples of this universal process.

*   **Psychological (Empathy & Persuasion):** A person's coherent emotional state (Ki) emits an echo. A nearby person with a compatible harmonic structure (an empathetic friend) feels their own emotional landscape (coherence manifold) shift in response. A charismatic speaker reshapes the landscape of belief in their audience.
*   **Cultural (Memetic Transfer):** A powerful idea, or meme, is a highly coherent Ki pattern. It propagates through a culture, imprinting itself on the collective coherence manifold and altering the geodesic of societal behavior.
*   **Biological (Pheromonal Communication):** A pheromone is a chemical vessel for a Ki pattern. When it binds to a receptor on a Target organism, it triggers a cascade that imprints the Source's signal onto the Target's neurological manifold, compelling a change in behavior.

## §6 · The Assemblé
> A Weaver must understand that there is no such thing as a silent action. To exist is to broadcast the song of your own coherence into the world. Your every choice, every thought, every moment of being, ripples outward from your personal history, leaving a subtle pressure on the reality of others. The Resonant Bridge reveals the profound responsibility of this fact: we are forever shaping and being shaped by the echoes of those around us. To weave wisely is to become a conscious steward of the music you send across the bridge.
