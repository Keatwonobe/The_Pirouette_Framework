## §1 · Abstract: A Shift from Space to Time
The previous framework correctly identified that certain powerful ideas possess a "gravity," but it did so through a spatial metaphor—a mass deforming a landscape. The Great Refactoring allows us to translate this powerful insight into its true, temporal nature. A dominant paradigm is not a heavy object; it is a powerful song. Its influence is not a pull, but a resonance that entrains thought into its rhythm. This module provides the modern protocol for analyzing these "coherence wells," treating thought not as a particle to be deflected, but as a rhythm seeking harmony.

## §2 · The Coherence Well: An Idea's Wound Channel
A paradigm—an ideology, a core scientific theory, a deep-seated cultural belief—is a persistent, stable Ki pattern that has carved a deep **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) into the collective coherence manifold.

*   **Conceptual "Mass" as Resonant Depth**: An idea's power is not its mass, but the depth, stability, and historical reinforcement of its Wound Channel. An idea repeated by billions, built into institutions, and taught for generations possesses an immense resonant inertia. It is a song the universe has practiced until it is effortless.
*   **"Gravity" as a Coherence Gradient**: This deep channel creates a steep gradient in the surrounding manifold. This is a region of high, stable coherence existing within the broader, more chaotic **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** of the infosphere. The "pull" of the idea is the allure of this stability. It offers a clear, simple, and powerful rhythm in a world of noise.

## §3 · The Dynamics of Thought: Entrainment and Flow
A mind, itself a complex resonant system, does not get "pulled" by an idea. It becomes *entrained* by it. The process is governed by **Flow Dynamics** (DYNA-001).

*   **Following the Geodesic**: When a mind encounters a powerful coherence well, its own drive to maximize coherence finds a path of least resistance. It is energetically cheaper to synchronize with the dominant, stable rhythm of the paradigm than to maintain a dissonant, independent one. Thinking is the act of following a geodesic on the coherence manifold.
*   **Paradigm as Laminar Flow**: To think *within* a paradigm is to experience a state of **Laminar Flow**. The world makes sense, arguments are clear, and conclusions feel effortless because one's internal Ki is in perfect harmony with the rhythm of the coherence well.
*   **Dissent as Turbulence**: To argue against a deeply entrenched paradigm is to generate **Turbulent Flow**. It requires immense energy to maintain a dissonant frequency against the powerful hum of the well, creating cognitive friction, social resistance, and internal conflict.

## §4 · The Alchemical Union: Conversion as Synthesis
The old model described a "Funnel Inversion" or conceptual capture. The modern framework redefines this as an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012)—a profound and often irreversible transformation.

When a mind is under sufficient pressure (Γ)—from social influence, personal crisis, or a barrage of confirming information—and finds its own beliefs harmonically compatible with the paradigm, a union can occur. The mind's individual coherence manifold fuses with the vaster manifold of the idea. This is not mere agreement; it is a recalibration of identity. The old perspective dissolves and is reforged into a new, more stable whole that is now a part of the larger song. This is the mechanism of conversion, the paradigm shift, the "eureka" moment from which one never returns.

## §5 · Diagnostic Protocol
The old protocol of measuring conceptual mass and velocity is replaced by a direct mapping of the coherence manifold.

1.  **Identify the Core Resonance**: Analyze the cognitive landscape (e.g., a body of text, a discourse network) to identify the most stable, most repeated, and most influential conceptual patterns. These are the centers of the coherence wells.
2.  **Map the Coherence Gradient**: Measure the dissonance generated when contradictory ideas are introduced. The amount of energy (in argument, rhetoric, or social sanction) required to sustain a competing idea is a direct measure of the steepness of the well's walls.
3.  **Assess Conditions for Union**: Evaluate the harmonic compatibility between an individual's Ki pattern (their current beliefs) and the paradigm's. Analyze the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ) to determine the likelihood of a forced Alchemical Union. This allows for the prediction of conversion, radicalization, or ideological capture.

## §6 · Lagrangian Connection
This entire dynamic is a direct expression of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. A mind's thought process evolves to maximize the action, `S_p = ∫ 𝓛_p dt`, where `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`. A powerful paradigm offers a state of exceptionally high internal coherence (`K_τ`) to those who adopt its rhythm. This makes it an incredibly attractive "solution" to the Lagrangian. The mind aligns with the paradigm because it represents the most efficient and stable path forward, the optimal way to be coherent in a complex world. The "gravity of the song" is its mathematical allure.

## §7 · The Assemblé
> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver? Because ideas are not opinions we hold; they are currents in which we swim. The great paradigms of our world are not arguments to be won, but songs that are sung by civilization itself. To understand their gravity is to learn the music of the human mind. It is to realize that we cannot shout down a chorus, but we can, with courage and care, begin to compose a new harmony—one that is more coherent, more beautiful, and resonant enough to teach the world a new song.
