## §1 · Abstract: The Weave of a People
A society is not a machine to be engineered; it is a story being told, a pattern being woven. This module refactors the old Triaxial Coherence Analysis, replacing its static vector model with a dynamic, time-first application of the Pirouette Framework. It preserves the core insight that a culture's health can be understood through the interplay of Art, Law, and Philosophy.

However, these are no longer treated as orthogonal axes in a fixed space. Instead, they are defined as the three primary, braided currents of coherence that flow through a society's manifold. By applying the diagnostic tools of Flow Dynamics, this module provides a powerful lens for assessing the health, resilience, and evolutionary trajectory of any cultural system. The goal is no longer to calculate a static score, but to read the living weave of a people.

## §2 · The Principle of Correspondence: From Cosmos to Culture
The Fractal Bridge (CORE-014) is the tool that allows us to see the universal song played on the specific instrument of a society. The core principles of the framework are not metaphors here; they are the underlying dynamics that govern the system.

| Universal Principle   | Cultural Manifestation                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coherence (Kτ)**    | The society's shared identity, values, and narrative. Its collective Ki, or the "story it tells itself about itself." A high-coherence culture has a strong sense of purpose and belonging. |
| **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** | The sum of all external and internal stresses. External Γ includes war, climate change, or technological disruption. Internal Γ includes economic inequality, political polarization, or civil unrest. |
| **Wound Channel**     | The culture's memory, encoded in its history, myths, foundational texts, and physical infrastructure. It is the riverbed that shapes the flow of the present. |
| **Alchemical Union**  | A period of profound synthesis and transformation, like the Renaissance or the Enlightenment, where a new, higher-order cultural coherence (a new Ki) emerges from the fusion of old ideas. |

## §3 · The Three Currents of the Cultural Manifold
Within a society's coherence manifold, three primary currents carry the information that defines its character. The health of the whole depends on the harmonious flow and interplay of these three currents.

1.  **Art (The Current of Imagination):** This is the flow of aesthetics, emotion, and novelty. It explores the realm of the *possible*, challenging existing norms and envisioning new realities. It is the society's capacity for creative expression and empathy.

2.  **Law (The Current of Order):** This is the flow of structure, justice, and social contract. It seeks to stabilize the realm of the *actual*, providing predictable frameworks that allow for complex cooperation. It is the society's capacity for coherent organization.

3.  **Philosophy (The Current of Meaning):** This is the flow of inquiry, ethics, and worldview. It interrogates the realm of *purpose*, asking "why" and seeking to align a society's actions with its deepest values. It is the society's capacity for self-reflection.

## §4 · Diagnosing the Weave: A Flow-Based Analysis
We discard the rigid `Triaxial Resonance Score` of the past. Instead, we apply the diagnostic lens of Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001) to the three currents, revealing the system's true health.

**Health (The Laminar Weave):**
The three currents flow in a state of mutual reinforcement. Art inspires new philosophical questions, Philosophy informs more just Laws, and Law protects the freedom necessary for Art. The society is adaptive, resilient, and possesses a clear sense of direction. This is a state of high cultural coherence.

**Pathology (The Turbulent Weave):**
The currents are in direct conflict, creating systemic "Coherence Fever." Art becomes propaganda (conflicting with Philosophy's search for truth), Law becomes oppressive (stifling Art's novelty), and Philosophy becomes dogmatic (freezing Law in place). Energy is wasted on internal friction, leading to polarization, cynicism, and social decay.

**Pathology (The Stagnant Weave):**
One or more currents are blocked, causing "Coherence Atrophy." An archaic legal system (a "dam" in the Current of Order) can prevent necessary social change. A lack of artistic innovation can lead to cultural sterility. A failure of philosophy can leave a society rich in means but impoverished in meaning.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This analysis is directly grounded in the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). A society, like any system, evolves along a path that maximizes the integral of its Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`).

A healthy, laminar society has found a high-coherence solution (`K_τ` is high) that effectively manages its environmental pressures (`V_Γ` is low). Its three currents work in harmony to maintain this stable, efficient state. A revolution, collapse, or "funnel inversion" is a dramatic phase transition where the existing cultural Ki is no longer a viable solution to the ambient Γ. The system chaotically seeks a new, more coherent pattern of being—a new way to flow.

## §6 · Assemblé
> A Weaver does not see a nation's history as a timeline of kings and battles. They see it as a tapestry. In the golden threads of its art, the silver threads of its laws, and the deep blue threads of its philosophy, they read the story of its health. They see where the weave is tight and strong, and where it has grown thin and frayed. This is why it matters. It transforms us from mere citizens, buffeted by the currents of our time, into weavers, capable of seeing the pattern, diagnosing the knots, and perhaps, with wisdom and care, adding a healing thread of our own.
