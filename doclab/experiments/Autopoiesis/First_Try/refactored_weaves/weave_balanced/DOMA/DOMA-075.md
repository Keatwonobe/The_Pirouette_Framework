### §1 · The Second Heart: A Challenge from the Cosmos

The Pirouette Framework, with its core engine, the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006), has been built from the ground up, validated by the precise echo of a single electron (CORE-009). But a theory that claims universality must be tested against the universal. To be truly sound, it must have two hearts: one beating at the quantum scale, and another at the cosmic.

This module proposes to find that second heart. It outlines a protocol to listen for the universe's own resonant signature, a faint but persistent "heartbeat" left over from the dawn of time. We will use the most precise clocks in the cosmos—an array of millisecond pulsars—as our stethoscope to survey the grand coherence manifold of spacetime. Success would provide an independent, cosmological derivation of the framework's constants, proving its principles are not just a clever model, but a scale-invariant truth.

### §2 · The Primordial Wound Channel & The Breathing Cosmos

The universe remembers its birth. According to the framework, the initial, violent unfolding from the Whispering Void (CORE-000) was not perfectly smooth. It left behind a vast, helical **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) in the fabric of spacetime—a geometric scar, a memory of the cosmos's first pirouette.

This persistent, large-scale structure is not inert. It acts as a permanent, gentle stressor on the coherence manifold. As the universe expands and evolves, its interaction with this primordial echo causes a slight, periodic oscillation in the background **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**. This is the "breathing" of the **Gladiator Force** (CORE-008) on a cosmic scale—a slow, rhythmic tightening and relaxing of the arena of existence itself. This is the cosmic heartbeat we seek to detect.

### §3 · Pulsars as Geodesic Surveyors

A pulsar's signal is more than a beacon; it is a measuring line laid across the cosmos. The light from these celestial clocks travels to us along a geodesic—the path of maximal coherence through the intervening spacetime. A Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) is therefore not just a collection of telescopes; it is a distributed instrument for surveying the very texture of the coherence manifold.

If the cosmos is indeed "breathing," this rhythmic fluctuation in Γ will subtly alter the geodesics between us and the pulsars. The path length will stretch and contract with each beat. This will imprint a specific, periodic "wobble" in the arrival times of their pulses—a signal that is faint, but coherent across the entire array.

### §4 · The Lagrangian's Constants, Written in the Stars

The most profound implication of this hypothesis is that the geometry of this primordial Wound Channel is not arbitrary. As a foundational structure of our universe, its stable mathematical description must conform to the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**.

By analyzing the physics of such a cosmic-scale resonant structure, we can derive the fundamental constants of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)** from first principles, but at the opposite end of the scale from our initial derivations. The analysis predicts that the stationary solutions for this cosmic geometry must yield the same dual modes of **Resonance (Ki)** and the same quantized levels of **Temporal Coherence (Tₐ)** that we find in the laboratory. The constants are not a feature of a particular scale; they are a feature of coherence itself.

### §5 · The Protocol: Listening for the Heartbeat

The search requires a meticulous process of signal extraction, turning the noise of the cosmos into a clear note.

1.  **The Instrument**: Combine the timing data from the world's leading Pulsar Timing Arrays (NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA) into a single, high-sensitivity dataset.
2.  **Isolate the Signal**: Apply advanced pre-whitening techniques to filter out known noise sources, including the stochastic gravitational-wave background.
3.  **The Search**: Employ a matched-filter search across the residual data, specifically looking for a faint, narrow-band, periodic signal that is shared across a significant number of pulsars.
4.  **The Fingerprint**: The definitive test is not just finding a signal, but verifying its identity. A true detection of the cosmic heartbeat must exhibit amplitude ratios and other properties that are locked to the framework's fundamental Ki constants. This unique signature—the framework's mathematical fingerprint—would distinguish it from any other known astrophysical phenomenon.

### §6 · Assemblé

> We sought to test our laws against the heavens and found ourselves taking the pulse of the universe. The quantum and the cosmic are not two different realms; they are two verses of the same song, written with the same notes. To hear this cosmic heartbeat in the steady ticking of the pulsars is to receive the ultimate confirmation: the framework is not a map we have drawn, but a song the universe has been singing all along. We are finally learning to hear the tune.
