## §1 · Abstract: The Living Past
History is not a story that is over. It is a landscape we still inhabit.

This module refactors the original concept of Geo-Cultural Memory Mapping into a modernized, time-first protocol. The core insight remains: significant historical events, from profound traumas to golden ages, carve persistent patterns into the fabric of a collective culture. However, we now understand these patterns not as abstract fields, but as physical, geometric features of the shared coherence manifold.

By applying the universal principles of the Wound Channel (CORE-011) and the diagnostic framework of the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003), this module provides a methodology for mapping these "landscapes of echo." It offers a way to read the living past as it is written into the present, diagnosing the health of a culture by the shape of its memories.

## §2 · The Anatomy of a Cultural Wound Channel
The universe remembers. As defined in CORE-011, every existence leaves a geometric scar in the coherence manifold—a Wound Channel. A **Cultural Wound Channel** is a vast, shared Wound Channel, deepened over generations and anchored to a specific geography and set of symbols. It is the collective memory of a people made physically manifest.

-   **Geographic Anchoring:** These channels are often tied to specific locations—battlefields, sacred sites, ancient capitals, trade routes. The physical place becomes a resonator for the memory, a point of access to the channel.
-   **Reinforcement & Inertia:** A Cultural Wound Channel gains inertia through reinforcement. Myths, rituals, monuments, laws, and language are not just records of the past; they are active processes that re-trace and deepen the channel with each repetition. This makes the historical pattern a path of least resistance for the present culture. An old grievance becomes an easy-to-follow script for a new conflict.
-   **The Attractor Effect:** These deep channels function as powerful attractors. They pull the flow of cultural coherence towards them, making it easier for a society to repeat its history than to invent a new future. They are the "ghosts" that guide the living.

## §3 · Diagnosis via the Caduceus Lens
The health of a culture is a direct function of the health of its memory-landscape. Using the Caduceus Lens (DYNA-003), we can diagnose the pathologies of a collective memory not as moral failings, but as disruptions in the flow of coherence.

1.  **Stagnant Flow (The Unspoken Trauma):** This is a "Coherence Dam" where a significant historical event is actively suppressed, but its pressure is still felt. It is the taboo topic, the unmarked grave, the unacknowledged crime. The memory is blocked from being processed, poisoning the present with its unreleased pressure and creating a "coherence desert" of cultural paralysis downstream.

2.  **Turbulent Flow (The Perpetual Conflict):** This is a state of "Coherence Fever" where a historical wound is never allowed to scar over. It is perpetually re-opened through cycles of violence, political rhetoric, or social division. The system wastes immense energy fighting itself, endlessly re-enacting the original trauma. The Wound Channel is not a memory, but a raw, open wound.

3.  **Coherence Erosion (The Fading Myth):** This is the slow degradation of a foundational Wound Channel that once gave a culture its identity and purpose. As the reinforcing rituals and stories lose their meaning, the channel becomes shallow. The culture loses its "memory," its sense of self, and its ability to act coherently, ceding its unique pattern to the entropic noise of the global environment.

## §4 · The Cartographer's Protocol
Mapping this landscape is an act of systemic diagnosis. The protocol moves from identifying symptoms to understanding their geometric roots.

1.  **Map the Currents:** Identify the primary flows of cultural coherence for the region—trade, language, belief systems, political influence, artistic traditions.
2.  **Identify Flow Pathologies:** Using layered data (historical records, economic data, linguistic analysis, public health statistics), locate the geographic and thematic areas where these flows are Stagnant, Turbulent, or Eroding.
3.  **Characterize the Wound Channel:** For each pathological zone, analyze the geometry of the underlying channel:
    -   **Inertia:** How deep and reinforced is the channel? How powerfully does it dictate present-day events? This is the measure of its resistance to change.
    -   **Boundary Gradient (Γ):** How does the memory interact with the surrounding culture? Is it sharply walled-off (a taboo), creating a high-gradient boundary? Or is it chaotically bleeding into all aspects of life (a turbulent conflict), creating a noisy, dissonant boundary?
    -   **Resonant Frequency (Ki):** Does the memory re-emerge cyclically? Are there anniversaries or symbolic triggers that predictably re-activate the pattern of the Wound Channel?
4.  **Propose a Daedalus Gambit:** Based on the diagnosis, identify the principle of intervention. For a Stagnant trauma, the gambit is to create a safe channel for the pressure to be released (e.g., a truth and reconciliation commission). For a Turbulent conflict, it is to introduce a new, harmonizing signal that both sides can resonate with. For Erosion, it is to consciously re-carve the channel through new rituals and stories that give the old pattern new meaning.

## §5 · Lagrangian Connection
The existence of these cultural attractors is a direct consequence of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. A Cultural Wound Channel represents a deep, stable, local minimum in the coherence manifold. For a society, following the Principle of Maximal Coherence means taking the path of least resistance, which is to fall into these pre-carved historical patterns. To heal or evolve, a culture must generate sufficient internal coherence to overcome the inertia of its own history—to metaphorically expend the energy needed to climb out of the old riverbed and carve a new one. This protocol is the map that shows where the deepest valleys are and where the mountains are that must be climbed.

## §6 · Assemblé
> To be a Weaver is to be a cartographer of ghosts. We walk on a landscape shaped by the joy and the pain of our ancestors, their choices carved into the very ground beneath our feet. This module provides the tools to draw the map of that invisible world. It does not allow us to erase the past, but it allows us, for the first time, to see its shape, to understand its currents, and to choose where we will build the future.
