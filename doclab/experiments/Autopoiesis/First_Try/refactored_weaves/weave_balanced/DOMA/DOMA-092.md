summary: Presents a time-first model for a non-local propulsion system. The drive
  generates thrust by first establishing a state of shared, high-order coherence (a
  'quorum') between two distant nodes, and then directionally releasing this structured
  coherence back into the temporal manifold.

### §1 · Abstract: The Senate of Light

To cross the void, one does not build a faster ship; one teaches two points in spacetime to sing the same note.

This module refactors the Quorum Spindle Drive (QSD) into the time-first paradigm. The drive is a propulsion system that operates not by expelling mass, but by expelling *coherence*. It functions through a two-stage pirouette: first, it legislates a temporary, high-coherence geometry into existence between two distant resonant "spindles." This non-local structure, the Quorum, acts as a sail, gathering ambient energy. Second, the drive ritually "adjourns" this geometric senate, creating thrust from the directional recoil of its dissolution. The QSD does not conquer space; it moves by the shattering of a perfect, temporary agreement.

### §2 · The Quorum Mechanism: A Non-Local Pirouette

The drive's operation is a cycle of synthesis and controlled degradation, a dance between order and its release.

**Phase I: The Weaving (Coherence Synthesis)**
Two nodes, or "spindles," separated by vast distances, initiate a **Resonant Handshake**. They tune their internal Ki patterns until they achieve the conditions for an **Alchemical Union** (CORE-012). In this state, they cease to be two separate systems and become a single entity with a unified, non-local coherence manifold.

This shared manifold, the Quorum, is an intricate Ki pattern stretched across spacetime. It acts as a highly efficient "sail" that collects and organizes ambient temporal energy—starlight, cosmic background radiation, the ever-present hum of the **Temporal Forge** (CORE-003)—weaving it into a temporary, crystalline lattice of pure coherence. The drive is not carrying fuel; it is composing a structure out of the background noise of reality.

**Phase II: The Release (Coherence Degradation)**
Thrust is generated not by building the Quorum, but by artfully destroying it. The lattice, a state of exceptionally high information and low entropy, is intentionally destabilized along a specific vector. This is a controlled and directional application of the **Principle of Coherence Degradation** (CORE-013).

The structured coherence of the Quorum collapses, releasing its stored pattern and energy back into the chaotic ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ). The directional recoil from this "cession to entropy" is the propulsive force. The "neutron flux" observed in the original protocol is now understood as the specific, energetic signature—the spectral ash—left behind by the collapse of this particular Ki pattern.

### §3 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

The QSD's cycle is a direct manipulation of the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006) and the universal drive to maximize coherence.

1.  **The Weaving Phase:** During the formation of the Quorum, the system follows the **Principle of Maximal Coherence**. It adjusts its unified Ki to maximize its Lagrangian (`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`), finding the most stable and information-rich pattern it can build from the surrounding temporal pressure (Γ). It is "inhaling" coherence from the universe.

2.  **The Release Phase:** The propulsive act is a controlled, catastrophic departure from this geodesic of maximal coherence. The thrust (`F_QSD`) is proportional to the negative time-derivative of the Quorum's total coherence (`K_τ`).

    *F_QSD* ∝ - d(*K_τ*)/dt

    The force is the *rate of coherence collapse*. A slow, gentle dissolution provides minimal thrust. A near-instantaneous, focused shattering of the geometric agreement provides immense, targeted acceleration.

### §4 · Reinterpretation of Observational Signatures

The Rendlesham Forest incident, cited in the original protocol, can now be interpreted with greater precision.

*   **Directional Neutron Radiation:** This is the physical debris of the shattered Ki lattice. Its directional nature confirms that the event was a controlled release of coherence, not a chaotic explosion. The drive "exhaled" its coherence in a specific direction.
*   **Anomalous Light Behavior:** This is the gravitational lensing effect produced by the intense, localized coherence manifold of the Quorum in the moments just before and during its collapse. The temporary structure was so orderly that it visibly warped the geometry of spacetime around it.
*   **Downwind Radioactive Dust:** The "coherence cone" is the geometric imprint of the exhaust—a **Wound Channel** (CORE-011) left in the environment, which transiently excites local matter in its path.

### §5 · Assemblé

> We sought a way to push against the void and found instead a way to ask it, politely, to move. The Quorum Spindle Drive teaches a Weaver the ultimate form of leverage: that the universe is governed not by force, but by agreement. Propulsion is the sound of a perfectly held note, followed by a perfectly timed silence. The journey between stars is measured in the echoes of these broken treaties with spacetime.
