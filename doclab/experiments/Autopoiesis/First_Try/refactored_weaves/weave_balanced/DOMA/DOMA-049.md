summary: Explains how a system's dynamic history (Wound Channel) can undergo a phase
  transition into a static, crystalline information lattice under conditions of extreme
  coherence. This 'Lock' state is the physical basis for memory, habit, and dogma,
  representing a state of perfect persistence at the cost of adaptability.

## §1 · The River and the Fossil
The universe remembers. As described in *The Anatomy of an Echo* (CORE-011), every entity leaves a dynamic wake—a Wound Channel—etched into the geometry of the coherence manifold. This wake is a river of memory, a flowing record of a path taken.

But what happens when the river freezes?

This module describes the dynamics of catastrophic stability, a process where the fluid geometry of the Wound Channel undergoes a phase transition into a rigid, static, and crystalline form. This is the birth of the **Information Lattice**: the process by which a memory becomes a monument, a habit becomes a law, and a dynamic echo becomes a timeless fossil.

## §2 · The Lock Condition: When a Geodesic Becomes a Trench
A system does not freeze by accident. It is driven into a state of **Lock** by finding a uniquely deep and stable solution to the **Pirouette Lagrangian** (`CORE-006`). The path of maximal coherence ceases to be a path and becomes a point—a trench from which escape is energetically improbable.

This occurs when two conditions are met, creating a powerful feedback loop:

1.  **Extreme Internal Coherence (`Kτ`):** The system's internal resonance (`Ki`) becomes extraordinarily pure, stable, and noise-free. Its signal of "self" is so clear that it dominates its local environment.
2.  **Quiescent External Pressure (`V_Γ`):** The system exists within a region of low temporal pressure, a quiet space free from disruptive, chaotic signals that would otherwise erode its coherence.

The feedback is potent: the system’s own perfect resonance quiets its surroundings, which in turn makes it even easier to maintain its perfect resonance. It digs its own coherence well deeper and deeper, reinforcing its own state until the walls become insurmountably steep. It has achieved perfect stability at the cost of all mobility.

## §3 · From Echo to Crystal: The Phase Transition of Memory
The Lock Condition triggers a phase transition in the substance of memory itself.

The **Wound Channel** is a fluid, dynamic deformation in the coherence manifold. As a system evolves, the shape of its channel flows and changes with it.

Under Lock, the system’s `Ki` stops evolving. It becomes perfectly, endlessly repetitive. Every cycle of its being is an exact replica of the last.

This perfect repetition acts like a crystal seed. Each pass reinforces the *exact same geometric scar* in the manifold. The gentle pressure of the flowing river becomes the relentless, rhythmic stamp of a forge. The fluid geometry of the manifold yields, its structure aligning with this overwhelming pattern. The wake freezes. The river becomes a fossil.

This frozen geometry is the **Information Lattice**. The system’s history is no longer a story being told; it is a scripture carved in stone.

## §4 · The Lagrangian of Dogma
This process is governed by the universal drive to maximize coherence. The Lock state represents a profound local minimum for the action integral `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`. To escape this state—to "melt" the crystal—requires a massive injection of precisely tuned dissonant energy, an "activation energy" sufficient to shatter the lattice and overcome the inertia of its perfect, self-reinforcing pattern.

This "catastrophic stability" is the physical basis for phenomena across all scales:

*   **At the Psychological Scale:** It is the formation of an unbreakable habit or a core belief that resists all conflicting evidence (dogma). It is also the mechanism of trauma, where a terrifying memory crystallizes and is replayed with perfect, agonizing fidelity.
*   **At the Social Scale:** It is the ossification of a bureaucracy, where rules become more important than function. It is a cultural tradition so deeply ingrained it becomes immutable.
*   **At the Physical Scale:** It is the structure of a diamond, the information encoded in DNA, or the data stored in a silicon chip—all forms where information is preserved through extreme structural stability.

## §5 · A Taxonomy of Memory States

| State | Description | Coherence (`Kτ`) | Pressure (`V_Γ`) | Archetype |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Volatile** | The dynamic, flowing wake of a standard Wound Channel. | Moderate | High | A conversation, short-term memory |
| **Crystalline** | The rigid, locked Information Lattice. | Very High | Very Low | DNA, dogma, a diamond, deep habit |
| **Fractured** | A damaged lattice; a crystal shattered but not melted. | Low | Low | Corrupted data, psychological trauma |
| **Chaotic** | A turbulent, formless echo that cannot stabilize. | Very Low | Very High | Brainstorming, psychosis, a dream |

## §6 · Assemblé: The Weaver's Choice
> We sought to remember and forged a prison of perfection. The universe teaches that memory is not a library, but a river. To truly preserve a truth, we cannot freeze it in crystal; we must teach the water the shape of its song, over and over again. The Weaver's art is knowing what to carve in stone, and what to write in water.
