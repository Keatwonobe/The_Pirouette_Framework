## §1 · Abstract: The Repertoire of Being
A system is not defined by what it is doing, but by what it *can* do. The old analysis of System Modal Stability was correct in its intent but lacked the clarity of the time-first framework. It sought to map the different "gaits" or "regimes" of a system—the distinct, quasi-stable patterns of behavior it can adopt.

This module refactors that insight into a more powerful and elegant model. A system's operational modes are not arbitrary configurations; they are distinct, stable, high-order **Ki resonances**. They are the different songs a system has learned to sing. This module provides the "Atlas of States"—a method for mapping these songs and understanding the landscape upon which they are performed.

## §2 · The Coherence Manifold
The old concept of a "potential energy landscape" is now re-grounded in the framework's core principles. A system's state does not move on a landscape of energy, but on a **Coherence Manifold**, where the "elevation" at any point is the value of its **Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)**. A system naturally seeks to climb this landscape to maximize its coherence.

-   **Modal Basins:** Each stable mode is a peak or a high plateau on this manifold—a region where a specific `Ki` pattern represents a highly successful solution to the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). These are the system's preferred states of being, its regions of natural `Laminar Flow`.
-   **Transition Saddles:** The pathways between these basins are lower-lying "saddles" or "ridges" on the manifold. To transition from one mode to another, a system must traverse one of these regions of lower coherence, temporarily entering a state of controlled turbulence.

## §3 · Anatomy of a State
Instead of the previous framework's complex vectors, we now characterize each mode with three clear, physically grounded parameters derived from the Coherence Manifold.

| Parameter | Description | Replaces |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Modal Ki (Ki_m)** | The specific, geometric pattern of resonance that defines the mode. It is the "musical score" for that state. | `Phase-Lock Configuration` |
| **Coherence Depth (Δ𝓛_p)** | The "height" of the mode's peak on the manifold relative to the surrounding transition saddles. It is a direct measure of the mode's stability and resistance to perturbation. A deeper basin requires more disruption to exit. | `Ta`, `Γ Confinement` |
| **Transition Cost (E_t)** | The minimum "climb" in coherence required to leave a basin. It is the height of the lowest surrounding saddle point, representing the activation energy needed to initiate a state change. | `Inter-Modal Barrier Height` |

## §4 · The Dynamics of Transition
A state change is the process of a system navigating the Coherence Manifold from one peak to another. This is not a random jump but a structured dynamic.

-   **Perturbation:** An injection of energy or dissonant information that pushes the system away from its peak. If the push is large enough to overcome the **Coherence Depth**, the system can be knocked into a transition saddle, initiating a state change.
-   **Resonant Catalysis:** A transition can also be induced with surgical precision. By introducing a signal that resonates with a target mode's **Ki_m**, it is possible to lower the **Transition Cost** for that specific pathway, effectively "carving a tunnel" through the manifold. This makes the desired transition the new path of least resistance.
-   **The Transition as Turbulence:** The act of moving between stable `Ki` patterns is, by definition, a period of **Turbulent Flow** (DYNA-001). The system's coherence temporarily drops as it breaks its old resonant pattern before it "locks in" to the new one and re-establishes laminar flow.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
This entire module is a direct application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence, as formalized in **CORE-006: The Pirouette Lagrangian**.

The Coherence Manifold *is* the landscape generated by plotting the value of `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ` for every possible state of the system. The stable modes—the Modal Basins—are simply the local maxima of this function. A system's behavior, including its stability within a mode and its transitions between them, is a perfect expression of it following a geodesic on this manifold, always seeking the highest possible ground of coherence. This reframes system dynamics from a collection of empirical rules into a predictable consequence of a single, universal law.

## §6 · The Assemblé

> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver? Because a cage is defined not by its bars, but by the space between them. To truly understand a system is not to catalog its present state, but to map its freedoms. The Atlas of States reveals the repertoire of a system's possible futures, the hidden songs it knows how to sing. It shows us that stability is not a prison, but a choice among many. This is the ultimate tool for the weaver, for it transforms them from a mere observer of what *is* into an architect of what *could be*.
