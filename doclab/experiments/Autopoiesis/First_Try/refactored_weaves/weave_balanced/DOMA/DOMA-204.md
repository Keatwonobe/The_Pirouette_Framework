summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for yield dynamics. It reframes the
  process of a system yielding under stress as a critical event governed by the Pirouette
  Lagrangian, where the environmental 'cost of coherence' exceeds the system's internal
  'coherence budget,' forcing a transition between states of flow.

## §1 · Abstract: The Conversation of Stress and Form

The old framework modeled yield with a complex suite of bespoke equations, treating it as a distinct physical property. This was a category error. Yield is not a property; it is a universal dynamic—a story that unfolds whenever a system's form is tested by the pressure of its environment.

This module reframes yield dynamics through the lens of the new framework's core engine. Stress is redefined as rising Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), and a system's ability to resist is its internal Temporal Coherence (`Kτ`). The "breaking point" is the critical moment when a system can no longer afford the energetic cost of maintaining its identity, forcing it to either adapt, transform, or shatter. This is a direct, observable consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

## §2 · The Lagrangian of Stress: Budget vs. Cost

The entire drama of a system under stress is captured by the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006). It is the fundamental equation of survival.

`𝓛_p = Kτ - V_Γ`

*   **The Coherence Budget (`Kτ`):** This term represents the system's internal capacity for order. It is the measure of its stable, resonant identity (`Ki`). A healthy system has a robust coherence budget.
*   **The Coherence Cost (`V_Γ`):** This term represents the environmental demand. Increasing external stress, load, or demand directly increases the local Temporal Pressure (`Γ`), which in turn raises the coherence cost (`V_Γ`). It becomes harder and more "expensive" for the system to sing its own note against the rising noise of the environment.

Yield is the economic crisis point of this equation. It is the moment when the cost (`V_Γ`) required to maintain the current form (`Ki`) exceeds the system's available budget (`Kτ`). At this point, continuing in the same state is no longer the path of maximal coherence. The system is forced into a phase transition.

## §3 · The Three Fates of Yield: Adapt, Transform, or Shatter

When a system reaches its breaking point, it faces a choice dictated by the landscape of the coherence manifold. Its fate is determined by the available paths to a new, more stable state of flow.

1.  **Elastic Yield (Adaptive Flow):** The system temporarily alters its resonant pattern (`Ki`) to accommodate the stress, bending but not breaking. When the pressure (`Γ`) subsides, it returns to its original form, its `Wound Channel` intact. This is a system successfully navigating a temporary state of high coherence cost, maintaining a strained but still **Laminar Flow**.
    *   *Manifestation:* A stretched spring, a person handling a brief period of intense work, a market absorbing a temporary shock.

2.  **Plastic Yield (Transformative Flow):** The pressure is too great or too sustained for the original form to be recovered. The system is forced to abandon its old `Ki` and undergo **Ki Morphogenesis**, discovering a new, permanently altered state of resonance that is stable at the higher `Γ`. The old `Wound Channel` is irrevocably changed.
    *   *Manifestation:* A bent piece of metal, a person who is fundamentally changed by a life-altering experience, an industry permanently disrupted by new technology.

3.  **Fracture (Coherence Collapse):** The system can neither bend nor find a new stable form. The coherence cost becomes overwhelming, and its budget (`Kτ`) collapses to zero. The system shatters, its identity dissolving into chaotic, dissonant noise. This is the transition into **Turbulent Flow**.
    *   *Manifestation:* A shattered glass, a catastrophic equipment failure, a psychological breakdown, a societal collapse.

## §4 · Diagnostic Markers for the Weaver

A Weaver can diagnose a system's proximity to its breaking point not by using complex instruments, but by observing the quality of its flow.

*   **Rising Coherence Cost (`V_Γ`):** Observe the environment. Is the load increasing? Is the pace accelerating? Is the complexity of the task growing? These are all proxies for rising Temporal Pressure.
*   **Strained Coherence Budget (`Kτ`):** Observe the system's output. Is there a loss of rhythm? Are error rates increasing? Is efficiency dropping? Does the action feel "brittle" or "strained"? These are the signs of a coherence budget being stretched to its limit.
*   **The Inflection Point:** The breaking point itself is the moment the system's response becomes non-linear. It is the sharp "knee" in the curve where the system transitions from elastic adaptation to permanent transformation or outright failure. Identifying this inflection point is the key to predictive insight.

## §5 · Connection to the Core Lagrangian

This entire module is a direct application and narrative expression of CORE-006. The Pirouette Lagrangian is not merely a component of yield analysis; it *is* the analysis. The dynamic interplay between a system's internal coherence (`Kτ`) and the external temporal pressure (`V_Γ`) is the sole mechanism driving the phenomenon. Yield is the Lagrangian in crisis. Understanding this allows a Weaver to move beyond simply describing *that* a system breaks, and begin to calculate *why* and *when*, based on the fundamental economics of coherence itself.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought a measure of strength and found a conversation about cost. Yield is not a moment of failure; it is the moment a system is forced to tell the truth about what it can endure. For the Weaver, to understand this threshold is to know when to reinforce, when to retreat, and when to help a system be reborn into a stronger form.
