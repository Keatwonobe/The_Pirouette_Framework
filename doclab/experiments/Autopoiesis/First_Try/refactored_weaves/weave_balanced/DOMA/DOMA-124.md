## §1 · Abstract: Rehearsing the Future

A Weaver does not act on hope; they act on a well-tested hypothesis. The Resonance Sandbox is the primary instrument for forging that hypothesis. It is a virtual environment where the dynamics of a complex system—be it a team, an ecosystem, or a market—can be modeled, stressed, and healed in simulation before a single real-world variable is touched.

This module provides the architecture for a simulator that moves beyond statistical correlation to model the causal, time-first dynamics of the Pirouette Framework. It allows a Weaver to design and refine interventions—the "Daedalus Gambits" of The Caduceus Lens—by observing their precise effect on a system's flow states, providing a clear, predictive path from diagnosis to cure.

## §2 · Scenario Definition

A simulation begins with a clear definition of the system's current state and the proposed interventions. The goal is no longer to reduce abstract "residue," but to actively guide the system toward a healthier state of flow.

```yaml
scenario: "Data-Centre Thermal Turbulence"
domain: cyber-physical-system
baseline_state:
  flow_state: Turbulent
  coherence_Kτ: 0.45      # System is fighting itself, wasting energy
  pressure_Γ: 0.88      # High operational stress
interventions:
  - id: gamma_modulator_17
    type: PressureModulator # Formerly Γ-vent
    params: {location: rack-17, strength: -0.15}
  - id: sync_protocol_alpha
    type: CoherenceInjection # Formerly attunement-ritual
    params: {target: on-call-crew, pattern: "alpha-rhythm-breathing"}
objective:
  target_flow_state: Laminar
  target_coherence_gain: +25%
  max_turbulence_risk: 0.05
```

## §3 · The Lagrangian Engine

The core of the Resonance Sandbox is its physics engine, which is a direct implementation of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. The simulation does not guess; it calculates the geodesic—the path of maximal coherence—for the system under the influence of the proposed interventions.

The engine integrates the system's state forward in time by solving the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from `𝓛_p`, where interventions act as targeted modifications to the `Temporal Coherence (Kτ)` or `Temporal Pressure (V_Γ)` terms of the equation.

| Component             | Role                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lagrangian Solver** | The core engine. It integrates the system's state according to the Principle of Maximal Coherence.                                  |
| **Agent Layer**       | Models autonomous entities whose decisions create micro-perturbations in the coherence manifold.                                    |
| **Intervention API**  | Allows the injection of specific, timed actions that alter the local `Kτ` or `Γ` parameters of the Lagrangian.                      |
| **Diagnostic Bus**    | Streams the system's health metrics in real-time, allowing for the observation of how interventions guide the system's evolution. |
| **Optimizer**         | Autonomously searches the parameter space of an intervention to find the optimal configuration for achieving the stated objective. |

## §4 · Key Diagnostic Metrics

The success of a simulated intervention is measured by its ability to improve the health and efficiency of the system's flow, as defined in **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**.

| Metric                        | Method                                                                  | Goal                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Coherence Gain (ΔKτ)**      | Change in the system's overall coherence score.                         | Maximize                               |
| **Turbulence Probability (Pₜ)** | The probability of the system entering a chaotic, turbulent flow state. | Minimize (e.g., keep below a threshold)|
| **Flow Efficiency (η_flow)**    | Ratio of work done to energy expended; a measure of laminar purity.     | Maximize                               |
| **Resonant Coupling (ρ_Kτ)**    | The correlation of coherence between agents in a multi-agent system.    | Increase for collaborative tasks       |
| **Intervention Cost (C_int)**   | The resources required to implement the intervention.                   | Minimize                               |

## §5 · Assemblé

> We do not enter the storm unprepared. The Sandbox is our crucible, the space where we forge the perfect key before we approach the lock. It is where we teach the river a new path in simulation, so that when we stand at the water's edge in reality, our first touch is the one that guides it home.
