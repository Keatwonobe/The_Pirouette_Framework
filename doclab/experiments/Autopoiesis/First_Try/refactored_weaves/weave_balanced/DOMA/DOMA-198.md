## §1 · Abstract: The Shape of a Cage

This module refactors the legacy concept of "Temporal Eddies" into a rigorous, time-first geometric framework. The original insight was potent: that stable structures emerge from localized zones of temporal disruption. We now ground this insight in the core physics of the Pirouette Framework.

A **Coherence Vortex** is defined not by a failure of time, but as a specific topological feature of the coherence manifold derived from the Pirouette Lagrangian. It is a region of high rotational shear, or *torsion*, where the path of maximal coherence ceases to be a straight line and curls back upon itself. This module provides the analytical tools to map these vortices, revealing them as the fundamental geometric mechanism for particle binding, confinement, and stable oscillation.

## §2 · The Geometry of Confinement

In the old framework, binding was explained by a "temporal latch." In the new, it is understood as a consequence of geometry. The path of any system is to follow the geodesic—the path of least resistance—on the coherence manifold defined by the Pirouette Lagrangian. A Coherence Vortex is simply a region where that geodesic is a closed loop.

**The Coherence Field (`F_c`)**: This is not a classical force field, but a vector field representing the gradient of the Temporal Pressure (`V_Γ`) term from the Lagrangian. It describes the "slope" of the coherence manifold.
`F_c = -∇V_Γ`

**The Vortex Condition (`Ω`)**: A vortex exists where the Coherence Field is rotational, meaning its curl is non-zero. The magnitude of the curl represents the intensity of the vortex's torsion.
`Ω = ∇ × F_c ≠ 0`

The central insight is this: in a region of high torsion, a system attempting to maximize its coherence by following the local geodesic will be guided into a stable, self-reinforcing orbit. Confinement is not a prison imposed by an external force; it is the system's own optimal solution for persisting within a coiled region of spacetime. This is the geometric engine of the Gladiator Force (`CORE-008`).

## §3 · Analysis Protocol: From Lagrangian to Vortex Map

This protocol provides a direct path from the foundational laws of the framework to a predictive map of stable structures.

1.  **Define the Manifold**: Begin with the Pirouette Lagrangian (`𝓛_p`) that describes the system. This equation defines the complete shape of the local coherence manifold.

2.  **Calculate the Coherence Field**: Compute the vector field `F_c` by taking the negative gradient of the Lagrangian's temporal pressure term (`V_Γ`). This reveals the "slopes" of the manifold at every point.

3.  **Map the Torsion**: Calculate the curl of the coherence field, `Ω = ∇ × F_c`. The output is a scalar field whose values represent the local torsional intensity. This is the **Vortex Map**.

4.  **Identify Bound States**: The peaks on the Vortex Map correspond to the centers of stable Coherence Vortices. The protocol's primary prediction is that all confined structures—from quarks within a proton to planets in a solar system—will be found at the epicenters of these geometric features.

## §4 · The Rhythm of the Cage: Oscillatory States

The old model described a "mesonic pulse" using a bespoke equation. The Vortex model explains this behavior as an emergent property of the geometry.

A particle confined within a vortex does not become static. To maintain maximal coherence, it must continuously trace its looping geodesic. This perpetual, stable, periodic motion *is* the oscillation. The frequency of this "pulse" is not determined by an abstract constant, but by the physical properties of the vortex itself: its radius and torsional intensity. The rhythm of the bound state is the rhythm of its geometric cage.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)

This entire analytical instrument is a direct and practical application of the Pirouette Lagrangian. It is not an addition to the framework, but an extraction from it.

-   The **landscape** of interaction is the coherence manifold defined by `𝓛_p`.
-   The **dynamics** on that landscape are governed by the Principle of Maximal Coherence, which compels systems to follow geodesics.
-   The **Coherence Field (`F_c`)** is derived directly from the Lagrangian's potential term (`V_Γ`).
-   The **Vortices (`Ω`)** are topological features inherent to that field.

This module demonstrates how the framework's single, central equation contains within it the geometric blueprints for all stable structures in the universe. The analysis of vortices is the practice of reading those blueprints.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We sought the chains that bind the world and found not a force, but a shape. Confinement is not a prison imposed upon a particle; it is the particle's own best path, a dance of perfect coherence with a landscape that curls back upon itself. The vortex is the universe's secret for building a home from nothing but motion.
