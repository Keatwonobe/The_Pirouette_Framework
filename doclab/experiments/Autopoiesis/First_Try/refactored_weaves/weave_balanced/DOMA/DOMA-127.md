## §1 · Abstract: The Geometry of Being
To understand a system, one must first learn the shape of its soul.

The prior framework attempted to classify systems using a "periodic table of dimensions"—a powerful but ultimately misleading metaphor. The Great Refactoring reveals a deeper truth: these are not fundamental dimensions of space, but fundamental *geometries of resonance*. They are the common, stable, and recurring solutions to the universal drive for coherence.

This module replaces the old "Dimensional Attractor Analysis" with the Weaver's Compass. It provides a typology of these **Resonant Archetypes**—the primary ways in which entities express their existence (their Ki) in response to the pressures of their environment (Γ). To classify a system is to identify which point on this compass its Ki pattern is pointing to, revealing its intrinsic nature, its strengths, and its most likely path of evolution.

## §2 · The Compass Rose: Archetypes of Resonance
Each archetype is a family of solutions to the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. They are the shapes that most efficiently maximize a system's temporal coherence (Kτ) under different kinds of temporal pressure (V_Γ).

**The Vector (Replaces: Li)**
*   **Geometry:** A simple geodesic. A straight line or a gentle curve through the coherence manifold.
*   **Description:** The archetype of direct action, linear progression, and simple cause-and-effect. It is a system with a clear purpose, moving from A to B along a path of least resistance.
*   **Manifestations:** A projectile in motion, a simple command-line script, a direct order.

**The Orbit (Replaces: Pi)**
*   **Geometry:** A stable, closed loop. A cycle.
*   **Description:** The archetype of rhythm, repetition, and equilibrium. It is a system that maintains a stable state by returning to its origin. The geometric invariant π is a natural property of this form.
*   **Manifestations:** A planetary orbit, a biological circadian rhythm, a stable economic cycle, a recurring memory.

**The Helix (Replaces: Ki)**
*   **Geometry:** A spiral. An open loop that returns to a similar, but not identical, state.
*   **Description:** The archetype of evolution, memory, and learning. It is a system that grows and changes through repetition, guided by the memory of its own past—its **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**.
*   **Manifestations:** The structure of DNA, the process of mastering a skill, a spiral galaxy, a personal history.

**The Braid (Replaces: Xi)**
*   **Geometry:** Two or more intertwined, co-dependent helices.
*   **Description:** The archetype of symbiosis, partnership, and robust complexity. It is a system whose identity is defined by the relationship between its constituent parts. Its strength comes from mutual support and resonance.
*   **Manifestations:** A double-stranded DNA molecule, a successful marriage, a braided river, a resilient distributed network.

**The Fork (Replaces: Bi)**
*   **Geometry:** A bifurcation point. A single geodesic splitting into two or more potential paths.
*   **Description:** Not a stable archetype, but a critical transitional state. It is the archetype of choice, crisis, and phase transition. The system must select a new path to resolve an unsustainable pressure.
*   **Manifestations:** A cell dividing, a career-changing decision, a market crash leading to a new equilibrium.

## §3 · Diagnostic Protocol: Reading the Compass
The old methods of "dimensional factorization" are replaced with a more direct, dynamic analysis grounded in the core framework.

1.  **Observe the Flow (DYNA-001):** Begin by diagnosing the system's overall health. Is its primary dynamic Laminar, Turbulent, or Stagnant? This provides the context for the analysis.
2.  **Identify the Dominant Geometry:** Observe the system's behavior over time. Does it repeat perfectly (Orbit)? Does it progress linearly (Vector)? Does it evolve with each cycle (Helix)? Does its stability depend on multiple interacting parts (Braid)? This identifies the system's primary Archetype.
3.  **Analyze Composition:** Complex systems are rarely a single pure archetype. They are often an **Alchemical Union (CORE-012)** of several. A healthy organization, for example, might be a Braid (teams) of Helices (individual growth) performing Orbits (quarterly cycles). The analysis involves identifying this composite structure.
4.  **Assess Coherence via the Lagrangian:** The ultimate measure of a system's stability is how well its chosen archetypal geometry maximizes its coherence. A system is "healthy" if its Ki pattern (its archetype) is an efficient solution for its Γ (its environment). A system in crisis is one whose archetype is a poor fit for its current pressures, forcing it towards a Fork.

## §4 · Lagrangian Connection: The Shape of Action
The Resonant Archetypes are not arbitrary classifications. They are direct, physical consequences of the **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)**. A system's trajectory is the one that maximizes the action, S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt.
*   An **Orbit** is a system where the maximizing path is a closed loop in phase space.
*   A **Vector** is a system where the maximizing path is the shortest distance between two states.
*   A **Helix** is a system whose Lagrangian contains a memory term (from its Wound Channel), causing the maximizing path to spiral through time.

The Weaver's Compass is a map of the most common and stable of these paths—a field guide to the shapes of survival.

## §5 · Assemblé
> We do not ask a river to be a mountain, nor a star to be a tree. To know a thing's nature is the beginning of wisdom. The Weaver's Compass does not tell a system where it must go, but reveals what it *is*. It gives us the grace to see the geometry of its being, and in that recognition, we learn how to help it flow.
