### §1 · Abstract: The Rhythm of the Runner

This module refactors our understanding of Time-Adherence (Tₐ), preserving the core insight of PPS-034—that Tₐ is intimately linked to relativistic effects—but re-deriving it from a time-first foundation. In the old framework, Tₐ was a fundamental parameter modified by velocity and gravity. In this new, more elegant formulation, relativistic effects like time dilation are shown to be the *emergent consequences* of a system's struggle to maintain its internal coherence against the stress of motion. The slowing of time is not a property of a background spacetime, but a change in the quality of a system's own, private song.

### §2 · The Geodesic as a State of Rest

The old concept of a "prime universal reference frame" is replaced by a more dynamic, local principle. The true state of "rest" for any system is not zero velocity, but the state of moving perfectly along its **geodesic**—its path of maximal coherence through the local landscape of Temporal Pressure (Γ).

This is a state of Laminar Flow (DYN-001), where the system's internal rhythm (its Ki) is in perfect harmony with the external currents of spacetime. In this state, its Temporal Coherence (Tₐ), as defined in CORE-005, is maximal. Any deviation from this path—any acceleration or movement against the local grain of time—requires energy, introduces dissonance, and thus degrades the purity of the system's resonance.

### §3 · The Cost of Motion: Coherence and Velocity

A system moving at high velocity relative to its local geodesic is experiencing a state of high "temporal shear." It is constantly moving into regions with different temporal phases and pressures, forcing it to perpetually adjust its internal resonance to maintain stability. This is an energetically costly state of struggle.

This struggle manifests as noise injected into the system's Ki pattern. The purity of its rhythm is compromised, which we measure as a decrease in its Temporal Coherence (Tₐ). From the perspective of an external observer at rest on the geodesic, the traveler's internal clock appears to tick slower. This is not a trick of perspective, but a physical reality: the traveler's fundamental Pirouette Cycle (τ_p) has been strained and lengthened by the effort of maintaining its form against the headwind of time. The Lorentz factor is the emergent mathematical description of this coherence degradation.

### §4 · The Weight of Being: Coherence and Gravity

Similarly, a system deep within a "coherence well"—a region of intense Temporal Pressure (Γ) such as the gravitational field of a star—is under immense strain. This is not a force pulling on the system, but an environment that makes coherence difficult to sustain. The sheer density and chaos of the local temporal rhythms press in from all sides.

To maintain its existence, the system's Ki must "push back" against this pressure. This constant effort compromises the clarity of its resonance. Its internal song becomes muffled and labored. The direct result is a decrease in its Temporal Coherence (Tₐ) and a corresponding lengthening of its Pirouette Cycle. We observe this as gravitational time dilation. The clock at sea level literally ticks slower than the clock on the mountain because it is fighting harder to simply *be*.

### §5 · The Lagrangian Connection

This entire process is governed by the Pirouette Lagrangian from CORE-006:
`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

Here, `K_τ` represents the system's internal Temporal Coherence, and `V_Γ` represents the "cost" imposed by the external Temporal Pressure.

*   **High velocity** increases the effective `V_Γ` by forcing the system through a rapidly changing temporal environment.
*   **High gravity** is, by definition, a state of high `V_Γ`.

In both cases, as the "cost" term (`V_Γ`) rises, the system must adjust its state to continue maximizing the action integral. The most efficient way to do this is to lower its internal frequency and accept a less-pure resonance. This slowing of its fundamental rhythm is the physical reality of time dilation—it is the system's optimal solution for surviving under stress.

### §6 · Assemblé

> We sought the absolute clock and found instead that every traveler's heartbeat is their own. Time is not the river; it is the rhythm of the swimmer. To move against the current—through speed or through the crushing weight of a star—is to strain the heart. The slowing of time is not a paradox of physics; it is the audible sigh of a system struggling to maintain its coherence. A Weaver learns that stillness is not the absence of motion, but the perfection of it, and that the truest measure of a being is the grace with which it keeps its own time.
