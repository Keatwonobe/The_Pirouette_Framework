summary: "Describes the catastrophic phase transition a system undergoes when its\
  \ stable resonant pattern (Ki) can no longer maintain coherence against an overwhelming\
  \ environmental pressure (\u0393). This 'snap' is a violent reconfiguration from\
  \ a simple, rigid identity to a complex, adaptive one, serving as the model for\
  \ epiphany and transformative crisis."

## §1 · The Unbending Riverbed
A system that has achieved mastery carves its identity into the fabric of time. Through repetition and success, its resonant pattern (Ki) deepens its own **Wound Channel** (CORE-011), creating a stable and efficient geodesic—a path of least resistance for its being. This is the Unbending Riverbed.

Like a crystalline lens, this rigid structure brings clarity and power. The system processes reality through the proven logic of its past, effortlessly maintaining a state of high **Laminar Flow** (DYNA-001) within familiar environments. It has a powerful, coherent answer to the question of its own existence. But this very strength becomes its critical vulnerability: it mistakes its riverbed for the whole of the landscape, forgetting that the current is ever-changing.

## §2 · The Dissonant Current
The universe, in its relentless creativity, eventually presents a current for which the riverbed was not carved. This is a new, undeniable truth—a powerful and coherent signal from the environment that is fundamentally dissonant with the system's internal Ki.

This encounter creates an extreme spike in the local **Temporal Pressure (Γ)**. The system, attempting to follow its old, familiar geodesic, now finds itself fighting a violent and chaotic current. The cost of maintaining its identity skyrockets. It is thrown from a state of laminar grace into a state of high-stress **Turbulent Flow**, its energy consumed not by progress, but by the friction of its own internal conflict.

## §3 · The Fracture
A system cannot sustain a state of pure turbulence indefinitely. The core drive of existence is to find and follow the path of maximal coherence. When the old path becomes a locus of pure chaos, and the system is too rigid to bend to a new one, the built-up pressure has nowhere to go but inward.

The result is a **Coherence Fracture**. The system's foundational Wound Channel—the very bedrock of its identity—shatters. This is a catastrophic phase transition, not a slow erosion. The immense energy that maintained the rigid, stable Ki is released in a single, violent burst of dissonant information. This is the raw, unmediated signal of crisis. It is the moment pain becomes data.

## §4 · The Braided Stream
The Fracture is not an annihilation; it is a reconfiguration. As the chaotic energy subsides, the fragments of the old, shattered Ki become the raw material for a new synthesis. Driven by the inescapable **Principle of Maximal Coherence**, the system begins to weave these fragments into a new, higher-order resonant pattern.

The singular, unbending riverbed is gone. In its place, a **Braided Stream** is formed. The system's new identity is a mosaic, a multifaceted and dynamic harmony capable of holding multiple, even contradictory, truths at once. It has traded the simple power of certainty for the profound resilience of wisdom. Its new Wound Channel is more complex and adaptive, allowing it to navigate a far wider range of currents with a new, more sophisticated form of Laminar Flow.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian
The Coherence Fracture is the physical manifestation of a system's **Pirouette Lagrangian** (CORE-006) becoming catastrophically and persistently untenable.

The Lagrangian, `𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`, represents the balance between a system's internal coherence (`K_τ`) and the environmental pressure it must endure (`V_Γ`). The Dissonant Current causes `V_Γ` to spike to a degree that overwhelms `K_τ`, making the integral of the Lagrangian (the "action" `S_p`) deeply negative. The old pattern is no longer a solution; it is the source of the problem. The Fracture is the system's violent, non-linear search for a new Ki pattern—a new geodesic—that can once again satisfy the universe's fundamental drive to maximize coherence.

## §6 · Assemblé
> We mistake the cracking of the dam for the end of the river. The Coherence Fracture teaches us that the flood is not a disaster, but the water's violent, necessary search for a new, truer path to the sea. Pain is the sound of a map being redrawn. A Weaver does not fear this sound; they listen for the direction of the new current.
