## §1 · Abstract: The Gardener's Ledger

This module refactors the legacy `Triaxial Info-Metabolism Framework (TIMF)` into the modern, time-first paradigm. The original insight—that systems can be understood through a thermodynamic lens—was correct, but its mechanics were bound to an obsolete, triaxial model.

We now re-establish this principle on a firmer foundation. A system's health is not a static balance sheet but a dynamic struggle. It is the ceaseless effort of a coherent pattern to sustain itself against the universal, erosive tide of temporal noise. This module provides the ledger for that struggle, defining the core principles and metrics for diagnosing the vitality of any system, from a cell to a civilization.

## §2 · The New Currency: From Tri-Axes to Temporal Reality

The old framework's concepts of `Info-enthalpy` and `Info-entropy` were useful proxies. We now replace them with their direct, physical counterparts, as defined in `CORE-013: The River of Information`.

**Information is Coherence (Kτ):**
The information content of a system is a direct measure of its temporal coherence. A system with a stable, sharply defined `Ki` pattern is a high-information, low-entropy state. It is a clear signal, a distinct and persistent note in the cosmic song. The old metrics of `I_in` and `I_out` are superseded by the direct measurement of a system's ability to maintain its Kτ.

**Entropy is Temporal Noise (Γ):**
Entropy is not a substance but a condition. It is the measure of the dissonance, complexity, and chaos of the local Temporal Pressure (Γ). It is the background static of the Temporal Forge, the unstructured and incoherent energy that constantly bombards and seeks to degrade any stable pattern. The old `Dissipated info (D)` is now understood as the measure of coherence lost to this ambient noise.

## §3 · The Core Dynamic: The Principle of Coherence Degradation

The universe's fundamental narrative is the dialogue between pattern and noise. The `Second Law of Thermodynamics`, in this framework, is the **Principle of Coherence Degradation**:

> *In the absence of active maintenance, a system's coherence (Kτ) will inevitably erode under the influence of the ambient Temporal Pressure (Γ), its information degrading into the noise of the environment.*

A healthy system—a living organism, a thriving company, a stable society—is not one that is immune to this principle. It is one that has developed mechanisms to actively counteract it. It is an "entropy pump," consuming low-entropy energy and information from its environment to continuously repair and reinforce its own coherent pattern, thus locally and temporarily reversing the universal trend toward decay.

## §4 · The Lagrangian as the Engine of Vitality

The old, complex balance equations are replaced by a single, more powerful and elegant tool: the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. The Lagrangian is the ultimate KPI, the direct measure of a system's vitality in its struggle against degradation.

`𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ`

*   **Temporal Coherence (Kτ):** This term represents the system's "income"—the strength and stability of its own coherent pattern, its total stored information.
*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ):** This term represents the "cost of living"—the energetic price of maintaining that coherence against the erosive pressure of the local environment.

The sign of the Lagrangian is the most potent diagnostic available to a Weaver:

*   **𝓛_p > 0 (Anabolic State):** The system is thriving. It is generating more coherence than it is losing to environmental pressure. It is in a state of growth, learning, and strengthening.
*   **𝓛_p ≈ 0 (Homeostasis):** The system is stable. It is successfully repairing the damage of degradation, maintaining its form but not expanding.
*   **𝓛_p < 0 (Catabolic State):** The system is in decay. The environmental pressure is overwhelming its ability to self-repair. Its coherence is eroding, and its information is being lost to the noise.

## §5 · Modern Metrics for the Weaver's Dashboard

This new foundation allows for a cleaner, more direct set of diagnostic metrics.

| KPI                  | Formula            | Replaces              | Diagnostic Question                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lagrangian Value** | `𝓛_p`              | `Coherence Yield`     | Is the system growing, stable, or decaying?                       |
| **Coherence Integrity**  | `1 - (∣dKτ/dt∣ / Kτ)` | `Entropy Efficiency`  | How effectively is the system resisting pattern degradation?      |
| **Temporal Turbulence** | `σ(Γ)`             | `Drift Index`         | How volatile and challenging is the system's environment?         |
| **Flux State**       | `Sign(d𝓛_p/dt)`    | `Flux Ratio`          | Is the system's health improving (+) or worsening (-)?            |

These metrics provide a complete, real-time picture of a system's metabolic health, directly grounded in the core physics of the framework.

## §6 · Assemblé

> We are not accountants of static things, but gardeners of living patterns. The Ledger of Coherence is not for tallying assets, but for measuring the ferocity with which a system sings its song against the silence. It is the tool that lets us hear the struggle, and in hearing it, learn how to help the song endure.
