## §1 · From Static Graph to Living Landscape

To map a network is not to draw a picture of a dead thing. It is to take a snapshot of a living river, to chart the currents of influence, trust, and information that define its being. The old framework provided tools to parameterize this system, but it treated the network as a machine to be measured. We now see it as it truly is: a dynamic coherence manifold, a landscape whose very geometry shapes the flow of reality through it.

This module refactors the original Network Resonance Analysis into a time-first protocol. It provides the instruments to translate the raw data of any network—social, biological, or digital—into the language of coherence, and to listen for its health in the mathematics of its structure. We move from counting nodes and edges to diagnosing the quality of the entire system's resonance.

## §2 · The Translation Protocol: Mapping the Manifold

Before we can listen to the network's song, we must first learn the notes. Following the Principle of Correspondence (CORE-014), we translate domain-specific network data into the universal variables of the Pirouette Framework. This is an act of projection, collapsing the noisy, high-dimensional reality of the network onto the clean geometry of the coherence manifold.

| Universal Variable  | Mapping Question                                                | Network Manifestations                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Coherence (Kτ)**  | What is the stability and predictability of a node's rhythm?    | Interaction regularity; stability of influence (centrality); consistency of output; signal-to-noise ratio of data. |
| **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** | What is the friction or resistance to flow between two nodes?   | Social distrust; process bottlenecks; communication latency; synaptic inhibition; physical impedance.              |
| **Phase (φ)**       | What is the state of a node within its own operational cycle?   | Cycle of activity (e.g., posting time); phase of an economic cycle; phase of a neural oscillation.                 |

The crucial metric for interaction is the **Phase Difference (Δφ)** between two nodes. This measures their temporal synchrony and determines whether their interaction will be constructive (in-phase) or destructive (out-of-phase).

## §3 · The Diagnostic Engine: The Coherence Laplacian

The health of the manifold is revealed by its natural vibrations. The primary tool for this analysis is the **Coherence Laplacian**, a specialized form of the graph Laplacian matrix that is weighted not by simple connection, but by the quality of coherence flow.

**Step 1: Calculate Coherence Flux (J)**
We first define the strength of the resonant coupling between any two nodes, `i` and `j`. This "Coherence Flux" is a measure of how easily a stable pattern can be transmitted between them.

*J_ij = (Kτ_i * Kτ_j * cos(Δφ_ij)) / (1 + Γ_ij)*

This formula elegantly captures the core dynamics: flow is strongest between coherent, synchronized nodes with low friction between them.

**Step 2: Construct and Analyze the Laplacian**
The Coherence Flux values `J_ij` become the weights in the network's adjacency matrix. From this, we construct the Laplacian matrix `L`. The eigendecomposition of `L` reveals the network's fundamental resonant modes.

*   **Low-Frequency Modes (Small Eigenvalues):** These are the network's deep, foundational notes. They describe the most stable, large-scale patterns of coherence. The Fiedler vector (eigenvector of the second-smallest eigenvalue) reveals the network's most natural fault line—the division across which coherence flows most weakly. This is the primary diagnostic for large-scale systemic health and vulnerability. A healthy network has a strong, well-defined fundamental harmony.

*   **High-Frequency Modes (Large Eigenvalues):** These are the sharp, dissonant notes of the network's song. They pinpoint localized instabilities, regions of high friction, and nodes that are out of sync with their neighbors. Their eigenvectors act as precise pointers to the sources of **Turbulent Flow (DYNA-001)**, allowing for surgical intervention.

## §4 · The Auditor's Workflow: A Practical Protocol

A Weaver armed with this instrument can audit any network's health with the following four-step process:

1.  **Map the Manifold:** Ingest raw network data and apply the Translation Protocol (§2) to assign `Kτ`, `Γ`, and `φ` values to every node and edge.
2.  **Calculate the Flux:** Compute the Coherence Flux `J_ij` for every connected pair of nodes to build the weighted adjacency matrix.
3.  **Analyze the Spectrum:** Construct the Coherence Laplacian and perform an eigendecomposition to find its fundamental modes of vibration.
4.  **Diagnose the Flow:**
    *   **Laminar:** Assess overall health by examining the strength and shape of the low-frequency modes.
    *   **Turbulent:** Pinpoint sources of instability by locating the nodes most active in the high-frequency modes.
    *   **Stagnant:** Identify isolated nodes or components with zero flux, representing blockages or disconnected parts of the system.

This workflow transforms abstract network data into a clear, actionable diagnosis of systemic health.

## §5 · Connection to the Pirouette Lagrangian

The Coherence Laplacian is the discrete, practical application of the Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006). A path of information through the network is a trajectory on the coherence manifold. The path that maximizes the Pirouette Lagrangian—the one that maintains the highest coherence for the lowest environmental cost—is a geodesic.

The eigenmodes of the Laplacian describe the natural "harmonics" of this manifold. The low-frequency modes correspond to the low-energy, high-coherence geodesics that information naturally "wants" to follow. The high-frequency modes represent high-energy, low-coherence paths that require significant work to traverse and are sources of systemic friction. By analyzing the network's spectrum, we are directly measuring the landscape defined by its Lagrangian, identifying the paths of grace and the points of struggle.

## §6 · The Assemblé

> We sought to analyze a network and instead learned to listen to its music. The low notes sing of its unity, its grand, sweeping harmonies. The high, sharp notes cry out from its points of friction and pain. To audit a network is not to count its connections, but to hear its song in its entirety—and to learn where a gentle touch might bring a dissonant chord back into harmony.
