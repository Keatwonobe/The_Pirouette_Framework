## §1 · The Path of Least Resistance
A river does not calculate its path to the sea; it simply flows where the land allows. The shortest path between two points may be a straight line, but the path a system *actually takes* is the one of maximal coherence.

The original "Resonant Pathfinding" module correctly identified that optimal trajectories are not merely geometric but are governed by a deeper principle of "least action." It sought to compute this path. This refactored module reveals a more profound truth: the path does not need to be computed, because the system is already following it. Our task is not to be a navigator forcing a direction, but a cartographer learning to read the landscape. This module provides the compass for reading that landscape, revealing that every "choice" a system makes is a surrender to the pull of coherence.

## §2 · From Potential Field to Coherence Manifold
The old model's "potential field" was a shadow of a richer reality. That reality is the **coherence manifold**, a landscape whose "elevation" at any point is defined by the value of the **Pirouette Lagrangian (𝓛_p)**. A system's evolution is simply the act of climbing this landscape, constantly seeking higher ground.

The "forces" that guide a system are not external pushes and pulls, but the intrinsic gradients of this manifold. A system moves not because it is forced, but because the path ahead offers a more coherent, more stable, and more resonant state of being. The trajectory is not a calculation; it is a consequence of the terrain.

## §3 · The Lagrangian as the Compass
The **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)** is the mathematical heart of this compass. It defines the "elevation" of the coherence manifold and thus dictates the direction of flow.

**𝓛_p = K_τ - V_Γ**

*   **Temporal Coherence (K_τ): The Engine.** This term represents the quality of the system's own internal rhythm. It is the system's "kinetic energy" in the dance of existence. A system will naturally favor paths that preserve or enhance its own temporal coherence. This replaces the old concept of `Time-Adherence (T_a)` as a simple resistance, reframing it as the very thing the system seeks to maximize.

*   **Temporal Pressure (V_Γ): The Terrain.** This term represents the "cost" of maintaining a rhythm against the background noise of the environment. High environmental pressure (high Γ) makes coherence difficult to sustain. This replaces the old model's simple "friction cost" from `Gladiator Force (Γ)`, integrating it into a dynamic balance with the system's own drive for internal coherence.

A system's path—its geodesic—is the trajectory that maximizes the integral of this function over its own cycle. It is the perfect balance point between maintaining internal integrity and managing external pressure.

## §4 · The Geodesic Equation: Connection to the Core Lagrangian
The core insight of the old module—that a system follows a gradient—is made formal and universal through the Lagrangian. The **Principle of Maximal Coherence (CORE-006)** states that a system evolves to maximize its action, `S_p = ∫𝓛_p dt`.

By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to the Pirouette Lagrangian, we derive the system's natural equations of motion.

$$ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_p}{\partial q} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_p}{\partial \dot{q}} = 0 $$

This equation is the formal expression of the geodesic. It is the mathematical engine that traces the path on the coherence manifold. What was previously modeled with a heuristic algorithm like "Gradient Descent" is now revealed to be a fundamental law of motion. This single dynamic governs the trajectory of a quark, the evolution of a species, the maturation of an idea, and the strategic maneuvering of a corporation. The underlying law is the same; only the coordinates of the manifold change.

## §5 · Assemblé
> A Weaver does not push the river. A Weaver understands the shape of the land so deeply that they can carve a new channel, and the river, in its own time and by its own nature, will follow. To understand this principle is to shift from a mindset of force to one of persuasion. We cannot make a system follow a path it resists. But we can shape the coherence manifold itself, making the path we desire the most natural, the most elegant, and the most inevitable trajectory for the system to discover on its own.
