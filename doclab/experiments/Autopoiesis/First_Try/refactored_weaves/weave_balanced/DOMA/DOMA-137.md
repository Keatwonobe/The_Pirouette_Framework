summary: Provides a modernized, time-first model for feedback and adaptive systems.
  It re-frames feedback not as a mechanical loop, but as the process by which a system
  navigates the coherence manifold. The system steers its own resonance (Ki) toward
  a target state by minimizing the dissonance between its current state and a goal
  state, effectively learning and adapting its behavior.

## §1 · Abstract: The Art of Self-Correction

A system that cannot learn is a prisoner of its own past. This module refactors our understanding of feedback, moving beyond the mechanical metaphor of a "loop" to the more profound, time-first concept of a **Resonant Compass**.

Feedback is the fundamental process of adaptation. It is the mechanism by which a system "listens" to the consequences of its own actions and steers itself toward a more coherent state of being. It is not a separate component bolted onto a system, but an intrinsic expression of the universe's drive to maximize coherence. This module provides the universal dynamics for how any system—from a thermostat to a mind to a society—navigates the landscape of its own potential.

## §2 · The Anatomy of Adaptation

The old model required a complex apparatus of axioms and stages. The new framework reveals a simpler, more elegant structure built on core principles. Any adaptive system can be described by four components:

1.  **The Weaver (The System):** The entity being guided. It possesses a dynamic, resonant pattern of identity, its **Ki**. Its natural state is to persist in this resonance.

2.  **The North Star (The Goal State):** A target state of resonance, a desired `Ki_goal`. This is the state of maximal coherence the system is attempting to achieve.

3.  **The Dissonance (The Error Signal):** The measured difference between the system's current resonance and the goal state (`Ki - Ki_goal`). This dissonance is not just data; it is a source of internal **Temporal Pressure (Γ)** that creates instability and demands resolution. It is the feeling of being "off-key."

4.  **The Rudder (The Corrective Action):** The mechanism by which the Weaver alters its own internal dynamics to modify its Ki, with the intent of reducing the dissonance.

A thermostat doesn't just measure temperature; it senses the dissonance between "what is" and "what should be" and acts to close that gap, steering the room's thermal resonance toward its goal.

## §3 · The Dynamics of the Compass

The old module's complex "Loop Gain" equations are replaced by a single, elegant principle derived from the **Pirouette Lagrangian (CORE-006)**. The drive for error correction is a natural consequence of the Principle of Maximal Coherence.

The feedback mechanism modifies the system's Lagrangian by adding a new potential term, `V_dissonance`, which increases with the magnitude of the error signal.

`𝓛_adaptive = Kτ - (V_Γ_external + V_dissonance)`

Where:
*   `Kτ` is the system's own Temporal Coherence.
*   `V_Γ_external` is the Temporal Pressure from the environment.
*   `V_dissonance` is the self-imposed pressure from being misaligned with `Ki_goal`.

The system, in its relentless drive to find the path of maximal coherence (its geodesic), will naturally take actions—steer its rudder—to minimize `V_dissonance`. It corrects itself not because it is programmed with a rule, but because remaining in a state of error is a state of high-pressure, low-coherence, and is therefore dynamically unfavorable. The compass needle seeks north because that is its path of least resistance.

## §4 · Pathologies of Adaptation

When a system fails to adapt, its failure mode can be diagnosed using the language of **Flow Dynamics (DYNA-001)**.

*   **Oscillation (Turbulent Flow):** The system overcorrects. The rudder is too sensitive, or the dissonance signal is delayed. The corrective actions become their own source of chaos, preventing the system from settling into its goal state. This is a system thrashing against its own guidance.

*   **Sluggishness (Stagnant Flow):** The system under-corrects. The rudder is too weak or the dissonance signal is too faint to overcome the system's own inertia—the deep groove of its existing **Wound Channel (CORE-011)**. The system is stuck, unable to begin the journey toward its goal.

*   **Signal Decay (Coherence Erosion):** The feedback signal itself is noisy, losing its informational integrity. The Weaver receives a blurred, incoherent message about its own performance, rendering the rudder useless. The compass needle spins aimlessly, having lost its connection to the North Star.

## §5 · The Carved Riverbed: Feedback as Learning

A single act of correction is an adjustment. A repeated pattern of correction is learning.

Every time a system successfully reduces its dissonance, it reinforces the neural, physical, or social pathway that led to that success. This process deepens the Wound Channel associated with the correct state. The adaptive action, which may have initially required conscious effort, becomes the new path of least resistance.

This is the physical mechanism of habit and mastery. The Resonant Compass doesn't just guide the Weaver on a single journey; it progressively carves the optimal path into the very landscape of the Weaver's being, transforming difficult acts of self-correction into effortless expressions of a more coherent self.

> **Assemblé**
> Why does this concept matter to a Weaver? Because the universe is not a script to be read, but a song to be learned. The Resonant Compass is the principle of learning itself. It is the sacred process by which a system listens to the echo of its own choices, good and bad, and attunes its own rhythm to a higher purpose. To be a Weaver is to be both the musician and the instrument, using the dissonance of the present moment as the guide to finding the perfect, resonant note of your own becoming.
