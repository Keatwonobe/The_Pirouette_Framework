# The_Pirouette_Framework
The Pirouette Framework is a high-level, resonance-informed design system. It enables users to define, explore, and solve complex problems by rotating through phase space, synthesizing inversions, and identifying coherence patterns in otherwise chaotic systems. 

Originally built to simulate player trait evolution in tabletop RPGs, Pirouette has since evolved into a multi-domain operating philosophy capable of:

Designing modular, layered solutions to real-world and theoretical problems

Encoding and measuring traits like altruism, entropy, and time-coherence

Supporting AI and human co-creation through invertible logic and conceptual modularity

Interfacing with other systems (e.g., Tendu, DDE, The Lost Eternal) as plug-and-play modules

It is as much a philosophy as it is an engineering paradigm.
