# The_Pirouette_Framework
The Pirouette Framework is a high-level, resonance-informed design system. It enables users to define, explore, and solve complex problems by rotating through phase space, synthesizing inversions, and identifying coherence patterns in otherwise chaotic systems. 

Originally built to simulate player trait evolution in tabletop RPGs, Pirouette has since evolved into a multi-domain operating philosophy capable of:

Designing modular, layered solutions to real-world and theoretical problems

Encoding and measuring traits like altruism, entropy, and time-coherence

Supporting AI and human co-creation through invertible logic and conceptual modularity

Interfacing with other systems (e.g., Tendu, DDE, The Lost Eternal) as plug-and-play modules

It is as much a philosophy as it is an engineering paradigm.



**Pirouette** is a modular, resonance-based framework for solving problems, modeling entities, and designing complex systems. It encodes both philosophical insight and practical structure, allowing users to simulate time-adherent agents, discover coherence within chaotic systems, and invert problems into paths of resolution.

Pirouette connects and orchestrates various sub-frameworks‚Äîlike **Tendu**, **Resolv√®**, **DDE**, and **The Lost Eternal (TLE)**‚Äîwhile enabling agents, personas, and symbolic tools to interact through defined modules.

## üß∞ Getting Started (Manual Setup)

If you'd rather explore the system locally:

### üì¶ Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (for any tools)
- LaTeX (for compiling `docs/` volumes)
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)

Optional:
- `jq` (for working with `.json` templates)
- `make` (for future automation support)
